https://openalex.org/W2032317739,"Massive galaxies in the young Universe, ten billion years ago, formed stars at surprising intensities. Although this is commonly attributed to violent mergers, the properties of many of these galaxies are incompatible with such events, showing gas-rich, clumpy, extended rotating disks not dominated by spheroids. Cosmological simulations and clustering theory are used to explore how these galaxies acquired their gas. Here we report that they are 'stream-fed galaxies', formed from steady, narrow, cold gas streams that penetrate the shock-heated media of massive dark matter haloes. A comparison with the observed abundance of star-forming galaxies implies that most of the input gas must rapidly convert to stars. One-third of the stream mass is in gas clumps leading to mergers of mass ratio greater than 1:10, and the rest is in smoother flows. With a merger duty cycle of 0.1, three-quarters of the galaxies forming stars at a given rate are fed by smooth streams. The rarer, submillimetre galaxies that form stars even more intensely are largely merger-induced starbursts. Unlike destructive mergers, the streams are likely to keep the rotating disk configuration intact, although turbulent and broken into giant star-forming clumps that merge into a central spheroid. This stream-driven scenario for the formation of discs and spheroids is an alternative to the merger picture."

https://openalex.org/W1979038578,"Using two-colour imaging and high resolution TIRF microscopy, we investigated the assembly and maturation of nascent adhesions in migrating cells. We show that nascent adhesions assemble and are stable within the lamellipodium. The assembly is independent of myosin II but its rate is proportional to the protrusion rate and requires actin polymerization. At the lamellipodium back, the nascent adhesions either disassemble or mature through growth and elongation. Maturation occurs along an alpha-actinin-actin template that elongates centripetally from nascent adhesions. Alpha-Actinin mediates the formation of the template and organization of adhesions associated with actin filaments, suggesting that actin crosslinking has a major role in this process. Adhesion maturation also requires myosin II. Rescue of a myosin IIA knockdown with an actin-bound but motor-inhibited mutant of myosin IIA shows that the actin crosslinking function of myosin II mediates initial adhesion maturation. From these studies, we have developed a model for adhesion assembly that clarifies the relative contributions of myosin II and actin polymerization and organization."
https://openalex.org/W1966342514,"Stimulus-evoked neural activity is attenuated on stimulus repetition (repetition suppression), a phenomenon that is attributed to largely automatic processes in sensory neurons. By manipulating the likelihood of stimulus repetition, we found that repetition suppression in the human brain was reduced when stimulus repetitions were improbable (and thus, unexpected). Our data suggest that repetition suppression reflects a relative reduction in top-down perceptual 'prediction error' when processing an expected, compared with an unexpected, stimulus."
https://openalex.org/W2067409327,"The Antarctic Peninsula is one of the most rapidly warming locations on Earth, but it has been difficult to establish whether continent-wide changes are comparable to the clear upward trend in global average temperature. This is because most of the continuous records from ice-sheet weather stations are coastal, providing little information on the continental interior. This problem is by-passed in a new reconstruction of Antarctic surface temperature trends for 1957–2006, based on satellite data (with good spatial coverage for a short period) and air temperatures from weather stations (for a long timescale), blended via an algorithm that estimates missing data points in climate fields. The resulting record, more reliable than previous gap-filling exercises, suggests that overall the continent is warming by about 0.1 °C per decade, with stronger warming in winter and spring and over West Antarctica. The Antarctic Peninsula is known to be warming rapidly, but the overall pattern of climate change for the full Antarctic continent has been uncertain. This work finds that the entire continent is warming at a rate of 0.12 ± 0.07 °C per decade, with stronger warming in winter and spring and over West Antarctica. Assessments of Antarctic temperature change have emphasized the contrast between strong warming of the Antarctic Peninsula and slight cooling of the Antarctic continental interior in recent decades1. This pattern of temperature change has been attributed to the increased strength of the circumpolar westerlies, largely in response to changes in stratospheric ozone2. This picture, however, is substantially incomplete owing to the sparseness and short duration of the observations. Here we show that significant warming extends well beyond the Antarctic Peninsula to cover most of West Antarctica, an area of warming much larger than previously reported. West Antarctic warming exceeds 0.1 °C per decade over the past 50 years, and is strongest in winter and spring. Although this is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica, the continent-wide average near-surface temperature trend is positive. Simulations using a general circulation model reproduce the essential features of the spatial pattern and the long-term trend, and we suggest that neither can be attributed directly to increases in the strength of the westerlies. Instead, regional changes in atmospheric circulation and associated changes in sea surface temperature and sea ice are required to explain the enhanced warming in West Antarctica."
https://openalex.org/W2032668395,"The physiologic importance of GABAergic neurotransmission in hypothalamic neurocircuits is unknown. To examine the importance of GABA release from agouti-related protein (AgRP) neurons (which also release AgRP and neuropeptide Y), we generated mice with an AgRP neuron-specific deletion of vesicular GABA transporter. These mice are lean, resistant to obesity and have an attenuated hyperphagic response to ghrelin. Thus, GABA release from AgRP neurons is important in regulating energy balance."

https://openalex.org/W2109569847,"Animal studies have shown robust electrophysiological activity in the sensory cortex in the absence of stimuli or tasks. Similarly, recent human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) revealed widespread, spontaneously emerging cortical fluctuations. However, it is unknown what neuronal dynamics underlie this spontaneous activity in the human brain. Here we studied this issue by combining bilateral single-unit, local field potentials (LFPs) and intracranial electrocorticography (ECoG) recordings in individuals undergoing clinical monitoring. We found slow (<0.1 Hz, following 1/f-like profiles) spontaneous fluctuations of neuronal activity with significant interhemispheric correlations. These fluctuations were evident mainly in neuronal firing rates and in gamma (40-100 Hz) LFP power modulations. Notably, the interhemispheric correlations were enhanced during rapid eye movement and stage 2 sleep. Multiple intracranial ECoG recordings revealed clear selectivity for functional networks in the spontaneous gamma LFP power modulations. Our results point to slow spontaneous modulations in firing rate and gamma LFP as the likely correlates of spontaneous fMRI fluctuations in the human sensory cortex."

https://openalex.org/W2069820450,"Talins link integrins to the actin cytoskeleton and are important for cell spreading. Sheetz and colleagues show that talin is dispensable for initial cell spreading but it is required for sustained cell spreading and adhesion. Cell spreading, adhesion and remodelling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) involve bi-directional signalling and physical linkages between the ECM, integrins and the cell cytoskeleton1,2,3. The actin-binding proteins talin1 and 2 link ligand-bound integrins to the actin cytoskeleton and increase the affinity of integrin for the ECM4,5,6. Here we report that depletion of talin2 in talin1-null (talin1−/−) cells did not affect the initiation of matrix-activated spreading or Src family kinase (SFK) activation, but abolished the ECM–integrin–cytoskeleton linkage and sustained cell spreading and adhesion. Specifically, focal adhesion assembly, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signalling and traction force generation on substrates were severely affected. The talin1 head domain restored β1 integrin activation but only full-length talin1 restored the ECM–cytoskeleton linkage and normal cytoskeleton organization. Our results demonstrate three biochemically distinct steps in fibronectin-activated cell spreading and adhesion: 1) fibronectin–integrin binding and initiation of spreading, 2) fast cell spreading and 3) focal adhesion formation and substrate traction. We suggest that talin is not required for initial cell spreading. However, talin provides the important mechanical linkage between ligand-bound integrins and the actin cytoskeleton required to catalyse focal adhesion-dependent pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2148331740,"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of brain activity relies on the assumption that increases in local blood flow in the brain are directly correlated with the neuronal activity in that brain region. Using simultaneous direct recording and fMRI in monkeys, Yevgeniy Sirotin and Aniruddha Das demonstrate that this is not the whole story; part of the fMRI signal is unrelated to actual brain activity. As well as the brain activity component, there is increased blood flow in less active regions of the brain in anticipation of their employment in the near future. These findings challenge to the current interpretation of functional brain imaging signals, and also point to a novel anticipatory mechanism in the brain. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of brain activity relies on the assumption that increases in local blood flow in the brain are directly correlated with the neuronal activity in that brain region. Using simultaneous direct recording and fMRI in monkeys, this study demonstrates that this is not the whole story; some of the fMRI signal does correspond to actual brain activity, but there is also increased blood flow in less active regions of the brain in anticipation of their employment in the near future. Haemodynamic signals underlying functional brain imaging (for example, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)) are assumed to reflect metabolic demand generated by local neuronal activity, with equal increases in haemodynamic signal implying equal increases in the underlying neuronal activity1,2,3,4,5,6. Few studies have compared neuronal and haemodynamic signals in alert animals7,8 to test for this assumed correspondence. Here we present evidence that brings this assumption into question. Using a dual-wavelength optical imaging technique9 that independently measures cerebral blood volume and oxygenation, continuously, in alert behaving monkeys, we find two distinct components to the haemodynamic signal in the alert animals’ primary visual cortex (V1). One component is reliably predictable from neuronal responses generated by visual input. The other component—of almost comparable strength—is a hitherto unknown signal that entrains to task structure independently of visual input or of standard neural predictors of haemodynamics. This latter component shows predictive timing, with increases of cerebral blood volume in anticipation of trial onsets even in darkness. This trial-locked haemodynamic signal could be due to an accompanying V1 arterial pumping mechanism, closely matched in time, with peaks of arterial dilation entrained to predicted trial onsets. These findings (tested in two animals) challenge the current understanding of the link between brain haemodynamics and local neuronal activity. They also suggest the existence of a novel preparatory mechanism in the brain that brings additional arterial blood to cortex in anticipation of expected tasks."
https://openalex.org/W2100119722,"The efficiency of remyelination decreases with age, but the molecular mechanisms responsible for this decline remain only partially understood. In this study, we show that remyelination is regulated by age-dependent epigenetic control of gene expression. In demyelinated young brains, new myelin synthesis is preceded by downregulation of oligodendrocyte differentiation inhibitors and neural stem cell markers, and this is associated with recruitment of histone deacetylases (HDACs) to promoter regions. In demyelinated old brains, HDAC recruitment is inefficient, and this allows the accumulation of transcriptional inhibitors and prevents the subsequent surge in myelin gene expression. Defective remyelination can be recapitulated in vivo in mice receiving systemic administration of pharmacological HDAC inhibitors during cuprizone treatment and is consistent with in vitro results showing defective differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitors after silencing specific HDAC isoforms. Thus, we suggest that inefficient epigenetic modulation of the oligodendrocyte differentiation program contributes to the age-dependent decline in remyelination efficiency."

https://openalex.org/W1989826158,"Structural sexual dimorphism in the developing nervous system can lead to functional differences in physiology and behavior. Postnatal, gender-based differences in cell number were presumed to be passively maintained, but here, Ahmed et al. reveal an active mechanism modulated by sex hormones that maintains different numbers of cells in sexually dimorphic brain areas. New cells, including neurons, arise in several brain regions during puberty in rats. Sex differences in pubertal addition of cells coincide with adult sexual dimorphisms: for each region, the sex that gains more cells during puberty has a larger volume in adulthood. Removing gonadal hormones before puberty eliminates these sex differences, indicating that gonadal steroids direct the addition of new cells during puberty to maintain and accentuate sexual dimorphisms in the adult brain."
https://openalex.org/W1974298458,"The disease protein in frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive inclusions (FTLD-U) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) was identified recently as the TDP-43 (TAR DNA-binding protein 43), thereby providing a molecular link between these two disorders. In FTLD-U and ALS, TDP-43 is redistributed from its normal nuclear localization to form cytoplasmic insoluble aggregates. Moreover, pathological TDP-43 is abnormally ubiquitinated, hyperphosphorylated, and N-terminally cleaved to generate C-terminal fragments (CTFs). However, the specific cleavage site(s) and the biochemical properties as well as the functional consequences of pathological TDP-43 CTFs remained unknown. Here we have identified the specific cleavage site, Arg208, of a pathological TDP-43 CTF purified from FTLD-U brains and show that the expression of this and other TDP-43 CTFs in cultured cells recapitulates key features of TDP-43 proteinopathy. These include the formation of cytoplasmic aggregates that are ubiquitinated and abnormally phosphorylated at sites found in FTLD-U and ALS brain and spinal cord samples. Furthermore, we observed splicing abnormalities in a cell culture system expressing TDP-43 CTFs, and this is significant because the regulation of exon splicing is a known function of TDP-43.

It is a 414-amino acid nuclear protein with two highly conserved RNA recognition motifs (RRM1 and RRM2) and a C-terminal tail with a typical glycine-rich region that mediates protein-protein interactions, including interactions with other heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) family members such as hnRNP A1, A2/B1, and A3 (3Buratti E.

Thus, TDP-43 is a ubiquitously expressed RNA/DNA-binding protein that also interacts with other nuclear proteins such as splicing factors.

To mimic this nuclear clearance and to model the sequestration of endogenous TDP-43 into cytoplasmic aggregates, we overexpressed TDP-43 with mutated nuclear localization signals (ΔNLS-TDP-43) in cultured cells that showed a reduction in endogenous nuclear TDP-43 and accumulations of insoluble cytoplasmic aggregates (13Winton M.J.

Moreover, overexpression of TDP-43 with a mutated nuclear export signal (ΔNES-TDP-43) resulted in the formation of insoluble nuclear TDP-43 aggregates (13Winton M.J. Igaz L.M. Wong M.M. Kwong L.K.

Pathological TDP-43 is hyperphosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and abnormally cleaved so that C-terminal fragments (CTFs) of TDP-43 accumulate in cells of affected CNS areas (1Neumann M. Sampathu D.M.

Indeed, we recently showed that insoluble TDP-43 CTFs are selectively enriched in affected cortical regions compared with the spinal cord of both FTLD-U and ALS cases (14Igaz L.M. Kwong L.K. Xu Y.

These observations suggest that TDP-43 is differentially processed in brain versus spinal cord and that TDP-43 CTFs might seed inclusion formation and aggregation in cortical neurons. Because CTFs contain the TDP-43 glycine-rich region, the accumulation of CTF-rich aggregates may result in abnormal interactions with proteins involved in the splicing machinery of affected cells. However, little is known about how pathological TDP-43 is cleaved to generate TDP-43 CTFs or the biochemical properties of disease-related TDP-43 CTFs. Here we address these questions by identifying the cleavage site of an endogenous TDP-43 CTF purified from FTLD-U brains. We also model the aggregation of this and several other TDP-43 CTFs in the cytoplasm of cultured cells and show that expression of TDP-43 CTFs is sufficient to generate cytoplasmic aggregates. Moreover, these insoluble CTFs are ubiquitinated and abnormally phosphorylated at sites similar to those in human FTLD-U and ALS CNS samples. Finally, we demonstrate that cells expressing TDP-43 CTFs display abnormal splicing of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), which is relevant to TDP-43 function because alternative splicing of this gene is known to be regulated by TDP-43 (6Buratti E. Dork T. Zuccato E. Pagani F. Romano M. Baralle F.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1774-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Our results recapitulate unique features of pathological TDP-43 that are hallmarks of FTLD-U and ALS and implicate the generation of TDP-43 CTFs as a key event in the pathogenesis of TDP-43 proteinopathies.

Bound proteins and fragments were then eluted from the beads with SDS sample buffer without dithiothreitol (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 10% sucrose) at 80 °C to minimize the dissociation of IgG light chain from the bead complex. Eluted proteins were reduced with dithiothreitol at elevated temperature before resolution by 12% Bis-Tris NuPage® (Invitrogen) SDS-PAGE using MOPS buffer system and transferred to sequence grade polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). Typically, two gels were run: one for immunoblotting and the other for N-terminal sequencing. For N-terminal sequencing, the membrane was stained with 0.1% Amido Black, and protein bands that correspond to the TDP-43 immuno-positive bands (∼20–25 kDa) on the companion immunoblots were excised. Cleavage sites of TDP-43 fragments were determined by N-terminal automated Edman sequencing on an Applied Biosystems 494 protein sequencer at the Wistar Institute Proteomics Facility. At minimum, eight cycles of sequencing are conducted for amino acid sequence. Cell Culture and Transfection-QBI-293, Neuro2a, and COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 1% l-glutamate. The cells were transfected using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In some experiments, transfected cells were treated with 10 μm MG132 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 16 h. Immunofluorescence Studies-Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 (Sigma) in PBS for 10 min, blocked with 5% powdered milk in PBS for 2 h, and incubated overnight with primary antibody at 4 °C. Primary antibodies were visualized with secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 and Alexa Fluor 594 (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and the nuclei were detected using 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole. All of the cells were analyzed using a Nikon TE-2000-E (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan), and images were captured using a CoolSnap-HQ camera (Photometrics, Tuscon, AZ). All of the micrographs show images representative of the total cell population. For quantification of aggregates, several random fields/sample were analyzed, and the percentage of transfected cells that displayed TDP-43 positive accumulations was calculated. Solubility and Biochemical Analysis-To examine the solubility profile of TDP-43, sequential extractions were performed. The cells were washed twice with PBS, lysed in cold RIPA buffer containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 mg/ml pepstatin, leuptin, N-p-Tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, Nα-Tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone hydrochloride, trypsin inhibitor; Sigma), and a mixture of phosphatase inhibitors (2 mm imidazole, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate; Sigma). The cell lysates were sonicated and then cleared by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to generate the RIPA soluble samples. To prevent carry-overs, the resulting pellets were washed with RIPA buffer (i.e. resonicated and recentrifuged). Only the supernatants from the first centrifugation were analyzed. RIPA insoluble pellets were then extracted with urea buffer (7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 30 mm Tris, pH 8.5), sonicated, and centrifuged at 70,000 × g for 30 min at 22 °C. Protease and phosphatase inhibitors were added to all buffers prior to use (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and a mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors). Protein concentration was determined by bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce), and proteins were resolved by 10 or 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Following transfer, nitrocellulose membranes were blocked in 5% powdered milk and incubated in the primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. Primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Wegate, PA), and the blots were developed with Renaissance Enhanced Luminal Reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The digital images were acquired using a Fuji Film Intelligent Darkbox II (Fuji Systems, Stamford, CT). For quantification of TDP-43 CTFs insolubility, densitometric analysis of RIPA-soluble and insoluble fractions of at least three different experiments was performed using Image Quant 5.0 software (Molecular Dynamics Inc, Sunnyvale, CA). Where indicated, cell lysates or postmortem brain tissue from FTLD-U cases sequentially extracted as previously described (1Neumann M. Sampathu D.M. Kwong L.K. Truax A.C. Micsenyi M.C. Chou T.T.

Splicing Analysis-TDP-43 functional activity was assayed through evaluation of CFTR splicing. First, various TDP-43 constructs were transiently transfected into QBI-293 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) following standard manufacturer protocols. Forty-eight hours later, a hybrid minigene construct (a generous gift from Dr. F. Baralle, International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Trieste, Italy) designed to evaluate CFTR exon 9 splicing was transiently transfected into the same cells (6Buratti E. Dork T. Zuccato E. Pagani F. Romano M. Baralle F.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1774-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 17Pagani F. Buratti E. Stuani C. Romano M. Zuccato E. Niksic M. Giglio L.

Supplemental Fig. S3 depicts the structure of the minigene construct, which consists of CFTR exon 9 with portions of the CFTR flanking introns inserted between exons from a hybrid fibronectin-α-globin gene (18Muro A.F. Iaconcig A. Baralle F.E. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The relative exclusion of exon 9 in the presence of various TDP-43 constructs was then evaluated by primer extension from the flanking exons of exon 9. Total RNA was prepared from cells 72 h after transfection of TDP-43 constructs and 24 h after transfection of the TG(13)T(5) CFTR minigene reporter construct, and RT-PCR was performed using 3 μg of total RNA and 2 μl of the resulting cDNA as described previously (17Pagani F. Buratti E. Stuani C. Romano M. Zuccato E. Niksic M. Giglio L. Faraguna D. Baralle F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21041-21047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The primers used were: Bra2, TAGGATCCGGTCACCAGGAAGTTGGTTAAATCA; a2-3, CAACTTCAAGCTCCTAAGCCACTGC. PCR conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 10 min (hot start), followed by 30 cycles of denaturing at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 57 °C for 30 s, and elongation at 72 °C for 60 s. The PCR products were visualized on a 1.5% agarose gel; relative amounts of different splice products were quantified and visualized using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer on a DNA 1000 chip. The experiments were performed in duplicate and repeated at least three times. N-terminally Cleaved Sites of TDP-43 CTFs-Previously, we have shown that cortical TDP-43 inclusions in FTLD-U and ALS brains are composed predominantly of CTFs (14Igaz L.M. Kwong L.K. Xu Y. Truax A.C. Uryu K. Neumann M. Clark C.M. Elman L.B. Miller B.L. Grossman M. McCluskey L.F. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Am. J. Pathol. 2008; 173: 182-194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). To better understand the biological significance of the CTFs, we determined their cleavage sites by N-terminal sequencing. Cortical urea extracts of FTLD-U brains containing high levels of CTFs were immunoprecipitated with anti-TDP-43 mAb, and the resultant proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE gels and immunoblotted with a pAb raised to the extreme C terminus (C-t) of TDP-43. Two protein bands with apparent molecular masses of ∼24 and ∼22 kDa were recognized by the anti-C-t TDP-43 pAb (Fig. 1A). The same bands were identified on Amido Black-stained duplicate polyvinylidene difluoride blots and were excised for N-terminal sequencing (Fig. 1A, arrows). Results from the ∼22-kDa band gave a primary sequence beginning at Arg208 in TDP-43 (Fig. 1A, arrow with asterisk), but no sequence was obtained from the ∼24-kDa band. Similar results were obtained from four separate experiments using two different FTLD-U cases. The identification of the N terminus of a CTF together with our previous liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry studies on TDP-43 CTFs showing the presence of residues at the extreme C terminus (1Neumann M. Sampathu D.M. Kwong L.K. Truax A.C. Micsenyi M.C. Chou T.T. Bruce J. Schuck T. Grossman M. Clark C.M. McCluskey L.F. Miller B.L. Masliah E. Mackenzie I.R. Feldman H. Feiden W. Kretzschmar H.A. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.Y. Science. 2006; 314: 130-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (4417) Google Scholar) allow us to conclude that we have identified a pathological TDP-43 fragment spanning amino acid residues 208–414 (designated as 208 TDP-43). To study the biochemical properties of TDP-43 CTFs and to determine whether the expression of these fragments recapitulated pathological features of authentic CTFs isolated from FTLD-U and ALS brains, we developed a series of vectors for expression in cultured cells. Plasmids containing the 208 TDP-43 CTF as well as slightly longer CTFs containing residues 177–414, 187–414, or 197–414 of TDP-43 (designated as 177 TDP-43, 187 TDP-43, and 197 TDP-43, respectively) were generated (Fig. 1B). Each TDP-43 CTF cDNA was expressed in QBI-293 cells, a human embryonic kidney cell line, as well as N2a, a mouse neuroblastoma cell line, and the electrophoretic mobility of the fragments migrated between 20 and 25 kDa (Fig. 1C). TDP-43 CTFs Expressed in Cultured Cells Are Insoluble and Hyperphosphorylated-Previous studies have shown that TDP-43 CTFs isolated from FTLD-U and ALS brains are insoluble and hyperphosphorylated (1Neumann M. Sampathu D.M. Kwong L.K. Truax A.C. Micsenyi M.C. Chou T.T. Bruce J. Schuck T. Grossman M. Clark C.M. McCluskey L.F. Miller B.L. Masliah E. Mackenzie I.R. Feldman H. Feiden W. Kretzschmar H.A. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.Y. Science. 2006; 314: 130-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (4417) Google Scholar). To determine whether these pathological properties can be recapitulated in cultured cells, we expressed all four TDP-43 CTFs constructs (i.e. 177 TDP-43, 187 TDP-43, 197 TDP-43, and 208 TDP-43) in N2a (Fig. 2) and QBI-293 (supplemental Fig. S1) cells. Sequential extraction of cells overexpressing each of the four CTFs with RIPA and urea buffers showed a progressive increase in the degree of RIPA insolubility going from the largest to the smallest CTF with 177 TDP-43 CTFs being the most soluble and 197 and 208 TDP-43 CTFs being the most insoluble (Fig. 2, A and B, and supplemental Fig. S1). Quantitative immunoblotting showed that almost 100% of the two smaller TDP-43 CTFs are insoluble in RIPA and can only be extracted by urea (Fig. 2B). However, expression of TDP-43 CTFs tagged with the Myc epitope in QBI-293 cells (supplemental Fig. S2) increased their solubility when compared with their untagged counterparts (compare supplemental Figs. S1 and S2). We also detected multiple immunobands (particularly those recovered in the urea fractions) upon expression of TDP-43 CTFs in cultured cells (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. S1). Because pathological TDP-43 CTFs recovered from FTLD-U and ALS brains are hyperphosphorylated at multiple sites including hyperphosphorylation at Ser409 and Ser410 (p409/410), we asked whether the CTFs expressed in transfected cells are also hyperphosphorylated (19Hasegawa M. Arai T. Nonaka T. Kametani F. Yoshida M. Hashizume Y. Beach T.G. Buratti E. Baralle F. Morita M. Nakano I. Oda T. Tsuchiya K. Akiyama H. Ann. Neurol. 2008; 64: 60-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Using a rat mAb specific for p409/410 (16Neumann M. Kwong L.K. Lee E.B. Kremmer E. Flatley A. Xu Y. Forman M.S. Troost D. Kretzschmar H.A. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Acta Neuropathol. 2009; 117: 137-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), we found that all four TDP-43 CTFs displayed robust phospho-specific signals and that labeled phospho-immunobands showed slower apparent electrophoretic mobility than the main protein band recognized by the anti-C-t TDP-43 pAb (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. S1, red asterisks highlight the same immunobands detected by C-t TDP-43 and p409/410 antibodies, and the black asterisk identifies the main protein band recognized only by the anti-C-t TDP-43 pAb). Significantly, although the electrophoretic mobility of nonphosphorylated 208 TDP-43 CTFs was close to 20 kDa, the phosphorylated counterpart migrated at ∼22 kDa. Moreover, phosphorylated TDP-43 CTFs were detected only in the urea fraction, and phosphorylation at Ser409 and Ser410 was not seen in endogenous TDP-43 recovered from RIPA extractions (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. S1). Thus, like pathological TDP-43 CTFs recovered from diseased brains, TDP-43 CTFs in our in vitro models are phosphorylated, and the phosphorylated TDP-43 CTFs are insoluble. To characterize the morphology of these phosphorylated, insoluble TDP-43 CTFs, we conducted double label immunofluorescence analysis of transfected cells using anti-C-t TDP-43 pAb and the rat anti-p409/410 mAb. Phosphorylated Ser409/Ser410 was detected within C-t TDP-43-positive aggregates when each of the four TDP-43 CTFs was expressed (Fig. 2C and supplemental Fig. S1). Phosphorylated endogenous nuclear TDP-43 was not seen in control or untransfected cells, and the foci of aggregated phosphorylated TDP-43 CTFs were observed within diffuse cytoplasmic TDP-43 immunoreactivity when longer, more soluble CTFs (e.g. 177 TDP-43) were expressed (Fig. 2C and supplemental Fig. S1). Occasionally, we observed CTFs in the nucleus, and we attribute this to the overexpression and small size of the CTFs. Finally, we also observed a direct correlation bet"
https://openalex.org/W2129084135,"The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signal transduction pathways have critical roles in the consolidation of hippocampus-dependent memory. We found that extracellular regulated kinase 1/2 MAPK phosphorylation and cAMP underwent a circadian oscillation in the hippocampus that was paralleled by changes in Ras activity and the phosphorylation of MAPK kinase and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). The nadir of this activation cycle corresponded with severe deficits in hippocampus-dependent fear conditioning under both light-dark and free-running conditions. Circadian oscillations in cAMP and MAPK activity were absent in memory-deficient transgenic mice that lacked Ca2+ -stimulated adenylyl cyclases. Furthermore, physiological and pharmacological interference with oscillations in MAPK phosphorylation after the cellular memory consolidation period impaired the persistence of hippocampus-dependent memory. These data suggest that the persistence of long-term memories may depend on reactivation of the cAMP/MAPK/CREB transcriptional pathway in the hippocampus during the circadian cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2057231921,"The kinase Plk1 regulates multiple processes during mitosis in mammalian cells. Chen and colleagues show that Plk1 also controls a transcriptional network required for orderly cell-cycle progression through Cdk1-dependent phosphorylation of the transcription factor FoxM1 Proper control of entry into and progression through mitosis is essential for normal cell proliferation and the maintenance of genome stability1,2,3,4. The mammalian mitotic kinase Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is involved in multiple stages of mitosis5. Here we report that Forkhead Box M1 (FoxM1), a substrate of Plk1 (refs 6, 7, 8), controls a transcriptional programme that mediates Plk1-dependent regulation of cell-cycle progression. The carboxy-terminal domain of FoxM1 binds Plk1, and phosphorylation of two key residues in this domain by Cdk1 is essential for Plk1–FoxM1 interaction. Formation of the Plk1–FoxM1 complex allows for direct phosphorylation of FoxM1 by Plk1 at G2/M and the subsequent activation of FoxM1 activity, which is required for expression of key mitotic regulators, including Plk1 itself. Thus, Plk1-dependent regulation of FoxM1 activity provides a positive-feedback loop ensuring tight regulation of transcriptional networks essential for orderly mitotic progression."

https://openalex.org/W2070154168,"Ambient light can acutely modulate sleep and can be detected by the retina independently of photoreceptors. A new study from Foster and colleagues shows that photosensitive retinal ganglion cells, with their activation of sleep-promoting centers, mediate this irradiance-dependent sleep induction. Sleep is regulated by both homeostatic and circadian mechanisms. The latter, termed 'process c', helps synchronize sleep-wake patterns to the appropriate time of the day. However, in the absence of a circadian clock, overall sleep-wake rhythmicity is preserved and remains synchronized to the external light-dark cycle, indicating that there is an additional, clock-independent photic input to sleep. We found that the direct photic regulation of sleep in mice is predominantly mediated by melanopsin (OPN4)-based photoreception of photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (pRGCs). Moreover, OPN4-dependent sleep regulation was correlated with the activation of sleep-promoting neurons in the ventrolateral preoptic area and the superior colliculus. Collectively, our findings describe a previously unknown pathway in sleep regulation and identify the pRGC/OPN4 signaling system as a potentially new pharmacological target for the selective manipulation of sleep and arousal states."

The biochemical hallmarks of the disease include low activity of the iron sulfur cluster-containing proteins (ISP) and impairment of antioxidant defense mechanisms that may play a major role in disease progression. Methodology/Principal Findings We thus investigated signaling pathways involved in antioxidant defense mechanisms. We showed that cultured fibroblasts from patients with Friedreich ataxia exhibited hypersensitivity to oxidative insults because of an impairment in the Nrf2 signaling pathway, which led to faulty induction of antioxidant enzymes. This impairment originated from previously reported actin remodeling by hydrogen peroxide. Conclusions/Significance Thus, the defective machinery for ISP synthesis by causing mitochondrial iron dysmetabolism increases hydrogen peroxide production that accounts for the increased susceptibility to oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2091994158,"Although certain ion channels can be gated by temperature, it is currently unknown how this occurs. Here, the authors identify regions of TRPV3 that are critical for heat sensation, yet independent of other channel gating mechanisms. Ion channels can be activated (gated) by a variety of stimuli, including chemicals, voltage, mechanical force or temperature. Although molecular mechanisms of ion channel gating by chemical and voltage stimuli are understood in principal, the mechanisms of temperature activation remain unknown. The transient receptor potential channel TRPV3 is a nonselective cation channel that is activated by warm temperatures and sensory chemicals such as camphor. Here we screened ∼14,000 random mutant clones of mouse TRPV3 and identified five single point mutations that specifically abolish heat activation but do not perturb chemical activation or voltage modulation. Notably, all five mutations are located in the putative sixth transmembrane helix and the adjacent extracellular loop in the pore region of mouse TRPV3. Although distinct in sequence, we found that the corresponding loop of frog TRPV3 is also specifically required for heat activation. These findings demonstrate that the temperature sensitivity of TRPV3 is separable from all other known activation mechanisms and implicate a specific region in temperature sensing."
https://openalex.org/W1982899653,"Cellular progression through mitosis is largely controlled by the APC-Cdh1 complex. Zhang and colleagues report that, when the Cdh1 gene is disrupted, cells undergo premature p16-dependent senescence, and that Cdh1-deficient mice show impairment of hippocampus-dependent learning and memory. The anaphase promoting complex (APC) or cyclosome is a multi-subunit E3 ubiquitin ligase. Cdc20 (fizzy (fzy)) or p55CDC, and Cdh1 (Hct1, srw1 or fizzy-related 1 (fzr1)) encode two adaptor proteins that bring substrates to the APC. Both APC–Cdc20 and APC–Cdh1 have been implicated in the control of mitosis through mediating ubiquitination of mitotic regulators, such as cyclin B1 and securin. However, the importance of Cdh1 function in vivo and whether its function is redundant with that of Cdc20 are unclear. Here we have analysed mice lacking Cdh1. We show that Cdh1 is essential for placental development and that its deficiency causes early lethality. Cdh1-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) entered replicative senescence prematurely because of stabilization of Ets2 and subsequent activation of p16Ink4a expression. These results have uncovered an unexpected role of the APC in maintaining replicative lifespan of MEFs. Further, Cdh1 heterozygous mice show defects in late-phase long-term potentiation (L-LTP) in the hippocampus and are deficient in contextual fear-conditioning, suggesting that Cdh1 has a role in learning and memory."

https://openalex.org/W2059437215,"The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is cleaved to produce the Alzheimer disease-associated peptide Abeta, but the normal functions of uncleaved APP in the brain are unknown. We found that APP was present in the postsynaptic density of central excitatory synapses and coimmunoprecipitated with N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). The presence of APP in the postsynaptic density was supported by the observation that NMDARs regulated trafficking and processing of APP; overexpression of the NR1 subunit increased surface levels of APP, whereas activation of NMDARs decreased surface APP and promoted production of Abeta. We transfected APP or APP RNA interference into primary neurons and used electrophysiological techniques to explore the effects of APP on postsynaptic function. Reduction of APP decreased (and overexpression of APP increased) NMDAR whole cell current density and peak amplitude of spontaneous miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents. The increase in NMDAR current by APP was due to specific recruitment of additional NR2B-containing receptors. Consistent with these findings, immunohistochemical experiments demonstrated that APP increased the surface levels and decreased internalization of NR2B subunits. These results demonstrate a novel physiological role of postsynaptic APP in enhancing NMDAR function."
https://openalex.org/W2012743472,"Combined bezafibrate (BEZ) and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) exert unexpected antileukaemic activities against acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and these activities are associated with the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within the tumor cells. Although the generation of ROS by these drugs is supported by preceding studies including our own, the interrelationship between the cellular effects of the drugs and ROS generation is not well understood. Here we report the use of NMR metabolomic profiling to further study the effect of BEZ and MPA on three AML cell lines and to shed light on the underlying mechanism of action. For this we focused on drug effects induced during the initial 24 hours of treatment prior to the onset of overt cellular responses and examined these in the context of basal differences in metabolic profiles between the cell lines. Despite their ultimately profound cellular effects, the early changes in metabolic profiles engendered by these drugs were less pronounced than the constitutive metabolic differences between cell types. Nonetheless, drug treatments engendered common metabolic changes, most markedly in the response to the combination of BEZ and MPA. These responses included changes to TCA cycle intermediates consistent with recently identified chemical actions of ROS. Notable amongst these was the conversion of alpha-ketoglutarate to succinate which was recapitulated by the treatment of cell extracts with exogenous hydrogen peroxide. These findings indicate that the actions of combined BEZ and MPA against AML cells are indeed mediated downstream of the generation of ROS rather than some hitherto unsuspected mechanism. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that metabolite profiles represent highly sensitive markers for genomic differences between cells and their responses to external stimuli. This opens new perspectives to use metabolic profiling as a tool to study the rational redeployment of drugs in new disease settings."
https://openalex.org/W2019143604,"The central serotonergic system is an important modulator of neural circuitry that regulates behavior and emotion state of an animal. Current study from Lerch-Haner et al. shows that mutant female mice with defective serotonergic neurons exhibit gross maternal neglect resulting in offspring death, and that this defect can be rescued by expression of a homologous gene from human. Central serotonergic signaling influences many physiological processes, but a requirement for reproductive success has not been demonstrated. Using mouse dams with a specific disruption in serotonin neuron development, we found that serotonergic function is required for the nurturing and survival of offspring. Full rescue of survival depended on the mother's expression level of the upstream serotonergic transcriptional cascade. Thus, intrinsic transcriptional programming of maternal serotonergic activity determines the quality of nurturing and whether or not the organism survives."

https://openalex.org/W2085237813,"Ageing is associated with mitochondrial degeneration. In yeast, reducing cytosolic protein synthesis suppresses age-dependent mitochondrial dysfunction and extends lifespan. Mitochondrial function degenerates with ageing and in ageing-related neuromuscular degenerative diseases, causing physiological decline of the cell1. Factors that can delay the degenerative process are actively sought after. Here, we show that reduced cytosolic protein synthesis is a robust cellular strategy that suppresses ageing-related mitochondrial degeneration. We modelled autosomal dominant progressive external ophthalmoplegia (adPEO), an adult- or later-onset degenerative disease, by introducing the A128P mutation into the adenine nucleotide translocase Aac2p of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The aac2A128P allele dominantly induces ageing-dependent mitochondrial degeneration and phenotypically tractable degenerative cell death, independently of its ADP/ATP exchange activity. Mitochondrial degeneration was suppressed by lifespan-extending nutritional interventions and by eight longevity mutations, which are all known to reduce cytosolic protein synthesis. These longevity interventions also independently suppressed ageing-related mitochondrial degeneration in the pro-ageing prohibitin mutants. The aac2A128P mutant has reduced mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) and is synthetically lethal to low Δψm conditions, including the loss of prohibitin. Mitochondrial degeneration was accelerated by defects in protein turnover on the inner membrane and was suppressed by cycloheximide, a specific inhibitor of cytosolic ribosomes. Reduced cytosolic protein synthesis suppressed membrane depolarization and defects in mitochondrial gene expression in aac2A128P cells. Our finding thus establishes a link between protein homeostasis (proteostasis), cellular bioenergetics and mitochondrial maintenance during ageing."
https://openalex.org/W2151854814,"The sleep disorder narcolepsy is caused by a vast reduction in neurons producing the hypocretin (orexin) neuropeptides. Based on the tight association with HLA, narcolepsy is believed to result from an autoimmune attack, but the cause of hypocretin cell loss is still unknown. We performed gene expression profiling in the hypothalamus to identify novel genes dysregulated in narcolepsy, as these may be the target of autoimmune attack or modulate hypocretin gene expression.We used microarrays to compare the transcriptome in the posterior hypothalamus of (1) narcoleptic versus control postmortem human brains and (2) transgenic mice lacking hypocretin neurons versus wild type mice. Hypocretin was the most downregulated gene in human narcolepsy brains. Among many additional candidates, only one, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP3), was downregulated in both human and mouse models and co-expressed in hypocretin neurons. Functional analysis indicated decreased hypocretin messenger RNA and peptide content, and increased sleep in transgenic mice overexpressing human IGFBP3, an effect possibly mediated through decreased hypocretin promotor activity in the presence of excessive IGFBP3. Although we found no IGFBP3 autoantibodies nor a genetic association with IGFBP3 polymorphisms in human narcolepsy, we found that an IGFBP3 polymorphism known to increase serum IGFBP3 levels was associated with lower CSF hypocretin-1 in normal individuals.Comparison of the transcriptome in narcolepsy and narcolepsy model mouse brains revealed a novel dysregulated gene which colocalized in hypocretin cells. Functional analysis indicated that the identified IGFBP3 is a new regulator of hypocretin cell physiology that may be involved not only in the pathophysiology of narcolepsy, but also in the regulation of sleep in normal individuals, most notably during adolescence. Further studies are required to address the hypothesis that excessive IGFBP3 expression may initiate hypocretin cell death and cause narcolepsy."

Using an adenoviral-S100A7 expression system, we continued to examine the potential role of S100A7 in AD amyloid neuropathology in in vitro model of AD. We found that the expression of exogenous S100A7 in primary cortico-hippocampal neuron cultures derived from Tg2576 transgenic embryos inhibits the generation of β-amyloid (Aβ)1–42 and Aβ1–40 peptides, coincidental with a selective promotion of “non- amyloidogenic” α-secretase activity via promotion of ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase)-10. Finally, a selective expression of human S100A7 in the brain of transgenic mice results in significant promotion of α-secretase activity. Our study for the first time suggests that S100A7 may be a novel biomarker of AD dementia and supports the hypothesis that promotion of S100A7 expression in the brain may selectively promote α-secretase activity in the brain of AD precluding the generation of amyloidogenic peptides. If in the future we find that S1000A7 protein content in CSF is sensitive to drug intervention experimentally and eventually in the clinical setting, S100A7 might be developed as novel surrogate index (biomarker) of therapeutic efficacy in the characterization of novel drug agents for the treatment of AD."
https://openalex.org/W2037643648,"Viruses use various mechanisms to hijack cellular processes. Zhou and colleagues now describe a viral histone H3K27 methylase that modifies host histones and represses host target genes. Viruses recruit host proteins to secure viral genome maintenance and replication. However, whether they modify host histones directly to interfere with chromatin-based transcription is unknown. Here we report that Paramecium bursaria chlorella virus 1 (PBCV-1) encodes a functional SET domain histone Lys methyltransferase (HKMTase) termed vSET, which is linked to rapid inhibition of host transcription after viral infection. We show that vSET is packaged in the PBCV-1 virion, and that it contains a nuclear localization signal and probably represses host transcription by methylating histone H3 at Lys 27 (H3K27), a modification known to trigger gene silencing in eukaryotes. We also show that vSET induces cell accumulation at the G2/M phase by recruiting the Polycomb repressive complex CBX8 to the methylated H3K27 site in a heterologous system. vSET-like proteins that have H3K27 methylation activity are conserved in chlorella viruses. Our findings suggest a viral mechanism to repress gene transcription by direct modification of chromatin by PBCV-1 vSET."
https://openalex.org/W1993332722,"Background Breast cancer is a common malignant disease, which may be caused by a number of genes deregulated by genomic or epigenomic events. Deregulated WNT/β-catenin signaling with accumulation of β-catenin is common in breast tumors, but mutations in WNT signaling pathway components have been rare. An aberrantly spliced internally truncated LRP5 receptor (LRP5Δ666–809, LRP5Δ) was shown recently to be resistant to DKK1 inhibition, and was required for β-catenin accumulation in hyperparathyroid tumors and parathyroid tumor growth. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we show, by reverse transcription PCR and Western blot analysis, that LRP5Δ is frequently expressed in breast tumors of different cancer stage (58–100%), including carcinoma in situ and metastatic carcinoma. LRP5Δ was required in MCF7 breast cancer cells for the non-phosphorylated active β-catenin level, transcription activity of β-catenin, cell growth in vitro, and breast tumor growth in a xenograft SCID mouse model. WNT3 ligand, but not WNT1 and WNT3A augmented the endogenous β-catenin activity of MCF7 cells in a DKK1-insensitive manner. Furthermore, an anti-LRP5 antibody attenuated β-catenin activity, inhibited cell growth, and induced apoptosis in LRP5Δ-positive MCF7 and T-47D breast cancer cells, but not in control cells. Conclusions/Significance Our results suggest that the LRP5Δ receptor is strongly implicated in mammary gland tumorigenesis and that its aberrant expression present an early event during disease progression. LRP5 antibody therapy may have a significant role in the treatment of breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2159352516,"Ezrin, encoded by VIL2, is a membrane-cytoskeletal linker protein that has been suggested to be involved in tumorigenesis. Ezrin expression in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) was described recently, but its clinical significance and the molecular mechanism underlying its regulated expression remain unclear. Thus, we retrospectively evaluated ezrin expression by immunohistochemistry in a tissue microarray representing 193 ESCCs. Ezrin overexpression in 90 of 193 tumors (46.6%) was associated with poor survival (p = 0.048). We then explored the mechanism by which ezrin expression is controlled in ESCC by assessing the transcriptional regulatory regions of human VIL2 by fusing deletions or site-directed mutants of the 5′-flanking region of the gene to a luciferase reporter. We found that the region -87/-32 containing consensus Sp1 (-75/-69) and AP-1 (-64/-58) binding sites is crucial for VIL2 promoter activity in esophageal carcinoma cells (EC109) derived from ESCC. AP-1 is comprised of c-Jun and c-Fos. Electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that Sp1 and c-Jun bound specifically to their respective binding sites within the VIL2 promoter. In addition, transient expression of Sp1, c-Jun, or c-Fos increased ezrin expression and VIL2 promoter activity. Use of selective inhibitors revealed that VIL2 transactivation required the MEK1/2 signal transduction pathway but not JNK or p38 MAPK. Taken together, we propose a possible signal transduction pathway whereby MEK1/2 phosphorylates ERK1/2, which phosphorylates Sp1 and AP-1 that in turn bind to their respective binding sites to regulate the expression of human VIL2 in ESCC cells.

Ezrin (villin 2), encoded by VIL2, is a membrane-cytoskeleton linker protein belonging to the ezrin-radixin-moesin family (1Algrain M. Turunen O. Vaheri A. Louvard D. Arpin M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 129-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). By linking the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane to the actin cytoskeleton, ezrin acts as both a structural scaffold and a platform for the transmission of signals in response to extracellular cues (2Srivastava J. Elliott B.E. Louvard D. Arpin M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1481-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Ezrin is involved in a wide variety of cellular processes such as adhesion (3Hiscox S. Jiang W.G. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3081-3090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), survival (4Gautreau A. Poullet P.

Furthermore, recent biochemical and functional data have identified a novel role for ezrin in the control of cyclin A gene transcription and endothelial cell proliferation (9Kishore R. Qin G. Luedemann C. Bord E. Hanley A. Silver M. Gavin M. Goukassain D. Losordo D.W. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 1785-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).Ezrin is often aberrantly expressed in human cancers. There is a relationship between high expression of ezrin and metastatic potential of some carcinomas, including hepatocellular carcinoma (10Zhang Y. Hu M.Y. Wu W.Z. Wang Z.J. Zhou K. Zha X.L.

Cancer Lett. 2002; 179: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We also have demonstrated that ezrin is overexpressed in a malignantly transformed esophageal epithelial cell line compared with an immortalized cell line (15Shen Z.Y. Xu L.Y. Chen M.H. Li E.M.

Xu L. Xiao D. Zhang H. Wu X. Zheng R. Li Q. Niu Y. Shen Z. Li E. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2006; 54: 889-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Moreover, both in vivo and in vitro experiments suggest that ezrin may affect tumor formation and tumor invasiveness directly (17Xie J.J. Xu L.Y. Xie Y.M. Zhang H.H. Cai W.J. Zhou F. Shen Z.Y. Li E.M. Int. J. Cancer. 2009; (in press)Google Scholar). These findings of ezrin up-regulation associated with epithelial tumor metastasis and invasion make ezrin a potentially new prognostic marker and/or therapeutic target for some carcinomas (12Elliott B.E. Meens J.A. SenGupta S.K. Louvard D. Arpin M. Breast Cancer Res. 2005; 7: R365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 18Yeh T.S. Tseng J.H. Liu N.J. Chen T.C. Jan Y.Y. Chen M.F. Arch.

Pathol. 2006; 19: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).Although much is known about how ezrin functions, there have been few reports about how ezrin expression is regulated. It has been reported that human ezrin expression can be regulated by cytokines, interleukin 2 (IL-2), IL-8, IL-10, and insulin-like growth factor 1 inhibit ezrin expression in human colon cancer cells, whereas epidermal growth factor and IL-11 increase cellular ezrin levels (20Jiang W.G. Hiscox S. Anticancer Res. 1996; 16: 861-865PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, tumor necrosis factor-α treatment of human endothelial cells elevates ezrin expression (9Kishore R. Qin G. Luedemann C. Bord E. Hanley A. Silver M. Gavin M. Goukassain D. Losordo D.W. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 1785-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In disseminated osteosarcoma, ezrin is strongly stained by immunohistochemistry and has been proposed as a crucial factor for osteosarcoma metastasis (21Khanna C. Wan X. Bose S. Cassaday R. Olomu O. Mendoza A. Yeung C. Gorlick R. Hewitt S.M. Helman L.J. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Ogino et al. (22Ogino W. Takeshima Y. Mori T. Yanai T. Hayakawa A. Akisue T. Kurosaka M. Matsuo M. J. Pediatr. Hematol. Oncol. 2007; 29: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) demonstrated a high level of ezrin mRNA expression in an osteosarcoma biopsy sample with lung metastasis, which was compatible with previous reports analyzing ezrin protein levels (21Khanna C. Wan X. Bose S. Cassaday R. Olomu O. Mendoza A. Yeung C. Gorlick R. Hewitt S.M. Helman L.J. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). These data suggest that ezrin levels are controlled at the transcriptional level. Stable transformation of Rat-1 fibroblasts by Fos results in increased expression of ezrin (23Jooss K.U. Muller R. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 603-608PubMed Google Scholar, 24Lamb R.F. Ozanne B.W. Roy C. McGarry L. Stipp C. Mangeat P. Jay D.G. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 682-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Mouse ezrin expression correlates with Six1 expression in rhabdomyosarcoma (25Yu Y. Khan J. Khanna C. Helman L. Meltzer P.S. Merlino G. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Six1, a homeodomain-containing transcription factor required for skeletal muscle development, can bind to the mouse Vil2 promoter between -1106 and -870, a region containing the MEF3-like motif TTCAGGA, and regulate ezrin expression (26Yu Y. Davicioni E. Triche T.J. Merlino G. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 1982-1989Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment showed that the 5′-flanking regions of human VIL2 and mouse Vil2 are highly diverged (supplemental Fig. S1). Also the MEF3-like motif TTCAGGA present in the mouse sequence does not exist in the human VIL2 promoter. These sequence differences imply that the transcriptional regulation mechanism probably differs between human VIL2 and mouse Vil2. However, no study has addressed the transcriptional regulation of human VIL2, the key transcriptional regulatory regions of the gene, or the regulatory mechanisms governing its expression.In the present study, we evaluated the clinical significance of ezrin overexpression in ESCCs and explored the importance of DNA sequence elements, transcription factors, and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction pathway in regulating ezrin expression in human esophageal carcinoma cells (EC109 cells), which are derived from ESCC (27Pan Q.G. Xue X.H. Zhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zhi. 1980; 2: 187-192PubMed Google Scholar). We found that ezrin overexpression in ESCCs was associated with decreased survival and that consensus transcription factor Sp1 (-75/-69) and AP-1 (-64/-58) binding sites are essential for human VIL2 promoter activity. We further demonstrated that the cooperativity of Sp1 and AP-1 (c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimer) regulate VIL2 promoter activity and ezrin expression and that mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK1/2) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) are upstream kinases that control human VIL2 transcriptional activation in ESCC cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials-Expression plasmid CMV-Sp1 was kindly provided by Dr. Guntram Suske (Philips University, Marburg, Germany). Plasmid pcDNA3 was purchased from Invitrogen. Plasmids pGL3-Basic and pRL-TK, recombinant human (rh) proteins rhSp1 and rhAP-1 (c-Jun), and kinase inhibitors U0126, PD98059, and SB203580 were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor II SP600125 was purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Antibodies against Sp1, c-Jun, c-Fos, phospho-ERK1/2, ERK1/2, and ezrin, were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). β-Actin was purchased from Sigma. All other reagents were of analytical grade.Tissue Specimens and Immunohistochemical Staining-Surgically removed tumors embedded in paraffin wax blocks from 193 ESCC cases were retrieved from the archives of the Department of Pathology of the Central Hospital of Shantou City, China. The cases were received between 1987 and 1997. The cases were selected to build tissue microarrays as described (28Zhang F.R. Tao L.H. Shen Z.Y. Lv Z. Xu L.Y. Li. E.M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2008; 56: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and were included in this study only if a follow-up was obtained and clinical data were available. Mean age at surgery was 53 years (range 35-70), and 127 patients were male and 66 were female. The SuperPicTure Polymer Detection kit and Liquid Substrate kit (Invitrogen) were used to conduct immunohistochemistry according to the manufacturer's instructions. Staining was scored using the following scale: 0, no staining; 1+, minimal staining; 2+, moderate staining in at least 20% of cells; 3+, strong staining in at least 50% of cells. Cases scored as 0, 1+, or 2+ were classified as “non-overexpression,” and cases with 3+ staining were classified as “overexpression.” The study was approved by the ethical committee of the Central Hospital of Shantou City and the Medical College of Shantou University, and written informed consent was obtained from all surgical patients to use resected samples for research.Expression Vectors and Reporter Gene Constructs-The human VIL2 5′-flanking region plus 134 bp of transcribed human VIL2 sequence was generated by PCR using the following primers: Fezr, 5′-CGGGGTACCA-1759GTGAATGCTGTTGCTGCTCGTCTGGAAG-3′ (KpnI site underlined; position -1759 is indicated); Rezr, 5′-CCCAAGCT+134TTCGGTTTCTGGTGAGTATCCTCGATCCC-3′ (HindIII site underlined; translation initiation site for the ezrin protein occurs at +135). The amplified fragment from the genomic DNA of EC109 cells was digested with KpnI/HindIII and inserted into the KpnI/HindIII sites of pGL3-basic, and the resulting plasmid was named pGLB-hE(-1759/+134). The luciferase reporter plasmids, pGLB-hE(-324/+134), pGLB-hE(-890/+134), pGLB-hE(-696/+134), pGLB-hE(-213/+134), pGLB-hE(-146/+134), pGLB-hE(-97/+134), pGLB-hE(-87/+134), and pGLB-hE(-32/+134) were generated from pGLB-hE(-1759/+134) using the Erase-a-Base® System (Promega). Site-directed mutagenesis to obtain sequences (-87/+134)Sm, (-87/+134)Am, and (-87/+134)SAm was performed by PCR using primer “Rezr” along with the following primers: Fezr-Sm, 5′--83GCAGTGCTAATATTTGCGCTGACTCACCCGGGCCCG-3′; Fezr-Am, 5′--83GCAGTGCTGGGCGGGGCGCGTCGGATCCCGGGCCCGGGCTGGCCGGTTC-3′; or Fezr-SAm, 5′--83GCAGTGCTAATATTTGCGCGTCGGATCCCGGGCCCGGGCTGGCCGG-3′ (position -83 is indicated; mutated bases are underlined). The amplified fragments obtained using Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega) were digested with HindIII and inserted into the SmaI/HindIII sites of pGL3-basic and were named pGLB-hE(-87/+134)Sm, pGLB-hE(-87/+134)Am, and pGLB-hE(-87/+134)SAm; in the constructs the sequence upstream of the sense primer was GCCC, which is the same sequence as -87/-84 of the human VIL2 5′-flanking region. The c-Fos and c-Jun expression vectors were constructed by cloning full-length c-Fos or c-Jun cDNA in the pcDNA3 plasmid. Primers for c-Fos were 5′-CCAAGCTTACCGCCACGATGATGTTCTC-3′ (HindIII site underlined) and 5′-CGGGATCCTTCCCTGCCCCCTCACA-3′ (BamHI site underlined). Primers for c-Jun were 5′-CCAAGCTTTGACGGACTGTTCTATGACTGC-3′ (HindIII site underlined) and 5′-CGGGATCCCGACGGTCTCTCTTCAAAATGT-3′ (BamHI site underlined).Cell Culture and Transfection-EC109 cells were maintained in 199 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 environment. For transfection, cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 1.5 × 105 cells/ml, grown to 50-80% confluency and transfected with the plasmids described above using Superfect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Following transfection, cells were incubated for another 48 h before being harvested for the luciferase assay or gene expression assay. Alternatively, after transfection for 24 h, cells were treated with a kinase inhibitor for another 24 h before being harvested.Luciferase Assay-Transfected cells were harvested in Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega) and the cell lysates analyzed for luciferase activity with the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's recommendations.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)-Nuclear extracts from human esophageal cancer cells were produced according to standard methods (29Sambrook J. Russell D. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar). Extracts were aliquoted and stored at -70 °C. Equimolar amounts of complementary, single-stranded oligonucleotides were annealed and labeled with digoxigenin (DIG)-ddUTP by terminal transferase using a DIG Gel Shift kit (Roche). The oligonucleotide probes used in EMSA were as follows: probe W, 5′-GCCCGCAGTGCTGGGCGGGGCGCTGACTCACCCGGGCCCGGG-3′ (wild-type sequence); probe Sm, 5′-GCCCGCAGTGCTAATATTTGCGCTGACTCACCCGGGCCCGGG-3′ (mutated Sp1 binding site underlined); probe Am, 5′-GCCCGCAGTGCTGGGCGGGGCGCGTCGGATCCCGGGCCCGGG-3′ (mutated AP-1 binding site underlined); and probe SAm, 5′-GCCCGCAGTGCTAATATTTGCGCGTCGGATCCCGGGCCCGGG-3′ (both mutated Sp1 and AP-1 binding sites underlined). These probes corresponded to the human VIL2 5′-flanking sequence from -87 to -46. Each binding mixture (20 μl) for EMSA contained 5-10 μg of nuclear extract or 0.2-0.3 μg of recombinant protein, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm (NH4)2SO4, 0.2% (w/v) Tween 20, 30 mm KCl, 1 μg poly[d(I-C)], 0.1 μg of poly-l-lysine, and 0.05 pmol of labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe. Samples were incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and complexes were analyzed by electrophoresis on 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels (acrylamide/bis-acrylamide ratio of 29:1) in 0.5× TBE at 80 V for 180 min at 4 °C. The gels were then transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody and chemiluminescent substrate were used to detect digoxigenin (Dig Gel Shift kit), and immunoreactive bands were photographed and analyzed by a Flu- orChemTMIS-8900 (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). For analysis of blocking of Sp1 binding to DNA, DNA probes were preincubated for 1 h at 4 °C with increasing concentrations of mithramycin A (0.1, 1, or 10 μm) before use in binding reactions. In specific competition experiments, a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide was added to the binding reactions.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-EC109 cells were grown to 70-80% confluency on three 15-cm plates (∼4.5 × 107 cells per plate). Chromatin immunoprecipitation was carried out using the ChIP-IT kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA). Briefly, the enzymatically sheared chromatin was precleared with protein G beads and an aliquot saved as a positive control (input DNA). Aliquots of the precleared sheared chromatin were then immunoprecipitated using 2 μg of antibodies against IgG, Sp1, c-Jun, or c-Fos. The resulting DNA was used for PCR analysis, and the amplified DNA fragments were visualized on an agarose gel. PCR of immunoprecipitated DNA were carried out using human VIL2 promoter-specific primers and negative control primers flanking a region of genomic DNA between GAPDH and the chromosome condensation-related SMC-associated protein gene. The human VIL2 promoter-specific primers were 5′-CTCCCCATGCCCGCAGTGCT-3′ (VIL2 -95/-76 sequence) and 5′-GGTGAGTATCCTCGATCCCCGAAAA-3′ (VIL2 +123/+99 sequence). The negative control primers were 5′-ATGGTTGCCACTGGGGATCT-3′ and 5′-TGCCAAAGCCTAGGGGAAGA-3′.Real-time Reverse Transcription (RT)-Polymerase Chain Reaction-Total cellular RNA was extracted from EC109 cells with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and reverse transcribed to cDNA using the PrimeScript™ RT-PCR kit (TaKaRa, Dalian, China). The real-time RT-PCR assay was carried out with the Rotor-Gene 6000 system (Corbett Life Science, Sydney, Australia) using SYBR® Premix Ex Taq™ (TaKaRa) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All PCRs were done in triplicate. The sequences of VIL2 primers were designed based on the human VIL2 mRNA sequence (GenBank accession number NM_003379) as follows: VIL2 forward, 5′-AGCGCATCACTGAGGCAGAG-3′, and reverse, 5′-GCCGCAGCGTCTTGTACTTG-3′. The sequences of GAPDH primers were designed based on the human GAPDH mRNA sequence (GenBank accession number NM_002046) as follows: GAPDH forward, 5′-GCACCGTCAAGGCTGAGAAC-3′ and reverse, 5′-TGGTGAAGACGCCAGTGGA-3′. The absolute levels of mRNAs of VIL2 were normalized to that of GAPDH mRNA. The relative value from the vehicle-treated control group was considered equal to one arbitrary unit.Western Blot Analysis-Whole cell protein extracts were boiled for 5 min with Laemmli buffer and subjected to 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using standard methodology. Proteins were then transferred electrophoretically onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon, pore size 0.45 μm, Millipore, Bedford, MA) using a constant voltage of 60 V for 120 min. The membranes were then blocked in 5% nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature followed by the addition of the primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were then washed and incubated with a secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase for 1 h at room temperature. Antigen-antibody complexes were detected by Western blot luminol reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).Statistical Analysis-Data analysis was performed using SPSS 13.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). A two-tailed independent-sample t test was used to determine the significance of differences between groups. Differences were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05. Data are plotted as mean ± S.D. Survival was assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis, and the log-rank score was used to determine statistical significance.RESULTSEzrin Overexpression in ESCCs Is Associated with Poor Survival-Our recent study on ESCC samples showed that ezrin tends to translocate from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm in the progression from normal epithelium to invasive carcinoma of the esophagus (16Zeng H. Xu L. Xiao D. Zhang H. Wu X. Zheng R. Li Q. Niu Y. Shen Z. Li E. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2006; 54: 889-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Here, we confirmed this finding and further evaluated clinical significance. Ezrin immunoreactivity in normal esophageal epithelial tissue was weak to moderate in the membrane and cytoplasm (data not shown). However, ESCC tumors displayed one of four distinct immunostaining phenotypes (Fig. 1): intense diffuse membranous and/or cytoplasmic staining (Fig. 1A), moderate cytoplasmic staining (Fig. 1B), weak cytoplasmic staining (Fig. 1C), or no staining (Fig. 1D). Ezrin overexpression was defined as intense diffuse cytoplasmic and/or plasma membrane staining in >50% of tumor cells. In all, 90 of 193 tumors were designated as ezrin overexpressors. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (Fig. 2) demonstrated that ezrin overexpression was associated with decreased survival (p = 0.048).FIGURE 2Kaplan-Meier estimates of the survival by ezrin status. The survival rate for patients overexpressing ezrin was significantly lower than that for patients not overexpressing ezrin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Consensus Sp1 (-75/-69) and AP-1 (-64/-58) Binding Sites Are Essential for Human VIL2 Promoter Activity-To better understand the transcriptional regulation of ezrin in ESCCs, 1759 bp of the 5′-flanking region of human VIL2 and 134 bp of the transcribed sequence were cloned from EC109 cells (derived from ESCC) and sequenced (GenBank accession number EF184645). NCBI BLAST analysis (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST) showed that the cloned fragment had 99% identity with the corresponding segment of human VIL2 AL589931. The CpGPlot Program (www.ebi.ac.uk/emboss/cpgplot) revealed this fragment to be highly GC rich, with CpG islands located at -1564/-581, -558/-303, and -203/+77 (supplemental Fig. S2). Potential transcription factor binding sites within human VIL2 were identified through gene-regulation (www.gene-regulation.com/pub/programs/alibaba2). The analysis revealed multiple potential transcription factor binding sites in this fragment, many of them overlapping, and one site that is a putative target of several factors (supplemental Fig. S3). Moreover, the human VIL2 promoter region lacks a typical TATA box but contains numerous potential Sp1 binding sites, as is common with many GC-rich promoters (30Hapgood J.P. Riedemann J. Scherer S.D. Cell Biol. Int. 2001; 25: 17-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).Transient transfection of EC109 cells showed that the 5′-flanking region of human VIL2 (∼1.8 kb) could drive transcription of a luciferase reporter. To localize the regulatory region of promoter activity, a series of 5′-deletion mutants was constructed and analyzed. In EC109 cells, the -1324/+134 region of VIL2 directed maximum luciferase activity (Fig. 3A). The region -87/+134 had considerable reporter activity. Sequence deletion from -1324 to -890 caused an ∼50% reduction in luciferase activity, whereas 5′-deletion from -87 to -32 nearly abolished the activity. When compared with region -890/+134, further deletions, i.e. -696/+134, -213/+134, -146/+134, -97/+134, and -87/+134, did not markedly change the reporter activity. These data suggest that the region -1324/-890 positively regulates transcription and that the region -87/-32 regulates the promoter activity of human VIL2 in EC109 cells.FIGURE 3Transcriptional regulatory region of the human VIL2 5′-flanking region in EC109 cells.

https://openalex.org/W2033770635,"Nkx2.7 is the tinman-related gene, as well as orthologs of Nkx2.5 and Nkx-2.3. Nkx2.7 and Nkx2.5 express in zebrafish heart fields of lateral plate mesoderm. The temporal and spatial expression patterns of Nkx2.7 are similar to those of Nkx2.5, but their functions during cardiogenesis remain unclear.Here, Nkx2.7 is demonstrated to compensate for Nkx2.5 loss of function and play a predominant role in the lateral development of the heart, including normal cardiac looping and chamber formation. Knocking down Nkx2.5 showed that heart development was normal from 24 to 72 hpf. However, when knocking down either Nkx2.7 or Nkx2.5 together with Nkx2.7, it appeared that the heart failed to undergo looping and showed defective chambers, although embryos developed normally before the early heart tube stage. Decreased ventricular myocardium proliferation and defective myocardial differentiation appeared to result from late-stage up-regulation of bmp4, versican, tbx5 and tbx20, which were all expressed normally in hearts at an early stage. We also found that tbx5 and tbx20 were modulated by Nkx2.7 through the heart maturation stage because an inducible overexpression of Nkx2.7 in the heart caused down-regulation of tbx5 and tbx20. Although heart defects were induced by overexpression of an injection of 150-pg Nkx2.5 or 5-pg Nkx2.7 mRNA, either Nkx2.5 or Nkx2.7 mRNA rescued the defects induced by Nkx2.7-morpholino(MO) and Nkx2.5-MO with Nkx2.7-MO.Therefore, we conclude that redundant activities of Nkx2.5 and Nkx2.7 are required for cardiac morphogenesis, but that Nkx2.7 plays a more critical function, specifically indicated by the gain-of-function and loss-of- function experiments where Nkx2.7 is observed to regulate the expressions of tbx5 and tbx20 through the maturation stage."
https://openalex.org/W2131014580,"Sensory circuits frequently integrate converging inputs while maintaining precise functional relationships between them. For example, in mammals with stereopsis, neurons at the first stages of binocular visual processing show a close alignment of receptive-field properties for each eye. Still, basic questions about the global wiring mechanisms that enable this functional alignment remain unanswered, including whether the addition of a second retinal input to an otherwise monocular neural circuit is sufficient for the emergence of these binocular properties. We addressed this question by inducing a de novo binocular retinal projection to the larval zebrafish optic tectum and examining recipient neuronal populations using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging. Notably, neurons in rewired tecta were predominantly binocular and showed matching direction selectivity for each eye. We found that a model based on local inhibitory circuitry that computes direction selectivity using the topographic structure of both retinal inputs can account for the emergence of this binocular feature."
https://openalex.org/W2014760856,"Prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) is expressed in nociceptive neurons and functions as an ectonucleotidase. When injected intraspinally, the secretory isoforms of human and bovine PAP protein have potent and long-lasting antinociceptive effects that are dependent on A(1)-adenosine receptor (A(1)R) activation. In this study, we purified the secretory isoform of mouse (m)PAP using the baculovirus expression system to determine if recombinant mPAP also had antinociceptive properties. We found that mPAP dephosphorylated AMP, and to a much lesser extent, ADP at neutral pH (pH 7.0). In contrast, mPAP dephosphorylated all purine nucleotides (AMP, ADP, ATP) at an acidic pH (pH 5.6). The transmembrane isoform of mPAP had similar pH-dependent ectonucleotidase activity. A single intraspinal injection of mPAP protein had long-lasting (three day) antinociceptive properties, including antihyperalgesic and antiallodynic effects in the Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) inflammatory pain model. These antinociceptive effects were transiently blocked by the A(1)R antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1, 3-dipropylxanthine (CPX), suggesting mPAP dephosphorylates nucleotides to adenosine to mediate antinociception just like human and bovine PAP. Our studies indicate that PAP has species-conserved antinociceptive effects and has pH-dependent ectonucleotidase activity. The ability to metabolize nucleotides in a pH-dependent manner could be relevant to conditions like inflammation where tissue acidosis and nucleotide release occur. Lastly, our studies demonstrate that recombinant PAP protein can be used to treat chronic pain in animal models."

Here, we report our findings of a head-to-head comparison of two viral vectors modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) and a novel replication-competent modified vaccinia Tian Tan (MVTT) for inducing neutralizing antibodies (Nabs) via intramuscular and mucosal vaccinations in mice. MVTT is an attenuated variant of the wild-type VTT, which was historically used as a smallpox vaccine for millions of Chinese people. The spike glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV was used as the test antigen after the S gene was constructed in the identical genomic location of two vectors to generate vaccine candidates MVTT-S and MVA-S. Using identical doses, MVTT-S induced lower levels (∼2-3-fold) of anti- SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies (Nabs) than MVA-S through intramuscular inoculation. MVTT-S, however, was capable of inducing consistently 20-to-100-fold higher levels of Nabs than MVA-S when inoculated via either intranasal or intraoral routes. These levels of MVTT-S-induced Nab responses were substantially (∼10-fold) higher than that induced via the intramuscular route in the same experiments. Moreover, pre-exposure to the wild-type VTT via intranasal or intraoral route impaired the Nab response via the same routes of MVTT-S vaccination probably due to the pre-existing anti-VTT Nab response. The efficacy of intranasal or intraoral vaccination, however, was still 20-to-50-fold better than intramuscular inoculation despite the subcutaneous pre-exposure to wild-type VTT. Our data have implications for people who maintain low levels of anti-VTT Nabs after historical smallpox vaccination. MVTT is therefore an attractive live viral vector for mucosal vaccination."

However, exactly how tTG modulates the structural and functional properties of α-synuclein (α-syn) and contributes to the pathogenesis of PD remains unknown. Using site-directed mutagenesis combined with detailed biophysical and mass spectrometry analyses, we sought to identify the exact residues involved in tTG-catalyzed cross-linking of wild-type α-syn and α-syn mutants associated with PD. To better understand the structural consequences of each cross-linking reaction, we determined the effect of tTG-catalyzed cross-linking on the oligomerization, fibrillization, and membrane binding of α-syn in vitro. Our findings show that tTG-catalyzed cross-linking of monomeric α-syn involves multiple cross-links (specifically 2-3). We subjected tTG-catalyzed cross-linked monomeric α-syn composed of either wild-type or Gln → Asn mutants to sequential proteolysis by multiple enzymes and peptide mapping by mass spectrometry. Using this approach, we identified the glutamine and lysine residues involved in tTG-catalyzed intramolecular cross-linking of α-syn. These studies demonstrate for the first time that Gln79 and Gln109 serve as the primary tTG reactive sites. Mutating both residues to asparagine abolishes tTG-catalyzed cross-linking of α-syn and tTG-induced inhibition of α-syn fibrillization in vitro. To further elucidate the sequence and structural basis underlying these effects, we identified the lysine residues that form isopeptide bonds with Gln79 and Gln109.

Clinically, PD is manifested in symptoms that include tremors, rigidity, and difficulty in initiating movement (bradykinesia). Pathologically, PD is characterized by the presence of intraneuronal, cytoplasmic inclusions known as Lewy bodies (LB), which are composed primarily of the protein “α-synuclein” (α-syn) (1Spillantini M.G. Schmidt M.L. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Jakes R. Goedert M. Nature. 1997; 388: 839-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (6036) Google Scholar) and are seen in the post-mortem brains of PD patients with the sporadic or familial forms of the disease (2Pollanen M.S. Bergeron C. Weyer L. Brain Res. 1993; 603: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). α-Syn is a presynaptic protein of 140 residues with a “natively” unfolded structure (3Riess O. Jakes R.

Three missense point mutations in α-syn (A30P, E46K, and A53T) are associated with the early-onset, dominant, inherited form of PD (4Polymeropoulos M.H. Lavedan C. Leroy E. Ide S.E. Dehejia A.

Moreover, duplication or triplication of the α-syn gene has been linked to the familial form of PD, suggesting that an increase in α-syn expression is sufficient to cause PD. Together, these findings suggest that α-syn plays a central role in the pathogenesis of PD. The molecular and cellular determinants that govern α-syn oligomerization and fibrillogenesis in vivo remain poorly understood. In vitro aggregation studies have shown that the mutations associated with PD (A30P, E46K, and A53T) accelerate α-syn oligomerization, but only E46K and A53T α-syn show higher propensity to fibrillize than wild-type (WT) α-syn (6Conway K.A.

Tissue transglutaminase catalyzes a calcium-dependent transamidating reaction involving glutamine and lysine residues, which results in the formation of a covalent cross-link via ϵ-(γ-glutamyl) lysine bonds (Fig. 2F). To date, seven different isoforms of tTGs have been reported, of which only tTG2 seems to be expressed in the human brain (19Kim S.Y. Marekov L. Bubber P. Browne S.E. Stavrovskaya I. Lee J.

Subsequent immuno-histochemical, colocalization, and immunoprecipitation studies have shown that the levels of tTG and cross-linked α-syn species are increased in the substantia nigra of PD brains (17Junn E.

These findings, combined with the known role of tTG in cross-linking and stabilizing bimolecular assemblies, led to the hypothesis that tTG plays an important role in the initiation and propagation of α-syn fibril formation and that it contributes to fibril stability in LBs. This hypothesis was initially supported by in vitro studies demonstrating that tTG catalyzes the polymerization of the α-syn-derived non-amyloid component (NAC) peptide via intermolecular covalent cross-linking of residues Gln79 and Lys80 (21Jensen P.H. Sorensen E.S. Petersen T.E. Gliemann J. Rasmussen L.K. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and by other studies suggesting that tTG promotes the fibrillization of amyloidogenic proteins implicated in the pathogenesis of other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease, supranuclear palsy, Huntington disease, and other polyglutamine diseases (22Wang D.S. Dickson D.W. Malter J.S. Int. J. Clin. Exp. Pathol. 2008; 1: 5-18PubMed Google Scholar, 23Zemaitaitis M.O. Lee J.M. Troncoso J.C. Muma N.A. J. Neuropathol. Exp.

However, recent in vitro studies with full-length α-syn have shown that tTG catalyzes intramolecular cross-linking of monomeric α-syn and inhibits, rather than promotes, its fibrillization in vitro (25Konno T. Morii T. Hirata A. Sato S. Oiki S. Ikura K. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 2072-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 26Segers-Nolten I.M. Wilhelmus M.M. Veldhuis G. van Rooijen B.D. Drukarch B.

The structural basis of this inhibitory effect and the exact residues involved in tTG-mediated cross-linking of α-syn, as well as structural and functional consequences of these modifications, remain poorly understood. In this study, we have identified the primary glutamine and lysine residues involved in tTG-catalyzed, intramolecularly cross-linked monomeric α-syn and investigated how cross-linking these residues affects the oligomerization, fibrillization, and membrane binding of α-syn in vitro. Using single-site mutagenesis and mass spectrometry applied to exhaustive proteolytic digests of native and cross-linked monomeric α-syn, we identified Gln109 and Gln79 as the major tTG substrates. We demonstrate that the altered electrophoretic mobility of the intramolecularly cross-linked α-syn in SDS-PAGE occurs as a result of tTG-catalyzed cross-linking of Gln109 to lysine residues in the N terminus of α-syn, which leads to the formation of more compact monomers. Consistent with previous studies, we show that intramolecularly cross-linked α-syn forms off-pathway oligomers that are distinct from those formed by the wild-type protein and that do not convert to fibrils within the time scale of our experiments (3-5 days). We also show that membrane-bound α-syn is a substrate of tTG and that intramolecular cross-linking does not interfere with the ability of monomeric α-syn to adopt an α-helical conformation upon binding to synthetic membranes. These studies provide novel mechanistic insight into the sequence and structural basis of events that allow tTG to inhibit α-syn fibrillogenesis, and they shed light on the potential role of tTG-catalyzed cross-linking in modulating the physiological and pathogenic properties of α-syn. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of α-Syn Variants—Site-directed mutagenesis of α-syn was performed using PCR with the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). A pT7 plasmid carrying the human wild-type α-syn gene was used as a template for mutagenesis. The following mutations were introduced using appropriate mutagenesis primers: Q79N, Q109N, K32R, K34R, K80R, and K96R. The double mutants Q79N/Q109N and K32R/K34R were obtained by introducing a second mutation into the gene containing the corresponding first mutation. All constructs were verified by sequencing. Wild-type α-syn protein and its mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (12Paleologou K.E. Schmid A.W. Rospigliosi C.C. Kim H.Y. Lamberto G.R. Fredenburg R.A.

Cross-linking Reactions—Purified human WT or mutant α-syn (35 μm) was cross-linked with 0.008 unit of guinea pig tTG for 2 h at 37 °C. Reaction solutions contained 10 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mm HEPES, and 5 mm CaCl2, unless otherwise stated. The enzyme was omitted from control samples because preliminary experiments showed that the omission of CaCl2 or tTG from the reaction produced similar results. Reactions were quenched by the addition of excess EDTA (25 mm), and the degree of cross-linking was assessed by native PAGE, SDS-PAGE, and mass spectrometry. Prior to gel loading, aggregates of very high molecular weight that formed during the incubation were removed using microcon filters with a molecular mass cutoff of 100 kDa (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The retentate (high molecular weight aggregates) and the flow-through solution (monomeric α-syn) were analyzed by 12% native PAGE or SDS-PAGE. Preparation of Large Unilamellar Vesicles, Small Unilamellar Vesicles, and α-Syn-Liposome Complexes—1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)] sodium salt (POPG, Avanti Polar Lipids Inc., Pelham, AL) was purchased as a chloroform solution, and the solvent was removed by evaporation and lyophilization. The phospholipid was resuspended to a final concentration of 10 mg/ml in a solution of 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl. To increase the efficiency of large unilamellar vesicles formation, 10 cycles of freezing in dry ice and thawing in a 37 °C water bath were carried out. Small unilamellar vesicles were prepared by extrusion through a 100-nm polycarbonate membrane (Avestin, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The large unilamellar vesicles and small unilamellar vesicle preparations were stored at 4 °C and used within 5 days. Cross-linking of Membrane-bound α-Syn—For vesicle-binding assays, 10 μm α-syn was incubated with freshly prepared POPG vesicles at a mass ratio of 1:18 in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 200 μm CaCl2. The CaCl2 concentration was optimized to prevent salt-induced dissociation of membrane-bound α-syn. The membrane binding of α-syn prior to and after the cross-linking reaction was analyzed by monitoring the extent of α-helical structure in membrane-bound α-syn using CD spectroscopy. Finally, the release of α-syn from the vesicles was triggered by the addition of 300 mm NaCl, and the samples were passed through filters with a molecular mass cutoff of 100 kDa to separate the released α-syn from that contained in the vesicles. The filtrate was subjected to SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry (MS) analysis to assess the cross-linking state of α-syn. Far-UV Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—Far-UV CD spectra were recorded at 25 °C in a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter at protein concentrations of 10 or 30 μm in degassed 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) using 0.1-cm cuvettes. As many as six spectra were collected for each sample to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. All spectra were corrected for the buffer base line. Proteolytic Digestions—α-Syn samples were digested in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.6) and 150 mm NaCl using chymotrypsin, Lys-C, and/or Glu-C at a protein-to-enzyme ratio of 100:1 (w/w) unless otherwise stated. Glu-C and chymotrypsin were obtained from Bioconcept (Switzerland), and Lys-C was purchased from Wako (Neuss, Germany). Digestions were carried out for 2 h at 37 °C or overnight at room temperature. Reactions were stopped by the addition of trifluoroacetic acid to a final concentration of 2%. Samples were digested with chymotrypsin or trypsin gold (Promega, Dübendorf, Switzerland) overnight, unless otherwise stated. The digestion was stopped with 1 μl of 10% trifluoroacetic acid, and samples were stored at 4 °C until further use. Infusion Electrospray Ionization-Mass Spectrometry—Samples were infused at a low flow rate (250 nl/min) through a TriVersa NanoMate source (Advion BioSystems, Ithaca, NY), and MS detection was performed with an LTQ ion trap (Thermo Scientific, Wohlen, Switzerland). After proteolytic digestion, 1.5-2 μg of each sample was desalted and concentrated using C18 Stage Tips (Proxeon, Odense, Denmark) and subsequently analyzed. Specific peptide sequence information was generated by manual collision-induced dissociation fragmentation of the peaks of interest, and Ultra-Zoom single-ion monitoring mode was used when high resolution acquisitions were required. The GPMAW tool (version 7.1, Lighthouse data, Odense, Denmark) was used to generate a list of expected peptides from the different enzymatic digestions, as well as to compute their theoretical fragmentation patterns. The comparison of experimentally measured fragmentation signatures against theoretical ones was performed manually. Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization-Time-of-Flight-Mass Spectrometry—Aliquots (2 μl) of intact purified protein samples were used for MALDI-TOF-MS measurements. Two matrix solutions were prepared as follows: a saturated solution of sinapinic acid in methanol (matrix solution 1) and a 14 mg/ml sinapinic acid solution in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile (1:1, matrix solution 2). Depending on the sample and the initial conditions, a dried droplet or a two-layer sample preparation was selected for the molecular weight analysis. For the two-layer preparation, a thin matrix layer was first generated on the target plate using matrix solution 1. The sample (1 μl) were mixed with 1 μl of sinapinic acid/matrix solution 2 and then 0.5 μl of this mixture was deposited on top of the thin layer and allowed to air-dry. In the dried droplet method, the mixture of sample and matrix was deposited directly on the target plate. Samples were deposited twice and analyzed with an ABI 4800 MALDI-TOF/TOF instrument in linear mode (Applied Biosystems, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). Typically, 2400 laser shots were summed by random sampling of the surface to generate the spectra that were calibrated externally using the [M + H]+ peak of insulin, ubiquitin, and cytochrome c, all of which were prepared with the same matrix and deposited close to the samples. Sample Preparation for Analysis of Protein Digests—Digested protein samples were desalted on C18 StageTips (Proxeon, Odense, Denmark) and mixed 1:1 with either 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (20 mg/ml in 1% picolinic acid/acetonitrile (1:1 v/v)) or α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (7 mg/ml in acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (1:1 v/v)). Typically, 0.5 μl of this mixture was deposited on the target plate and allowed to air-dry. Samples were analyzed on an ABI 4800 MALDI-TOF/TOF instrument in reflectron mode. Native and SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—Gels were prepared using standard Laemmli techniques. Gels were stained with Simply Blue Safe Stain (Invitrogen). For Western blot analysis, the separated proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Omnilab, Mettmenstetten, Switzerland). The membrane was blocked for 1 h at room temperature under constant rocking using Odyssey blocking buffer (Li-COR Biosciences, Bad Homburg, Germany) and diluted 1:3 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Membranes were incubated with the following primary mouse monoclonal antibodies at 4 °C with constant rocking overnight: mouse anti-α-syn (1:1000 dilution; epitope, residues 15-123 of α-syn; BD Transduction Laboratories), sc-211 (1:500 dilution; epitope, residues 21-125 of α-syn; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Zymed LB 509 (1:500 dilution; epitope, residues 115-122 of α-syn; Zymed Laboratories Inc.), H3C (1:500 dilution; epitope, amino acids 128-140 of α-syn), and 7071 (1:1000 dilution; epitope, N terminus of α-syn). H3C and 7071 antibodies were kindly provided by Dr. Julia George (Urbana, IL) and Dr. Peter Lansbury (Cambridge, MA), respectively. For detection of γ-glutamyl-lysine cross-links, the mouse monoclonal IgM antibody 81D4 was used (1:500 dilution; Covalab, Villeurbanne, France). Membranes were washed four times with PBS-T (0.01% PBS containing Tween 20), followed by incubation with goat anti-mouse IgM conjugated to Alexa Fluor 680 or, in the case of the 81D4 antibody, to Alexa Fluor 800. Finally, membranes were washed four times with PBS-T and three times with PBS and scanned in a Li-COR scanner at a wavelength of 700 nm or, in the case of the 81D4 antibody, a wavelength of 800 nm. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)—Samples of α-syn (5-10 μl) were deposited on Formvar-coated 200 mesh copper grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA). Grids were washed with two drops of double-distilled H2O and stained with 2 drops of freshly prepared 1% (w/v) uranyl acetate (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Specimens were viewed on a Philips CIME 12 electron microscope, operated at 80 kV. Digitized photographs were recorded with a slow scan CCD camera (Gatan, model 679). Aggregation Studies Using the Thioflavin T (ThT) Fluorescence Assay—A sample of α-syn (35 μm, 400 μl) was incubated at 37 °C with constant rotation. Samples for ThT readings and TEM were taken after 24, 48, and 72 h of incubation, unless stated otherwise. Fibril formation was monitored by ThT fluorescence assay. Readings were carried out with both the protein and ThT concentration of 5 μm each in 100 μl of 50 mm glycine-NaOH (pH 8.5). ThT fluorescence measurements were recorded on an “Analyst AD” spectrometer (Bucher Biotec, Basel, Switzerland) at an excitation wavelength of 450 nm and an emission wavelength of 485 nm. The relative fluorescence at 485 nm was used as a measure of the amount of fibrillar aggregates formed in solution. All samples were analyzed in triplicate and corrected for the fluorescence level of freshly solubilized α-syn. Values are expressed as the percentage increase in ThT fluorescence of three measurements (means ± S.D.). Data were plotted using Prism Graph Pad (version 4.0). tTG Intramolecular Cross-linking Alters the Conformational Properties of the C-terminal Region ofα-Syn—Purified human WT and mutantα-syn (30 μm) were cross-linked with tTG (0.008 unit) for 2 h at 37 °C. Prior to gel loading, the cross-linking reaction mixture was passed through a filter with a molecular mass cutoff of 100 kDa to remove larger aggregates (retentate) that formed during the incubation. The cross-linked monomeric species, which elute through this filter, were then analyzed by 12% native PAGE. Fig. 1A shows that the presence of tTG resulted in a significant shift in the migration of monomeric α-syn (lanes 4-6). Under these conditions, we observed ≥90% cross-linking of WTα-syn or the PD-associated mutants A30P and A53T. The cross-linking products of α-syn are monomeric and contain only intramolecular cross-links. Although these observations have been highlighted in previous studies (25Konno T. Morii T. Hirata A. Sato S. Oiki S. Ikura K. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 2072-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 26Segers-Nolten I.M. Wilhelmus M.M. Veldhuis G. van Rooijen B.D. Drukarch B. Subramaniam V. Protein Sci. 2008; 17: 1395-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), the structural basis underlying the altered electrophoretic mobility of cross-linked monomeric α-syn has remained a mystery. The CD spectra of native and intramolecularly cross-linked monomeric α-syn were virtually identical and were consistent with a random coil structure (Fig. 8). We hypothesized that the conformational changes induced by tTG-catalyzed cross-linking should affect the ability of antibodies to recognize the monomer. To test this hypothesis, tTG cross-linked human WT, A30P, and A53T α-syn samples were analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies against various regions of α-syn as follows: N-terminal region (7071 and BD Biosciences (epitope residues 15-123)), C-terminal region (sc-211 (epitope residues 121-125)), H3C region (epitope residues 128-140), and LB 509 region (epitope residues 115-122). As expected, all the N- and C-terminal antibodies recognized the bands corresponding to native, noncross-linked WT and mutant α-syn (Fig. 1A, lanes 1-3). The intramolecularly cross-linked monomeric α-syn was recognized by antibodies against residues within the C-terminal region 121-140, but not by antibodies specific for residues in the C-terminal region of 115-122. Interestingly, the intramolecularly cross-linked monomers were only weakly detected by antibodies against the N-terminal region of α-syn (Fig. 1A, lanes 4-6). These findings suggest that tTG catalyzes the formation of intramolecular cross-links involving C-terminal and N-terminal residues in monomeric α-syn. The monoclonal antibody 81D4, which reacts with N-ϵ (γ-l-glutamyl)-l-lysine isopeptides, recognized full-length cross-linked α-syn but not the native monomeric protein (supplemental Fig. 1).FIGURE 8tTG cross-linking does not interfere with the binding ofα-syn to lipid vesicle membranes. A, CD spectra of cross-linked (cl)α-syn in the presence of vesicles. In the presence of POPG vesicles, cross-linked A30P α-syn undergoes a change in secondary structure from random-coil (—) to α-helices (- - -). B, SDS-PAGE analysis of membrane-bound native (lane 5) and cross-linked (lane 6) monomeric α-syn from A after passage through a filter with a molecular mass cutoff of 100 kDa.

C and D, CD spectra of membrane-bound WT and Q mutant α-syn before (C) and after (D) cross-linking.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further probe the conformational differences between native and intramolecularly cross-linked monomeric α-syn, we subjected both species to proteolysis by chymotrypsin. Proteolytic digestion of 30 μm native α-syn (WT, A30P, or A53T) at a protein/enzyme ratio of 100:1 produced a proteolytic fragment of ∼5 kDa, which corresponded to residues 40-94 (Fig. 1B, lanes 5-7). The corresponding tTG cross-linked monomers were partially resistant to chymotrypsin proteolysis (Fig. 1B, lanes 11-13), as evidenced by the presence of multiple bands in the range of 5-17 kDa. This result suggests significant conformational differences between the native and cross-linked α-syn monomer. tTG-mediated Intramolecular"
https://openalex.org/W2153677161,"Repellents of the maize pathogen Ustilago maydis are involved in formation of hydrophobic aerial hyphae and in cellular attachment. These peptides, called Rep1-1 to Rep1-11, are encoded by the rep1 gene and result from cleavage of the precursor protein Rep1 during passage of the secretion pathway. Using green fluorescent protein as a reporter, we here show that rep1 is expressed in filaments and not in the yeast form of U. maydis. In situ hybridization localized rep1 mRNA in the apex of the filament, which correlates with the expected site of secretion of the repellents into the cell wall. We also produced a synthetic peptide, Rep1-1. This peptide reduced the water surface tension to as low as 36 mJ m-2. In addition, it formed amyloid-like fibrils as was shown by negative staining, by thioflavin T fluorescence, and by x-ray diffraction. These fibrils were not soluble in SDS but could be dissociated with trifluoroacetic acid. The repellents in the hyphal cell wall had a similar solubility and also stained with thioflavin T, strongly indicating that they are present as amyloid fibrils. However, such fibrils could not be observed at the hyphal surface. This can be explained by the fact that the Rep1-1 filaments decrease in length at increasing concentrations. Taken together, we have identified the second class of fungal proteins that form functional amyloid-like filaments at the hyphal surface.

Ustilago maydis is the causal agent of smut in Zea mays (maize) and Euchlaena mexicana (Mexican teosinte). A filamentous pathogenic dikaryon is formed upon fusion of compatible yeast-like sporidia. Differentiation in the plant leads to the formation of diploid teliospores, which undergo meiosis ultimately resulting in haploid sporidia (see Refs. 1Banuett F. Trends Genet. 1992; 8: 174-180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 2Banuett F. Herskowitz I. Adv.

The American Phytopathological Society, St. Paul, MN1963: 41Google Scholar).Fusion of haploid cells and development of an infectious dikaryon are controlled by the a and b mating type loci. The a locus regulates cell fusion through a pheromone-based recognition system (4Bölker M. Urban M. Kahmann R. Cell. 1992; 68: 441-450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), and the b locus controls post-fusion steps of pathogenic development, including hyphal growth. The latter locus encodes two unrelated homeodomain proteins, bE and bW, that form heterodimers when they are derived from different alleles (5Gillissen B. Bergemann J. Sandmann C. Schroeer B.

Cell. 1995; 81: 73-83Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). This heterodimer regulates a number of genes, among which the rep1 gene (7Bohlmann R.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4274-4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This gene is highly expressed resulting in 2.5% of the mRNA. It encodes a preproprotein that, after processing at KEX2 recognition sites, results in 11 secreted peptides with a high sequence similarity. These peptides are localized in the cell wall of filaments, in an SDS-insoluble, but trifluoroacetic acid-extractable form (10Wösten H.A.B. Bohlmann R. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Bölker M. Kahmann R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4274-4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). They are involved in formation of hydrophobic aerial hyphae (10Wösten H.A.B. Bohlmann R. Eckerskorn C.

Bohlmann R. Kahmann R. Kämper J. Wösten H.A. Microbiology. 2006; 152: 3607-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar); as such they have functionally replaced hydrophobins in U. maydis (11Teertstra W.R. Deelstra H.J. Vranes M. Bohlmann R.

Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 625-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). They do so by forming an amphipathic protein film, which consists of amyloid-like fibrils (13Wösten H.A.B. de Vocht M.L. Biochim. Biophys.

We here show that the repellent Rep1-1 also forms surface-active amyloid fibrils and that this peptide is specifically produced in filaments. Apparently, the amyloid structure is important for function in fungal development.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains and Growth Conditions-The U. maydis strains FB1 (a1b1), FB2 (a2b2) (16Banuett F. Herskowitz I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5878-5882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and SG200 (a1mfa2 bE1/bW2) (17Bölker M. Genin S. Lehmler C. Kahmann R. Can. J. Bot. 1995; 73: S320-S325Crossref Google Scholar) were used in this study. The non-isogenic strains FB1 and FB2 grow yeast-like in liquid medium. These strains are compatible and form a dikaryon upon mating that grows filamentous in contact with air. SG200 is a derivative of FB1 and harbors an active b mating type complex. As a consequence, this strain forms yeast-like cells in liquid medium and forms filaments at the water-air interface without the need for mating. U. maydis was grown at 25 °C using liquid or solidified (1.5% agarose) nitrate minimal medium (18Holliday R. King R.C. Handbook of Genetics. Plenum Press, New York1974: 575-595Google Scholar) or liquid YEPS medium (0.4% yeast extract, 0.4% peptone, 2% sucrose).

A 0.17-mm layer of solidified medium was used for in situ hybridization.Rep1 Reporter Construct and Rep1 Constitutive Expression-The promoter region of the rep1 gene was amplified from genomic DNA of FB1 using Phusion™ polymerase (Finnzymes) with oligonucleotide primers prRep-fw (CGCTATGACCTGGCCTAAAG) and prRep-rev (GTCAGCACGCTGATGGAAAG). The resulting 1844-bp PCR fragment was used as a template in a PCR reaction with nested PCR primers prRep-KpnI-fw (GGTACCGCAGCAATCACAGAG) and prRep-NcoI-rev (TGGAAGCCATGGTTGTAGTCGA), introducing KpnI and NcoI restriction sites, respectively. The resulting 1688-bp fragment was introduced in the SmaI site of pUC19 and was amplified in Escherichia coli DH5α. Subsequently, the KpnI/NcoI promoter fragment of Rep1 was introduced in the corresponding sites of pMF3c (19Brachmann A. König J. Julius C. Feldbrügge M. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2004; 272: 216-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). As a result, eGFP was placed under control of the Rep1 promoter, resulting in construct pMF3c-prRep.The O2tef promoter (19Brachmann A. König J. Julius C. Feldbrügge M. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2004; 272: 216-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR using primers Otef-fw (TGGGCCCGGTCGACTCTAGAACTAGTG) and Otef-rev (TACCATGGATCCCGTGGATGATGTTGTC), whereas the rep1 coding sequence (10Wösten H.A.B. Bohlmann R. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Bölker M. Kahmann R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4274-4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) was amplified using primers Rep-fw (TACCATGGCTTCCAAGATCG) and Rep-rev (AGGCGCGCCAGAGGTGTTTCTTC). The PCR products contained ApaI and NcoI and NcoI and AscI sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends of the products, respectively. These fragments were cloned in vector pMF3c (19Brachmann A. König J. Julius C. Feldbrügge M. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2004; 272: 216-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), thereby removing the eGFP coding sequence. The resulting vector was named pMF3c-OR.Transformation of U. maydis-pMF3c-OR and pMF3c-prRep were introduced in U. maydis after digestion with AgeI thus linearizing the plasmid in the carboxin resistance cassette. U. maydis was transformed according to Brachmann et al. (19Brachmann A. König J. Julius C. Feldbrügge M. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2004; 272: 216-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), and transformants were selected on carboxin-containing PDA plates (2 μg ml-1). Targeting to the succinate dehydrogenase gene sdh2 (um00844) was confirmed by Southern analysis. To this end, U. maydis chromosomal DNA was isolated as described previously (20Hoffman C.S. Winston F. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 57: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (2030) Google Scholar) and blotted on Hybond N+ (Amersham Biosciences). Hybridization was performed at 60 °C in 0.5 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 7% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, using a [α-32P]dCTP-labeled 1.9-kb NotI carboxin cassette as a probe.Rep1 Expression Analysis Using in Situ Hybridization-In situ hybridization was performed according to Teertstra et al. (21Teertstra W.R. Lugones L.G. Wösten H.A.B. Fungal Genet. Biol. 2004; 41: 1099-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Cultures that had been grown in an agarose slab of 20 × 20 mm were fixed for 2 h at 20 °C with freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4. After washing with buffer, the agarose slab cultures were placed overnight at -20 °C in excess 50% ethanol in PBS (v/v). The agarose slabs were placed on a coverslip (22 × 22 mm) and stepwise rehydrated (30% ethanol in PBS; 10% ethanol in PBS; and twice in PBS, each step for 10 min). The remaining fluid was removed with a piece of filter paper, and the coverslip with the agarose slab was placed in a hybridization chamber (Corning Inc.). 50 μl of hybridization buffer (100 mm NaCl, 0.5% SDS in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0) was added, after which a Hybri-slip (22 × 22 mm, Molecular Probes) was placed on top of the buffer. The hybridization buffer contained an EuUni PNA probe (120 nm) and a rep PNA probe (300 nm). The eukaryotic 18 S rRNA EuUni probe (ACCAGACTTGCCCTC) (22Perry-O’Keefe H. Rigby S. Oliveira K. Sørensen D. Stender H. Coull J. Hyldig-Nielsen J.J. J. Microbiol. Methods. 2001; 47: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and the rep mRNA probe (GATCAGCTTGTTCTC) were (5′) N-terminally labeled with fluorescein and Cy3, respectively. These probes had a Tm between 65 °C and 70 °C at the concentrations used (Applied Biosystems and Panagene). Hybridization was performed at 54 °C in a water bath for 1 h. The agarose slabs were washed three times for 20 min with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 1 mm EDTA (TE buffer) at 54 °C and mounted on microscope slides using Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories).Peptide Synthesis-The N-acetyl carboxyamide form of the Rep1-1 peptide HYEYKSYNAGHNVESVVENKLVDASDLTLGVDIL-NH2 was assembled on an automatic ABI 433A Peptide Synthesizer using the ABI FastMoc 0.25-mmol protocols according to the instructions of the manufacturer. 9-Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc)-amino acid derivatives, activated in situ using O-(benzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate/N-hydroxybenzotriazole and N,N′-diisopropylethylamine in N-methylpyrrolidone were used in coupling steps of 45 min. The peptide was deprotected and cleaved from the resin by treatment with 10 ml of trifluoroacetic acid, 0.25 ml of H2O, and 0.25 ml of triisopropylsilane for 2 h at room temperature. Finally, the peptide was precipitated in methyl-tert-butylether/n-hexane (1/1, v/v), dissolved in 60 ml of tert-BuOH/water (1/1, v/v), and lyophilized. Preparative HPLC was performed using a semiautomatic HPLC system (Applied Biosystems) with a preparative reversed-phase column Phenomenex Luna C8 (100 Å, 10 μm, 250 × 21.2 mm, Phenomenex), a UV detector operating at 214 nm, and a flow rate of 12 ml min-1. Analytical HPLC was performed using an automatic HPLC system (Shimadzu) with an analytical reversed-phase column Phenomenex Luna C8 (100 Å, 5 μm, 250 × 4.6 mm), a UV detector operating at 214 nm, and a flow rate of 1 ml min-1. The buffers used were 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water/acetonitrile (95/5, buffer A) and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile/water (60/40, buffer B). The peptide was eluted with a linear gradient from 100% A to 100% B over 48 min (analytical) or with a linear gradient from 25% A to 77% B over 81 min (preparative). The peptide was characterized using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (Kratos AXIMA CFR) with bovine insulin-oxidized B chain as the external reference (monoisotopic [M+H]+ = 3,494.6513) and α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as matrix. The calculated and detected monoisotopic masses [M+H]+ for Rep1-1 (C170H263N44O57) were determined as 3832.9034 and 3832.424, respectively.SDS-PAGE-Proteins were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE gels and stained with colloidal Coomassie R-250 (23Neuhoff V. Arold N. Taube D. Ehrhardt W. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (2342) Google Scholar).Surface Activity-Surface activity was measured with the Krüss Drop Shape Analysis system DSA10 Mk2 (Krüss) using 18-μl droplets of Rep1-1 solution.Thioflavin T Fluorescence-Strains were grown on square siliconized coverslips of 22 × 22 mm (Hampton research) to induce filamentous growth. To this end, a 30-μl droplet of water containing 106 cells from a culture in logarithmic phase was placed in the middle of the coverslip. Cells were grown under humid conditions for 40 h (11Teertstra W.R. Deelstra H.J. Vranes M. Bohlmann R. Kahmann R. Kämper J. Wösten H.A. Microbiology. 2006; 152: 3607-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The water was removed with a pipette, and the coverslips with attached hyphae were submerged in 7.5 μm ThT in PBS for 30 min in the dark. For yeast-like growth, strains were grown in YEPS at 28 °C. After washing with H2O once, cells were resuspended in 7.5 μm ThT in PBS and incubated for 30 min in the dark. 5 μl of the suspension (containing 80,000 cells) was spotted on a coverslip that was coated with a thin layer of 1.5% agarose to adhere the cells. Filaments and yeasts were examined with the confocal microscope immediately after staining (see below). To study the interaction of ThT with synthetic Rep1-1, fluorescence of 25 μm of the dye in 50 mm glycine buffer, pH 9.0, was recorded at 485 nm in the presence or absence of 30 μg ml-1 peptide. Fluorescence in the absence of ThT or protein was used for background subtraction, and 2.5 μg ml-1 human amyloid-β was used as a positive control. Samples were analyzed after 10 min of incubation at room temperature, using an Ascent Fluoroskan fluorescence spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific).Fluorescence Microscopy-Fluorescein and GFP fluorescence were monitored using a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter set, whereas a Cy3 filter was used for detection of Cy3. Fluorescence microscopy was done using a Zeiss Axioscope 2PLUS equipped with an HBO 100-watt mercury lamp and a Photometrics Cool SNAP camera (1392 × 1024 pixels) connected to a computer. For expression studies, confocal laser scanning microscopy was performed at a resolution of 1024 × 1024 pixels with a Zeiss LSM 5 Pascal equipped with an argon 488 nm and a helium/neon 543 nm laser line. Maximal intensity in the Z-axis was projected. Sequential scans were made to visualize fluorescein and Cy3 in co-hybridization experiments. For ThT staining, confocal laser scanning microscopy was performed at a resolution of 1024 × 1024 pixels with a Zeiss LSM 5 Pascal equipped with an argon 488 nm laser line. Single images were taken using a BP filter of 470–500 nm.Electron Microscopy-5 μl of an aqueous solution of Rep1-1 was dried down on carbon-coated grids and negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate. Samples were viewed using transmission electron microscopy (Technai 10, FEI) at 100 kV. To analyze the ultrastructure of filaments of the dikaryon FB1 × FB2, 50,000 cells of each of the parental strains were seeded in a 30-μl droplet of water placed in the middle of a square of Teflon sheet (fluorinated ethylene propylene, 0.25-mm thick; Norton Fluorplast, Raamsdonkveer, The Netherlands). Cells were grown under humid conditions, and after 40 h the droplet was removed. Hyphae that had attached to the Teflon were fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde/PBS and postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide. After acetone dehydration the hyphae were critical point-dried followed by Pt/Pd sputter coating. Cells were viewed with a field emission scanning electron microscope at 5 kV (FEI). Spores of Aspergillus niger served as a positive control.X-ray Diffraction-A solution of 300 μg ml-1 Rep1-1 was vortexed for 3 min. The sample was centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g, and the pellet was taken up in 1/10th volume. After introducing an aliquot in a glass capillary, the sample was allowed to dry at ambient conditions. X-ray diffraction data were recorded on a Mar Image Plate using CuKα radiation from a Bruker AXS FR591 generator with rotating anode and Montel 200 mirrors. The capillaries were placed in a position perpendicular to the x-ray beam at a distance of 250 mm from the detector. Scattering of air and the capillary was subtracted by using in-house software (VIEW/EVAL) (24Duisenberg A.J.M. Kroon-Batenburg L.M.J. Schreurs A.M.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 220-229Crossref Scopus (1116) Google Scholar).RESULTSRepellents Are Specifically Expressed in Filaments of U. maydis-Strains FB1 and SG200 were transformed with pMF3c-prRep, which contains the eGFP gene behind the 1688-bp rep1 promoter. Southern analysis showed that the plasmid had been targeted into the sdh2 gene in transformants WR1 and WR2, which have an FB1 and a SG200 background, respectively (data not shown; see “Experimental Procedures” for details). These strains were grown on slices of nitrate minimal medium in between an object glass and coverslip (Fig. 1A). Cells of the FB1 derivative WR1 grew mainly yeast-like on the agar layer (Fig. 1B). Some filaments were formed that grew into the air (Fig. 1D). These filaments, but not the yeast-like cells, showed GFP fluorescence (Fig. 1, C and E). Cells of the SG200 derivative WR2, which encompasses active a- and b-mating type complexes, grew yeast-like on the agarose medium (Fig. 1F). From this layer, hyphae grew into the air (Fig. 1H) as well as into the medium (Fig. 1F). At a depth of 0.5 mm the filaments adopted a yeast-like morphology again (Fig. 1F). Both the aerial and substrate hyphae expressed eGFP, whereas expression was not observed in the yeasts (Fig. 1, G and I).GFP fluorescence correlated with in situ hybridization using an rep1 PNA probe that binds to 5 of the 12 repeats within this gene. The PNA probe was found to hybridize in filaments of SG200, whereas no hybridization was observed in the SG200Δrep1 strain (Fig. 2, C and D). The 18 S PNA probe was detected both in yeasts and filaments of these strains in a co-hybridization experiment (Fig. 2, A and B). Interestingly, the rep1 probe was mainly observed in the apical part of hyphae of the SG200 strain.FIGURE 2In situ co-hybridization of 18 S rRNA (A and B) and rep1 mRNA (C and D) in SG200 (A, C, and E) and in SG200Δrep1 (B, D, and F).

Similar to the peptide residing in the cell wall (10Wösten H.A.B. Bohlmann R. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Bölker M. Kahmann R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4274-4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) synthetic Rep1-1 was only soluble in water or 2% SDS after treatment with trifluoroacetic acid. The peptide of 3.7 kDa ran at an apparent molecular mass of 21 kDa (data not shown), indicating that Rep1-1 forms oligomers.The water surface activity of the peptide at a concentration of 100 μg ml-1 was hard to measure. The shape of the drop hanging at the tip of a syringe changed readily (Fig. 3B) and often detached after a few minutes. In those cases that the droplet remained attached, surface activity was reduced from 72 to 36 mN m-1 in a 1-h period (Fig. 3A). A similar decrease was observed at 30 μg ml-1, but in this case it took 90 min to reach this surface tension. Reduction in the water surface tension was accompanied with the formation of a rigid protein film, as was shown by sucking back the water droplet into the syringe (Fig. 3C). Taken together, the Rep1-1 peptide self-assembles into a rigid highly surface-active protein membrane at the water-air interface.FIGURE 3Rep1-1 (100 μg ml-1) forms a highly surface-active protein film at the water-air interface. A, temporal reduction of the water surface tension of the aqueous Rep1-1 solution. B, reduction of the water surface tension is accompanied by a change of the shape of the hanging droplet. C, a protein film remains attached to the tip of a syringe after sucking back the aqueous solution into the pipette.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Rep1-1 did not only assemble at the water-air interface, it also aggregated in the aqueous solution, as was shown by the reduction in the amount of soluble peptide as monitored by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4A). The aggregates that had already formed within a 30-min period could be pelleted upon centrifugation and were soluble again in water after trifluoroacetic acid treatment (data not shown). Aggregate formation could be accelerated by shaking, probably explained by creating a large water-air interface (Fig. 4A). Fluorescence of ThT was measured to address whether Rep1-1 forms amyloid-like fibrils upon aggregation. 30 μg ml-1 of Rep1-1 in water was incubated with ThT 30 min after solubilization with or without additional vortexing for 3 min. In both samples an increase in fluorescence at A485 was measured (Fig. 4B). Amyloid fibril formation was also indicated by negative staining. Long fibrils were observed when 3 μl of a solution of 50 μg ml-1 Rep1-1 was dried down on a grid (Fig. 4D). In contrast, a more amorphous structure was observed at 100 μg ml-1 (Fig. 4E). Finally, an amyloid-like nature was indicated by x-ray diffraction (Fig. 4C). Precipitated Rep1-1 showed a diffraction at 4.7 and 10 Å. These diffractions represent the inter-β-strand distance, resulting from the main-chain hydrogen bond, and the intersheet spacing between β-sheets (25Sunde M. Blake C. Adv.

The diffraction at 3.7 Å is also often found in diffraction patterns of amyloids (27Kirschner D.A. Inouye H. Duffy L.K. Sinclair A. Lind M. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In contrast, hydrophobin amyloids could be clearly visualized at the surface of A. niger spores (Fig. 5B). This result could be explained by the absence of amyloid fibrils in vivo or by the high concentration of the repellents in the cell wall (see Fig. 4E). To address this, cells of SG200 were stained with ThT. Yeast cells that had grown in the liquid medium did not stain with ThT (Fig. 6F). In contrast, hyphae that had grown out of the water droplet did stain (Fig. 6B). However, this was also observed with a SG200Δrep1 strain (Fig. 6D). This suggests that other cell wall proteins also form amyloids when exposed to air. Indeed, yeast cells of SG200 and SG200Δrep1 stained with ThT when they were air-dried (data not shown). Because these experiments did not indicate that repellents form amyloid in vivo, rep1 was placed under regulation of the strong constitutive Otef promoter in vector pMF3c-OR. Formation of hydrophobic aerial hyphae was restored when this vector was introduced in SG200Δrep1, showing that the gene was functionally expressed. In contrast to yeast cells of SG200 (Fig. 6F) or SG200Δrep1 (data not shown) that had been grown in liquid, yeast cells harboring pMF3-OR did stain with ThT (Fig. 6H). Staining correlated with the presence of rep1 mRNA as detected by Northern hybridization (data not shown). Taken together, it is concluded that repellents form amyloid in vivo but that also other cell wall proteins do so when in contact with air.FIGURE 5A, scanning electron microscopy does not reveal rodlets at dikaryotic hyphae of U. maydis that have grown out of a water droplet.

https://openalex.org/W2113823422,"Scapinin, also named phactr3, is an actin and protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) binding protein, which is expressed in the adult brain and some tumor cells. At present, the role(s) of scapinin in the brain and tumors are poorly understood. We show that the RPEL-repeat domain of scapinin, which is responsible for its direct interaction with actin, inhibits actin polymerization in vitro. Next, we established a Hela cell line, where scapinin expression was induced by tetracycline. In these cells, expression of scapinin stimulated cell spreading and motility. Scapinin was colocalized with actin at the edge of spreading cells. To explore the roles of the RPEL-repeat and PP1-binding domains, we expressed wild-type and mutant scapinins as fusion proteins with green fluorescence protein (GFP) in Cos7 cells. Expression of GFP-scapinin (wild type) also stimulated cell spreading, but mutation in the RPEL-repeat domain abolished both the actin binding and the cell spreading activity. PP1-binding deficient mutants strongly induced cell retraction. Long and branched cytoplasmic processes were developed during the cell retraction. These results suggest that scapinin enhances cell spreading and motility through direct interaction with actin and that PP1 plays a regulatory role in scapinin-induced morphological changes."
https://openalex.org/W2005671734,"Adult skeletal muscle accepts ectopic innervation by foreign motor axons only after section of its own nerve, suggesting that the formation of new neuromuscular junctions is promoted by muscle denervation. With the aim to identify new proteins involved in neuromuscular junction formation we performed an mRNA differential display on innervated versus denervated adult rat muscles. We identified transcripts encoding embigin, a transmembrane protein of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) class of cell adhesion molecules to be strongly regulated by the state of innervation. In innervated muscle it is preferentially localized to neuromuscular junctions. Forced overexpression in innervated muscle of a full-length embigin transgene, but not of an embigin fragment lacking the intracellular domain, promotes nerve terminal sprouting and the formation of additional acetylcholine receptor clusters at synaptic sites without affecting terminal Schwann cell number or morphology, and it delays the retraction of terminal sprouts following re-innervation of denervated endplates. Conversely, knockdown of embigin by RNA interference in wild-type muscle accelerates terminal sprout retraction, both by itself and synergistically with deletion of neural cell adhesion molecule. These findings indicate that embigin enhances neural cell adhesion molecule-dependent neuromuscular adhesion and thereby modulates neuromuscular junction formation and plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2005891779,"The endophytic lifestyle has played an important role in the evolution of the morphology of reproductive structures (body) in one of the most problematic groups in fungal classification, the Leotiomycetes (Ascomycota). Mapping fungal morphologies to two groups in the Leiotiomycetes, the Rhytismatales and Hemiphacidiaceae reveals significant divergence in body size, shape and complexity. Mapping ecological roles to these taxa reveals that the groups include endophytic fungi living on leaves and saprobic fungi living on duff or dead wood. Finally, mapping of the morphologies to ecological roles reveals that leaf endophytes produce small, highly reduced fruiting bodies covered with fungal tissue or dead host tissue, while saprobic species produce large and intricate fruiting bodies. Intriguingly, resemblance between asexual conidiomata and sexual ascomata in some leotiomycetes implicates some common developmental pathways for sexual and asexual development in these fungi."
https://openalex.org/W2108643578,"Background Previously, we reported that the “antioxidant” compound “mitoQ” (mitochondrial-targeted ubiquinol/ubiquinone) actually increased superoxide production by bovine aortic endothelial (BAE) cell mitochondria incubated with complex I but not complex II substrates. Methods and Results To further define the site of action of the targeted coenzyme Q compound, we extended these studies to include different substrate and inhibitor conditions. In addition, we assessed the effects of mitoquinone on mitochondrial respiration, measured respiration and mitochondrial membrane potential in intact cells, and tested the intriguing hypothesis that mitoquinone might impart fuel selectivity in intact BAE cells. In mitochondria respiring on differing concentrations of complex I substrates, mitoquinone and rotenone had interactive effects on ROS consistent with redox cycling at multiple sites within complex I. Mitoquinone increased respiration in isolated mitochondria respiring on complex I but not complex II substrates. Mitoquinone also increased oxygen consumption by intact BAE cells. Moreover, when added to intact cells at 50 to 1000 nM, mitoquinone increased glucose oxidation and reduced fat oxidation, at doses that did not alter membrane potential or induce cell toxicity. Although high dose mitoquinone reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, the positively charged mitochondrial-targeted cation, decyltriphenylphosphonium (mitoquinone without the coenzyme Q moiety), decreased membrane potential more than mitoquinone, but did not alter fuel selectivity. Therefore, non-specific effects of the positive charge were not responsible and the quinone moiety is required for altered nutrient selectivity. Conclusions In summary, the interactive effects of mitoquinone and rotenone are consistent with redox cycling at more than one site within complex I. In addition, mitoquinone has substrate dependent effects on mitochondrial respiration, increases repiration by intact cells, and alters fuel selectivity favoring glucose over fatty acid oxidation at the intact cell level."
