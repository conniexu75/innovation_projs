https://openalex.org/W2033286416,Aggregations of ice platelets accumulate below the annual sea ice (subice platelet layer) and on the bottom (anchor ice) to depths of 33 meters. Observations of ice platelets adhering to submerged lines support the conclusion that 33 meters is the lower limit for ice formation in the water column in this area. The rising anchor ice lifts epibenthic fauna and has a pronounced effect on the distribution of the epibenthic organisms.

A common origin and tropospheric transport from continental land masses is suggested."
https://openalex.org/W2014509207,"The regulated activation of numerous sets of genes in multiple chromosomal locations is a hallmark of cellular differentiation in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Certain species of bacteria that experience complex developmental cycles are especially attractive as systems in which to study the mechanisms of this kind of gene regulation because they are highly amenable to both biochemical and genetic approaches. Bacillus subtilis, which undergoes extensive cellular differentiation when it sporulates, is one such system. Many new methods are now available in this Gram-positive species for identifying, manipulating, and studying the regulation of genes involved in spore formation, including the use of transposable genetic elements that create gene fusions in vivo as an automatic consequence of insertions into genes."
https://openalex.org/W1994664490,Mass flow of air to the submerged parts of the plant constitutes the major mechanism of aeration in partially submerged rice. It is proposed that the flow of air results from reduction of pressure in the air-conducting system of the plant caused by consumption of oxygen and solubilization of respiratory carbon dioxide in the surrounding water.
https://openalex.org/W2035138921,Measurements made downwind of a simulated forest fire showed that the concentration of cloud condensation nuclei active at a supersaturation of 1 percent was increased by a factor of about 2.5. Smaller increases were observed at lower supersaturations.

Horsebean should be included in the ensemble of legumes grown by some early Neolithic people. The site, situated near the southwest outlet of Biq'at Bet Netofa, lies in a valley with heavy soil suitable for growing contemporary cultivars of horsebean. The still unknown wild ancestor of the horsebean may have originated in similar habitats in the Levant."
https://openalex.org/W2080121904,"Fossils of the late Pleistocene elk Megaloceros giganteus from Ballybetagh bog, near Dublin, Ireland, indicate that males segregated from females during winters. The segregation implies seasonal rutting and polygynous mating and is consistent with the idea that large antlers functioned for social display. Within male groups, winterkill was the chief cause of death and was highest among juveniles and small adults with small antlers. There is no evidence to support the popular conception that heavy antlers caused animals to drown or become mired."

https://openalex.org/W2091766203,"The use of wild rice during the late prehistoric period is suggested by charred wild rice grains associated with fire hearths and threshing pits in historically known, specialized harvesting sites. Similar wild rice grains imbedded in the clay lining of specialized threshing pits called ""jig pots"" confirms the prehistoric use."
https://openalex.org/W2155034362,"Deterrent B, a compound apparently involved in the resistance of Melilotus infesta to the sweetclover weevil Sitona cylindricollis, has been isolated from leaves by a combination of preparative paper chromatography, sublimation, and crystallization. The compound has been identified as ammonium nitrate. Isolated deterrent B and ammonium nitrate have identical feeding deterrent activities. Although the deterrent principle was isolated as the ammonium salt, nitrate ion is probably responsible for the deterrent activity in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1978888209,"Liver mitochondria from the desert tortoise Gopherus agassizii and the Texas tortoise G. berlandieri contain glutamine synthetase, the enzyme used by birds and higher reptiles to detoxify ammonia generated intramitochondrially during amino acid catabolism. Tortoise mitochondria also contain carbamyl phosphate synthetase-I and ornithine transcarbamylase, the enzymes used by mammals for this purpose. Since chelonid reptiles have changed little since their divergence from the stem reptiles, this finding suggests that both systems were present in the latter before the emergence of the ruling reptile, avian, and mammalian lines of descent."

https://openalex.org/W1974828617,"Terminal velocities of dust particles have been calculated for two model atmospheres of Venus; data are derived from measurements of Mariner V and Venera 4. The vertical wind velocities required to maintain dust aloft in the lower atmosphere of Venus are less than one-half the magnitude of those needed on Earth. Since the lower atmosphere of Venus appears to be hot, dry, and strongly convective, it probably contains much more dust than that of Earth."

https://openalex.org/W1979288870,"A recent report by claims to have obtained experimental evidence from x-ray analysis for bonding electron density between selenium atoms belonging to different molecules of tetramethylselenafulvalene (TMTSF) in the organic metal (TMTSF)/sub 2/AsF/sub 6/. In this article, the experimental data reported by are criticized, and the validity of the data is questioned. Particular attention is given to the electron-density difference maps. It is pointed out that the uncertainties in the x-ray analysis reported are so great that very little confidence can be placed in the details in the difference maps. The authors of the original article, of course, refute the criticisms of Dunitz. They answer each criticism raised by Dunitz and points out that their data agree quite well with that published by another author, Grant. No resolution of the argument has been made in this article. 13 references."
