https://openalex.org/W2073405625,"Seventy-seven percent of the total water discharge of the 139 largest river systems in North America north of Mexico, in Europe, and in the republics of the former Soviet Union is strongly or moderately affected by fragmentation of the river channels by dams and by water regulation resulting from reservoir operation, interbasin diversion, and irrigation. The remaining free-flowing large river systems are relatively small and nearly all situated in the far north, as are the 59 medium-sized river systems of Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Denmark. These conditions indicate that many types of river ecosystems have been lost and that the populations of many riverine species have become highly fragmented. To improve the conservation of biodiversity and the sustainable use of biological resources, immediate action is called for to create an international preservation network of free-flowing river systems and to rehabilitate exploited rivers in areas that lack unaffected watercourses."
https://openalex.org/W2031310854,"Interspecific competition driving divergence in adaptive radiation has not previously been tested experimentally. Natural selection on a morphologically variable species of stickleback fish was contrasted in the presence and absence of a close relative. Selection was nondirectional when the target species was alone, whereas addition of the second species favored individuals most different from it morphologically and ecologically. Disproportionately severe competition between similar phenotypes indicates frequency-dependent selection, verifying a crucial element of theory of competition and character divergence. The findings help resolve outstanding debates on the ecological causes of diversification and the evolutionary consequences of competitive interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2086035298,"An embryonic skeleton of a nonavian theropod dinosaur was found preserved in an egg from Upper Cretaceous rocks in the Gobi Desert of Mongolia. Cranial features identify the embryo as a member of Oviraptoridae. Two embryo-sized skulls of dromaeosaurids, similar to that of Velociraptor, were also recovered in the nest. The eggshell microstructure is similar to that of ratite birds and is of a type common in the Djadokhta Formation at the Flaming Cliffs (Bayn Dzak). Discovery of a nest of such eggs at the Flaming Cliffs in 1923, beneath the Oviraptor philoceratops holotype, suggests that this dinosaur may have been a brooding adult."
https://openalex.org/W2041616107,"A method for the fast measurement of the diffusion coefficients of both small and large molecules in thin capillaries is reported. The method relies on Taylor-Aris dispersion theory and uses standard instrumentation for capillary zone electrophoresis. With this equipment, which consists of thin capillaries (50 to 100 micrometers in inner diameter), an injection system, detector ports, and computer data acquisition, a sample plug is pumped through the capillary at known velocity and the peak dispersion coefficient (D(*)) is measured. With the experimentally measured values of D(*) and flow velocity, and knowledge of the inner diameter of the capillary, the molecular diffusion coefficient (D) can be rapidly derived. For example, for ovalbumin a D value of 0.759 x 10(-6) square centimeter per second is found versus a tabulated value of 0.776 x 10(-6) square centimeter per second (error, 2 percent). For hemoglobin a D value of 0.676 x 10(-6) square centimeter per second is obtained versus a literature value of 0.690 x 10(-6) square centimeter per second (error, 1.5 percent)."
https://openalex.org/W2007230657,"An autumn bloom of sea-ice algae was observed from February to June of 1992 within the upper 0.4 meter of multiyear ice in the Western Weddell Sea, Antarctica. The bloom was reliant on the freezing of porous areas within the ice that initiated a vertical exchange of nutrient-depleted brine with nutrient-rich seawater. This replenishment of nutrients to the algal community allowed the net production of 1760 milligrams of carbon and 200 milligrams of nitrogen per square meter of ice. The location of this autumn bloom is unlike that of spring blooms previously observed in both polar regions."
https://openalex.org/W2086062664,"Viruses have been hypothesized to control blooms of Aureococcus anophagefferens gen. et sp. nov. (Chrysophyceae), a marine phytoplankton that since 1985 has caused devastating summer blooms called ""brown tide."" By means of ultrafiltration methods, viruses specific to this alga were isolated from both the Great South Bay and Peconic Bay systems of Long Island, New York, during the summer bloom period of 1992. Cell lysis of healthy algal cultures was demonstrated, as well as continuing reinfection with serial transfers of cultures. Electron microscope surveys yielded images of phage-like virus particles with tails that could attach to A. anophagefferens cells within minutes of exposure. The isolation and cultivation of this virus highlights the need for further study of viral infection of eukaryotic algae and the potential for a better understanding of algal bloom control by viral infection."
https://openalex.org/W1984640540,"Stress in dense polymer systems is classically viewed as being molecular in character and is based on the entropic spring concept. A description on the atomic level has been developed on the basis of extensive computer simulations. An important new concept is the intrinsic monomer stress (IMS), the individual monomer contribution to the macroscopic stress referred to a local moving coordinate system in which the backbone bonds attached to that monomer are fixed. The IMS is time-independent and, for a given polymer system at fixed density, has the same value in the equilibrium melt, with the melt undergoing stress relaxation, and in the deformed cross-linked system."
https://openalex.org/W2054912048,"Some morphological differences between closely related species living in the same environment have been enhanced by natural selection resulting from competition between the species or the negative effects of interbreeding. These evolutionary changes are known as ecological and reproductive character displacement, respectively. Ecological character displacement, the subject of this article, helps us to understand how complex communities are built up from simpler ones through ecological adjustments of the constituent species. It also may be involved in the late stages in speciation when formerly allopatric populations come together in sympatry. Examples are given from studies of birds in nature and sticklebacks in experiments. There are few cases of ecological character displacement in nature where the evidence is sufficiently strong to demonstrate evolution by natural selection and to rule out alternative explanations of the causes. These have been supplemented by experiments: there is scope and need for more.



Key Concepts: 



Character displacement is a process of evolutionary divergence of coexisting species.




Competition for resources, such as food, is reduced as a result of divergence.




Natural selection causes the evolutionary change.




Closely related species differ in morphology more in sympatry than in allopatry.




Experiments attempt to recreate conditions that are conducive to character displacement in nature.




Solitary species are released from competition and broaden their ecological niches.




Character displacement helps to explain how complex communities of potential competitors develop from simple ones.




Character displacement is one of several types of evolutionary adjustments made by coexisting species.




Its signature should be seen most clearly in young adaptive radiations.




The main question about character displacement is not whether it occurs but how important it is.
