https://openalex.org/W3168935284,"Minimally invasive approaches to detect residual disease after surgery are needed to identify patients with cancer who are at risk for metastatic relapse. Circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) holds promise as a biomarker for molecular residual disease and relapse1. We evaluated outcomes in 581 patients who had undergone surgery and were evaluable for ctDNA from a randomized phase III trial of adjuvant atezolizumab versus observation in operable urothelial cancer. This trial did not reach its efficacy end point in the intention-to-treat population. Here we show that ctDNA testing at the start of therapy (cycle 1 day 1) identified 214 (37%) patients who were positive for ctDNA and who had poor prognosis (observation arm hazard ratio = 6.3 (95% confidence interval: 4.45-8.92); P < 0.0001). Notably, patients who were positive for ctDNA had improved disease-free survival and overall survival in the atezolizumab arm versus the observation arm (disease-free survival hazard ratio = 0.58 (95% confidence interval: 0.43-0.79); P = 0.0024, overall survival hazard ratio = 0.59 (95% confidence interval: 0.41-0.86)). No difference in disease-free survival or overall survival between treatment arms was noted for patients who were negative for ctDNA. The rate of ctDNA clearance at week 6 was higher in the atezolizumab arm (18%) than in the observation arm (4%) (P = 0.0204). Transcriptomic analysis of tumours from patients who were positive for ctDNA revealed higher expression levels of cell-cycle and keratin genes. For patients who were positive for ctDNA and who were treated with atezolizumab, non-relapse was associated with immune response signatures and basal-squamous gene features, whereas relapse was associated with angiogenesis and fibroblast TGFβ signatures. These data suggest that adjuvant atezolizumab may be associated with improved outcomes compared with observation in patients who are positive for ctDNA and who are at a high risk of relapse. These findings, if validated in other settings, would shift approaches to postoperative cancer care."
https://openalex.org/W3171491383,"Macrophages have a key role in shaping the tumour microenvironment (TME), tumour immunity and response to immunotherapy, which makes them an important target for cancer treatment1,2. However, modulating macrophages has proved extremely difficult, as we still lack a complete understanding of the molecular and functional diversity of the tumour macrophage compartment. Macrophages arise from two distinct lineages. Tissue-resident macrophages self-renew locally, independent of adult haematopoiesis3-5, whereas short-lived monocyte-derived macrophages arise from adult haematopoietic stem cells, and accumulate mostly in inflamed lesions1. How these macrophage lineages contribute to the TME and cancer progression remains unclear. To explore the diversity of the macrophage compartment in human non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) lesions, here we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of tumour-associated leukocytes. We identified distinct populations of macrophages that were enriched in human and mouse lung tumours. Using lineage tracing, we discovered that these macrophage populations differ in origin and have a distinct temporal and spatial distribution in the TME. Tissue-resident macrophages accumulate close to tumour cells early during tumour formation to promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition and invasiveness in tumour cells, and they also induce a potent regulatory T cell response that protects tumour cells from adaptive immunity. Depletion of tissue-resident macrophages reduced the numbers and altered the phenotype of regulatory T cells, promoted the accumulation of CD8+ T cells and reduced tumour invasiveness and growth. During tumour growth, tissue-resident macrophages became redistributed at the periphery of the TME, which becomes dominated by monocyte-derived macrophages in both mouse and human NSCLC. This study identifies the contribution of tissue-resident macrophages to early lung cancer and establishes them as a target for the prevention and treatment of early lung cancer lesions."

https://openalex.org/W3169139819,"Hippocampal neurons encode physical variables1–7 such as space1 or auditory frequency6 in cognitive maps8. In addition, functional magnetic resonance imaging studies in humans have shown that the hippocampus can also encode more abstract, learned variables9–11. However, their integration into existing neural representations of physical variables12,13 is unknown. Here, using two-photon calcium imaging, we show that individual neurons in the dorsal hippocampus jointly encode accumulated evidence with spatial position in mice performing a decision-making task in virtual reality14–16. Nonlinear dimensionality reduction13 showed that population activity was well-described by approximately four to six latent variables, which suggests that neural activity is constrained to a low-dimensional manifold. Within this low-dimensional space, both physical and abstract variables were jointly mapped in an orderly manner, creating a geometric representation that we show is similar across mice. The existence of conjoined cognitive maps suggests that the hippocampus performs a general computation—the creation of task-specific low-dimensional manifolds that contain a geometric representation of learned knowledge. The hippocampus geometrically represents both physical location and abstract variables on a neural manifold in mice performing a decision-making task in virtual reality."

https://openalex.org/W3166751781,"The central challenge in building a quantum computer is error correction. Unlike classical bits, which are susceptible to only one type of error, quantum bits (qubits) are susceptible to two types of error, corresponding to flips of the qubit state about the X and Z directions. Although the Heisenberg uncertainty principle precludes simultaneous monitoring of X- and Z-flips on a single qubit, it is possible to encode quantum information in large arrays of entangled qubits that enable accurate monitoring of all errors in the system, provided that the error rate is low1. Another crucial requirement is that errors cannot be correlated. Here we characterize a superconducting multiqubit circuit and find that charge noise in the chip is highly correlated on a length scale over 600 micrometres; moreover, discrete charge jumps are accompanied by a strong transient reduction of qubit energy relaxation time across the millimetre-scale chip. The resulting correlated errors are explained in terms of the charging event and phonon-mediated quasiparticle generation associated with absorption of γ-rays and cosmic-ray muons in the qubit substrate. Robust quantum error correction will require the development of mitigation strategies to protect multiqubit arrays from correlated errors due to particle impacts."
https://openalex.org/W3169794276,"Understanding structural dynamics of biomolecules at the single-molecule level is vital to advancing our knowledge of molecular mechanisms. Currently, there are few techniques that can capture dynamics at the sub-nanometre scale and in physiologically relevant conditions. Atomic force microscopy (AFM)1 has the advantage of analysing unlabelled single molecules in physiological buffer and at ambient temperature and pressure, but its resolution limits the assessment of conformational details of biomolecules2. Here we present localization AFM (LAFM), a technique developed to overcome current resolution limitations. By applying localization image reconstruction algorithms3 to peak positions in high-speed AFM and conventional AFM data, we increase the resolution beyond the limits set by the tip radius, and resolve single amino acid residues on soft protein surfaces in native and dynamic conditions. LAFM enables the calculation of high-resolution maps from either images of many molecules or many images of a single molecule acquired over time, facilitating single-molecule structural analysis. LAFM is a post-acquisition image reconstruction method that can be applied to any biomolecular AFM dataset. A localization algorithm is applied to datasets obtained with conventional and high-speed atomic force microscopy to increase image resolution beyond the limits set by the radius of the tip used."
https://openalex.org/W3171061510,"C9orf72 repeat expansions cause inherited amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)/frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and result in both loss of C9orf72 protein expression and production of potentially toxic RNA and dipeptide repeat proteins. In addition to ALS/FTD, C9orf72 repeat expansions have been reported in a broad array of neurodegenerative syndromes, including Alzheimer's disease. Here we show that C9orf72 deficiency promotes a change in the homeostatic signature in microglia and a transition to an inflammatory state characterized by an enhanced type I IFN signature. Furthermore, C9orf72-depleted microglia trigger age-dependent neuronal defects, in particular enhanced cortical synaptic pruning, leading to altered learning and memory behaviors in mice. Interestingly, C9orf72-deficient microglia promote enhanced synapse loss and neuronal deficits in a mouse model of amyloid accumulation while paradoxically improving plaque clearance. These findings suggest that altered microglial function due to decreased C9orf72 expression directly contributes to neurodegeneration in repeat expansion carriers independent of gain-of-function toxicities."

https://openalex.org/W3167390221,"Many embryonic organs undergo epithelial morphogenesis to form tree-like hierarchical structures. However, it remains unclear what drives the budding and branching of stratified epithelia, such as in the embryonic salivary gland and pancreas. Here, we performed live-organ imaging of mouse embryonic salivary glands at single-cell resolution to reveal that budding morphogenesis is driven by expansion and folding of a distinct epithelial surface cell sheet characterized by strong cell-matrix adhesions and weak cell-cell adhesions. Profiling of single-cell transcriptomes of this epithelium revealed spatial patterns of transcription underlying these cell adhesion differences. We then synthetically reconstituted budding morphogenesis by experimentally suppressing E-cadherin expression and inducing basement membrane formation in 3D spheroid cultures of engineered cells, which required β1-integrin-mediated cell-matrix adhesion for successful budding. Thus, stratified epithelial budding, the key first step of branching morphogenesis, is driven by an overall combination of strong cell-matrix adhesion and weak cell-cell adhesion by peripheral epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W3167154410,"The metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGlus) are involved in the modulation of synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability in the central nervous system1. These receptors probably exist as both homo- and heterodimers that have unique pharmacological and functional properties2–4. Here we report four cryo-electron microscopy structures of the human mGlu subtypes mGlu2 and mGlu7, including inactive mGlu2 and mGlu7 homodimers; mGlu2 homodimer bound to an agonist and a positive allosteric modulator; and inactive mGlu2–mGlu7 heterodimer. We observed a subtype-dependent dimerization mode for these mGlus, as a unique dimer interface that is mediated by helix IV (and that is important for limiting receptor activity) exists only in the inactive mGlu2 structure. The structures provide molecular details of the inter- and intra-subunit conformational changes that are required for receptor activation, which distinguish class C G-protein-coupled receptors from those in classes A and B. Furthermore, our structure and functional studies of the mGlu2–mGlu7 heterodimer suggest that the mGlu7 subunit has a dominant role in controlling dimeric association and G-protein activation in the heterodimer. These insights into mGlu homo- and heterodimers highlight the complex landscape of mGlu dimerization and activation. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of homo- and heterodimers of mGlu2 and mGlu7 provide insights into their dimerization modes and the subunit conformational changes that characterize the activation of these class C G-protein-coupled receptors."
https://openalex.org/W3165986200,"Docosahexaenoic acid is an omega-3 fatty acid that is essential for neurological development and function, and it is supplied to the brain and eyes predominantly from dietary sources1–6. This nutrient is transported across the blood–brain and blood–retina barriers in the form of lysophosphatidylcholine by major facilitator superfamily domain containing 2A (MFSD2A) in a Na+-dependent manner7,8. Here we present the structure of MFSD2A determined using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, which reveals twelve transmembrane helices that are separated into two pseudosymmetric domains. The transporter is in an inward-facing conformation and features a large amphipathic cavity that contains the Na+-binding site and a bound lysolipid substrate, which we confirmed using native mass spectrometry. Together with our functional analyses and molecular dynamics simulations, this structure reveals details of how MFSD2A interacts with substrates and how Na+-dependent conformational changes allow for the release of these substrates into the membrane through a lateral gate. Our work provides insights into the molecular mechanism by which this atypical major facility superfamily transporter mediates the uptake of lysolipids into the brain, and has the potential to aid in the delivery of neurotherapeutic agents. Cryo-electron microscopy and molecular dynamics simulations reveal how MFSD2A transports essential omega-3 fatty acids across the blood–brain and blood–retina barriers as lysolipids."
https://openalex.org/W3172273960,"We previously reported that a single immunization with an adenovirus serotype 26 (Ad26)-vector-based vaccine expressing an optimized SARS-CoV-2 spike (Ad26.COV2.S) protected rhesus macaques against SARS-CoV-2 challenge. To evaluate reduced doses of Ad26.COV2.S, 30 rhesus macaques were immunized once with 1 × 1011, 5 × 1010, 1.125 × 1010, or 2 × 109 viral particles (vp) Ad26.COV2.S or sham and were challenged with SARS-CoV-2. Vaccine doses as low as 2 × 109 vp provided robust protection in bronchoalveolar lavage, whereas doses of 1.125 × 1010 vp were required for protection in nasal swabs. Activated memory B cells and binding or neutralizing antibody titers following vaccination correlated with protective efficacy. At suboptimal vaccine doses, viral breakthrough was observed but did not show enhancement of disease. These data demonstrate that a single immunization with relatively low dose of Ad26.COV2.S effectively protected against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in rhesus macaques, although a higher vaccine dose may be required for protection in the upper respiratory tract."
https://openalex.org/W3168443714,"Red supergiants are the most common final evolutionary stage of stars that have initial masses between 8 and 35 times that of the Sun. During this stage, which lasts roughly 100,000 years1, red supergiants experience substantial mass loss. However, the mechanism for this mass loss is unknown. Mass loss may affect the evolutionary path, collapse and future supernova light curve of a red supergiant, and its ultimate fate as either a neutron star or a black hole. From November 2019 to March 2020, Betelgeuse - the second-closest red supergiant to Earth (roughly 220 parsecs, or 724 light years, away) - experienced a historic dimming of its visible brightness. Usually having an apparent magnitude between 0.1 and 1.0, its visual brightness decreased to 1.614 +/- 0.008 magnitudes around 7-13 February 2020 - an event referred to as Betelgeuse's Great Dimming. Here we report high-angular-resolution observations showing that the southern hemisphere of Betelgeuse was ten times darker than usual in the visible spectrum during its Great Dimming. Observations and modelling support a scenario in which a dust clump formed recently in the vicinity of the star, owing to a local temperature decrease in a cool patch that appeared on the photosphere. The directly imaged brightness variations of Betelgeuse evolved on a timescale of weeks. Our findings suggest that a component of mass loss from red supergiants is inhomogeneous, linked to a very contrasted and rapidly changing photosphere"
https://openalex.org/W3165933613,"Ionotropic glutamate delta receptors 1 (GluD1) and 2 (GluD2) exhibit the molecular architecture of postsynaptic ionotropic glutamate receptors, but assemble into trans-synaptic adhesion complexes by binding to secreted cerebellins that in turn interact with presynaptic neurexins1-4. It is unclear whether neurexin-cerebellin-GluD1/2 assemblies serve an adhesive synapse-formation function or mediate trans-synaptic signalling. Here we show in hippocampal synapses, that binding of presynaptic neurexin-cerebellin complexes to postsynaptic GluD1 controls glutamate receptor activity without affecting synapse numbers. Specifically, neurexin-1-cerebellin-2 and neurexin-3-cerebellin-2 complexes differentially regulate NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors and AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) receptors by activating distinct postsynaptic GluD1 effector signals. Of note, minimal GluD1 and GluD2 constructs containing only their N-terminal cerebellin-binding and C-terminal cytoplasmic domains, joined by an unrelated transmembrane region, fully control the levels of NMDA and AMPA receptors. The distinct signalling specificity of presynaptic neurexin-1 and neurexin-35,6 is encoded by their alternatively spliced splice site 4 sequences, whereas the regulatory functions of postsynaptic GluD1 are mediated by conserved cytoplasmic sequence motifs spanning 5-13 residues. Thus, GluDs are signalling molecules that regulate NMDA and AMPA receptors by an unexpected transduction mechanism that bypasses their ionotropic receptor architecture and directly converts extracellular neurexin-cerebellin signals into postsynaptic receptor responses."
https://openalex.org/W3172770809,"Transcription initiation requires assembly of the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) pre-initiation complex (PIC) and opening of promoter DNA. Here, we present the long-sought high-resolution structure of the yeast PIC and define the mechanism of initial DNA opening. We trap the PIC in an intermediate state that contains half a turn of open DNA located 30-35 base pairs downstream of the TATA box. The initially opened DNA region is flanked and stabilized by the polymerase ""clamp head loop"" and the TFIIF ""charged region"" that both contribute to promoter-initiated transcription. TFIIE facilitates initiation by buttressing the clamp head loop and by regulating the TFIIH translocase. The initial DNA bubble is then extended in the upstream direction, leading to the open promoter complex and enabling start-site scanning and RNA synthesis. This unique mechanism of DNA opening may permit more intricate regulation than in the Pol I and Pol III systems."

Our study delineates a peptidergic pathway mediating sneezing, providing molecular insights into the sneezing reflex arc. Sneezing is a basic reflex that expels irritants and pathogens from the airway. Although designed to be a defense mechanism, sneezing is associated with many viral respiratory infections (e.g., common cold and flu) and allergic rhinitis (a.k.a., hay fever) and severely impacts our quality of life and productivity (Songu and Cingi, 2009Songu M. Cingi C. Sneeze reflex: facts and fiction.Ther. Adv. Respir. Dis. 2009; 3: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Moreover, sneezing represents the most forceful and common mechanism to spread infectious droplets during viral respiratory infections. Studies indicate that a single sneeze can create 40,000 virus-containing droplets that reach a radius of 7 to 8 m and suspend in the air for up to 10 min (Bourouiba, 2016Bourouiba L.

From the perspective of either basic science or clinical medicine, it is of paramount importance to understand the mechanisms underlying sneezing. A sneeze-evoking region was discovered in the ventromedial spinal trigeminal nucleus (SpV) of both cats and humans (Hersch, 2000Hersch M.

Electrical stimulations of this region evoke sneeze-like responses in cats (Nonaka et al., 1990Nonaka S. Unno T. Ohta Y. Mori S. Sneeze-evoking region within the brainstem.Brain Res. 1990; 511: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Stroke-induced lesions on this region lead to paroxysmal sneezing or loss of ability to sneeze in humans (Hersch, 2000Hersch M.

However, the lack of information on the molecular identities of the neurons mediating sneezing in this region and related synaptic pathway impedes further investigation. The sneeze-evoking region corresponds anatomically to the central recipient zone of the ethmoidal nerve that provides sensory branches to the nasal mucosa (Hersch, 2000Hersch M. Loss of ability to sneeze in lateral medullary syndrome.Neurology. 2000; 54: 520-521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Lucier and Egizii, 1986Lucier G.E. Egizii R.

We therefore hypothesize that a specific population of postsynaptic neurons in the sneeze-evoking region mediates the sneezing reflex. Previous studies have shown that stimulation of nasal sensory fibers or ethmoidal nerve triggers sneezing in both cats and humans (Batsel and Lines, 1978Batsel H.L. Lines A.J.

Role of respiratory and non-respiratory neurones in the region of the NTS in the elaboration of the sneeze reflex in cat.Brain Res. 1997; 768: 71-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear which population of nasal sensory neurons initiates the sneezing reflex and which neurotransmitters/neuropeptides in nasal sensory neurons are required for transmitting sneeze signals. Lacking this information greatly impedes the study of the postsynaptic neurons in the sneeze-evoking region and hinders testing our hypothesis. Sneezing is a reflex generated by central respiratory neurons. Nevertheless, the sneeze-evoking region is located within the ventromedial SpV and does not overlap with any reported respiratory centers in the brainstem (Feldman et al., 2013Feldman J.L. Del Negro C.A. Gray P.A. Understanding the rhythm of breathing: so near, yet so far.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2013; 75: 423-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). It is therefore reasonable to speculate that the sneeze-evoking region further projects to central respiratory groups. Studies have characterized sneeze-related electrical activities in different groups of central respiratory neurons in cats (Batsel and Lines, 1978Batsel H.L. Lines A.J. Discharge of respiratory neurons in sneezes resulting from ethmoidal nerve stimulation.Exp. Neurol. 1978; 58: 410-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar; Jakus et al., 1985Jakus J. Tomori Z.

Role of respiratory and non-respiratory neurones in the region of the NTS in the elaboration of the sneeze reflex in cat.Brain Res. 1997; 768: 71-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). As sneezes interrupt the normal pattern of respiration, whether these electrical activities are the “drivers” or “passengers” of sneezing and whether they are induced by inputs from the sneeze-evoking region remain unknown. In this study, we reveal the molecular identities of the neurons mediating sneezing in the sneeze-evoking region and delineate their anatomical and functional connections with central respiratory neurons. We developed a two-step reverse screening strategy to identify the neuronal population essential for sneezing in the sneeze-evoking region. First, we screened all major presynaptic neurotransmitters/neuropeptides released by nasal sensory neurons for sneeze signaling and identified the neuropeptide that is critically required for transmitting sneeze signals. Second, we targeted the corresponding postsynaptic neurons in the sneeze-evoking region, and studied their role in mediating sneezing. This strategy successfully helped us identify a highly restricted neuronal population that is key for the sneezing reflex in the sneeze-evoking region. To further determine which populations of respiratory neurons are the projection target(s) of the sneeze-evoking region, we conducted neuronal tracing, electrophysiology recording, and behavioral studies. These studies reveal that the caudal ventral respiratory group (cVRG) is a direct projection target of the sneeze-evoking region and drives the generation of sneezes. Collectively, we delineate the peptidergic pathway from nasal sensory neurons to central respiratory neurons that mediates the sneezing reflex. This newly defined pathway greatly advances our understanding of the neural mechanism underlying the sneezing reflex and has important implications in the development of therapeutic strategies for pathological sneezing. Sneezing is characterized by convulsive expulsion of air and the sound “achoo” in humans. However, most previous studies used anesthetized or decerebrate cats that could not make real sneezes and monitored fictive sneezing represented by diaphragmatic and intercostal muscle activities and related nerve activity (Batsel and Lines, 1978Batsel H.L.

To study the neural mechanism underlying the sneezing reflex, we established a behavioral model in freely moving mice. Studies have shown that capsaicin (a pungent compound from chili pepper) and histamine elicit sneezes in humans (Doyle et al., 1990Doyle W.J. Boehm S. Skoner D.P.

Nasal challenge with serotonin and histamine in normal persons.Allergy. 1985; 40: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). By delivering aerosolized droplets containing capsaicin or histamine via a nebulizer to the mouse test chambers, we found that both compounds triggered sneeze-like responses in mice (Figures 1A and 1B ). Specifically, the audio recording revealed sneeze-like episodes characterized by audio peaks, which comprise both sonic and ultrasonic components and are distinct from nociception-associated vocalization (Figures 1A and S1; Video S1). Whole-body plethysmography (WBP) showed repetitive sneeze-like respiratory patterns characterized by forceful and convulsive expiration (Figure 1A). The respiratory patterns and audio peaks correlate well, as revealed by simultaneous WBP and audio recordings (Figure 1A; Table S1; Video S2). To confirm that the audio and respiratory responses are sneezes and not other respiratory reflexes, we examined whether these responses are mediated by sensory fibers innervating the nasal mucosa rather than those in the trachea, lung, or other sites. The anterior ethmoidal nerve (AEN) provides sensory branches to the nasal mucosa and plays an essential role in triggering sneezes (Batsel and Lines, 1978Batsel H.L. Lines A.J.

After transecting AEN, we found that the audio- and respiratory responses to both capsaicin and histamine were significantly reduced compared with the sham surgery group (Figure 1B), confirming that these responses are sneezes mediated by nasal sensory fibers.Figure S1Characterization of sneeze sound in mice, related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Nociception-associated vocalization was observed in 29.2% of mice (7 out of 24 mice) that received a painful tail snip.

Video recording showing the simultaneous WBP and audio recordings of mouse sneezing responses to capsaicin, related to Figure 1 Convulsive expulsion of air and associated sound are generated by sudden and involuntary muscular movements during sneezing. By conducting electromyography (EMG) recording of the diaphragm and external oblique abdominus of lightly anesthetized mice, we observed sudden and involuntary muscular movements upon nasal challenge of capsaicin (Figure 1C), consistent with sneezing-related muscular movement in cats (Nonaka et al., 1990Nonaka S. Unno T. Ohta Y. Mori S. Sneeze-evoking region within the brainstem.Brain Res. 1990; 511: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar; Satoh et al., 1998Satoh I. Shiba K. Kobayashi N. Nakajima Y. Konno A. Upper airway motor outputs during sneezing and coughing in decerebrate cats.Neurosci. Res. 1998; 32: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To confirm that the recorded muscular movements faithfully reflect sneezing in mice, we ablated nasal sensory fibers that express Trpv1, a capsaicin-sensitive cation channel. This ablation abolished capsaicin-induced muscular movements, as revealed by EMG (Figure 1D). These results confirm that the recorded muscular movements are triggered by nasal sensory fibers and faithfully reflect sneezing, but not other respiratory responses (e.g., coughing mediated by sensory fibers in the lower airway), in mice. In addition to muscular movement, nasal secretion is also significantly increased after capsaicin-induced sneezing (Figure 1E). Together, our studies firmly establish the mouse sneezing model. Sensory neurons are highly heterogeneous and can be grossly classified into two groups, myelinated large-diameter neurons that detect innocuous stimuli (e.g., light touch) and thinly myelinated or unmyelinated small-diameter neurons that detect noxious stimuli. To screen the presynaptic neurotransmitters/neuropeptides essential for sneeze signaling in an efficient and precise manner, we first sought to determine which group of sensory neurons mediates sneezing. As sneezes can be readily elicited by capsaicin and histamine in humans and mice (see Figure 1) (Doyle et al., 1990Doyle W.J. Boehm S. Skoner D.P.

Nasal challenge with serotonin and histamine in normal persons.Allergy. 1985; 40: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we examined the nasal innervation of sensory neurons that express Trpv1, the capsaicin-sensitive cation channel that also serves as the downstream transduction channel of histamine H1r receptor (Caterina et al., 1997Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D.

Neurosci. 2007; 27: 2331-2337Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Trpv1 is expressed by many thinly myelinated or unmyelinated small-diameter neurons. Utilizing Trpv1PLAP/+ reporter line (Cavanaugh et al., 2011Cavanaugh D.J. Chesler A.T. Jackson A.C. Sigal Y.M. Yamanaka H. Grant R. O’Donnell D. Nicoll R.A. Shah N.M. Julius D. Basbaum A.I. Trpv1 reporter mice reveal highly restricted brain distribution and functional expression in arteriolar smooth muscle cells.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 5067-5077Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), we found that Trpv1+ sensory fibers richly innervate the nasal mucosa and comprise a major population of nasal sensory fibers (Figures 2A and 2B ). To study the role of Trpv1+ small-diameter neurons in triggering sneezes, we instilled a small volume (2 μL) of resiniferatoxin (RTX) solution into the mouse nasal cavity to ablate Trpv1+ nasal sensory fibers (Figure 2C) (Karai et al., 2004Karai L. Brown D.C. Mannes A.J. Connelly S.T. Brown J. Gandal M. Wellisch O.M. Neubert J.K. Olah Z. Iadarola M.J. Deletion of vanilloid receptor 1-expressing primary afferent neurons for pain control.J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 1344-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). After RTX treatment, audio and respiratory recordings revealed a significant reduction in the sneezing responses to capsaicin and histamine (Figures 2D and 2E). Furthermore, allergy-associated sneezing was also significantly reduced by desensitization of Trpv1+ nasal afferent fibers (Figure 2F). These results reveal the central role of Trpv1+ small-diameter neurons in mediating sneezing induced by both chemical irritants and allergens. The identification of Trpv1+ nasal small-diameter sensory neurons in eliciting sneezing allows for targeted screening of neurotransmitters/neuropeptides essential for signaling sneezing. First, we investigated which neurotransmitters and neuropeptides are expressed in Trpv1+ nasal small-diameter neurons. Among all major neurotransmitters/neuropeptides identified in primary sensory neurons, Trpv1+ nasal sensory neurons selectively express vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (Vglut2), neuropeptides substance P (Tac1), CGRP (Calca), and neuromedin B (NMB; Nmb) as revealed by single-cell RT-PCR (Figure 3A). Second, we studied which neurotransmitters/neuropeptides are required for transmitting sneeze signals by examining the sneezing responses of mice deficient in each neurotransmitter or neuropeptide. Trpv1Cre/+;Vglut2F/F conditional knockout mice failed to show a significant reduction in their sneezing responses to capsaicin compared with control littermates (Figure 3B), indicating that Vglut2-dependent glutamate signaling is dispensable for signaling sneezing. Furthermore, deficiency in the neuropeptide substance P or CGRP did not affect the sneezing responses either (Figures 3C and 3D). Interestingly, deficiency in the neuropeptide NMB significantly reduced the sneezing responses to capsaicin (Figure 3E), without altering other respiratory parameters examined (Figure S2). NMB deficiency also resulted in an abolishment of sneezing responses to histamine (Figure 3E), one of principal mast cell mediators in allergic rhinitis (Uzzaman and Story, 2012Uzzaman A. Story R. Chapter 5: Allergic rhinitis.Allergy Asthma Proc. 2012; 33: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition to histamine, mast cells release many other mediators, including serotonin and various neuropeptides (Kushnir-Sukhov et al., 2007Kushnir-Sukhov N.M. Brown J.M. Wu Y. Kirshenbaum A. Metcalfe D.D. Human mast cells are capable of serotonin synthesis and release.J. Allergy Clin.

Agonists of the MAS-related gene (Mrgs) orphan receptors as novel mediators of mast cell-sensory nerve interactions.J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 2251-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, the role of histamine-independent pathways in mediating sneezing remains poorly defined. We found that serotonin induces significant sneezing in mice (Figure 3F), correlating well with studies showing that serotonin induces sneezing in humans (Tønnesen and Mygind, 1985Tønnesen P. Mygind N. Nasal challenge with serotonin and histamine in normal persons.Allergy. 1985; 40: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Importantly, this sneezing response was abolished in Nmb-deficient mice (Figure 3F). Besides serotonin, neuropeptide FF (NPFF) is released from mast cells upon degranulation as shown by our previous study (Lee et al., 2008Lee M.G. Dong X. Liu Q. Patel K.N. Choi O.H. Vonakis B. Undem B.J. Agonists of the MAS-related gene (Mrgs) orphan receptors as novel mediators of mast cell-sensory nerve interactions.J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 2251-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Although NPFF has never been implicated in allergic sneezing, we found that NPFF induces significant sneezing responses in wild-type (WT) mice, but not Nmb−/− mice (Figure 3G). These results reveal the essential role of NMB peptide in signaling both histamine-dependent and independent sneezing responses and suggest its involvement in allergic sneezing. Further study indeed showed that NMB deficiency resulted in an abolishment of sneezing responses to mast-cell-dependent allergy (Figures 3H and"
https://openalex.org/W3171491188,"Abstract Despite recent efforts to advance spintronics devices and quantum information technology using materials with non-trivial topological properties, three key challenges are still unresolved 1–9 . First, the identification of topological band degeneracies that are generically rather than accidentally located at the Fermi level. Second, the ability to easily control such topological degeneracies. And third, the identification of generic topological degeneracies in large, multisheeted Fermi surfaces. By combining de Haas–van Alphen spectroscopy with density functional theory and band-topology calculations, here we show that the non-symmorphic symmetries 10–17 in chiral, ferromagnetic manganese silicide (MnSi) generate nodal planes (NPs) 11,12 , which enforce topological protectorates (TPs) with substantial Berry curvatures at the intersection of the NPs with the Fermi surface (FS) regardless of the complexity of the FS. We predict that these TPs will be accompanied by sizeable Fermi arcs subject to the direction of the magnetization. Deriving the symmetry conditions underlying topological NPs, we show that the 1,651 magnetic space groups comprise 7 grey groups and 26 black-and-white groups with topological NPs, including the space group of ferromagnetic MnSi. Thus, the identification of symmetry-enforced TPs, which can be controlled with a magnetic field, on the FS of MnSi suggests the existence of similar properties—amenable for technological exploitation—in a large number of materials."

https://openalex.org/W3171011108,"Natural succession of vegetation on abandoned farmland provides opportunities for passive rewilding to re-establish native woodlands, but in Western Europe the patterns and outcomes of vegetation colonisation are poorly known. We combine time series of field surveys and remote sensing (lidar and photogrammetry) to study woodland development on two farmland fields in England over 24 and 59 years respectively: the New Wilderness (2.1 ha) abandoned in 1996, and the Old Wilderness (3.9 ha) abandoned in 1961, both adjacent to ancient woodland. Woody vegetation colonisation of the New Wilderness was rapid, with 86% vegetation cover averaging 2.9 m tall after 23 years post-abandonment. The Old Wilderness had 100% woody cover averaging 13.1 m tall after 53 years, with an overstorey tree-canopy (≥ 8 m tall) covering 91%. By this stage, the structural characteristics of the Old Wilderness were approaching those of neighbouring ancient woodlands. The woody species composition of both Wildernesses differed from ancient woodland, being dominated by animal-dispersed pedunculate oak Quercus robur and berry-bearing shrubs. Tree colonisation was spatially clustered, with wind-dispersed common ash Fraxinus excelsior mostly occurring near seed sources in adjacent woodland and hedgerows, and clusters of oaks probably resulting from acorn hoarding by birds and rodents. After 24 years the density of live trees in the New Wilderness was 132/ha (57% oak), with 390/ha (52% oak) in the Old Wilderness after 59 years; deadwood accounted for 8% of tree stems in the former and 14% in the latter. Passive rewilding of these 'Wilderness' sites shows that closed-canopy woodland readily re-established on abandoned farmland close to existing woodland, it was resilient to the presence of herbivores and variable weather, and approached the height structure of older woods within approximately 50 years. This study provides valuable long-term reference data in temperate Europe, helping to inform predictions of the potential outcomes of widespread abandonment of agricultural land in this region."

Both the motor strategies and neural representations employed could depend on the subject's goals. We developed a shape discrimination task that challenged head-fixed mice to discriminate concave from convex shapes. Behavioral decoding revealed that mice did this by comparing contacts across whiskers. In contrast, a separate group of mice performing a shape detection task simply summed up contacts over whiskers. We recorded populations of neurons in the barrel cortex, which processes whisker input, and found that individual neurons across the cortical layers encoded touch, whisker motion, and task-related signals. Sensory representations were task-specific: during shape discrimination, but not detection, neurons responded most to behaviorally relevant whiskers, overriding somatotopy. Thus, sensory cortex employs task-specific representations compatible with behaviorally relevant computations."
https://openalex.org/W3171255197,"Based on 550 metal analyses, this study sheds decisive light on how the Nordic Bronze Age was founded on metal imports from shifting ore sources associated with altered trade routes. On-and-off presence of copper characterised the Neolithic. At 2100–2000 BC, a continuous rise in the flow of metals to southern Scandinavia begins. First to arrive via the central German Únětician hubs was high-impurity metal from the Austrian Inn Valley and Slovakia; this was complemented by high-tin British metal, enabling early local production of tin bronzes. Increased metal use locally fuelled the leadership competitions visible in the metal-led material culture. The Únětice downfall c.1600 BC resulted for a short period in a raw materials shortage, visible in the reuse of existing stocks, but stimulated direct Nordic access to the Carpathian basin. This new access expedited innovations in metalwork with reliance on chalcopyrite from Slovakia, as well as opening new sources in the eastern Alps, along an eastern route that also conveyed Baltic amber as far as the Aegean. British metal plays a central role during this period. Finally, from c.1500 BC, when British copper imports ceased, the predominance of novel northern Italian copper coincides with the full establishment of the NBA and highlights a western route, connecting the NBA with the southern German Tumulus culture and the first transalpine amber traffic."

The aim of this study was to understand the role of Galectin-9/Tim-3 signaling pathway in the regulation of CD4+ T cell subsets in CLL patients. Flow cytometry results showed that the number of Treg cells obviously increased, and there was a significant Treg/Th17 imbalance in CLL patients. In addition, Tim-3 overexpressed on the surface of Th1 and Treg cells in CLL patients. The levels of Galectin-9 and IL-10 were significantly elevated in patients of CLL, especially in stages of Binet B, and C. However, IFN-γ decreased. Moreover, Galectin-9 in CLL patients was positively correlated with the number of Tim-3+ Treg cells and the level of IL-10. Interestingly, when the Tim-3/Galectin-9 pathway was blocked in vitro, the level of IL-10 in the culture supernatant of CD4+ T was significantly reduced, while the levels of IFN-γ and TNF-α were increased. After co-culture with activated Th1 cells, the apoptosis of CLL cells was significantly increased, and this effect was reversed after treatment with Tim-3+ Tregs. In summary, Galectin-9/Tim-3 are elevated in CLL and associated with disease progression. By the negative regulation of CD4+ T cells, activated Galectin-9/Tim-3 suppresses Th1 effector function and also promotes Treg to be involved in immune escape of CLL. This pathway might become the potential target of immunotherapy in CLL patients."

Most research on parental status and psychosocial characteristics has not effectively distinguished childfree individuals from other non-parents or has relied on non-representative samples. In this study, we use a representative sample of 981 Michigan adults to estimate the prevalence of childfree individuals, to examine how childfree individuals differ from parents and other types of non-parents in life satisfaction, political ideology, and personality, and to examine whether childfree individuals are viewed as an outgroup. We find that over a quarter of Michigan adults identified as childfree. After controlling for demographic characteristics, we find no differences in life satisfaction and limited differences in personality traits between childfree individuals and parents, not-yet-parents, or childless individuals. However, childfree individuals were more liberal than parents, and those who have or want(ed) children felt substantially less warm toward childfree individuals than childfree individuals felt toward each other. Given the prevalence of childfree individuals, the risks of their outgroup status, and their potential role in politics as a uniquely liberal group, it is important for demographic research to distinguish the childfree from others and to better understand these individuals."
https://openalex.org/W3169302563,"About 90% of the Amazon's energy potential remains unexploited, with many large hydroelectric dams yet to be built, so it is important to understand how terrestrial vertebrates are affected by reservoir formation and habitat loss. We investigated the influence of the construction of the Santo Antônio Hydroelectric dam on the Madeira River in southwestern Amazonia on the structure of frog assemblages based on samples collected in two years before the dam flooded (pre-stage) and one (post1-stage) and four years (post2-stage) after its construction. We surveyed five 500-ha plot systems three times during each stage; in the pre-stage we sampled 19 plots in low-lying areas that would be flooded by the dam, (from now called flooded pre-stage plots) and 45 plots in terra-firme forest (from now called unflooded pre-stage plots). At the post1-stage we sampled the 45 unflooded plots and in the post2-stage we sampled the remaining 39 unflooded plots. We detected frogs by active visual and acoustic searches standardized by both time and sampling area. Few species recorded in the pre-stage flooded plots were not found in the pre-stage unflooded plots or in stages after flooding. However, the composition of frog assemblages based on relative densities in flooded pre-stage plots did not re-establish in plots on the new river margins. In unflooded areas, frog assemblages were distinct among the flooding stages with no tendency to return to the original assemblage compositions even four years after the dam was filled. For the areas that were not flooded, there was an increase in species richness in 82% of the plots between the surveys before dam construction and the first surveys after dam completion, and 65% between the pre-stage and surveys four years after dam completion. Lack of understanding by the controlling authorities of the long-term effects of landscape changes, such as water-table rises, means that studies covering appropriate periods post construction are not required in legislation, but the data from Santo Antônio indicate that changes due to dam construction are either long-term or difficult to distinguish from natural fluctuations. Future environmental-impact studies should follow strict BACI designs."

This study's primary objectives were to explore the effects of cat ownership on the gut microbial diversity and composition of owners. Raw data from the American Gut Project were obtained from the SRA database. A total of 214 Caucasian individuals (111 female) with cats and 214 individuals (111 female) without cats were used in the following analysis. OTU number showed significant alteration in the Cat group and Female_cat group, compared with that of the no cat (NC) group and Female_ NC group, respectively. Compared with the NC group, the microbial phylum Proteobacteria was significantly decreased in the Cat group. The microbial families Alcaligenaceae and Pasteurellaceae were significantly reduced, while Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonadaceae were significantly increased in the Cat group. Fifty metabolic pathways were predicted to be significantly changed in the Cat group. Twenty-one and 13 metabolic pathways were predicted to be significantly changed in the female_cat and male_cat groups, respectively. Moreover, the microbial phylum Cyanobacteria was significantly decreased, while the families Alcaligenaceae, Pseudomonadaceae and Enterobacteriaceae were significantly changed in the normal weight cat group. In addition, 41 and 7 metabolic pathways were predicted to be significantly changed in the normal-weight cat and overweight cat groups, respectively. Therefore, this study demonstrated that cat ownership could influence owners' gut microbiota composition and function, especially in the female group and normal-weight group."
https://openalex.org/W3166354313,"The calcium-/calmodulin dependent serine protein kinase (CASK) belongs to the membrane-associated guanylate kinases (MAGUK) family of proteins. It fulfils several different cellular functions, ranging from acting as a scaffold protein to transcription control, as well as regulation of receptor sorting. CASK functions depend on the interaction with a variety of partners, for example neurexin, liprin-α, Tbr1 and SAP97. So far, it is uncertain how these seemingly unrelated interactions and resulting functions of CASK are regulated. Here, we show that alternative splicing of CASK can guide the binding affinity of CASK isoforms to distinct interaction partners. We report seven different variants of CASK expressed in the fetal human brain. Four out of these variants are not present in the NCBI GenBank database as known human variants. Functional analyses showed that alternative splicing affected the affinities of CASK variants for several of the tested interaction partners. Thus, we observed a clear correlation of the presence of one splice insert with poor binding of CASK to SAP97, supported by molecular modelling. The alternative splicing and distinct properties of CASK variants in terms of protein-protein interaction should be taken into consideration for future studies."
https://openalex.org/W3167650853,"On the one hand, sustained β-adrenergic stress is a hallmark of heart failure (HF) and exerts maladaptive cardiac remodelling. On the other hand, acute β-adrenergic stimulation maintains cardiac function under physiological stress. However, it is still incompletely understood to what extent the adaptive component of β-adrenergic signaling contributes to the maintenance of cardiac function during chronic β-adrenergic stress. We developed an experimental catecholamine-based protocol to distinguish adaptive from maladaptive effects. Mice were for 28 days infused with 30 mg/kg body weight/day isoproterenol (ISO) by subcutaneously implanted osmotic minipumps (‘ISO on’). In a second and third group, ISO infusion was stopped after 26 days and the mice were observed for additional two or seven days without further ISO infusion (‘ISO off short’, ‘ISO off long’). In this setup, ‘ISO on’ led to cardiac hypertrophy and slightly improved cardiac contractility. In stark contrast, ‘ISO off’ mice displayed progressive worsening of left ventricular ejection fraction that dropped down below 40%. While fetal and pathological gene expression (increase in Nppa , decrease in Myh6 / Myh7 ratios, increase in Xirp2 ) was not induced in ‘ISO on’, it was activated in ‘ISO off’ mice. After ISO withdrawal, phosphorylation of phospholamban (PLN) at the protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation site Ser-16 dropped down to 20% as compared to only 50% at the Ca 2+ /Calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) phosphorylation site Thr-17 in ‘ISO off’ mice. PKA-dependent cardioprotective production of the N-terminal proteolytic product of histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4-NT) was reduced in ‘ISO off’ as compared to ‘ISO on’. Taken together, these data indicate that chronic ISO infusion induces besides maladaptive remodelling also adaptive PKA signalling to maintain cardiac function. The use of the ‘ISO on/off’ model will further enable the separation of the underlying adaptive from maladaptive components of β-adrenergic signalling and may help to better define and test therapeutic targets downstream of β-adrenergic receptors."
https://openalex.org/W3166409579,"Neuromuscular junctions (NMJ) regulate cholinergic exocytosis through the M1 and M2 muscarinic acetylcholine autoreceptors (mAChR), involving the crosstalk between receptors and downstream pathways. Protein kinase C (PKC) regulates neurotransmission but how it associates with the mAChRs remains unknown. Here, we investigate whether mAChRs recruit the classical PKCβI and the novel PKCε isoforms and modulate their priming by PDK1, translocation and activity on neurosecretion targets. We show that each M1 and M2 mAChR activates the master kinase PDK1 and promotes a particular priming of the presynaptic PKCβI and ε isoforms. M1 recruits both primed-PKCs to the membrane and promotes Munc18-1, SNAP-25, and MARCKS phosphorylation. In contrast, M2 downregulates PKCε through a PKA-dependent pathway, which inhibits Munc18-1 synthesis and PKC phosphorylation. In summary, our results discover a co-dependent balance between muscarinic autoreceptors which orchestrates the presynaptic PKC and their action on ACh release SNARE-SM mechanism. Altogether, this molecular signaling explains previous functional studies at the NMJ and guide toward potential therapeutic targets."

The safety measurement was the odds ratio of major or clinically relevant bleeding. OR with 95% credibility intervals (95%CrIs) were calculated. Findings were interpreted as associations when the 95%CrIs excluded the null value.Thirty-five RCTs (53787 patients; mean age range, mostly 55-70 years; mean weight range, mostly 55-90 kg; and a higher mean proportion of women than men, around 60%) included the following Anticoagulants categories: fondaparinux, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran, low-molecular-weight heparin, ximelagatran, aspirin, warfarin. Anticoagulants were ranked for effectiveness as follows: fondaparinux (88.89% ± 10.90%), edoxaban (85.87% ± 13.34%), rivaroxaban (86.08% ± 10.23%), apixaban (68.26% ± 10.82%), dabigatran (41.63% ± 12.26%), low-molecular-weight heparin (41.03% ± 9.60%), ximelagatran (37.81% ± 15.87%), aspirin (35.62% ± 20.60%), warfarin (9.89% ± 9.07%), and placebo (4.56% ± 6.37%). Ranking based on clinically relevant bleeding events was as follows: fondaparinux (14.53% ± 15.25%), ximelagatran (18.93% ± 17.49%), rivaroxaban (23.86% ± 15.14%), dabigatran (28.30% ± 14.18%), edoxaban (38.76% ± 24.25%), low-molecular-weight heparin (53.28% ± 8.40%), apixaban (71.81% ± 10.92%), placebo (76.26% ± 14.61%), aspirin (86.32% ± 25.74%), and warfarin (87.95% ± 11.27%). No statistically significant heterogeneity was observed between trials.According to our results, all anticoagulant drugs showed some effectiveness for VTE prophylaxis. Our ranking indicated that fondaparinux and rivaroxaban were safer and more effective than other anticoagulant drugs for patients undergoing THA or TKA."
https://openalex.org/W3171066078,"Insulin glargine is a long-acting analogue of human insulin that has been used to manage hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) for nearly 20 years. Insulin glargine has a relatively constant concentration-time profile that mimics basal levels of insulin and allows for once-daily administration. MYL-1501D is a biosimilar insulin glargine designed to offer greater access of insulin glargine to patients, with comparable efficacy and safety to the marketed reference product. We conducted a comprehensive panel of studies based on a formal analysis of critical quality attributes to characterize the structural and functional properties of MYL-1501D and reference insulin glargine products available in the United States and European Union. MYL-1501D was comprehensively shown to have high similarity to the reference products in terms of protein structure, metabolic activity (both in vitro cell-based assays and in vivo rabbit bioassays), and in vitro cell-based assays for mitogenic activity. The structural analyses demonstrated that the primary protein sequence was identical, and secondary and tertiary structures are similar between the proposed biosimilar and the reference products. Insulin receptor binding affinity and phosphorylation studies also established analytical similarity. MYL-1501D demonstrated high similarity in different metabolic assays of glucose uptake, adipogenesis activity, and inhibition of stimulated lipolysis. Rabbit bioassay studies showed MYL-1501D and EU-approved insulin glargine are highly similar to US-licensed insulin glargine. These product quality studies show high similarity between MYL-1501D and licensed or approved insulin glargine products and suggest the potential of MYL-1501D as an alternative cost-effective treatment option for patients and clinicians."

https://openalex.org/W3173016664,"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is the standard treatment option for patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) at intermediate or high surgical risk. Preexisting right bundle branch block (RBBB) is a strong predictor of new pacemaker implantation (PPM) after TAVI, and previous data indicate a worse short- and long-term outcome of patients. The aim of this study was to investigate whether preexisting RBBB has an effect on the short- and mid-term outcome of patients undergoing TAVI in a German high-volume TAVI center.For the present retrospective analysis, a total of 1,891 patients with native severe AS with successful TAVI without preexisting PPM were included. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality after 30 days and 12 months. Baseline RBBB was present in 190 (10.1%) of cases.Patients with preexisting RBBB had a considerably higher rate of new PPM after TAVI compared with patients without RBBB (87/190 [45.8%] vs. 219/1,701 [12.9%]; p<0.001). RBBB had no impact on all-cause mortality at 30 days (2.1% vs. 2.7%; p = 0.625) and at 12 months (14.4% vs. 13.6%; p = 0.765). Further stratification according to the presence of new PPM showed a difference in mid-term survival rates between the four groups, with the worst outcome for patients without RBBB and new PPM (log rank p = 0.024). However, no difference in mid-term cardiovascular survival was found.Preexisting RBBB is a common finding in patients with severe AS undergoing TAVI and is associated with considerably higher PPM rates but not with worse short- and mid-term outcome."
https://openalex.org/W3166759954,"Greater blood pressure (BP) is associated with greater left ventricular mass indexed to height2.7 (LVMi2.7) in adolescents. This study examined whether greater BP variability and reduced night-time dipping are associated with cardiac remodeling in a general population of adolescents. A cross-sectional analysis was undertaken in 587 UK adolescents (mean age 17.7 years; 43.1% male). BP was measured in a research clinic and using 24-hour ambulatory monitoring. We examined associations (for both systolic and diastolic BP) of: 1) clinic and 24-hour mean BP; 2) measures of 24-hour BP variability: standard deviation weighted for day/night (SDdn), variability independent of the mean (VIM) and average real variability (ARV); and 3) night-time dipping with cardiac structures. Cardiac structures were assessed by echocardiography: 1) LVMi2.7; 2) relative wall thickness (RWT); 3) left atrial diameter indexed to height (LADi) and 4) left ventricular internal diameter in diastole (LVIDD). Higher systolic BP was associated with greater LVMi2.7. Systolic and diastolic BP were associated with greater RWT. Associations were inconsistent for LADi and LVIDD. There was evidence for associations between both greater SDdn and ARV and higher RWT (per 1 SD higher diastolic ARV, mean difference in RWT was 0.13 SDs, 95% CI 0.045 to 0.21); these associations with RWT remained after adjustment for mean BP. There was no consistent evidence of associations between night-time dipping and cardiac structure. Measurement of BP variability, even in adolescents with blood pressure in the physiologic range, might benefit risk of cardiovascular remodeling assessment."

The aim of this study was to assess the self-perceived beliefs of Montenegrin secondary school pupils regarding the acne aggravating and ameliorating factors.This cross-sectional survey of the pupils was conducted during October and November 2020 in four randomly selected public secondary schools in Podgorica, Montenegro. All 500 pupils were asked to fill in a questionnaire that included questions on age, sex, presence of acne, perceived acne aggravating and ameliorating factors, and sources of their information about acne.A total of 500 pupils, 234 (46.8%) boys, and 266 (53.2%) girls, aged 14-17 years, participated in the study. Acne was self-reported in 249 (49.8%) pupils, whereas 251 (50.2%) did not report acne. Factors most often believed to aggravate acne were inadequate face washing (85.0%), hormones (84.0%), sweets (82.0%), greasy food (72.6%), makeup (71.2%), and stress (67.8%). Overall the most prevalent acne ameliorating factors were cosmetic treatment (80.4%), increased water consumption (77.6%), a diet change to a healthier food choice (77.4%), and being on school holidays (62.2%). Girls reported more frequently that genetics, stress, sweets consumption, inadequate face wash, and makeup are acne exacerbating factors, whilst cosmetic treatment, increased water consumption, smoking, and being on school holidays are acne ameliorating factors. Boys more frequently considered the benefit of losing weight. There was no statistically significant difference between pupils with and without acne in perceived factors, except for cosmetic treatment. Those with acne more frequently believed in the benefits of cosmetic treatment.Many adolescents' self-perceived beliefs about factors that aggravate and ameliorate acne are myths and misconceptions without evidence-based justification. More efforts are needed to educate pupils about the acne aggravating and ameliorating factors, its health-related consequences, and the treatment possibilities."
https://openalex.org/W3166005937,"The problem of soil degradation has accentuated over recent decades. Aspects related to soil erosion and its relation to changes in land use as well as anthropogenic influence constitute a topic of great interest. The current study is focused on a soil erosion assessment in relation to land use activities in the Pănăzii Lake catchment area. Fallout radionuclides were used to provide information on soil erosion as well as redistribution rates and patterns. Variations in the sedimentation rate of the lake were also investigated as these reflect periods in which massive erosion events occurred in the lake catchment area. The novelty of this study is the construction of a timescale with regard to the soil erosion events to better understand the relationship between soil erosion and land use activities. In this study, 10 soil profiles and one sediment core from the lake were taken. Soil parameters were determined for each sample. The activities of 210Pb, 137Cs and 226Ra were measured by gamma spectroscopy. For low 210Pb activities, measurements via 210Po using an alpha spectrometer were performed. Soil erosion rates were determined by the 137Cs method and the sedimentation rate calculated by the Constant Rate of Supply (CRS) model. A soil erosion rate of 13.5 t·ha-1·yr-1 was obtained. Three distinct periods could be observed in the evolution of the sedimentation rate. For the first period, between 1880 and 1958, the average deposition rate was 9.2 tons/year, followed by a high deposition period (1960-1991) of 29.6 tons/year and a third period, consisting of the last 30 years, during which the sedimentation rate was 15.7 tons/year. These sedimentation rates fluctuated depending on the main land use activity, which can also be seen in the soil erosion rates that had almost doubled by the time agricultural activities were performed in the area."
https://openalex.org/W3166931598,"Common scab is a potato disease characterized by the formation of scab-like lesions on the surface of potato tubers. The actinobacterium Streptomyces scabiei is the main causal agent of common scab. During infection, this bacterium synthesizes the phytotoxin thaxtomin A which is essential for the production of disease symptoms. While thaxtomin A can activate an atypical programmed cell death in plant cell suspensions, it is possible to gradually habituate plant cells to thaxtomin A to provide resistance to lethal phytotoxin concentrations. Potato 'Russet Burbank' calli were habituated to thaxtomin A to regenerate the somaclone RB9 that produced tubers more resistant to common scab than those obtained from the original cultivar. Compared to the Russet Burbank cultivar, somaclone RB9 generated up to 22% more marketable tubers with an infected tuber area below the 5% threshold. Enhanced resistance was maintained over at least two years of cultivation in the field. However, average size of tubers was significantly reduced in somaclone RB9 compared to the parent cultivar. Small RB9 tubers had a thicker phellem than Russet Burbank tubers, which may contribute to improving resistance to common scab. These results show that thaxtomin A-habituation in potato is efficient to produce somaclones with increased and durable resistance to common scab."
https://openalex.org/W3168406798,"Globally, COPD remains a major cause of disability and death. In the United States alone, it is estimated that approximately 14 million people suffer from the disease. Given the high disease burden and requirement for chronic, long-term medical care associated with COPD, it is essential that new disease modifying agents are developed to complement the symptomatic therapeutics currently available. In the present report, we have identified a potentially novel therapeutic agent through the use of a high throughput screen based on the knowledge that cigarette smoke induces the proteolytic enzyme MMP1 leading to destruction of the lung in COPD. A construct utilizing the cigarette responsive promoter element of MMP-1 was conjugated to a luciferase reporter and utilized in an in vitro assay to screen the NIH Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository to identify putative targets that suppressed luciferase expression in response to cigarette smoke extract (CSE). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors potently inhibited luciferase expression and were further validated. SSRI treatment suppressed MMP-1 production in small airway epithelial cells exposed to (CSE) in vitro as well as in smoke exposed rabbits. In addition, SSRI treatment inhibited inflammatory cytokine production while rescuing cigarette smoke induced downregulation in vivo of the anti-inflammatory lipid transporter ABCA1, previously shown by our laboratory to be lung protective. Importantly, SSRI treatment prevented lung destruction in smoke exposed rabbits as measured by morphometry. These studies support further investigation into SSRIs as a novel therapeutic for COPD may be warranted."

Recurrent BDC has a poor prognosis, and no optimal treatment modality has been established. We therefore analyzed our experience on the survival outcomes of radiation therapy (RT) for recurrent extrahepatic bile duct cancer (EHBDC).We retrospectively analyzed the records of patients with recurrent EHBDC who underwent concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT) or RT alone at our institution between January 2001 and June 2015. Freedom from locoregional progression (FFLP), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were assessed, and univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify the prognostic factors.A total of 76 patients were included in the analysis. The median OS was 16 months and the rates of 2-year FFLP, PFS, and OS were 61%, 25%, and 33%, respectively. Among the evaluable patients, the first site of failure was the locoregional area in 16 patients, distant metastasis in 27, and both sites in 8. On univariate analysis, disease-free interval (p = 0.012) and concurrent chemotherapy (p = 0.040) were found as significant prognostic factors for OS. One patient with CCRT developed a grade 3 hematologic toxicity, and two patients experienced late grade 3 toxicities including duodenal ulcer bleeding and obstruction.RT for recurrent EHBDC showed favorable survival and local control with limited treatment-related toxicities. Considering that the most common pattern of failure was distant metastasis, further studies on the optimal scheme of chemotherapy and RT are warranted."

The nature of HIV/AIDS and malnutrition impacts are interlocked and intensify one another.This study aimed to explore nutrition management challenges among people living with HIV on antiretroviral therapy (ART) in primary health centres in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.We used a hermeneutic (interpretive) phenomenological study design. The study used in-depth interviews to describe lived experiences among adult patients aged 18 and above. We selected the participants purposively until the saturation of the idea reached. We maintained the scientific rigor and trustworthiness by applying credibility, transferability, dependability, and conformability, followed by translation and re-reading of the data has been achieved. The data have been analyzed through inductive thematic analysis assisted by NVIVO version 12 pro software.Nutrition management challenges for HIV patients have been described using six significant themes. The major themes were: acceptance of the disease and the health status; facilitators and barriers to treatment adherence; behavioural changes in eating patterns; experience of food insecurity issues; nutrition knowledge; and support. The themes have explained how patients using ART have been challenged to manage their nutrition ever since their diagnosis. Of all challenges, food insecurity is found to be the core reason for poor nutrition management.We found that many factors in managing their nutrition challenged patients with HIV. There should be an increasing interest in managing food insecurity issues as food insecurity has been strongly related to other factors."
https://openalex.org/W3172924344,"Brain tumor is not most common, but truculent type of cancer. Therefore, correct prediction of its aggressiveness nature at an early stage would influence the treatment strategy. Although several diagnostic methods based on different modalities exist, a pre-operative method for determining tumor malignancy state still remains as an active research area. In this regard, the paper presents a new method for the assessment of tumor grades using conventional MR sequences namely, T1, T1 with contrast enhancement, T2 and FLAIR. The proposed method for tumor gradation is mainly based on feature extraction using multiresolution image analysis and classification using support vector machine. Since the wavelet features of different tumor subregions, obtained from single MR sequence, do not carry equally important information, a wavelet fusion technique is proposed based on the texture information content of each voxel. The concept of texture gradient, used in the proposed algorithm, fuses the wavelet coefficients of the given MR sequences. The feature vector is then derived from the co-occurrence of fused wavelet coefficients. As each wavelet subband contains distinct detail information, a novel concept of multispectral co-occurrence of wavelet coefficients is introduced to capture the spatial correlation among different subbands. It enables to convey more informative features to characterize the tumor type. The effectiveness of the proposed method is analyzed, with respect to six classification performance indices, on BRATS 2012 and BRATS 2014 data sets. The classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and area under curve assessed by the ten-fold cross-validation are 91.3%, 96.8%, 66.7%, 92.4%, 88.4%, and 92.0%, respectively, on real brain MR data."

TSH results were collected from neonatal bloodspot screening data and were below the test cut-off level (15μUI/mL). The TSH test was performed between three and seven days, and the ABR test was performed in the first 28 days of life. The newborns were divided into two groups: Group 1 (n = 35), TSH between 0 and 5μUI/mL, and group 2 (n = 27), TSH between 5 and 15μUI/mL. Data are presented as mean ± SD, median, or percentage, depending on the variable.Wave latency and interpeak interval values for Groups 1 and 2 were as follows: Wave I: 1.8 ± 0.1 and 1.7 ± 0.1; Wave III: 4.4 ± 0.1 and 4.4 ± 0.1; Wave V: 6.9 ± 0.1 and 6.9 ± 0.1; interval I-III: 2.6 ± 0.1 and 2.6 ± 0.1; interval I-V: 5.1 ± 0.1 and 5.1 ± 0.1; interval III-V: 2.4 ± 0.1 and 2.4 ± 0.1.

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 16 participants. The interviews were designed to identify the respondents’ perceptions of obligation to their organisation, and their underlying motivational mindset associating with dual nature of normative commitment The interview findings for the affective-normative commitment dominant and the continuance commitment dominant participants were consistent with normative commitment experienced as either moral imperative or an indebted obligation, depending on the relative levels of affective and continuance commitment. All participants irrespective of their commitment profile noted that they had commitment to multiple foci, however, the alignment between commitment to these various foci differed by commitment profile. The qualitative differences among the commitment profiles indicated that the interaction of the commitment components is more complex than current commitment profile propositions suggest and that further theory development beyond the mindsets associated with continuance commitment and affective-normative commitment dominant profiles is required."
https://openalex.org/W3172470069,"Aim The purpose of the present study was to elucidate the relationship between high-frequency heart rate variability (HF HRV) and continuous daytime sitting time in patients with cardiovascular risk factors such as mild hypertension and/or stable angina pectoris. Background Decreased HF HRV precedes the progression and worsening of cardiovascular diseases. Continuous sitting behavior is a major risk factor for developing metabolic syndrome and is associated with cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, renal failure, sarcopenia and osteoporosis. Risk factors for cardiovascular disease can be affected by continuous daytime sitting behaviors. Design The present study design was a post-hoc comparison. Methods Patients treated at two different primary care clinics from 2014 to 2018 were enrolled in this study (n = 53). We assessed HF HRV and continuous sitting time using 24-hour Holter electrocardiography and an activity meter at baseline and 6 months. HF HRV was calculated during sleep. Results Sitting time had decreased in 22 patients (decreased group) and increased in 31 patients (increased group) after 6 months. The mean patient ages were 73.1 and 72.0 years in the decreased and increased sitting time groups, respectively (p = 0.503). HF HRV during sleep had increased after 6 months in the decreased sitting time group. Compared with the increased group, the decreased group showed significantly higher HF HRV during sleep after 6 months by two-way repeated-measures ANOVA after adjustment for age, sex and change in activity (p = 0.045). Conclusion These results suggest that a decrease in sitting time might induce parasympathetic activity during sleep. Therefore, reducing continuous sitting time during the day might contribute, in part, to improving the prognosis of patients with cardiovascular risk factors not only by avoiding muscle loss but also by providing positive influences on parasympathetic tone during sleep."
