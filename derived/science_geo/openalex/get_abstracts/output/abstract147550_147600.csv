https://openalex.org/W2164518522,"We show that hypomorphic mutations in hMRE11, but not in ATM, are present in certain individuals with an ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder (ATLD). The cellular features resulting from these hMRE11 mutations are similar to those seen in A-T as well as NBS and include hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation, radioresistant DNA synthesis, and abrogation of ATM-dependent events, such as the activation of Jun kinase following exposure to γ irradiation. Although the mutant hMre11 proteins retain some ability to interact with hRad50 and Nbs1, formation of ionizing radiation-induced hMre11 and Nbs1 foci was absent in hMRE11 mutant cells. These data demonstrate that ATM and the hMre11/hRad50/Nbs1 protein complex act in the same DNA damage response pathway and link hMre11 to the complex pathology of A-T."
https://openalex.org/W2080069132,"Oligodendrocyte-specific protein (OSP)/claudin-11 is a recently identified transmembrane protein found in CNS myelin and testis with unknown function. Herein we demonstrate that Osp null mice exhibit both neurological and reproductive deficits: CNS nerve conduction is slowed, hindlimb weakness is conspicuous, and males are sterile. Freeze fracture reveals that tight junction intramembranous strands are absent in CNS myelin and between Sertoli cells of mutant mice. Our results demonstrate that OSP is the mediator of parallel-array tight junction strands and distinguishes this protein from other intrinsic membrane proteins in tight junctions. These novel results provide direct evidence of the pivotal role of the claudin family in generating the paracellular physical barrier of tight junctions necessary for spermatogenesis and normal CNS function."

https://openalex.org/W1971442608,"We identified a novel regulatory loop within Drosophila's circadian clock. A screen for clock-controlled genes recovered vrille (vri), a transcription factor essential for embryonic development. vri is expressed in circadian pacemaker cells in larval and adult brains. vri RNA levels oscillate with a circadian rhythm. Cycling is directly regulated by the transcription factors dCLOCK and CYCLE, which are also required for oscillations of period and timeless RNA. Eliminating the normal vri cycle suppresses period and timeless expression and causes long-period behavioral rhythms and arrhythmicity, indicating that cycling vri is required for a functional Drosophila clock. We also show that dCLOCK and VRI independently regulate levels of a neuropeptide, pigment dispersing factor, which appears to regulate overt behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2102632503,"Quantitative imaging and photobleaching were used to measure ER/Golgi recycling of GFP-tagged Golgi proteins in interphase cells and to monitor the dissolution and reformation of the Golgi during mitosis. In interphase, recycling occurred every 1.5 hr, and blocking ER egress trapped cycling Golgi enzymes in the ER with loss of Golgi structure. In mitosis, when ER export stops, Golgi proteins redistributed into the ER as shown by quantitative imaging in vivo and immuno-EM. Comparison of the mobilities of Golgi proteins and lipids ruled out the persistence of a separate mitotic Golgi vesicle population and supported the idea that all Golgi components are absorbed into the ER. Moreover, reassembly of the Golgi complex after mitosis failed to occur when ER export was blocked. These results demonstrate that in mitosis the Golgi disperses and reforms through the intermediary of the ER, exploiting constitutive recycling pathways. They thus define a novel paradigm for Golgi genesis and inheritance."

https://openalex.org/W2056281513,"Layering and positioning of neurons require Reelin- and Src family-associated mammalian Disabled (mDab1). Cadherin-related neuronal receptor (CNR) genes are expressed in neurons of the cortical layer, but not in Cajal-Retzius cells expressing Reelin. This leads us to hypothesize that CNRs bound to Fyn of the Src family are receptors for Reelin. Herein we confirm the association and colocalization of CNR proteins with Reelin. This binding is blocked by CR-50 antibody against Reelin, as well as by monoclonal antibodies produced against CNRs. Both disturb the signaling pathway from Reelin to mDab1 and the positioning of cortical neurons in vitro. These results strongly suggest that the CNR family proteins are multiple Reelin receptors. In addition, differential conservation of the Reelin-binding domain among terrestrial vertebrates may be pertinent to the diversity or complexity of brains."
https://openalex.org/W2128355570,"The temporal expression patterns of the critical Vibrio cholerae virulence genes, tcpA and ctxA, were determined during infection using a recombinase reporter. TcpA was induced biphasically in two temporally and spatially separable events in the small intestine, whereas ctxA was induced monophasically only after, and remarkably, dependent upon, tcpA expression; however, this dependence was not observed during in vitro growth. The requirements of the virulence regulators, ToxR, TcpP, and ToxT, for expression of tcpA and ctxA were determined and were found to differ significantly during infection versus during growth in vitro. These results illustrate the importance of examining virulence gene expression in the context of bona fide host-pathogen interactions."

This mammalian gene has transforming potential that can be activated by overexpression (1Fakharzadeh S.S. Trusko S.P. George D.L.

Originally identified as a gene amplified and overexpressed in a spontaneously transformed mouse 3T3 cell line (3Cahilly-Snyder L. Yang-Feng T. Francke U. George D.L. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1987; 13: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), MDM2 is now known to be amplified in a variety of human tumors, particularly soft tissue sarcomas (4Oliner J.D. Kinzler K.W.

Additionally, there are several cases reported of tumor cells having an elevated expression of MDM2 that results from mechanisms other than gene amplification, including enhanced translation of MDM2transcripts (8Landers J.E.

The MDM2 gene encodes a key negative regulator of the p53 tumor suppressor protein, and the role of MDM2 overexpression in cell transformation has been attributed, at least in part, to its disruption of the biological activities of p53 (11Piette J. Neel H. Marechal V. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1001-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 12Freedman D.A. Levine A.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1-7PubMed Google Scholar). MDM2 tightly associates with the N-terminal region of the p53 protein, inhibiting the trans-activation and G1 growth arrest functions of p53 (13Momand J. Zambetti G.P. Olson D.C. George D. Levine A.J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1237-1245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2792) Google Scholar, 14Oliner J.D. Pietenpol J.A. Thiagalingam S. Gyuris J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B.

Moreover, binding of MDM2 targets p53 for rapid degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (17Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3720) Google Scholar, 18Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2847) Google Scholar). In recent reports, evidence has been obtained suggesting that MDM2 can function as an E31 ubiquitin ligase and is responsible for targeting both itself, and p53, for degradation (19Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar,20Honda R. Yasuda H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the MDM2 gene itself is a transcriptional target of p53. When activated as a transcription factor, p53 binds to a promoter region within the first intron of theMDM2 gene and up-regulates its expression (21Barak Y. Juven T. Haffner R. Oren M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar, 22Juven T. Barak Y. Zauberman A. George D.L. Oren M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3411-3416PubMed Google Scholar, 23Wu X. Bayle J.H.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2584-2592Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Thus, there is evidence for an autoregulatory feedback loop involving the expression and function of MDM2 and p53 (23Wu X. Bayle J.H. Olson D. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1126-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1642) Google Scholar). Although the best characterized activities of MDM2 concern its functional interactions with p53, MDM2 also associates with other proteins. Some of these include E2F1 (25Martin K. Trouche D. Hagemeier C. Sorensen T.S. La Thangue N.B. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1995; 375: 691-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), pRb (26Xiao Z.X. Chen J. Levine A.J. Modjtahedi N. Xing J. Sellers W.R. Livingston D.M. Nature. 1995; 375: 694-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar), and p300 (27Grossman S.R. Perez M. Kung A.L. Joseph M. Mansur C. Xiao Z.X. Kumar S. Howley P.M.

Such interactions could contribute to the transforming potential of MDM2 or may be concerned with modulating MDM2 function. Recently, a link between MDM2 and yet another tumor suppressor protein, p14ARF (p19ARF in mouse) was identified. An important consequence of complex formation with p14ARF is an abrogation of the ability of MDM2 to mediate p53 degradation and to inhibit the trans-activation function of p53 (28Pomerantz J. Schreiber-Agus N. Liegeois N.J. Silverman A. Alland L. Chin L. Potes J. Chen K. Orlow I. Lee H.W. Cordon-Cardo C. DePinho R.A.

Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). As illustrated by such examples, the identification of novel MDM2-interacting proteins would be expected to offer new clues to understand better the biological activities and/or regulation of the MDM2 oncoprotein. Toward that goal, we sought to identify cellular proteins that physically associate with MDM2. In initiating these studies, we noted that MDM2 contains several conserved structural motifs that likely are important for its biological activities (1Fakharzadeh S.S. Trusko S.P. George D.L. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1565-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). In addition to the N-terminal p53-binding domain, MDM2 has a central acidic domain, a putative nuclear localization signal, and a nuclear export signal. The C-terminal region of the MDM2 protein contains two cysteine-rich elements, classified as a C4 zinc finger domain and a C3HC4 RING finger (31Boddy M.N. Freemont P.S. Borden K.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 198-199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Recent investigations directly implicate certain zinc finger and RING finger domains in mediating protein-protein interactions or the formation of multiprotein complexes (32Borden K.L. Freemont P.S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 33Saurin A.J. Borden K.L. Boddy M.N. Freemont P.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 208-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). To test whether the C-terminal segment of the MDM2 protein, comprising the zinc finger and RING finger motifs, also might participate in complex formation with other proteins, we carried out a yeast two-hybrid screening assay. As described in this report, we have identified an interaction between MDM2 and a structurally related protein, MDMX (34Shvarts A. Steegenga W.T. Riteco N. van Laar T. Dekker P. Bazuine M. van Ham R.C. van der Houven van Oordt W. Hateboer G. van der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5349-5357Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 35Shvarts A. Bazuine M. Dekker P. Ramos Y.F. Steegenga W.T. Merckx G. van Ham R.C. van der Houven van Oordt W. van der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. Genomics. 1997; 43: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that the RING finger domains contained within both of these proteins are necessary to mediate this interaction. Notably, complex formation between MDM2 and MDMX leads to a stabilization of MDM2, resulting in an elevation of steady-state levels of MDM2 protein. MDMX also interferes with MDM2-mediated degradation of p53, resulting in an increase in p53 protein levels. The data presented here suggest a role for MDMX in the regulation of MDM2 expression and have implications for understanding the cellular functions of the MDM2 oncoprotein. A DNA fragment encoding the C-terminal 215 amino acid (aa) residues of human MDM2 was fused in-frame with the yeast GAL4 DNA binding domain in the pBD-GAL4 Cam phagemid vector (Stratagene) to create the hybrid bait protein. A randomly primed cDNA library was constructed in the pAD-GAL4 phagemid (Stratagene) using poly(A)+ RNA isolated from human thymus (CLONTECH). The bait and target plasmids were co-transformed into YRG-2 yeast cells. Colonies with plasmid DNA encoding target proteins that interact with the bait protein are identified by transcription of the HIS3 andlacZ reporter genes integrated into the genome of the yeast host. Approximately 3 × 106 transformants were screened for colonies that would grow on media lacking tryptophan (Trp), leucine (Leu), and histidine (His). To confirm the presence of interacting proteins, positive transformants were assayed for expression of the lacZ reporter gene using an X-gal filter assay for detection of β-galactosidase activity. Typically, blue coloration of colonies appeared within 1–3 h of incubation of the filter in the lacZ/X-gal buffer at 30 °C. To verify further protein-protein interactions, plasmid DNA was rescued from positive colonies and re-transformed into YRG-2 yeast cells with the MDM2 bait plasmid. Nucleotide sequence analysis was carried out to characterize the target DNA of positive colonies. A full-length humanMDMX cDNA fragment encoding aa 1–490 was generated by a random hexamer-primed reverse transcription reaction using human kidney RNA (CLONTECH) followed by PCR using forward and reverse primers containing the first and last coding triplets of the human MDMX cDNA. All nucleotide and aa sequence numbers for MDMX primer design relate to the first ATG coding triplet as number 1 (35Shvarts A. Bazuine M. Dekker P. Ramos Y.F. Steegenga W.T. Merckx G. van Ham R.C. van der Houven van Oordt W. van der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. Genomics. 1997; 43: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The 5′ primer included an XhoI site, and the 3′ primer included a BamHI site for subsequent cloning reactions. This PCR product was cloned into the TOPO PCR 2.1 vector (Invitrogen) to generate the MDMX plasmid termed pCK4; the DNA sequence was verified, and this clone was used as a template to generate additional MDMX constructs, as described below. DNA fragments encoding full-length MDMX andMDMX lacking the C-terminal 59 aa (MDMX without RING) were both cloned into the yeast phagemid vector pAD-GAL4 by including into the oligonucleotide primers 5′ SrfI and 3′ SalI restriction sites. The 5′ and 3′ primers for the full-lengthMDMX construct included sequences representing the first ATG codon and last (stop) codon, respectively. For the MDMX without RING construct, the 5′ primer included sequences for the first ATG codon, and the 3′ primer included MDMX coding sequence up to base pair 1290. For the MDMX-(101–490)-Myc construct, the 5′ primer included the sequences for an internal ATG at aa residue 101, and the 3′ primer included the last (stop) codon of the MDMX cDNA. To generate the MDMX mammalian expression plasmid MDMX-Myc, a C-terminal Myc epitope tag was added to the MDMX coding sequence by using a BamHI-XhoI restriction digest to release the insert from plasmid pCK4; the released insert was subcloned into the pcDNA 3.1(−)Myc His A mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen). An N-terminally Myc-tagged MDMXconstruct was constructed by introducing the sequence of a Myc epitope (5′ GAGGAGCAGAAGTTGATCTCCGAGGAGGATCTCCTC 3′) into theHindIII-BamHI site of the pcDNA 3.1(+) vector (Invitrogen). The full coding region and stop codon of the humanMDMX gene was generated by reverse transcriptase-PCR reactions using human kidney RNA. The 5′ primer included aBamHI site, and the 3′ primer included an XhoI site to facilitate cloning the MDMX sequence in-frame with the Myc tag in the pcDNA 3.1(+) vector. A FLAG epitope tag (5′ CCTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTC 3′) was added to the C terminus ofMDMX by PCR of the MDMX construct pCK4, using 5′ and 3′ PCR primers that included a BamHI restriction site. The PCR product was cloned into the BamHI site of the mammalian expression vector CMV-NeoBam. The MDMX-(1–153)-Myc construct was generated by XhoI-EcoRV digestion of the MDMX-Myc plasmid; the MDMX insert DNA fragment was reinserted directionally into the XhoI-EcoRV site of pcDNA 3.1(−)Myc His A. The MDMX-(1–392)-Myc construct was generated by EcoRI digestion of pCK4; the MDMXinsert DNA fragment was reinserted into the EcoRI site of pcDNA 3.1(−)Myc His B (Invitrogen). The S-MDM2 and p53-SN3 constructs in the CMV-NeoBam mammalian expression vector have been described previously (8Landers J.E. Haines D.S. Strauss III, J.F. George D.L. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2745-2750PubMed Google Scholar, 9Landers J.E. Cassel S.L. George D.L. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3562-3568PubMed Google Scholar). TheMDM2, pBD-GAL4 yeast two-hybrid plasmids termed MDM2 full, MR1, MR2, and MDM2 without p53, were all generated by PCR using the human S-MDM2 construct as a template. The 5′ and 3′ primers included an EcoRI site and SrfI site, respectively, to facilitate cloning into the yeast pBD-GAL4 vector. TheMDM2 sequences within the 5′ PCR primers for MDM2 without p53, MR1, and MR2 started at base pair 306, 828, and 1047, respectively, to generate these N-terminally truncated forms of MDM2. In each case, the 3′ primer included the MDM2 stop codon. The MDM2 without RING yeast plasmid construct was generated by SalI digestion of the MDM2 full plasmid; the digest product was then self-ligated following gel purification. Point mutants of MDM2 or MDMX were generated using the Altered Sites II in vitro mutagenesis system (Promega). Monoclonal antibodies anti-MDM2 IF2 and anti-p53 DO-1 were obtained from Calbiochem. Anti-MDM2 monoclonal antibody 2A10 was a kind gift from Dr. Arnold Levine. Monoclonal antibody anti-Myc 9E10 and rabbit polyclonal antibody to p53 (p53fl393) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology or from Calbiochem. Anti-FLAG M2 and anti-β-actin AC-15 were obtained from Sigma. MDM2 and MDMX-Myc expression constructs were individually transcribed and translated in the presence or absence of [35S]methionine using the T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (TNT; Promega). Following a 2-h incubation at 30 °C, the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide was added to the reactions (100 μg/ml final concentration) that were then incubated for an additional 10 min at room temperature. MDM2 and MDMX-Myc in vitro translation products were combined together and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Following the addition of 450 μl of dilution buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mmNaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 5 mm EDTA) and 1–3 μg of the appropriate antibodies to each binding reaction, the samples were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with mixing. To isolate immunocomplexes, 30 μl of a protein A/protein G-agarose bead mix (Life Technologies, Inc.) was added, and reactions were incubated for another 30 min at 4 °C with mixing. Following this incubation, the beads were pelleted by centrifugation, washed three times in washing buffer (0.7 m NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mmEDTA, pH 8, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8), and one time in phosphate-buffered saline. After washing, pelleted beads were resuspended in 50 μl of SDS sample loading buffer and boiled 5 min. Denatured proteins released into the supernatant were resolved by SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and visualized by exposure to x-ray film after fluorography. H1299 lung adenocarcinoma cells (p53 null) and JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cells (wild-type p53) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. H1299 cell transfections were carried out using the Lipotaxi reagent according to guidelines of the manufacturer (Stratagene) or by a standard calcium phosphate precipitation protocol. In all transfections the total amount of each vector was equalized, as was the total amount of DNA. Approximately 24–48 h post-transfection, the cells were harvested and lysed (1% Nonidet P-40, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, supplemented with the protease inhibitors aprotinin and leupeptin). DNA was transfected into JEG-3 cells using the calcium phosphate precipitation protocol. At 48 h post-transfection, the cells were harvested and lysed. To examine the relative stability of MDM2 protein, H1299 cells were transfected as described above. At 48 h post-transfection, fresh media containing cycloheximide (75 μg/ml final concentration) were added. The cells were harvested at various time points, and cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis. For Northern blot analysis, total cellular RNA from transfected H1299 cells was isolated using RNA Isolator (Genosys). Samples (10 μg) were resolved on formaldehyde-agarose gels and transferred to nitrocellulose as described previously (36Murphy M. Pykett M.J. Harnish P. Zang K.D. George D.L. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 715-722PubMed Google Scholar). Probes were radiolabeled with32P using random primers (Prime-It-II, Stratagene). For immunoprecipitation assays, cell lysates (approximately 1–3 mg of protein) were incubated with 1–3 μg of the appropriate antibody and lysis buffer (final volume, 500 μl) for 1 h at 4 °C with mixing. Following the addition of 40 μl of a protein A/protein G-agarose bead mix, the reactions were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with mixing. The beads were washed twice in RIPA buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate), resuspended in 50 μl of SDS sample loading buffer, and boiled for 5 min. The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). For immunoblotting experiments, 50–75-μg samples of total cellular lysate in SDS loading buffer were separated by 7.5–10% SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis was performed using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To identify cellular proteins that interact with MDM2, a yeast two-hybrid screen was employed. The C-terminal 215 aa of MDM2, including the zinc finger region and the RING finger domain, were fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (BD). As detailed under “Experimental Procedures,” this construct was used as bait to screen a randomly primed human thymus cDNA library that was fused to the GAL4 transcriptional activation domain (AD) (Fig. 1 A). From a screen of approximately 3 × 106 yeast transformants, 47 colonies scored as positive for reporter gene activity (His+LacZ+). Of these, the first eight were chosen for further analysis; all scored positive in secondary screening assays, indicating an interaction with the GAL4 BD-MDM2 fusion protein. DNA sequence analysis revealed that each of the rescued cDNAs from the positive clones were derived from the human MDMX gene (Fig. 1 B). The remaining 39 His+LacZ+ colonies all hybridized positively to a radioactively labeled MDMX probe in colony-lift assays. The MDMX protein was identified in a screen for proteins that bind to the tumor suppressor p53 (34Shvarts A. Steegenga W.T. Riteco N. van Laar T. Dekker P.

Interestingly, it exhibits high structural homology to MDM2. Overall, MDM2 and MDMX exhibit 32.6% amino acid sequence identity; the greatest conservation resides within the N-terminal (50.5%) and C-terminal (31.4%) portions of the two proteins. The N-terminal regions include the p53-binding domains, and the C-terminal regions of these proteins contain the putative metal-binding, zinc finger, and RING finger, domains. As indicated by the results of our yeast two-hybrid screen (Fig. 1), the C-terminal regions of the MDM2 and MDMX proteins likely play an important role in their interaction. In particular, a polypeptide containing only the last 77 aa residues of MDMX, which includes the RING domain, is capable of interaction with MDM2 (Fig. 1 B). For MDM2, a slightly larger polypeptide that includes both the zinc finger and RING finger domains (aa 276–491) is required for interaction with MDMX (Fig. 1 A and Fig. 2 A). The yeast two-hybrid assays were extended to test further the importance of the C-terminal protein domains in the MDMX-MDM2 interaction. The results (Fig. 2) demonstrated that full-length versions of the MDM2 and MDMX proteins can interact in yeast cells. In addition, deletion of the N-terminal p53-binding region, or the central acidic domain, of MDM2 did not interfere with MDM2-MDMX interactions. However, a truncated MDM2 protein, lacking the C-terminal 49 aa residues, failed to interact with MDMX (Fig. 2 A). Deletion of the C-terminal 59 aa residues of MDMX also resulted in a loss of interaction of the two proteins. Evidence suggests that the C-terminal region of MDM2 binds two molecules of zinc in an interleaved fashion (37Lai Z. Freedman D.A. Levine A.J. McLendon G.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17005-17015Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To examine more specifically the role of the RING domain in MDM2-MDMX interaction, we therefore introduced mutations at conserved cysteine residues implicated in this metal ligation. MDM2 proteins containing a single mutation (C441G or C478R) or a double mutation (C438G,C441G or C475Y,C478R) within the RING domain failed to interact with MDMX (Fig. 2 A). Mutation of a threonine residue (T455A) that is located within the RING domain, but does not seem to be involved in metal ligation (37Lai Z. Freedman D.A. Levine A.J. McLendon G.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17005-17015Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), did not disrupt the ability of MDM2 and MDMX to associate (Fig. 2 A). The introduction of either a single mutation (C437G) or a double mutation (C437G,C440G) within the RING domain of MDMX also disrupted interaction with MDM2 (Fig. 2 B). It should be noted that both MDM2 and MDMX proteins containing such point mutations, and those with the C-terminal deletions noted above, still retained the ability to associate with p53 protein in this yeast two-hybrid system (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that the RING finger domain of MDM2 is necessary for interaction with MDMX; in contrast, the RING domain of MDMX likely is both necessary and sufficient for binding to MDM2. Interestingly, we have found no evidence for homo-oligomerization of either the MDMX or MDM2 proteins (data not shown). This result lends additional support to the specificity of the RING-RING interaction between MDM2 and MDMX. The MDM2-MDMX interaction also was detected in a cell-free system. Full-length MDMX, containing a c-Myc epitope tag (MDMX-Myc), and full-length MDM2 were individually produced by translation in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system. The MDMX and MDM2 proteins are very similar in size (85–95 kDa; Fig. 3, lanes 1 and2). Thus, to ensure accurate identification of the proteins, co-immunoprecipitation reactions were carried out following the35S labeling of only one of the proteins per reaction.35S-Labeled MDMX-Myc protein was incubated with unlabeled MDM2 to allow complex formation, and the reactions were immunoprecipitated with anti-MDM2 antibody. The 35S-labeled MDMX-Myc protein is clearly detectable in these immunocomplexes (Fig. 3, lane 3). Consistent results were obtained when35S-labeled MDM2 protein was incubated with unlabeled MDMX-Myc followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc antibody; the presence of 35S-labeled MDM2 in the immunoprecipitates is illustrated in Fig. 3, lane 4. In contrast, there was no evidence for cross-reaction between the anti-MDM2 antibody and MDMX-Myc (Fig. 3, lane 5) or between the anti-Myc antibody and MDM2 (Fig. 3, lane 6). These results suggest that MDM2 and MDMX interact directly. MDM2-MDMX binding was assessed in mammalian cells following transient transfection analysis. Mammalian expression plasmids encoding either a Myc-tagged MDMX protein or MDM2 protein were transfected into H1299 human lung carcinoma cells, either separately or together. Cell extracts were analyzed by IP-Western blot analysis. For the co-transfected cells, immunoprecipitation with anti-MDM2 antibodies, followed by immunoblot analysis using an antibody to the Myc-epitope tag, identified MDMX-Myc bound to MDM2 (Fig. 4, lane 1). The MDMX-Myc protein was detected in these immunocomplexes when the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using two different antibodies to MDM2 (2A10 and IF2), either together (Fig. 4, lane 1) or individually (data not shown). Similarly, when lysates from the co-transfected cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody, Western blot analysis consistently revealed the presence of MDM2 proteins in the immunocomplexes (Fig. 4, lane 6). To examine the association of endogenous MDM2 with transfected MDMX protein, we repeated the IP-Western analyses using JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cells, which have elevated levels of endogenous MDM2 protein (8Landers J.E. Haines D.S. Strauss III, J.F. George D.L. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2745-2750PubMed Google Scholar). The JEG-3 cells were transfected with either a Myc-tagged MDMX expression vector, a FLAG-tagged MDMX expression vector, or with empty vector. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using anti-Myc antibody, anti-FLAG antibody, or a control antibody (anti-rabbit IgG). In these experiments, the interaction of MDMX with endogenous MDM2 was readily detectable. The endogenous MDM2 protein in the JEG-3 cells co-precipitated with MDMX-Myc using the anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 4 B, lane 1) and with MDMX-FLAG using the anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 4 B, lane 3). In control assays where JEG-3 cells were transfected with empty vector alone, MDM2 was not precipitated using anti-Myc, anti-FLAG, or anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Fig. 4 B, lanes 5–7). In summary, these data demonstrate that the MDM2 and MDMX proteins can interact in mammalian cells. During the course of these studies, we noted that co-transfection of theMDM2 and MDMX-myc expression plasmids resulted in a reproducible and significant increase in the steady-state level of MDM2 protein. An example of this can be seen in Fig. 4 A(compare lanes 8 and 9). This result suggested that MDMX may be modulating MDM2 expression. To assess further this possibility, H1299 cells were co-transfected with a constant amount ofMDM2 plasmid and increasing amounts of MDMX-mycplasmid. Steady-state MDM2 prot"

To identify new selenoproteins, we developed a strategy that obviates the need for prior amino acid sequence information. A computational screen was used to scan nucleotide sequence data bases for sequences presenting a potential SECIS secondary structure. The computer-selected hairpins were then assayed in vivo for their functional capacities, and the cDNAs corresponding to the SECIS winners were identified. Four of them encoded novel selenoproteins as confirmed byin vivo experiments. Among these, SelZf1 and SelZf2 share a common domain with mitochondrial thioredoxin reductase-2. The three proteins, however, possess distinct N-terminal domains. We found that another protein, SelX, displays sequence similarity to a protein involved in bacterial pilus formation.

Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1998; 18: 93-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The amino acid selenocysteine is the major biological form of selenium in bacteria and animals. It is found in the active site of selenoproteins and is directly involved in the catalytic reaction. In this regard, the capacity of the selenocysteine selenol group to become ionized at physiological pH, the cysteine thiol group requiring a higher pH, accounts for the higher rate of catalysis of selenoenzymes (2Stadtman T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16257-16260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Seven selenoprotein families have been characterized so far in mammals (3Burk R.F. Hill K.E. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 231-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar): the glutathione peroxidase and thioredoxin reductase families, involved in scavenging reactive oxygen species and maintaining the redox status of the cell; three iodothyronine deiodinases participating in the thyroid hormone metabolism; and last, SelW and SelP, which have not been attributed a function yet. More recently, a 15-kDa selenoprotein of unknown function has been purified (4Gladyshev V.N. Jeang K.T. Wootton J.C. Hatfield D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8910-8915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Selenophosphate synthetase-2, the seventh selenoprotein, is remarkable in that it contains selenocysteine, but is also a key actor in the biosynthesis of this amino acid (5Guimaraes M.J. Peterson D. Vicari A. Cocks B.G. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Ferrick D.A. Kastelein R.A. Bazan J.F. Zlotnik A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15086-15091Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Selenocysteine is encoded by an in-frame UGA codon, implying the existence of a mechanism capable of distinguishing the UGA selenocysteine codon from a translational stop. This process requires, in eukaryotes, the presence of theselenocysteine insertionsequence (SECIS),1 a hairpin residing in the 3′-untranslated region of selenoprotein mRNAs that is essential for readthrough of the UGA selenocysteine codon (6Low S.C. Berry M.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 203-208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Sequence comparisons and structure-function experiments generated a consensus secondary structure model for the SECIS element in which a functional motif could be identified (7Walczak R. Westhof E. Carbon P. Krol A. RNA (N. Y .). 1996; 2: 367-379PubMed Google Scholar, 8Walczak R. Carbon P. Krol A. RNA. 1998; 4: 74-84PubMed Google Scholar). Compelling evidence for the existence of molecular links between selenium deficiencies and biological disorders came from molecular genetics experiments. Targeted disruption of the mouse selenocysteine tRNA gene led to early embryonic lethality, implying that selenoprotein synthesis is essential to mammals (9Bösl M.R. Takaku K. Oshima M. Nishimura S. Taketo M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5531-5534Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Studies carried out on knockout mice lacking the glutathione peroxidase underlined the protective role of selenium against free radicals (10de Haan J.B. Bladier C. Griffiths P. Kelner M. O'Shea R.D.

Nutr. 1998; 18: 93-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Further supporting the biological importance of this trace element, selenium labeling experiments in rats determined the existence of more selenoproteins to be identified and characterized (11Behne D. Kyriakopoulos A. Weiss N.C. Kalckloesch M. Westphal C. Gessner H. Biol. Trace Elem. Res. 1996; 55: 99-110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To undertake this task, we intended here to exploit the mine of information stored in EST data bases. The central question in such a project is how the relevant cDNAs can be retrieved without the knowledge of even a partial protein sequence. To circumvent the obstacle, a strategy was developed based on the absolute requirement of a SECIS element for selenoprotein translation. The finding of such a hairpin in a cDNA should therefore signal the presence of an attached coding sequence. Two assets were exploited to extract new SECIS elements from EST data bases. The first one was the detailed knowledge of the secondary structure of the SECIS element, which is conserved in all known selenoprotein mRNAs. The second one was the utilization of a program capable of detecting potential RNA secondary structures in nucleotide sequence data bases. Combined with molecular biology and in vivo experiments, this approach led to the discovery of four novel selenoproteins using a single RNA element as a structural tag. The search for new SECIS elements was conducted in GenBankTM, sequence-tagged site, and EST data bases with the RNAMOT pattern search program (12Gautheret D. Major F. Cedergren R. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1990; 6: 325-331PubMed Google Scholar, 13Laferriere A. Gautheret D. Cedergren R. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 211-212PubMed Google Scholar) with the descriptor shown in Fig. 1 A. 600,300 3′- and 5′-ESTs were scanned, representing a total of ∼222 × 106nucleotides. 2May 1997 release. Positive hits were aligned with ClustalW (14Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar). The same descriptor run against a randomized sequence of 107 nucleotides (A, T, G, and C frequencies, 25% each) yielded three hits. ORFs and ESTs were identified by BLAST searches (15Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar) in the GenBankTM and EST data bases and aligned with ClustalW. The new SECIS elements were obtained by standard PCR amplification of a human B cell library or of human or mouse genomic DNAs (gifts of S. Elledge, J. L. Mandel, and F. Guillemot, respectively) with oligonucleotides GGGTGATCAGGGGT(N)24 and CGGGGTACCTGGAT(N)24 as the 5′- and 3′-primers, respectively. (N)24 corresponds to 24 nucleotides complementary to the SECIS sequence, including the top 4 base pairs of helix I (see Fig. 1 A). SECIS AA109465 was constructed by nested PCR. The PCR primers introduced a BclI site at the 5′-end and a KpnI at the 3′-end of the SECIS elements in addition to a 4-bp stem below helix I (see Fig. 1 B). To replace the naturally occurring SECIS element in the glutathione peroxidase reporter, the SECIS candidates were introduced in pGHA-BcK at the BclI-KpnI sites (8Walczak R. Carbon P. Krol A. RNA. 1998; 4: 74-84PubMed Google Scholar). This plasmid encodes a triple-HA tag fused in-frame to the N terminus of the glutathione peroxidase coding sequence (8Walczak R. Carbon P. Krol A. RNA. 1998; 4: 74-84PubMed Google Scholar). ESTs corresponding to the functional SECIS elements were identified by querying EST data bases with BLASTN at NCBI. Sequences were aligned with the CAP program (16Huang X. Genomics. 1992; 14: 18-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), producing a contiguous sequence. GenBankTM accession numbers AA180412,AA057045, H44779, and R44842, corresponding to the longest cDNA clones identified for SelN, SelX, SelY, and SelZ, respectively, were purchased from Genome Systems. Longer cDNAs, AF007144 for SelY andR47273 for SelN, were kindly provided by W. Yu and M. M. Y. Waye. A 1333-bp cDNA fragment corresponding to SelX was identified by screening a HeLa oligo(dT) library (a gift of P. Chambon) with a probe spanning positions 1–197 of AA057045. ThisEcoRI-XhoI fragment in pBluescript KS was called pSelX. For SelN, the sequence alignment showed that cDNA R47273overlapped the 5′-most 578 bp of AA180412. R47273 and AA180412 were entirely sequenced and fused by ligation of the 702-bp XbaI fragment of R47273 to XbaI-digested AA180412, yielding pSelN2, a 2742-bp EcoRI-XhoI fragment in pBluescript SK. Another fragment of 2066 bp, overlapping the 1544 bp 5′ to pSelN2, was obtained by screening a HeLa random-primed library (a gift of P. Chambon) with a probe complementary to positions 1–702 of the R47273 XbaI fragment, giving rise to plasmid pSelN3. The 1543-bp XbaI fragment of pSelN3 was inserted into theXbaI-digested plasmid containing AA180412, generating pSelN4. Additional 5′-sequences of pSelN4 were obtained by 5′-Marathon RACE using the human prostate Marathon-Ready cDNA and the Advantage cDNA PCR kit (CLONTECH). The PCR fragment obtained was digested by NotI-EheI, and the resulting 999-bp fragment was ligated to theNotI-EheI-digested pSelN4 plasmid, yielding pSelN, a 3955-bp NotI-XhoI fragment in pBluescript SK. The cDNA R44842 containing the 1505-bpHindIII-NotI fragment in pLafmid BA was entirely sequenced and named pSelZ. Similarly to SelN, additional 5′-sequences were obtained by 5′-Marathon RACE, giving rise to the 1170-bp (M15) and 1150-bp (M19) PCR fragments, different in sequence. Into the blunt-ended HindIII-SmaI-digested pSelZ plasmid was inserted either the 1121-bp SmaI fragment from M19 or the 1141-bp SmaI fragment from M15 to generate pSelZf1 (2021 bp) and pSelZf2 (2041 bp) cDNAs, respectively. The cDNAs coding for the different proteins, either with or lacking the SECIS elements, were inserted into the eukaryotic expression vector pXJ41 (a gift of P. Chambon) under the transcriptional control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. A triple-HA tag was fused in-frame to the N termini of SelX, SelN, and SelZ by incorporating, by site-directed mutagenesis, PstI orHindIII sites into pGHA-BcK, downstream of the HA tag sequence, with oligonucleotide GCTCAGTGCGGCCGCTCGTTCTGCAGTCTGCTGCTCGGCTC or GCTCAGTGCGGCCGCGAAGCTTCTGCTGCTCGGCTC (restriction sites underlined), generating constructs pGHA-BcK+PstI and pGHA-BcK+HindIII, respectively.PstI-StuI digestions of pSelX generated the 1040-bp PstI-StuI fragment that was ligated to the blunt-ended PstI-BglII-digested pGHA-BcK+PstI plasmid to produce pHASelX. Ligation of the 739-bp blunt-ended PstI-HindIII fragment from pSelX to the blunt-ended PstI-BglII-digested pGHA-BcK+PstI plasmid generated pHASelXΔSECIS. The 139-bpEcoRI-HindIII fragment from pGHA-BcK+HindIII was ligated toEcoRI-HindIII-digested pXJ41, resulting in construct pXJ(HA)3. A HindIII restriction site was introduced into pSelN by site-directed mutagenesis with oligonucleotide CGGCCGCCCGGGCAAGCTTACATCAGCCC (HindIII site underlined), with the last T of the site corresponding to the first base of the first codon identified in SelN (position 2 in SelN), yielding pSelN+HindIII.HindIII-KpnI digestion of pSelN+HindIII generated a 3973-bp fragment that was inserted into HindIII-KpnI-cleaved pXJ(HA)3 to generate pHASelN. The 2314-bp blunt-endedHindIII-NheI fragment from pSelN+HindIII was inserted into the blunt-endedHindIII-KpnI-cleaved pXJ(HA)3 vector to generate pHASelNΔSECIS. A BamHI site was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis into pSelZ with oligonucleotide GGCCTGCAGGGATCCCGCTTACCCTC or GCGGCCGCAGGAATGGATCCTCTTTATTTGCATTGC (BamHI sites underlined) at either position 1137 (3′ adjacent to the TAA stop codon) or 1469 (13 bp upstream of the poly(A) tail), respectively. This gave rise to constructs pSelZ-Bamsh and pSelZ-Bamlg, respectively. The 1140- and 1471-bpHindIII-BamHI fragments, arising fromHindIII-BamHI digestions of pSelZ-Bamsh and pSelZ-Bamlg, were subcloned into theHindIII-BglII-digested pXJ(HA)3vector, giving rise to pHASelZ and pHASelZΔSECIS, respectively. COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and 0.1 mg/ml gentamycin according to standard cell culture procedures. Transient transfections were carried out by calcium phosphate precipitation as described (8Walczak R. Carbon P. Krol A. RNA. 1998; 4: 74-84PubMed Google Scholar), with 5 μg of test DNA, 4 μg of selenocysteine tRNA expression vector, and 1 μg of plasmid LacZ-cytomegalovirus as the transfection standard. Sodium selenite (10 nm) was added to the culture medium. Cells were washed after 16 h and harvested 24 h later by scraping. Lysis was carried out by the freeze-thaw procedure in 50 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8). For protein analysis, the lysis buffer was adjusted to 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.9), 12.5 mm MgCl2, 150 mmKCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 0.5% Tween and further incubated on ice for 20 min. The crude cell extract was then centrifuged at 4 °C for 3 min at 13,000 × g to remove cell debris. The supernatant was used for subsequent analysis. For 75Se labeling, 6 μCi of Na275SeO3 (2.5 μCi/μg selenium; University of Missouri Research Reactor) were added to each 100-mm plate 24 h after transfection of the plasmids. Cells were further incubated for 20 h before harvesting. Lysis was as described above. Western blot analysis, normalized to β-galactosidase activities, was performed as described (8Walczak R. Carbon P. Krol A. RNA. 1998; 4: 74-84PubMed Google Scholar). For the glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity assays (8Walczak R. Carbon P. Krol A. RNA. 1998; 4: 74-84PubMed Google Scholar), the HA tag was removed by NotI digestion followed by self-ligation. Prior to GPx activity measurements, β-galactosidase activities were assayed with 5 μl of crude cell extract to normalize the results. Assays were performed in triplicate. The HA-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated by incubating 25 μl of lysis supernatant with 30 μl of anti-HA antibody 12CA5 linked to protein A-Sepharose beads in a total volume of 250 μl of lysis buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The beads were spun down, washed four times in 200 μl of lysis buffer for 15 min, mixed with 20 μl of loading buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 150 mm dithioerythritol, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 0.2% bromphenol blue), heated in boiling water for 3 min, and centrifuged. To scan for sequences that could adopt secondary structures similar to the SECIS element, we developed a computational screen based on the pattern search program RNAMOT (12Gautheret D. Major F. Cedergren R. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1990; 6: 325-331PubMed Google Scholar, 13Laferriere A. Gautheret D. Cedergren R. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 211-212PubMed Google Scholar). An input primary/secondary structure descriptor (Fig. 1 A) for RNAMOT was inferred from sequence comparisons and the SECIS consensus structure experimentally determined at the time of the search (7Walczak R. Westhof E. Carbon P. Krol A. RNA (N. Y .). 1996; 2: 367-379PubMed Google Scholar, 8Walczak R. Carbon P. Krol A. RNA. 1998; 4: 74-84PubMed Google Scholar). To test the validity of the descriptor, RNAMOT was run against the GenBankTM non-redundant data base (109nucleotides at the time), generating 34 different SECIS elements belonging to the then known selenoprotein mRNAs. An additional hit (M35391 in Fig. 1 C) was found in an intron of the human procollagen α2 chain gene. Given its localization, it is not likely to represent a bona fide SECIS element. However, it was retained because it contained all the features of the SECIS consensus structure. Also, a search with an alternative descriptor carrying N instead of B at the top base pair of the non-Watson-Crick quartet led to the discovery of a SECIS element in the 3′-UTR of the selenophosphate synthetase-2 cDNA. This cDNA was characterized earlier, but no SECIS element could be found by the authors (5Guimaraes M.J. Peterson D. Vicari A. Cocks B.G. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Ferrick D.A. Kastelein R.A. Bazan J.F. Zlotnik A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15086-15091Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In a second step, the search was conducted in the GenBankTMEST data base (222 × 106 nucleotides). After discarding ambiguous hits containing one or more undefined nucleotides, RNAMOT found 376 sequences, including 153 mouse, 101 human, 92Brugia malayi, and 30 other animal and plant ESTs. A sequence alignment was performed with ClustalW (14Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar), and we plotted the derived neighbor-joining tree to obtain a clustered representation of the matches. This identified 62 individual sequences that could be classified into three families. One family comprised sequences corresponding to the known SECIS elements; another contained groups of unknown SECIS; and the last one contained orphans represented by one or two ESTs only. RNA sequences carrying several AU or GC repeats, prone to adopt alternative secondary structures by changes in the base pairing register, were rejected because of their low biological significance. The remaining elements were assessed in terms of stabilities. Some sequences were discarded based on their low thermodynamic stabilities due to too many consecutive G·U base pairs, either 5′ to the non-Watson-Crick quartet or below the apical loop. Seventeen SECIS candidates were eventually obtained that met the requirements imposed by the different subscreens and presented the features of the SECIS consensus element. For easy correspondence with the EST sequences, the SECIS elements were called by the accession number of one of their parental ESTs (Fig. 1 C). All the sequences belonged to human or mouse ESTs, except AA109465, which was a member of a family of 92 B. malayi ESTs. Running the program against the GenBankTM sequence-tagged site data base generated nine sequences. Only four of them, accession numbers L18002,Z16689, Z74617, and Z75892 (Fig. 1 C), were successful in the subsequent screens. The last two corresponded to the R16491 and R23284ESTs characterized in the GenBankTM EST data base search. After this first round of selection, 21 SECIS candidates were obtained, comprising 2 cDNAs, 17 ESTs, and 2 sequence-tagged sites. The 21 SECIS candidates were then tested for in vivo function. The SECIS DNAs were obtained by PCR amplification of genomic DNA or cDNA libraries. Concomitant with the PCR amplification and due to the uneven stability of helix I in the different SECIS elements, an identical 4-bp stem was added below helix I in all SECIS elements (Fig. 1 B) in order for the SECIS RNAs to exhibit similar stabilities. GPx being a selenoprotein, its translation requires a functional SECIS element in the 3′-UTR of its mRNA. The SECIS DNA candidates were then introduced separately into the 3′-UTR of a GPx cDNA reporter to replace the residing SECIS element. In this construct, the GPx coding sequence carries an HA tag fused in frame at the N terminus to allow detection of the translated proteins with the anti-HA antibody. Whether or not the SECIS candidates were active could be apprehended by a rapid assay involving COS-7 transfections of the constructs, followed by Western blotting experiments. A functional SECIS candidate should lead to translation of a full-length GPx. In contrast, with an inactive SECIS element, the UGA selenocysteine codon will be recognized as a stop codon, leading to translation of a shortened 9.5-kDa polypeptide. Translation of the mRNA coding for the HA-tagged GPx, carrying its own SECIS, generated a product of ∼27 kDa (Fig. 2 A, lane 2). Construct GPx-mutSECIS had the G·A/A·G to A·G/G·A substitution in the non-Watson-Crick quartet of the SECIS element that impaired its function (8Walczak R. Carbon P. Krol A. RNA. 1998; 4: 74-84PubMed Google Scholar), providing here also minute amounts of GPx (compare lanes 2 and 3). This construct provided the background level. Consistent with earlier observations (8Walczak R. Carbon P. Krol A. RNA. 1998; 4: 74-84PubMed Google Scholar), no 9.5-kDa protein appeared with GPx-mutSECIS, presumably due to the instability of such an unnatural short polypeptide in vivo. Fig. 2 A shows that, among the 21 SECIS tested, only R71722,AA057045, selenophosphate synthetase-2, AA107841, R46598, and R44842could mediate production of a full-length GPx with an efficiency comparable to that of the authentic GPx SECIS (compare with lanes 2 and 3). A seventh element, AA280511 (lane 13), also produced full-length GPx, but with a lower efficiency. Since the active site of GPx contains an essential selenocysteine, measuring the enzymatic activity will attest that this amino acid was effectively incorporated into the protein. After transfection into COS-7 cells of the cDNA constructs carrying the SECIS candidates, GPx activities were assayed from crude cell extracts and compared with that of wild-type GPx (Fig. 2 B, bar 2). As anticipated, no significant activity emanated from GPx-mutSECIS (bar 3). Wild-type or slightly higher than wild-type activities were observed with R71722 (105%), AA057045(110%), and R46598 (∼100%). AA107841, selenophosphate synthetase-2, and R44842 retained 80, 73.5, and 54% of the wild-type activity, respectively. The activity dropped to 20% with AA280511 (bar 13). A correlation between both approaches could be thus established, showing that those SECIS candidates producing full-length GPx also conferred wild-type or significant GPx activity. Synthesis of a full-length, enzymatically active GPx could be obtained with seven of the selected SECIS elements, indicating that they were capable of promoting selenocysteine insertion. Possible explanations for the inactivity of the other candidates will be discussed. In the previous assay, we functionally characterized the selenophosphate synthetase-2 SECIS element of the selenophosphate synthetase mRNA. Next, we sought the open reading frames lying upstream of the remaining new SECIS elements. ESTs physically linked to each SECIS element were searched in the GenBankTM EST data base with BLASTN. The EST sequences collected after an iterative BLASTN search were processed with the CAP program (16Huang X. Genomics. 1992; 14: 18-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) to assemble one contiguous cDNA sequence. The longest cDNAs were obtained and sequenced. The sequence of the cDNA that we found linked to SECISAA280511 revealed that the SECIS element resides in fact on the opposite strand relative to the putative ORF. Yet constituting a potential bona fide SECIS element, we could not identify an ORF in the proper orientation. We found that SECIS elements AA107841and R46598 corresponded to the SECIS elements of selenoprotein mRNAs characterized while our study was underway. Indeed, the sequence of the cDNA linked to SECIS AA107841 was found to be identical to that of the 15-kDa selenoprotein (4Gladyshev V.N. Jeang K.T. Wootton J.C. Hatfield D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8910-8915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The length of the mRNA bearing SECIS R46598, which we call SelY, was estimated to be 6 kilobases by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 3, lanes 7 and 8). This size suggested that it could correspond to the mRNA of type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase, whose coding frame, deprived of the 3′-UTR, was isolated earlier (17Croteau W. Davey J.C. Galton V.A. St-Germain D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 405-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Our cloning and sequencing of SelY cDNA showed that it was identical to the 3′-UTR of type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase (18Buettner C. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33374-33378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Since translation of the cDNA sequences linked to the remaining three SECIS elements, R71722, AA057045, and R44842, showed no homology to known selenoproteins, the cDNAs were termed SelN, SelX, and SelZ, respectively. The sizes of the SelN, SelX, and SelZ mRNAs were estimated by Northern blot analysis to be 4.5, 1.4, and 2.2 kilobases, respectively (Fig. 3). By screening a HeLa oligo(dT) library with a probe complementary to the SelX SECIS DNA, we identified a 1333-bp fragment presumably corresponding to the full-size SelX cDNA. The sequence analysis revealed the existence of a 345-bp-long ORF with an in-frame TGA codon at position 379 (Fig. 4). As expected for a selenoprotein mRNA, its SECIS element effectively resides within the 3′-UTR. Querying EST data bases with BLAST identified a 2231-bp cDNA that was incomplete since the corresponding mRNA was 4.5 kilobases long (Fig. 3). Upstream sequences were thus obtained by screening a HeLa random-primed cDNA library and 5′-Marathon RACE, extending them by 1718 bp. Assembled together, the fragments gave rise to a 3949-bp SelN cDNA, the sequence of which indicated that the reading frame was still open. However, as the 3949-bp SelN cDNA contained a 1414-bp ORF with a characteristic in-frame TGA codon at position 1028, it was used for subsequent analysis. Here also, the SECIS element occurred within the 3′-UTR of the SelN cDNA (Fig. 4). The sequencing of the EST corresponding to SECIS R44842 determined the presence of a 1505-bp cDNA that contained an ORF that obviously extended upstream of the characterized sequence. This cDNA was called SelZ. Additional 5′-sequences were searched by 5′-Marathon RACE. Surprisingly, we obtained two different PCR fragments with different 5′-sequences. Each fragment obtained, added separately to the SelZ cDNA, generated the 2021-bp SelZf1 and 2041-bp SelZf2 cDNAs. The 5′-sequences of these cDNAs differ upstream of positions 520 in SelZf1 and 540 in SelZf2 and are followed by the common SelZ region (Fig. 4). Since the corresponding transcripts are approximately the same size, they could not be distinguished by Northern blot analysis with a probe complementary to the common SelZ sequence (Fig. 3). Putative ATG initiation codons were identified by the presence of upstream sequences homologous to the Kozak consensus sequence (19Kozak M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2482-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) at positions 816 in SelZf1 and 383 in SelZf2. A TGA codon was found in the common region, potentially encoding a selenocysteine at the C-terminal penultimate position in both proteins. For SelZf1 and SelZf2, the SECIS element was localized 250 bp downstream of the putative TAA stop codon (Fig. 4). SelX and SelN were fused at the N terminus to an HA tag, generating constructs HASelX and HASelN, respectively. In SelZf1 and SelZf2, the putative selenocysteine codon resides at the penultimate C-terminal position in a domain common to both proteins. Therefore, only the SelZ common region was epitope-tagged at the N terminus, giving rise to HASelZ. After transfection of the constructs into COS-7 cells, the tag allowed immunodetection by the anti-HA antibody of the proteins contained in the cell extracts, hence evaluation of their sizes. In ΔSECIS constructs, the absence of the SECIS element should convert the UGA selenocysteine to a stop codon, thus producing a shortened polypeptide. Based on the cDNA sequence, HASelX should generate either 17.2- or 15-kDa proteins, according to selenocysteine codon readthrough. Transfection of HASelX indeed"

Animal cell DNA polymerase γ from Drosophila melanogasterwas first shown unequivocally by Wernette and Kaguni (6Wernette C.M. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14764-14770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to consist of two subunits of 125 and 35 kDa in the highly purified fraction. Highly purified DNA polymerase γ from Xenopus laevis contains two subunit of 140 and 50 kDa (7Insdorf N.F. Bogenhagen D.F. J. Biol.

The overexpressed human 140-kDa catalytic subunit contains DNA polymerase, 3′ → 5′ exonuclease, and 5′dRP lyase activities in the absence of the accessory subunit (11Longley M.J. Ropp P.A. Lim S.E.

However, the isolated human DNA polymerase γ catalytic subunit displays salt sensitivity and only modest processivity (11Longley M.J. Ropp P.A. Lim S.E. Copeland W.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10529-10539Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar).The accessory subunit for the Drosophila mitochondrial DNA polymerase has been cloned and shown to encode a polypeptide of 41 kDa (14Wang Y. Farr C.L. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13640-13646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A BLAST search with the Drosophila accessory subunit sequence identified a human homolog encoding a 43-kDa polypeptide in the IMAGE Consortium cDNA collection (14Wang Y. Farr C.L. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13640-13646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Recently, the X. laevis accessory subunit was cloned, overexpressed, and purified from baculoviral infected insect cells (15Carrodeguas J.A. Kobayashi R. Lim S.E. Copeland W.C. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4039-4046Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrated that the recombinant X. laevis accessory subunit both confers processive synthesis to the human DNA polymerase γ catalytic subunit and stimulates polymerase activity on certain substrates (15Carrodeguas J.A. Kobayashi R. Lim S.E. Copeland W.C. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4039-4046Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, through the combined efforts of protein purification and identification of full-length cDNA clones, we identify the HeLa cell accessory subunit to be a 55-kDa polypeptide instead of the reported 43 kDa. Characterization of the human DNA polymerase γ accessory subunit, the influence of this accessory subunit on DNA replication by DNA polymerase γ, and identification of the accessory subunit as the cause of processive DNA synthesis are presented.RESULTSA BLAST search of GenBankTM for homologs to theDrosophila DNA polymerase γ accessory subunit identified a human homolog encoding a putative 43-kDa polypeptide (14Wang Y. Farr C.L. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13640-13646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We obtained the clone (IMAGE Consortium clone number 44673) and amplified the published sequence for expression both in E. coli and in baculovirus-infected insect cells, but full-length p43 was not observed in either system. To mimic in vivo processing of the mitochondrial protein and to enhance solubility, the portion of the cDNA encoding 15 amino acid residues at the N terminus was deleted to remove a presumed mitochondrial targeting sequence. Expression of histidine-tagged, “mature” p43 in E. coli resulted in mostly insoluble protein, and the soluble fraction (∼1%) did not cause the expected stimulation of Hp140 activity on poly(dA)·oligo(dT)12–18 (data not shown). Insoluble Hp43 was purified from inclusion bodies, and the denatured protein was used as antigen for the production of polyclonal antibodies (see “Experimental Procedures”). Previously we described the purification of native, monomeric Hp140 from HeLa cell mitochondria (11Longley M.J. Ropp P.A. Lim S.E. Copeland W.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10529-10539Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and possession of Hp43 antiserum has allowed us to monitor the fate of the native accessory subunit during purification of pol γ from HeLa mitochondrial lysates. Although no detectable immunoreactive species could be identified in mitochondrial lysates (Fraction I) (11Longley M.J. Ropp P.A. Lim S.E. Copeland W.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10529-10539Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), a single immunoreactive 55-kDa band was readily detectable following phosphocellulose (Fraction II) and phenyl-Sepharose (Fraction III) chromatography (data not shown). Although the 55-kDa band co-chromatographed with the Hp140 catalytic subunit over these first two columns, the immunoreactive protein eluted from single-stranded DNA-cellulose at a significantly higher salt concentration than monomeric Hp140 (Fraction IV). Re-examination of DNA polymerase activity across the ssDNA-cellulose profile revealed an additional, cleanly resolved peak of polymerase activity that was coincident with the immunoreactive species. Silver staining and immunoblot analyses clearly identified the second peak as DNA polymerase γ (see below). The inability to express full-length Hp43, the insolubility and inactivity of mature Hp43 both in E. coli and baculovirus, and the identification from a natural source of a cross-reactive species larger than that predicted by the gene sequence led us to reinvestigate the cDNA clone for the human DNA polymerase γ accessory subunit.Based on the existing sequence, polymerase chain reaction primers were designed to amplify a cDNA for the accessory subunit from both human cerebellum and HeLa cell cDNA libraries. Sequencing of these products in both directions revealed a continuous open reading frame of 474 amino acids that predicted a 54.9-kDa product with an N-terminal 12-kDa segment not reported in the original p43 sequence. Resequencing of the entire IMAGE Consortium clone number 44673 confirmed the 5′-extension, and the corrected sequence was submitted to GenBankTM (accession number AF142992). Two additional nucleotides in the new sequence shifted the reading frame for the 5′ portion of the gene and replaced the N-terminal 11 amino acids of the p43 sequence with 124 amino acids, adding 113 amino acid residues to the previously published sequence (14Wang Y. Farr C.L. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13640-13646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Other minor changes included replacement of amino acids TNFTTI with NKLYYN at positions 287–292, Ser to Gly at position 136, and three other missense changes at positions 141, 295, and 306 (using the new amino acid numbers). Thus, the previously identified IMAGE Consortium clone is correct, but sequencing errors predicted an open reading frame that was a 12-kDa N-terminal deletion of the correct sequence (14Wang Y.

Chem. 1997; 272: 13640-13646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).The Hp55 appears to be a basic protein with a calculated isoelectric point of 8.3.

Additionally, these accessory subunits have high homology to Glycyl-tRNA synthetases (15Carrodeguas J.A. Kobayashi R. Lim S.E. Copeland W.C. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4039-4046Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Computer analysis with MitoPlot predicts a mitochondrial targeting sequence with one cleavage site between amino acids 25 and 26.Overexpression and Purification of Hp55The Hp55 cDNA sequence was amplified without the mitochondrial leader sequence and expressed as a histidine-tagged protein in E. coli. The soluble recombinant Hp55 protein was purified to apparent homogeneity by chromatography over Ni-NTA agarose, Sephadex G-25, and MonoS columns as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 1). Elution of Hp55 from MonoS at neutral pH required salt concentration in excess of 0.5 m, suggesting strong positive charges on the surface of the protein. The purified protein lacked detectable 3′ → 5′ and 5′ → 3′ exonuclease activities (“Experimental Procedures”), and ATPase activity could not be detected in the presence or absence of single- or double-stranded DNA as assayed by the method of Hughes and Jiricny (18Hughes M.J. Jiricny J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23876-23882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The Hp55 Accessory Subunit Binds DNA and Confers Tighter DNA Binding to Polymerase γIdentification of a second, distinct peak of HeLa pol γ activity coincident with Hp55 on ssDNA-cellulose prompted us to test the effects of recombinant Hp55 on the DNA binding properties of Hp140 (Fig. 2). For reference, purified Hp140 was applied to a single-stranded DNA-cellulose column, and the enzyme was eluted as expected at the relatively low salt concentration of 0.22 m. Recombinant Hp55 also bound intrinsically to ssDNA-cellulose, eluting at approximately 0.25 m NaCl. However, when an equal molar mixture of the proteins was applied to the column, they were eluted as a single, symmetrical peak at 0.38 m NaCl, and the free forms of both proteins were virtually undetectable. Quantitative conversion indicated that Hp55 and Hp140 were sufficient to form the more tightly binding species of polymerase γ. Analysis of each peak by SDS-PAGE and silver staining confirmed the purity of the substituent proteins and the successful in vitro reconstitution of recombinant human pol γ (Fig. 3 A). The more tightly binding native form of HeLa pol γ is also shown (Fig. 3 A,lane 4), indicating a greater than 75% purity for this preparation after only three chromatographic steps. Immunoblot analysis with antibodies directed against Hp140 or Hp55 discount proteolytic degradation of the proteins and confirm the molecular weight of the native accessory protein (Fig. 3, B and C). The biochemical properties of this native preparation are compared with those of reconstituted pol γ below.FIG. 2Single-stranded DNA-cellulose chromatography of human DNA polymerase γ polypeptides.Purified recombinant Hp140 and Hp55 were resolved on a 1-ml column of single-stranded DNA-cellulose as described (11Longley M.J. Ropp P.A. Lim S.E. Copeland W.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10529-10539Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The absorbance of the column effluent was monitored at 280 nm. Samples included 15.2 μg of Hp55 (solid line), 34.9 μg of Hp140 (dashed line), and 28.8 μg of Hp140 mixed with 12.7 μg of Hp55 (dotted line).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)FIG. 3Comparison of native and recombinant complexes.

The positions of molecular mass standards (kDa) are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Human DNA Polymerase γ Is a HeterodimerDNA-cellulose chromatography with a 2-fold excess of Hp55 did not increase the yield of the Hp140·Hp55 complex, and recovery of approximately 50% of the Hp55 at 0.25 m salt strongly suggested a 1:1 stoichiometry between the proteins (data not shown). Gel exclusion chromatography and sedimentation analysis were performed to determine more critically the native molecular weight and stoichiometry of the pol γ complex. As measured by gel exclusion chromatography on a Superose12 fast protein liquid chromatography column, the estimated Stoke's radii for Hp55 and Hp140 were 31.1 and 44.2 Å, respectively. These values did not deviate substantially from the sizes expected for monomeric forms of the two proteins. For example, assuming Hp55 is a spherical, globular protein, gel exclusion chromatography predicts a native molecular weight of 51,000. The Stoke's radius of Hp140·Hp55 was 49.9 Å. To refine our understanding of the native conformations of the proteins, band sedimentation was performed. Hp55, Hp140, recombinant Hp140·Hp55, and the native HeLa pol γ complex each sedimented as single, symmetrical peaks with sedimentation constants (s 20,w) of 5.5, 6.8, 8.1, and 8.1 S, respectively. These values, together with an assumed typical partial specific volume of 0.725 cm3/g indicate a native molecular weight for the pol γ complex of 192,000 and a frictional ratio of 1.31. A calculated partial specific volume of 0.722 cm3/g based on the predicted amino acid sequences of Hp140 and Hp55 in an equal molar ratio indicates a native molecular weight for the complex of 190,000 with a frictional ratio of 1.32 (19Martin R.G. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 1372-1379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,20Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). These values are in excellent agreement with the molecular weights deduced from the gene sequences of the proteins lacking mitochondrial targeting sequences. We conclude that our reconstituted, recombinant form of human DNA polymerase γ is chromatographically and hydrodynamically indistinguishable from the native, heterodimeric form of HeLa pol γ.The Accessory Subunit Binds the Catalytic Subunit with High Affinity in the Absence of DNAAs analyzed by DNA-cellulose chromatography, gel exclusion chromatography, and sedimentation analysis, Hp140 and Hp55 were quantitatively converted into heterodimeric Hp140·Hp55 complexes by simple stoichiometric mixingin vitro. We sought to determine the strength of this interaction by protein affinity chromatography. Purified proteins were mixed under physiological conditions, and each of the two proteins was immobilized by virtue of specific affinity to Ni-NTA agarose or DPg-Sepharose, a rabbit polyclonal antibody column specific for the catalytic subunit (11Longley M.J. Ropp P.A. Lim S.E. Copeland W.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10529-10539Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The ability of an immobilized protein to retain the other subunit after extensive washing was determined by immunoblot analysis. Purified histidine-tagged Hp55 was mixed with native Hp140, and the complex was separately immobilized with Ni-NTA agarose (Fig. 4 A) or DPg-Sepharose (Fig. 4 B). Exhaustive washing with a solution containing of 0.05m KP04 (pH 7.5), 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.15m NaCl was followed by immunoblot analysis of captured proteins with anti-Hp140 antibodies (Fig. 4 A) or anti-histidine tagged monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 4 B).Lane 2 in both panels A and B of Fig. 4 clearly demonstrates that immobilized His-Hp55 captured Hp140 and immobilized Hp140 captured His-Hp55, respectively. The immobilized component was required in both orientations (lanes 3), indicating the absence of nonspecific binding of the proteins to each resin. Identical results were obtained when the experiment was repeated with wash buffers containing no salt or 0.5 m NaCl (data not shown), indicating that complexes formed under physiological conditions are not disrupted by extremes of ionic strength.FIG. 4Co-precipitation assay of Hp55 and Hp140 in absence of DNA and in high salt. Purified Hp140 and Hp55 were mixed individually and together with either Ni-NTA agarose or DPg-Sepharose to precipitate the proteins. Immunoprecipitates and Ni-NTA agarose precipitates were washed in buffer containing 0.15m NaCl for 120 column volumes before separating the proteins by 4–20% SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis the proteins were transferred to Immobilon and probed with antibody. A, Western blot of Ni-NTA agarose precipitate probed with anti-Hp140 (anti-DPg).

Ropp P.A. Lim S.E. Copeland W.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10529-10539Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Because Hp55 forms a salt-stable complex with Hp140 and enhances binding to DNA, we tested the ability of Hp55 to restore salt-tolerant activity to Hp140. In reactions that utilized activated salmon sperm DNA, addition of excess Hp55 completely abolished the salt sensitivity of isolated Hp140 and enabled the polymerase to act over a broad range of ionic strength, with optimal activity between ∼75 and ∼175 mm NaCl (Fig. 5 A). Hp55 also expanded the window of optimal activity on poly(rA)·oligo(dT), presumably through enhanced binding of the pol γ complex to this substrate. Isolated Hp140 exhibited salt sensitivity on poly(dA)·oligo(dT), and Hp55 raised the salt optimum to ∼100 mm NaCl (data not shown), similar to what we observed previously with the X. laevisaccessory subunit (15Carrodeguas J.A. Kobayashi R. Lim S.E. Copeland W.C. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4039-4046Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The observed stimulatory effects of Hp55 on Hp140 activity were more closely examined in Hp55 titration experiments at the fixed, optimal salt concentrations identified in Fig. 5 A (Fig. 5 B). Hp55 was unable to stimulate Hp140 activity on activated salmon sperm DNA in the absence of added salt, but activity at 150 mm NaCl was stimulated linearly with increasing amounts of Hp55 until a 1:1 stiochiometry was reached (Fig. 5 B). Excess Hp55 continued to stimulate activity but at a reduced level. Together these observations suggest that salt is necessary for enhanced binding of the pol γ complex during replication of natural DNA. Similarly, stimulation of activity on poly(rA)·oligo(dT) at 150 mm NaCl became less pronounced when Hp55 was no longer limiting. Interestingly, substoichiometric addition of Hp55 caused marked stimulation at 50 mm NaCl on this substrate, but further addition of Hp55 inhibited polymerase activity to the point of negating the stimulatory effect. It is possible that excess Hp55 occupies primer termini or otherwise blocks extension by Hp140 on this substrate.FIG. 5Salt-dependent stimulation of the pol γ catalytic subunit by Hp55. DNA polymerase γ activity was measured on activated salmon sperm DNA (squares) or poly(rA)·oligo(dT)12–18(circles) as described under “Experimental Procedures.”A, reactions contained the indicated concentrations of NaCl and 6 ng of Hp140 alone (open symbols) or in combination with a ∼4-fold excess of Hp55 (closed symbols). Reaction times were 15 min. B, reactions contained 6 ng of Hp140, the indicated stoichiometric equivalents of Hp55, and either 0m (open square), 0.05 m (open circle), or 0.15 m (closed symbols) additional NaCl.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase γ has been previously shown to display a high tolerance for salt (21Longley M.J. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24702-24711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Olson M.W. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23136-23142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and we have documented the salt sensitivity of the exonuclease activity of the isolated human catalytic subunit (11Longley M.J. Ropp P.A. Lim S.E. Copeland W.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10529-10539Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the effect of Hp55 on 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activity and observed modest stimulation with an elevated salt optimum, similar to the results for DNA polymerase activity (data not shown).Hp55 Subunit Markedly Enhances the Processivity of Hp140When limited to a single productive binding event, the processivity of the isolated human catalytic subunit was shown to be 50–75 nucleotides (11Longley M.J. Ropp P.A. Lim S.E. Copeland W.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10529-10539Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Because of the salt sensitivity of isolated Hp140 these reactions were necessarily done in the absence of added salt. In collaboration with the Bogenhagen lab, we subsequently showed that a hybrid pol γ complex composed of the human catalytic subunit and theXenopus second subunit had a processivity of around 250 nucleotides at 100 mm NaCl (15Carrodeguas J.A. Kobayashi R. Lim S.E. Copeland W.C. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4039-4046Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Possession of Hp55 has permitted us to determine directly the effects of the human second subunit on the processivity of Hp140 both in the absence of salt and at physiological salt concentrations. Isolated Hp140 could extend primers more than 100 nucleotides at 0 mm NaCl, and several distinct pause sites were apparent near 75 nucleotides and between 100 and 150 nucleotides (Fig. 6 A,lane 1). Significant excision in the presence of dNTPs (lane 1) indicates a somewhat relaxed specificity for binding to the polymerase active site of the isolated catalytic subunit in the absence of salt. Addition of salt considerably inhibited all activities of isolated Hp140 (lane 2), as expected (11Longley M.J. Ropp P.A. Lim S.E. Copeland W.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10529-10539Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The processivity of Hp140·Hp55 at low salt was approximately 200 nucleotides, and some stalling was still apparent (lane 3). However, addition of 150 mm NaCl eliminated most of the stalling within 100 nucleotides of the primer (lane 4), and the bulk of the primer was converted to a form that could not enter the polyacrylamide gel. In addition, substantial reduction of exonuclease activity under these conditions may indicate a more stringent selection for the polymerase active site of Hp140 in the presence of Hp55. Almost identical results were obtained for the native HeLa pol γ complex (lanes 5 and 6). To resolve fully the high molecular weight products we separated the same reactions on a denaturing agarose gel (Fig. 6 B). Products synthesized by isolated Hp140 at both salt concentrations were too short to be visualized (lanes 1 and 2), but the Hp140·Hp55 complex synthesized products as long as 7 kilobases or the entire length of the M13 substrate (lanes 3 and 4). 3–5-fold more product was apparent for the 150 mm NaCl reaction, consistent with the salt-dependent stimulation of Hp140·Hp55 activities (compare lanes 3 and4).FIG. 6Influence of Hp55 accessory protein on the processivity of DNA polymerase γ on singly primed M13 DNA. Processivity reactions (“Experimental Procedures”) utilized 12 ng of Hp140 (lanes 1–4), 8 ng of Hp55 (lanes 3 and 4), or ∼28 ng of HeLa pol γ complex (lanes 5 and 6). Reactions in lanes 2, 4, and 6 were supplemented with 0.15m NaCl. Lane 0 contained no enzyme.A, samples were analyzed by denaturing 7% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

https://openalex.org/W2049452540,"We have developed two systems for performing Cre-mediated recombination of target genes in the rapidly self-renewing mouse small intestinal and colonic epithelium. When expression of Cre recombinase is placed directly under the control of transcriptional regulatory elements from a fatty acid-binding protein gene (Fabp), deletion of loxP flanked (floxed) DNA sequences is initiated as early as embryonic day 13.5, well before completion of intestinal morphogenesis. By embryonic day 16.5, Fabp-Cre also directs recombination in all cell layers of the transitional epithelium that lines the renal calyces and pelvis, ureters, and bladder. Fabp-Cre expression and recombination are maintained in both epithelia throughout adulthood. The second system allows recombination to be induced only in the gut and at any period during adulthood. This system uses Fabp regulatory elements to direct expression of a reverse tetracycline-regulated transactivator (rtTA). Another transgene encodes Cre under the control oftet operator sequences and a minimal promoter from human cytomegalovirus (tetO-PhCMV-Cre). In the absence of a doxycycline inducer, no basal recombination is detectable in the gut of adult tri-transgenic mice containingFabp-rtTA, tetO-PhCMV-Cre, plus a floxed reporter gene. After 4 days of oral administration of doxycycline, recombination of the reporter is apparent in the small intestinal, cecal, and colonic epithelium. After doxycycline is withdrawn, the recombined locus persists for at least 60 days, indicating that recombination has occurred in epithelial cell progenitors that have long residency times in the proliferative units of the intestine (crypts of Lieberkühn). This inducible system should have a number of applications for examining gene function at selected times in postnatal life, under selected physiologic or pathophysiologic conditions.

It provides an attractive model system for examining how proliferation, differentiation, and death programs are coordinated to maintain several cell lineages. One way of auditing the contribution of specific genes to these programs is by generating null alleles using Cre recombinase expressed under the control of lineage-specific transcriptional regulatory elements. This site-specific integrase from bacteriophage P1 catalyzes recombination at 34-bp1 loxP sites that flank a gene segment to be deleted (7Abremski K. Hoess R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1509-1514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A large toolbox of transcriptional regulatory elements has been assembled that function in the intestine, so it is now possible to express foreign gene products, such as Cre, in specified regions of the cephalocaudal axis of the gut, in selected cell lineages at various points in their differentiation programs, and at various stages of development (e.g. Refs.8Crossman M.W.

Even with these reagents in hand, the rapid and perpetual renewal of this epithelium could pose a problem for those who wish to perform efficient and persistent conditional gene knockouts. Epithelial cell renewal in the adult mouse intestine is fueled by multipotent stem cells located at, or near, the base of flask-shaped mucosal invaginations known as crypts of Lieberkühn (5Cheng H. Leblond C.P. Am. J. Anat. 1974; 141: 537-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar, 13Bjerknes M. Cheng H. Am. J. Anat. 1981; 160: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 14Bjerknes M. Cheng H. Am. J. Anat. 1981; 160: 77-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Crypts are dynamic structures. Their average lifespan is ∼110 days (15Bjerknes M. Biophys. J. 1986; 49: 1223-1227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 16Li Y.Q. Roberts S.A. Paulus U. Loeffler M. Potten C.S. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3271-3279PubMed Google Scholar). Maintenance of crypts is dependent upon their stem cell population. Once this population reaches a critical threshold and the volume of a crypt exceeds a critical size, the crypt divides (17Bjerknes M. J. Theor. Biol. 1994; 168: 349-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Division occurs by branching morphogenesis with asymmetric partitioning of epithelial progenitors among the two daughter crypts (15Bjerknes M. Biophys. J. 1986; 49: 1223-1227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 17Bjerknes M. J. Theor. Biol. 1994; 168: 349-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 18Bjerknes M. Cheng H. Gastroenterology. 1999; 116: 7-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The crypt stem cell has yet to be identified; one candidate is the crypt base columnar cell described by Cheng and Leblond (5Cheng H. Leblond C.P. Am. J. Anat. 1974; 141: 537-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar) during lineage tracing studies that employed tritiated thymidine labeling followed by EM autoradiography. The committed daughters of the stem cells undergo several rounds of division, forming a rapidly cycling transit cell population located in the mid-portion of each adult crypt. The stem cell ultimately gives rise to four cell types in the small intestine: enterocytes, representing >80% of all epithelial cells, goblet cells, enteroendocrine cells, and Paneth cells. The first three lineages complete their terminal differentiation during a rapid (2–5-day) and orderly migration from the crypt up an adjacent villus (1Cheng H. Am. J. Anat. 1974; 141: 481-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 3Cheng H. Leblond C.P. Am. J. Anat. 1974; 141: 461-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 4Cheng H. Leblond C.P. Am. J.

As mature epithelial cells approach the villus tip, they are removed by apoptosis or exfoliation. The Paneth cell lineage is the exception; it differentiates during a downward migration to the crypt base (2Cheng H. Am. J. Anat. 1974; 141: 521-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 13Bjerknes M. Cheng H. Am. J. Anat. 1981; 160: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Paneth cells have a lifespan of ∼20 days (2Cheng H. Am. J. Anat. 1974; 141: 521-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and are absent from colonic crypts. The colon also lacks villi; differentiated epithelial cells emerge from a colonic crypt and form a flat hexagonal-shaped surface epithelial cuff that surrounds the crypt orifice (19Schmidt G.H. Wilkinson M.M. Ponder B.A. Cell. 1985; 40: 425-429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The magnitude of epithelial cell renewal in the intestine is remarkable. On average, each small intestinal crypt produces ∼300 new cells per day, a number equivalent to its steady state population. The ∼7000 epithelial cells that cover a villus located in the mid-portion of the intestine are replaced every ∼30–40 h (e.g. Ref.6Wright N.A. Irwin M. Cell Tissue Kinet. 1982; 15: 595-609PubMed Google Scholar). These features raise several questions for those contemplating using Cre recombinase to orchestrate gene knockouts in the intestinal epithelium, as opposed to cell populations that are non-renewing and/or are long-lived. If Cre is expressed under the control of transcriptional regulatory elements that only operate indifferentiating intestinal epithelial cells, will the speed of recombination be rapid enough so that the gene of interest will be silenced and its product lost before these cells are removed? How many active stem cells does a given crypt contain? Do they have equivalent mitotic rates? Do they have similar or dissimilar residence times in the crypt? If Cre is not directed to all active or potential crypt stem cells, how likely is it that within its lifespan a crypt will become populated by a mixture of cells, some with and some without the Cre-engineered recombined (null) allele? In this report, we establish the feasibility of performing efficient Cre-mediated gene knockouts in colonic crypts. A system for inducing gene knockouts in the colonic epithelium at any time during postnatal life is described. This latter system has allowed us to explore whether a recombined null allele can persist for more than one cycle of epithelial renewal and, coincidentally, to examine the residence time of epithelial progenitors within crypts. This recombinant DNA consists of the following: (i) nucleotides −596 to +21 of the ratFabpl gene, with four additional tandem repeats of its nucleotides −172 to −133 added at nucleotide −132 (Ref. 11Simon T.C. Cho A. Tso P. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10652-10663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar; abbreviated Fabpl 4× at −132) linked to (ii) a 1.0-kb fragment, containing the Cre recombinase gene with a nuclear localization signal from SV40 large T antigen (Ref. 20Lewandoski M. Meyers E.N. Martin G.R. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1997; 62: 159-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; a gift from Gail Martin, University of California, San Francisco), and (iii) nucleotides +3 to +2150 of the human growth hormone gene (hGH). Six pedigrees of FVB/N Fabpl 4× at −132/Cre mice were established. pFabpl4XlacZhGH is a recombinant pBluescript SK+ plasmid that was generated through a multistep process. It contains an insert consisting ofFabpl 4× at −132 linked to a 34-bp loxP site, which in turn is linked to the Escherichia coliβ-galactosidase gene (lacZ). The lacZ sequence is followed by another loxP site and then nucleotides +3 to +2150 of hGH. The Fabpl 4× at −132/(loxP)lacZ(loxP)-hGH insert in pFabpl4XlacZhGH was removed as a 6.8-kb NotI/SalI fragment and injected into FVB/N oocytes. Four pedigrees of mice were established with this transgene. pUHG15-1-rTA (a gift from Michael Rosenberg, Glaxo Wellcome) contains a mutant tetracycline-controlled transactivator (rtTA) (21Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bender G. Muller G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2051) Google Scholar). The rtTA open reading frame (ORF) was excised from pUHG15-1-rTA as a 1.0-kbXbaI/BamHI fragment. (Note that XbaI cleaves just after the initiator ATG codon.) The nucleotide sequence upstream of the ORF was designed according to rules defined by Kozak (22Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar), in an attempt to optimize rtTA mRNA translation. To create this sequence, two oligodeoxynucleotides (5′-GATCCACCATGT-3′ and 5′-CTAGACATGGTG-3′) were annealed to one another, and the resulting double-stranded linker was ligated to (i) the rtTAXbaI/BamHI fragment and (ii) pJS1 (pBluescript SK+-Fabpl 4× at −132/hGH) which had been linearized by BamHI cleavage between itsFabpl 4× at −132 and hGH elements. TheFabpl 4× at −132/rtTA/hGH insert contained in the resulting plasmid, pColon-rtTA, was excised as a 4.0-kbEcoRI fragment and used for injections into FVB/N oocytes. Two pedigrees of FVB/N Fabpl 4× at −132/rtTA mice were characterized. This construct contains 7 copies of the tet operator sequence (7×tetO). 7×tetO is located upstream of a minimal promoter from human cytomegalovirus IEI (PhCMV; Ref. 23Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4268) Google Scholar), which is followed by (i) the Cre recombinase ORF surrounded by 48-bp FRT sites recognized by FLP recombinase (24Senecoff J.F. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7380-7386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and (ii) an intron and polyadenylation sequence from the human β-actin gene. Seven pedigrees of FVB/N transgenic mice were established containing this recombinant DNA. Mice homozygous for ENHmov (25Webber A.L. Ingram R.S. Levorse J.M. Tilghman S.M. Nature. 1998; 391: 711-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) were a gift from Shirley Tilghman (Princeton University). They were produced from ES cells transfected with a targeting vector that allowed a set of two enhancers, normally located 3′ to the H19 gene, to be moved to a position equidistant between H19 and the closely linkedIgf2 gene on chromosome 7. A floxed hygromycin resistance gene ((loxP)hygro R(loxP)) was included next to the displaced enhancers when the ENHmovallele was engineered. All mice used in this study were housed in microisolator cages under a strict light cycle (lights on at 0600 h and off at 1800 h). Mice were given a standard irradiated chow diet (PicoLab Rodent Chow 20, Purina Mills Inc.)ad libitum. Animals were maintained in a specified pathogen-free state. All FVB/N pedigrees were hemizygous for their transgenes. Members of each pedigree were identified by PCR. hGH DNA sequences were detected using 5′-AGGTGGCCTTTGACACCTACCAGG-3′ and 5′-TCTGTTGTGTTTCCTCCCTGTTGG-3′ as primers. This primer pair, which spans intron 2 of the hGH gene, produces a 360-bp product. Cre DNA sequences were identified with 5′-CCGGTTATTCAACTTGCACC-3′ and 5′-CTGCATTACCGGTCGATGCAAC-3′ which generate a 149-bp PCR product. rtTA DNA sequences were detected with 5′-CGCCCAGAAGCTAGGTGTAG-3′ and 5′-GCTCCATCGCGATGACTTAG-3′ which produce a 200-bp product. Cycle conditions were as follows: denaturation, 94 °C for 1 min; annealing, 55 °C for 1 min; extension, 72 °C for 1.5 min, for a total of 30 cycles. cRNA probes for detecting mRNA transcripts containing Cre or rtTA sequences were prepared as follows. A 400-bp BamHI/ClaI fragment from the Cre recombinase gene was subcloned intoBamHI/ClaI-digested pBluescript SK+. A 232-bpStyI/SalI fragment from rtTA was subcloned intoSalI/XbaI-digested pBluescript SK+. In vitro transcriptions were performed with XhoI-digested plasmid DNA as the template, T7 RNA polymerase, and [32P]CTP (NEN Life Science Products), together with reagents and protocols supplied in the MAXIscript kit (Ambion, Inc). Labeled cRNA was hybridized overnight at 50 °C to 15 μg of a total cellular tissue RNA preparation. The products were then added to reaction mixtures containing Tris-HCl (pH 7.5, final concentration 10 mm), NaCl (300 mm), EDTA (5 mm), RNase A (40 μg/ml; 100 units/mg; Sigma) and RNase T1 (2 μg/ml; 10,000 units/mg; Sigma). Following a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, RNA was extracted, precipitated with ethanol, and subjected to electrophoresis through urea/acrylamide gels. A positive control was included in all RNase protection assays. A 270-bp XhoII/DraI fragment of the mouserpl32 gene was subcloned into pBluescript SK+. The resulting recombinant plasmid was linearized with BamHI, andrpl32 cRNA was synthesized using T3 RNA polymerase. The proximal and distal small intestine, cecum, and colon were opened along their cephalocaudal axes, and their luminal contents were removed by washing the tissues in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Each segment was placed in Hanks' buffered saline solution (HBSS) containing 25 mm HEPES and 1% calf serum (Sigma) (3 washes of 5 min each, 20 ml/wash). The washed segments were put in sterile polypropylene tubes containing 20 ml of HBBS/50 mm EDTA, and the tubes were rotated at 100 rpm for 15 min. Tissue fragments were allowed to settle, and the supernatant was removed and saved on ice. The settled tissue fragments were subjected to two more cycles of agitation in HBBS/EDTA, followed by settlement. Supernatants were pooled and spun at 250 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. RNA was isolated (RNeasy kit, Qiagen) from the cell pellets (epithelial fraction) and the remaining tissue fragments (mesenchymal fraction) (26Weiser M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2536-2541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Some fragments from each mesenchymal preparation were fixed in periodate/lysine/paraformaldehyde (PLP) embedded in paraffin, and 5 μm-thick sections were cut. These sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and examined to verify that all the epithelium had been removed. A forward primer (HyF, 5′-GAGTAGAGGCTTGATCAGGGC-3′) and two reverse primers (HyR1, 5′-CCTCACAGCACTACCCTGAGAG-3′ and HyR2, 5′-CTTCCATTGCTCAGCGGTG-3′) were used to assay for recombination at the floxed hygro R locus. HyF and HyR2 amplify a 680-bp fragment from the intact (unrecombined) locus. HyF and HyR1 amplify a 475-bp fragment from the recombined locus. PCR reactions contained 100–250 ng of DNA. Three primers were used to detect recombination of theFabpl 4× at −132/(loxP)lacZ(loxP)-hGH transgene:Fabpl forward primer (fLF; 5′-CTAGAGATGTGATTCACATG-3′); lacZ reverse primer (lacZR, 5′-CTTCGCTATTACGCCAGCTG-3′); and hGH reverse primer (hGHR, 5′-CAAACTCCTGGTAGGTGTCAAAG-3′). fLF and lacZR amplify a 375-bp fragment from the intact transgene, and fLF and hGHR amplify a 302-bp fragment when lacZ has been removed by Cre-mediated recombination. The same thermocycling conditions were employed for all PCR assays of recombination (denaturation, 94 °C for 1 min; annealing, 55 °C for 1 min; extension, 72 °C for 1.5 min, for a total of 30 cycles). E. coliβ-galactosidase was detected by 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactoside (X-Gal) staining. The small intestine, cecum, colon, and bladder were flushed with PBS, cut open along their cephalocaudal axes, and pinned on wax slabs. These wholemount preparations were fixed for 45 min at room temperature in PLP, washed three times in PBS, and incubated in a solution containing dithiothreitol (20 mm), Tris (150 mm, pH 8.0), and ethanol (20%) for 45 min at room temperature. Following three more washes in PBS (5 min/wash), the wholemounts were incubated in X-Gal solution overnight at 4 °C (X-Gal (2 mm; Roche Molecular Biochemicals), potassium ferricyanide (4 mm), potassium ferrocyanide (4 mm), and MgCl2 (2 mm); prepared in PBS, final pH of 7.6). Tissue sections were also stained with X-Gal. 5–8 μm-thick sections, cut from frozen blocks of PLP-fixed tissues, were thawed at room temperature for 20 min, washed in PBS, incubated overnight at 30 °C in X-Gal solution, and then counter-stained with nuclear fast red (Sigma). To detect hGH synthesized after recombination, using light microscopy, the ileum, cecum, colon, and bladder were fixed in PLP for 45 min, embedded in paraffin, and 5 μm-thick sections were prepared. These sections were de-paraffinized with xylene, rehydrated, and pretreated for 15 min at room temperature with PBS-blocking buffer (bovine serum albumin (1%), Triton X-100 (0.3%), and CaCl2 (1 mm) in PBS). Sections were incubated subsequently with rabbit anti-hGH (Dako; diluted 1:200 in PBS-blocking buffer for intestinal sections; 1:5000 for bladder sections). Antigen-antibody complexes were visualized with indocarbocyanine (Cy3)-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit Ig (Jackson ImmunoResearch; final dilution in PBS-blocking buffer = 1:500). Nuclei were stained with bisbenzimide (50 ng/ml PBS). To detect hGH by EM, mice were anesthetized, and a solution of PBS containing paraformaldehyde (2%) and glutaraldehyde (2%) was infused into their left ventricle. The bladder was post-fixed with the perfusion buffer, dehydrated with graded ethanols, and embedded in Lowicryl (Electron Microscopy Sciences). 500-nm thick sections were cut, placed on glass slides, and counterstained with toluidine blue (Electron Microscopy Sciences) for light microscopy. Adjacent 50–80 nm-thick sections were placed on slotted Formvar-coated grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences), and the grids were floated for 30 min at room temperature on a solution of Tris-buffered saline/blocking buffer (Tris (20 mm, pH 7.4), NaCl (150 mm), normal mouse serum (10%; Jackson ImmunoResearch), and Tween 20 (0.3%)). The grids were then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with rabbit anti-hGH (Dako; diluted 1:100 in Tris-buffered saline-blocking buffer). Following washes with Tris-buffered saline, 0.3% Tween 20, antigen-antibody complexes were visualized with goat anti-rabbit IgG containing bound 18-nm colloidal gold particles (Jackson ImmunoResearch; final dilution = 1:15). Grids were counterstained with aqueous uranyl acetate and lead and viewed with a JOEL model X100 electron microscope. Tri-transgenic mice were generated by crossing male FVB/N mice containing Fabpl 4× at −132/rtTA and either (loxP)hygro R(loxP) or Fabpl 4× at −132/(loxP)lacZ(loxP)hGH with female mice containing tetO-PhCMV-Cre. Recombination was induced by adding doxycycline (Sigma, final concentration = 2 mg/ml) and sucrose (5% w/v) to their drinking water. A control group of aged-matched (4–12-week-old) tri-transgenic mice received 5% sucrose alone. All mice were treated for 4 days with drug or vehicle alone. Animals were then sacrificed or they were maintained for an additional 10, 20, 30, or 60 days on water that did not contain any supplements. Recombination was surveyed in tissues using the PCR and immunohistochemical assays described above. We wanted to target gene knockouts to the distal small intestinal and colonic epithelium since these regions of the gut are the sites of a number of human diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease and cancer. Therefore, we chose to express Cre recombinase under the control of transcriptional regulatory elements derived from a fatty acid-binding protein gene. These elements consist of nucleotides −596 to +21 of rat Fabpl with 4 additional copies of a 35-bp sequence, spanning nucleotides −177 to −133, that had been inserted at nucleotide −132 (abbreviated Fabpl 4× at −132) (11Simon T.C. Cho A. Tso P. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10652-10663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Earlier light and EM immunohistochemical studies of several pedigrees of FVB/N transgenic mice had demonstrated thatFabpl 4× at −132 can direct expression of a human growth hormone (hGH) reporter throughout the epithelium of crypts in the distal small intestine (ileum), cecum, and colon of adult mice (11Simon T.C. Cho A. Tso P. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10652-10663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). DNA encoding Cre recombinase with a nuclear localization signal was placed between Fabpl 4× at −132 and nucleotides +3 to +2150 of the hGH gene (encompassing all of its exons and introns). Two in-frame stop codons were positioned between the end of the Cre ORF and the initiator Met codon of hGH to prevent synthesis of hGH from the mRNA product of Fabpl 4× at −132/Cre. RNase protection assays of intestinal RNAs prepared from 6–8-week-old members of six Fabpl 4× at −132/Cre transgenic pedigrees revealed that 4 lines expressed Cre mRNA. Two pedigrees were selected for further study. Six- to 10-week-old mice from both pedigrees had indistinguishable patterns of transgene expression. Steady state levels of Cre mRNA increased from the proximal to distal thirds of their small intestine and were sustained in their cecum and colon (n = 3 mice surveyed/pedigree; see Fig. 1). Expression was also prominent in bladder and ureter but was not detectable in the renal parenchyma or in 11 other tissues (stomach, pancreas, liver, spleen, ovary or testes, muscle, heart, lung, thymus, and brain) (Fig. 1 and data not shown). This tissue-specific pattern of expression was maintained in 10-month-old animals (n = 2/pedigree). FVB/N Fabpl 4× at −132/Cre transgenic mice were crossed to mice with a mixed C57Bl/6-129/Sv genetic background containing a floxed hygromycin resistance gene ((loxP)hygro R(loxP)). Recombination was monitored in bi-transgenic animals using a simple PCR assay (Fig. 2 A). At 6–10 weeks of age, recombination was evident in total cellular DNA isolated from jejunum, ileum, cecum, colon, ureter, and bladder and was undetectable in DNA prepared from the other tissues listed above (Fig. 2 B and data not shown) (n = 6 mice). The same tissue-specific pattern of recombination was documented in 10-month-old bi-transgenic mice. Control PCR assays of DNAs prepared from animals that contained (loxP)hygro R(loxP) without Fabpl 4× at −132/Cre failed to disclose recombination in any tissue, including the gut (data not shown). PCR surveys of DNAs isolated from embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5), E14.5, E15.5, E16.5, and postnatal day 1 (P1), P7, and P14 bi-transgenic mice (n = 2–3/time point) revealed that recombination in the intestine commences as early as E13.5 (data not shown). Recombination in the bladder occurred as by E16.5 (the earliest time point surveyed). To examine the cellular basis of recombination in the adult intestine (and bladder), we generated transgenic mice containing the DNA construct shown in Fig. 3 A. Fabpl 4× at −132 was placed upstream of an ORF encoding E. coli lacZ with an added nuclear localization signal. ThelacZ gene was surrounded by loxP sites. Nucleotides +3 to +2150 of the human growth hormone gene (hGH) were positioned downstream of the lacZ ORF. The lacZ and hGH ORFs were separated by three in-frame stop codons. There were several reasons why we chose to use this transgene as a reporter of Cre-mediated recombination. First, at the time of our study, there were no Cre reporters that had been shown to function in the adult intestine and bladder. Second, this reporter has the advantage of identifying recombination in crypts by two criteria, loss of one foreign gene product (E. coli β-galactosidase) and gain of another (hGH). Finally, expression of these two products is controlled by the same Fabpl 4× at −132 elements as those used to express Cre. We reasoned that if Fabpl 4× at −132/Cre transcription is initiated at a similar cell stratum as Fabpl 4× at −132/(loxP)lacZ(loxP)-hGH), then the relative distributions of lacZ and hGH along the crypt will provide some measure of the speed of Cre-mediated recombination. (By pulse labeling dividing cells located in cecal and proximal colonic crypts with 5′-bromo-2-deoxyuridine, and then following their upward migration by immunohistochemical analysis of sections prepared 1 h and 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 days later, we had determined that it takes an average of only 5 days for cells to migrate to the surface epithelial cuff and to be shed into the lumen (data not shown). Four pedigrees of Fabpl 4× at −132/(loxP)lacZ(loxP)-hGH transgenic mice were generated. RNase protection assays of multiple tissue RNA samples prepared from 6- to 8-week-old adult animals indicated that the transgene was only expressed in one pedigree. Although lacZ-hGH mRNA was present in the intestine of these mice, it was limited to the cecum a"

Only recently have the different phosphoinositide isomers been unambiguously identified in plant cells.

Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6187) Google Scholar). One of the key early events triggered by these physiological stimuli is the activation of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC),1resulting in the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) to the two second messengers, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) and diacylglycerol, which induce Ca2+ release from internal stores and stimulate protein kinase C, respectively (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6187) Google Scholar, 2Berridge M.J. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1989; 341: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (3313) Google Scholar). During the last decade, it has become evident that in addition to serving as precursors to Ins(1,4,5)P3 and diacylglycerol, phosphoinositides actively participate in other cellular functions: they have been shown to regulate the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton through the interaction with actin-binding proteins (3Lassing I. Lindberg U. Nature. 1985; 314: 472-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 4Janmey P.A. Stossel T.P. Nature. 1987; 325: 362-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), and to potentiate the activation of protein kinase C (5Oh E.S. Woods A. Lim S.T. Theibert A.W. Couchman J.R. J. Biol.

In addition, phosphoinositides phosphorylated at the D3-hydroxy group of the inositol headgroup are required for specific vesicle trafficking steps (8De Camilli P. Emr S.D. McPherson P.S. Novick P. Science. 1996; 271: 1533-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 9Wurmser A.E. Gary J.D. Emr S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9129-9132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) and are able to activate the recently identified novel protein kinases Akt/PKB and phosphoinositide-dependent kinases (10Wymann M.P. Pirola L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 127-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Recently, a new 3-phosphorylated phosphoinositide, phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2), was identified and shown to accumulate in yeast cells subjected to hyperosmotic or NaCl stress (11Dove S.K. Cooke F.T. Douglas M. Sayers L. Parker P.J. Michell R.H. Nature. 1997; 390: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Contrasting with the very detailed picture available for the components of the phosphoinositide system, and their function and regulation in animal cells, it is still not clear for plant cells whether any physiological factors act by stimulating PI-PLC-catalyzed PtdIns(4,5)P2 hydrolysis. However, it has been demonstrated that micro-injected “caged” Ins(1,4,5)P3 can release Ca2+ from internal stores (12Alexandre J. Lassalles J.F. Kado R.D. Nature. 1990; 343: 567-570Crossref Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and is also able to trigger stomatal closure (13Blatt M.F. Thiel G. Trentham D.R. Nature. 1990; 346: 766-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 14Gilroy S. Read N.D. Trewavas A.J. Nature. 1990; 346: 769-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). There is also evidence that phosphoinositides may participate in the regulation of cytoskeletal structures in plant cells (15Yang W. Burkhart W. Cavallius J. Merrick W.C. Boss W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 392-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Drøbak B.K. Watkins P.A.C. Valenta R. Dove S.K. Lloyd C.W. Staiger C.J. Plant J. 1994; 6: 389-400Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar). A number of reports also suggest that a wide range of signals, such as light, hormones, and stress, may mediate their effect through phosphoinositide metabolism (17Drøbak B.K. Biochem J. 1992; 288: 697-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), although the effects reported were often very limited and the identity of the lipid or inositol phosphate species affected not always clearly demonstrated. Interestingly, hyperosmotic stress was recently shown to induce an increase in PtdIns(3,5)P2 synthesis inChlamydomonas moewusii and in some higher plant cells (18Meijer H.J.G. Divecha N. van den Ende H. Musgrave A. Munnik T. Planta. 1999; 208: 294-298Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar). With the exception of phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate (PtdIns(5)P) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3), all the phosphoinositide isomers found in animal and yeast cells have also been identified in plant cells (11Dove S.K.

Salinity is a common and detrimental environmental stress imposed on land plants (29Epstein E. Norlyn J.D. Rush D.W. Kingsbury R.W. Kelley D.B. Cunningham G.A. Wrona A.F. Science. 1980; 210: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Salt tolerance is mediated by multiple determinants (30Niu X. Bressan R.A. Hasegawa P.M. Pardo J.M. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 735-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar), a notion reflected in the observation that the expression of numerous genes is altered in plants subjected to high salt conditions (31Zhu J.-K. Hasegawa P.M. Bressan R.A. Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 1997; 16: 253-277Crossref Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Knowledge of the mechanisms by which plants perceive and transduce salinity stress should provide crucial information to successfully improve salt tolerance in plants through genetic engineering. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the expression of one PtdInsP kinase gene (23Mikami J. Katagiri T. Iuchi S. Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Shinozaki K. Plant J. 1998; 15: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and one PI-PLC gene (25Hirayama T. Ohto C. Mizoguchi T. Shinozaki K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3903-3907Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) is increased by salt stress, suggesting that phosphoinositides may participate in the response to high salinity. There is also evidence that cytosolic Ca2+ is a likely component of the transduction cascade (32Lynch J. Polito V.S. Lauchli A. Plant Physiol. 1989; 90: 1271-1274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Liu J. Zhu J.-K. Science. 1998; 280: 1943-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 34Knight H. Trewavas A.J. Knight M.R.

Here we present results clearly showing that increased synthesis of PtdIns(4,5)P2 and diacylglycerol pyrophosphate (DGPP) and also increased turnover of phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho), may be involved in the response to high salinity in plant cells. A. thaliana(ecotype Fi-3) cells were grown in suspension in Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium as described (35Liu B. Joshi H.C. Wilson T.J. Silflow C.D. Palevitz B.A. Snustad D.P. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), except that the phosphate concentration was 50 mg/liter, and subcultured every week. For phospholipid labeling, the cells were used 2 days after the last subculture. [32P]Orthophosphate (32Pi),myo-[2-3H]inositol, and [methyl-14C]choline chloride were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All cell culture chemicals were of cell culture grade and purchased from Sigma. Standard lipids were from Sigma. Monomethylamine (40% aqueous solution) was from Fluka. Standard [3H]glycerophosphoinositol phosphates ([3H]GroPInsP n s) were purified from [3H]inositol-radiolabeled yeast cells as described in Ref. 11Dove S.K. Cooke F.T. Douglas M. Sayers L. Parker P.J. Michell R.H. Nature. 1997; 390: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar. Cells were collected 2 days after sub-culture, filtered through a metal mesh and washed with phosphate-free MS medium. They were resuspended to an A 600 ≈ 1.0 and incubated at 26 °C and 130 rpm for at least 15 min before addition of 32Pi (0.1–0.2 mCi/ml). The cells were further incubated in the same conditions for 90 min, or the specified time when indicated otherwise, and then treated with NaCl or sorbitol for 15 min or as otherwise indicated. The treatment was terminated by addition of two volumes of ice-cold methanol, vortexing, and freezing in liquid nitrogen. Cells were grown in inositol-free MS medium supplemented withmyo-[2-3H]inositol for 5 days, and subcultured for another 2 days in the same growth medium. Cells were then collected and resuspended to an A 600 ≈ 1.0 and processed further as indicated above for 32Pilabeling. Cells were radiolabeled with [methyl-14C]choline exactly as described for 32Pi, except that the culture medium was full MS. The extraction procedure used followed that described for yeast cells (36Dove S.K. Michell R.H. Milligan G. Signal Transduction: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999: 255-281Google Scholar). After extraction, the washed lower chloroform-rich phases were dried under nitrogen. The lipid extracts were then analyzed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) or HPLC as described below. Dried [32P]-radiolabeled lipids extracted from A. thaliana cells were dissolved in chloroform and spotted on silica gel 60 TLC plates (Merck) pre-treated with K+-oxalate/EDTA/methanol (1% (w/v)/1 mm/50% (v/v)). The TLC was developed either with an alkaline, CHCl3/CH3OH/15 mNH4OH/H2O (90/70/4/16; v/v/v/v), or an acidic, CHCl3/CH3OCH3/CH3OH/HAc/H2O (40/15/14/13/7.5; v/v/v/v/v) solvent system. Radiolabeled lipids were visualized and quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Dried lipids or individual TLC spots visualized by phosphorimaging were resuspended in deacylation mixture (monomethylamine/CH3OH/H2O/butanol; 5/4/3/1; v/v/v/v) and incubated at 53 °C for 40 min. The deacylated lipids were cooled on ice for 15 min before drying in a vacuum evaporator. The dried samples were resuspended in 1 ml of butanol/petroleum ether/ethyl formate (20/4/1; v/v/v) plus 0.95 ml of H2O and 50 μl of 0.5 m Hepes/KOH, pH 7.5. After centrifugation at 100 × g for 3 min, the lower phases containing the GroPInsP n s were transferred to Eppendorf tubes while the upper phases were washed once with 1 ml of H2O. After centrifugation, the new lower phases were combined to the corresponding first lower phases. The combined lower phases were dried in vacuo. The dried samples were dissolved in H2O and stored at −20 °C until analyzed. Samples were applied on a Partisphere 46 mm x 250-mm 5-μm SAX HPLC column (Whatman) and eluted with the following gradient: H2O for 5 min, up to 150 mm(NH4)H2PO4 (pH 3.8) in 60 min, 150 mm (NH4)H2PO4 for 20 min, up to 1 m(NH4)H2PO4 in 25 min, 1m (NH4)H2PO4 for 10 min, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions of 1 ml were collected and counted in a Beckman LC6000IC scintillator counter. The lipid giving rise to the deacylation product present in fraction 76 in Fig. 2 Awas believed to be DGPP (the deacylation product would therefore be glyceropyrophosphate). Fraction 76 was hydrolyzed with 4 mformic acid for 10 min at 100 °C, and then aliquots of fraction 76, both before and after mild acid hydrolysis, were spotted on a polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC sheet together with authentic glycerophosphate (GroP), Pi, and32Pi. The TLC was then developed and the unradiolabeled standards stained exactly as described (37Munnik T. de Vrije T. Musgrave A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15708-15715Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The pattern of 32P-radiolabeled phospholipids extracted from suspension-cultured A. thaliana cells and separated by one-dimensional TLC is presented in Fig. 1. In order to identify some of the radiolabeled phospholipids, non-radiolabeled commercial phospholipids were mixed with the purified radiolabeled samples, prior to TLC separation. As shown in Fig. 1, the addition of excess non-radiolabeled lipids affected the migration of the corresponding radiolabeled lipids. In this way, and by comparison to the TLC profiles obtained with other plant species (37Munnik T. de Vrije T. Musgrave A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15708-15715Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), the different radiolabeled phospholipids were tentatively identified as indicated in Fig. 1. The TLC alkaline solvent system used here resolved two phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PtdInsP2) isomers, PtdIns(3,5)P2 and PtdIns(4,5)P2, obtained from32Pi-radiolabeled yeast cells (data not shown), and has previously been shown to separate phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P2) from PtdIns(4,5)P2 (20Munnik T. Irvine R.F. Musgrave A. Biochem J. 1994; 298: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), as well as PtdIns(4,5)P2from PtdIns(3,5)P2 (18Meijer H.J.G. Divecha N. van den Ende H. Musgrave A. Munnik T. Planta. 1999; 208: 294-298Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar) from plants. However, it does not permit a clear separation of the different PtdInsP isomers (see,e.g., Ref. 38Munnik T. Musgrave A. de Vrije T. Planta. 1994; 193: 89-98Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In order to confirm the identity of the different 32P-radiolabeled phospholipids we analyzed their deacylation products by chromatography on a strong anion-exchange HPLC column. Fig. 2 A shows that two glycerophosphoinositol monophosphate isomers, [3H]glycerophosphoinositol 3-phosphate ([3H]GroPIns(3)P) and [3H]glycerophosphoinositol 4-phosphate ([3H]GroPIns(4)P), and two glycerophosphoinositol bisphosphate isomers, [3H]glycerophosphoinositol-3,5-bisphosphate ([3H]GroPIns(3,5)P2) and [3H]glycerophosphoinositol-4,5-bisphosphate ([3H]GroPIns(4,5)P2), purified frommyo-[2-3H]inositol-radiolabeled yeast cells, as described (11Dove S.K. Cooke F.T. Douglas M. Sayers L. Parker P.J. Michell R.H. Nature. 1997; 390: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), were well resolved from each other on the Partisphere SAX column. The profile obtained with the water-soluble fraction after deacylation of phospholipids extracted from32Pi-radiolabeled A. thaliana cells comprised peaks eluting from the column exactly as authentic [3H]GroPIns(3)P, [3H]GroPIns(4)P, and [3H]GroPIns(4,5)P2, respectively (Fig. 2 A). [32P]GroPIns(4)P represented approximately 90% of the total [32P]GroPInsP n s, which closely agrees with the levels reported for Spirodela polyrhiza (39Brearley C.A. Hanke D.E. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 40Brearley C.A. Hanke D.E. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), Commelina communis (19Parmar P.N. Brearley C.A. Plant J. 1993; 4: 255-263Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar), andChlamydomonas eugametes (20Munnik T. Irvine R.F. Musgrave A. Biochem J. 1994; 298: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The identity of the A. thaliana derived, 32P-radiolabeled peaks that did not co-chromatograph with any of the standard [3H]GroPInsP n s was deduced from similar profiles published for other plant systems (39Brearley C.A. Hanke D.E. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 41Brearley C.A. Parmar P.N. Hanke D.E. Biochem.

IRL Press, Oxford1997: 1-31Google Scholar) and from the myo-[2-3H]inositol labeling profile (Fig. 2 C), which showed that two peaks detected with32Pi-labeling did not incorporatemyo-[2-3H]inositol. The32P-radiolabeled bands tentatively identified as PtdIns(4,5)P2, PtdInsP, and DGPP in Fig. 1 were individually scraped from a TLC plate, deacylated, and the resulting water-soluble products chromatographed individually on the Partisphere SAX column (Fig. 2 B). Approximately 95% of the radioactivity present in each of the PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdInsP bands was recovered in the water-soluble phase after deacylation, demonstrating that these lipids did not contain significant amounts of phosphosphingolipids, some of which have been shown to co-chromatograph with PtdInsP2s on TLC (43Lester R.L. Becker G.W. Kaul K. Wells W. Eisenberg Jr., F. Inositol Metabolism in Plants. Academic Press, New York1978: 83-102Google Scholar, 44Drøbak B.K. Ferguson I.B. Dawson A.P. Irvine R.F. Plant Physiol. 1988; 87: 217-222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The water-soluble product obtained from the deacylation of the putative [32P]PtdIns(4,5)P2 band eluted from the column as a single peak at the same position as yeast [3H]GroPIns(4,5)P2 (Fig. 2 B). The deacylation product obtained from the PtdInsP band contained two radiolabeled compounds, which behaved like yeast [3H]GroPIns(3)P and [3H]GroPIns(4)P, respectively (Fig. 2 B). The [32P]phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate ([32P]PtdIns(4)P)/[32P]phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate ([32P]PtdIns(3)P) ratio calculated from the deacylation product of the PtdInsP TLC band was similar to that deduced from the HPLC profile obtained from total lipid deacylates (Fig. 2 A). Finally, the deacylation product of the putative [32P]DGPP band eluted as a single peak at 76 ml (Fig. 2 B), matching exactly the elution of one of the products present in the total 32P-labeled lipid deacylate (see Fig. 2 A). Mild acid hydrolysis of fraction 76 produced two radioactive compounds, which, on polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plates, chromatographed exactly as authentic GroP and Pi(data not shown). This confirmed that the original lipid putatively identified as DGPP indeed was DGPP. We also examined the incorporation ofmyo-[2-3H]inositol into lipids of A. thaliana cells (Fig. 2 C). This demonstrated that the three 32P-radiolabeled GroPInsP n isomers identified in Fig. 2 A as representing [32P]GroPIns(3)P, [32P]GroPIns(4)P, and [32P]GroPIns(4,5)P2 also incorporatedmyo-[2-3H]inositol, and that the other peaks observed in Fig. 2 A, except for [32P]GroPIns, were absent in the total lipid deacylate frommyo-[2-3H]inositol-radiolabeled cells. The [3H]GroPIns(4)P/[3H]GroPIns(3)P ratio was similar to the one determined for 32P-radiolabeled samples. PtdIns(4,5)P2 was the only PtdInsP2 isomer we could detect in both 32Pi- andmyo-[2-3H]inositol-radiolabeled A. thaliana cells, under the conditions tested. In addition, we were unable to detect any PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, an isomer that has so far never been detected in plant cells, although the amount of radioactivity incorporated into polyphosphoinositides would probably not have allowed us to detect this compound as in animal cells levels of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 never exceed 0.1% of the radioactivity in PtdIns(4)P and PtdIns(4,5)P2 even under stimulated conditions. The incorporation of 32P into most phospholipids was detectable after a few minutes of labeling (Fig. 3). However, the radiolabeling of the quantitatively minor lipids (i.e. the polyphosphoinositides, DGPP, and phosphatidic acid (PtdOH)) reached a maximum much earlier than for the other phospholipids. For PtdInsP, PtdIns(4,5)P2, PtdOH, and DGPP, a maximum was reached between 15 and 30 min, while the levels of [32P]phosphatidylglycerol ([32P]PtdGro), [32P]phosphatidylethanolamine, [32P]PtdIns, and some additional unidentified lipids continued to increase well beyond the time scale of the experiment. This obviously reflects the fact that the quantitatively minor lipids all possess a monoester phosphate group, which approaches isotopic equilibrium with the added32Pi much more rapidly than the diester phosphate group present in the other phospholipids because of the much higher rate of turnover of phosphomonoesters. Since under these conditions (i.e. short term radiolabeling) the monoester phosphates will be at isotopic equilibrium with the32Pi and the diester phosphates of these compounds will scarcely be radiolabeled, any change in radioactivity can be interpreted as a change in mass for the polyphosphoinositides and DGPP, as long as the monoester phosphates of these compounds can be shown to have attained isotopic equilibrium. This is most commonly demonstrated by extracting a fixed mass of cells at different times during a short term radiolabeling regime and extracting the lipids and quantifying the amount of 32P associated with each lipid, as in Fig. 3. When the level of 32P in a given compound reaches a plateau the monoester phosphate of that compound has attained isotopic equilibrium. Fig. 3 shows that the 32P incorporation into the quantitatively minor phospholipids reached equilibrium after 30 min of labeling with 32Pi. However, depending on the experiment, it was sometimes necessary to label the cells for 90 min in order to reach a stable and reproducible background 32P incorporation into the phospholipids, as shown, for example in Fig. 1. Therefore, the cells were routinely radiolabeled with 32Pi for 90 min before lipids were extracted or before application of any treatments. As previously observed with plant cells, the steady-state level of PtdIns(4,5)P2 was much lower than that of PtdInsP (see,e.g., Fig. 1) (17Drøbak B.K. Biochem J. 1992; 288: 697-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 38Munnik T. Musgrave A. de Vrije T. Planta. 1994; 193: 89-98Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). NaCl (0.4 m) induced large increases in the steady-state levels of several32P-radiolabeled phospholipids, namely PtdIns(4,5)P2 and DGPP. The levels of radioactivity also increased in an additional phospholipid, which, on TLC, chromatographed exactly like authentic soybean PtdCho (Fig. 4). To confirm that this lipid indeed was PtdCho, we briefly radiolabeled cells with [methyl-14C]choline. As shown in Fig. 4 D, this lipid incorporated choline, and no other lipid appeared to be radiolabeled under these conditions. The increased incorporation of 32P-radiolabel into PtdCho is suggestive of an increase in turnover of this lipid, but since the diester phosphate of PtdCho is nowhere near isotopic equilibrium, the increase in radioactivity does not allow any conclusions about changes in the steady-state levels of this lipid to be drawn from data gathered under this experimental regime. The accumulation of [32P]PtdIns(4,5)P2 was consistently detectable within minutes of NaCl addition, and the levels rose 8–25-fold after 10–20 min (Figs. 4 B and5). The effect of NaCl on the incorporation of radiolabel into PtdCho was very similar whether cells were radiolabeled briefly with 32Pi or [methyl-14C]choline (Fig. 4, A andD). The steady-state levels of PtdIns(4,5)P2remained high for at least 1 h, and returned to levels close to those of control cells after 2–6 h (Figs. 4 B and 7). In contrast, no decrease in [32P]PtdCho was observed 6 h following salt stress (Fig. 4 B). After a lag phase of a few minutes, during which [32P]DGPP was not affected by the salt treatment, it reached concentrations 10–40 times higher than in control cells after 15 min, and continued to rise slowly for at least 1 h (Fig. 4 B, 6, and 7). Thereafter, DGPP remained elevated between 1 and 2 h of treatment and started to decrease significantly after 6 h (Fig. 4, A and B). Of the other phospholipids, only PtdInsPs were affected by the salinity treatment, whereas PtdIns and PtdOH showed no alterations (Fig. 4,A and C). However, we consistently detected a sharp drop in PtdOH levels, by approximately 50%, during the first few minutes following the addition of NaCl (Fig. 4, A andC). By 15 min, PtdOH concentration had returned to its value before addition of salt. HPLC analyses of [3H]inositol-radiolabeled lipids revealed that of the two PtdInsP isomers, PtdIns(4)P was the one that responded to the salinity stress (Fig. 6). Simultaneously to the large increase in PtdIns(4,5)P2, PtdIns(4)P decreased by almost 50%, while PtdIns(3)P was unaffected. This decrease in the levels of PtdIns4P is exactly what would be predicted to occur if activation of PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase(s) preceded activation of the plant PtdIns 4-kinase(s)."
https://openalex.org/W2035400225,"Vinculin plays a dynamic role in the assembly of the actin cytoskeleton. A strong interaction between its head and tail domains that regulates binding to other cytoskeletal components is disrupted by acidic phospholipids. Here, we present the crystal structure of the vinculin tail, residues 879-1066. Five amphipathic helices form an antiparallel bundle that resembles exchangeable apolipoproteins. A C-terminal arm wraps across the base of the bundle and emerges as a hydrophobic hairpin surrounded by a collar of basic residues, adjacent to the N terminus. We show that the C-terminal arm is required for binding to acidic phospholipids but not to actin, and that binding either ligand induces conformational changes that may represent the first step in activation."

Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2215) Google Scholar and references therein). The 20 S proteasome is a barrel-like particle with a molecular mass of ∼750 kDa, appearing as a stack of four rings made up of two outer α rings and two inner β rings. Tertiary structural analysis indicates that the center of the α ring is almost closed, thus preventing penetration of substrates into the interior of the β ring on which the proteolytically active sites are located (2Groll M. Ditzel L. Lowe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1923) Google Scholar). Presumably because of this structural feature, the 20 S proteasome exists as a latent form in cells. The latent proteasome is activated fully by a recently identified endogenous protein, the proteasome activator PA28 (also known as the 11 S regulator) (3Ma C.P. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 22369-22377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PA28 differs from another well known proteasome regulator designated PA700. The latter is made up of multiple subunits of 25–110 kDa and associates with the 20 S proteasome to form the 26 S proteasome, a eukaryotic ATP-dependent protease complex with a molecular mass of ∼2 MDa (reviewed in Refs. 5Baumeister W.

Commun. 1998; 247: 537-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The 26 S proteasome is responsible for the degradation of a wide variety of cellular proteins tagged with a polyubiquitin chain that functions as a degradation signal. Extensive studies conducted during the past decade have established that the 26 S proteasome plays a critical role in various biological processes by regulating the levels of cellular proteins rapidly, timely, and/or irreversibly (9Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6736) Google Scholar, 10Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7151-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar). The native PA28 is a protein complex with a molecular mass of ∼200 kDa that binds directly to both ends of the 20 S proteasome to form a football-like structure (5Baumeister W. Walz J. Zühl F. Seemüller E. Cell. 1998; 92: 367-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar, 11Gray C.W. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Binding of PA28 greatly stimulates multiple peptidase activities of the 20 S proteasome. However, the football-like proteasome lacks the ability to degrade large protein substrates, suggesting that PA28 may cooperate with the 26 S proteasome in a sequential proteolytic pathway (2Groll M. Ditzel L. Lowe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1923) Google Scholar, 3Ma C.P. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10515-10523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, our recent work indicates the existence of a “hybrid-type” proteasome (12Hendil K.B. Khan S. Tanaka K. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 749-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), with PA28 attached to one end and PA700 to another end of the 20 S proteasome. Similar to the 26 S proteasome, this type of proteasome appears to function as an ATP-dependent protease. 1N. Tanahashi, Y. Murakami, Y. Minami, N. Shimbara, B. H. Hendil, and K. Tanaka, manuscript in preparation. 1N. Tanahashi, Y. Murakami, Y. Minami, N. Shimbara, B. H. Hendil, and K. Tanaka, manuscript in preparation. PA28 is composed of two subunits, named PA28α and PA28β, that share ∼50% amino acid identity (13Ahn J.Y. Tanahashi N. Akiyama K. Hisamatsu H. Noda C. Tanaka K. Chung C.H. Shibmara N. Willy P.J. Mott J.D. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. FEBS Lett. 1995; 366: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). These subunits assemble into a heterohexamer (α3β3) with alternating α and β subunits (14Song X. Mott J.D. von Kampen J. Pramanik B. Tanaka K. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26410-26417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) or a heteroheptamer (α3β4 or a mixture of α3β4 and α4β3) (15Zhang Z. Krutchinsky A. Endicott S. Realini C. Rechsteiner M. Standing K.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5651-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Cloning of PA28α and PA28β cDNAs revealed that the α and β subunits are structurally similar to a nuclear protein, termed Ki antigen, which was initially identified with autoantibodies found in sera of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (13Ahn J.Y. Tanahashi N. Akiyama K. Hisamatsu H. Noda C. Tanaka K. Chung C.H. Shibmara N. Willy P.J. Mott J.D. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. FEBS Lett. 1995; 366: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Ki antigen associates reversibly with the 20 S proteasome, indicating that it is a genuine component of the PA28 protein family (16Tanahashi N. Yokota K. Ahn J.Y. Chung C.H. Fujiwara T. Takahashi E. DeMartino G.N. Slaughter C.A. Toyonaga T. Yamamura K. Shimbara N. Tanaka K. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 195-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Therefore, Ki antigen was renamed PA28γ (16Tanahashi N. Yokota K. Ahn J.Y. Chung C.H. Fujiwara T. Takahashi E. DeMartino G.N. Slaughter C.A. Toyonaga T. Yamamura K. Shimbara N. Tanaka K. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 195-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, PA28γ appears to form a homopolymer, presumably PA28(γ)6 or PA28(γ)7 (16Tanahashi N. Yokota K. Ahn J.Y. Chung C.H. Fujiwara T. Takahashi E. DeMartino G.N. Slaughter C.A. Toyonaga T. Yamamura K. Shimbara N. Tanaka K. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 195-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Upon stimulation with IFN-γ,2 the protein levels of both PA28α and PA28β increase markedly in a variety of cells, whereas that of PA28γ remains unchanged or is slightly decreased (reviewed in Refs. 17Tanaka K.

Furthermore, PA28α and PA28β are located primarily in the cytoplasm, whereas PA28γ occurs in the nucleus without appreciable localization in the cytoplasm (19Soza A. Knuehl C. Groettrup M. Henkliein P. Tanaka K. Kloetzel P.-M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 20Wojcik C. Paweletz N. Tanaka K. Wilk S. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 77: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Thus, the two forms of the PA28 complex differ in terms of the responsiveness to IFN-γ and subcellular localization. Proteasomes are the central enzymes responsible for the generation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I ligands (reviewed in Refs. 17Tanaka K. Kasahara M. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 161-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 18Fruh K. Yang Y. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, and 21Rock K.L. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Immnunol. 1999; 17: 739-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Recently, Groettrup et al. (22Groettrup M. Ruppert T. Kuehn L. Seeger M. Standera S. Koszinowski U. Kloetzel P.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23808-23815Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) found that, together with the MHC-encoded LMP subunits of the proteosome, the IFN-γ-inducible form of PA28 enhances the generation of class I binding peptide by altering the cleavage pattern of the proteasome. More recently, this form of PA28 was found to enhance the induction of virus-specific killer T cells in vivo (23Groettrup M. Soza A. Eggers M. Kuehn L. Dick T.P. Schild H. Rammensee H.G.

These findings suggest that the IFN-γ-inducible PA28 plays an important role in the generation of MHC class I ligands (17Tanaka K. Kasahara M. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 161-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In contrast, no information is available concerning the biological or biochemical function of the PA28γ homopolymer. To gain insights into its biological function, we created mice lacking the PA28γ gene (Psme3). PA28γ was not essential in mouse development, but its absence resulted in retardation of cell proliferation and body growth. A 12-kbNotI fragment containing the entire coding region of the PA28γ gene was obtained from a 129/SvJ mouse genomic library (Stratagene) as previously reported (26Kandil E. Kohda K. Ishibashi T. Tanaka K. Kasahara M. Immunogenetics. 1997; 46: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 27Kohda K. Ishibashi T. Shimbara N. Tanaka K. Matsuda Y. Kasahara M. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4923-4935PubMed Google Scholar). The targeting vector consisted of the 6.2-kb genomic DNA containing the 1.2-kb neomycin resistance gene derived from pMC1neopoly(A) (see Fig. 1 A). A 1.1-kb diphtheria toxin gene (DT-A) derived from pMC1DT-3 was attached to the 5′ end of the PA28γ-neomycin construct. The targeting vector was linearized with SalI and transfected by electroporation into TT2 embryonic stem (ES) cells (courtesy of Dr. S. Aizawa, Kumamoto University). ES cells were selected in 200 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Colonies of ES cells with homologous recombination events were identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of a 2.4-kb fragment using the primer pair derived from the 5′-upstream region of the PA28γ gene (5′-CACTGCCTAATTGTTGAAAGAGGAGATGCTGTC-3′) and from the neomycin gene (5′-GTCTTTTTATTGCCGATCCCCTCAGAAGAACTC-3′). To verify the results of PCR screening, genomic DNAs prepared from the PCR-positive ES clones were digested with EcoRI and BamHI, transferred to a nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and then hybridized with the probe specific for the 5′-upstream region of the PA28γ genes (see Fig. 1 A). Expected fragment sizes for wild-type and mutant PA28γ genes were 5.0 and 2.0 kb, respectively (see Fig. 1 B). ES cells heterozygous for the targeted mutation were microinjected into 8 cell-stage ICR mouse embryos and then transplanted into uteri of pseudopregnant BDF1 mice. Chimeric males were crossed to C57BL/6J females. Germline transmission was identified by Southern blot analysis. Progeny containing the mutant PA28γ allele were intercrossed to obtain PA28γ-deficient mice. Southern, Northern, and Western blot analyses confirmed disruption of the gene. Total RNA was isolated from newborn mice using TRIZOL™ (Life Technologies, Inc.). Ten μg of total RNA was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane. Full-length mouse PA28γ cDNA (26Kandil E. Kohda K. Ishibashi T. Tanaka K. Kasahara M. Immunogenetics. 1997; 46: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) was labeled with32P using random primers and used as a probe to detect PA28γ mRNAs. Newborn mice (see Fig. 1 D) or mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) (see Fig. 5 A) were homogenized and solubilized in 1% SDS in TE buffer (10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA). An equal amount of proteins was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 12.5% gel, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore), and probed with an anti-PA28α, -PA28β, or -PA28γ antibody. The antibodies for PA28β and PA28γ were described previously (16Tanahashi N. Yokota K. Ahn J.Y. Chung C.H. Fujiwara T. Takahashi E. DeMartino G.N. Slaughter C.A. Toyonaga T. Yamamura K. Shimbara N. Tanaka K. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 195-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The anti-PA28α antibody raised by immunizing rabbits with full-length recombinant PA28α was a generous gift from Dr. Y. Minami (Oita Medical University). MEFs were obtained from 13.5-day-old embryos. Cells were cultured at 37 °C (5% CO2) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin, l-glutamate, sodium pyruvate, and nonessential amino acids. For G1 synchronization by serum starvation, asynchronous cultures at confluence were placed in DMEM containing 0.1% FBS for 72 h. 4 × 105 cells of each line were plated in DMEM with 10% FBS in a series of 6-cm culture dishes. Cells were counted daily with a hemocytometer. For cell size measurement, MEFs were trypsinized, washed with ice-cold PBS, and their forward scatter was measured by FACScan (Becton Dickinson) as soon as possible. For cell cycle analysis, MEFs at logarithmic growth were pulse-labeled with 10 μm BrdUrd (Sigma) for 30 min, trypsinized, and fixed in 70% ethanol. For continuous labeling, G1 synchronized cells were trypsinized, replated at a density of 1.5 × 106 cells per 10-cm dish in DMEM with 10% FBS containing 65 μm BrdUrd, trypsinized after 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 h, and fixed in 70% ethanol. Fixed cells were kept at −20 °C until analysis. Cells were treated with 2 N HCl to denature the DNA, followed by neutralization by sodium borate. Cells were then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-BrdUrd antibodies (PharMingen) and counterstained with propidium iodide containing RNase (20 μg/ml). The stained cells were analyzed by FACScan. Cell debris and fixation artifacts were gated out, and G1, S, and G2/M populations were quantitated using CellQuest software. In each experiment, a similar number of events was analyzed. PA28γ+/+ and PA28γ−/− MEFs were cultured on a slide glass, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS, quenched with 50 mmNH4Cl, permealized with 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS for 30 min at room temperature, and blocked with Blockace™ (Yukijirushi) overnight at 4 °C. Cells were then incubated with a primary antibody solution containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h, washed in Triton X-100/PBS, and incubated with a secondary FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody. As a control, nonimmune rabbit sera were used. Cells were embedded in SlowFade (Molecular Probes) mounting medium. The targeting construct was designed to delete the genomic fragment extending from exon 2 to exon 8 of the PA28γ gene (Fig. 1 A). PCR screening of 600 colonies resistant to G418 revealed that three ES cell clones underwent homologous recombination. Southern blot analysis with the probe external to the targeting construct confirmed the expected recombination events. Microinjection of PA28γ+/− ES cells into 8 cell-stage ICR embryos produced multiple chimeric males, and germline transmission was demonstrated for chimeras derived from one ES clone. Intercross of the PA28γ+/− mice produced offspring at predicted Mendelian ratios (Table I), suggesting that the PA28γ deficiency did not result in mortality during embryogenesis or fetal development. Southern blot analysis of DNAs extracted from the PA28γ+/− and PA28γ−/− mice confirmed the disruption of the PA28γ gene (Fig. 1 B). Inactivation of the PA28γ gene was also confirmed by Northern and Western blot analyses (Fig. 1, C and D). The expression levels in PA28γ+/− heterozygotes were nearly one-half of those in PA28γ+/+ homozygotes.Table INumber of pups resulting from intercrossing of heterozygotes and the weight of each genotype at the age of 24 weeksSexGenotypeNumberBody weightMean ± S.D.

Representative growth curves in two pairs of such siblings are shown in Fig. 2 A. A cohort of 177 consecutive intercross-breeding was observed up to 12 months of age. During this period, PA28γ-deficient mice were fully viable and fertile. Analysis of the progeny from intercross-breeding showed that, at 24 weeks of age, the mean body weight of PA28γ−/− mice was significantly smaller than that of PA28γ+/+ mice in both sexes (p < 0.01, see Fig. 2 B and Table I). The mean body weight was intermediate in PA28γ+/− mice. To examine whether visceral organ size is proportional to the body weight we measured the wet weight of the heart, liver, spleen, thymus, kidney, and brain. The ratio of organ to body weight was consistently smaller in PA28γ−/− mice than in wild-type mice (data not shown). MEFs were prepared from PA28γ+/+ and PA28γ−/− embryos 13.5 days postcoitum, and their growth properties were examined in vitro. At passage 4, PA28γ−/− MEFs showed a significantly slower growth rate and a lower saturation density than their wild-type counterparts (Fig. 3 A). Single MEF size was measured using flow cytometry as forward scatter intensity. PA28γ−/− MEFs were slightly larger than wild-type ones (Fig. 3 B), consistent with the observation that they showed lower saturation densities. To investigate the cause of growth retardation, proliferating MEFs at the logarithmic phase were pulse-labeled with BrdUrd and analyzed by flow cytometry. As indicated in Fig. 4 A, PA28γ−/−cells showed an increase in the number of G1 phase cells and a decrease in the number of S phase cells relative to wild-type cells. To confirm this observation, MEFs synchronized at the G1 phase were continuously labeled with BrdUrd. The percentage of cells that entered the S phase was significantly smaller in PA28γ−/− cells than in wild-type cells (Fig. 4 B). These results indicate that entry into the S phase is slightly impeded in PA28γ−/− MEFs. We next examined whether the absence of PA28γ influences the expression of PA28α or PA28β. Western blot analysis using MEF extracts showed that the levels of neither PA28α nor PA28β are affected by the deficiency of PA28γ (Fig. 5 A). Under normal conditions, PA28α and PA28β are co-localized predominantly in the cytoplasm, whereas PA28γ occurs mainly in the nucleus (19Soza A. Knuehl C. Groettrup M. Henkliein P. Tanaka K. Kloetzel P.-M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 20Wojcik C. Paweletz N. Tanaka K. Wilk S. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 77: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, PA28α has two possible nuclear localization signals (27Kohda K. Ishibashi T. Shimbara N. Tanaka K. Matsuda Y. Kasahara M. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4923-4935PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it was of interest to examine whether the PA28α/β complex can enter the nucleus in the absence of PA28γ and compensate for the deficiency of PA28γ. As shown in Fig. 5 B, immunohistochemical analysis of PA28γ+/+ MEFs indicated that PA28γ is located predominantly in the nuclei excluding the nucleoli (upper right panel) as reported previously (19Soza A. Knuehl C. Groettrup M. Henkliein P. Tanaka K. Kloetzel P.-M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 20Wojcik C. Paweletz N. Tanaka K. Wilk S. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 77: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). No significant staining was observed in PA28γ−/− cells (lower right panel). On the other hand, the subcellular distribution of PA28α was essentially the same between PA28γ−/− and PA28γ+/+ MEFs (upper and lower left panels). Thus, the PA28α/β heteropolymer is unlikely to take over the function of PA28γ in PA28γ-deficient cells. In this report, we generated PA28γ-deficient mice by gene targeting (Fig. 1) and found that PA28γ affects body size, cell growth, and cell proliferation (Figs. 2 and 3). Flow cytometric analysis of MEFs (Fig. 4) revealed that the proportion of cells that entered the S phase was significantly lower in PA28γ−/−cells than in wild-type cells. The PA28γ homopolymer can associate with the 20 S proteasome (16Tanahashi N. Yokota K. Ahn J.Y. Chung C.H. Fujiwara T. Takahashi E. DeMartino G.N. Slaughter C.A. Toyonaga T. Yamamura K. Shimbara N. Tanaka K. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 195-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and stimulate the latent proteasome activity strongly (28Realini C. Jensen C.C. Zhang Z. Johnston S.C. Knowlton J.R. Hill C.P. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25483-25492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Thus, the phenotype of PA28γ-deficient mice raises the possibility that PA28γ might be involved in the degradation of nuclear proteins regulating cell cycle progression. For example, loss of PA28γ may delay the degradation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors such as p21cip1 and p27kip1, the degradation of which is required for G1 to S transition in the cell cycle (29Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5072) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the protein levels of p27 in PA28γ−/− and PA28γ+/+ MEFs by Western blot analysis but could not find any obvious difference (data not shown). A series of recent studies has established that the PA28α/β complex is involved in the generation of MHC class I ligands (reviewed in Refs.17Tanaka K. Kasahara M. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 161-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 18Fruh K. Yang Y. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, and 22Groettrup M. Ruppert T. Kuehn L. Seeger M. Standera S. Koszinowski U. Kloetzel P.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23808-23815Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether PA28γ-deficient mice show any abnormalities in their immune system. The cellularity and size of the spleen and thymus did not show any obvious difference between PA28γ−/− and wild-type mice (data not shown). Furthermore, disruption of the PA28γ gene did not alter the CD4/CD8 ratios in thymocytes and splenocytes, the T/B cell ratio in peripheral lymphocytes, or the expression level of cell surface MHC class I molecules (data not shown). These results indicate that PA28γ is unlikely to play a pivotal role in the MHC class I antigen processing/presentation system. This is consistent with the observation that PA28γ has been found in invertebrates that do not have the adaptive immune system (26Kandil E. Kohda K. Ishibashi T. Tanaka K. Kasahara M. Immunogenetics. 1997; 46: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, the present study does not rule out the possibility that PA28γ plays a specialized role in antigen presentation such as the processing of antigens in the nucleus. Because PA28γ localizes almost exclusively in the nucleus and is highly conserved between vertebrates and invertebrates, we supposed that PA28γ might have an essential role in maintaining cellular activities. Contrary to this initial expectation, PA28γ turned out to be dispensable. Subcellular localization of PA28α, and hence, that of the PA28α/β complex did not change significantly between PA28γ-deficient and wild-type cells (Fig. 5). Thus, it appears unlike that dispensability of PA28γ ensues from the compensation provided by the PA28α/β complex. A better understanding of the biological functions of the PA28 family proteins might be gained by creating mutant mice lacking all three members of this family. Such work is in progress in our laboratories."
https://openalex.org/W2062435249,"Iron transport across the plasma membrane appears to be a unidirectional process whereby iron uptake is essentially irreversible. One of the major sequestration sites for iron is the vacuole that stores a variety of metals, either as a mechanism to detoxify the cell or as a reservoir of metal to enable the cell to grow when challenged by a low iron environment. Exactly how the vacuole contributes to the overall iron metabolism of the cell is unclear because mutations that affect vacuolar function also perturb the assembly of the plasma membrane high affinity transport system composed of a copper-containing iron oxidase, Fet3p, and an Fe3+-specific iron transporter, Ftr1p. Here, we characterize the iron transporter homologue Fth1p, which is similar to the high affinity plasma membrane iron transporter Ftr1p. We found that Fth1p was localized to the vacuolar surface and, like other proteins that function on the vacuole, did not undergo Pep4-dependent degradation. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that Fth1p also associates with the Fet3p oxidase homologue, Fet5p; and disruption of the FET5 gene results in the accumulation of Fth1p in the endoplasmic reticulum. We also found that loss of this protein complex leads to elevated transcriptional activity of the FET3 gene and compromises the ability of the cell to switch from fermentative metabolism to respiratory metabolism. Because the Fet5 protein is oriented such that the oxidase domain of Fet5p is lumenal, this complex may be responsible for mobilizing intravacuolar stores of iron.

FET3encodes a multicopper iron oxidase, whereas FTR1 encodes a polytopic membrane protein that is thought to be a Fe3+-specific transporter. Together, Fet3p and Ftr1p are responsible for the transport of Fe2+ across the plasma membrane; the observation that a functional FET3 is required for Ftr1p to exit the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1 strongly indicates that this complex assembles in the ER prior to moving to the plasma membrane (4Stearman R.

The assembly of a functional Ftr1p-Fet3p complex is dependent on copper, which is supplied to the Fet3 protein by the copper-specific P-type ATPase Ccc2p and the copper-specific chaperone Atx1p.

Bridgham J.T. Zhao Z. Mattoon J.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 241: 447-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 6Greene J.R. Brown N.H. DiDomenico B.J. Kaplan J. Eide D.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 241: 542-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Also, mutations that disrupt vacuolar biogenesis result in similar defects (14Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22181-22187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The explanation for this effect is that these mutations alter the function or localization of the P-type ATPase Ccc2p, which in turn compromise the copper-dependent activation of Fet3p (7Davis-Kaplan S.R. Askwith C.C. Bengtzen A.C. Radisky D. Kaplan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13641-13645Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 8Gaxiola R.A. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. Fink G.R. Proc.

Chem. 1998; 273: 22181-22187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, how much these mutations would affect the capacity of the vacuole to store iron has not been examined directly, thus providing the possibility that these mutations may also perturb vacuolar storage function. Because the vacuole stores iron, we surmised that the vacuole may have a specific iron transport system. Here, we characterize the iron (Fe) transporter homologue, Fth1p, which is similar to the high affinity plasma membrane iron transporter Ftr1p (4Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). We found that Fth1p is localized to the vacuolar surface, and like other proteins that function on the vacuole, it does not undergo PEP4-dependent degradation. Fth1p also appears to associate with the Fet3p oxidase homologue, Fet5p, as disruption of the FET5 gene results in the accumulation of Fth1p in the ER. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation experiments show that Fet5p associates with Fth1p in detergent lysates. Finally, we find that disruption of the Fth1p-Fet5p complex alters iron homeostasis and can inhibit the transition from fermentative to respiratory metabolism.

A yeast strain (RGY3347) carrying a deletion of theFTH1 open reading frame (catalogue number 3347, BY4739-ybr207Δ: MATa fth1Δ::NEO leu2 lys2 ura3) was purchased from Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL). A fet5Δ disruption strain was made by amplifying theHIS3 gene from the plasmid pRS303 using the oligos: ATGTTGTTCTACTCGTTCGTGTGGTCTGTACTGGCCGCTAGTGTTGCTTTTTGTACTGAGAGTGCACCAT; GCCGCGAGAAACCTCTATTTCATTTTCAGCCAAGATTTCCCTTAACGTGTGGGTATTTCACACCGCATA. The resulting PCR fragment was transformed into SEY6210. Genomic DNA was prepared from His+ transformants by pelleting 1–2 optical density units of cells and incubating them in 300 μl of 50 mmTris, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, containing 10 μg/ml oxyliticase overnight to produce a cell lysate in which vacuolar proteases were allowed to digest cellular proteins. The cell lysate was then extracted with phenol-chloroform, and DNA was precipitated with the addition of ethanol and NaCl. Genomic DNA from putativefet5Δ::HIS3 mutants was then analyzed by PCR using oligos flanking the HIS3 gene insertion. Thefet5Δ::HIS3 deletion removes amino acids 17–620 from the FET5 open reading frame. A fet5Δ fth1Δ strain was made by amplifying the loci of the FTH1 gene from RGY3347 using oligos that hybridized 400 bp outside of either end of the FTH1 open reading frame. This PCR product (containing the KanMX4 neomycin resistance gene surrounded by a 400-bp sequence homologous to the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions of FTH1) was transformed into PLY1313. Neo+ colonies were confirmed for thefth1Δ::NEO disruption by PCR amplification of the genomic DNA. For metabolic shift experiments, cells were cultured in SD medium until they had reached mid-log phase (A 600 = 1). Cells were centrifuged and resuspended in SD medium containing 200 μm BPS and cultured for an additional 12 h. Cells were then washed with water, and 5 μl of a 1:10 serial dilution of each cell type was then plated onto minimal plates containing 10 μm BPS and 500 μm FeSO4 with either glucose or ethanol/glycerol (2:4%). Cells transformed with promoter-lacz fusion plasmids were grown in SD medium lacking uracil overnight to A 600 = 2.5. Cells were then diluted to an A 600 of 0.05 in SD-Ura medium containing supplements and grown for an additional 10 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation, and cell pellets were frozen at −20 °C. Cells were then resuspended in 1 ml of Z buffer (60 mm Na2PO4, 40 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, and 0.27% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol). 30 μl of CHCl3 and 20 μl of 10% SDS were added, and cells were vortexed and adjusted to 0.8 mg/mlo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactosidase. Cell suspensions were incubated for 10 min at 22 °C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 500 μl of 1 mNa2CO3, pH 11.0. Cells were pelleted, and supernatants were measured for absorbance at 405 nm. Each condition was measured in triplicate using three separate cultures derived from separate transformants for each plasmid. Immunofluorescence microscopy using anti-HA, anti-Vma2p, and anti-Kar2p was performed essentially as previously described (19Robinson J.S. Klionsky D.J. Banta L.M. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4936-4948Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown in selective SD medium and adjusted to 3.7% formaldehyde. After 30 min, cells were then resuspended and incubated in 4% fresh paraformaldehyde containing 50 mm KPO4 for 12 h. Cells were washed in 200 mm Tris, pH 8.0, + 20 mm EDTA + 1% β-mercaptoethanol, and then spheroplasted in 1.2 msorbitol, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 10 μg/ml oxyliticase for 30 min. Cells were then washed in 1.2 msorbitol, permeabilized for 60 s in 1% SDS, 1.2 msorbitol, and washed three times in 1.2 m sorbitol. Cells were then adhered to polylysine-coated glass slides prior to immunolabeling. For labeling with FM4-64 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), cells were labeled for 30 min at 30 °C in 500 nm FM4-64 in SD medium containing 50 mm KPO4, pH 7.5. Cells were then washed in water and cultured in unbuffered SD medium or yeast extract-peptone-dextrose for 30 min. Yeast cells harboring GFP-expressing plasmids were grown in SD medium to a density of 0.8–1.2. An 0.5 volume of GFP-KILL buffer (1 m Tris, pH 8.0, 5.0% sodium azide) was added to ensure that membrane traffic had ceased and that the GFP protein was kept at the optimal pH level for fluorescence detection. For some experiments, 10 μm DAPI was included in the GFP-KILL buffer. GFP fusion proteins were imaged using a 470-nm excitation filter, 495-nm dichroic mirror, and 525-nm emission filter. Images were captured with a Hammamatsu ORCA CCD camera mounted on an Olympus BX-60 microscope equipped with a 100× oil objective. Image sets were processed and overlaid using Adobe PhotoshopTM. Plasmid pJLU54 was transformed into MC1061Escherichia coli, which were then induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside as described previously (22Piper R.C. Whitters E.A. Stevens T.H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 65: 305-318PubMed Google Scholar, 23Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene. 1998; 67: 31-40Crossref Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). The resulting recombinant GST-GFP fusion protein was purified over glutathione-agarose, dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline, and used to immunize rabbits. Anti-GFP antibodies were affinity purified over an Affi-Gel 10/15 column to which was attached the GST-GFP fusion protein according to manufacturer's directions (Bio-Rad). Polyclonal anti-GST antibodies were purified from serum from rabbits immunized with irrelevant GST fusion proteins over an Affi-Gel 10/15 column to which was attached the GST protein alone. The mouse anti-Vma2p (13D11) and anti-ALP (Pho8p; 1D3) monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes. The polyclonal anti-HA antibody was a kind gift of Kathryn Hill and Tom Stevens (University of Oregon, Eugene, OR). The monoclonal anti-HA antibody 16B12 and the monoclonal anti-6xHis antibody, which recognizes an epitope composed of six tandem histidine residues, was purchased from Babco (Berkeley, CA). Rabbit polyclonal anti-Kar2p was a kind gift of Mark Rose (Princeton University). Texas Red-labeled secondary antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Digoxin labeling of antibodies was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions using a digoxin labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Whole cell lysates from growing cultures of yeast cells were made by pelleting yeast, washing the pellet once with water, and resuspending it in 50 mm Tris, pH 6.5, 8m urea, 2% SDS. Glass beads (150–200 μm) were added, and the sample was vortexed for 2 min. Samples were then adjusted to 1× Laemmli sample buffer (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). For screening for the presence of the HA epitope, colonies were transferred into wells of a 96-well microtiter plate containing 50 mm Tris, pH 6.5, 5% SDS, 8m urea, and 10% β-mercaptoethanol. The dish was then incubated at 65 °C for 5 min prior to loading the resulting samples. To make whole membrane fractions, yeast cells were washed in water and resuspended in 200 mm Tris, pH 9.0, 0.05% sodium azide, containing 10 mm dithiothreitol, and incubated for 5 min at 25 °C. Cells were then pelleted and resuspended in 10 ml of 1.2m sorbitol, 50 mm KPO4, containing 10 μg/ml oxyliticase, and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The spheroplasts were then layered onto a sucrose cushion (1.2m sucrose, 20 mm HEPEPS, pH 7.2, 2 mm EDTA) and collected as a pellet after centrifugation at 7,000 × g for 20 min. Cells were lysed in 700 mm sorbitol, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, and 2 mm EDTA. Postnuclear supernatants were generated by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min, and the membranes were isolated by centrifuging the postnuclear supernatants at 40,000 × g for 30 min in a Beckman TLA-45 rotor. Yeast spheroplasts were made from 100 ml of yeast culture grown in minimal medium toA 600 = 1.0 as described above. The spheroplast pellet was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, 1 mmEDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture (CompleteTM, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cell lysates were then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was removed and added to tubes containing affinity-purified anti-GFP antibody, affinity-purified anti-GST antibody, anti-HA monoclonal antibody 16B12, or the monoclonal anti-6xHis antibody. Extracts were incubated on ice for 2 h after which 50 μl of protein G-coupled Sepharose was added (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). After 60 min, beads were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100. Samples were then solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting using a mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody or digoxin-labeled rabbit anti-GFP antibody to assess the amount of HA- and GFP-tagged protein immunoprecipitated by the rabbit polyclonal antibodies. A polyclonal anti-HA was used to assess the amount of HA-tagged protein precipitated with the monoclonal anti-HA antibody. All PCR amplifications performed to obtain gene fragments were done using genomic DNA prepared from SEY6210. All PCR fragments were generated using the High Fidelity PCR kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The plasmid pALP-GFP3–3′UT1 (pPL650) consisting of a NotI/BamHI fragment composed of bp-(440–1698) of PHO8, aBamHI/EcoRI fragment of mutant 3 GFP (21Cormack BP Microbiology. 1997; 143: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar) bp-(1–714), and an EcoRI/KpnI fragment of the 3′UT of the PHO8 gene (bp-(1701–3530)) in the polylinker of pRS316 was used as the vector for tagging various open reading frames with GFP. The plasmid was made by serially subcloning PCR fragments generated with High Fidelity polymerase using the oligos: CACGCGGCCGCACAAGGGAAGCAGGCCTCTTGC; CACGGATCCTGGTCAACTCATGGTAGTATTC; CACGGATCCTGTCTAAAGGTGAAGGAATTATTC; GAAGAATTCTTATTTGTACAATTCATCCAT; CACGAATTCACGAATTCCCTATCTAAGTGTCCCTCTTTTTTC; and TCCAGGGATATCGAAAAAATC. pJLU34, which encodes a Ste3-GFP fusion protein, was made by subcloning a PCR fragment composed of bp-(368–1411) of STE3 into theNotI/BamHI sites of pPL650 using the oligonucleotides CAGCGCGGCCGCGGTTAGAAGCGCTGGTACAATTTTCTCT and CCTGGATCCTAGGGCCTGCAGTATTTTCTGAACTA. pJLU36, which encodes a Fet4-GFP fusion protein, was made by subcloning a PCR fragment composed of bp-(495–1656) of FET4 into theNotI/BamHI sites of pPL650 using the oligonucleotides CAGCGCGGCCGCGTTGAGCCTTATTGGGGCGTAAATCA and CCTGGATCCTTTTTTCCAACATCATAACCTCTGGGAA. pJLU40, which encodes a Vph1-GFP fusion protein, was made by subcloning a PCR fragment composed of bp-(346–2521) of VPH1 into theNotI/BamHI sites of pPL650 using the oligonucleotides CAGCGCGGCCGCGGTTGCAGATTGAAATGTCATCACG and CCTGGATCCTGCTTGAAGCGGAAGAGCTTGCACTAGC. pJLU50, which encodes a Fth1-GFP fusion protein, was made by subcloning a PCR fragment composed of bp-(345–1396) of FTH1 into theNotI/BamHI sites of pPL650 using the oligonucleotides CAGCGCGGCCGCGTCAGCAGGAAATTACAAGCTTCCACC and CTCGAGGATCCAATTTGCTGAACCACTGCTATCAATTAT. pJLU38, which encodes a Fet5-GFP fusion protein, was made by subcloning a PCR fragment composed of bp-(232–1866) of FET5 into theNotI/BamHI sites of pPL650 using the oligonucleotides CAGCGCGGCCGCGATTCGAGTCCTCAGGTACTCAAAAGA and CCTGGATCCTGCCGCGAGAAACCTCTATTTCATTTTCAG. pJLU73, which carries the FTH1-GFP fusion gene in aLEU2-containing, centromere-based vector, was made by cotransforming pJLU50, which had been cut with PvuII along with pRS315, which had been linearized. Yeast colonies that contained the correct recombinant plasmid were identified by screening Leu+ Ura+ transformants for the presence of GFP by fluorescence microscopy. The plasmid was then rescued by selecting for ampicillin resistant E. coli transformed with genomic DNA prepared from the respective Leu+ Ura+ GFP+ yeast. pJLU61 was made by generating a PCR fragment containing a 6X-HA epitope that also had ends that overlapped the insertion site of GFP within pJLU38. This fragment was generated using the template pRCP48 (22Piper R.C. Whitters E.A. Stevens T.H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 65: 305-318PubMed Google Scholar) with the oligos: CCACACGTTAAGGGAAATCTTGGCTGAAAATGAAATAGAGGTTTCTCGCGGCATGGATTCTATTAGATCT and AAATTATAACGTATTAAATAATATGTGAAAAAAGAGGGACACTTAGATAGGGCATGCACATAGAAGGATC. The fragment was then cotransformed with pJLU38 in which the GFP had been excised by cutting with BamHI and EcoRI. Ura+ GFP− transformants were then screened for the presence of the HA epitope by immunoblot. This procedure resulted in a plasmid, pJLU61, that encoded a Fet5 fusion protein containing the following additional amino acids prior to the stop codon: DSIRSADLGRIF (YPYDVPDYAG)3AAQCGPDLGRIF(YPYDVPDYAG)3 AAQCGPD. The predicted amino acid sequences of the Fth1-GFP, Pho8-GFP, and Fet5-HA fusion proteins were confirmed by DNA sequencing of the respective plasmids. pJLU54 was made by subcloning theBamHI/EcoRI fragment from pPL650 (encoding mutant 3 GFP) into the BamHI/EcoRI site of pGEX-3X (22Piper R.C. Whitters E.A. Stevens T.H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 65: 305-318PubMed Google Scholar). The β-galactosidase promoter fusion constructs (pJLU65, pJLU62, pJLU68) were made by subcloning anEcoRI/BamHI-restricted PCR fragment containing the start codon and 500 bp upstream of the FTH1,FET3, and FET4 genes, respectively, into the β-galactosidase vector pSEYC102. To ensure the sequence of FTH1 was correct, we fully sequenced the FTH1 plasmid (pJLU47) and a duplicate clone (pJLU48), as well as a full-length PCR product amplified and analyzed independently. Several changes from the original sequence were noted and submitted to GenBankTM (accession number AF177330). We validated the authenticity of the various GFP constructs by complementation: Vph1-GFP could restore vacuolar acidification to avph1Δ mutant; Ste3-GFP could restore mating efficiency to a ste3Δ mutant; and GFP-PHO8 was found to traffic appropriately to the vacuole in anAPM3-dependent manner. 2J. Urbanowski, D. Swartz, and R. C. Piper, unpublished data. We tagged Fth1p with the green fluorescent protein as part of a separate study to find membrane protein markers of different subcellular compartments. Surprisingly, we found Fth1p localized to the vacuole and went on to characterize this protein further. Using a set of GFP-tagged constructs, we found that Fth1p tagged with GFP at the C terminus was clearly localized to the limiting membrane of the vacuole, where it colocalized with the endocytic tracer FM4-64 that was allowed to transit to the vacuole for 1 h (Fig. 1). Despite localization to the vacuole, these data did not necessarily indicate that Fth1p functions at the vacuole. Indeed, overexpression of many membrane proteins that function elsewhere, such as the Golgi apparatus or plasma membrane, can accumulate within the vacuole upon overexpression or upon deletion of Golgi-targeting motifs. This phenomenon is most apparent in cells lacking the vacuole proteases that allow these proteins to accumulate without degradation. Recently, it has been found that membrane proteins destined for degradation in the vacuole actually localize within the lumen of the vacuole, whereas other proteins that function at the vacuole are localized to the vacuole surface (24Ordorizzi G. Babst M. Emr S.D. Cell. 1998; 95: 847-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Other examples of this type of intravacuolar localization of proteins destined for degradation have been found previously (25Berkower C. Loayza D. Michaelis S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1185-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 26Cooper A. Bussey H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2706-2714Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 27Davis N.G. Horecka J.L.

Thus, to further examine the subcellular distribution of Fth1p, we compared the labeling pattern of Fth1-GFP to a panel of GFP fusion proteins made with either proteins known to function at the vacuole or proteins known to undergoPEP4-dependent degradation in the vacuole. This analysis was performed in a pep4 mutant strain that lacked vacuole proteases to ensure that proteins localized to the interior of the vacuole could be visualized. In the case of Fth1p, Fth1-GFP could clearly be seen on the vacuole surface in Pep+ andpep4 mutant cells, indi"

CD95 ligation leads to clustering of the receptor cytoplasmic “death domains” and recruitment of the zymogen form of caspase-8 to the cell surface. Activation of this protease through self-cleavage, followed by activation of downstream effector caspases, culminates in cleavage of a set of cellular proteins resulting in apoptosis with disassembly of the cell. It is very well known that the extracellular region of the CD95 receptor is required for CD95L interaction and that the death domain is necessary for the induction of the apoptotic signaling. Here, we identified and characterized a novel CD95 ligand- and death domain-independent oligomerization domain mapping to the NH2-terminal extracellular region of the CD95 receptor. In vitro andin vivo studies indicated that this domain, conserved among all soluble CD95 variants, mediates homo-oligomerization of the CD95 receptor and of the soluble CD95 proteins, as well as hetero-oligomerization of the receptor with the soluble variants. These results offer new insight into the mechanism of apoptosis inhibition mediated by the soluble CD95 proteins and suggest a role of the extracellular oligomerization domain in the regulation of the non-signaling state of the CD95 receptor.

Moreover, alterations in the control of apoptosis, also mediated by the CD95/CD95L system, are involved in the pathogenesis of several diseases such as Hashimoto thyroiditis (10Giordano C. Stassi G.

Thus, it is particularly interesting to elucidate the mechanisms that regulate CD95 and CD95L interactions. A common feature of the death receptors is that, upon binding to cognate ligands or agonistic antibodies, the receptors homo-oligomerize through the death domain and recruit adaptor and effector cytoplasmic proteins to the cell surface (2Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5169) Google Scholar).

Thus, the common view today is that the extracellular region of the CD95 receptor is crucial for CD95L interaction while the intracytoplasmic death domain is required for CD95 receptor trimerization and for induction of apoptotic signaling. However, characterization of CD95 isoforms indicate an NH2-terminal extracellular domain as a potential novel ligand-independent oligomerization domain. Several Fas/Apo-1 mRNAs have been identified by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR in human activated peripheral mononuclear cells and in hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic tumor cell lines (23Cheng J. Zhou T. Liu C. Shapiro J.P. Brauer M.J. Kiefer M.C. Barr P.J. Mountz J.D. Science. 1994; 263: 1759-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar, 24Cascino I. Fiucci G. Papoff G. Ruberti G. J.

Lynch D.H. Ruberti G. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4622-4630PubMed Google Scholar). Such variants derive by alternative splicing of the primary transcript, and a descriptive nomenclature based on the exons deleted has been previously proposed (26Papoff G. Cascino I. Eramo A. Starace G. Lynch D.H. Ruberti G. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4622-4630PubMed Google Scholar). With the exception of FasΔExo6 (also called FasΔTM), in all other variants (FasΔExo4; FasΔExo4,6; FasΔExo3,4; FasΔExo3,4,6) the deletions result in an altered reading frame with the introduction of a premature termination codon. Thus, these splicing variants code for smaller CD95 proteins with deletions in the extracellular region and with a novel sequence of 21 or 38 amino acids at the COOH-terminal end (24Cascino I. Fiucci G. Papoff G. Ruberti G. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 2706-2713PubMed Google Scholar, 26Papoff G. Cascino I. Eramo A. Starace G. Lynch D.H. Ruberti G. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4622-4630PubMed Google Scholar). Such soluble CD95 isoforms are actively secreted from the cells and block in vitro the apoptosis induced by both the agonistic antibody, CH-11, or by the natural CD95L in CD95-positive sensitive cell lines (24Cascino I. Fiucci G. Papoff G. Ruberti G. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 2706-2713PubMed Google Scholar, 26Papoff G. Cascino I. Eramo A. Starace G. Lynch D.H. Ruberti G. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4622-4630PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, all isoforms with deletions in the extracellular regions are lacking the CH-11 agonistic antibody (27Fadeel B. Thorpe C.J. Chiodi F. Int. Immunol. 1995; 7: 1967-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and the CD95L (28Starling G.C. Bajorath J. Emswiler J. Ledbetter J.A. Aruffo A. Kiener P.A. J. Exp.

Alternatively, we proposed that the soluble isoforms bind to the CD95 receptor, thus interfering with homotrimer formation and with apoptotic signaling (the “inactive heterotrimer” model) (26Papoff G. Cascino I. Eramo A. Starace G. Lynch D.H. Ruberti G. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4622-4630PubMed Google Scholar, 31Ruberti G. Cascino I. Papoff G. Eramo A. Adv Exp Med Biol. 1996; 406: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the NH2-terminal 49 amino acids of the mature CD95 receptor is the only region conserved among all soluble isoforms and thus is likely to be implicated in this functional anti-apoptotic property. In this study we provide evidence that a CD95L-independent oligomerization domain does exist in the extracellular region of the CD95 receptor and that this maps to the NH2-terminal 49 amino acids of the receptor. Moreover, the ability of the CD95 receptor to self-associate through such a domain does not require an intact cytoplasmic death domain. The oligomerization domain, conserved among all CD95 variants, may mediate both homo-oligomerization of the CD95 receptor and of the soluble CD95 proteins and hetero-oligomerization of the receptor with the soluble variants modulating the apoptotic signaling. The human T leukemia cell line HuT78 and the human embryonic kidney 293T cells were cultured, respectively, in RPMI 1640 and in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10 mm Hepes, antibiotics, and 5% fetal bovine serum. The BW cells were maintained in RPMI with the addition of nonessential amino acids, sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 500 μg/ml active G418 (Geneticin; Life Technologies, Inc.). Anti-CD95 antibodies were DX2, IgG1 mouse monoclonal; Apo-1, IgG3 mouse monoclonal (kindly provided by Dr. P. H. Krammer); M24, IgG1 mouse monoclonal (kindly provided by Dr. D. H. Lynch), reactive with the CD95 receptor and with all CD95 variants containing an intact NH2-terminal domain (26Papoff G. Cascino I. Eramo A. Starace G. Lynch D.H. Ruberti G. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4622-4630PubMed Google Scholar); and CH-11, IgM mouse monoclonal (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY). Anti-FADD was from Transduction Laboratories, anti-HA antibody (12CA5) was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and anti-FLAG (M2) was from Eastman Kodak Co. Anti-glutathione S-transferase (GST) polyclonal antibody was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and anti-FLICE (caspase-8) (C15, IgG2a) was kindly provided by Dr. P. H. Krammer. The conjugated secondary antibodies were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech or Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc. HuT78 cells (3–5 × 104cells/well) were treated with 400 ng/ml CH-11 antibody, with various concentrations of GST-CD95 or GST-free recombinant proteins produced inEscherichia coli and dialyzed in PBS. Then, the cells were processed for apoptosis induction with propidium iodide staining and flow cytometric analysis as described previously (32Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. of Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4431) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cell pellet was resuspended in a hypotonic fluorochrome solution (50 μg/ml propidium iodide in 0.1% sodium citrate plus 0.1% Triton X-100), the nuclei were analyzed using a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA), and the percentage of hypoploid nuclei was evaluated. Expression constructs were made in pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen Corp., San Diego, CA) inserting sequences encoding peptide epitopes, which are recognized by commercially available monoclonal antibodies, into the sequence of CD95 mutants. The FLAG or the HA epitope were positioned such that they would be present at the amino terminus of the CD95 proteins after cleavage of the signal peptide. The following plasmids, produced by PCR, were transiently transfected in 293T cells: pcDNA3FLAG-CD95, previously described (33Hausler P. Papoff G. Eramo A. Reif K. Cantrell D.A. Ruberti G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), pcDNA3HA-sCD95 coding for the smaller splicing variant (FasΔExo3,4,6), pcDNA3HA-B1 coding for a truncated receptor lacking the death domain (CD95Δ202–319) and corresponding to FasΔExo8 splicing variant (34Cascino I. Papoff G. De Maria R. Testi R. Ruberti G. J Immunol. 1996; 156: 13-17PubMed Google Scholar), pcDNA3FLAG-CD95ExtraΔ1–42 coding for a receptor lacking the NH2-terminal 42 amino acids. A 60% confluent 100-mm plate of 293T cells was transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation following standard protocols with 10 μg of total DNA and harvested 24 h later. Cells were washed, scraped, and lysed in a lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin. After 20 min on ice, the cell lysates were pelleted by centrifugation and the supernatants were incubated with anti-FLAG M2 or anti-HA antibodies bound to protein G-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with washing buffers (first with the lysis buffer, followed by a lysis buffer containing one-tenth of the lysis buffer detergent and finally in lysis buffer without detergent), and the immune complexes were eluted by boiling in a standard reducing sample buffer for 5 min and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). For detection by Western blotting, immunoprecipitated proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred to Hybond nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), blocked with 5% (w/v) dry milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.2% (v/v) Tween 20 (TTBS), and, after washing with TTBS, incubated with the primary specific antibody in TTBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing blots with TTBS, they were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies in TTBS plus 2% BSA and detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The DNA fragments corresponding to various fragments of the human CD95 receptor were obtained by PCR amplification using primers containing restriction sites for cloning (Table I, restriction sites are underlined, bold indicates the stop codons, and numbering is according to Itoh et al. (35Itoh N. Yonehara S. Ishii A. Yonehara M. Mizushima S Sameshima M. Hase A. Seto Y. Nagata S. Cell. 1991; 66: 233-243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2678) Google Scholar)). CD95Extra, CD95ExtraΔ1–42, CD95ExtraΔ1–69, and CD95Intra DNA fragments were ligated into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of the pEG202 expression vector in frame with the LexA open reading frame and then the DNAs excised with EcoRI and SalI and subcloned into pBTM116 in frame with LexA. The sCD95 DNA was cloned directly in the BamHI site of pBTM116. Moreover, CD95Extra, CD95Intra, sCD95, and 49NCD95 PCR products were also cloned in theBamHI site of pVP16. The 49NCD95 BamHI andNotI insert of pVP16 was subcloned in pEG202 and the DNA excised with BamHI and SalI and subcloned into pBTM116 in frame with LexA. We used the following combinations of primers, indicated in Table I, to produce DNA fragments coding for the CD95 mutant proteins indicated in Fig. 1: (a) GR99 or GR131 and GR102, CD95Extra; (b) GR137 and GR102, CD95ExtraΔ1–42; (c) GR143 and GR102, CD95ExtraΔ1–69; (d) GR103 or GR141 and GR104, CD95Intra; (e) GR131 and GR119, sCD95; (f) GR131 and GR105, 49NCD95. All results were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Two-hybrid interaction assays in L40 strain cells with pBTM116 and pVP16 constructs were performed essentially as described (36Fields S.

Clones that formed on His-deficient media (His+) were tested for the ability to trans-activate alacZ reporter gene by liquid culture β-galactosidase assays with ONPG (o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside) as substrate following standard protocols. β-Galactosidase units were defined as indicated in Table III.Table IDNA sequence of the oligonucleotidesGR99CCCGGAATTCAGATTATCGTCCAAAAGTGHFas (243–261)GR131CCCGGGATCCGATTATCGTCCAAAAGTGHFas (244–261)GR100CCCGGAATTCGCCATGAGATTATCGTCCAAAAGTGHFas (243–261)GR101CCCGGGATCCAGATTATCGTCCAAAAGTGHFas (243–261)GR137CCCGGAATTCTGCCATAAGCCCTGTCCTCCAHFas (369–389)GR105CCCGTGATCA TGGAGGACAGGGCTTATHFas (389–373)GR143CCCGGAATTCTGCCAAGAAGGGAAGGAGTACHFas (447–467)GR102CCCGTGATCA GTTAGATCTGGATCCTTCHFas (713–696)GR103CCCGGAATTCAAGAGAAAGGAAGTACAHFas (765–781)GR141GGCGGATCCCCAAGAGAAAGGAAGTACAHFas (765–781)GR119CCCGTGATCA AATTTATTGCCACTGTTTCAGGHFas (864–843)GR104CCCGTGATCA CTAGACCAAGCTTTGGATHFas (1202–1185)GR87GCTCTAGACTACAGGACTGAGAAGAAGTHFasL (130–149)GR88GCTCTAGAACATTCTCGGTGCCTGTAACHFasL (1091–1072) Open table in a new tab Table IIIβ-Galactosidase assaypBTM116pVP16CD95ExtrasCD9549NCD95CD95IntraCD95Extra0.0950.1010.0970.011sCD950.1060.0770.0790.01249NCD950.0740.1080.0980.022CD95Intra0.0100.0100.0110.120CD95ExtraΔ1–420.0190.0080.0090.017CD95ExtraΔ1–690.0140.0080.0130.008 Open table in a new tab The DNA fragments, described above, corresponding to CD95Extra, CD95Intra, CD95ExtraΔ1–42, and CD95ExtraΔ1–69 were subcloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pGEX-4T-1 in frame with the open reading frame of GST. sCD95 and 49NCD95 were PCR-amplified, respectively, with the GR101/GR119 or the GR101/GR105 primer pairs (Table I) and cloned in the BamHI site of the pGEX-4T-1. Constructs were transformed into E. coli strain BL21 (DE3), and fusion proteins expressed by induction with 0.1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were lysed on ice by mild sonication and then subjected to centrifugations at 4 °C. The supernatant was aliquoted and frozen at −70 °C. One aliquot of each protein extract was used to determine the concentration of GST and GST fusion proteins. Protein concentrations were determined by estimating the concentration of Coomassie-stained proteins, which were electrophoretically resolved by SDS-PAGE. The level of expression for GST and GST fusion protein varies. Therefore, to perform binding experiments, different amounts of bacterial lysates were used to purify the GST proteins and to obtain approximately 5 μg of protein adsorbed to 10 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads as suggested by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GST fusion proteins were also eluted using the glutathione elution buffer or the proteins cleaved on the matrix with the thrombin protease to liberate the protein of interest from the GST moiety following manufacturer's instructions. Such proteins following extensive dialysis against 1× PBS at 4 °C were used in apoptosis inhibition assays and in gel filtration experiments. The sCD95 GST-free product following dialysis in sodium borate buffer (0.1 m, pH 8.8) was also biotinylated. Briefly, a purified sCD95 protein (1–3 mg/ml in sodium borate buffer) was incubated at room temperature for 4 h with N-hydroxysuccinimide biotin (50 μg of biotin/mg of protein). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 4 μl of 1 m NH4Cl/50 μg of ester and incubation for 10 min at room temperature. Finally, the protein was extensively dialyzed against 1× PBS to remove uncoupled biotin. The CD95ExtraEcoRI-BclI DNA fragment was PCR-amplified with the GR100, which includes a translation start site, and the GR102 synthetic oligonucleotides and cloned into the EcoRI andBamHI sites of the pBluescript II KS vector (Stratagene) (Table I). CD95L was PCR-amplified with the GR87 and GR88 oligonucleotides (numbering is according to Mita et al.(37Mita E. Hayashi N. Iio S. Takehara T. Hijioka T. Kasahara A. Fusamoto H. Kamada T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 468-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar); Table I) and cloned into theXbaI site of pcDNA3 expression vector. AU1FADD pCDNA3 plasmid was kindly donated by Dr. V. M. Dixit. The linearized plasmids were transcribed in vitro using T3 or T7 RNA polymerase under conditions recommended by the Promega Protocols and Application Guide. RNA was purified, ethanol-precipitated, and stored at −70 °C. To generate radioactively labeled proteins,in vitro translation was performed using 1–2 μg of CD95Extra and FADD RNA/50-μl reaction for 120 min at 30 °C using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) andl-[35S]methionine (800 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For CD95L in vitro translation, wheat germ extract (Promega) was used in a 50-μl reaction for 120 min at 25 °C. The labeled proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Gels were fixed, treated with 1 m sodium salicylate for 30 min, dried, and fluorographed. The assay was performed essentially as described previously (38Sessa G. Morelli G Ruberti I. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3507-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). An aliquot (0.1–0.2 μl) of in vitro translated material was subjected directly to SDS-PAGE, or the in vitro translated protein reactions (10–20 μl) were diluted in 200 μl of binding buffer and incubated with the various GST fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose (approximately 5 μg of protein on 10 μl of beads) diluted in 100 μl of binding buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mg/ml BSA) for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed four times in 150 mm NaCl, 16 mm Na2HPO47H2O, 4 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 7.3), 0.1% Nonidet P-40 at 4 °C. The bound proteins were then eluted with SDS-containing sample buffer, and one-fifth of each sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE and fluorography. In the competition assays, 1 μg of cold sCD95, GST-cleaved product, was used in the binding reactions. The binding assays were also performed by incubating a biotinylated sCD95 protein with the GST fusion proteins. The bound proteins were analyzed on SDS-PAGE transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, incubated with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase, and developed using ECL chemiluminescence system. Cromatography purified GST-CD95 fusion proteins (250 μg of GST-CD95Extra, GST-sCD95, GST-49NCD95, and GST-CD95ExtraΔ1–42, in 50 μl of PBS) were labeled with 125I (400 μCi in 4 μl of NaOH, Nycomed-Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min in a vial coated with IODOGEN® (Pierce) (40 μg/vial) (39Signore A. Chianelli M. Toscano A. Monetini L. Ronga G. Nimmon C.C. Britton K.E. Pozzilli P. Negri M. Nucl. Med Commun. 1992; 13: 713-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). After labeling, peptides were purified from free 125I using a gel filtration chromatography column (G25, PD10, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) eluted with PBS. The fraction containing the radiolabeled peptide was stored at 4 °C with 1% human serum albumin until binding assay. For binding assays, HuT78 or BWtTA or BWtTAFF3 cells (1 × 105 cells in 20 μl of PBS + 1% human serum albumin) were incubated in duplicate in a 96-well plate at 4 °C for 30 min with increasing concentrations of radiolabeled peptide (final concentrations ranging from 10−11 to 10−7m). Nonspecific binding was assessed by repeating the same binding in presence of 10−6m unlabeled peptide. After incubation, cells were harvested and centrifuged for 1 min at 10,000 rpm in a 400-μl conical vial (Beckman) over a layer of 150 μl of dibutylphthalate oil and mineral light oil (87.5:12.5, v/v) (40Robb R.J. Greene W.C. Rusk C.M. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 1126-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). After centrifugation, vials were frozen by dipping in liquid N2 and the tip of the vial was then cut and counted for radioactivity. Scatchard plot analysis was performed on the available results using the Ligand 2.0 (Biosoft) computer program (kindly donated by Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London, United Kingdom). A Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was equilibrated with 1× PBS and calibrated with β-amylase (200 kDa), yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), chicken egg albumin (45 kDa), cytochromec (12 kDa), and aprotinin (6.5 kDa). The GST fusion proteins or the GST-cleaved ones produced in E. coli as described above were extensively dialyzed against PBS, then 500 ng were applied to the column and eluted with 1× PBS at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. Fractions (0.4 ml) were collected loaded on a SDS-PAGE gel, and the position of CD95 proteins in the elution profile was determined by immunoblotting with M24, a murine monoclonal antibody reacting with the 49 NH2-terminal amino acids of the CD95 receptor (26Papoff G. Cascino I. Eramo A. Starace G. Lynch D.H. Ruberti G. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4622-4630PubMed Google Scholar) or the GST-specific polyclonal antibody. Cells were washed twice in HBS and divided into two aliquots (107 cells/ml); one remained untreated, and one was pretreated with the membrane-impermeable cross-linker Sulfo-EGS (Pierce) at a final concentration of 2 mm. After 10 min of incubation at room temperature, cross-linking was quenched by glycine addition (final concentration of 0.1 m, pH 7.5) to both aliquots. Fifteen min later cells were centrifuged at 4 °C and lysed by Tris-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin. Lysates were incubated for 1 h with primary monoclonal antibody (DX-2, monoclonal anti-CD95, or monoclonal anti-HA for control). Immuncomplexes were collected by protein G-Sepharose (Sigma), washed four times in lysis buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Blots were also stained by Ponceau Red in order to identify the antibody bands. The treatment of HuT78 to induce DISC"

Stimulation of a large variety of cell surface receptors results in the rapid activation of Rap1,i.e. an increase in the GTP-bound form. This activation is mediated by second messengers like calcium, cAMP, and diacylglycerol, but additional pathways may exist as well. Here we describe a ubiquitously expressed guanine nucleotide exchange factor of 200 kDa that activates Rap1 both in vivo and in vitro. This exchange factor has two putative regulatory domains: a domain with an amino acid sequence related to cAMP-binding domains and a PDZ domain. Therefore, we named it PDZ-GEF1. PDZ-GEFs are closely related to Epacs, Rap-specific exchange factors with a genuine cAMP binding site, that are directly regulated by cAMP. The domain related to cAMP-binding domains, like the cAMP binding site in Epac, serves as a negative regulatory domain. However, PDZ-GEF1 does not interact with cAMP or cGMP. Interestingly, PDZ-GEF1 also activates Rap2, a close relative of Rap1. This is the first example of an exchange factor acting on Rap2. We conclude that PDZ-GEF1 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, specific for Rap1 and Rap2, that is controlled by a negative regulatory domain.

A. 1998; 95: 7475-7479Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Because Rap1 has an effector domain that is very similar to Ras, some of these effects may be mediated, by either positive or negative interference in Ras signaling. Indeed it was shown that Rap1 can regulate extracellular signal-regulated kinases both positively (5Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar) and negatively (6Cook S.J. Rubinfeld B. Albert I. McCormick F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3475-3485Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), presumably by interacting with the Ras effectors Raf1 and B-raf. Also Ral GEFs,1 other effectors of Ras, are able to interact with Rap1 (7Herrmann C. Horn G. Spaargaren M. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6794-6800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 8Spaargaren M. Bischoff J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 605-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This additional function is still largely elusive. The function of Rap2, a very close relative of Rap1, is also unknown, although Rap2 is able to bind to the same effectors as Rap1 (13Nancy V. Wolthuis R.M.F. de Tand M.-F. Janoueix-Lerosey I. Bos J.L. de Gunzburg J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8737-8745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition, Rap2 binds to a specific putative effector, RPIP8 (14Janoueix-Lerosey I. Pasheva E. de Tand M.F. Tavitian A. de Gunzburg J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 290-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Rap1 is activated in various cell types by a variety of stimuli. In fibroblasts, Rap1 is rapidly activated after stimulation with growth factors like platelet-derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor, endothelin, lysophosphatidic acid, and bombesin (10Zwartkruis F.J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 24297-24300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In blood platelets, Rap1 activation is induced by thrombin and other factors that regulate platelet activation (2Franke B. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar); in neutrophils by chemokines and cytokines like f-Met-Leu-Phe, platelet-activating factor, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and tumor necrosis factor-α (15M'Rabet L.

M'Rabet and J. L. Bos, personal communication. 2L. M'Rabet and J. L. Bos, personal communication. The activation of Rap1 by extracellular stimuli is mediated by different signaling pathways depending on the receptor and the cell type. The best characterized pathways are those that use the second messengers, calcium diacylglycerol and cAMP (2Franke B. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 10Zwartkruis F.J. Wolthuis R.M. Nabben N.M. Franke B. Bos J.L.

Chem. 1995; 270: 10373-10376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, elusive pathways, independent of these second messengers, do exist (15M'Rabet L. Coffer P. Zwartkruis F. Franke B. Segal A.W. Koenderman L. Bos J.L. Blood. 1998; 92: 2133-2140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).2 Three families of guanine nucleotide exchange factors have been identified that control the activation of Rap1. First, C3G, which may control tyrosine kinase-induced activation of Rap1 through the adapter proteins Crk and Cbl (16Reedquist K.A. Bos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4944-4949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 19Ishiki M. Sasaoka T. Ishihara H. Imamura T. Usui I. Takata Y. Kobayashi M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 8564-8569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Second, the GRPs, which contain calcium and diacylglycerol binding motifs (21Ebinu J.O. Bottorff D.A. Chan E.Y. Stang S.L. Dunn R.J. Stone J.C. Science. 1998; 280: 1082-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). From this family, HCDC25L (22Kedra D. Seroussi E. Fransson I. Trifunovic J. Clark M. Lagercrantz J. Blennow E. Mehlin H. Dumanski J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 100: 611-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), also called CalDAG-GEFI (23Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Toki S. Canales J.J. Harlan P. Blumenstiel J.P. Chen E.J. Bany I.A. Mochizuki N. Ashbacher A. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13278-13283Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), is Rap1-specific and responsive to both of these second messengers. Finally, the Epac family, Rap-specific GEFs that are directly regulated by cAMP (24de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J. Verheijen M.H. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1621) Google Scholar, 25Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Mochizuki N. Toki S. Nakaya M. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. Science. 1998; 282: 2275-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar). Interestingly, for both DAG and cAMP, these GEFs represent novel targets that mediate signal transduction independent from the classical targets protein kinase C and protein kinase A. To further identify GEFs that may be specific for Rap1 we searched data bases and found a conserved family of genes, which we named PDZ-GEFs. The encoded proteins contain the characteristic Ras exchange motif and GEF sequences present in all GEFs for the Ras-like GTPases, as well as a proline-rich motif, a PDZ-domain (26Ponting C.P. Phillips C. Davies K.E. Blake D.J. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), and a structure that is related to the cAMP-binding domains in Epac and PKA (RCBD). Indeed, Epacs are the closest relatives of PDZ-GEFs. PDZ-GEF1 activates (in vitro as well as in vivo) Rap1 and Rap2, but not Ras, R-ras, or Ral. Like the cAMP binding domain in Epac, the RCBD has a negative effect on the exchange activity of PDZ-GEF1. We conclude that PDZ-GEF1 is a novel Rap1- and Rap2-specific GEF, in which the activity is negatively regulated by an intramolecular domain. The presence of domains in amino acid sequences was analyzed using the ISREC ProfileScan server. Gene sequences in genomic DNA were predicted using programs united in NIX at the Human Genome Mapping Project Resource Center. Alignment of homologous amino acid sequences was conducted using the program ClustalX (27Jeanmougin F. Thompson J.D. Gouy M. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 403-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2385) Google Scholar). HA-PDZ-GEF1 contains the full-length PDZ-GEF1 cDNA cloned in the PMT2-SM-HA eukaryotic expression vector. In the same vector, all small GTPases used in overexpression, as well as the deletion constructs of PDZ-GEF1, were cloned. HA-PDZ-GEF1-B5 contains amino acids 1–1002, and HA-PDZ-GEF1-M5 contains amino acids 252–1002. For purification of GST fusion constructs, PDZ-GEF1-M5 and PDZ-GEF1-B5 were cloned in the pGEX4T3 bacterial expression vector. Protein production was induced in Bl-21 bacteria using 100 nmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 20 h at room temperature. After protein production, bacteria were pelleted and lysed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors. The lysate was sonicated three times for 10 s and centrifuged at 10,000 × g to remove insoluble material. GST fusion proteins were purified from the cleared lysate by batchwise incubation with glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma), eluted from the beads in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 10 mmglutathione, and dialyzed for 20 h in the same buffer without glutathione. Small GTPases used for in vitro experiments were as described elsewhere (7Herrmann C. Horn G. Spaargaren M. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6794-6800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 28Lenzen C. Cool R.H. Prinz H. Kuhlmann J. Wittinghofer A.

Chem. 1999; 274: 17763-17770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A human multiple tissue Northern blot was purchased from CLONTECH. Western blotting of total lysates and protein samples isolated by activation-specific probe assays were on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The antiserum used for detecting endogenous PDZ-GEF1 in total cell lysates was raised against a synthetic peptide containing amino acids 1480–1498 (PYQSQGFSTEEDEDEQVSA) from PDZ-GEF1. Cells were transfected with HA-tagged versions of the small GTPases and serum-starved for 20 h prior to all activation experiments. GTP-bound forms of the different GTPases were isolated using activation-specific probes as described (2Franke B. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 30Wolthuis R.M. Franke B. van Triest M. Bauer B. Cool R.H. Camonis J.H. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2486-2491Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 31de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). R-ras was studied using the Ras-binding domain (RBD) of Raf1. Detection during Western blotting was performed by 12CA5 monoclonal antibodies directed against the HA-tag. In vivo labeling experiments for Rap1 and Rap2 were performed as described (32de Vries-Smits A.M. van der Voorn L. Downward J. Bos J.L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 156-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Briefly, serum-starved cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate for 5 h. Rap2 was precipitated using 12CA5 antibodies and nucleotides were eluted and separated on PEI-cellulose F thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates (Merck). Labeled nucleotides were visualized using a PhosphorImager, and GTP/GDP ratios were calculated using the program ImageQuant (33Wolthuis R.M. de Ruiter N.D. Cool R.H. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6748-6761Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed as described (34van den Berghe N. Cool R.H. Horn G. Wittinghofer A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 845-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 nm of purified GTPase loaded with fluorescently labeled 2′,3′-bis(O)-N-methylantharanoloyl-guanosinediphosphate (mant-GDP) was incubated in the presence of excess unlabeled GDP with 50 nm of purified PDZ-GEF1. Release of mant-GDP was measured in real time as a decrease in fluorescence. To calculate reaction rates, single exponential functions were fit using the program Grafit 3.0 (Eritacus). In a data base screen for possible regulators of Rap proteins, a new family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors, which we named PDZ-GEFs, was found. The cDNA encoding the PDZ-GEF1 protein was isolated earlier in a random cloning strategy and was designated KIAA0313 (35Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Nakajima D. Ohira M. Seki N. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1997; 4: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The PDZ-GEF1 gene is conserved in nematode (Z68880 and CAA93100) and fly (AC005285), as judged from gene predictions on genomic sequences of these organisms, and has a human homologue (PDZ-GEF2), as predicted from genomic sequences in chromosome 5 (AC004622 and AC004227). The PDZ-GEFs form a new family of exchange factors that is most closely related to Epacs, which are Rap1-specific GEFs directly regulated by cAMP (Fig. 1 a). PDZ-GEFs contain a number of conserved domains (Fig. 1 b). First, they have a Ras exchange motif that is present in all CDC25-like exchange factors and is probably needed for protein stabilization (36Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Margarit S.M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1998; 394: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Second, they have a catalytic domain that shows considerable homology to previously described Rap1 and Ras GEFs especially in the strongly conserved regions 1, 2, and 3 (Fig. 1 c). Third, they have a domain exhibiting the characteristics of a PDZ domain (hence the name PDZ-GEF) (Fig. 1 d). This last domain has a hydrophobic amino acid located at position 1 in the second predicted α-helix (Leucine 446, indicated by an arrow in Fig. 1 d) and may therefore be a class II PDZ domain (37Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar). Finally, a conserved structure is present in PDZ-GEFs that is related to the cAMP-binding domains in Epac and PKA. However, the RCBD does not contain conserved residues at the positions that interact with cAMP in PKA (38Gorman K.B. Steinberg R.A. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1994; 20: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 39McKnight G.S. Clegg C.H. Uhler M.D. Chrivia J.C. Cadd G.G. Correll L.A. Otten A.D. Recent Prog. Horm.

Science. 1995; 269: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), as indicated byarrows in Fig. 1 e. This implies that cAMP is probably not the interacting molecule. To investigate whether the PDZ-GEF1 gene is transcribed in human cells we probed a commercial human multiple tissue Northern blot with a radioactively labeled probe spanning the GEF domain of PDZ-GEF1 and found that the gene is expressed in all tissues present on the membrane (Fig. 2 a). Furthermore, we raised a polyclonal antibody to a C-terminal peptide of PDZ-GEF1 (in rabbits) that recognized a 200-kDa protein in cell lysates of a number of different cell lines (Fig. 2 b). As a control two identical Western blots containing several of these lysates were probed with the antiserum or with antiserum that was preincubated with the peptide used for immunizing the rabbits. In this case the 200-kDa band disappeared (Fig. 2 c). From this we conclude that the PDZ-GEF1 gene is ubiquitously expressed and that the cDNA is indeed translated into a protein of the predicted molecular weight. To investigate the specificity of PDZ-GEF1 for the members of the Ras family of small GTPases we transfected these small GTPases either alone or in combination with PDZ-GEF1 in COS-7 cells (Fig. 3 a) and used the appropriate GST-RBD constructs as activation-specific probes to measure activation of the small GTPases (2Franke B. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 30Wolthuis R.M. Franke B. van Triest M. Bauer B. Cool R.H. Camonis J.H. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell.

As shown in Fig. 3 b, cotransfection with PDZ-GEF1 results in a massive increase in the GTP-bound forms of Rap1 (both Rap1A and Rap1B), whereas the amount of GTP-bound Ras, Ral, Rap2, or R-ras was not affected. From these results we concluded that overexpression of PDZ-GEF1 leads to specific activation of Rap1. To prove that the activation of Rap1 by PDZ-GEF1 results from a direct interaction, we measured Rap1 activation in vitro. Because full-length PDZ-GEF1 could not be purified, we constructed GST fusions of truncated versions of PDZ-GEF1 (Fig. 3 a). GST-PDZ-GEF1-B5 contains amino acids 1–1002, thus lacking the 497-amino acid C-terminal region with no recognizable domains. GST-PDZ-GEF1-M5 contains amino acids 252–1002, thus lacking both the 497-amino acid C-terminal region and the RCBD. Both constructs were expressed inEscherichia coli and purified by glutathione-agarose beads (Fig. 3 a, right panel). Purified Rap1 loaded with fluorescent mant-GDP (34van den Berghe N. Cool R.H. Horn G. Wittinghofer A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 845-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) was incubated with the different GST-PDZ-GEF1 proteins in the presence of excess unlabeled GDP, and exchange of guanine nucleotide bound to Rap1 was measured in real time as a decrease in fluorescence (Fig. 3 c). Exchange of the nucleotide bound to Rap1 was slightly stimulated by GST-PDZ-GEF1-B5 but was stimulated more dramatically by an equal amount of GST-PDZ-GEF1-M5, which lacks the RCBD. First of all, these results confirm the in vivo data that proves that PDZ-GEF1 can function as a Rap1-GEF. In addition, these results indicate that the RCBD is an inhibitory domain in PDZ-GEF. This latter conclusion was supported by experiments in which increasing amounts of HA-tagged versions of PDZ-GEF1-B5 and PDZ-GEF1-M5 (Fig. 3 a) were expressed together with Rap1 in COS-7 cells. At low levels of expression, PDZ-GEF1-M5 induced a much stronger activation of Rap1 than PDZ-GEF1-B5 (Fig. 3 d). In this respect RCBD acts in a way that is similar to the cAMP domain of Epac (24de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J. Verheijen M.H. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1621) Google Scholar). To investigate whether cAMP or a related molecule could, analogous to Epac, relieve PDZ-GEF1-B5 from the inhibitory effect of the RCBD, we measured PDZ-GEF1-B5 activity in the presence of cAMP. However, as expected from the sequence of RCBD, cAMP did not induce the activation of PDZ-GEF1-B5 in vitro or in cotransfection in COS-7 cells and in A14 fibroblasts (data not shown). Also, cGMP had no effect on PDZ-GEF1-B5 in vivo or in vitro. Recently, the NAD derivatives cADPr and B-NAADP were shown to act as second messengers in T-cell signaling (44Cancela J.M. Churchill G.C. Galione A. Nature. 1999; 398: 74-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 45Guse A.H. da Silva C.P. Berg I. Skapenko A.L. Weber K. Heyer P. Hohenegger M. Ashamu G.A. Schulze-Koops H. Potter B.V. Mayr G.W. Nature. 1999; 398: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Also, these molecules did not modulate the activity of PDZ-GEF1-B5 in vitro (data not shown). To confirm the specificity of PDZ-GEF1 for Rap1, the GST fusion constructs were incubated in the same assay with mant-GDP-loaded Ras, Ral, R-ras, and Rap2. As expected from the cotransfection experiments, no stimulation by PDZ-GEF1 of the guanine nucleotide exchange on Ras, Ral, or R-ras was observed (data not shown). However, Rap2 was slightly activated by GST-PDZ-GEF1-B5 and more strongly by GST-PDZ-GEF1-M5 in this in vitro setup (Fig. 4 a). To compare the activity of PDZ-GEF1 toward Rap1 versus Rap2, the reaction rates of the catalyzed exchange reaction were calculated (see “Experimental Procedures”), compared with the non-catalyzed (intrinsic) exchange rates, and scored as -fold stimulations of guanine nucleotide exchange (Fig. 4, b and c). We observed that PDZ-GEF1 can activate Rap2A more efficiently than Rap1A. Deletion of the RCBD results in a 10-fold higher stimulation of exchange activity on both Rap1 and Rap2. From these experiments we concluded that PDZ-GEF1 is a dual specific GEF that can catalyze the activation of both Rap1 and Rap2. Although guanine nucleotide exchange on Rap2 is strongly stimulated by PDZ-GEF1in vitro, no clear increase in GTP-bound Rap2 was found when coexpressed with PDZ-GEF1 in COS-7 cells (Fig. 3 b). This discrepancy caused us to question the validity of the use of Ral GDS-RBD as an activation-specific probe for Rap2. Therefore, we performed a classic GTP/GDP loading experiment with [32P]orthophosphate-labeled cells. HA-tagged Rap2a was coexpressed with the different PDZ-GEF1 constructs (Fig. 3 a) in A14 or COS-7 cells. Cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate, Rap2 was immunoprecipitated, and the GTP/GDP content was analyzed by TLC as described (32de Vries-Smits A.M. van der Voorn L. Downward J. Bos J.L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 156-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5 a, over 60% of Rap2 was bound to GTP in resting A14 and COS-7 cells. Rap2-GTP levels were increased to 95, 94, and 85% by PDZ-GEF1-M5, PDZ-GEF1-B5, and full-length PDZ-GEF1, respectively. The high doses of PDZ-GEF1 DNA used in these experiments explains why no difference is observed in the PDZ-GEF1-M5 and PDZ-GEF1-B5 cotransfections. Differences are only observed at low levels of expression, as shown in Fig. 3 d. To test whether the high basal Rap2 activity is due to abnormal signaling activity in the cells used, Rap1 activation was measured in COS-7 cells using the same method. As shown in Fig. 3 b, only 6% of Rap1 was bound to GTP in resting COS-7, and Rap1 GTP levels were increased to 44, 46, and 35% by PDZ-GEF1-M5, PDZ-GEF1-B5, and full-length PDZ-GEF1, respectively. From these experiments we conclude that Rap2 can be activated by PDZ-GEF1 both in vitro andin vivo. The high basal level of Rap2-GTP in resting fibroblasts and COS-7 cells allows a maximal activation of less than 2-fold. This explains why no clear activation of Rap2 was found in the initial experiments using the activation-specific probe approach. However, using the PDZ-GEF1-M5 and PDZ-GEF1-B5 constructs in cotransfection of COS-7 cells, a small increase in Rap2-GTP was observed using Ral GDS-RBD as an activation-specific probe (Fig. 5 c). Here we describe the identification of a novel family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors named PDZ-GEFs. The human PDZ-GEF1 gene encodes a 200-kDa protein that is expressed ubiquitously. PDZ-GEF1 is a dual specific GEF that activates both Rap1 and Rap2 but not Ras, Ral, or R-ras. Apart from the catalytic domain that mediates activation of the small GTPases and the Ras exchange motif that is needed for stability of the protein (36Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Margarit S.M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1998; 394: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar), PDZ-GEFs contain two conserved structures: a domain similar to PDZ-domains and a domain related to cAMP binding sites. PDZ-domains are found in a large variety of signaling proteins, where they mediate protein-protein interactions via the binding of specific C-terminal peptides (26Ponting C.P. Phillips C. Davies K.E. Blake D.J. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 37Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C.

The primary sequence of the RCBD resembles the cAMP-binding domains of Epac, PKA, and the cyclic nucleotide-gated channels, although clear differences exist at the positions that interact with cAMP in PKA (38Gorman K.B. Steinberg R.A. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1994; 20: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 39McKnight G.S. Clegg C.H. Uhler M.D. Chrivia J.C. Cadd G.G. Correll L.A. Otten A.D. Recent Prog.

When cAMP binds to the domain or when it is deleted, this inhibitory effect is abolished. Similarly, RCBD functions as an inhibitory domain, and deletion of the domain results in a much more active protein. As expected, we could not detect any interaction of cAMP or cGMP with the RCBD in vitro (data not shown). Also, two other small second messengers, the NAD derivatives, cyclic ADP-ribose and B-NAADP (44Cancela J.M. Churchill G.C. Galione A. Nature. 1999; 398: 74-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 45Guse A.H. da Silva C.P. Berg I. Skapenko A.L. Weber K. Heyer P. Hohenegger M. Ashamu G.A. Schulze-Koops H. Potter B.V. Mayr G.W. Nature. 1999; 398: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), did not affect the activity of PDZ-GEF. We also failed thus far to find an extracellular stimulus that can augment the activity of PDZ-GEF. We predict that PDZ-GEF is regulated by a ligand, either a small second messenger or a protein or lipid, that binds to the RCBD. In this model the PDZ domain may serve as a membrane anchor to get the GEF close to Rap1. A similar function is predicted for the DEP domain in Epac (24de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J. Verheijen M.H. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1621) Google Scholar). PDZ-GEF1 differs from C3G and CalDAG-GEFI in that it activates Rap2 as well (Ref. 48van den Berghe N. Cool R.H. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11078-11085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar and data not shown). It is currently unclear what determines this difference in specificity. Comparing the sequences of the catalytic domains of these GEFs, an insert appears to be present in PDZ-GEF1. As judged from the structure of the complex between Ras and Sos, however, this loop would not be at the interface between GEF and GTPase. Hybrid analysis or mutational analysis may determine which sequences in the GEFs are responsible for the differences. PDZ-GEF1 is the first reported GEF for Rap2. Unfortunately, we have not found an external stimulus that is able to induce the activation of PDZ-GEF and, as a consequence, the activation of Rap2. Also, for the activation of Rap2 in general, no stimuli have yet been reported. This raises the question whether Rap2 might not be regulated at all by external stimuli. Indeed, the basal level of Rap2, at least in fibroblasts and COS-7 cells, is very high. This may be because of the presence of a constitutively active GEF or the absence of a Rap2-specific GTPase activating protein. In this model, regulation of Rap2 signaling could be achieved by modulation of Rap2-binding proteins, thereby influencing the availability of Rap2 for its effectors or the availability of the effectors for Rap2. Alternatively, the high basal level of GTP-bound Rap2 may represent the resting state in a living cell, which can be activated by stimuli, that we haven't yet found because our assay is not sensitive enough to detect an increase from 60–80% GTP. In conclusion, the identification of the family of PDZ-GEFs reveals the presence of a fourth type of Rap1 GEF in addition to Epacs, CalDAG-GEFI, and C3G. Furthermore, PDZ-GEF1 represents another example of an emerging theme that GEFs are regulated by a domain that intramolecularly constrains the activity of the GEF. Such domains exists in Epac (24de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J. Verheijen M.H. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1621) Google Scholar) as well as in Sos (49Corbalan-Garcia S. Margarit S.M. Galron D. Yang S.S. Bar-Sagi D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 880-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and it is predicted that the calcium binding domains of the GRPs serve a similar function. Finally, PDZ-GEF1 is the first exchange factor that can activate Rap2. We thank Dr. Fried Zwartkruis for discussions and critical reading of the manuscript. In addition, we thank Jean de Gunzburg for Rap2 cDNA and the Kazusa DNA Research Institute for KIAA0313 cDNA."
https://openalex.org/W1983020293,"The Abd-B Hox gene contains an extended 3′ cis-regulatory region that is subdivided into a series of separate iab domains. The iab-7 domain activates Abd-B in parasegment 12 (ps12), whereas iab-8 controls expression in ps13. iab-7 is flanked by two insulators, Fab-7 and Fab-8, which are thought to prevent regulatory factors, such as Polycomb silencers, from influencing neighboring iab domains. This organization poses a potential paradox, since insulator DNAs can work in a dominant fashion to block enhancer–promoter interactions over long distances. Here, we present evidence for a novel cis-regulatory sequence located within iab-7, the promoter targeting sequence (PTS), which permits distal enhancers to overcome the blocking effects of Fab-8 and the heterologous su(Hw) insulator. We propose that the PTS converts dominant, long-range insulators into local regulatory elements that separate neighboring iab domains."
https://openalex.org/W2001054940,"The crystal structure of very short patch repair (Vsr) endonuclease, in complex with Mg2+ and with duplex DNA containing a TG mismatch, has been determined at 2.3 A resolution. In E. coli, the enzyme recognizes a TG mismatched base pair, generated after spontaneous deamination of methylated cytosines, and cleaves the phosphate backbone on the 5' side of the thymine. Extensive interactions between the DNA and the protein characterize a novel recognition mechanism, where three aromatic residues intercalate from the major groove into the DNA to strikingly deform the base pair stacking. With the presence of a cleaved DNA intermediate in the active center, the structure of the Vsr/DNA complex provides detailed insights into the catalytic mechanism for endonuclease activity."

Because the function of the protein was unclear in the previous report, we investigated the role it plays in cells.

In vitro studies showed that both 1-acyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (lyso-PC) and 1-O-alkyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (lyso-platelet activating factor (lyso-PAF)) are good substrates of the protein. In further radiolabeling experiments, 1-acyl-lyso-PC was predominantly and equally metabolized into diacyl-PC in both vector and overexpressing cells.

Among these, A- and N-SMases have been suggested to play important roles in apoptosis. A-SMase was purified from human urine, and its cDNA was cloned (11Quintern L.E. Weitz G. Nehrkorn H. Tager J.M.

However, another recent report showed that cells from a patient of Niemann-Pick disease, in which A-SMase is deficient, underwent apoptosis in a similar way to normal cells in response to Fas (22Cock J.G.

Chem. 1998; 273: 7560-7565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), suggesting that A-SMase is not involved in Fas-induced ceramide generation. Advanced purification of N-SMase from rat brain was recently reported (14Liu B. Hassler D.F. Smith G.K. Weaver K. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34472-34479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), but mammalian N-SMase has not been purified to homogeneity yet. However, cloning of a putative mouse and human N-SMase was recently reported by searching for sequences similar to those of bacterial N-SMase (23Tomiuk S. Hofmann K. Nix M. Zumbansen M. Stoffel W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3638-3643Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Although N-SMase activity was greatly increased in cells overexpressing the cloned cDNA, it was not clear in the report whether the overexpressed protein itself has the N-SMase activity and whether SM is a physiological substrate or not. Here we demonstrate that the putative N-SMase protein immunoprecipitated with anti-hexa-histidine antibody has N-SMase activity in vitro. Although N-SMase activity was much increased in vitro, the metabolism of SM and ceramide was not apparently affected in cells overexpressing this activity. Furthermore we show that both 1-acyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (lyso-PC) and 1-O-alkyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (i.e. lyso-platelet activating factor (lyso-PAF)) are good substrates for the overexpressed protein in vitro. An accumulation of 1-O-alkyl-sn-glycerol (1-alkyl-glycerol) with corresponding decrease of 1-alkyl-2-acyl-PC were detected in overexpressing cells. Furthermore, radiolabeling experiments showed that although 1-acyl-lyso-PC was predominantly converted to diradyl-PC, lyso-PAF was almost equally metabolized into both diradyl-PC and 1-alkyl-glycerol in overexpressing cells. These results suggest that the putative N-SMase protein acts as lyso-PAF-phospholipase C (PLC) in cells. The significance of lyso-PAF-PLC in the metabolism of PAF and other lipids including both glycerolipids and sphingolipids is discussed. [Choline-methyl-14C]SM and [acetyl-14C]C2-ceramide were provided by Dr. Alicja Bielawska (Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC).

Frozen stripped rat brains were purchased from Pel-Freez Biologicals. Other chemicals were from Sigma. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells and human leukemia Molt-4 cells were purchased from ATCC. The cells were cultured in minimum essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2incubator. Exponentially growing cells were used in experiments because an accumulation of monoalkylglycerol has previously been reported in confluent cells (24Warne T.R. Buchanan F.G. Robinson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11147-11154Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Two oligo-DNA primers (ATGAAGCTCAACTTCTCCCTGCGACTG and TTATTGTTCTTTAGTTCTGTCCCCCTCCTGCTG) were synthesized corresponding to the amino-terminal sense and carboxyl-terminal antisense sequences of the open reading frame from the reported putative human N-SMase cDNA (GenBankTM accession number AJ 222801), respectively. PCR was performed with these two primers using a human cDNA library generated from neuroblastoma cells as a template. A PCR product of expected molecular size (approximately 1.3 kilobase pairs) was obtained and subcloned into pT7Blue-3 (Novagen). The sequence of the PCR product was analyzed by ABI 377 DNA sequencer, and it demonstrated a 100% homology to the reported sequence of the putative human N-SMase. The insert was cut out between BamHI and XhoI sites and ligated into the same sites in pcDNA3.1/HisC and pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen), and the construct was named pHisNSM and p3.1NSM, respectively. Plasmids were transfected into HEK293 cells by calcium phosphate methods as described (25Feng X. Zhang J. Barak L.S. Meyer T. Caron M.G. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol.

For the selection of stable transfectants, 100 μg/ml of G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) were added to the medium. Independent colonies were picked up and cultured in separate wells, and the cells from one colony expressing the highest N-SMase activity in in vitro N-SMase assays were used as pHisNSM transfectant cells. Cells were lysed in buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 25 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml each of chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin A, and centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min, and supernatant was used for the assay. 5–10 μl of cell lysate was added to 100 μl of reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 5 mmMgCl2, 0.05% Triton X-100, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 10 nmol [choline-methyl-14C]SM (100000 cpm), and 10 nmol phosphatidylserine. After 30 or 60 min of incubation at 37 °C 1.5 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1) was added, the phases were separated by addition of 200 μl of water, and 400 μl of the upper phase was mixed with 4 ml of Safety Solve (Research Products International) for liquid scintillation counting. The assay was performed as described in N-SMase assay except that reaction mixture contained 100 mmsodium acetate (pH 5.0), 0.1% Triton X-100, and 10 nmol [choline-methyl-14C]SM (100,000 cpm). The assay was performed as described in N-SMase assay except that reaction mixture contained no phosphatidylserine and 10 nmol [choline-methyl-14C]PC (100,000 cpm) instead of SM. Cell lysate was prepared as described in N-SMase assay. 5 μl of cell lysate were added to 100 μl of reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 nmol [1-O-octadecyl-3H]lyso-PAF (200,000 dpm). After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, the lipid was extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (26Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42878) Google Scholar) and separated by TLC in solvent system A (chlorform/methanol/15 mm CaCl2 60:35:8) or B (chloroform/methanol/2N NH4OH 60:35:5). The TLC plates were sprayed with EN3HANCE (NEN Life Science Products) and exposed to films at −80 °C for 2 days. The band corresponding to monoalkylglycerol was scraped from the TLC plate for liquid scintillation counting. The assay was performed as described in lyso-PAF-PLC assay except that reaction mixture contained 10 nmol [1-palmitoyl-14C]lyso-PC (100,000 cpm) instead of lyso-PAF and the band corresponding to monoacylglycerol was scraped from the TLC plate for liquid scintillation counting. The assay was performed as described in lyso-PAF-PLC assay except that the reaction mixture contained 10 nmol [1-O-octadecyl-3H]PAF (200,000 dpm) instead of lyso-PAF. Cells were suspended in the buffer containing 25 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml each of chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin A, lysed by repeated sheering using 26 G needle, and centrifuged at 800 × gfor 5 min, and the supernatant was used for the assay as described (27Luberto C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14550-14559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, 10 μl of cell lysate was added to 100 μl of reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 25 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 10 nmol [acetyl-14C]C2-ceramide (200,000 cpm). After 30 or 60 min of incubation at 37 °C, 1.5 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1) was added. The phases were separated by the addition of 0.2 ml of water, and the lipids in the lower phase were separated by TLC in solvent system A. The band corresponding to C2-SM was scraped from the TLC plate and transferred into 4 ml of Safety Solve for liquid scintillation counting. Cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml each of chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain and pepstatin A), and centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 15 min. 5 μl of anti-His6 monoclonal antibody (CLONTECH) was added to the supernatant and rocked at 4 °C for 3 h. Then 30 μl of protein G-agarose (Life Technologies, Inc.) was added, and after 2 h of incubation, the beads were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 1 min, washed twice with 1 ml of lysis buffer, and suspended in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer without protease inhibitors. For control experiments, mouse normal IgG (Santa-Cruz) was used instead of anti-His6antibody. Cells were lysed as described in SM synthase assay. Rat brains were homogenized in the same buffer by using a Teflon pestle glass homogenizer. Lysate was centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min, and then the supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet was used as the membrane fraction. N-SMase was partially purified from the membrane fraction of rat brain or Molt-4 cells as described (28Liu B. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16281-16287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) except that HiTrap Q column (1 ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used instead of DEAE-Sepharose column. Western blot was performed as described (29Sawai H. Okazaki T. Takeda Y. Tashima M. Sawada H. Okuma M. Kishi S. Umehara H. Domae N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2452-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) except that 10% running gel and nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) were used. Anti-His6 monoclonal antibody (CLONTECH), rabbit polyclonal antibody against the cloned human N-SMase (MEMOREC Stoffel GmbH, Germany), goat anti-mouse antibody, and anti-rabbit antibody (Santa-Cruz) were used at 1:2000 dilution. Cellular Lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer. For the measurement of SM, the lipids in chloroform were mixed with the same volume of 0.2n NaOH in methanol and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The phase was separated by the addition of 0.45 volume of 0.2n HCl. Lipids were separated by TLC in solvent system A and visualized with iodine vapor, and the bands corresponding to SM and PC were scraped. Lipids were extracted from the silica gel by the method of Bligh and Dyer, and the level of lipid phosphate was determined as described before (30Ames B.N. Dubin D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 769-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The level of ceramide was determined by using diacylglycerol kinase assay as described (29Sawai H. Okazaki T. Takeda Y. Tashima M. Sawada H. Okuma M. Kishi S. Umehara H. Domae N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2452-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). [9,10-3H]Hexadecanol was made by a modification of the procedure described (31Davis P.A. Hajra A.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 211: 20-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, the methyl ester of [9,10-3H]hexadecanoic acid was reduced by treatment with Vitride [sodium bis(2-methoxyethoxy)aluminum hydride] (Red-AlTM, Aldrich). Following reduction, the excess vitride was destroyed by addition of ice-cold 20% ethanol, and the radioactive alcohol was extracted with chloroform. The radioactive alcohol was localized by autoradiography following a preparative TLC in a silica gel-G plate (Analtech) (hexane:diethyl ether:acetic acid 70:30:1). The corresponding spot was eluted from the TLC plate by extraction of the silica gel scrapings with chloroform:methanol (2:1). The yield (99%) and purity (>98%) of the product was assessed by TLC in the same solvent system described above. The specific activity of the product was 0.2–0.3 Ci/mmol. For [3H]choline labeling, cells plated in 100-mm culture dishes in 8 ml of medium were labeled with 2 μCi of [3H]choline. For chase experiments, cells were labeled for 4 days, and then medium was replaced by new medium, and the cells were further incubated for the indicated hours. Lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer. For the experiments with bacterial SMase treatment, the medium was replaced by new medium, the cells were rested for 2 h, 100 milliunits/ml of bacterial SMase fromStaphylococcus aureus (Sigma) was added to the medium, and after 25 min of incubation the medium was replaced by new medium, and the cells were further incubated for the indicated times. Cells were lysed in 0.6 ml of water, and a portion was used for determination of protein concentration as described (27Luberto C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14550-14559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). For labeling with [3H]palmitic acid or [3H]hexadecanol, cells were incubated with 5 μCi of [3H]palmitic acid or 2 μCi of [3H]hexadecanol for the indicated times. For labeling with [1-O-octadecyl-3H]lyso-PAF, [1-palmitoyl-14C]lyso-PC, or [1-O-octadecyl-3H]PAF, medium was replaced by serum-free medium, and then cells were incubated with either 1 μCi of [3H]lyso-PAF, [14C]lyso-PC, or [3H]PAF for the indicated times. Lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer and separated by TLC in solvent system A or B or C (chloroform:methanol:acetic acid 98:2:1). Two primers corresponding to the amino- and carboxyl-terminal of the open reading frame were synthesized from the cDNA sequence of the putative human N-SMase, and PCR was performed using a human cDNA library generated from neuroblastoma cells as a template. The PCR product of the expected size (approximately 1.3 kilobase pairs) was subcloned into pT7Blue-3, and it was confirmed that its sequence was identical to that previously reported. The insert was cut out and ligated in BamHI-XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1/HisC for hexa-histidine-tagged expression of the protein (pHisNSM). When the pHisNSM was stably transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 cells, N-SMase activity in the cell lysate was increased by approximately 20-fold compared with vector transfectant cells (Table I). The N-SMase activity was Mg2+-dependent and stimulated by reducing reagents such as dithiothreitol and β-mercaptoethanol when lysis buffer did not contain reducing reagents (data not shown). However, PC-PLC activity was not increased in pHisNSM transfectant cells (Table I) in contrast to the previous report, which described an increase of PC-PLC activity equivalent to about 30% of N-SMase activity. Also, SM synthase activity was not increased in pHisNSM transfectant cells (Table I). A-SMase activity was decreased in pHisNSM transfectant cells compared with wild type or vector transfectant cells (Table I).Table IEnzymatic activity in lysates of wild type, vector transfectant, and pHisNSM transfectant cellsWild typeVectorpHisNSMN-SMase6.8 ± 1.08.1 ± 1.0126.8 ± 17.4PC-PLC1.0 ± 0.20.7 ± 0.20.5 ± 0.1SM synthase1.1 ± 0.11.0 ± 0.11.1 ± 0.1A-SMase49.2 ± 1.053.4 ± 4.534.0 ± 6.5 Open table in a new tab Because the overexpressed protein was not purified in the previous report, it was not clear whether the overexpressed protein itself has N-SMase activity or not. Therefore, the overexpressed protein was immunoprecipitated by anti-His6 antibody (Fig. 1 A), and N-SMase activity of the immunoprecipitant was measured. As shown in Fig. 1 B, approximately 40% of the activity were recovered in the immunoprecipitant, and only 20% remained in the supernatant. However, the same amount of mouse IgG did not immunoprecipitate either the overexpressed protein (Fig. 1 A) or N-SMase activity (Fig. 1 B). We also purified the overexpressed protein with hexa-histidine tag by using TALONspin metal affinity column (CLONTECH). The molecular mass of the purified protein was about 48 kDa, consistent with the expected molecular size of the hexa-histidine-tagged protein. The 48-kDa protein was also detected by Western blot using anti-His6 antibody. However, the purified protein had little N-SMase activity, possibly because of the inhibition by Co2+ used for the affinity column (data not shown). In earlier experiments we found that a high concentration (1%) of Triton X-100 in the lysis buffer inhibited N-SMase activity of the overexpressed protein, whereas activity was rather stable in the presence of 0.1% Triton X-100 in the lysis buffer. Because it was previously reported that 1% Triton X-100 in the extraction buffer did not inhibit N-SMase activity in rat brain membrane fraction (14Liu B. Hassler D.F. Smith G.K. Weaver K. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34472-34479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), the effect of Triton X-100 in the extraction buffer was examined on N-SMase activity in the membrane fraction of p3.1NSM transfectant cells. The final concentration of Triton X-100 in the N-SMase assay was adjusted to 0.1% in these experiments. As shown in Fig. 2, 1% Triton X-100 in the extraction buffer inhibited N-SMase activity of the transfectant cells by approximately 80%. However, rat brain N-SMase activity was not inhibited by 1% Triton X-100 in the extraction buffer (Fig. 2) as previously reported. The effects of other detergents on N-SMase activity were also examined. As shown in Fig. 2, both 1% Nonidet P-40 and 1.5% β-octylglucoside in the extraction buffer inhibited N-SMase activity of transfectant cells by approximately 90%, whereas 10 mm deoxycholic acid inhibited N-SMase activity of rat brain much more than that of transfectant cells. These results suggested that the overexpressed N-SMase is distinguishable from rat brain N-SMase. In this experiment, p3.1NSM, which does not contain the hexa-histidine tag, was used for the overexpression of the cloned protein in the native form. A band of approximately 45 kDa was detected in p3.1NSM transfectant cells by Western blot using an antibody against the cloned human N-SMase protein (Fig. 3). However, the antibody detected little, if any, 45-kDa protein in a partially purified N-SMase preparation from Molt-4 cells. In these experiments, equal N-SMase activities were loaded. These results suggest that the cloned N-SMase is immunologically distinct from the endogenous N-SMase in Molt-4 cells. Because of the above results showing N-SMase activity distinct from purified N-SMases, we next investigated the function of the cloned N-SMase in cells. To this end, 293 cells were transfected with either vector alone or pHisNSM expressing the putative N-SMase. There was no apparent phenotypic difference between vector and pHisNSM transfectant cells. As shown in Fig. 4, growth rates of both vector and pHisNSM transfectant cells were similar. To examine whether the overexpressed protein functions as N-SMase in cells, the levels of SM and ceramide in wild type, vector, or pHisNSM transfectants of 293 cells were measured. The level of SM and PC were slightly higher in vector transfectant, and the level of SM was slightly lower in pHisNSM transfectant cells compared with wild type cells (Fig. 5, A andB). The level of ceramide was increased in pHisNSM transfectant cells by approximately 20% compared with vector transfectant cells and by only 10% compared with wild type cells (Fig. 5 C). These changes in the levels of SM and ceramide in overexpressing cells seemed very small compared with the 20-fold increase in in vitro N-SMase activity. When vector or pHisNSM transfectant cells were continuously labeled with [3H]choline, the time course of the increase in labeled PC or SM was similar in both transfectant cells (Fig. 6 A). There was a slight decrease in the level of labeled SM at 3 days in pHisNSM transfectant cells compared with that in vector transfectant cells. When vector or pHisNSM transfectant cells were labeled with [3H]choline in equilibrium and then chased after replacement of medium, labeled SM and PC in pHisNSM transfectant cells decreased in a similar time course with those in vector transfectant cells (Fig. 6 B). These results argue against any significant effect of the enzyme on the catabolism of either SM or PC. In another set of experiments, we employed bacterial SMase to evaluate the topology of SM and its resynthesis. [3H]choline-labeled cells were treated with exogenous bacterial SMase for 25 min and then chased (Fig. 6 C). Treatment with bacterial SMase diminished the level of SM by approximately 80% in both vector and pHisNSM transfectant cells. These results show that the distribution of SM between bacterial SMase-sensitive (outer leaflet) and resistant (internal) pools in pHisNSM transfectant cells is similar to that in vector transfectant cells. Moreover, the level of SM did not recover at least during 24 h in both transfectants, showing that the gene under investigation did not stimulate this pool of SM synthesis. This is consistent with the result of in vitro SM synthase assay, which showed no increase of SM synthase activity (Table I), and with the result of the pulse choline labeling experiment, which showed no stimulation of SM synthesis in pHisNSM transfectant cells compared with vector transfectant cells (Fig. 6 A). Because it has been reported that N-SMase may be involved in stress-induced ceramide generation, we investigated whether overexpres"

RGS4 also autopalmitoylates at a previously identified cellular palmitoylation site, either Cys2 or Cys12. The C2A/C12A mutation essentially eliminates both autopalmitoylation and cellular [3H]palmitate labeling of Cys95. Membrane-bound RGS4 is palmitoylated both at Cys95 and Cys2/12, but cytosolic RGS4 is not palmitoylated. RGS4 and RGS10 are GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) for the Gi and Gq families of G proteins.

In contrast, when GAP activity was assayed as acceleration of steady-state GTPase in receptor-G protein proteoliposomes, palmitoylation of RGS10 potentiated GAP activity ≥20-fold. Palmitoylation near the N terminus of C95V RGS4 did not alter GAP activity toward soluble Gαz and increased Gz GAP activity about 2-fold in the vesicle-based assay. Dual palmitoylation of wild-type RGS4 remained inhibitory. RGS protein palmitoylation is thus multi-site, complex in its control, and either inhibitory or stimulatory depending on the RGS protein and its sites of palmitoylation.

Palmitoylated proteins include G protein α subunits and monomeric GTP-binding proteins (e.g. p21 ras), G protein-coupled receptors, RGS1 proteins, and protein kinases. Unlike prenylation and myristoylation, palmitoylation is reversible, allowing for its regulation. Protein-bound palmitate turns over continuously in cells (see Ref. 1Dunphy J.T. Linder M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar for review). Knowledge of the mechanism and control of protein palmitoylation remain rudimentary. Depalmitoylation may be the rate-limiting event in palmitate turnover. Duncan and Gilman (2Duncan J.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15830-15837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) recently identified a palmitoyl-protein thioesterase that is probably the enzyme that depalmitoylates Gα subunits and which may also depalmitoylate other proteins. The enzyme that transfers palmitate to proteins has not been clearly identified. Dunphy et al. (3Dunphy J.T. Greentree W.K. Manahan C.L. Linder M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7154-7159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) partially purified an activity from hepatic membranes that accelerates palmitoylation of Gα using Pal-CoA as donor, potentially a protein-palmitoyl transferase. However, Gα subunits can autopalmitoylate in vitro at the physiologically correct Cys residues (4Duncan J.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23594-23600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), and G protein-coupled receptors may also autopalmitoylate (5O'Brien P.J. St. Jules R.S. Reddy T.S.

Eye Res. 1986; 43: 929-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Autopalmitoylation is somewhat slower than palmitoylation in vivo, but the correlation between Cys residues that autopalmitoylate in vitro and those that are naturally palmitoylated suggests that autopalmitoylation is at least involved in the physiological process. The Cys residues that selectively autopalmitoylate may do so because their thiol groups have an unusually low pI, because they are at relatively hydrophobic surfaces and are thus exposed to Pal-CoA, or because these proteins contain ancillary residues that catalyze the reaction. The ability of a specific residue to autopalmitoylate would provide selectivity to the palmitoylation process, and the protein studied by Dunphy et al. (3Dunphy J.T. Greentree W.K. Manahan C.L. Linder M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7154-7159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) might act non-selectively either as a Pal-CoA carrier protein or as a non-selective transferase. The functions of protein palmitoylation is an active area of study. In the case of p21ras and Gα subunits, palmitoylation helps anchor the proteins to the plasma membrane (1Dunphy J.T. Linder M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 7Mumby S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 148-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 8Ross E.M. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 107-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Palmitoylation of Gα subunits also enhances their binding to Gβγ and desensitizes them to the GAP activity of RGS proteins (9Iiri T. Backlund Jr., P.S. Jones T.L.Z. Wedegaertner P.B. Bourne H.R.

Palmitoylation has been reported to enhance the activity of a G protein-coupled receptor kinase (11Stoffer R.H. Inglese J. Macrae A.D. Lefkowitz R.J. Premont R.T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16053-16059Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and mutations of the palmitoylated Cys residue in the C-terminal region of G protein-coupled receptors themselves have resulted in a variety of effects (8Ross E.M. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 107-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In none of these cases is it completely clear whether palmitoylation alters the structure of the palmitoylated protein itself, whether the palmitoyl group forms or blocks part of a protein-protein interface, or whether it only increases binding to hydrophobic surfaces. It has recently been reported that several RGS proteins are also palmitoylated in cells (12De Vries L. Elenko E. Hubler L. Jones T.L.Z. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We report here that RGS4 can autopalmitoylate stoichiometrically in vitro at two sites, one near the N terminus and the other in the conserved RGS box domain. RGS10, which lacks the N-terminal site, also autopalmitoylates at the conserved Cys residue. Autopalmitoylation of both proteins correlates well with their palmitoylation in cells. We report further that dual palmitoylation can either inhibit or potentiate GAP activity depending on the site of palmitoylation, the assay medium and on the identity of the RGS protein. Wild-type and mutant RGS4 and RGS10 were purified from Escherichia coli as described (24Wang J. Ducret A. Tu Y. Kozasa T. Aebersold R. Ross E.M. J. Biol.

Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 254-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). [γ-32P]GTP and [3H]Pal-CoA were synthesized and purified as described (4Duncan J.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

The Cys mutants C2A/C12A/C33A and C2A/C12A RGS4 were prepared by sequential polymerase chain reaction reactions. C33A RGS4 cDNA was first prepared by substituting codon 33 by GCG. The product and the wild-type cDNA were cut withNcoI and BamHI and ligated in-frame into a modified pQE60 (Qiagen) that encodes the sequence MGH6MG before the cloning site (30Popov S. Yu K. Kozasa T. Wilkie T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7216-7220Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In subsequent reactions, codons 2 and 12 were replaced by GCC. The final cDNA products, C2A/C12A and C2A/C12A/C33A RGS4, were cloned into the modified pQE60 vector as described above. The ΔN57 RGS4 deletion mutation was generated by polymerase chain reaction with the primer 5′-GATCCATGGGCAAATGGGCTGAATCGCTGGAA. The product was cut withNcoI and BamHI and cloned into the corresponding sites of the modified pQE60 (30Popov S. Yu K. Kozasa T. Wilkie T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7216-7220Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). C95V RGS4 was generated using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) to change codon 95 to GTT. All wild-type or mutant RGS proteins contained N-terminal His6. The accuracy of all constructions was checked by DNA sequencing. For expression in Sf9 cells, cDNAs were removed from pQE60 withNcoI and BamHI and inserted into pVL1392 modified to include a NcoI site at the 5′ end of the multiple cloning site. Recombinant baculoviruses were produced as described previously (27Parker E.M. Kameyama K. Higashijima T. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 519-527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid that encodes RGS10 box was prepared as described (30Popov S. Yu K. Kozasa T. Wilkie T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7216-7220Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). For labeling with [3H]palmitate and small scale preparation, Sf9 cells (4 × 106) were infected with RGS4 or RGS10 virus for 32 h prior to metabolic labeling. Sodium [3H]palmitate (1 mCi) was suspended in 2 ml of IPL-41 that contained 1% ethanol and 2% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Cells were incubated in this medium for 1 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and suspended in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm NaHepes (pH 8.0), 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Cells were lysed by 5 freeze/thaw cycles, followed 10 passes through a 25-gauge needle. The lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min in a Beckman TL100.3 rotor. The supernatant (cytosolic fraction) was removed, and the pellet (crude membrane) was resuspended in lysis buffer. Both fractions could then be analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For purification of active RGS protein, the pellet was solubilized by resuspension and stirring for 30 min at 4 °C in 100 mmNaCl, 50 mm NaHepes (pH 8.0), 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and the protease inhibitors listed above. After centrifugation for 30 min as described above, the supernatant was diluted 5-fold with 50 mm NaHepes (pH 8.0) and applied to nitrilotriacetic acid-Ni2+-agarose and purified as described for RGS proteins expressed in E. coli (24Wang J. Ducret A. Tu Y. Kozasa T. Aebersold R. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26014-26025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). RGS4 from the cytoplasmic fraction was purified similarly. Autopalmitoylation of RGS proteins was performed as described previously for Gα subunits with slight modification (4Duncan J.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23594-23600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 10Tu Y. Wang J. Ross E.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1132-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Routinely, 5 μM RGS protein was incubated with 100 μM radioactive or non-radioactive Pal-CoA for up to 6 h at 30 °C in 50 mm NaHepes (pH 8.0), 0.005% Lubrol PX, and 100 μM 2-mercaptoethanol. Residual free Pal-CoA was removed by adsorbing the palmitoylated RGS protein to nitrilotriacetic acid-Ni2+-agarose followed by elution as described (24Wang J. Ducret A. Tu Y. Kozasa T. Aebersold R. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26014-26025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). To assess the degree of palmitoylation, the preparation was either precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid and isolated either on a glass fiber filter (10Tu Y. Wang J. Ross E.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1132-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) or by SDS-PAGE before liquid scintillation counting. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue to detect proteins and appropriate slices were solubilized with 30% H2O2 for 16 h at 60 °C. RGS concentrations were determined by Amido Black binding (31Schaffner W. Weissmann C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1953) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. SDS-PAGE was performed as described (10Tu Y. Wang J. Ross E.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1132-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Gradient gels (15–22%) were used for CNBr-cleaved samples. Samples for PAGE were prepared as described (10Tu Y. Wang J. Ross E.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1132-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) to maintain palmitoylation during denaturation. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose as described (10Tu Y. Wang J. Ross E.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1132-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and immunoblots were developed according to instructions in the ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). RGS4 (10 μg/ml, 50–100 pmol) in 70% (v/v) formic acid was mixed with 100 mg/ml CNBr and 1 mg/ml tryptophan and was incubated under argon in the dark at room temperature for 20 h. Products were diluted in water and dried under vacuum. Palmitoylated or non-palmitoylated RGS4 was alkylated by incubation with 15 mm N-ethylmaleimide to block free thiol groups and digested with CNBr. The mixture was resolved with SDS-PAGE, the gels were stained by Copper Stain (Bio-Rad), and appropriate bands were cut and extracted with 17% formic acid, 33% 2-propanol (32Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 247: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The molecular masses of peptides were determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight spectrometry using a matrix of 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid on a Voyager-DE spectrometer (PE Biosystems). GAP activity was assayed in two formats. In the simpler assay, purified Gα is first bound to [γ -32P]GTP, and the rate of hydrolysis of the [γ-32P]GTP-Gα is measured in detergent solution in the presence and absence of the GAP. In this assay, GAP activity is defined as the increase in the first-order hydrolysis rate constant or is approximated as an increase in the initial rate of hydrolysis (26Wang J. Tu Y. Woodson J. Song X. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5732-5740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar,33Wang J. Tu Y. Mukhopadhyay S. Chidiac P. Biddlecome G.H. Ross E.M. Manning D.R. G Proteins: Techniques of Analysis. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1999: 123-151Google Scholar). Such single-turnover GAP assays, using either ∼2 nmGαz-[γ-32P]GTP at 15 °C or ∼10 nm Gαi1-[γ-32P]GTP at 8 °C, were performed as described (10Tu Y. Wang J. Ross E.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1132-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 26Wang J. Tu Y. Woodson J. Song X. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5732-5740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A more sensitive and presumably more physiological assay for GAP activity monitors the enhancement of agonist-stimulated steady-state GTPase activity in proteoliposomes reconstituted with receptor and heterotrimeric G protein. Reconstitution of purified m2AChR with either Gior Gz and was performed as described (24Wang J. Ducret A. Tu Y. Kozasa T. Aebersold R. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26014-26025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). RGS proteins were usually incubated with the vesicles for 1 h at 30 °C prior to assay. Conditions for measuring carbachol-stimulated GTPase activity in this system have been described (24Wang J. Ducret A. Tu Y. Kozasa T. Aebersold R. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26014-26025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). When RGS10 or RGS4 were incubated with [3H]Pal-CoA under the conditions originally described by Duncan and Gilman (4Duncan J.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23594-23600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) for autopalmitoylation of Gα subunits, they incorporated 3H through a bond that was sensitive to both NH2OH and DTT (Fig. 1 A), presumably a palmitoyl thioester. Both RGS4 (13Srinivasa S.P. Bernstein L.S. Blumer K.J. Linder M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5584-5589Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and RGS10 are also naturally palmitoylated in Sf9 cells, as indicated by labeling with [3H]palmitic acid (Fig. 1 B). In vivo [3H]palmitoylation was essentially limited to the RGS protein found in the particulate fraction. Little label was found on soluble RGS protein despite the fact that about 30% of RGS4 and almost all of the RGS10 were found in the cytoplasmic fraction. The extent of in vitro autopalmitoylation of RGS10 was approximately 1 mol of palmitate/mol (Fig. 1 A). A truncated RGS10 consisting only of the conserved RGS box was also labeled to about 1 mol/mol with approximately similar kinetics. Because Cys66 is the only Cys residue in the RGS10 box, its palmitoylation accounts for that observed in full-length RGS10. Intact RGS4 incorporated 2 mol of palmitate/mol, but an N-terminal truncation mutant of RGS4 was labeled to only 1 mol/mol. This finding suggests that one palmitoylation site lies in the RGS4 box and that the other lies in the N-terminal region. Because Cys66 in RGS10 is the only highly conserved Cys residue in the RGS protein family, its palmitoylation suggests that the corresponding Cys residue in RGS4, Cys95, might be the site of palmitoylation in the RGS4 box. Both Cys2 and Cys12 are candidate sites for the N-terminal palmitoylation site (13Srinivasa S.P. Bernstein L.S. Blumer K.J. Linder M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5584-5589Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 14Druey K.M. Ugur O. Caron J.M. Chen C.-K. Backlund P.S. Jones T.L.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18836-18842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and we did not try to distinguish between them in this study. We analyzed the palmitoylation sites of RGS4 by a combination of CNBr peptide mapping and mutagenesis. As shown in Fig. 2 A, autopalmitoylated RGS4 contained [3H]palmitate in two CNBr-generated peptides, one of about 15,000 Da and the other of about 2000 Da. Both peptides were also labeled in RGS4 that had been palmitoylated in Sf9 cells. The palmitoylated peptides were identified both by Edman sequencing and mass spectrometry as Lys20–Met141, which includes most of the RGS4 box, and Cys2–Met19. Comparison of the masses of these peptides in samples prepared from palmitoylated and non-palmitoylated samples indicated that each incorporated 1 palmitoyl group. Mutation of Cys95 decreased palmitoylation of intact RGS4 that was labeled either in vitro or in vivo, and essentially eliminated incorporation of palmitate into the ∼15-kDa Lys20–Met141 peptide (Fig. 2 B). This finding, coupled with the unique palmitoylation of the homologous Cys66 residue in RGS10, indicates that Cys95 is the site of palmitoylation in the RGS4 box. In autopalmitoylated RGS4, Cys95 and the more N-terminal site were each labeled to approximately 1 mol/mol. In Sf9 cells, however, more [3H]palmitate was incorporated into the N-terminal site than into Cys95 under our standard conditions for Sf9 cell growth. This difference might reflect either relatively more incorporation of palmitate into the N-terminal site or more complete turnover at that site, although net incorporation of label into RGS4 was essentially complete within 1 h. To study the interdependence of palmitoylation of the N-terminal region and the RGS box, we mutated Cys2 and Cys12, which are probable sites of cellular palmitoylation in both RGS4 and RGS16 (13Srinivasa S.P. Bernstein L.S. Blumer K.J. Linder M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5584-5589Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 14Druey K.M. Ugur O. Caron J.M. Chen C.-K. Backlund P.S. Jones T.L.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18836-18842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, mutation of these sites eliminated all RGS4 autopalmitoylation, including autopalmitoylation of Cys95 (Fig. 3 B). To determine whether N-terminal palmitoylation precedes Cys95 autopalmitoylation in wild-type RGS4, we monitored autopalmitoylation of both sites in vitro. As shown in Fig. 3 C, autopalmitoylation at Cys95 lagged somewhat behind autopalmitoylation at the N terminus. While the lag was not great, it was reproducible in three similar experiments. These findings indicate that palmitoylation of the N-terminal site is kinetically favored over Cys95 palmitoylation. Consistent with this idea, the ΔN57 mutant of RGS4 and RGS10 (which is not N-terminally palmitoylated) both autopalmitoylate very slowly (t 1/2 ∼ 2 h, compared with at 1/2 of 30 min for wild-type RGS4). These results suggest that initial N-terminal palmitoylation promotes subsequent palmitoylation in the RGS4 box. N-terminal palmitoylation is not absolutely required for autopalmitoylation within the RGS box because both Cys95 in the RGS4 box construct and Cys66 in RGS10 do slowly autopalmitoylate. Coupling of palmitoylation in the RGS box with that in the N-terminal region also appears to hold true in cells, where the C2A/C12A mutation eliminates all RGS4 palmitoylation (13Srinivasa S.P. Bernstein L.S. Blumer K.J. Linder M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5584-5589Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Autopalmitoylation of RGS4 inhibited its GAP activity essentially completely when activity was measured in a single-turnover assay in detergent solution (Fig. 3 A). Upon incubation with Pal-CoA, GAP activity declined with a time course similar to that of incorporation of palmitate (data not shown; see Fig. 4 for similar data for RGS10). Incubation of autopalmitoylated RGS4 with DTT largely reversed inhibition (Fig. 3 A), and incubation of RGS4 without Pal-CoA was without effect. The GAP assays shown in Fig. 3 A used Gαz-GTP as substrate, but similar results were obtained in similar experiments that used Gαi1-GTP as substrate and Triton X-100 instead of Lubrol PX. Mutation of Cys95 in RGS4 blocked inhibition of GAP activity by incubation with Pal-CoA, suggesting that inhibition is mediated by palmitoylation of Cys95 (Fig. 3 B; see also Fig. 7 A). As would be predicted by its inability to incorporate palmitate at Cys95, Both C2A/C12A and C2A/C12A/C33A RGS4 were also not inhibited by incubation with Pal-CoA (Fig. 3 B). Palmitoylation also inhibited the GAP activity of RGS10 when activity was measured in the solution-based assay (Fig. 4). Again, fractional inhibition of GAP activity paralleled fractional palmitoylation and suggested that stoichiometrically palmitoylated RGS10 is inhibited 80–90% at this substrate concentration. Control incubations without Pal-CoA did not cause inhibition (Fig. 4), and inhibition was reversed by incubation with DTT (not shown). Because RGS10 is palmitoylated only on Cys66, these data combine with those of Fig. 3 to indicate that palmitoylation of the conserved Cys residue in the RGS box blocks the GAP activity of these RGS proteins in the single-turnover assay. In contrast to the inhibition described above, palmitoylation of RGS10 markedly stimulated its GAP activity as measured during receptor-stimulated, steady-state GTP hydrolysis. The agonist-stimulated GTPase activity of unilamellar phospholipid vesicles that contained heterotrimeric Gi and m2AChR was measured in the presence of increasing concentrations of RGS10 (Fig. 5). When agonist-bound receptor drives GDP/GTP exchange in these vesicles, hydrolysis of Gi-bound GTP becomes rate-limiting and a GAP increases steady-state hydrolysis until the overall reaction again approaches the rate of receptor-catalyzed GDP/GTP exchange (29Biddlecome G.H. Berstein G. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7999-8007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 34Posner B.A. Mukhopadhyay S. Tesmer J.J. Gilman A.G. Ross E.M.

In m2AChR-Gi vesicles, RGS10 increases agonist-stimulated GTPase activity about 10-fold at 5 μM, the highest concentration tested (Fig. 5). Palmitoylation at Cys66 markedly potentiated the GAP activity of RGS10. Although we wer"

J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 1055-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In addition to playing a structural role, the SGC may have signaling functions (16Hack A.A. Cordier L. Shoturma D.I.

SGC consists of four transmembrane proteins: α-sarcoglycan, a type I transmembrane protein, and β-, γ-, and δ-sarcoglycans, which are type II transmembrane proteins. α- and γ-sarcoglycans are expressed exclusively in skeletal and cardiac muscle, whereas β- and δ-sarcoglycans are more widely distributed (11Noguchi S.

Mutations in any one of these four sarcoglycans cause autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, and mutations in the genes encoding individual sarcoglycans often lead to the concomitant loss or reduction of all sarcoglycans from the sarcolemma, suggesting that complex formation and localization of SGCs require all four subunits (9Straub V. Campbell K.P. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 1997; 10: 168-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Direct interaction between the sarcoglycans has also been demonstrated biochemically by co-immunoprecipitation (15Yoshida M. Suzuki A. Yamamoto H. Noguchi S. Mizuno Y. Ozawa E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 1055-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 22Chan Y.M. Bönnemann C.G. Lidov H.G.W. Kunkel L.M. J.

Transfection of Chinese hamster ovary cells with sarcoglycans indicates that all four sarcoglycans must be co-expressed for proper cell surface localization (23Holt K.H. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34667-34670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that α-, β-, γ-, and δ-sarcoglycans are subunits of a heterotetrameric molecule (16Hack A.A. Cordier L. Shoturma D.I. Lam M.Y. Sweeney H.L. McNally E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10723-10728Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). A fifth sarcoglycan, ε-sarcoglycan, was identified recently (24Ettinger A.J. Feng G. Sanes J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32534-32538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 25McNally E.M. Ly C.T. Kunkel L.M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). It is highly homologous to α-sarcoglycan, but like β- and δ-sarcoglycans it is widely expressed in various tissues (24Ettinger A.J. Feng G. Sanes J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32534-32538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). It has been reported that ε-sarcoglycan associates with β- and δ-sarcoglycans in smooth muscle (26Durbeej M. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26609-26616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Despite its homology to α-sarcoglycan and its presence in skeletal muscle, endogenous ε-sarcoglycan is unable to rescue phenotypes associated with α-sarcoglycan loss (27Duclos F. Straub V. Moore S.A. Venzke D.P. Hrstka R.F. Crosbie R.H. Durbeej M. Lebakken C.S. Ettinger A.J. van der Meulen J. Holt K.H. Lim L.E. Sanes J.R. Davidson B.L. Faulkner J.A. Williamson R. Campbell K.P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1461-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Therefore, in skeletal muscle ε-sarcoglycan could exist as a monomer, form a complex with proteins distinct from those that associate with α-sarcoglycan, or associate with β-, γ-, and δ-sarcoglycans to form SGC that is only partially able to compensate for the loss of α-sarcoglycan-containing complexes. Mice mutant in α-, β-, γ-, and δ-sarcoglycans have been generated experimentally by homologous recombination-dependent gene targeting (27Duclos F. Straub V. Moore S.A. Venzke D.P. Hrstka R.F.

A spontaneous null mutant, the δ-sarcoglycan-deficient hamster, also exists (31Nigro V. Okazaki Y. Belsito A. Piluso G. Matsuda Y. Politano L. Nigro G. Ventura C. Abbondanza C. Molinari A.M.

All sarcoglycan-deficient mice develop severe muscular dystrophies with varying involvement of heart muscle. The δ-sarcoglycan null mutant hamster succumbs from cardiomyopathy with less severe involvement of skeletal muscle. The C2C12 mouse myoblast cell line, a cell line widely used for studying myogenesis and muscle differentiation, has been used as a model system to study biosynthesis and assembly of sarcoglycans (21Liu L.

Here we use gene targeting and C2C12 cells to demonstrate that ε-sarcoglycan is indeed associated with β-, γ-, and δ-sarcoglycans in skeletal muscle in vivo and in vitro. We generate α-sarcoglycan-deficient mice and present evidence, using immunofluorescence and protein fractionation, that SGCs containing ε-, β-, γ-, and δ-sarcoglycans are expressed in striated muscle and that the localization of these complexes in the muscle is similar to the α-sarcoglycan-containing SGC. The existence of an ε-sarcoglycan-containing SGC may explain why residual levels of sarcoglycan expression are seen in mutant mice and patients with α-sarcoglycan deficiency (27Duclos F. Straub V.

The mouse α-sarcoglycan gene (asg) was isolated from a 129/SvJ mouse genomic library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) by hybridization with a mouse α-sarcoglycan cDNA probe (21Liu L. Vachon P.H. Kuang W. Xu H. Wewer U.M. Kylsten P. Engvall E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The targeting vector was designed to disrupt exons 1 and 2. A 15-kb fragment containing exons 1–6 of the α-sarcoglycan gene was subcloned into pBluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), characterized by restriction mapping, and sequenced. A 5.5-kb genomic fragment containing sequence upstream of the ATG site in exon 1, was amplified using the ExpandTMLong Template PCR System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with the forward primer 5′-GAGGGTGCGAGGGTGACAAGGAC-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-GGAAGTTACTGCTGCTGCCAT-3′. The 5.5-kb genomic PCR product was subcloned, sequenced, and used as the 5′ homologous region of the targeting vector. A 2-kb genomic PCR fragment containing the 3′ portion of exon 2 through exon 6 was amplified with primers 5′-CTGCGCCTTCCAGAACAC-3′ and 5′-ACCAGAGACACATTGCACCAG-3′. The PCR product was subcloned, sequenced, and used as the 3′ homologous region of the targeting vector. A cassette containing the LacZ with a nuclear localization signal and neo genes (nlsLacZ/neo) was inserted 21 base pairs downstream of the ATG initiation site. The diphtheria toxin A gene was inserted at the 3′ end of the targeting vector to select against random insertion events (37Yagi T. Ikawa Y. Yoshida K. Shigetani Y. Takeda N. Mabuchi I. Yamamoyo T.

A map of the α-sarcoglycan gene locus and the design of the targeting vector are shown in Fig. 1. SM38 ES cells, derived from 129/SvEv mice, 2H. Baribault and M. Andahazy, unpublished data. were transfected with the linearized targeting vector by electroporation and selected for growth in the presence of G418 (38Kuang W. Xu H. Vachon P.H. Liu L. Loechel F. Wewer U.M. Engvall E. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 844-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). G418-resistant ES cell clones were screened by Southern blotting ofBamHI-digested genomic DNA using a probe shown in Fig. 1. Two selected clones of targeted ES cells were injected separately into C57BL/6J blastocysts, and the blastocysts were transferred into pseudopregnant recipients. Chimeric male mice were identified by coat color and bred to C57BL/6J females. Genotypes were determined by Southern blot analysis of DNA from tail biopsies. The C2C12 mouse myoblast cell line (39Yaffe D. Saxel O. Nature. 1977; 270: 725-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Cells were cultured in dishes precoated with 50 μg/ml rat tail collagen type I (Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA) and maintained in low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 20% fetal calf serum (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT), 15 mm HEPES, and 20 mm glutamine at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Antibiotics were not used (21Liu L. Vachon P.H. Kuang W. Xu H. Wewer U.M. Kylsten P. Engvall E. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Myogenic differentiation was induced at confluence by replacing the growth medium with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% horse serum (HyClone). Mouse monoclonal antibodies against α-sarcoglycan (NCL-a-sarc), β-sarcoglycan (NCL-b-sarc), and γ-sarcoglycan (NCL-g-sarc) were purchased from Novocastra (Newcastle-upon-Tyne, United Kingdom). Affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody against ε-sarcoglycan was kindly provided by Dr. E. M. McNally (University of Chicago, Chicago, IL) and rabbit polyclonal antiserum against δ-sarcoglycan was kindly provided by Dr. V. Nigro (Second University of Naples, Naples, Italy). Rabbit polyclonal antisera against α- and ε-sarcoglycans were made against sequence-specific synthetic peptides coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Sigma) (41O'Sullivan M.J. Gnemmi E. Morris D. Chieregatti G. Simmonds A.D. Simmons M. Bridges J.W. Marks V. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 100-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) via an N-terminal cystein. The antibodies were affinity-purified with the respective peptide antigen coupled to UltraLink Iodoacetyl (Pierce). For some experiments, purified antibodies were coupled to UltraLink Biosupport (Pierce). Ten-μm transverse cryosections of thigh muscle were prepared from 8-week-old wild type, heterozygous, and homozygous α-sarcoglycan mutant mice. Fluorescent staining was performed by incubating sections for 1 h at 37 °C with affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies. After washing with PBS three times, sections were incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (ICN, Aurora, OH. 1:200) for 1 h at room temperature and then washed with PBS. Dilutions of all the antibodies were made in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin. Sections were mounted with Vectashield mounting medium for fluorescence (Vector, Burlingame, CA) and observed under an Axiovert 405M fluorescence microscope (Zeiss). For histological analysis, sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Total RNA was isolated using the Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Five μg of total RNA were reverse transcribed using RT-PCR kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The primers used were against nucleotides 317–335 (5′-CAGCCTACAATCGAGACAG-3′) and 554–574 (5′-GTCCCTCAATAGGAAGAGGGA-3′) of mouse α-sarcoglycan (21Liu L. Vachon P.H. Kuang W. Xu H. Wewer U.M. Kylsten P. Engvall E. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Feng G. Sanes J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32534-32538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). For β-sarcoglycan, primers were designed based on an expressed sequence tag sequence (GenBank accession no. AA269841) representing mouse β-sarcoglycan. The sense primer was from nucleotides 98–117 (5′-GCTGAGGTTCAAGCAAGTG-3′), and the antisense primer was from 444–461 (5′-CTTCGCACAATTGCACGC-3′). For γ- and δ-sarcoglycans, nucleotide sequences that are identical in man and hamster were chosen, namely for human γ-sarcoglycan, nucleotides 352–374 (5′-TCAGAAGGGGAGGTCACAGGCAG-3′) and 596–619 (5′-TTGGGGCATCCATGCTTAGACTCC-3′), and for human δ-sarcoglycan, nucleotides 139–162 (5′-CTGGTGAACTTGGCCATGACCATC-3′) and 332–356 (5′-GTCTGGTCATTGAGAATGTTCACTG-3′). The number of PCR amplification cycles (15, 25, and 30) was varied to allow a semiquantitative estimate of levels of transcripts. C2C12 cells were washed three times with cold PBS and incubated on ice for 15 min with 1 mg/ml NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce). The cells were washed once with PBS, and the residual NHS-LC-biotin was inactivated by incubating the cells in 0.1 m glycine in PBS on ice for 5 min. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture from Roche Molecular Biochemicals) on ice for 20 min and centrifuged at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The protein concentration of clarified lysates was measured with the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. For isolation of biotinylated proteins, lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 20 μl of streptavidin-Sepharose (Pierce). After washing three times with lysis buffer, bound proteins were eluted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting as described below. In some experiments, cell extracts prepared from biotinylated cultures were immunoprecipitated with Sepharose beads coupled with either anti-α- or anti-ε-sarcoglycan antibodies as described below. Skeletal muscle membrane proteins were prepared as described by Cohen et al.(42Cohen M.W. Jacobson C. Yurchenco P.D. Morris G.E. Carbonetto S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1047-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Three grams of mouse hindleg muscle were homogenized with a polytron (Biospec Products, Bartlesville, OK) in 20 ml of homogenization buffer (20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 20 mm sodium phosphate monohydrate, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.3 m sucrose, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.0) containing protease inhibitors. The homogenate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. The pellet was extracted again with 10 ml buffer and centrifuged. The pooled supernatants were centrifuged at 30,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min to obtain the heavy microsome fraction. The pellet was washed with a KCl solution (0.6 m KCl, 0.3 msucrose, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing protease inhibitors) at 4 °C with agitation for 30 min, and then centrifuged at 142,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The pellet was solubilized in lysis buffer by incubation on ice for 15 min, then clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. One hundred μg of protein from extracts of cells or microsomes were incubated with 15 μl of Sepharose-bound, affinity-purified antibodies against α- or ε-sarcoglycan at 4 °C overnight. The Sepharose beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, and bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 4–20% gradient gels (Novex, San Diego, CA). Proteins were transferred from SDS-PAGE gels to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). The MultiMark standard was used for markers (Novex). In immunoblotting experiments, antisera against α-, β-, and γ-sarcoglycans were used at 1:100 dilution, and antisera against δ-sarcoglycan at 1:10,000 dilution. Goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with peroxidase (Bio-Rad) was used at a 1:2,000 dilution, and goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with peroxidase (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) was used at a 1:5,000 dilution. For detecting cell surface localization of SGCs, streptavidin conjugated with peroxidase (Pierce) was used at a 1:1,000 dilution. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL+PLUS system; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In order to design a targeting vector to generate α-sarcoglycan-null mice, we cloned a large portion of the mouse asg gene. Exons 1 and 2 were chosen for targeting to delete the signal sequence and disrupt the gene. Homologous recombination replaced the major portions of exons 1 and 2 and the entire first intron with the nlsLacZ/neo. The disruption of the asg gene in one allele of ES cells was verified by Southern blots of BamHI-digested genomic DNA with a flanking probe (Fig. 1). In properly targeted clones, this probe hybridized to two fragments: an 11-kb BamHI fragment, indicating the disrupted allele, and a 7.5-kb fragment from the wild type allele. In order to confirm a single integration of the nlsLacZ/neo gene, digested DNA from mutant clones were also hybridized to neo andLacZ gene sequences. Two ES cell clones with the correct genotype were injected into C57BL/6J blastocysts to generate chimeric mice. These mice were bred to obtain two lines of asg −/− mice. Immunofluorescence analysis showed no expression of α-sarcoglycan in homozygous mutant mice (Fig. 2 b), and absence of α-sarcoglycan was confirmed by immunoblotting (see below and Fig. 3 A), indicating that the targeting vector used had created a null allele. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that the expression and localization of ε-sarcoglycan were not affected in null mutant mice (Fig. 2 d). This is in agreement with previous work (27Duclos F. Straub V. Moore S.A. Venzke D.P. Hrstka R.F. Crosbie R.H. Durbeej M. Lebakken C.S. Ettinger A.J. van der Meulen J. Holt K.H. Lim L.E. Sanes J.R. Davidson B.L. Faulkner J.A. Williamson R. Campbell K.P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1461-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence analysis further showed that β-sarcoglycan was present but reduced (Fig. 2 c). In agreement with other reports, γ- and δ-sarcoglycans were also reduced in amounts as measured by immunofluorescence and/or immunoblotting (data not shown). The presence of ε-sarcoglycan and the residual expression of β-, γ-, and δ-sarcoglycans suggested that a complex containing ε-, β-, γ -, and δ-sarcoglycans might exist in the mutant mouse muscle.FIG. 3A, co-isolation of sarcoglycans inasg −/− mice and wild type littermates using anti-β-sarcoglycan antibodies. Heavy microsomes were isolated from wild type and mutant mouse muscle, extracted, and incubated with β-sarcoglycan antibodies. The isolates from 80 μg of extract were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting. α-sarcoglycan is absent in the isolates from mutant mice, whereas ε-sarcoglycan is associated with β-sarcoglycan in both wild type and mutant mice. B, co-isolation of sarcoglycans in normal muscle using anti-α- or anti-ε-sarcoglycan antibodies. One hundred μg of protein from extracts of microsomes was immunoprecipitated with either anti-α- or anti-ε-sarcoglycan antibodies. The immune complexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibodies against α-, β-, γ-, δ-, and ε-sarcoglycans. ε-Sarcoglycan was undetectable in the preparation isolated with anti-α-sarcoglycan antibodies andvice versa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine whether β-sarcoglycan in mutant mouse muscle is associated with the other sarcoglycans, we used β-sarcoglycan antibody beads to isolate SGCs from wild type and mutant mouse muscle and analyzed such complexes for the presence of α-, γ-, and ε-sarcoglycans (Fig. 3 A) as well as for δ-sarcoglycan (data not shown). All these sarcoglycans co-isolated with β-sarcoglycan from extracts of wild type muscle, suggesting that α- and ε-sarcoglycans may be present in the same complex with β-sarcoglycan or form separate complexes with β-sarcoglycan. Fromasg null mutant mice, the β-sarcoglycan antibody co-isolated ε-, γ-, and δ-sarcoglycans, suggesting the existence of an ε-β-γ-δ complex. To determine if an ε-β-γ-δ complex is also present in normal muscle, we carried out immunoisolation with antibodies against either α- or ε-sarcoglycan, followed by immunoblotting analysis to detect the individual sarcoglycans within the isolates (Fig. 3 B). Anti-α-sarcoglycan antibody co-isolated β-, γ-, and δ-sarcoglycans, but not ε-sarcoglycan.

However, the heparan sulfates modified by 3-OST-2 and 3-OST-3A, isoforms of 3-OST-1, do not have anticoagulant activity, although these isoforms transfer sulfate to the 3-OH position of glucosamine residues. In this study, we characterize the substrate specificity of purified 3-OST-3A at the tetrasaccharide level. The 3-OST-3A enzyme was purified from Sf9 cells infected with recombinant baculovirus containing 3-OST-3A cDNA. Two 3-OST-3A-modified tetrasaccharides were purified from the 3-O-35S-sulfated heparan sulfate that was digested by heparin lyases. These tetrasaccharides were analyzed using nitrous acid and enzymatic degradation combined with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry. Two novel tetrasaccharides were discovered with proposed structures of ΔUA2S-GlcNS-IdoUA2S-[35S]GlcNH23S and ΔUA2S-GlcNS-IdoUA2S-[3-35S]GlcNH23S6S. The results demonstrate that 3-OST-3A sulfatesN-unsubstituted glucosamine residues, and the 3-OST-3A modification sites are probably located in defined oligosaccharide sequences. Our study suggests that oligosaccharides withN-unsubstituted glucosamine are precursors for sulfation by 3-OST-3A. The intriguing linkage between N-unsubstituted glucosamine and the 3-O-sulfation by 3-OST-3A may provide a clue to the potential biological functions of 3-OST-3A-modified heparan sulfate. 3-O-Sulfation of glucosamine by heparan sulfate d-glucosaminyl 3-O-sulfotransferase (3-OST-1) is the key modification in anticoagulant heparan sulfate synthesis.

HS are present on the cell surface as well as in the extracellular matrix and bind to proteins involved in anticoagulation, angiogenesis (1Rosenberg R.D. Shworak N.W. Liu J. Schwartz J.J. Zhang L. J.

Despite the recent success in cloning HS biosynthetic enzymes, the mechanisms for generating HS with defined monosaccharide sequences are still poorly understood. However, several biological functions of HS are believed to be dictated by unique sulfated saccharide sequences, and the HS biosynthetic enzymes regulate the synthesis of these oligosaccharides (1Rosenberg R.D. Shworak N.W. Liu J. Schwartz J.J. Zhang L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2062-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Indeed, 3-OST-1 is up-regulated at the transcriptional level in F9 cells to control the biosynthesis of anticoagulantly active HS (HSact) and 3-O-sulfated anticoagulantly inactive HS, which are thought to affect cell differentiation (11Zhang L.

Choay J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6723-6729Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). This critical 3-O-sulfation is performed by 3-OST-1 (EC 2.8.2.23) (10Shworak N.W. Liu J. Fritze L.M.S.

By using purified 3-OST-1, we found that there are six antithrombin-binding sites in a single HSact chain, suggesting that the synthesis of HSact is a highly organized process requiring a specific biosynthetic pathway (16Zhang L.

In this paper, we characterize the substrate specificity of heparan sulfate 3-O-sulfotransferase 3A (3-OST-3A) at the tetrasaccharide level using purified enzyme. 3-OST-3A transfers sulfate to the 3-OH position of N-unsubstituted glucosamine (GlcNH2) as determined by MALDI-MS coupled with nitrous acid and enzymatic degradations. Our results suggest an intriguing linkage between the GlcNH2 residue and 3-O-sulfation by 3-OST-3A.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialspcDNA3 plasmid containing 3-OST-3A was prepared as described previously (17Liu J.

For Western blotting, 0.5 ng of 3-OST-3A was resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) with a Bio-Rad Trans-Blot semidry electroblot system, in 10 mm CAPS, 10% methanol, pH 11, at 45 V for 90 min. The membrane was blocked with 5% fetal bovine serum in PBST (0.05% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline) and incubated with antibody PB1437 in PBST. After washing, the blot was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat IgG anti-chicken IgY (Aves Laboratories).

MALDI-MS spectra were acquired in the linear mode by using a PerSeptive Biosystem Voyager Elite reflectron time-of-flight instrument fitted with a 337-nm nitrogen laser. Mass spectra were calibrated by using the signals for protonated (Arg-Gly)19-Arg and its complex with a hexasaccharide standard of the sequence IdoUA2S-GlcNS6S-IdoUA2S-GlcNS6S-IdoUA2S-AnMan6S.Determination of the Amount of N-Unsubstituted Glucosamine in HSThe amount of N-unsubstituted glucosamine was determined by using o-phthalaldehyde as described by Roth (27Roth M. Anal. Chem. 1971; 43: 880-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar). To validate this method, we have determined the amount ofN-unsubstituted glucosamine in the HS from bovine kidney (ICN). We found that the level of N-unsubstituted glucosamine of the HS from bovine kidney (ICN) is 1.5% (w/w), which is very close to the published value of 1.6% (w/w) by Toida et al. (28Toida T. Yoshida H. Toyoda H. Koshishi I. Imanari T. Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R. Linhardt R.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) using the same method.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we investigated the substrate specificity of 3-OST-3A at the tetrasaccharide level. This enzyme was previously identified as a heparan sulfate 3-O-sulfotransferase, and the substrate specificity was characterized at the disaccharide level (17Liu J. Shworak N.W. Sinay P.

In order to lay the foundation for studying the biological functions of 3-OST-3A, it is necessary to define the substrate specificity of 3-OST-3A at the oligosaccharide level. Furthermore, it is important to utilize purified recombinant enzyme in those studies to eliminate the potential confounding effects of other heparan sulfate sulfotransferases. We expressed 3-OST-3A enzyme in Sf9 cells and purified the recombinant enzyme from serum-free medium. We then35S-sulfated HS by using purified enzyme and [35S]PAPS and digested the product with a mixture of heparin lyases to obtain Tetra A and Tetra B. The structures of Tetra A and Tetra B were determined to be ΔUA2S-GlcNS-IdoUA2S-GlcNH23S and ΔUA2S-GlcNS-IdoUA2S-GlcNH23S6S, respectively. Neither of these two structures has been reported previously. We found a trisulfated disaccharide with a structure of IdoUA2S-[3-35S]AnMan6S3S in the low pH nitrous acid-degraded 3-OST-3A-modified [35S]HS. This disaccharide was not identified in our previous study (17Liu J. Shworak N.W. Sinay P. Schwartz J.J. Zhang L. Fritze L.M.S. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5185-5192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), because this component was not eluted from a C18-HPLC column with the conditions used. We have now identified this novel disaccharide and found that it was part of the structure of Tetra B.Our results demonstrated that the [35S]sulfate-labeling sites of Tetra A and Tetra B are at the 3-OH position of theN-unsubstituted glucosamine residue (GlcNH2), proving that 3-OST-3A transfers sulfate to GlcNH2 and GlcNH26S residues. We identified GlcNH2residues in Tetra A and Tetra B based upon high pH (pH 4.0) nitrous acid degradation followed by the analysis on PAMN-HPLC and MALDI-MS. Our data indicate that deamination of GlcNH23S or GlcNH23S6S residue also occurs at pH 1.5. It is worthwhile to note that N-unsubstituted glucosamine residues react with nitrous acid at pH 4.0, and N-sulfated glucosamine residues react with nitrous acid at pH 1.5 (32Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). However, such specificity is not absolute, as nitrous acid reacts with N-unsubstituted glucosamine and N-sulfated glucosamine at pH 3, although at a slower rate (34Guo Y. Conrad H.E. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 176: 96-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the conclusions of the specificity study of nitrous acid degradation are based on model compounds that do not contain 3-O-sulfation. Because that 3-O-sulfate group is located adjacent to the free amino group that reacts with nitrous acid, it is possible that 3-O-sulfate affects the reactivity of the nearby amino group to nitrous acid at low pH. Indeed, we have found that glucosamine 3-O-sulfate monosaccharide is susceptible to nitrous acid treatment at pH 1.5 to yield 2,5-anhydromannitol 3-O-sulfate, although the amount of such product is about 20-fold less than that of the monosaccharide treated by nitrous acid at pH 4.0. 5Glucosamine 3-O-sulfate (100 μg, from Sigma) was incubated with nitrous acid at high (pH 4.0) and low pH (pH 1.5) as described under “Experimental Procedures” followed by sodium [3H]borohydride (2 mCi, 25 mCi/mmol) reduction. The products were desalted on Bio-Gel P-2. We obtained 3.8 × 106 cpm of 3H-labeled monosaccharides from high pH nitrous acid-treated glucosamine 3-O-sulfate and 3.6 × 106 cpm of 3H-labeled monosaccharide from low pH nitrous acid-treated glucosamine 3-O-sulfate. The3H-labeled monosaccharide (about 9,000 cpm) was analyzed on RPIP-HPLC using an elution condition described in our prior publication (17Liu J. Shworak N.W. Sinay P. Schwartz J.J. Zhang L. Fritze L.M.S. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5185-5192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). We have found that nearly 95% of 3H counts from high pH nitrous acid-treated glucosamine 3-O-sulfate is [3H]AnMan3S, as judged by co-eluting with the standard on RPIP-HPLC. We have also found that about 5% of 3H counts from low pH nitrous acid-treated glucosamine 3-O-sulfate is [3H]AnMan3S, and 95% of the 3H counts was eluted at nonsulfated"

A significant fraction of the micronuclei were CREST-negative, reflective of lost acentric chromosome fragments. Some of the instability observed was due to mitotic events, consistent with the increased formation of bi-nucleated cells, which result from perturbations of the mitotic spindle and failure to undergo cytokinesis.

McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1761) Google Scholar). They are in their activated state when bound to GTP, and are inactivated by GTP hydrolysis. This intrinsic GTPase activity is enhanced by association with GTPase-activating protein (1Boguski M. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1761) Google Scholar). The Ras proteins transduce signals from ligand-activated tyrosine kinase receptors to downstream effectors (2Bokoch G. Der C. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 750-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Activating mutations, such as those in EJ Ras, can impair GTP hydrolysis and lead to constitutively activated Ras that impacts the cellular phenotype (3Gibbs J. Sigal I. Poe M. Scolnick E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5704-5708Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Oncogenic Ras can lead to cellular transformation (4Shih C. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1982; 29: 161-169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar), presumably by perturbing its signal transduction pathways. Among the most thoroughly studied of the Ras-mediated pathways is the threonine/serine MAP1 kinase cascade (5Johnson G. Vaillancourt R. Curr. Opin.

In NIH 3T3 cells, selective induction of the human EJ Ha-ras oncogene expression leads to potentially deleterious cellular phenotypes such as premature entry of cells into S phase (32Liu H.S.

Oncogenic Ras also induces the generation of chromosome aberrations such as dicentric chromosomes, acentric chromosomes, and double minute chromosomes (33Denko N. Giaccia A. Stringer J. Stambrook P.

Carcinogen. 1991; 4: 460-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Chromosome aberrations induced by oncogenic Ras lead to improper segregation of chromosomes and the consequent exclusion of chromosomes from daughter nuclei (37Hagag N. Diamond L. Palermo R.

Overexpression of oncogenic ras also produces chromosome aberrations in rat mammary carcinoma cells (39Ichikawa T. Kyprianou N. Isaacs J.T. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6349-6357PubMed Google Scholar), in rat prostatic tumor cells (40Ichikawa T. Schalken J.A. Ichikawa Y. Steinberg G.D. Isaacs J.T. Prostate. 1991; 18: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and in a human colon carcinoma cell line (41de Vries J.E. Kornips F.H.A. Marx P. Bosman F.T. Geraedts J.P.M. Kate J. Cancer Genet. Cytogenet. 1993; 65: 35-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Thus, one of the major consequences of oncogenicras in carcinogenesis is destabilization of the karyotype. Since Ras serves as a focal point for multiple signal transduction pathways, we have examined whether activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway is sufficient to induce chromosome instability. To this end, we have expressed constitutively activated ras, and mos(a serine threonine kinase known to activate primarily the MAPK pathway) in NIH3T3 cells, and have used specific inhibitors of MAPKK-1 and -2 to assess the role of the MAPK pathway in inducing chromosome instability. Overexpression of oncogenic ras andmos resulted in chromosome instability, as measured by a standard micronucleus assay (42Nusse M. Beisker W. Kramer J. Miller B.M. Schreiber G.A. Viaggi S. Weller E.M. Wessels J. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 42: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This chromosome instability is mediated by activation of the MAPK pathway, and was characterized, in part, by whole chromosome loss, as well as chromosome fragment loss. Infectivity of ecotropic cell lines producing empty Murine leukemia virus (MuLV), v-ras (MSV-Ha-ras), and v-moshas been calculated to be between 5 and 10 viral particles per cell (43Fukasawa K. Vande Woude G.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 506-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Between 1 and 2 × 105 NIH 3T3 cells were plated in 6-well plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's high glucose medium containing penicillin/streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine serum. Infections with MuLV, as with v-mos and v-ras retroviruses were carried out with 4 μg/ml Polybrene for 4–8 h. For experiments involving the MAPKK inhibitors PD98059 and U0126, cells were infected with v-ras as described above and the inhibitors were applied at concentrations of 75 μmfor PD98059 and 50, 80, and 100 μm for U0126. Wortmannin was applied at a concentration of 1 μm. Fresh inhibitor was applied every 2 days. Cellular proteins were isolated by lysing cells in RIPA solution (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) in the presence of protease inhibitors (aprotinin, 0.1 μg/ml; leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml; pepstatin, 1 μg/ml; phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml;N α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, 50 μg/ml; andl-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, 100 μg/ml) and phosphatase inhibitors (5 mm sodium fluoride and 0.01 mm sodium orthovanadate) and incubating at 4 °C for 15 min (44Lane D. Harlow E. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring, NY1988Google Scholar). Protein lysates (50 μg) were denatured in 2% SDS, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 60 mm Tris, pH 6.8, and 0.1% bromphenol blue, and loaded onto a 12% polyacrylamide/SDS gel. The separated proteins were then transferred by electroblot (100 mA, 1 h) onto a PVDF-Plus membrane (Micron Separations Inc., Westborough, MA). The blot was blocked in 1 × TBS (0.2m Tris-Cl, 1.37 m NaCl, pH 7.6), 0.2% Tween 20, 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h, incubated either with antibody against Ras (Santa Cruz Laboratories, Santa Cruz, CA), phosphorylated p42/p44 MAPK, phosphorylated AKT (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), phosphorylated p38, phosphorylated JNK or MAPK-2 (Santa Cruz Laboratories, Santa Cruz, CA). After washing with 1 × TBS, 0.2% Tween 20, 5% nonfat dry milk, the membrane was incubated with an anti-IgG antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad), and then washed in 1 × TBS, 0.1% Tween 20. The ECL non-radioactive detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was utilized to detect the antibody-protein complexes by exposure of the membrane to a Kodak X-Omat autoradiography film. The micronucleus assay was performed using a standard procedure (42Nusse M. Beisker W. Kramer J. Miller B.M. Schreiber G.A. Viaggi S. Weller E.M. Wessels J. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 42: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were trypsinized 5–7 days after infection, centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 3 min in a table top centrifuge, and lysed in 600 μl of solution I (10 mmNaCl, 3.4 mm sodium citrate, 0.001% (w/v) RNase A, 0.03% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with 0.2 μl of 5 mm sytox (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) and incubated at 25 °C for 1 h. This incubation was followed by addition of 600 μl of solution II (1.4% citric acid, 0.25 m sucrose) supplemented with 2 μl of propidium iodide (PI) (10 mg/ml). Micronuclei (particles staining with both sytox and PI with a size range of 1/100–1/10 the mean size of a G1 nucleus) were analyzed using a Coulter EPICS XL flow cytometer (Miami, FL) at an excitation range of 488 nm (argon laser) and a 525 band-pass filter for sytox and 620 band-pass for PI. Quantitation of micronuclei was based on 10,000 cells counted. The frequency of micronucleus formation was confirmed by visual observation of PI-stained nuclei by fluorescence microscopy. Analysis of micronuclei by immunocytochemistry has been described previously (45Schiriever-Schwemmer G. Adler I-D.

Cells were fixed with 3.8% paraformaldehyde, washed with PBS, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.025% SDS, for 5 min and blocked with 10% goat serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.01% sodium azide in PBS, for 2 h at 25 °C, and stained with the anti-kinetochore antibody CREST (Antibodies Inc., Davis, CA) at a 1:10 dilution in blocking solution for 24 h at 4 °C. After washing, cells were incubated in anti-human Alexa-488-coupled antibody (Molecular Probes) at a 1:500 dilution in blocking solution for 1–2 h at 25 °C, followed by washing in 1× PBS and staining with antifade solution (Vectashield, Vector Laboratories) containing propidium iodide (5 μg/ml). Three to five optical sections of cells containing micronuclei were analyzed on a Bio-Rad confocal microscope (Kalman mode). The percentage of CREST positive cells were then calculated for each experimental condition. The same slides were utilized to calculate the percentage of micronuclei, binucleated cells, and fragmented cells in the population. Cells (105) were plated into each well of a 6-well tissue culture dish and infected with MuLV or v-ras in the presence or absence of PD98059, U0126, or wortmannin. Cells were collected and fixed in 70% ethanol at 4 °C, washed in 1 × PBS, resuspended in a solution containing 100 μg of PI, and 1 mg of RNase A, 10 ml of PBS, and analyzed by flow cytometry (53Darzynkiewicz Z.

The percentage of cells in G1, S, and G2/M was based on 10,000 cells counted. Cells (5 × 104) were plated onto gelatinized (0.1% gelatin in PBS) 2-well plastic culture chambers (Fisher, St. Louis, MO). Cells were infected with MuLV and v-ras as described above in the presence or absence of PD98059, U0126, or wortmannin. Five days after infection, cells were stained as follows (54Zecevic M. Catling A.D. Eblen S.T. Renzi L. Hittle J.C. Yen T.J. Gorbsky G.J. Weber M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1547-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar): cells were rinsed with PHEM (60 mm Pipes, 25 mm Hepes, pH 6.9, 10 mm EGTA, 4 mm MgSO4 fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, washed in PHEM, and extracted for 5 min at room temperature with PHEM plus 1% CHAPS. Cells were rinsed with MBST (10 mm MOPS, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% Tween 20, pH 7.4) and blocked in 20% normal goat serum in MBST for 2 h. Cells were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature in MBST containing 5% normal goat serum and rabbit anti-γ (1:200 dilution) and mouse anti-β-tubulin (1:200 dilution) antibodies (Sigma). Cells were washed three times in MBST for 5 min each wash, and incubated with MBST containing 5% normal goat serum and anti-rabbit Alexa-488 and anti-mouse Alexa-546 secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed three times in MBST at room temperature for 5 min each wash and counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Sigma) at 0.5 μg/ml. Cells were visualized using a standard fluorescence microscopy and a ×100 objective. NIH 3T3 cells were infected with either virus harboring oncogenic ras (MSV-Ha-ras, in short, v-ras) or MuLV, the parental virus. To test for expression of Ras, pools of NIH 3T3 cells infected withMuLV or v-ras were first analyzed by Western blots using anti-Ras antibody as a probe (Fig. 1). Cells infected with v-ras(Fig. 1, lane 2), but not those infected with controlMuLV (Fig. 1, lane 1), expressed an increased level of RAS. Equal loading was monitored by using an antibody against MAPK-2 (Fig. 1). Since the MAPK pathway is a major signal transduction pathway activated by RAS (5Johnson G. Vaillancourt R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 230-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 6Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.A. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 65: 48-139Google Scholar, 7Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4236) Google Scholar), we have assessed the extent to which v-ras is able to induce MAPK activation in the infected cells. Phosphorylation of MAPK was monitored by Western blots, using an antibody directed against phosphorylated p42/p44 MAPK. Transduction of exponentially growing cells with v-ras (Fig. 2 A, lane 3) or v-mos (Fig. 2 A, lane 2) induced higher MAPK activation than in cells transduced with MuLV (Fig. 2 A, lane 1). Treatment of ras-transduced cells with the specific MAPKK inhibitors PD98059 and U0126 resulted in reduction of MAPK phosphorylation (Fig. 2 A, lanes 4–6). The inhibitor concentration resulting in 50% inhibition of MAPK activation was 75 μm for PD98059; 50 μm U0126 resulted in 75% inhibition of MAPK activation. Treatment of v-ras-infected cells with 80 μm U0126 resulted in 90% inhibition of MAPK activation, and 100 μmresulted in total inhibition of MAPK activation (not shown). Transduction with v-ras also resulted in the activation of the PI3K pathway, as determined by an increase in the phosphorylation of AKT (Fig. 2 B, lane 2). Treatment of v-ras-transduced cells with 1 μm wortmannin resulted in total inhibition of AKT phosphorylation. Ras did not result in a detectable activation of the JNK or p38 proteins (data not shown). Transduction with v-ras or v-mos resulted in a change in cellular morphology characteristic of transformation (Fig. 3, B and C). Cellular transformation induced by v-ras was dependent on phosphorylation of MAPK by MAPKK as indicated by the capacity of the MAPKK inhibitor U0126 to revert cells to a flat morphology (Fig. 3 D). Treatment with wortmannin had no effect on cellular morphology (not shown).FIG. 3Expression of ras andmos transforms NIH3T3 cells via activation of MAPK.

To confirm thatras and mos induce genomic instability in NIH 3T3 cells, chromosome instability was assessed by the generation of micronuclei. This measure has been used as a marker of whole chromosome loss or chromosome fragment loss induced by DNA-damaging agents such as ionizing radiation, or by agents that interfere with the proper functioning of the mitotic spindle and lead to aneuploidy (45Schiriever-Schwemmer G.

Immunocytochemical observation of cells infected with MuLV, v-ras, or v-mos (Fig. 4) revealed that overexpression of v-ras (Fig. 4, B and D) and v-mos (Fig. 4 C) induced loss of chromosomes, revealed by the appearance of micronuclei in the cytoplasm. Analysis of micronucleus formation by flow cytometry (Fig. 5) and independently by immunocytochemistry (Fig. 6) showed that overexpression of oncogenic ras and mos induced the formation of micronuclei. At the high levels of active MAPK induced by v-ras, the frequency of micronucleus formation rose to 8.6-fold (Figs. 5 and 6), whereas transduction with v-mosresulted in a 2.1-fold increase in micronucleus formation (data not shown). Since increases in growth rates can potentially lead to increases in genomic instability, we calculated doubling times for cells infected with v-ras and vector controls. In cells overexpressing v-ras, there was a significant increase in the doubling time (Table I).FIG. 5Ras induces loss of chromosomes, as measured by the micronucleus assay.

In order to define signaling pathways downstream of VEGF receptors (VEGFR), the kinase domain of VEGFR2 (Flk-1) was used as a bait to screen a human fetal heart library in the yeast two-hybrid system. One of the signaling molecules identified in this effort was HCPTPA, a low molecular weight, cytoplasmic protein tyrosine phosphatase. Although HCPTPA possesses no identifiable phosphotyrosine binding domains (i.e. SH2 or phosphotyrosine binding domains), it bound specifically to active, autophosphorylated VEGFR2 but not to a mutated, kinase-inactive VEGFR2. Recombinant VEGFR2 and endogenous VEGFR2 were substrates for recombinant HCPTPA, and HCPTPA was co-expressed with VEGFR2 in endothelial cell lines, suggesting that HCPTPA may be a negative regulator of VEGFR2 signal transduction. To pursue this possibility, an adenovirus directing the expression of HCPTPA was constructed. When used to infect cultured endothelial cells, this adenovirus directed high level expression of HCPTPA that resulted in impairment of VEGF-mediated VEGFR2 autophosphorylation and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of HCPTPA also inhibited VEGF-induced cellular responses (endothelial cell migration and proliferation) and inhibited angiogenesis in the rat aortic ring assay. Taken together, these findings indicate that HCPTPA may be an important regulator of VEGF-mediated signaling and biological activity.

Typically, endothelial cells in the adult vasculature turn over extremely slowly, and the growth of new blood vessels occurs only in rare settings, such as during wound healing and during cyclic changes in the ovary and uterus. Recently, however, it has become increasingly clear that the tight controls on vascular growth in adult tissues can be breached in pathologic states such as cancer, arthritis, and diabetic retinopathy (1Folkman J. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (7217) Google Scholar). Because uncontrolled vascular growth is now known to play a role in the development of these so-called “angiogenic” diseases, an intense effort has developed to determine the molecular and cellular mechanisms that control vascular growth. A recent flurry of reports has underscored the importance of signaling by endothelial receptor tyrosine kinases in vascular development. In particular, two families of endothelium-specific receptor tyrosine kinases, the VEGF receptor family and the novel Tie family of receptors, have been shown to play crucial, non-redundant roles in vascular assembly during embryonic development (2Folkman J. D'Amore P.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 1153-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar, 3Hanahan D.

Moreover, signaling by both the VEGF1receptor family and the Tie family of receptors has been shown to play important roles in pathologic angiogenesis in adult tissues (5Kim K.J. Li B. Winer J.

Clearly, to understand fully the precise nature of the roles of receptor tyrosine kinases in vascular development, it will be necessary to understand the signaling pathways that drive the cellular responses downstream of these receptors as well as the mechanisms by which receptor activation is modulated. In this report, the kinase domain of one of the VEGF receptors, VEGFR2 (Flk-1/KDR), was used as a bait in the yeast two-hybrid system to screen for candidate signaling molecules that lie in the VEGF pathway (11Quinn T.P.

The VEGFR2 kinase domain was a substrate for HCPTPA bothin vitro and in vivo, and when overexpressed, HCPTPA inhibited VEGF-mediated responses in cultured endothelial cells. Furthermore, overexpression of HCPTPA inhibited angiogenesis in the rat aortic ring assay, a model of angiogenesis that has been shown to be dependent on VEGF receptor signaling (15Nicosia R.F. Lin Y.J. Hazelton D. Qian X.H. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 1379-1386PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggest that HCPTPA may be an important negative regulator of VEGF receptor signaling and VEGF-mediated angiogenesis. Human recombinant VEGF 165 was obtained from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Anti-Flk-1 antibodies (C-20 and 1158), anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10 or Py20), and protein A-agarose were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology or Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase and anti-p44/42 MAP kinase antibodies were purchased from New England Biolabs. The anti-HCPTPA antibody was developed as described previously (14Wo Y.Y. McCormack A.L.

Primary cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were obtained from Clonetics Corp. (San Diego, CA). ECRF 24, an immortalized HUVEC cell line, was provided by Dr. Hans Pannekoek (University of Amsterdam). Endothelial cells were maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in endothelial growth medium (EGM, Clonetics Corp.) and grown on 2% gelatin-coated (Sigma) plates. Endothelial cells were serum-starved in EBM (Clonetics Corp.). Another endothelial cell line, EA.hy926, was provided by Cora-Jean Edgell (University of North Carolina) and was maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1 mmhypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (Sigma). All yeast plasmid vectors and yeast strains were generously provided by Roger Brent (Harvard University). For generation of bait plasmids, a cDNA encoding the entire intracellular domain of murine VEGFR2 (Flk-1) was cloned by PCR from reverse-transcribed mouse embryo mRNA. To obtain a kinase-inactive VEGFR2, site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a commercially available kit (Transformer; CLONTECH) to mutate lysine 866 to arginine (Flk-1KR). Both the wild-type and the mutated VEGFR2 kinases were subcloned into the yeast bait vector, pJK-202, downstream of the LexA DNA binding domain to create plasmids encoding a LexA/VEGFR2 fusion protein (pJK-Flk-1 and pJK-Flk-1KR). For library screening, pJK-Flk-1 was transformed into yeast strain EGY191/pJK103; yeast expressing the LexA-Flk-1 bait were then transformed with a human fetal heart plasmid (pJG4-5) library. Library proteins that interacted with the intracellular domain of Flk-1 were selected and tested for specificity essentially as described previously (16Kontos C. Stauffer T. Yang W.-P. York J. Huang L. Blanar M. Meyer T. Peters K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4131-4140Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Recombinant Flk-1 kinase was expressed as a carboxyl-terminal fusion with glutathione S-transferase (GST) in Sf9 insect cells using the baculovirus system as described previously (17Huang L. Turck C.W. Rao P. Peters K.G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2097-2103PubMed Google Scholar). The SHC SH2 domain (SHC-SH2) was expressed as a carboxyl-terminal GST fusion protein in Escherichia coli BL21 (F−, ompT, rB− mB−) strain. GST fusion proteins were purified from clarified Sf9 cells or E. coli lysates by glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) chromatography. Recombinant HCPTPA was produced in E. colias described previously (14Wo Y.Y. McCormack A.L. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Davis J.P. Mitchell G.L. Van Etten R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10856-10865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, GST-Flk-1 (10 μg) was immobilized on 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads. Subsequently, the beads were incubated for 10 min at room temperature in 50 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1m NaCl, 12 mm MgCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol), 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After thorough washing in 1× kinase buffer, labeled protein was eluted with 10 mm glutathione in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Radiolabeled Flk-1 was then aliquoted and incubated with 4 μg of BSA or increasing amounts of HCPTPA at 30 °C for 10 min. The protein mixture was then separated by 8% SDS-PAGE, analyzed by autoradiography, and quantified on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. For assaying dephosphorylation of endogenous VEGFR2 by HCPTPA, ECRF24 cells were quiesced in EBM medium (Clonetics) for 24 h and then incubated in the presence or absence of VEGF (25 ng/ml) for another 5 min at 37 °C. Following VEGF stimulation, the cells were lysed, and VEFGR2 was immunoprecipitated using a commercially available anti-Flk-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and immobilized on protein A-agarose. Protein A-agarose beads were washed and incubated in the absence or presence of purified recombinant HCPTPA at 30 °C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 2× sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. Samples were divided into 2 aliquots, separated by 8% PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with either an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody or the anti-Flk-1 antibody. GST-Flk-1 fusion protein was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads, autophosphorylated in vitro,and eluted from the beads using thrombin to cleave the Flk-1 kinase from the GST moiety. Following thrombin treatment, soluble Flk-1 was isolated by pelleting the agarose beads and harvesting the supernatant. To test the effect of dephosphorylation of VEGFR2 on substrate association, GST-SHC-SH2 was immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads followed by the addition of Flk-1 kinase (50 ng) that had been either untreated or treated with HCPTPA. The mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C, and the beads were washed thoroughly with 1× PBS to remove unbound Flk-1 kinase. Protein complexes were then eluted with 10 mm glutathione, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by serial blotting with anti-Flk-1 and anti-Tyr(P). To construct an adenovirus directing the expression of HCPTPA (AdHCPTP), a cDNA encoding the full-length HCPTPA fused at its amino terminus with an influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag was subcloned into an adenoviral transfer vector (18Channon K.M.

After excision from the transfer vector, the cDNA encoding the HCPTPA/HA fusion protein and the 5′ adenoviral sequences was directly ligated to DNA encoding an E1/E3 deleted adenoviral genome, and the ligation product was transfected into 293 cells. AdHCPTP from the transfected 293 cells was purified by banding twice on CsCl gradients; viral titers were determined by optical densitometry, and recombinant virus was stored in 10% (v/v) glycerol at −20 °C. AdGFP, which directs the expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP), was also grown and purified as described above and used as a control virus. This virus was a gift from Dr. Peter Corry (William Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak, MI). HUVECs were grown on 10-cm tissue culture plates in EGM. When confluent, the medium was changed to minimum essential medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum, and AdHCPTP or AdGFP viral stocks were added to the medium at a multiplicity of infection of 10. After 24 h, the cells were placed in quiescence medium (EBM) for 24 h before treatment with 10 ng/ml VEGF. Cells infected with AdGFP were visualized under a fluorescence microscope for expression of GFP to determine successful virus infection. AdHCPTP- and AdGFP-infected HUVECs in confluent monolayers were quiesced in EBM and then treated with VEGF or left untreated for 8 min. The cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.05% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm benzamidine, and 1 mm EDTA containing the protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, and leupeptin). Insoluble debris was removed from the cell lysates by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The protein extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Flk-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, C1158). The immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by 6% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody to detect VEGFR2 phosphorylation. The blots were subsequently stripped and reprobed with anti-VEGFR2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, C20) to determine equal loading. The protein extracts were also immunoprecipitated with anti-HCPTPA antibody to detect expression of the recombinant HCPTPA. To assess MAP kinase activation, 20 μg of the protein lysates was resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and incubated with anti-phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase antibody. The blots were subsequently stripped and reprobed with anti-p44/p42 MAP kinase antibody to ensure equal loading. AdHCPTP- and AdGFP-infected HUVECs were plated in 24-well plates at a density of 25,000 cells/well. After 24 h, the medium was replaced by EBM, and cells were incubated for an additional 24 h. The medium was then replaced with either fresh EBM alone or EBM containing VEGF (10 ng/ml). The cells were incubated for approximately 15 h, followed by a 3-h pulse labeling with 2 μCi/ml of [3H]thymidine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The reaction was stopped by aspirating the medium and washing the cells with Hanks' balanced salt solution (Life Technologies, Inc.). The DNA was precipitated with cold 10% trichloroacetic acid at 4 °C for 30 min, followed by an absolute ethanol wash. The precipitated material was resuspended in 0.5 ml of 0.5 m NaOH, and [3H]thymidine incorporation was determined from a 450-μl aliquot using a Beckman LS6000SC scintillation counter. Eight wells were set up for each experimental condition. The rate of migration of HUVECs was determined by using a modified Boyden chamber assay as described by Clyman et al. (19Clyman R.I. Peters K.G. Chen Y.Q. Escobedo J. Williams L.T. Ives H.E. Wilson E. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1994; 1: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, polycarbonate filter wells (Costar Transwell, 8-μm pore size) were coated with 2% gelatin in PBS for 30 min at room temperature and then incubated with DMEM containing 0.1% BSA (DMEM/BSA). AdHCPTP- and AdGFP-infected HUVECs were trypsinized, pelleted by centrifugation, and resuspended in fresh DMEM/BSA to a final concentration of 2 × 106cells/ml. Aliquots of the cells (1 × 105) were applied to the upper chamber of the filter wells. The filter inserts with cells were placed in wells of a 24-well culture plate containing either 600 μl of DMEM/BSA alone or DMEM/BSA plus 10 ng/ml VEGF. After a 4-h incubation at 37 °C, the cells that had migrated to the lower surface of the filter inserts were fixed with 10% formalin (Fisher) and stained with Harris' hematoxylin (Fisher). Six randomly selected high power (× 400) fields were counted on each filter. This assay was done as described by Nicosia et al. (15Nicosia R.F. Lin Y.J. Hazelton D. Qian X.H. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 1379-1386PubMed Google Scholar) with some modification. Thoracic aortas were excised from 2- to 3-month-old Fisher 344 female rats. Clotted blood inside the aorta was flushed with media, and periadventitial fibroadipose tissue was removed. Aortas were then cut into small cross-sectional pieces approximately 1 mm in length. Pieces of aorta were infected with adenoviruses (AdGFP or AdHCPTP) at 1 × 108 plaque-forming units in 200 μl of DMEM at room temperature for 10 min. After viral infection, one piece of aorta was placed in each well of a 48-well plate and overlaid with 150 μl of a freshly prepared fibrinogen solution (3 mg/ml) containing of ε-amino-n-caproic acid (6 μg/ml, Sigma). The fibrin gel was polymerized by the addition of 15 μl of thrombin (1 unit/ml; Sigma), for 1 to 2 h at room temperature before adding 0.5 ml of EGM plus ε-amino-n-caproic acid. The culture was maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2, changing media every other day. Rings were examined grossly each day, and digital images (× 400) were obtained for quantitative analysis of endothelial sprouts on day 8. The number of sprouts was determined by counting the number of tube-like structures originating directly from the aortic ring (exclusive of branches). Sprout length was measured from the images using a calibrated micrometer. A two-tailed Student's ttest was used to analyze statistical differences between AdGFP- and AdHCPTP-treated groups. Differences were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05. In an effort to identify signaling molecules that associate with VEGFR2, the entire intracellular region of murine VEGFR2 was used as a bait to screen a human fetal heart library in the yeast two-hybrid system. One of the clones identified in this screen encoded a small molecular weight protein tyrosine phosphatase, HCPTPA. Demonstrating the specificity of the interaction, HCPTPA interacted with Flk-1, but it did not interact with a series of unrelated baits (data not shown). Although HCPTPA contains no identifiable phosphotyrosine binding motifs, previous studies have shown that HCPTPA can associate with phosphotyrosine residues on the PDGF receptor via its catalytic domain (20Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Raugei G. Manao G. Taddei L. Ramponi G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, the HCPTPA clone encompassed the entire catalytic domain and interacted with wild-type Flk-1 but failed to interact with a bait encoding a mutated, inactive VEGFR2 kinase domain (Fig. 1). Importantly, the yeast two-hybrid system used in this study has previously been shown to be capable of detecting low affinity interactions such as enzyme-substrate interactions (21Estojak J. Brent R. Golemis E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5829-5850Crossref Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Knowing that HCPTPA associated with VEGFR2 in a phosphotyrosine-dependent manner, the next question addressed was whether or not VEGFR2 could serve as a substrate for HCPTPA. When a recombinant GST-VEGFR2 kinase domain was autophosphorylated in vitro and incubated with recombinant HCPTPA, the VEGFR2 kinase domain was dephosphorylated by HCPTPA in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2 A). Preincubation of VEGFR2 kinase domain with HCPTPA not only markedly reduced autophosphorylation (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1 and 2) but also markedly reduced the association of the VEGFR2 kinase domain with the SH2 domain of SHC, a signaling molecule known to associate with VEGFR2in vivo (Fig. 2 B, lanes 3 and 4). Although recombinant, autophosphorylated VEGFR2 kinase domain was a substrate for recombinant HCPTPA in vitro, it remained possible that the endogenous VEGFR2 would not be a substrate for HCPTPAin vivo. To illustrate the potential for an HCPTPA-VEGFR2 interaction in vivo, endogenous HCPTPA expression could be easily detected in two endothelial cell lines that also express VEGFR2 (Fig. 3 A and data not shown). In addition, as with the in vitro phosphorylated VEGFR2 kinase,in vivo phosphorylated VEGFR2 from endothelial cells was dramatically dephosphorylated after incubation with recombinant HCPTPA (Fig. 3 B). Because HCPTPA does display phosphotyrosine substrate specificity, this was an important finding since the tyrosine residues of VEGFR2 that are phosphorylated in vitro may not be the same as those phosphorylated in vivo (22Zhang M. Stauffacher C.V. Lin D. Van Etten R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21714-21720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 23Bucciantini M. Stefani M. Taddei N. Chiti F. Rigacci S. Ramponi G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). By having shown that VEGFR2, phosphorylated either in vitro orin vivo, could serve as a substrate for HCPTPA, the next question was whether or not HCPTPA was a downstream effector of VEGFR2 signaling in intact endothelial cells. To address this question, an adenoviral vector was generated to direct the overexpression of an HA-tagged HCPTPA (AdHCPTP). When used to infect cultured endothelial cells (ECRF24 cells), AdHCPTP directed easily detectable expression of HA-tagged HCPTPA (Fig. 4 A). Compared with a control adenovirus (AdGFP), AdHCPTPA induced a marked decrease in VEGF-mediated autophosphorylation of VEGFR2 (Fig. 4 A). In addition to blocking VEGFR2 autophosphorylation in ECRF24 cells, overexpression of HCPTPA blocked VEGF-mediated activation of MAP kinase in primary endothelial cells (Fig. 4 B). Moreover, overexpression of HCPTPA dramatically blunted VEGF-mediated survival/proliferation and migration in primary endothelial cells (Fig. 5, A and B). These findings demonstrate that HCPTPA may be a negative regulator of VEGFR2 activation, signaling, and biological responses.FIG. 5HCPTPA inhibits VEGF-mediated endothelial cell responses. A, overexpression of HCPTPA inhibits VEGF-induced endothelial cell mitogenesis. HUVECs were infected with the indicated adenoviral vector and subsequently were either left unstimulated or were stimulated with VEGF prior to measuring thymidine incorporation as described under “Experimental Procedures.”B, overexpression of HCPTPA inhibits VEGF-mediated endothelial cell migration. HUVECs were infected with either AdHCPTP or AdGFP as indicated, and chemotaxis was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Since overexpression of HCPTPA inhibited VEGF-mediated signaling and cellular responses in cultured endothelial cells, the next step was to determine whether overexpression of HCPTPA could inhibit angiogenesis. The rat aortic ring model recapitulates the entire process of angiogenesis and is known to be driven, at least in part, via the VEGF pathway (15Nicosia R.F. Lin Y.J. Hazelton D. Qian X.H. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 1379-1386PubMed Google Scholar, 24Nicosia R.F. Villaschi S. Lab. Invest. 1995; 73: 658-666PubMed Google Scholar, 25Nicosia R.F. Villaschi S. Smith M. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. 1994; 30: 394-399Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 26Nicosia R.F. Bonanno E. Villaschi S. Atherosclerosis. 1992; 95: 191-199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 27Nicosia R.F. Ottinetti A. Lab. Invest. 1990; 63: 115-122PubMed Google Scholar). To test the effect of overexpression of HCPTPA on angiogenesis in the rat aortic ring model, segments of rat aorta were incubated with either AdGFP or AdHCPTP and embedded in fibrin gels. After 7–10 days, it was clear that the AdGFP-infected rings demonstrated a luxuriant development of vascular sprouts (Fig. 6 A). In contrast, AdHCPTP-infected rings produced few, if any, well formed vascular sprouts (Fig. 6 B). Consistent with these gross observations, when sprout formation was quantified, infection of rat aortic rings with AdHCPTP resulted in a dramatic reduction in both the number of sprouts and the length of sprouts compared with the control AdGFP (Fig. 6, C and D). VEGF receptor signaling plays an important role in angiogenesis, a process known to be required for embryonic development and for the development and progression of many clinically important diseases. The present study demonstrates that VEGFR2 associates with, and is a substrate for, a low molecular weight protein tyrosine phosphatase, HCPTPA. Overexpression of HCPTPA in cultured endothelial cells impaired VEGFR2 activation, inhibited VEGF-mediated signal transduction, and blunted VEGF-mediated proliferation and chemotaxis. Moreover, in a VEGF-dependent model of angiogenesis, the rat aortic ring assay, overexpression of HCPTPA blocked the formation of vascular sprouts. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that HCPTPA is an important negative regulator of VEGF action. Because of this potential importance of HCPTPA in VEGF receptor function and angiogenesis, gaining insights into how its activity is regulated will be essential. Our data demonstrate that HCPTPA is constitutively expressed in endothelial cells, suggesting that its activity may be regulated by post-translational modifications. For example, tyrosine phosphorylation of HCPTPA by the Src kinase enhances its catalytic activity (28Rigacci S. Degl'Innocenti D. Bucciantini M. Cirri P. Berti A. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1278-1281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Taken in the context of the present study, this finding suggests that activation of Src, or perhaps related kinases in endothelial cells, might blunt signaling downstream of VEGF receptors. Conversely, low molecular weight protein tyrosine phosphatases such as HCPTPA can be reversibly inactivated by nitric oxide via S-nitrosylation of the active site cysteine (29Caselli A. Camici G.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Generation of nitric oxide downstream of VEGF receptor activation has been shown to be essential for the biological activities of VEGF, including mitogenesis, permeability, and angiogenesis (31Murohara T.

Res. 1996; 63: 77-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Based on these findings and our present data, it is tempting to speculate that one of the essential functions of nitric oxide generation is to transiently inhibit the activity of phosphatases such as HCPTPA to accentuate VEGFR signaling. Whether tyrosine phosphorylation and/or S-nitrosylation of HCPTPA importantly regulate VEGF signaling is currently open to speculation. However, if both translational modifications were to occur simultaneously downstream of VEGF receptor activation, one can imagine an elegant biological rheostat. Initially, inactivation of HCPTPA byS-nitrosylation would prevail. However, with the decline in nitric oxide production, reactivation of HCPTPA by endogenous reducing agents would ensue. Enhanced phosphatase activity would then catalyze the rapid dephosphorylation and inactivation of VEGF receptors as well as of the phosphatase itself (via autocatalysis (28Rigacci S. Degl'Innocenti D. Bucciantini M. Cirri P. Berti A. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1278-1281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar)). Subsequent to this series of events, phosphatases would return to their lower level of constitutive activity, perhaps to perform a maintenance function such as policing errantly activated receptors. In addition to negative regulatory properties, some protein tyrosine phosphatases, such as the SH2-containing phosphatases, have been shown to be essential components of positive signaling downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases (40Bennett A.M.

A. 1995; 92: 664-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In fact, in a recent study, association of HCPTPA was demonstrated following the formation of tetrameric, but not dimeric, complexes of endothelial Eph receptors (45Stein E. Lane A.A. Cerretti D.P. Schoecklmann H.O. Schroff A.D. Van Etten R.L. Daniel T.O. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). In that report, different cellular responses were induced by tetramericversus dimeric receptor complexes, leading to the hypothesis that ephrin receptor signaling is modulated by differential recruitment of HCPTPA. Consistent with that report, we were not able to demonstrate direct association of HCPTPA with activated VEGFR2, which should form predominantly dimeric complexes, yet overexpression of HCPTPA clearly had a negative effect on VEGF-mediated cellular responses. Considered together, these findings suggest that HCPTPA, when recruited to a dimeric complex, is catalytically active and dephosphorylates the activated receptors, thus limiting, or perhaps modulating, signal transduction. When recruited to a tetrameric complex, however, HCPTPA may be maintained in an inactive conformation, allowing prolonged rather than transient receptor activation, thus modifying the signaling output and the subsequent biological response. In addition to regulating VEGFR2, low molecular weight protein tyrosine phosphatases may regulate signal transduction downstream of other receptor tyrosine kinases. For example, HCPTP binds to PDGF receptors in a phosphotyrosine-dependent manner, and PDGF receptors are substrates for recombinant HCPTP in vitro (20Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Raugei G. Manao G. Taddei L. Ramponi G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 46Berti A. Rigacci S. Raugei G. Degl'Innocenti D. Ramponi G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In addition, overexpression of HCPTP in fibroblasts reduces PDGF receptor autophosphorylation and inhibits PDGF-stimulated mitogenic signaling (46Berti A. Rigacci S. Raugei G. Degl'Innocenti D. Ramponi G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Importantly, PDGF receptors are expressed on certain populations of endothelial cells, suggesting that endothelial HCPTPA could play an important regulatory role in multiple angiogenic signaling pathways (47Battegay E.J. Rupp J. Iruela-Arispe L. Sage E.H. Pech M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 917-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 48Fantl W.J. Peters K.G. Williams L.T. Growth Factors and Cytokines in Health and Disease. 1. Jai Press Inc., Greenwich, CT1996: 179-228Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, HCPTPA interacted with Tie2, another endothelial receptor tyrosine kinase with crucial roles during angiogenesis, in the yeast two-hybrid system. 2L. Huang and K. G. Peters, unpublished observations. Based on these data, it may be that the negative regulation of multiple angiogenic pathways in addition to the VEGF pathway contributed to the profound inhibition of angiogenesis seen in the aortic ring assay. In contrast, HCPTPA did not interact with either VEGFR1 (Flt-1) or Tie1, suggesting some specificity in the action of HCPTPA on endothelial signaling pathways. Considering the potential importance of angiogenesis in the development and progression of clinically important diseases, along with the crucial role that VEGF receptors and other receptor tyrosine kinases play in the angiogenic process, understanding the role of downstream effectors such as HCPTPA will be increasingly important. The results of this study suggest that in diseases characterized by vascular insufficiency, inhibition of HCPTPA activity might enhance revascularization. Conversely, in the myriad of diseases that are driven by the growth of new blood vessels, such as cancer, arthritis, and diabetic retinopathy, it is possible that enhancing the activity of HCPTPA will inhibit angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1982202242,"Retinoic acid (RA) regulation of cellular proliferation and differentiation is mediated, at least in part, through two related nuclear receptors, RAR and RXR. RA-induced modulation of gene expression leads generally to cellular differentiation, whereas stimulation of the protein kinase C (PKC) signaling pathway is associated with cellular proliferation. Pursuant to our discovery that prolonged activation of PKCs induced a strong decrease in RA responsiveness of a retinoid-inducible reporter gene, we have further investigated the connections between these two signaling pathways. We demonstrate that PKC isoforms α and γ are able to phosphorylate human RARα (hRARα) in vitro on a single serine residue located in the extended DNA binding domain (T box). The introduction of a negative charge at this position (serine 157) strongly decreased hRARα transcriptional activity, whereas a similar mutation at other PKC consensus phosphorylation sites had no effect. The effect on transcriptional activation was correlated with a decrease in the capacity of hRARα to heterodimerize with hRXRα. Thus hRARα is a direct target for PKCα and γ, which may control retinoid receptor transcriptional activities during cellular proliferation and differentiation.

Among them, diacylglycerol (DAG)1 and others are able to modulate cellular protein kinase C (PKC) activities needed for sustained cellular responses (1Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4215) Google Scholar, 2Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2355) Google Scholar). The PKC superfamily contains to date 11 isoforms encoded by 10 genes. The isoforms can be classified into three groups based on sequence homologies and biochemical properties: conventional PKCs (isoforms α, β1, β2, and γ) are DAG- and calcium-dependent kinases; novel PKCs (isoforms δ, ε, η, θ) are dependent only on DAG; and a third group of atypical PKCs (isoforms ξ, λ/ι) is unresponsive to DAG and calcium. The μ isoform (mouse protein kinase D) is a high molecular weight enzyme with specific properties such as a transmembrane domain, but it can be considered an atypical PKC in view of its very low affinity for DAG (for review, see Refs. 3Blobe G.C. Stribling S. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Cancer Surv. 1996; 27: 213-248PubMed Google Scholar and 4Jaken S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). All of these kinases need negatively charged phospholipids (phosphatidylserine) to exert their phosphorylating activities, triggering major cellular events such as differentiation and proliferation. Although a clear physiological role for each isozyme has not been established definitively, the existence of these isotypes with unique subcellular and tissue distribution suggests a specialized role for each isoform (for review, see Ref. 5Hofmann J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 649-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Most notably, gene transfer experiments have underlined a role of these protein kinases in cellular proliferation and tumor growth progression.Nuclear receptors are ligand-dependent transcription factors that control a wide range of cellular events, including cellular proliferation and differentiation. Several lines of evidence point to a direct role of the PKC signaling pathway in modulating the transcriptional activity of some members of this superfamily. The thyroid hormone receptor appears to be a target for PKC (6Goldberg VI, Y. Glineur C. Gesquiere J.C. Ricouart A. Sap J. Vennstrom B. Ghysdael J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2425-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) as well as the human vitamin D receptor (hVDR). hVDR is phosphorylated by PKCβ in the DNA binding domain (DBD), and phosphorylated serine (Ser-51) is important for hVDR transactivation properties (7Hsieh J.C.

Regulation of other nuclear receptors (glucocorticoid receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, estrogen receptor) through activation of the MAP kinase cascade has also been documented and suggests that PKC, as an activator of the MAP kinase pathway, might participate indirectly in the control of the transcriptional activity of these nuclear receptors (9Ueda Y.

They indicated that chronic treatment of COS-7 cells with TPA led to the specific inhibition of the activity of a retinoid-inducible reporter gene. We determined that hRARα is a substrate for PKC in vitro, and preliminary results suggested that two to four phosphorylation sites occurred out of the ligand binding domain (LBD) of this nuclear receptor (14Tahayato A. Lefebvre P. Formstecher P. Dautrevaux M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1642-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In light of these results, we addressed in this study several questions to elucidate further the role of PKC isozymes in the regulation of the transcriptional activity of hRARα. We characterized PKC isoforms for their capacity to phosphorylate hRARα in vitro and identified the target amino acid. Mutation of the phosphorylated serine affected hRARα transcriptional activity, and the molecular basis for the observed inhibition was investigated. Our results support the hypothesis that PKCα and PKCγ are direct regulators of hRARα transcriptional activity by altering its ability to dimerize with RXRs.DISCUSSIONModulation of the phosphorylation state plays an important role in the reversible control of the activity of many proteins, including nuclear receptors. In the case of hRARα1, heterodimerization properties have been shown to be altered by protein phosphatases 1 and 2A (15Lefebvre P. Gaub M.P. Tahayato A. Rochette-Egly C. Formstecher P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10806-10816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and the NH2-terminal function AF-1 to be activated through the proline-directed Cdk7 (27Rochette-Egly C. Adam S. Rossignol M. Egly J.M. Chambon P. Cell. 1997; 90: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). We now show that dimerization of hRARα with hRXRα can be modulated by PKC-dependent phosphorylation. Several potential phosphorylation sites by PKCs are located along the hRARα sequence. Phosphopeptide mapping studies as well as mutagenesis of hRARα identified Ser-157 as the major target for PKCα and PKCγ isoforms (Figs. 2 and 3). This amino acid is located in the T box of hRARα, which, together with the A box, are part of a larger region (hinge domain) that is organized into an α-helical structure in the RXR·T3R DBD dimer (23Rastinejad F. Perlmann T. Evans R.M. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1995; 375: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Molecular modeling of RXR·RAR dimers suggested that the T box, forming a loop interrupted by an α-helical turn perpendicular to the DNA axis, engages dimerization contacts with the RXR DBD. Interestingly, Ser-157 neighbors amino acids that, in RXR·T3R and RXR·VDR dimer structures, establish salt bridges with the RXR DBD (Asp-69 and Glu-69, respectively). Thus phosphorylation of Ser-157 may introduce strong conformational constraints on this dimerization region and, as observed, decrease the relative affinity of RAR DBD for RXR DBD and inhibit dimerization. Alternatively, phosphorylation of Ser-157 may perturb the relative orientation of RAR DBD and LBD as suggested for VDR (24Quack M. Szafranski K. Rouvinen J. Carlberg C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5372-5378Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and in turn modify the orientation of the strong dimerization interface located in the hRARα LBD (8Hsieh J.C. Jurutka P.W. Nakajima S. Galligan M.A. Haussler C.A. Shimizu Y. Shimizu N. Whitfield G.K. Haussler M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15118-15126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein kinases C are a family of Ser/Thr kinases whose activities are involved in the regulation of complex biological responses such as differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. They are organized in two domains, a COOH-terminal catalytic domain and an NH2 -terminal regulatory domain. Their tissue distribution is in most cases ubiquitous, with the exception of PKCγ, which is expressed specifically in the brain and spinal cord. Response to agonists (hormones, neurotransmitters, growth factors) is mediated through a transient short term production of DAG, essentially through phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis. A more sustained response may be observed with phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis or phorbol ester treatment. The basic model of PKC activation suggests that PKC translocation to the plasma membrane is the main event regulating this signaling cascade. However, PKC is often found, irrespective of its activation state, in the particulate fraction (membranes, organelles, and nuclei) of cultured cells and in nuclei themselves. HeLa cells were found to express α, γ, ι, μ, λ, and ζ isozymes, among which α and γ isozymes appeared to be sensitive to TPA-induced down-regulation.3 Both PKCα and γ can be found in nuclei of HeLa cells.3 A prolonged activation of PKCs by phorbol esters or repeated DAG stimulation leads to cellular depletion in PKCs by inducing a high rate of proteolytic clipping of DAG-dependent kinases, concomitantly with the nuclear translocation of the catalytic domain (PKM), which displays unregulated kinase activity (28James G. Olson E.N. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 863-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We observed that the catalytic domain of PKCα and γ (PKM) was almost exclusively nuclear and that PKM accumulated in nuclei upon TPA treatment, to reach a 3–5-fold higher concentration than in control cells.3 However, this treatment, much like PKCα overexpression, also led to strong alteration of the cellular morphology as well as perturbation of the cell cycle, and therefore made a direct correlation between PKC activation/translocation and hRARα inhibition very difficult to establish. However, in these types of experiments, S157A displayed a very low sensitivity to TPA treatment, in opposition to wt hRARα.3 Several nuclear proteins are potential or known substrates for PKCs: LIM-containing proteins (29Kuroda S.

RAR-mediated transactivation has also been reported to be strongly potentiated by short term phorbol ester treatment in T cells (34Yang Y.L. Minucci S. Zand D.J. Ozato K. Ashwell J.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1370-1376PubMed Google Scholar). However, similar experiments carried out in HeLa cells demonstrated a strong inhibition of the atRA-induced transcriptional response, in agreement with the proposed inhibition of the retinoid pathway by the AP-1 signaling module. 4M.-H. Delmotte, M. Benkoussa, and P. Lefebvre, unpublished data. It is therefore likely that the reported potentiation arises from an AP-1 independent, cell-type specific indirect mechanism.atRA has been described as an effector able to modulate PKC isozymes expression (35Khuri F.R.

Physiol. 1997; 172: 306-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, our data neither provided evidence for significant variation of PKC isoform content in atRA-treated cells, nor we were able to document alteration of the cellular partitioning of expressed intact isoforms by indirect immunofluorescence.3This set of data clearly suggests that interferences between the PKC and retinoid signaling pathways are cell-specific and diverse and that, in this respect, one must distinguish between short term events (AP-1 induction, PKC activation) and long term events (alteration of PKC expression rate). Short term TPA treatment of HeLa cells may activate several signaling pathways involving PKCs, MAP kinases, and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK). PKC down-regulation has been reported to block completely JNK activation by phorbol esters in HeLa cells (41Werlen G. Jacinto E. Xia Y. Karin M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3101-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), and MAP kinase overexpression in COS cells did not modify the phosphorylation pattern of hRARα (27Rochette-Egly C. Adam S. Rossignol M. Egly J.M. Chambon P. Cell. 1997; 90: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). No increase in MAP kinase activity was detected in TPA-treated HeLa cells,3 thus ruling out a potential involvement of these two protein kinases in the observed inactivation of hRARα.Furthermore, additional cross-talk processes can be also considered based on the nongenomic effects of steroid and of others ligands for nuclear receptors. For example, vitamin D3 has been shown to activate the MAP kinase signaling cascade through activation of PKC (42Beno D.W.A. Brady L.M. Bissonnette M. Davis B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3642-3647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and is able to induce subcellular redistribution of calcium-dependent PKCs. Tamoxifen, a therapeutic/chemopreventive nonsteroidal antagonist of estrogen receptor, induces PKC translocation to the membrane and down-regulation of this enzyme through oxidative stress (43Gundimeda U. Chen Z.H. Gopalakrishna R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13504-13514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Finally, retinoids, estrogens, and vitamin D3 treatment of cells modulate the rate of expression of PKC isoforms (26Simboli-Campbell M. Gagnon A. Franks D.J. Welsh J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3257-3264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Marino M. Pallottini V. Trentalance A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 1993; 268: 25132-25138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), underlining a complex network of intertwined, and often antagonistic, signaling pathways eventually controlling cell differentiation, growth, and death.In conclusion, our findings establish that PKC isoforms are able to phosphorylate hRARα and control its dimerization properties, very likely through T box conformational alteration. The observed inhibition may be of importance in differentiation and proliferation processes during which sustained activation of PKCs is necessary to induce a full biological response to external stimuli. External stimuli (neurotransmitters, hormones, mitogens) activating G-protein-coupled receptors and growth factor receptors induce the activity of phospholipases, which in turn generate membrane lipid metabolites. Among them, diacylglycerol (DAG)1 and others are able to modulate cellular protein kinase C (PKC) activities needed for sustained cellular responses (1Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4215) Google Scholar, 2Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2355) Google Scholar). The PKC superfamily contains to date 11 isoforms encoded by 10 genes. The isoforms can be classified into three groups based on sequence homologies and biochemical properties: conventional PKCs (isoforms α, β1, β2, and γ) are DAG- and calcium-dependent kinases; novel PKCs (isoforms δ, ε, η, θ) are dependent only on DAG; and a third group of atypical PKCs (isoforms ξ, λ/ι) is unresponsive to DAG and calcium. The μ isoform (mouse protein kinase D) is a high molecular weight enzyme with specific properties such as a transmembrane domain, but it can be considered an atypical PKC in view of its very low affinity for DAG (for review, see Refs. 3Blobe G.C. Stribling S. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Cancer Surv. 1996; 27: 213-248PubMed Google Scholar and 4Jaken S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). All of these kinases need negatively charged phospholipids (phosphatidylserine) to exert their phosphorylating activities, triggering major cellular events such as differentiation and proliferation. Although a clear physiological role for each isozyme has not been established definitively, the existence of these isotypes with unique subcellular and tissue distribution suggests a specialized role for each isoform (for review, see Ref. 5Hofmann J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 649-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Most notably, gene transfer experiments have underlined a role of these protein kinases in cellular proliferation and tumor growth progression. Nuclear receptors are ligand-dependent transcription factors that control a wide range of cellular events, including cellular proliferation and differentiation. Several lines of evidence point to a direct role of the PKC signaling pathway in modulating the transcriptional activity of some members of this superfamily. The thyroid hormone receptor appears to be a target for PKC (6Goldberg VI, Y. Glineur C. Gesquiere J.C. Ricouart A. Sap J. Vennstrom B. Ghysdael J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2425-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) as well as the human vitamin D receptor (hVDR). hVDR is phosphorylated by PKCβ in the DNA binding domain (DBD), and phosphorylated serine (Ser-51) is important for hVDR transactivation properties (7Hsieh J.C. Jurutka P.W. Galligan M.A. Terpening C.M. Haussler C.A. Samuels D.S. Shimizu Y. Shimizu N. Haussler M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1993; 268: 15118-15126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Regulation of other nuclear receptors (glucocorticoid receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, estrogen receptor) through activation of the MAP kinase cascade has also been documented and suggests that PKC, as an activator of the MAP kinase pathway, might participate indirectly in the control of the transcriptional activity of these nuclear receptors (9Ueda Y.

Our previous experiments pointed to a role of PKC in the regulation of hRARα transcriptional activity. They indicated that chronic treatment of COS-7 cells with TPA led to the specific inhibition of the activity of a retinoid-inducible reporter gene. We determined that hRARα is a substrate for PKC in vitro, and preliminary results suggested that two to four phosphorylation sites occurred out of the ligand binding domain (LBD) of this nuclear receptor (14Tahayato A. Lefebvre P. Formstecher P. Dautrevaux M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1642-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In light of these results, we addressed in this study several questions to elucidate further the role of PKC isozymes in the regulation of the transcriptional activity of hRARα. We characterized PKC isoforms for their capacity to phosphorylate hRARα in vitro and identified the target amino acid. Mutation of the phosphorylated serine affected hRARα transcriptional activity, and the molecular basis for the observed inhibition was investigated. Our results support the hypothesis that PKCα and PKCγ are direct regulators of hRARα transcriptional activity by altering its ability to dimerize with RXRs. DISCUSSIONModulation of the phosphorylation state plays an important role in the reversible control of the activity of many proteins, including nuclear receptors. In the case of hRARα1, heterodimerization properties have been shown to be altered by protein phosphatases 1 and 2A (15Lefebvre P. Gaub M.P. Tahayato A. Rochette-Egly C. Formstecher P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10806-10816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and the NH2-terminal function AF-1 to be activated through the proline-directed Cdk7 (27Rochette-Egly C. Adam S. Rossignol M. Egly J.M. Chambon P. Cell. 1997; 90: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). We now show that dimerization of hRARα with hRXRα can be modulated by PKC-dependent phosphorylation. Several potential phosphorylation sites by PKCs are located along the hRARα sequence. Phosphopeptide mapping studies as well as mutagenesis of hRARα identified Ser-157 as the major target for PKCα and PKCγ isoforms (Figs. 2 and 3). This amino acid is located in the T box of hRARα, which, together with the A box, are part of a larger region (hinge domain) that is organized into an α-helical structure in the RXR·T3R DBD dimer (23Rastinejad F. Perlmann T. Evans R.M. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1995; 375: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Molecular modeling of RXR·RAR dimers suggested that the T box, forming a loop interrupted by an α-helical turn perpendicular to the DNA axis, engages dimerization contacts with the RXR DBD. Interestingly, Ser-157 neighbors amino acids that, in RXR·T3R and RXR·VDR dimer structures, establish salt bridges with the RXR DBD (Asp-69 and Glu-69, respectively). Thus phosphorylation of Ser-157 may introduce strong conformational constraints on this dimerization region and, as observed, decrease the relative affinity of RAR DBD for RXR DBD and inhibit dimerization. Alternatively, phosphorylation of Ser-157 may perturb the relative orientation of RAR DBD and LBD as suggested for VDR (24Quack M. Szafranski K. Rouvinen J. Carlberg C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5372-5378Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and in turn modify the orientation of the strong dimerization interface located in the hRARα LBD (8Hsieh J.C. Jurutka P.W. Nakajima S. Galligan M.A. Haussler C.A. Shimizu Y. Shimizu N. Whitfield G.K. Haussler M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15118-15126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein kinases C are a family of Ser/Thr kinases whose activities are involved in the regulation of complex biological responses such as differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. They are organized in two domains, a COOH-terminal catalytic domain and an NH2 -terminal regulatory domain. Their tissue distribution is in most cases ubiquitous, with the exception of PKCγ, which is expressed specifically in the brain and spinal cord. Response to agonists (hormones, neurotransmitters, growth factors) is mediated through a transient short term production of DAG, essentially through phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis. A more sustained response may be observed with phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis or phorbol ester treatment. The basic model of PKC activation suggests that PKC translocation to the plasma membrane is the main event regulating this signaling cascade. However, PKC is often found, irrespective of its activation state, in the particulate fraction (membranes, organelles, and nuclei) of cultured cells and in nuclei themselves. HeLa cells were found to express α, γ, ι, μ, λ, and ζ isozymes, among which α and γ isozymes appeared to be sensitive to TPA-induced down-regulation.3 Both PKCα and γ can be found in nuclei of HeLa cells.3 A prolonged activation of PKCs by phorbol esters or repeated DAG stimulation leads to cellular depletion in PKCs by inducing a high rate of proteolytic clipping of DAG-dependent kinases, concomitantly with the nuclear translocation of the catalytic domain (PKM), which displays unregulated kinase activity (28James G. Olson E.N. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 863-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We observed that the catalytic domain of PKCα and γ (PKM) was almost exclusively nuclear and that PKM accumulated in nuclei upon TPA treatment, to reach a 3–5-fold higher concentration than in control cells.3 However, this treatment, much like PKCα overexpression, also led to strong alteration of the cellular morphology as well as perturbation of the cell cycle, and therefore made a direct correlation between PKC activation/translocation and hRARα inhibition very difficult to establish. However, in these types of experiments, S157A displayed a very low sensitivity to TPA treatment, in opposition to wt hRARα.3 Several nuclear proteins are potential or known substrates for PKCs: LIM-containing proteins (29Kuroda S.

However, our data neither provided evidence for significant variation of PKC isoform content in atRA-treated cells, nor we were able to document alteration of the cellular partitioning of expressed intact isoforms by indirect immunofluorescence.3This set of data clearly suggests that interferences between the PKC and retinoid signaling pathways are cell-specific and diverse and that, in this respect, one must distinguish between short term events (AP-1 induction, PKC activation) and long term events (alteration of PKC expression rate). Short term TPA treatment of HeLa cells may activate several signaling pathways involving PKCs, MAP kinases, and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK). PKC down-regulation has been reported to block completely JNK activation by phorbol esters in HeLa cells (41Werlen G. Jacinto E. Xia Y. Karin M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3101-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), and MAP kinase overexpression in COS cells did not modify the phosphorylation pattern of hRARα (27Rochette-Egly C. Adam S. Rossignol M. Egly J.M. Chambon P. Cell. 1997; 90: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). No increase in MAP kinase activity was detected in TPA-treated HeLa cells,3 thus ruling out a potential involvement of these two protein kinases in the observed inactivation of hRARα.Furthermore, additional cross-talk processes can be also considered based on the nongenomic effects of steroid and of others ligands for nuclear receptors. For example, vitamin D3 has been shown to activate the MAP kinase signaling cascade through activation of PKC (42Beno D.W.A. Brady L.M. Bissonnette M. Davis B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3642-3647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and is able to induce subcellular redistribution of calcium-dependent PKCs. Tamoxifen, a therapeutic/chemopreventive nonsteroidal antagonist of estrogen receptor, induces PKC translocation to the membrane and down-regulation of this enzyme through oxidative stress (43Gundimeda U. Chen Z.H. Gopalakrishna R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13504-13514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Finally, retinoids, estrogens, and vitamin D3 treatment of cells modulate the rate of expression of PKC isoforms (26Simboli-Campbell M. Gagnon A. Franks D.J. Welsh J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3257-3264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Marino M. Pallottini V. Trentalance A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 1993; 268: 25132-25138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), underlining a complex network of intertwined, and often antagonistic, signaling pathways eventually controlling cell differentiation, growth, and death.In conclusion, our findings establish that PKC isoforms are able to phosphorylate hRARα and control its dimerization properties, very likely through T box conformational alteration. The observed inhibition may be of importance in differentiation and proliferation processes during which sustained activation of PKCs is necessary to induce a full biological response to external stimuli. Modulation of the phosphorylation state plays an important role in the reversible control of the activity of many proteins, including nuclear receptors. In the case of hRARα1, heterodimerization properties have been shown to be altered by protein phosphatases 1 and 2A (15Lefebvre P. Gaub M.P. Tahayato A. Rochette-Egly C. Formstecher P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10806-10816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and the NH2-terminal function AF-1 to be activated through the proline-directed Cdk7 (27Rochette-Egly C. Adam S. Rossignol M. Egly J.M. Chambon P. Cell. 1997; 90: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). We now show that dimerization of hRARα with hRXRα can be modulated by PKC-dependent phosphorylation. Several potential phosphorylation sites by PKCs are located along the hRARα sequence. Phosphopeptide mapping studies as well as mutagenesis of hRARα identified Ser-157 as the major target for PKCα and PKCγ isoforms (Figs. 2 and 3). This amino acid is located in the T box of hRARα, which, together with the A box, are part of a larger region (hinge domain) that is organized into an α-helical structure in the RXR·T3R DBD dimer (23Rastinejad F. Perlmann T. Evans R.M. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1995; 375: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Molecular modeling of RXR·RAR dimers suggested that the T box, forming a loop interrupted by an α-helical turn perpendicular to the DNA axis, engages dimerization contacts with the RXR DBD. Interestingly, Ser-157 neighbors amino acids that, in RXR·T3R and RXR·VDR dimer structures, establish salt bridges with the RXR DBD (Asp-69 and Glu-69, respectively). Thus phosphorylation of Ser-157 may introduce strong conformational constraints on this dimerization region and, as observed, decrease the relative affinity of RAR DBD for RXR DBD and inhibit dimerization. Alternatively, phosphorylation of Ser-157 may perturb the relative orientation of RAR DBD and LBD as suggested for VDR (24Quack M. Szafranski K. Rouvinen J. Carlberg C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5372-5378Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and in turn modify the orientation of the strong dimerization interface located in the hRARα LBD (8Hsieh J.C. Jurutka P.W. Nakajima S. Galligan M.A. Haussler C.A. Shimizu Y. Shimizu N. Whitfield G.K. Haussler M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15118-15126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein kinases C are a family of Ser/Thr kinases whose activities are involved in the regulation of complex biological responses such as differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. They are organized in two domains, a COOH-terminal catalytic domain and an NH2 -terminal regulatory domain. Their tissue distribution is in most cases ubiquitous, with the exception of PKCγ, which is expressed specifically in the brain and spinal cord. Response to agonists (hormones, neurotransmitters, growth factors) is mediated through a transient short term production of DAG, essentially through phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis. A more sustained response may be observed with phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis or phorbol ester treatment. The basic model of PKC activation suggests that PKC translocation to the plasma membrane is the main event regulating this signaling cascade. However, PKC is often found, irrespective of its activation state, in the particulate fraction (membranes, organelles, and nuclei) of cultured cells and in nuclei themselves. HeLa cells were found to express α, γ, ι, μ, λ, and ζ isozymes, among which α and γ isozymes appeared to be sensitive to TPA-induced down-regulation.3 Both PKCα and γ can be found in nuclei of HeLa cells.3 A prolonged activation of PKCs by phorbol esters or repeated DAG stimulation leads to cellular depletion in PKCs by inducing a high rate of proteolytic clipping of DAG-dependent kinases, concomitantly with the nuclear translocation of the catalytic domain (PKM), which displays unregulated kinase activity (28James G. Olson E.N. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 863-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We observed that the catalytic domain of PKCα and γ (PKM) was almost exclusively nuclear and that PKM accumulated in nuclei upon TPA treatment, to reach a 3–5-fold higher concentration than in control cells.3 However, this treatment, much like PKCα overexpression, also led to strong alteration of the cellular morphology as well as perturbation of the cell cycle, and therefore made a direct correlation between PKC activation/translocation and hRARα inhibition very difficult to establish. However, in these types of experiments, S157A displayed a very low sensitivity to TPA treatment, in opposition to wt hRARα.3 Several nuclear proteins are potential or known substrates for PKCs: LIM-containing proteins (29Kuroda S.

RAR-mediated transactivation has also been reported to be strongly potentiated by short term phorbol ester treatment in T cells (34Yang Y.L. Minucci S. Zand D.J. Ozato K. Ashwell J.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1370-1376PubMed Google Scholar). However, similar experiments carried out in HeLa cells demonstrated a strong inhibition of the atRA-induced transcriptional response, in agreement with the proposed inhibition of the retinoid pathway by the AP-1 signaling module. 4M.-H. Delmotte, M. Benkoussa, and P. Lefebvre, unpublished data. It is therefore likely that the reported potentiation arises from an AP-1 independent, cell-type specific indirect mechanism. atRA has been described as an effector able to modulate PKC isozymes expression (35Khuri F.R.

Cell. 1988; 53: 45-53Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar) generated a nonsecretable 26-kDa transmembrane TNFα Δ1–12 mutant (tm TNFα). This human tm TNFα mutant is capable of lysing TNFα-sensitive target cells (20Perez C. Albert I. DeFay K. Zachariades N. Gooding L. Kriegler M.

Indications for distinct roles of transmembrane and secreted TNFαin vivo have been recently obtained in transgenic mice and by the use of inhibitors of TACE inhibitors. Mice overexpressing murine tm TNFα are prone to developing arthritis (22Alexopoulou L. Pasparakis M. Kollias G. Eur. J.

The inhibition of proteolytic TNFα cleavage by TACE inhibitors, however, protected mice completely from endotoxic shock (24Mohler K.M. Sleath P.R. Fitzner J.N. Cerretti D.P. Alderson M. Kerwar S.S.

These results clearly indicate that the pleiotropic effects of TNFα in vivo may be further subdivided into effects mediated primarily by secreted, trimeric TNFα, and tm TNFα. To further dissect the functions exerted by secreted and transmembrane TNFα and to assess the possible use of TACE inhibitors in modulating the potentially deleterious effects of secreted TNFα while maintaining the tm TNFα-mediated functions, we generated tm TNFα tg mice. To this end, the three known proteolytic cleavage sites of mouse TNFα were first inactivated by mutating the corresponding DNA sequences. The functionality of these mutants was first tested by transfecting NIH-3T3 fibroblasts and a mouse T cell hybridoma. Identical mutations were subsequently introduced into a genomic clone of mouse TNFα. The resulting transmembrane TNFα transgene is controlled by the mouse TNFα promotor, and the 3′ AU-rich elements of the genomic TNFα locus are preserved to assure adequate gene regulation in vivo (25Shaw G.

In contrast to wt TNF mice, these tm TNFα tg mice are protected from LPS +d-galactosamine-induced mortality, and no TNFα bioactivity is found in the serum of these challenged mice. Interestingly, in the absence of secreted TNFα, in vivostimulation of tm TNFα tg mice with LPS (100 μg/mouse) leads to significantly increased IL-12 serum levels when compared with wt TNF mice, thus demonstrating quantitatively distinct effects mediated by transmembrane TNFα in vivo in the absence and presence of secreted TNFα.

To construct the mouse TNFα cDNA mutants, the 1108-base pairEcoRI fragment of the TNFα cDNA (kindly provided by Genentech Inc, South San Francisco, CA) was subcloned into theEcoRI site of M13mp18. DNA sequences encoding amino acids Leu−2 to Leu+1, Leu−12 to Leu−10, and Leu−2 to Leu+1/Leu−12 to Leu−10 were deleted using the U-DNA mutagenesis kit from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and the resulting EcoRI fragments were isolated and cloned into the EcoRI site of vector pBluescript KS+. Subsequently, 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions were trimmed off by PCR-mediated linker addition using Deep Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs). The resulting TNFα cDNA genes wt TNFα, L1 TNFα (Δ[Leu−2 to Leu+1]), L2 TNFα (Δ[Leu−12 to Leu−10]), and L3 TNFα (Δ[Leu−2 to Leu+1/Leu−12 to Leu−10]) were cloned into theXhoI/NotI site of the eukaryotic expression vector BCMGS-Neo (27Karasuyama H. Melchers F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1988; 18: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar) under the control of the constitutive cytomegalovirus promoter. Using the U-DNA Mutagenesis Phasmid set (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), an additional TNFα mutant L6 was constructed by mutating Lys+11 of mutant L3 to Glu+11. Sequences of TNFα cDNA genes were verified by the dideoxy chain termination method using Sequenase® 2.0 (United States Biochemical Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions for sequencing double strand DNA. Adherent cell lines L929 and NIH-3T3 (obtained from Giuseppe Bertoni, Veterinary Hospital, Bern, Switzerland) as well as the nonadherent By155.16 T cell hybridoma (28Sleckman B.P. Peterson A. Jones W.K. Foran J.A. Greenstein J.L. Seed B. Burakoff S.J. Nature. 1987; 328: 351-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar); kindly provided by G. Hollönder, Boston, MA) were grown in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and 4 mml-glutamine. By155.16 and NIH-3T3 transfectants were selected and maintained at 500 μg/ml and 750 g/ml G418 sulfate (Life Technologies, Inc.), respectively. Transfection of NIH-3T3 and By155.16 cells with various TNFα expression constructs was accomplished by electroporation. Typically, log phase NIH-3T3 cells were intensively washed in sucrose buffer, and 5 × 106 cells in 0.8 ml of ice-cold sucrose buffer were electroporated with 5 μg of plasmid in a 0.4-cm-gap cuvette (Bio-Rad) at 1000 V and 1 uF, applying four pulses separated by 1-min intervals on ice. Electroporated cells remained for an additional 10 min on ice before being transferred into supplemented Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium. Three days later, the selection of transfectants was performed using G418 sulfate at 750 μg/ml. Resistant colonies were expanded in supplemented Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium in the presence of G418 sulfate. Electroporation of By155.16 cells was performed as described above except that only three pulses were applied. One day after electroporation, 500 μg/ml G418 sulfate was added to the medium to select for transfectants. TNFα-expressing By155.16 cells were finally enriched by sorting brightly fluorescent cells on a FACS Vantage using serum from mice transgenic for soluble TNFR p55-human Fcγ3 fusion protein (9Hunger R.E. Muller S. Laissue J.A. Hess M.W. Carnaud C. Garcia I. Mueller C. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 954-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) as a primary reagent, and FITC-conjugated F(ab′)2 rabbit anti-human IgG as a secondary reagent (Dako, Copenhagen, Denmark) for detection. Biologically active TNFα in the supernatant was detected using the TNF-sensitive L929 fibroblast bioassay as described (29Wahl S.M. Dougherty S.F. Coligan J.E. Kruisbeek A.M. Margulies D.H. Shevach E.M. Strober W. Current Protocols in Immunology. 1. Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993: 6.10.1-6.11.6Google Scholar). As a specificity control, a neutralizing polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse TNFα antibody (IP-400; Genzyme) was added to the L929-containing wells together with cell culture supernatants or TNFα producing cells. Where required, purification of TNFα from the medium was accomplished by ammonium sulfate precipitation (30Englard S. Seifter S. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 285-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Total proteins in culture supernatants were precipitated at 85% saturation of ammonium sulfate, and the protein pellet was extracted twice with 40% saturated ammonium sulfate and 50 mm Tris, pH 7.8. Finally, TNFα in the remaining protein pellet was redissolved in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, and used for Western blot analysis. Using this purification scheme we were able to quantitatively isolate TNF from the medium and to reduce more than 80% of bovine serum albumin added to supplement the culture medium. Membrane-associated TNF was prepared by lysing TNF transfectants in 0.5% Triton X-100, 300 mm NaCl, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, in the presence of a mixture of protease inhibitors including 1 mmbenzamidine, Trasylol (]1/200] vol), 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm Pefabloc (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 1.8 mg/ml iodoacetamide. At this point, samples were analyzed by Western blotting. Protein samples were concentrated by chloroform/methanol extraction (31Wessel D. Flugge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3108) Google Scholar) and electrophoretically separated on 12% polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions. Electroblotting to 0.2 μm nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell, Inc.) was carried out using a Trans-Blot electrophoretic blotting system (Idea Scientific Co.). After blocking the filters overnight in 3% bovine serum albumin, the immunoblots were developed with rabbit anti-murine TNFα antibody (Genzyme IP-400) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (Dako). 3,3′-Diaminobenzidine was used as the chromogenic substrate (Sigma). bEnd.5 endothelioma cells (32Williams R.L. Risau W. Zerwes H.G. Drexler H. Aguzzi A. Wagner E.F. Cell. 1989; 57: 1053-1063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Dr. Y. Reiss, Max-PIank-Institut, Bad Nauheim, Germany) (passages 16–18) were cultured in six-well plates. 1 × 105By155.16 T hybridoma cells transfected with BCMGS-Neo (mock control), BCMGS-wt TNFα, or BCMGS-L6 (tm TNFα) were added to semiconfluent bEnd.5 cells and co-cultured for additional 24 h. Stainings for VCAM-1 expression were done on ice in the culture wells: after extensive washing and removal of By155.16 transfectants, cells were first incubated with G4.2 (anti-CD16/32) hybridoma supernatant followed by anti-VCAM-1 monoclonal antibody (Pharmingen) and anti-rat-PE (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc). Stained bEnd.5 cells were detached by incubation with 5 mm EDTA (without Mg2+ and Ca2+) at 4 °C and were subsequently analyzed on a FACScan using Cellquest software (Becton Dickinson) for data acquisition and analysis. The genomic mutant encoding noncleavable transmembrane TNFα was constructed by the overlapping extension method (33Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar) employing the following primers (Microsynth, Balgach, Switzerland): muTNF1 (encompassing NarI at position 4448 of clone Y00467), catacccaaggcgccacatctccc; muTNF2 (deletion of Leu−12 to Leu−10), gtctgggccatagaactgatgccatttgggaac; muTNF3 (deletion of Leu−2 to Leu+1, partially overlapping muTNF2), atcagttctatggcccagaccagtaagtgttccc; muTNF4 (mutation of Lys+11 to Glu+11), cgtgggctacaggctcgtcactcg; muTNF5 (complementary to muTNF4), cgagtgacgagcctgtagcccacg; and muTNF6 (encompassing AvaI at position 5658 of clone Y00467), gctatgaggtcccgggtggccccc. An Asp718/SalI fragment of a murine genomic clone of LTα/TNFα locus (34Semon D. Kawashima E. Jongeneel C.V. Shakhov A.N. Nedospasov S.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 9083-9084Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) was subcloned into pBluescript KS+ via the flanking Asp718 and SalI sites. This plasmid, pTNF A/S, was used as template for the generation of mutated fragments A, B, and C by PCR amplification using primer pairs muTNF1/muTNF2, muTNF3/muTNF4, and muTNF5/muTNF6, respectively. Prior to further use, PCR fragments were treated with mung bean nuclease and purified by gel excision and phenol extraction. Due to their complementary ends, fragments B and C were then annealed and linked in a conventional PCR containing primers muTNF3 and muTNF6. Fragment A was subsequently linked by PCR to the fragment BC using the primers muTNF1 and muTNF6. The resulting NarI/AvaI PCR fragment carrying the deletions and point mutation was finally used to replace the NarI/AvaI wild-type fragment in pTNF A/S, thus yielding pmutgenTNF12. Reintroduction of a 1.5-kilobase pairAvaI fragment from pTNF A/S into pmutgenTNF12 at the respective site delivered pmutgenTNF13, a full-size mutant TNFα gene, which should lead to uncleavable TNFα expression. All mutations were verified by DNA sequencing using Sequenase® 2.0 (United States Biochemical Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A 4.842-kilobase Asp718/SalI fragment from pmutgenTNF13 containing the mutated genomic clone of TNFα was isolated and used to generate transgenic mice. The microinjection of about 1–2 pl buffer into the male pronucleus of TNFα/LTα double deficient C57Bl/6 × 129 mice (TNF−/− mice) (35Eugster H.-P. Müller M. Karrer U. Car B.D. Schnyder B. Eng V.M. Woerly G. Le Hir M. di Padova F. Aguet M. Zinkernagel R. Bluethmann H. Ryffel B. Int. Immunol. 1996; 8: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) was performed by standard procedures with a final DNA concentration of 2 ng/μl. Detection of transgenic mice was carried out by PCR on mouse tail DNA using the primer pair muTNFtg1 (aagttcccaaatggcatcag) and muTNFtg2 (ctacgacgtgggctacag), allowing the amplification of the transgene only. B6 × 129 mice, TNF −/− B6 × 129 mice, and tm TNFα tg TNF−/− B6 × 129 mice were challenged with intraperitoneal administration of 10 μg of LPS + 20 mg ofd-galactosamine. Mice were observed for 72 h. Mice were sacrificed when they became moribund or at the end of the observation period, i.e. 72 h after LPS +d-galactosamine administration. A 1108-base pair cDNA fragment of the murine TNFα gene (positions 1–1108; obtained from Genentech Inc., San Francisco, CA) was subcloned into pGEM-2. After linearization of the plasmid, sense and antisense RNA probes were prepared using the appropriate RNA-polymerase as described previously (36Mueller C. Gershenfeld H.K. Lobe C.G. Okada C.Y. Bleackley R.C. Weissman I.L. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 167: 1124-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In situ hybridizations of paraformaldehyde-fixed cryostat sections were performed as described previously (36Mueller C. Gershenfeld H.K. Lobe C.G. Okada C.Y. Bleackley R.C. Weissman I.L. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 167: 1124-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). After osmotic lysis of erythrocytes, splenocytes were incubated with 0.5–1 μg of biotinylated anti-CD8α and anti-B220 monoclonal antibody per 106 cells for 15 min on ice. Avidin magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) were used as second step reagents for the negative selection of CD4 T cells. The CD4 T cell-enriched negative fraction (90% purity) was resuspended at 2 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI medium + 10% fetal calf serum in the presence of 3 × 106 cells/ml of irradiated antigen-presenting cells (2000 rad) and was incubated with 2 μg/ml concanavalin A for 48 h. After 2 days, the cells were washed and incubated for additional 72 h in the presence of 100 units/ml IL-2. The CD4 T cell blasts were then purified on a Ficoll gradient, and 2 × 106 cells/ml were incubated for 4 h in the presence of 50 units/ml IL-2, 20 μg/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and 200 μg/ml ionomycin and subsequently co-cultured with L929 cells. Mice were sacrificed 3 and 6 h after intraperitoneal administration of 100 μg of LPS, and serum was collected for subsequent determination of IL-12 p70 levels. IL-12 p70 was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 96-well microtiter plates using the anti-IL-12 p70 monoclonal antibody 9A5 as a coating antibody and biotinylated and IL-12 p40 monoclonal antibody C17.8 as a detecting antibody. The standard curve was constructed using recombinant mouse IL-12 p70 (all reagents from Pharmingen). For statistical analysis and calculation of P values, the Student t test was performed using InStat version 2.03 software (GraphPad Inc). For the detection of TNFα in the serum, mice were sacrificed 1.5 h after administration of 100 μg of LPS, intraperitoneal and the serum was collected for subsequent assessment of bioactive TNFα using L929 indicator cells. To assess the differential proteolytic cleavage of mouse TNFα, the three known proteolytic cleavage sites of mouse TNFα (17Cseh K. Beutler B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16256-16260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,18Decoster E. Vanhaesebroeck B. Vandenabeele P. Grooten J. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18473-18478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) were sequentially deleted in a mouse TNFα cDNA clone. To this end, four different mutants of mouse TNFα cDNA were created, with inactivation of the cleavage sites at positions +1 (TNFα mutant L1); −10 (TNFα mutant L2); +1 and −10 (TNFα mutant L3) and +1, −10, and +11 (TNFα mutant L6) (Fig. 1). Mutant cDNAs were subsequently cloned into the BCMGS-Neo expression vector and transfected into NIH-3T3 fibroblasts or the T cell hybridoma By155.16 (28Sleckman B.P. Peterson A. Jones W.K. Foran J.A. Greenstein J.L. Seed B. Burakoff S.J. Nature. 1987; 328: 351-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 A, in the L3 TNFα mutant, the inactivation of the two proteolytic cleavage site at −10 and at +1 by the deletion of three amino acids each leads to the expected reduction in the molecular weight of the TNFα precursor compared to nonmutated tmTNFα. When transfected with wt TNFα construct, NIH3T3 cells secrete three protein species with a molecular mass of around 17 kDa, as revealed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2 B, lane 2). Sequential deletions of the known cleavage sites display altered Western blot patterns. In particular, deletion of the cleavage site at +1 results in the loss of one band and the appearance of a higher mobility band (Fig. 2 B, lane 3). On the other hand, deleting the cleavage site at −10 results in the disappearance of the slowest mobility band only (Fig. 2 B, lane 4). However, when cleavage sites at +1 and −10 were deleted, only one band was visible on Western blots (Fig. 2 B, lane 5). This TNFα species still exerts biological activity in a L929 bioassay. 2M. Imboden and S. Trachsel, unpublished observations. Hence, we inactivated the third potential cleavage site of mouse TNFα at position +11 by a Lys11 → Glu substitution (18Decoster E. Vanhaesebroeck B.

By155.16 T cells transfected with the resulting mutant L6 do not secrete TNFα into the supernatant as shown in a Western blot analysis (Fig. 2 C, lane 4) and in a L929 bioassay (Fig. 3 A). However, these L6 transfectants were unequivocally positive when tested for surface TNFα by FACS analysis using soluble TNFR-p55 hcγ3 fusion protein (9Hunger R.E. Muller S. Laissue J.A. Hess M.W. Carnaud C. Garcia I. Mueller C. J. Clin.

Co-cultures of L929 cells with wt TNFα-transfected By155.16, or vector-only (BCMGS-Neo)-transfected By155.16 cells as positive and negative controls, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3 B, L6 tmTNFα transfectants lyse L929 cells as efficiently as wt TNFα transfectants in a cell contact-dependent manner, whereas the supernatant of L6 overexpressing By155.16 transfectants, even upon 20-fold concentration by ammonium sulfate precipitation, is unable to lyse L929 cells in contrast to the supernatant of the wt TNFα transfectants that exerts potent cytotoxic activity in the L929 bioassay (Fig. 3 A). The cell contact-dependent lysis of L929 cells is inhibited by neutralizing anti-TNFα antibodies in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3 B).FIG. 2A, Western blot analysis of membrane-associated TNFα from NIH-3T3 fibroblasts transfected with BCMGS-Neo (lane 1), BCMGS-wt TNFα (lanes 2 and3; two different clones), and BCMGS-L3 mutant TNFα (lane 4).

There is increasing evidence that translation of several mRNAs is determined by the specific and regulated interaction of certain proteins with RNA elements in the 3′- and 5′-untranslated regions (for reviews, see Refs. 1Sachs A.B. Sarnow P. Hentze M.W. Cell. 1997; 89: 831-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar and 2Jackson R.J. Wickens M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Although many of these cis-acting RNA elements have been defined, only a few trans-acting regulatory proteins are known, and the mechanisms by which they regulate translation are poorly understood.As with cellular messages, translation of viral RNA is also subjected to complex regulation. For example, for positive strand RNA viruses, the genomic RNA is utilized as a template for translation, RNA replication, and formation of new virions; hence, the usage of the RNA must be regulated. For poliovirus, this regulation seems to be dependent on signals within the 5′-UTR.1 Whereas the majority of cellular mRNAs depend on the 5′-cap structure to initiate translation, poliovirus initiates translation internally via a cap-independent mechanism from an RNA element termed the internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) located within the 5′-UTR. Computer modeling and biochemical analysis suggest that the secondary structure of the poliovirus 5′-UTR is composed of six distinct domains, stem-loops I–VI (see Fig. 1 A). In addition to the canonical initiation factors, poliovirus translation initiation requires additional host cell factors, some of which appear to interact directly with the viral RNA (reviewed in Refs. 3Andino R. Böddeker N. Silvera D. Gamarnik A.V. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 76: 76-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (66) Google Scholar and 4Belsham G.J. Sonenberg N. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 499-511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among these essential factors are PCBP1 and PCBP2, two closely related poly(rC)-binding proteins, (also referred to as hnRNPs E1 and 2 or αCP1 and αCP2). These proteins facilitate viral translation through the interaction with both the first stem-loop domain (which folds into a cloverleaf-like structure) and stem-loop IV of the poliovirus 5′-UTR (5Blyn L.B.

J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6243-6246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both PCBP1 and PCBP2 form a low affinity complex with the cloverleaf RNA, but together with viral protein 3CD (the precursor of the viral polymerase 3D and the viral protease 3C), they are incorporated into a high affinity ternary ribonucleoprotein complex (9Andino R. Rieckhof G.E. Baltimore D. Cell. 1990; 63: 369-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar,10Andino R. Rieckhof G.E. Achacoso P.L. Baltimore D.

Cell. 1990; 63: 369-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Moreover, the interactions of the PCBPs and 3CD with the cloverleaf RNA seem to determine whether the genomic RNA is used as a template for protein synthesis or RNA replication. Binding of PCBPs to the cloverleaf stimulates viral translation, whereas binding of 3CD down-regulates translation (11Gamarnik A.V. Andino R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2293-2304Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar).Recent evidence indicates that association of PCBPs with a number of cellular mRNAs is important for their post-transcriptional regulation, either by stabilizing or by directly influencing the translational state of the mRNA (reviewed in Ref. 12Ostareck-Lederer A. Ostareck D.H. Hentze M.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 409-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). For instance, PCBPs interact with the highly stable 15-lipoxygenase mRNA (13Holcik M. Liebhaber S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2410-2414Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), inducing translational silencing presumably by inhibition of 80 S ribosome assembly (14Ostareck D.H. Ostareck-Lederer A. Wilm M. Thiele B.J. Mann M. Hentze M.W. Cell. 1997; 89: 597-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). In addition to their role in poliovirus translation, PCBPs have been implicated in the regulation of translation of other viral RNAs. Depletion of PCBPs from in vitro translation extracts leads to a reduction of protein synthesis from hepatitis A virus (15Graff J. Cha J. Blyn L.B. Ehrenfeld E. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9668-9675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); and addition of PCBP1, PCBP2, and hnRNP K to in vitro translation reactions induces translational silencing of the human papilloma virus type 16 L2 mRNA (16Collier B.

Chem. 1998; 273: 22648-22656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar).PCBP1 and PCBP2 contain three copies of the RNA-binding K homologous (KH) motif, first described for hnRNP K (17Siomi H. Matunis M.J. Michael W.M. Dreyfuss G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1193-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). The arrangement of these three motifs within hnRNP K, PCBP1, and PCBP2 is similar: two consecutive KH domains at the amino terminus followed by a region of variable sequence and length preceding a third KH motif. The degree of homology within the corresponding domain in all of these proteins is higher than that shared by KH motifs within the same polypeptide (18Leffers H. Dejgaard K. Celis J.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 447-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). No other known RNA-binding motif is found within the PCBPs, and the KH domains are able to function as discreet and independent nucleic acid-binding units: expression of each of the three domains individually demonstrated that the KH1 and KH3 domains of PCBP1 and PCBP2 specifically bind to poly(rC) homopolymers (19Dejgaard K. Leffers H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, the basis for the association of these KH domain-containing proteins with their specific RNA targets, such as the cloverleaf and stem-loop IV of the poliovirus 5′-UTR, remains to be established.We have examined the determinants for poliovirus RNA recognition in PCBP. By expression of individual KH domains, we have found that KH1, the first KH motif of PCBP, is able to specifically recognize both the cloverleaf and stem-loop IV structures of the poliovirus 5′-UTR. In addition, the KH1 domain retains the ability to form a high affinity ternary complex with the cloverleaf and viral protein 3CD. Finally, we show that the KH1 protein specifically inhibits translation from a poliovirus IRES and not from a capped mRNA and that this effect appears to be mediated by a direct competition of KH1 with endogenous PCBPs for the binding sites within the poliovirus 5′-UTR. Translation in eukaryotic cells is a highly regulated process involving a complex protein machinery. There is increasing evidence that translation of several mRNAs is determined by the specific and regulated interaction of certain proteins with RNA elements in the 3′- and 5′-untranslated regions (for reviews, see Refs. 1Sachs A.B. Sarnow P. Hentze M.W. Cell. 1997; 89: 831-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar and 2Jackson R.J. Wickens M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Although many of these cis-acting RNA elements have been defined, only a few trans-acting regulatory proteins are known, and the mechanisms by which they regulate translation are poorly understood. As with cellular messages, translation of viral RNA is also subjected to complex regulation. For example, for positive strand RNA viruses, the genomic RNA is utilized as a template for translation, RNA replication, and formation of new virions; hence, the usage of the RNA must be regulated. For poliovirus, this regulation seems to be dependent on signals within the 5′-UTR.1 Whereas the majority of cellular mRNAs depend on the 5′-cap structure to initiate translation, poliovirus initiates translation internally via a cap-independent mechanism from an RNA element termed the internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) located within the 5′-UTR. Computer modeling and biochemical analysis suggest that the secondary structure of the poliovirus 5′-UTR is composed of six distinct domains, stem-loops I–VI (see Fig. 1 A). In addition to the canonical initiation factors, poliovirus translation initiation requires additional host cell factors, some of which appear to interact directly with the viral RNA (reviewed in Refs. 3Andino R. Böddeker N. Silvera D. Gamarnik A.V. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 76: 76-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (66) Google Scholar and 4Belsham G.J. Sonenberg N. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 499-511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among these essential factors are PCBP1 and PCBP2, two closely related poly(rC)-binding proteins, (also referred to as hnRNPs E1 and 2 or αCP1 and αCP2). These proteins facilitate viral translation through the interaction with both the first stem-loop domain (which folds into a cloverleaf-like structure) and stem-loop IV of the poliovirus 5′-UTR (5Blyn L.B.

J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6243-6246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both PCBP1 and PCBP2 form a low affinity complex with the cloverleaf RNA, but together with viral protein 3CD (the precursor of the viral polymerase 3D and the viral protease 3C), they are incorporated into a high affinity ternary ribonucleoprotein complex (9Andino R. Rieckhof G.E. Baltimore D. Cell. 1990; 63: 369-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar,10Andino R. Rieckhof G.E. Achacoso P.L. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3587-3598Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Ternary complex formation is required for positive strand RNA synthesis (9Andino R. Rieckhof G.E. Baltimore D. Cell. 1990; 63: 369-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Moreover, the interactions of the PCBPs and 3CD with the cloverleaf RNA seem to determine whether the genomic RNA is used as a template for protein synthesis or RNA replication. Binding of PCBPs to the cloverleaf stimulates viral translation, whereas binding of 3CD down-regulates translation (11Gamarnik A.V. Andino R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2293-2304Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that association of PCBPs with a number of cellular mRNAs is important for their post-transcriptional regulation, either by stabilizing or by directly influencing the translational state of the mRNA (reviewed in Ref. 12Ostareck-Lederer A. Ostareck D.H. Hentze M.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 409-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). For instance, PCBPs interact with the highly stable 15-lipoxygenase mRNA (13Holcik M. Liebhaber S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2410-2414Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), inducing translational silencing presumably by inhibition of 80 S ribosome assembly (14Ostareck D.H. Ostareck-Lederer A. Wilm M. Thiele B.J. Mann M. Hentze M.W. Cell. 1997; 89: 597-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). In addition to their role in poliovirus translation, PCBPs have been implicated in the regulation of translation of other viral RNAs. Depletion of PCBPs from in vitro translation extracts leads to a reduction of protein synthesis from hepatitis A virus (15Graff J. Cha J. Blyn L.B. Ehrenfeld E. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9668-9675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); and addition of PCBP1, PCBP2, and hnRNP K to in vitro translation reactions induces translational silencing of the human papilloma virus type 16 L2 mRNA (16Collier B. Goobar-Larsson L. Sokolowski M. Schwartz S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22648-22656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). PCBP1 and PCBP2 contain three copies of the RNA-binding K homologous (KH) motif, first described for hnRNP K (17Siomi H. Matunis M.J. Michael W.M. Dreyfuss G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1193-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). The arrangement of these three motifs within hnRNP K, PCBP1, and PCBP2 is similar: two consecutive KH domains at the amino terminus followed by a region of variable sequence and length preceding a third KH motif. The degree of homology within the corresponding domain in all of these proteins is higher than that shared by KH motifs within the same polypeptide (18Leffers H. Dejgaard K. Celis J.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 447-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). No other known RNA-binding motif is found within the PCBPs, and the KH domains are able to function as discreet and independent nucleic acid-binding units: expression of each of the three domains individually demonstrated that the KH1 and KH3 domains of PCBP1 and PCBP2 specifically bind to poly(rC) homopolymers (19Dejgaard K.

In the present study, a conditionally active form of Etk was constructed by fusing the hormone-binding domain of estrogen receptor (ER) to an amino terminus truncated form of Etk, PHΔ1–68Etk, to generate ΔEtk:ER. In stably transfected Pa-4ΔEtk:ER cells, the activity of ΔEtk:ER was stimulated within minutes by the treatment of ΔEtk:ER stimulant, estradiol, and sustained for greater than 24 h. A robust induction in the phosphorylation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins, including STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5, was accompanied with ΔEtk:ER activation. Moreover, the conditionally activated Etk stimulated STAT1- and STAT5-dependent reporter activities by ∼160- and ∼15-fold, respectively, however, elicited only a modest STAT3-mediated reporter activation. Qualitatively comparable results were obtained in lung A549 cells, indicating that ΔEtk:ER inducible system could function in an analogous fashion in different epithelial cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Etk activation alone augmented cyclin D1 promoter/enhancer activity via its STAT5 response element in both Pa-4ΔEtk:ER and A549 cells. Altogether, these findings support the notion that the activation of Etk kinase is sufficient to transactivate STAT-mediated gene expression.

Robinson D. Pretlow T.G. Kung H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3644-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 2Weil D. Power M.A. Smith S.I. Li C.L. Blood. 1997; 90: 4332-4340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Interest in the function and regulation of Etk/BMX activity has been invigorated by the findings that this enzyme belongs to the Tec family of non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinases including additional members of Btk, Itk, Tec, and Txk (reviewed in Ref. 3Rawlings D.J. Witte O.N. Semin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). For example, Etk/BMX compensates for the lack of Btk activity in B-cell receptor signal transduction by reconstituting phospholipase Cγ2-dependent responses in Btk-deficient DT40 cells (4Tomlinson M.G. Kurosaki T. Berson A.E. Fujii G.H. Johnston J.A. Bolen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13577-13585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, these activities may not be the primary in vivo function of Etk/BMX, since Etk/BMX is predominantly expressed in lung and prostate tissues, as well as in salivary epithelial, endothelial, and granulomonocytic cells (1, 2, and this report), but not in B-cells. The PH domain, located at the Etk amino terminus, is a protein module that has been found in many signal transduction proteins to mediate either protein-lipid or protein-protein interactions (5Haslam R.J. Koide H.B. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1993; 363: 309-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Activation of PI 3-kinase is a prerequisite for Etk/BMX activation, presumably due to the direct interaction between the resultant lipid product and the Etk/BMX PH domain (6Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it could be an indirect activation event via a PI 3-kinase-dependent kinase. The PH domain of other Tec family members is known to interact with βγ subunits of the heterotrimeric G protein (7Langhans-Rajasekaran S.A. Wan Y. Huang X.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8601-8605Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Mutations in the PH domain of Btk, an Etk/BMX-related non-receptor tyrosine kinase, are responsible for the X chromosome-linked agammaglobulinemia in human and the X chromosome-linked immunodeficiency in mice, where B-cell maturation is blocked (8Mattsson P.T. Vihinen M. Smith C.I. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 825-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 9Rawlings D.J. Saffran D.C. Tsukada S. Largaespada D.A. Grimaldi J.C. Cohen L. Mohr R.N. Bazan J.F.

In terms of protein-protein interaction, Gα12/13 and protein kinase C have also been demonstrated to interact with the PH domains of Btk and Etk/BMX (11Mao J. Xie W. Yuan H. Simon M.I. Mano H. Wu D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5638-5646Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 12Jiang Y. Ma W. Wan Y. Kozasa T. Hattori S. Huang X.Y.

Blood. 1997; 90: 4341-4353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These protein-protein interactions are proposed to be essential in modulating Btk and Etk/BMX activity. In addition, a protein tyrosine phosphatase, PTPD1, which was identified by a yeast two-hybrid screen using the Etk PH domain as a bait, is able to enhance STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation in COS cells. 2R.-J. Tseng, H.-Y. Jui, H.-J. Kung, and H.-M. Shih, manuscript in preparation. However, based on the elegant genetic studies on Drosophila Btk homologue, Dsrc29A, it is of interest to note that the PH domain of Dsrc29A is dispensable for Drosophila copulation and survival (14Baba K. Takeshita A. Majima K. Ueda R. Kondo S. Juni N. Yamamoto D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4405-4413Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It has been shown that Etk is involved in the interleukin-6-dependent signal transduction cascade and its consequent neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate cells (1Qiu Y. Robinson D. Pretlow T.G. Kung H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3644-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) and the Src-mediated cell transformation. 3Y.-H. Su, Y.-T. Tsai, S.-S. Fang, T.-N. Huang, Y.-S. Jou, H.-M. Shih, H.-J. Kung, and R.-H. Chen, manuscript in preparation. Recently, Etk was reported to protect prostate carcinoma LNCaP cells against apoptosis induced by photodynamic therapy and thapsigargin (15Xue L.Y. Qiu Y. He J. Kung H.J. Oleinick N.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3391-3398Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The precise biological function of Etk in epithelial cells is not well established. The Etk/BMX-mediated cellular responses have mainly been studied by using a dominant negative form of Etk to attenuate its function (1Qiu Y. Robinson D. Pretlow T.G. Kung H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3644-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 15Xue L.Y. Qiu Y. He J. Kung H.J. Oleinick N.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3391-3398Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) or a cytokine stimulation/antigen cross-linking approach to activate Etk/BMX kinase activities (1Qiu Y. Robinson D. Pretlow T.G. Kung H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3644-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 4Tomlinson M.G. Kurosaki T. Berson A.E. Fujii G.H. Johnston J.A. Bolen J.B. J.

These studies have yielded important information, however, generally addressed only a particular experimental condition without determining the specificity of each individual signaling cascade. For instance, both cytokine stimulation and antigen cross-linking events can elicit a pleiotropic effect by activating more than one signaling pathway. Indeed, JAK, Src, Ras, and PI 3-kinase signaling pathways are all rapidly activated in response to cytokine stimulation (16Paul W.E. Seder R.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 241-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1700) Google Scholar, 17Corey S.J. Burkhardt A.L. Bolen J.B. Geahlen R.L. Tkatch L.S. Tweardy D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Concomitant activation of multiple signaling pathways by a stimulant, such as a cytokine, makes it difficult to pursue and define the exact biological role(s) of Etk/BMX activation. Similarly, it has been suggested that the use of dominant-negative constructs in certain biological systems has sometimes yielded apparently confusing information, even turns out to be more the exception than the rule (Ref. 20Teglund S. McKay C. Schuetz E. van Deursen J.M. Stravopodis D. Wang D. Brown M. Bodner S. Grosveld G. Ihle J.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 841-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar and references therein). Furthermore, the unanticipated function(s) of Etk could be overlooked by these approaches. In this report, we described the construction and characterization of a conditionally active Etk molecule. To achieve this, the DNA fragment encoding the hormone-binding domain of estrogen receptor (ER) (21Samuels M.L. Weber M.J. Bishop J.M. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6241-6252Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) was fused in-frame to the 3′-end of an Etk variant, PHΔ1–68Etk, to create the ΔEtk:ER expression construct. While the PHΔ1–68Etk NH2 terminus deletion mutant exhibited constitutive kinase activity, the catalytic activity of ΔEtk:ER fusion protein was blocked in the absence of β-estradiol (E2, a ΔEtk:ER stimulant). The ΔEtk:ER activity was induced within 15 to 30 min following E2 addition and sustained for at least 24 h. This ΔEtk:ER expression construct, which encodes a conditionally activated version of Etk, was employed to investigate the signal transduction and gene regulation events following Etk activation. Our results shown hereby suggest that the E2-inducible form of ΔEtk:ER represents a unique and useful tool to elucidate the role(s) of Etk/BMX in modulating cellular signal transduction pathways and subsequent responses in epithelial cells as well as in other cell types. Standard molecular cloning techniques were used to construct an inducible ΔEtk:ER chimera. In brief, the hormone-binding domain of human estrogen receptor (hER-HBD) was fused in-frame to an amino terminus truncated form of human Etk, PHΔ1–68Etk, to engineer an E2-inducible form of Etk, ΔEtk:ER. The DNA fragment encoding amino acid residues 69–674 of Etk was generated by PCR amplification using a primer pair (5′-primer, 5′-CGGCTCGAGCCATGGAGGAGCAGACGCCTGTAGAGAGACAG-3′; and 3′-primer, 5′-GCCGCTAGCTTATGCTTGTCTTTTTCCCGAAGTGG-3′). To facilitate cloning, the respective unique restriction enzyme sites of XhoI and NheI were built in these primers, as underlined. A Kozak sequence with translation initiator ATGwas introduced to the 5′-primer to facilitate translation initiation of the engineered protein. The 1.8-kilobase PCR product was first cloned into pCR2.1 using a TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The insert was subsequently excised from the vector and subcloned into theXhoI/NheI sites of a hER-HBD containing vector pBS-hbER (a gift from Dr. M. McMahon, University of California, San Francisco) to produce a HBD-containing Etk chimera, ΔEtk:ER. The ΔEtk:ER fusion fragment was then excised by XhoI andClaI double digestion and subcloned intoXhoI/ClaI sites of a neomycin resistance gene containing expression vector pLNCX (21Samuels M.L. Weber M.J. Bishop J.M. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6241-6252Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). All constructs were verified by restriction enzyme digestions and partial DNA sequence analyses. The STAT5-mediated reporter constructs, 4xp21-SIE2-Luc and 4xp21-SIE2m-Luc, and the TK-promoter reporter, pTK-Luc, were kindly provided by Dr. A. Schonthal (University of Southern California), and the STAT1-mediated reporter construct, 3xLy6E-Luc, was a gift from Dr. W. Li (University of Southern California). The cyclin D1 reporter constructs, -1745-CD-1-Luc, 3xD1-SIE1-Luc, and 3xD1-SIE1m-Luc were generously sent to us from Dr. I. Matsumura (Osaka University). Rat parotid epithelial cell line Pa-4, also known as the parotid C5 cell, was cultured as described previously (22Lin H.H. Tu Z.J. Ann D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27637-27644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Rat Pa-4ΔEtk:ER cell line was established by transfecting Pa-4 cells with the inducible construct ΔEtk:ER by the LipofectAMINE-mediated method according to the standard procedure suggested by the manufacturer. After selection with Geneticin (G418, 600 μg/ml), the resistant clones were isolated, expanded, and screened by Western analyses for ΔEtk:ER expression. The clones that ectopically expressed ΔEtk:ER fusion protein were selected for further studies. Among 10 selected clones, clone Etk8, which exhibited the highest ΔEtk:ER activity upon E2 treatment, was employed in this study and hereafter designated as Pa-4ΔEtk:ER cells and was maintained as described previously (22Lin H.H. Tu Z.J. Ann D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27637-27644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Pa-4ΔEtk:ER cells and parental Pa-4 cells were treated with 1 μmE2 for different time periods and lysed with 1 × SDS loading buffer. Approximately 20 μg of whole cell extract from each sample was subjected to a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The immunoblot analyses were carried out as described previously (23Li D. Lin H.H. McMahon M. Ma H. Ann D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25062-25070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The anti-PY-STAT and anti-STAT antibodies used were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) and Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), respectively. For immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer containing 1 × PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 30 μl/ml aprotinin (Sigma), and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. Subsequently, the ΔEtk:ER fusion protein was precipitated from the cell lysates with either an anti-ER antibody (HC-20, Santa Cruz, CA) or an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) as described previously (23Li D. Lin H.H. McMahon M. Ma H. Ann D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25062-25070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and followed by immunoblot analyses using reciprocal antibodies. All the transient transfection experiments were performed using LipofectAMINETM reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (22Lin H.H. Tu Z.J. Ann D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27637-27644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and the plasmid DNA used for the transfection was prepared using the Qiagen kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) as instructed. A total of 2 μg of DNA was used for transient transfection of cells at approximately 80% confluence in a 35-mm Petri dish. Luciferase assays were performed using Dual Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI), and the luciferase activity was measured by a luminometer (Turner TD-20e). The plasmid pRL-TK, which directs the expression of Renilla luciferase under the control of HSV TK promoter, was co-transfected and utilized as an internal control for normalizing the transfection efficiency. We recently cloned a reverse transcription-PCR fragment from RNAs of rat parotid glands and a rat salivary cell line, Pa-4. The DNA sequences and their derived amino acid sequences of the cloned PCR fragments were more than 95% identical to those corresponding regions in human and mouse Etk/BMX (24Tamagnone L. Lahtinen I.

Kaipainen A. Alitalo K. Circulation. 1997; 96: 1729-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The degenerated primer pairs were designed, based on known homologous human Etk genomic structure (GenBank accession number AC003669), to encompass several intron/exon junctions in order to rule out the possibility of amplifying DNA contaminant in the PCR reaction. Hence, it is concluded that Etk is expressed in rat parotid glands and salivary Pa-4 cells. To investigate Etk function in epithelial cells, we attempted to establish cell lines expressing conditionally active Etk, of which activity can be regulated. There are several strategies existing to make a conditionally active kinase construct (26Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bender G. Muller G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2051) Google Scholar, 27Spencer D.M. Wandless T.J. Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1993; 262: 1019-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). We had previous success in using the conditionally active Raf-1, ΔRaf-1:ER, which was engineered by fusing the kinase domain of Raf-1 with the HBD of human ER, in our studies to characterize the biological function mediated by the Raf-1 kinase activation in epithelial cells (23Li D. Lin H.H. McMahon M. Ma H. Ann D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25062-25070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 28Zentner M.D. Lin H.H. Wen X. Kim K.J. Ann D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30770-30776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A similar approach was employed to construct a conditionally active Etk for our current studies. It has been reported that the ectopically expressed full-length Etk does not have a potent kinase function by itself; however, the deletion of its PH domain results in a constitutive activation (1Qiu Y. Robinson D. Pretlow T.G. Kung H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3644-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Therefore, an Etk variant with a truncated amino terminus PH domain (PHΔ1–68) was engineered. As expected, the resultant PHΔ1–68Etk was constitutively active when expressed in Pa-4 cells (data not shown). To generate a conditionally active form of Etk, the HBD of human ER was fused in-frame to this amino terminus truncated Etk, PHΔ1–68Etk (Fig. 1). Subsequently, the DNA fragment encoding the fusion protein was subcloned into an expression vector carrying a neomycin resistance gene to create ΔEtk:ER expression construct. As predicted, the kinase activity of ΔEtk:ER chimeric protein was exclusively dependent upon E2 treatment and independent of the input from other signaling pathways, such as PI 3-kinase or JAK activation following cytokine stimulation (data not shown). To investigate the primary biochemical events following Etk activation, Pa-4 cells were stably transfected with ΔEtk:ER expression construct. The phosphorylation of Tyr566 in Etk has been characterized as a hallmark for Etk activation. Hence, a clone of cells exhibiting the highest stimulated ΔEtk:ER autophosphorylation, as assessed by Western analysis with an anti-phosphotyrosine (anti-Tyr(P)) antibody (data not shown), was selected for further studies and hereafter referred to as Pa-4ΔEtk:ER. Based on our preliminary results, the anti-human ER antibody recognized exclusively the ΔEtk:ER fusion protein in Pa-4ΔEtk:ER cell lysates. This antibody was employed to immunoprecipitate the ΔEtk:ER fusion protein to investigate the nature of E2-dependent ΔEtk:ER activation. Accordingly, the ΔEtk:ER protein was first immunoprecipitated by the anti-ER antibody from lysates derived from each time point before or after 1 μm E2 exposure. These immunoprecipitates were further analyzed by Western blot and probed with an anti-Tyr(P) antibody to detect ΔEtk:ER auto-tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 2 A). We found that the tyrosine phosphorylation of ΔEtk:ER was elicited by exposing Pa-4ΔEtk:ER cells to the ΔEtk:ER stimulant, E2, for only 15–30 min and the phosphorylation signal persisted throughout the 4 h of treatment. To confirm that the tyrosine phosphorylation of ΔEtk:ER was E2-dependent and to investigate the duration of ΔEtk:ER stimulation, immunoprecipitations were carried out with an anti-Tyr(P) antibody in a separate experiment. Western blots of the immunoprecipitates were then probed with an ER-specific antibody, as shown in Fig. 2 B. A comparable E2-dependent ΔEtk:ER phosphorylation pattern was obtained and the level of phosphorylation sustained for 24 h. Taken together, as shown in Fig. 2 D, the tyrosine phosphorylation of ΔEtk:ER was readily induced within 30 min of E2 treatment and a further elevation was observed with longer exposure to the ΔEtk:ER stimulant. The level of tyrosine phosphorylation reached the maximum, approximately 60-fold over basal level, following 8 h of stimulation. This sustained activation of ΔEtk:ER then lasted for 24 h with a gradual decrease. In contrast, the tyrosine phosphorylation of ΔEtk:ER in Pa-4ΔEtk:ER cells treated with vehicle alone or prior to treatment was not detected by both approaches. The ΔEtk:ER protein expression level was also analyzed over the 24-h course of treatment by immunoblotting using an anti-ER antibody. As shown in Fig. 2 C, E2 treatment elicited a rather modest, if any, increase in the ΔEtk:ER fusion protein level (upper panel) when compared with the corresponding eIF-2α level, which served as an internal control for sample loading (lower panel). Hence, it unambiguously excludes the possibility that the robust increase in the ΔEtk:ER autophosphorylation signal detected in Fig. 2, A andB, is caused by an increase in ΔEtk:ER protein expression level. Moreover, we propose that a direct activation of ΔEtk:ER kinase activity entails the ΔEtk:ER tyrosine phosphorylation. We subsequently assessed whether conditionally active ΔEtk:ER alone would be sufficient, independent of cytokine stimulation, to modulate gene expression. The cytokine-activated Etk/BMX has previously been shown to stimulate STAT signaling pathway activation in COS cells (13Saharinen P. Ekman N. Sarvas K. Parker P. Alitalo K. Silvennoinen O. Blood. 1997; 90: 4341-4353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). STAT tyrosine phosphorylation is obligatory for STAT activation, which could be detected by a change in the immunoreactivity by using antibodies against tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT (29Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5062) Google Scholar). Individual lysate was prepared from Pa-4ΔEtk:ER cells that had been treated with E2 for up to 24 h to test the hypothesis that E2-bound ΔEtk:ER chimera stimulates the downstream STAT signaling pathway via its tyrosine kinase function. These lysates were then analyzed by probing the Western blots with the specific antiserum recognizing tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5, respectively. A time-dependent increase in the STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation levels was notable in lysates from E2-treated Pa-4ΔEtk:ER cells (Fig. 3). As shown in Fig. 3, the E2-stimulated phosphorylation event was delayed for 1 to 2 h following stimulation, reached a maximum at approximately 12 h post-treatment, and decreased thereafter. The control blots demonstrated a consistent level of individual STAT proteins in Pa-4ΔEtk:ER cell lysates at each time point. It was apparent that both STAT1α and STAT1β were tyrosine-phosphorylated judging from the Western analyses (top panel, Fig. 3 A), whereas the nature of STAT5 (STAT5A or STAT5B) in salivary cells was unclear. By comparing the kinetics of STAT phosphorylation and ΔEtk:ER induction, we conclude that the STAT activation event occurs downstream of ΔEtk:ER activation. Furthermore, the different intensities observed among individual immunoreactivities that were detected by each anti-tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT-specific antibody may have resulted from different sensitivities of each antibody employed. Conceivably, the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of each STAT by Etk could be even faster than demonstrated. Moreover, that E2 treatment did not result in any detectable STAT tyrosine phosphorylation in parental Pa-4 cells (data not shown) rules out the possibility that a putative E2-dependent tyrosine kinase stimulates STAT tyrosine phosphorylation directly. To establish that Etk activation alone is capable of stimulating STAT-mediated gene expression, transient transfection and reporter gene assays were performed. Pa-4ΔEtk:ER cells were first transfected with 3xLy6E-GasLuc (a reporter gene for STAT1) (30Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar), pLucTKS3 (a reporter gene for STAT3) (31Turkson J. Bowman T. Garcia R. Caldenhoven E. De Groot R.P. Jove R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2545-2552Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar), and 4xp21-SIE2-Luc (a reporter gene for STAT5) (32Matsumura I. Ishikawa J. Nakajima K. Oritani K. Tomiyama Y. Miyagawa J. Kato T. Miyazaki H. Matsuzawa Y. Kanakura Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2933-2943Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), then stimulated with E2, and followed by luciferase assays. As shown in Fig. 4 A, activated Etk was able to reproducibly induce the STAT1 and STAT5 reporter activities by more than 160- and ∼15-fold, respectively, over the basal level. In addition, luciferase activities from the construct, 4xp21-SIE2m, carrying mutated STAT5 recognition sites, and the parental pTK-Luc construct were not elevated by Etk stimulation, indicating that the observed enhancing effect was a result of specific DNA-protein interaction between the tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1/STAT5 and their response elements, respectively. Moreover, Etk activation rendered a greater stimulation on the STAT1-response element over the STAT5-driven reporter construct. The reason for this differential induction is not clear, although highly reproducible. Together, we concluded that Etk-mediated phosphorylation events are sufficient to transactivate the STAT1-/STAT5-response element-mediated reporter activation. By contrast, the luciferase activity from pLucTKS3 (a reporter gene for STAT3) was only moderately enhanced by the activated ΔEtk:ER (Fig. 4 A). In a separate experiment, the overexpression of JAK2 was able to enhance the pLucTKS3 activity by 30-fold (Fig. 4 C). Since a specific anti-phospho-STAT3 (Tyr705) antibody was utilized in our studies shown in Fig. 3, the Tyr705 residue of endogenous STAT3 was assumed to be phosphorylated upon Etk activation. However, this Etk-stimulated STAT3, when compared with the JAK2-activated STAT3, appeared to have relatively modest transactivation ability. This is unanticipated, but with a precedent (Ref. 30Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar, and see “Discussion”). Similar to that in Pa-4 cells, Etk stimulated the STAT1/STAT5, but not the STAT3-mediated reporter activation to a great extent in lung epithelial A549 cells (Fig. 4 B), suggesting that the ΔEtk:ER inducible system could function in an analogous fashion in different epithelial cells. To assure that Etk activation alone was sufficient to modulate STAT-response element in"

Exposure of permeabilized mast cells to calcium/ATP induces cortical F-actin disassembly (calmodulin-dependent) and secretion (calmodulin-independent). The delay in the onset of secretion is characteristic for the calcium/ATP response and is abolished by GTP. Here we report that a constitutively active mutant of Rho (V14RhoA) enhanced both secretion and cortical F-actin disassembly. In addition, V14RhoA mimicked GTP by abolishing the delay in secretion.

Changes in the rigidity of the cortical actin network constitute an important component of the cellular response to receptor activation and require localized disassembly of cortical actin filaments. Signals from cell surface receptors to the cytoskeleton are often mediated by small GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family, e.g. RhoA, -B, -C, -D, -E, and -G; Rac1 and -2; Cdc42; and TC10. Several targets for the members of this family have been identified, including a number of serine threonine kinases (PKN, Rho kinase, p65 PAK) and tyrosine kinases (p120 ACK, MLK3). In addition to cell morphology, Rho GTPases control many other functions such as neuronal development, cell cycle, and gene transcription (1Takai Y. Sasaki T. Tanaka K. Nakanishi H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 227-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 2Tapon N. Hall A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 3Vojtek A.B.

New evidence indicates participation of Rho GTPases in the regulation of exocytosis, endocytosis, and vesicular transport in general (4Price L.S. Norman J.C. Ridley A.J. Koffer A. Curr.

O'Sullivan A.J. Gomperts B.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1053-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To what extent this is accomplished via regulation of actin is still unclear. Cortical actin disassembly is particularly important for secreting cells; cortical filaments have long been considered to act as a barrier preventing the access of secretory granules to the plasma membrane (10Burgoyne R.D. Cheek T.R. Biosci. Rep. 1985; 7: 281-288Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Mast cells serve as a useful model for investigating the relationship between cytoskeletal rearrangements and exocytosis (11Pfeiffer J.R. Seagrave J.C. Davis B.H. Deanin G.G. Oliver J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 2145-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Use of permeabilized cells allows control of the internal environment and thus investigation of specific effects induced by ions, nucleotides, or proteins. Such studies have established that calcium and GTP, acting in synergy, induce high levels of secretion (12Howell T.W. Cockcroft S. Gomperts B.D. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). With respect to the cytoskeletal effects, GTPγS,1 a nonhydrolyzable analogue of GTP, was found to induce a selective loss and increase of F-actin in the cell cortex and interior, respectively. The former effect is not significantly inhibited by a Rho-specific inhibitor, C3 transferase, while the latter is entirely dependent on the activity of Rho (13Norman J.C. Price L.S. Ridley A.J. Hall A. Koffer A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1005-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Secretion induced by calcium alone (i.e. in the absence of added GTP/GTPγS) is associated only with a profound loss of the cortical F-actin (14Borovikov Y.S. Norman J.C. Price L.S. Weeds A. Koffer A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 657-666PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, cortical F-actin disassembly is induced by both calcium-dependent and -independent pathways. In this paper, we have focused on the calcium-dependent responses of permeabilized mast cells. Calcium-induced cortical F-actin disassembly requires calmodulin; it is promoted by the addition of exogenous calmodulin and strongly inhibited by depletion of the endogenous calmodulin. None of these effects, however, are accompanied by changes in the secretory responses. The main target for calmodulin is myosin light chain kinase; its inhibitor, ML-7, prevents cortical disassembly, again without effects on secretion. 2R. Sullivan, M. Burnham, and A. Koffer, submitted for publication. 2R. Sullivan, M. Burnham, and A. Koffer, submitted for publication. Thus, myosin II-based contractility, activated by calcium-calmodulin, may be a prerequisite for cortical F-actin disassembly. Calcium-induced secretion is greatly enhanced by constitutively active mutants of Rho-related GTPases, V14RhoA and V12Rac1, and inhibited by a specific Rho inhibitor, C3 transferase (4Price L.S. Norman J.C. Ridley A.J. Koffer A. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 68-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). It is relatively resistant to inhibition of Rac by a dominant-inhibitory Rac protein, N17Rac1 (4Price L.S. Norman J.C. Ridley A.J. Koffer A. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 68-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Here, we have examined the role of Rho in calcium-dependent secretion in relation to its cytoskeletal effects. Rho was found to regulate both secretion and cortical F-actin disassembly in a manner that is synergistic with and/or dependent on calcium but is calmodulin-independent. The latter function of Rho is additional to and distinct from the Rho-induced de novo actin polymerization (which is calcium-independent). Stabilization of actin filaments by high concentration of phalloidin prevented neither secretion nor the secretion-enhancing effects of Rho, supporting the model for divergent regulation of actin and exocytosis by this GTPase. This model is further supported by a finding that compound Y-27632, a specific inhibitor of Rho-associated protein kinase, p160 ROCK, attenuated the loss of cortical F-actin without affecting secretion. GTPγS and ATP were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Streptolysin-O was from Murex Diagnostics (Dartford, UK). Glass “Multitest” slides (6-mm diameter wells) were from ICN Biomedicals (Aurora, OH). Compound Y-27632 was a generous gift from Yoshitomi Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma. Escherichia coli transfected with expression vectors containing GST-V14RhoA DNA, GST-V12Rac1 DNA or GST-C3 transferase DNA were kindly provided by Dr. Anne Ridley, and the glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins were prepared and cleaved as described (15Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3788) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. V14RhoA was preactivated by loading with GTP (16Hall A. Self A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10963-10965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activated protein was stabilized by the addition of MgCl2 to give a final Mg2+concentration of 2 mm, dialyzed, and concentrated using the Microsep 10-kDa cut-off centrifugal concentrators (Filtron, North Borough, MA). This final dialysate was used for control experiments. Active protein concentrations were determined by a filter binding assay using [3H]GDP (16Hall A. Self A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10963-10965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Concentrations of active proteins (usually 60–70% of total) are given for all of the experiments. Calmodulin was purified from bovine brain according to the protocol in Ref. 17Torok K. Trentham D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12807-12820Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar. The calmodulin-inhibitory peptide, MLCK peptide (MLCKP; Ac-RRKWQKTGHAVRAIGRL-CONH2), and its control peptide (Ac-RRKEQKTGHAVRAIGRE-CONH2) (17Torok K. Trentham D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12807-12820Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) were gifts from Dr. Kati Torok (School of Biological Sciences, Queen Mary and Westfield College, University of London, UK). Rat peritoneal mast cells were prepared as described previously (18Cockcroft S. Howell T.W. Gomperts B.D. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2745-2750Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The cells were resuspended in a solution containing 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.0 mmCaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, 1 mg ml−1 bovine serum albumin, and 20 mm NaPIPES, pH 7.2 (chloride buffer). For confocal microscopy, cells in chloride buffer were allowed to attach to glass slides for 1 h at room temperature (∼25,000 cells/well). Suspended cells were used for flow cytometry and for hexosaminidase assays. Suspended cells (usually 1–2 × 106 cells/ml) were permeabilized for 2 min at 30 °C in a buffer containing 137 mm sodium glutamate, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20 mm NaPIPES, pH 6.8 (glutamate buffer (GB)) in the presence of 3 mm EGTA (GB-EGTA) and streptolysin-O (0.4 units/ml). To permeabilize glass-attached cells, the cells were washed with GB and then exposed for 8 min at room temperature to streptolysin-O at 0.4 units/ml in GB-EGTA. After permeabilization, both suspended and attached cells were washed free of soluble components and excess streptolysin-O with GB-EGTA. Cells were stimulated by the addition of the indicated combinations of calcium, EGTA, ATP, and GTPγS. Free Ca2+concentration was buffered by 3 mm Ca2+ EGTA buffer system, pH 6.8, with appropriate dissociation constants as given in Ref. 19Martell A.E. Smith R.M. Critical Stability Constants. Plenum Press, New York1974: XI-XIIGoogle Scholar. Control cells were exposed to 3 mm EGTA, 3 mm ATP in GB. Hexosaminidase release from at least duplicate samples was assayed as described previously (18Cockcroft S. Howell T.W. Gomperts B.D. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2745-2750Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Where indicated, attached or suspended rat peritoneal mast cells were permeabilized as above and pretreated with the specified agents (phalloidin, C3 together with NAD+, or V14RhoA in the GTP-bound form). While V14RhoA was left with the cells throughout the experiment, C3 together with 0.5 mm NAD+ was removed just prior to the addition of triggers. Intact cells, suspended in chloride buffer, were treated with unconjugated succinyl-concanavalin A (100 μg/ml for 10 min at room temperature) to reduce the background staining. Cells were then washed, permeabilized as above, and exposed to 3 mm EGTA (control) or to the triggers (20 min at 30 °C). The incubation was stopped by the addition of cold GB, and the cells were pelletted by centrifugation (5 min at 1500 × g), resuspended in GB-EGTA containing fluorescein isothiocyanate-succinyl-concanavalin A (64 μg/ml). After 20 min on ice, the stain was washed off (twice with GB-EGTA), and the cells were finally resuspended (approximately 5 × 105ml−1) in GB-EGTA containing 0.5% formaldehyde (without any bovine serum albumin) and analyzed on an EPICS Elite flow cytometer (Coulter Electronics Inc., Hialeah, FL), equipped with an argon ion laser. Excitation was at 488 nm, and emission was at 525 nm. Forward angle (1.5–19°) and 90° light scatter and relative fluorescence intensity readings were collected. Freehand “gates” were drawn around subpopulations on two-parameter light scatter distributions using the Elite software, and the relative fluorescence intensity of cells falling within these gates was plotted on one parameter histograms. Staining with rhodamine phalloidin (RP) was performed either before (prelabeling) or after (postlabeling) cell activation. Where indicated, suspended mast cells were permeabilized and prelabeled with 0.1 μm RP in GB-EGTA (10 min on ice). Cells were then washed with GB and exposed to various triggering solutions for 20 min at 30 °C, quenched with cold GB, fixed, and analyzed as above. This was performed after the triggering and the quenching of the cells but before their fixation: 0.5 μm RP in GB-EGTA, 20 min on ice. In some experiments (see Fig. 5 B), cells were pretreated with 2 μm unlabeled phalloidin in order to stabilize actin filaments, and this was followed by postlabeling with 0.5 μm RP. After staining, cells were washed with GB-EGTA, resuspended (approximately 5 × 105 ml−1) in GB-EGTA containing 0.5% formaldehyde (without any bovine serum albumin), and analyzed on an EPICS Elite flow cytometer (Coulter Electronics), equipped with an argon ion laser. Excitation was at 488 nm, and emission was at 575 nm. Fluorescence intensity of control cells (exposed to EGTA/ATP) was taken as 100%. Means obtained from triplicate samples, each containing at least 10,000 cells, are shown. Fluorescent images were obtained using a Leica confocal laser-scanning microscope attached to a Leitz Fluovert-FU microscope. Excitation was at 514 nm, and emission was collected with a >600-nm barrier filter. Digital images (equatorial optical slices) were displayed using the Leica “glowovun” look-up table. Each experiment (in duplicates or triplicates) was repeated, and the results were reproduced at least three times. A quantitative estimate of F-actin distribution changes was obtained by radial line scan analysis of the images of the equatorial slices (13Norman J.C. Price L.S. Ridley A.J. Hall A. Koffer A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1005-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Three radial scan lines were obtained per cell, each extending from the exterior to the center of the cell. To obtain the distribution plots, as displayed in Fig. 4, A and B, the lines obtained for each set of experimental conditions were averaged to form a mean profile ± S.E. (n > 50; the statistic is appropriate for the cell number and not the number of lines). For Fig. 4 C, integration of areas under the traces from regions designated as cortical and internal (pixels 1–10 and 11–35, respectively, representing 0–2.45 and 2.45–8.575 μm from the cell edge) produced data that were then expressed in the form of a bar chart. Changes in the cortical and internal regions were calculated as percentages of the total F-actin content in both regions from appropriate control cells (the sum of intensities of pixels 1–35 for EGTA-treated cells). Thus, relative changes in distribution of F-actin induced by calcium/ATP and/or V14RhoA could be evaluated. All figures shown are representative of at least three separate experiments (levels of secretion vary greatly between individual experiments, but the effects are reproducible). Where error bars are included, these are S.E. Where indicated, data were analyzed by unpaired, one-tailed Student's t tests using Instat® software. p values of <0.05 were taken as significant and those of <0.002 as extremely significant. After permeabilization, mast cells lose up to 70% of their total actin. The remaining F-actin is present mostly in the cell periphery, as a prominent subplasmalemmal network. Exposure of such permeabilized cells to calcium (pCa < 6) and ATP ([ATP] > 1 mm), induces a reduction of the cortical F-actin by 30–50%. Not all of the cells exposed to calcium/ATP are capable of the secretory response; two separate cell populations could be distinguished by flow cytometry (using light scatter characteristics and/or fluorescein isothiocyanate-succinyl-concanavalin A staining). Analysis of the cytoskeletal responses of these two populations revealed that the F-actin content of cells exposed to Ca/ATP is reduced in both secreting and nonsecreting cells (as reflected by the rhodamine-phalloidin fluorescence, not shown). Thus, F-actin loss occurs in both populations and is not sufficient to induce secretion. Calmodulin plays a crucial role in the calcium-induced loss of cortical F-actin; the latter is promoted by the addition of exogenous calmodulin and strongly inhibited by depletion of the endogenous calmodulin. None of these effects, however, are accompanied by any changes in the secretory responses, indicating that calmodulin is not required for the late steps in exocytosis.2 The proportion of secreting cells is enhanced by the addition of constitutively active mutants of both Rho (V14RhoA) and Rac (V12Rac1) and inhibited by a Rho inhibitor, C3 transferase (4Price L.S. Norman J.C. Ridley A.J. Koffer A. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 68-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The dominant inhibitory Rac protein, N17Rac1 does not have any significant effects on calcium-induced secretion (4Price L.S. Norman J.C. Ridley A.J. Koffer A. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 68-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This paper investigates whether the Rho-induced enhancement of secretion is associated with any changes in the cytoskeletal responses. Synergistic effects of calcium and GTP/GTPγS on secretion from streptolysin-O-permeabilized rat peritoneal mast cells are well established (12Howell T.W. Cockcroft S. Gomperts B.D. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To investigate whether Rho mimics GTPγS in this synergy, we have studied the effects of a constitutively active mutant of Rho, V14RhoA, and of a Rho inhibitor, C3 transferase, on the time course of and calcium requirements for secretion from suspended permeabilized cells. Fig. 1 Ashows that similarly to the effects of GTPγS, V14RhoA eliminated the delay in the onset of secretion, characteristic for the secretory response of permeabilized mast cells to calcium (20Koffer A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1176: 236-244Google Scholar). The extent of hexosaminidase release was also enhanced by both GTPγS and V14RhoA. C3, on the other hand, was inhibitory. GTPγS reduces calcium requirements of permeabilized mast cells for secretion, and again, similar effects were observed after the addition of V14RhoA (Fig. 1 B). In contrast to GTPγS, V14RhoA was unable to induce secretion in the absence of calcium. To test whether the effects of exogenous calmodulin require or are affected by the activity of Rho, we have pretreated permeabilized mast cells with C3 transferase prior to the addition of the exogenous calmodulin. The results are shown in Fig. 2. The C3 pretreatment inhibited both F-actin disassembly (Fig. 2 A) and secretion (Fig. 2 B). The sensitivity of the secretory response to C3 was, however, much greater than that of the cytoskeletal response. Relative to the responses of control cells, C3 (at 1 μg/ml) caused 20 ± 3% inhibition of F-actin disassembly and 83 ± 5% inhibition of secretion (n = 9). On the other hand, exogenous calmodulin (at 12 μm, a concentration that approximates its cytosolic level) had a marked effect on F-actin (Fig. 2 A) without affecting secretion (Fig. 2 B). Calcium/calmodulin-induced F-actin disassembly was still inhibited by C3, a small but a significant effect (Fig. 2 A). To test whether the Rho-induced enhancement of both calcium-dependent secretion and F-actin disassembly require the presence of calmodulin, we have used permeabilized cells depleted of this protein. Cells were pretreated with a calmodulin-inhibitory peptide (MLCKP), a specific 17-residue peptide based on the calmodulin-binding domain of myosin light chain kinase (17Torok K. Trentham D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12807-12820Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Such treatment depletes most of the endogenous calmodulin from the permeabilized cells.2 Responses of these calmodulin-depleted cells to calcium/ATP are shown in Fig. 2,C and D. MLCKP treatment prevented F-actin disassembly (Fig. 2 C) but not secretion (Fig. 2 D). Calmodulin-depleted cells were still responsive to the addition of V14RhoA (8 μg/ml); in both control and MLCKP-treated cells, V14RhoA enhanced calcium-induced secretion (Fig. 2 D) as well as F-actin loss (Fig. 2 C). V14RhoA-induced enhancement of F-actin disassembly was, however, much smaller than that induced by calmodulin (compare Fig. 2, compare A andC). Previous studies of mast cells exposed to GTPγS/EGTA did not reveal any involvement of Rho in regulation of cortical F-actin disassembly. Calcium-independent (i.e.GTPγS/EGTA-induced) cortical F-actin disassembly was neither inhibited by C3 transferase nor stimulated by V14RhoA (13Norman J.C. Price L.S. Ridley A.J. Hall A. Koffer A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1005-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The above data suggest that Rho may control cortical filaments in a calcium-dependent manner. To further examine the effects of Rho on F-actin morphology, we have used confocal microscopy. Fig. 3 shows confocal micrographs of glass-attached permeabilized cells stained with RP after their exposure to EGTA or calcium (postlabeled). Fig. 4,A and B, show line scan analyses of such images. Control cells (exposed to EGTA) exhibit prominent cortical F-actin (Fig. 3 A). Figs. 3 B and 4 B show the reduction of the cortical F-actin in cells exposed to calcium; the effect of C3 transferase (inhibition of this loss of F-actin) is shown in Fig. 3 D. In the absence of calcium, V14RhoA inducedde novo actin polymerization in the cell interior and only a very small reduction in the cortical F-actin (Figs. 3 E and4 A). In the presence of calcium, however, Rho enhanced cortical disassembly in addition to its effect on actin polymerization in the cell interior. This is shown in Figs. 3 F and4 B. Fig. 4 C shows a quantitative evaluation of the V14RhoA-induced changes in distribution of F-actin, expressed in the form of a bar chart. Relative changes in the levels of F-actin in the cortical (full bars) and the interior (hollow bars) regions are expressed as percentages of the total F-actin content in both regions of the control cells. The effects of V14RhoA on cortical F-actin disassembly are thus synergistic with or dependent upon calcium, while those on actin polymerization are calcium-independent. Synergistic effects of V14RhoA and calcium on cortical F-actin disassembly were confirmed by experiments with suspended cells, using flow cytometry (Fig. 5 A). For this experiment, cells were prelabeled with a low concentration of RP (0.1 μm) to determine the F-actin loss. This protocol does not interfere with the cytoskeletal responses of activated cells and avoids detection of any new filaments polymerized after cell activation (13Norman J.C. Price L.S. Ridley A.J. Hall A. Koffer A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1005-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The addition of V14RhoA to permeabilized mast cells prior to and during their exposure to Ca/ATP significantly enhanced the extent of cortical F-actin disassembly (left) as well as that of secretion (right). On the other hand, V14RhoA caused neither disassembly nor secretion in the absence of calcium (i.e. in 3 mm EGTA, not shown). Experiments with permeabilized mast cells, pretreated with increasing concentrations of unlabeled phalloidin, have shown that calcium-induced cortical actin disassembly is prevented at concentrations of phalloidin >1.5 μm. Secretion, however, was unaffected by these higher concentrations of phalloidin (not shown). We have used a similar protocol to investigate whether the secretion-enhancing effects of V14Rho are dependent on its disassembly-enhancing effects (Fig. 5 B). Cells were pretreated with 2 μm (unlabeled) phalloidin to stabilize the filaments and to prevent calcium-induced disassembly. After the exposure to calcium, cells were stained with RP to reveal any newly polymerized filaments. It is clear that F-actin cortex stabilization did not affect the ability of V14RhoA to enhance secretion (Fig. 5 B, right). The increase in F-actin content, apparent after the addition of V14RhoA, is the result of V14RhoA-induced de novo polymerization of actin (left). One of the downstream targets of Rho is a Rho-associated protein kinase, p160 ROCK . This enzyme was found to phosphorylate and so inactivate the myosin-binding subunit of myosin light chain phosphatase, leading to an increase in the level of phosphorylated myosin II light chain (MLC) (21Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 273: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2412) Google Scholar). To test whether cortical F-actin disassembly is regulated by Rho as a result of Rho controlling actomyosin-based contractility, we have used compound Y-27632, a specific p160 ROCK inhibitor (22Uehata M. Ishizaki T. Satoh H. Ono T. Kawahara T. Morishita T. Tamakawa H. Yamagami K. Inui J. Maekawa M. Narumiya S. Nature. 1997; 389: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (2507) Google Scholar). Fig. 6 A shows that Y-27632 had no effect on calcium-induced secretion and did not prevent its enhancement by V14RhoA. On the other hand, the Y compound had a marginal inhibitory effect on the calcium-induced cortical F-actin disassembly and caused a significant reduction of its V14RhoA-induced enhancement (Fig. 6 B). Compound Y-27632 had no effects on de novoactin polymerization (not shown). In the absence of calcium, GTPγS induces low levels of secretion that can be partially inhibited by a Rho inhibitor, C3 transferase, and only slightly stimulated by the addition of the constitutively active mutant of Rho, V14RhoA (4Price L.S. Norman J.C. Ridley A.J. Koffer A. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 68-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The addition of V14RhoA/EGTA to permeabilized mast cells does not, however, induce secretion (Fig. 1), indicating that in the absence of calcium, activation of Rho is not a sufficient trigger. GTPγS/EGTA also induces two cytoskeletal effects: de novoactin polymerization and cortical F-actin disassembly (4Price L.S. Norman J.C. Ridley A.J. Koffer A. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 68-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 13Norman J.C. Price L.S. Ridley A.J. Hall A. Koffer A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1005-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The former effect is completely inhibited by C3. Moreover, V14RhoA mimics this effect, inducing actin polymerization independently of calcium (Figs. 3 E and 4 A). Cytochalasin inhibits this localized increase in F-actin without affecting secretion (23Norman J.C. Price L.S. Ridley A.J. Koffer A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1429-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Although there is a clear correlation between actin polymerization and secretion, their control by Rho appears to proceed via two divergent signaling pathways. Since most of the soluble monomeric actin leaks out from the permeabilized cells, Rho seems to control recruitment of actin from a membrane-bound pool of actin monomers. Our evidence for the Rho-induced polymerization of actin contrasts with that of Machesky and Hall (24Machesky L.M. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 913-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). These authors concluded that Rho bundles actin filaments but does not induce polymerization; monomeric Cy3-labeled actin, microinjected into Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, was incorporated into lamellipodia, induced by activation of Rac, but not into stress fibers formed after Rho activation. This discrepancy could be explained by the existence of the suggested membrane-bound pool of monomeric actin from which Rho recruits monomers and in which Cy3-actin would not be included. GTPγS/EGTA-induced cortical F-actin disassembly is not significantly affected by C3 and thus seems to be independent of Rho activity. V14RhoA/EGTA does not induce F-actin loss (Figs. 3 E and4 A). This effect of GTPγS can be mimicked by AlF4−, an activator of heterotrimeric G-proteins (13Norman J.C. Price L.S. Ridley A.J. Hall A. Koffer A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1005-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Our preliminary results indicate that GTPγS/EGTA induces cortical F-actin disassembly via a Gi protein; the loss of F-actin is inhibited by pertussis toxin. 3R. Sullivan and A. Koffer, unpublished observations. Calcium/ATP-induced secretion is strongly inhibited by C3 transferase, implicating Rho in this response (4Price L.S. Norman J.C. Ridley A.J. Koffer A. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 68-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). While in the absence of calcium, V14RhoA was unable to mimic the effects of GTPγS on secretion, it had a strong secretion-enhancing effect in its presence (Figs. 1, 2 D, 5, and 6 A). V14RhoA reduced the requirements of permeabilized cells for calcium (Fig. 1 B) and abolished the delay in the onset of calcium-induced secretion. The rate-limiting step of calcium-induced secretion may therefore be a calcium-induced activation of the endogenous Rho. This could occur via calcium-sensitive Rho-GTPase-activating proteins (such as IQGAP (25Hart M.J. Callow M.G. Souza B. Polakis P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2997-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 26Brill S. Li S. Lyman C.W. Church D.M. Wasmuth J.J. Weissbach L. Bernards A. Snijders A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4869-4878Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) or class IX myosins (27Reinhard J. Scheel A.A. Diekmann D. Hall A. Ruppert C. Bahler M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 697-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar)) or via calcium-sensitive guanine nucleotide exchange factors (such as Vav (28Castresana J. Saraste M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 149-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) or those similar to guanine nucleotide-releasing factor for Ras, Ras-GRF (29Freshney N.W. Goonesekera S.D. Feig L.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar)) (seeX in the model, Fig. 7). Alternatively, calcium and ATP could work together to maintain GTP levels by transphosphorylating the endogenous GDP (as discussed in Ref.20Koffer A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1176: 236-244Google Scholar) and also included under X in the model, Fig. 7). Another explanation of the synergy with or the dependence upon calcium could be the existence of parallel signaling pathways from Rho and calcium that converge and act on a common target (see Y in the model, Fig. 7). In addition to controlling secretion and actin polymerization, Rho was found to have an additional role, that of promoting cortical F-actin disassembly. This role became apparent only in the presence of calcium: C3 transferase inhibited and V14RhoA promoted calcium-induced F-actin loss. The control of F-actin disassembly by Rho is, however, only partial. At 1 μg/ml, C3 inhibited secretion by ∼80%, while the disassembly was inhibited by only 20%. Another, Rho-independent, pathway to calcium-induced cortical F-actin disassembly must therefore exist. Our recent data point to the MLCK pathway: calcium-induced F-actin loss is greatly promoted by exogenous calmodulin and strongly inhibited by 1) calmodulin antagonists; 2) ML-7, a specific inhibitor of MLCK; and 3) 2,3-butanedione 2-monoxime, an uncompetitive, low affinity inhibitor of myosin MgATPase).2 Rho and calmodulin seem to act independently of each other, since the calmodulin effect on cortical disassembly was still apparent in the presence of C3 transferase (Fig. 2 A). Moreover, V14RhoA could induce a small but significant decrease in F-actin content in calmodulin-depleted cells (Fig. 2 C). Rho and calcium/calmodulin may control cortical actin disassembly by pathways that converge on myosin II light chain (see the model, Fig. 7). One of the targets of Rho, the Rho-associated protein kinase p160 ROCK, is involved in the control of myosin II light chain phosphorylation. This kinase phosphorylates the myosin-binding subunit of myosin light chain phosphatase, decreasing its activity (21Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 273: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2412) Google Scholar). In addition, the myosin-binding subunit of MLC phosphatase binds to Rho directly (21Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 273: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2412) Google Scholar). A further level of complexity is added by the finding that Rho kinase also phosphorylates MLC on Ser-19, the same site as that phosphorylated by MLCK (30Amano M. Ito M. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Chihara K. Nakano T. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20246-20249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar). Compound Y-27632, a specific p160 ROCK inhibitor (22Uehata M. Ishizaki T. Satoh H. Ono T. Kawahara T. Morishita T. Tamakawa H. Yamagami K. Inui J. Maekawa M. Narumiya S. Nature. 1997; 389: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (2507) Google Scholar), had a negligible effect on calcium-induced F-actin disassembly but significantly reduced its enhancement by V14RhoA (Fig. 6 B). This suggests that p160 ROCK participates in the regulation of actin cortex, but other targets of Rho may also be involved. Taken together, our data indicate that cortical F-actin disassembly is dependent on actomyosin-based contractility. Both calmodulin and Rho may induce an increase in MLC phosphorylation, leading to an increase in myosin activity and contractility. Calmodulin/MLCK-dependent, rather than Rho-dependent process, however, constitutes the major pathway to F-actin disassembly (see Fig. 7). The relevance of the cortical F-actin disassembly to secretion is still somewhat controversial. Prevention of F-actin disassembly by phalloidin does not affect either the secretion or secretion-enhancing effects of Rho (Fig. 5 B). Moreover, agents other than phalloidin (e.g. inhibitors of calmodulin and MLCK) also stabilize cortical filaments without affecting secretion (Fig. 2 D).2F-actin disassembly itself is not sufficient for secretion to occur: it is induced by calcium/ATP in both secreting and nonsecreting cell populations. An additional (presumably Rho/Rac-dependent) signal must, therefore, be necessary to initiate exocytosis. Thus, our results support a model with divergent signaling pathways to the cytoskeleton and to the late steps of exocytosis (23Norman J.C. Price L.S. Ridley A.J. Koffer A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1429-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). It is conceivable, however, that a great part of the observed cytoskeletal changes is physiologically relevant for responses of intact cells exposed to concentration gradients of stimuli: under such conditions, cell polarization and motility may play a crucial role before exocytosis is initiated. Moreover, stabilization of F-actin by jasplakinolide, a cell-permeant actin-specific agent (31Bubb M.R. Senderowicz A.M. Sausville E.A. Duncan K.L. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14869-14871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), inhibits secretion in intact, but not in permeabilized, cells. 4R. Sullivan and A. Koffer, unpublished results. This suggests actin involvement in the receptor activation-secretion coupling. In permeabilized cells, manipulation of the actin cytoskeleton by actin-binding proteins such as thymosin (32Muallem S. Kwiatkowska K. Xu X. Yin H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) or scinderin (33Zhang L. Marcu M.G. Nau Staudt K. Trifaro J.M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) induces changes in secretory responses. In mast cells, late steps of exocytosis were affected as a consequence of filament severing by gelsolin (14Borovikov Y.S. Norman J.C. Price L.S. Weeds A. Koffer A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 657-666PubMed Google Scholar). Whether this effect is related to the finding that gelsolin is a downstream effector of Rac (34Azuma T. Witke W. Stossel T.P. Hartwig J.H. Kwiatkowski D.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1362-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) remains to be established. Different specific pools of actin may be involved, controlling distinct steps of exocytosis. For example, a pool of filaments, closely associated with the plasma membrane and severed by exogenous gelsolin, may constitute a barrier to secretion. In contrast, those filaments that are more peripheral to the plasma membrane and undergo disassembly as a consequence of contraction do not appear to interfere with secretion. Our results are compatible with a model in which myosin-based contractility, activated by Rho and/or calcium/calmodulin, is required for the cortical F-actin disassembly, but this type of disassembly is not required for the late steps of exocytosis.

In addition to the C4 and CYP21 genes, at least nine other transcription units overlap the human C4 andC21 genes. XB encodes the extracellular matrix protein tenascin-X (19Morel Y. Bristow J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 12919-12924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); the ZA and ZB transcripts arise from promoters within intron 35 of the C4A and C4Bgenes and have the potential to encode a protein identical to the carboxyl-terminal 131 amino acids of C4 (25Tee M.K.

The three X transcripts are encoded on the DNA strand antisense to all the other transcripts and overlap the CYP21 and Y transcripts by several hundred bases and are transcribed in the same cells (20Bristow J.

Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1655-1665PubMed Google Scholar). The two C4 genes are expressed almost exclusively in the liver (27Martin H. Loos M. Sorg C. Macrophage-derived Cell Regulatory Factors: Cytokines. Karger, Basel, Switzerland1989: 155-172Google Scholar), and XB is expressed in a wide variety of tissues (20Bristow J. Tee M.K. Gitelman S.E.

Although the high frequency of 21-hydroxylase deficiency has stimulated intense study of human CYP21 genetics, less attention has been directed to the regulation of human CYP21transcription. Studies of the mouse CYP21A gene showed that a small promoter fragment of only 230–330 bases upstream from the transcriptional start site is sufficient to confer both basal and cAMP-induced transcription in mouse adrenal Y-1 cells (29Parker K.L.

These initial observations contributed to the discovery of the orphan nuclear receptor called SF-1 or Ad4-BP, which is required for the expression of steroidogenic enzymes in the adrenals and gonads (Refs. 34Morohashi K. Honda S. Inomata Y. Handa H. Omura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17913-17919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Lala D.S. Rice D.A. Parker K.L. Mol.

Rev. 1997; 18: 361-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). However, this proximal promoter region was necessary but not sufficient, as two small regions located 5.3 and 6.0 kb upstream from the mouse CYP21A gene were required for its expression in transgenic mice (38Milstone D.S. Shaw S.K. Parker K.L. Szyf M. Seidman J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21924-21927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments with the promoter of the human CYP21B gene similarly identified basal and cAMP-responsive elements within a 200-bp proximal promoter adjacent to the transcriptional start site (39Kagawa N. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11299-11305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Kagawa N. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11199-11204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but far upstream sequences have not been studied. We previously identified a 1-kb adrenal-specific transcript, operationally termed Z, that arises from a transcriptional start site in intron 35 of the human C4 gene, 55 bases upstream from the 5′ end of exon 36 of C4 and 4676 bases upstream from the cap site of CYP21B (25Tee M.K. Babalola G.O. Aza-Blanc P. Speek M. Gitelman S.E. Miller W.L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 2109-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The “Z promoter,” comprising as little as 235 bp upstream from the Z cap site, drove robust expression of a luciferase reporter when transfected into human adrenal NCI-H295 cells, but not when transfected into human placental JEG-3 cells, human liver HepG2 cells, or monkey kidney COS-1 cells (25Tee M.K. Babalola G.O. Aza-Blanc P. Speek M. Gitelman S.E. Miller W.L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 2109-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Because no function could be found for the Z transcript and because the Z promoter lies near to but upstream from the regions corresponding to the −5.3 and −6.0 regions of the mouse C21A gene tested by Milstone et al. (38Milstone D.S. Shaw S.K. Parker K.L. Szyf M. Seidman J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21924-21927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we suggested that the Z promoter is a component required for efficient adrenal-specific expression of the humanCYP21B gene (25Tee M.K. Babalola G.O. Aza-Blanc P. Speek M. Gitelman S.E. Miller W.L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 2109-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We have now confirmed this hypothesis by characterizing large segments of the human CYP21B promoter, identifying specific sites of DNA/protein interaction. A pWE15 human cosmid library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was screened under stringent conditions forC4/C21 sequences using a 372-bp PCR probe containing sequences from intron 35 of the C4-Z promoter region (−5254 to −4882 of the CYP21B gene) (Fig. 1). To isolate C4B/CYP21B clones, secondary screening was performed by PCR of primary clones using 21B specific oligonucleotides resulting in a 670-bp product (−64 to −729 ofCYP21B), which excluded amplification of CYP21Asequences. Positive cosmids were then digested with EcoRI and BamHI and hybridized with the 670-bp PCR probe. Positive DNA fragments were purified and used to assemble the constructs. The luciferase reporter constructs were built by cloning contiguous and internally deleted 5′-flanking DNA fragments of the CYP21Bgene extending from +13 bp to −9 kb (CYP21B transcription initiation site is designated as −1). These fragments were cloned upstream from the firefly luciferase reporter gene in the PGL3-Basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI) at various restriction sites within the polylinker. The constructs were named according to the approximate length of the DNA segment cloned from the CYP21B gene with the bases numbered according to the sequence of the humanC4A gene (18Yu C.Y. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 1057-1066PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Mutations were introduced into various functional elements by site-directed mutagenesis using a modification of the PCR protocol of Weiner et al. (41Weiner M.P. Costa G.L. Schoettlin W. Cline J. Mathur E. Bauer J.C. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 151: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Using 200 ng of wild type plasmid DNA as template, PCR was performed in reactions containing 500 μm dNTPs, 2 units of Pfu polymerase, and 250 ng each of the sense and antisense mutant oligos (Tm = 75 °C). The reaction conditions were: 95 °C for 30 s, followed by 20 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 65 °C for 25 min (2.5 min/kb DNA). PCR products were directly treated with 20 units of DpnI at 37 °C for 90 min, and the treated products used to transformEscherichia coli DH5α. To prevent the need for sequencing the resulting mutant clones in their entirety, restriction fragments encompassing the mutant regions were subcloned into the respective wild type constructs. Constructs used for heterologous promoter experiments consisted of single and multiple tandem copies of the wild type and mutant oligos used in the electrophoretic mobility shift assays (Table I) inserted upstream from an 86-bp fragment of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter (42McKnight S.L. Gavis E.R. Kingsbury R. Cell. 1981; 25: 385-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) extending from −32 to +55, lying immediately upstream from the firefly luciferase gene (HSV-TK32/Luc). Double-stranded oligonucleotides were blunt-end cloned into theSmaI site. The fidelity of all constructs was verified by restriction enzyme digestion and sequencing.Table IOligonucleotides used in this studyNameSequence−205/−177 wtGAACACGTCCATGATGCAAGACTCTGCTGCTTGTGCAGGTACTACTGTCTGAGACGAC−193/−188 MGAACACGTCCATACGTATAGACTCTGCTGCTTGTGCAGGTATGCATATCTGAGACGAC−162/−129 wtTGAAGACTGGGGCAAGGTCACCCTCTGGGAAGTGACTTCTGACCCCGTTCCAGTGGGAGACCCTTCAC−149/−144 MTGAAGACTGGGGCGCTTATACCCTCTGACTTCTGACCCCGCGAATATCGGAGAC−85/−66 P450sccGATCTGCAGGAGGAAGGACGTGAACGACGTCCTCCTTCCTGCACTTGCCTAG−155/−131 P450sccGATCTCGCTGCAGAAATTCCAGACTGAACCGAGCGACGTCTTTAAGGTCTGACTTGGCCTAG−447/−419 rat P450c17GTGTGACCTTATGCCGACTAACCTTTGAACACACTGGAATACGGCTGATTGGAAACTT−84/−55 rat P450c17CAAGAGATAACTCGACGTCAAGGTGACAAGTTCTCTAATGAGCTGCAGTTCCACTGTT−94/−119CTCTCAAAGCTGCTCCGCAAGGTCT−73/−51 wtCAGAATGAGAAGGACACTGGAGAGTCTTACACTTCCTGTGACCTCT−73/−51 MCAGAATGTAGCATCTGCTGGAGAGTCTTACATCGTAGACGACCTCT Open table in a new tab An adherent subline (NCI-H295A) (43Rodriguez H.

Mouse Y1 adrenal carcinoma cells (46Yasamura Y. Buonassisi V. Sato G.H. Cancer Res. 1966; 26: 529-535PubMed Google Scholar), a generous gift from Dr. B. Schimmer (University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada), were grown in 50% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)-H16:50% Ham's F12 with 15% heat-inactivated horse serum, 2.5% fetal bovine serum, and antibiotics. Monkey kidney COS-1 cells and human HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells were grown in DMEM-H21 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Human JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cells (47Kohler P.O. Bridson W.E. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1971; 65: 122-126Google Scholar) were grown in DMEM-H21 media supplemented with 5% horse serum and 0.2 mm gentamycin. Mouse MA-10 Leydig cells (48Ascoli M. Endocrinology. 1981; 108: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) were grown in Weymouth's medium supplemented with 15% horse serum, 2.5% HEPES buffer, and 0.2 mm gentamycin. All cell lines were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2. For transient transfection with the luciferase reporter constructs, cells were grown to 80% confluence in 10-cm Petri dishes and split into six-well plates 24 h prior to transfection. For the NCI-H295A cells, the DMEM-H16 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum was used for transfection and replaced with growth medium 12 h after transfection. Plasmid constructs used for transfection studies were purified using Qiagen columns (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Equal molar amounts of plasmid DNA containing varying lengths of contiguous and internally deletedCYP21B 5′-flanking DNA were transfected using the calcium phosphate-DNA co-precipitation method. Following incubation for 12 h, the medium was removed, and fresh medium was added and incubated for another 12 h. Cells were harvested and cellular extracts were assessed for luciferase activity by the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Transfection efficiencies were normalized by co-transfecting with the pRL-CMV plasmid (Promega) containing theRenilla luciferase gene driven by the CMV promoter. Luciferase activity values were normalized by initial division of all pRL-CMV-luciferase values by the lowest value obtained and the result used to divide the luciferase values obtained from the corresponding constructs. All constructs were transfected in triplicate, and the means of two independent experiments are shown. Nuclear extracts from NCI-H295A, JEG-3, COS-1, HepG2, MA-10, and Y1 cells were extracted using a method adapted from Dignam et al. (49Dignam J.D. Martin P.L. Shastry B.S. Roeder R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 582-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Double-stranded probes were prepared by hybridization of [32P]dATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) end-labeled complementary oligonucleotides (Table I). Mobility shift binding reactions typically contained 5–10 μg of nuclear extract and 40,000 cpm (less than 0.5 ng) of end-labeled double-stranded probe in a final buffer composition of 4% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mmDTT, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 50 mm or 100 mm KCl. Poly(dI-dC) (1 μg) was included as a nonspecific competitor in all reactions. When competitive binding studies were being performed, 5- 50 ng (10–100-fold excess) of unlabeled specific and nonspecific oligonucleotides were pre-mixed with the probe for 1–2 min prior to addition of the nuclear extract. The reactions were incubated for 15 min at room temperature and electrophoresed through an 8% native polyacrylamide gel in 50 mm Tris base, 0.38 mglycine, 2 mm EDTA and analyzed by autoradiography or phosphorimaging. SF-1 cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR of human adrenal RNA. cDNA was synthesized using 1 μg of random-primed RNA. Specific oligonucleotides designed at the 5′ and 3′ end of the gene to amplify the cDNA in the correct reading frame were used in a PCR reaction containing 2 mm MgCl2, 5% Me2SO, 200 μm dNTPs, 0.6 mmoligonucleotides, and 2.5 units of Pfu DNA polymerase. The 1.3-kb cDNA fragment was cloned into the BamHI-EcoRI site of the pCDNA3 vector (Stratagene). SF-1 protein was obtained by in vitro transcription and translation using the TnT T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system kit (Promega). 5 μl of lysate containing SF-1 protein or protein from lysate containing empty pCDNA3 vector were used in mobility shift assays. Probes were generated by PCR of the CYP21B −4.6 to −5.6 kb region using the C21/−5.0kb/Luc and C21/−5.6kb/Luc constructs as templates and [32P]dATP-end-labeled oligonucleotides. Both the −94 to −310 fragment from the C21/−5.0kb/Luc construct and the −717 to −937 fragment from the C21/−5.6kb/Luc construct were amplified using a vector-specific sense oligonucleotide. All other probes were obtained using the C21/−5.6kb/Luc construct. PCR products were purified using the Qiagen PCR purification kit and 70,000 cpm used in each assay. Probe DNA was incubated with varying concentrations of NCI-H295A and Y1 nuclear cell extracts (5–70 μg) in reactions containing 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 20 mm HEPES buffer, 10% glycerol, and 0.5 mm DTT. Poly(dI-dC) (1 μg) was included to prevent nonspecific DNA-binding proteins from binding to the labeled DNA. Reactions were incubated at 25 °C for 15 min, followed by the addition of 5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm MgCl2 and digestion with 0.1 units of DNase I. The reactions were terminated by adding 20 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 0.2 m NaCl, and 250 ng/ml yeast tRNA. Phenol/chloroform-purified and ethanol-precipitated products were resuspended in formamide loading buffer and separated by electrophoresis through an 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Dried gels were subjected to autoradiography. Southwestern blotting was done essentially as described (50Miskimins W.K. Roberts M.P. McClelland A. Ruddle F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The membranes were incubated in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 1 mmEDTA, 8% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 5% nonfat dry milk powder, and 10 μg/ml poly(dA-dT) for 1.5 h at 25 °C. The membranes were then transferred to hybridization buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 8% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, and 0.25% nonfat dry milk powder) containing 2 × 106 cpm/ml labeled probe for 2 h at 25 °C. The membranes were washed three times for 15 min each in hybridization buffer without probe at 25 °C and exposed to autoradiography or phosphorimaging. The 5′ upstream DNA for both the humanCYP21A and 21B genes is active, but expression from the 21A promoter occurs at only about 20% of the level of the 21B promoter (24Bristow J. Gitelman S.E.

https://openalex.org/W1983965482,"One of the essential protein substrates of geranylgeranyl transferase type I in the budding yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae is a rho-type GTPase, Rho1p, which is a regulatory subunit of 1,3-β-glucan synthase. Previous studies have indicated that modification of Rho1p is significantly reduced in a mutant of the β subunit of geranylgeranyl transferase type I calledcal1-1. Here we present genetic and biochemical evidence showing that modification of Rho1p is required for activity of 1,3-β-glucan synthase. The 1,3-β-glucan synthase activity of thecal1-1 membrane was significantly reduced compared with that of the wild-type membrane. The impaired activity was partly due to the reduced amount of Fks1p, a putative catalytic subunit of 1,3-β-glucan synthase, but also partly due to reduced affinity between unmodified Rho1p and Fks1p. GlutathioneS-transferase (GST)-Rho1 proteins with or without the C-terminal motif required for the modification were purified and used to analyze the interaction. The modified form of GST-Rho1p was specifically able to restore the 1,3-β-glucan synthase of therho1-3 membrane. Gel overlay analysis indicated that an unmodified form of GST-Rho1p fails to interact with Fks1p. These results indicated that the geranylgeranylation of Rho1p is a prerequisite to the assembly and activation of 1,3-β-glucan synthasein vitro. Increased cytoplasmic levels of divalent cations such as Ca2+ restored both Rho1p modification and the 1,3-β-glucan synthase activity of cal1-1, suggesting that cytoplasmic levels of the divalent cations affect geranylgeranyl transferase type I activity in vivo.

One of the well known modifications, protein prenylation, has been observed at the C terminus of a wide variety of cellular proteins, including members of Ras and Rho small GTPase, the γ subunit of G-protein, nuclear lamin, and yeast a-factor. Three distinct enzymes catalyze these reactions. Farnesyl transferase transfers the C-15 farnesyl, and geranylgeranyl transferase type I (GGTase I)1 and type II (GGTase II) transfer the C-20 geranylgeranyl. Among these enzymes, farnesyl transferase and GGTase I have similar properties; they are composed of an α/β heterodimer with a common α subunit, and their recognition motif is highly conserved. Proteins that are prenylated by these enzymes contain a C-terminal CAAX recognition sequence, where C is cysteine, A is an aliphatic amino acid, andX is any amino acid. The cysteine residue is the site of prenylation, and the last amino acid is the primary determinant of each enzyme. Farnesyl transferase preferentially prenylates the CAAX-containing proteins, whose X is methionine, serine, cysteine, glutamine, or alanine, whereas GGTase I preferentially prenylates them if X is leucine (1Finegold A.A.

Both farnesyl transferase and GGTase I are Mg2+-requiring, Zn2+metalloenzymes that require Mg2+ for isoprenoid transfer and Zn2+ for binding of the protein substrate (9Moomaw J. Casey P.J. J. Biol.

GGTase II shows slightly different properties. GGTase II modifies Rab/Ypt proteins at the C-terminal first or second cysteine. Although GGTase II is composed of catalytic α/β subunits, this catalytic core lacks the ability to bind Rab/Ypt proteins efficiently, and therefore the Rab escort protein is also necessary for the activation (12Seabra M.C.

It is noted that two mutants of β subunit of GGTase I, cal1-1 andcdc43-5, exhibited different substrate specificity. Incal1-1 cells, the proportion of Rho1p in a soluble fraction increased dramatically, but the localization of Cdc42p was not affected by cal1-1. On the other hand, in cdc43-5 cells, Cdc42p but not Rho1p was observed in a soluble fraction (22Ohya Y. Caplin B.E. Qadota H. Tibbetts M.F. Anraku Y. Pringle J.P. Marshall M.S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In addition, the ts lethality of cal1-1 was suppressed by the overexpression of RHO1, and that ofcdc43-5 was suppressed by the overexpression ofCDC42 (22Ohya Y. Caplin B.E. Qadota H. Tibbetts M.F. Anraku Y. Pringle J.P. Marshall M.S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). These results suggested that modification of Rho1p and Cdc42p are specifically impaired in cal1-1 andcdc43-5, respectively. Rho1p, a yeast homolog of mammalian rhoA, regulates cell morphogenesis and cell wall integrity through the transfer of specific signals via effector proteins (23Cabib E. Drgonava J. Drgon T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 307-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Four effectors (or potential effectors) of Rho1p were identified so far (Pkc1p, 1,3-β-glucan synthase, Bni1p, and Skn7p). Pkc1p, which is a yeast homolog of mammalian protein kinase C, was first identified as a protein that interacts with Rho1p (24Nonaka H. Tanaka K. Hirano H. Fujiwara T. Kohno H. Umikawa M. Mino A.

Rho1p was identified as the regulator of 1,3-β-glucan synthase (GS) (26Qadota H. Python C.P. Inoue S.B. Arisawa M. Anraku Y. Zheng Y. Watanabe T. Levin D.E. Ohya Y.

Perez P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4584-4591Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Bni1p also interacts with Act1p, yeast actin, and Pfy1p, yeast profilin; thus suggesting that Rho1p regulates yeast morphogenesis through Bni1p (30Kohno H. Tanaka K. Mino A. Umikawa M. Imamura H.

Skn7p is a transcription factor that has recently been shown to bind to Rho1p (31Alberts A.S. Bouquin N. Johnston L.H. Treisman R. J. Biol.

In this study, we genetically investigate the roles of geranylgeranylation in Rho1p function with a conditional lethal mutant of GGTase I. We also biochemically examine the activity of modified and unmodified forms of Rho1p directly by using recombinant proteins expressed in insect cells. Our results indicate that geranylgeranylation of Rho1p is required for both assembly and activity of GS. Escherichia coliDH5α (Toyobo) was used for the preparation of plasmids.

All strains were cultured in YPD containing 2% glucose (Wako Chemicals), 2% Bacto Pepton (Difco), 1% Bacto yeast extract (Difco) at 23 °C or room temperature. In some cases, YPD with 50 mm CaCl2, 100 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, or 3 mm MnCl2 was used. To measure the GS activity, the membrane fraction was prepared as described previously (33Inoue S.B. Takewaki N.

Briefly, cells (1- or 2-liter cultures) were grown at 23 °C to early log phase and were harvested. Cells suspended with 1 mm EDTA, 500 mm NaCl, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were lysed on ice with glass beads and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min. The cell lysate was ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was suspended in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 33% glycerol and used as a membrane fraction. The GS activity was measured according to the procedure described previously (33Inoue S.B. Takewaki N. Takasuka T. Mio T. Adachi M. Fujii Y. Miyamoto C. Arisawa M. Furuichi Y. Watanabe T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 845-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, the reaction mixture (50 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm KF, 1 mmEDTA, 0.2 mm UDP-glucose (20,000 cpm of UDP-[G-14C]glucose; NEN Life Science Products) and 10 μl of a membrane fraction. The reaction was performed at room temperature for 30 min either in the presence or absence of 4 μm GTPγS. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 ml of cold 5% trichloroacetic acid, and the mixture was filtered through glass membrane filters. The radioactivity trapped on the filter was measured with Top Counter (Packard Instrument Co.). For the reconstitution experiments using the rho1-3 membrane fraction, a small amount (1 or 2 μl) of the Rho1p fraction was added to the rho1-3 membrane fraction and preincubated for 10 min at room temperature before starting the reaction. RHO1 open reading frame fragment of pYO702 was cloned into pVL1393. The resulting pVL-RHO1 andBsu36I-digested BacPAK6 (CLONTECH) were transfected with CellfectinTM reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instruction manual.Trichoplusia ni cells (Invitrogen: HIGH FIVETMcells) were infected with recombinant viruses and then cultured for 3 days at 25 °C. The preparation of recombinant Rho1p from insect cells was described elsewhere (34Yamamoto T. Kaibuchi K. Mizuno T. Hiroyoshi M. Shirataki H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16626-16634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, infected cells were harvested, suspended in homogenizing buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and lysed by sonication. The homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 60 min at 4 °C. The membrane fraction was suspended in a TEDMC1.0 buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1% CHAPS, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The CHAPS concentration of the supernatant was adjusted to 0.6% by the addition of TEDM buffer, and the solution was applied to a column of Mono-Q (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that had been equilibrated with TEDMC0.6 buffer. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min. After the sample was applied to the column, it was washed with 10 ml of TEDMC0.6 buffer and eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0–500 mm) in TEDMC0.6 buffer. The fractions containing Rho1p were identified by both Western blotting, using rabbit anti-Rho1p antisera, and by measurement of the GS activation using therho1-3 membrane fraction. The GST fusion proteins were prepared as described below. TheEcoRI-BglII fragment of pYO710 containing theRHO1Q68L open reading frame was inserted into pBacGST, the resulting pBacGST-RHO1Q68L was transformed into DH10Bac (Life Technologies, Inc.), and the bacmid containing the baculo virus genome was prepared according to the manufacturer's manual. The pBacGST-RHO1Q68LC206S was constructed by polymerase chain reaction using UlTma DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer). Two primers (primer1, 5′-GGGGAATTCATGTCACAACAAGTTGG-3′, and primer 2, 5′-GGGGTCGACTATAACAAGACTGACTTC-3′, in which underlines show the EcoRI and SalI site, respectively) were used. Rho1pQ68L was prepared from the detergent extract of the membrane fraction, and Rho1pQ68LC206S was prepared from the soluble fraction. Both recombinant proteins were purified by chromatography with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manual. The eluted fraction was further purified by Mono-Q column chromatography. Total RNAs from YPH500,cal1-1, and rho1-3 cells were isolated as described previously (35Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P.

The probe for FKS1was prepared by polymerase chain reaction with primers 5′-GCGGATCCATTATGACCCAAATGCTATCGC-3′ and 5′-GCGTCGACACCAAATGTAACTAAGTACGGG-3′. The probe forYEF3 used as an internal control was theEcoRI-XhoI fragment of p99-YEF3 (37Nagahashi S. Nakayama H. Hamada K. Yang H. Arisawa M. Kitada K. Mol. Gen.

Briefly, yeast cells were grown at 23 °C to mid-log phase, harvested, suspended in 0.1 ml of lysis buffer (0.8 m sorbitol, 1 mmEDTA, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and lysed on ice by vortexing with glass beads. Greater than 80% lysis was confirmed by light microscopy. After the addition of 0.4 ml of lysis buffer, lysates were spun at 800 × g for 1 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then spun at 436,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was resuspended in the same volume (0.5 ml) of lysis buffer. Samples (10 μl) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). The Western blot analysis was performed with rabbit anti-Rho1p antisera. The ligand overlay experiment was performed as described previously (38Ishizaki T. Maekawa M. Fujisawa K. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Fujita A. Watanabe N. Saito Y. Kakizuka A. Morii N. Narumiya S.

Briefly, the partially purified 1,3-β-glucan synthase (2 μg) of S. cerevisiae was subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 5 to 20% gradient gel and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The proteins on the membrane were denatured by agitating the membrane for 10 min in buffer C (25 mm Mes-NaOH, pH 6.5, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.05 mm ZnCl2, 0.05% Triton X-100) containing 6 m guanidium hydrochloride, which was then diluted with an equal volume of buffer C. The denatured proteins on the membrane were renatured by agitating the membrane overnight in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mmMgCl2, 0.05 mm ZnCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% phosphatidylcholine, and 0.1% CHAPS. The membrane was washed three times with 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mNaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm EDTA. The membrane was then reacted at room temperature for 30 min and then at 4 °C for 10 min with [35S]GTPγS-labeled GST-Rho1pQ68L and GST-Rho1pQ68LC206S, respectively. The labeling reaction was performed by incubating 2 μg of GST-Rho1p with [35S]GTPγS (1.25 pmol, 1,000 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) for 60 min at 30 °C. The reacted membrane was washed four times with 25 mmMes-NaOH, pH 6.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, and 0.05% Triton X-100, dried, exposed to an imaging plate, and analyzed with a Bio Imaging Analyzer, model BAS 1000 Mac (Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd.). Rho1p, a regulatory subunit of GS, contains a consensus motif that can be modified by GGTase I (15Ohya Y. Goebl M. Goodman L.E. Petersen-Bjorn S. Friesen J.D. Tamanoi F. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12356-12360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Modification of Rho1p is impaired in cal1-1, a temperature-sensitive mutant of the β subunit of GGTase I (22Ohya Y. Caplin B.E. Qadota H. Tibbetts M.F. Anraku Y. Pringle J.P. Marshall M.S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) that accumulates unmodified Rho1p in the cytosolic fraction. As the first step toward examining whether posttranslational modification of Rho1p is important for GS activity, we measured the GS activity of the membrane prepared from the cal1-1 strain. We found that the membrane fractions of cal1-1 cells exhibited a dramatic reduction of GS activity (Fig. 1). Another allele of cal1-1, cdc43-5 resulted in impairment of the Cdc42p modification but has preserved normal modification activity of Rho1p (22Ohya Y. Caplin B.E. Qadota H. Tibbetts M.F. Anraku Y. Pringle J.P. Marshall M.S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). As a result, no significant reduction of the GS activity was observed in the cdc43-5membrane (Fig. 1). We next examined whether wild-type,cal1-1, and cdc43-5 strains were sensitive to echinocandin B, which is a known inhibitor of GS (Table I). The sensitivity of cal1-1was 4–5-fold higher than that of the wild type. In contrast,cdc43-5 showed similar sensitivity to the inhibitor. These results suggested that unmodified Rho1p results in decreased GS activity in vivo.Table IThe echinocandin B sensitivity of some mutantsStrainIC50μg/mlWild type (YPH500)2.20 ± 0.15cal1-10.49 ± 0.05cdc43-51.60 ± 0.23rho1-31.04 ± 0.23Δfks10.24 ± 0.09 Open table in a new tab To examine whether impaired GS activity in cal1-1 was due to decreased activity of unmodified Rho1p, we examined whether recombinant Rho1p restored the reduced GS activity of the cal1-1membrane. As Qadota et al. (26Qadota H. Python C.P. Inoue S.B. Arisawa M. Anraku Y. Zheng Y. Watanabe T. Levin D.E. Ohya Y. Science. 1996; 272: 279-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) showed previously, impaired GS activity of the rho1-3 membrane is fully restored by the addition of recombinant Rho1p expressed by insect cells (Fig. 2 A) (26Qadota H. Python C.P. Inoue S.B. Arisawa M. Anraku Y. Zheng Y. Watanabe T. Levin D.E. Ohya Y. Science. 1996; 272: 279-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). However, when recombinant Rho1p was added to the membrane fraction ofcal1-1, only partial restoration (up to half) the amount of the wild type was observed (Fig. 2 A). This suggested that components other than Rho1p are irreversibly damaged incal1-1. Since the only GS component thus far known is the putative catalytic subunit, Fks1p, we next analyzed the protein level of Fks1p in the wild type and cal1-1. Western blot analysis indicated that the amount of Fks1p in cal1-1 was significantly reduced (Fig. 2 C). The rho1-3mutant exhibited a normal amount of Fks1p. Northern blot analysis of the FKS1 transcript showed that no significant differences were observed between the wild-type and cal1-1 cells (Fig. 2 B). Taken together, these results imply that impaired GS activity in cal1-1 was partially due to decreased protein stability of the catalytic subunit, Fks1p. Reduced GS activity in the cal1-1 cells suggested that geranylgeranylation of Rho1p is required for the GS activity in vivo. To examine whether the modification of Rho1p is directly required for the activation of GS, we analyzed the ability of modified and unmodified form of Rho1p to restore impaired GS activity of the rho1-3 membrane. C-terminal modified (Rho1pQ68L) and unmodified (Rho1pQ68LC206S) forms of Rho1p were expressed in insect cells as GST fusion proteins. The modified (Rho1pQ68L) and unmodified (Rho1pQ68LC206S) proteins were predominantly recovered in the membrane and cytosolic fraction, respectively, of infected cells. Both proteins were then purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B and Mono-Q column chromatography (Fig. 3 A). A Q68L mutation was used because this mutation results in constitutively active Rho1p. We found that the addition of unmodified (Q68LC206S) Rho1p in amounts of up to 8.0 μg of protein showed no ability to restore the impaired GS activity (data not shown). The addition of either 0.06 μg of Rho1pQ68L or 0.06 μg of Rho1pQ68L and Rho1pQ68LC206S proteins, however, resulted in full activation of GS, indicating that this amount of Rho1pQ68LC206S contained no inhibitor activity (Fig. 3 B). Thus these results implied that unmodified Rho1p fails to activate GSin vitro. A ligand overlay assay with Candida albicans Rho1p has shown that yeast Rho1p can directly bind to the Candida homolog of Fks1p (39Kondoh O. Tachibana Y. Ohya Y. Arisawa M. Watanabe T. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7734-7741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this experiment, we analyzed the ability of unmodified Rho1p to bind Fks1p. Rho1pQ68L and Rho1pQ68LC206S were radiolabeled with [35S]GTPγS and used for blotting on the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane onto which purified GS had been immobilized following SDS-PAGE. Binding of modified Rho1p (Rho1pQ68L) was observed at the position of Fks1p, but no signal was observed when the unmodified Rho1p (Q68LC206S) was used (Fig. 4). These results indicated that unmodified Rho1p fails to interact with Fks1p. The cal1-1 mutant was originally isolated as a temperature-sensitive mutant resulting in a Ca2+-dependent phenotype; it grows well in Ca2+-rich medium containing 100 mmCaCl2 but not in YPD containing 200 μmCaCl2 at 37 °C (40Ohya Y. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 193: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It was also able to grow in a medium containing 3 mm MnCl2 (Fig. 5 A). Biochemical analysis of GGTase I indicated that the enzyme requires Zn2+ for its activity, and Ca2+ and Mn2+ can substitute for Zn2+. We therefore examined whether membrane localization of Rho1p and the GS activity in the cal1-1 cells were perturbed by divalent cations in the medium. When cal1-1cells were cultured in YPD at 23 °C, Rho1p was mainly accumulated in the soluble fraction with modified and unmodified forms. But when these cells were cultured in YPD with 100 mm CaCl2 or YPD with 3 mm MnCl2 at 23 °C, Rho1p was observed both in soluble and insoluble fraction, and most Rho1p was observed in as the modified form (Fig. 5 B). Moreover,cal1-1 cells cultured in YPD with 3 mmMnCl2 showed a significant recovery of GS activity (Fig. 5 C). These results are consistent with early observations that external divalent cations can affect the cal1-1phenotype. Wild-type and cal1-1 cells cultured in YPD with 100 mm CaCl2, however, exhibited significantly decreased GS activity (Fig. 5 C). This may be because high Ca2+ concentrations would cause unknown damages to GS or to the plasma membrane (see “Discussion”). Since cytoplasmic Ca2+ is sequestered into vacuole (41Anraku Y. Umemoto N. Hirata R. Ohya Y. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 395-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), avma1 mutation of a catalytic subunit of vacuolar H+-ATPase resulted in an elevated concentration of intracellular Ca2+ (33Inoue S.B. Takewaki N. Takasuka T. Mio T. Adachi M. Fujii Y. Miyamoto C. Arisawa M. Furuichi Y. Watanabe T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 845-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 42Halachmi D. Eilam Y. FEBS Lett. 1993; 316: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We showed here that thevma1 mutation suppressed cal1-1. The temperature-sensitive growth phenotype of cal1-1 was suppressed by vma1. Also, population of Rho1p in the membrane fraction increased in the cal1-1/vma1cells (data not shown). The cal1-1/vma1cells showed a significant restoration (from ∼35–70%) in GS activity (Fig. 6). These results suggest that impaired Rho1p geranylgeranylation in cal1-1 was restored by the increase of cytoplasmic Ca2+concentration. In this report, we show that the geranylgeranylation of Rho1p has a critical role in the activation of GS. First, the GS activity was dramatically impaired in cal1-1 mutant, which is defective in modification of Rho1p. Second, in the reconstitution experiments with GST-Rho1 proteins, the modified (Q68L) but not the unmodified (Q68LC206S) Rho1p could restore the GS activity of rho1-3membrane. Third, in the ligand overlay experiments with GST-Rho1 proteins, the modified Rho1p could specifically bind to Fks1p, a putative catalytic subunit of GS, but the unmodified Rho1p could not. Taken together, these results suggest that the geranylgeranylation of Rho1p would be prerequisite to both binding to Fks1p and the activation of GS. Recently, Illenberger et al. (43Illenberger D. Schwald F. Pimmer D. Binder W. Maier G. Dietrich A. Gierschik P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6241-6249Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) demonstrate that the geranylgeranylation of mammalian Cdc42Hs and Rac1 is prerequisite for the stimulation of phospholipase C-β2. It is also shown that the geranylgeranylation of rhoA is necessary for the association with phospholipase C-α and the resulting activation of AP-1 transcription (44Chang J.-H. Pratt J.C. Sawasdikosol S. Kapeller R. Burakoff S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4986-4993Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These findings clearly demonstrated that the geranylgeranylation of rho-type small GTPase is prerequisite to the activation of effector proteins. There has been indirect evidence suggesting that unmodified Rho1p has less activity toward GS in fission yeast (45Arellano M. Coll P.M. Yang W. Duran A. Tamanoi F. Perez P. Mol. Miocrobiol. 1998; 29: 1357-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Our results reported here show the importance of Rho1p geranylgeranylation for both the binding to Fks1p and the activation of GS. Therefore, GS is the first effector of rho GTPase, which shows that the geranylgeranylation of rho GTPase is prerequisite to both binding and activation. So far, Pkc1p, Bni1p, and Skn7p were also identified as protein targets of Rho1p (24Nonaka H. Tanaka K. Hirano H. Fujiwara T. Kohno H. Umikawa M. Mino A. Takai Y.

The interaction between Rho1p and each protein was shown by two-hybrid assays with an unmodified form of Rho1p (24Nonaka H. Tanaka K. Hirano H. Fujiwara T. Kohno H. Umikawa M. Mino A. Takai Y. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5931-5938Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 30Kohno H. Tanaka K. Mino A. Umikawa M. Imamura H. Fujiwara T. Fujita Y. Hotta K. Qadota H. Watanabe T. Ohya Y. Takai Y.

Chem. 1998; 273: 8616-8622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The in vitro interaction between Rho1p and Pkc1p was also shown by immunoprecipitation (25Kamada Y. Qadota H. Python C.P. Anraku Y. Ohya Y. Levin D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9193-9196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) with geranylgeranylated Rho1p. Moreover, the associations of another rho-type small GTPase, Cdc42p, to its effectors, Ste20p and Cla4p, were also revealed by the yeast two-hybrid assay (46Simon M.N. De Virgilio C. Souza B. Pringle J.R. Abo A. Reed S.I. Nature. 1995; 376: 702-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 47Cvrckova F. De Virgilio C. Manser E. Pringle J.R. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1817-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). It is likely that no geranylgeranylation is necessary for the binding to these effectors. It is still unknown, however, whether the geranylgeranylation would facilitate the binding to effectors and activate effectors or not. We tried to identify the interaction site between Rho1p and Fks1p by the yeast two-hybrid assay with unmodified Rho1p but could detect no obvious interactions (data not shown). Our present results suggest that the geranylgeranylation of Rho1p is prerequisite to both the association to Fks1p and the activation of GS. Thus, the yeast two-hybrid assay could not elucidate all protein-protein interactions, especially for proteins that are modified posttranslationally, although this method is still powerful for the detection of many protein-protein interactions. Therefore, some proteins may be detected as rho GTPase effectors because their interactions could not be detected by the yeast two-hybrid assay. Furthermore, it is a remaining possibility that the geranylgeranyl residue of Rho1p would have an important role in the efficient binding to effectors and the activation of effectors. The impaired GS activity of cal1-1 would result from the reduced amount of Fks1p (Fig. 2 C) but not the decreased mRNA level of FKS1 (Fig. 2 B). These results imply that Fks1p is easily degraded when it does not bind Rho1p. Fks1p is synthesized on the membrane-bound ribosome and transported to the plasma membrane through the secretory pathway. Therefore, it is possible that Rho1p-unbound Fks1p is targeted to vacuole instead of the plasma membrane in the cal1-1 cells and is degraded in vacuole. It is also likely that the degradation of Rho1p-unbound Fks1p is facilitated. It is known that some plasma membrane proteins are subject to rapid degradation triggered by the change of environmental conditions. For instance, the yeast zinc transporter Ztp1p is internalized and degraded in the vacuole when cells are exposed to excess Zn2+ (48Gitan R.S. Luo H. Rodgers J. Broderius M. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28617-28624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The uracil permease Fur4p is also degraded in the vacuole by the signal of nutrient starvation (49Volland C. Urban-Grimal D. Geraud G. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9833-9841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, Rho1p-unbound Fks1p may be internalized and degraded in the vacuole. Previous observations showed that Rho1p and Fks1p were co-localized at the site of cell wall remodeling in a cell cycle-dependent manner (26Qadota H. Python C.P. Inoue S.B. Arisawa M. Anraku Y. Zheng Y. Watanabe T. Levin D.E. Ohya Y. Science. 1996; 272: 279-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). If degradation of Fks1p is facilitated by dissociation of Rho1p, this could further assist in the restricted localization of Fks1p on the plasma membrane. In this report, we observed impaired GS activities when yeast cells were cultured in YPD with 50 mm or 100 mmCaCl2, (Fig. 5). These results might be observed as a consequence of the higher extracellular Ca2+ concentration. The higher Ca2+ concentration would cause the unknown critical damage to the plasma membrane and/or GS itself. Besides the effect of relatively high concentrations of extracellular Ca2+, intracellular Ca2+ in the submicromolar range has been known to have various critical roles for living cells. In budding yeast, previous genetic and biochemical studies have indicated that many gene products are involved in the protein families that are regulated by Ca2+. The β subunit of GGTase I, Cal1p/Cdc43p, is one of these proteins. According to our results, Cal1p/Cdc43p regulates the GS activity through Rho1p geranylgeranylation. Thus, Ca2+ may regulate the cell wall remodeling. Furthermore, Ohya et al. (50Ohya Y. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1986; 132: 979-988PubMed Google Scholar) isolated several calcium-sensitive (cls) mutants. Among them, CLS4is identical to CDC24, which encodes the guanine-nucleotide exchange factor for Cdc42p (51Ohya Y. Miyamoto S. Ohsumi Y. Anraku J. Bacteriol. 1986; 165: 28-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and CLS5 is identical toPFY1, which encodes yeast profilin. Calmodulin plays central roles especially in the mating morphogenetic signaling process (52Moser M.J. Geiser J.R. Davis T.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4824-4831Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar,53Okano H. Cyert M.S. Ohya Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26375-26382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These proteins are involved in determining the cell polarity and in cell wall remodeling. Taken together, the intracellular concentration of Ca2+ may regulate yeast cell morphology mediated by these proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2066892858,"The C-terminal domains of yeast structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) proteins were previously shown to bind double-stranded DNA, which generated the idea of the antiparallel SMC heterodimer, such as the SMC1/3 dimer, bridging two DNA molecules. Analysis of bovine SMC1 and SMC3 protein domains now reveals that not only the C-terminal domains, but also the coiled-coil region, binds DNA, while the N terminus is inactive. Duplex DNA and DNA molecules with secondary structures are highly preferred substrates for both the C-terminal and coiled-coil domains. Contrasting other cruciform DNA-binding proteins like HMG1, the SMC3 C-terminal and coiled-coil domains do not bend DNA, but rather prevent bending in ring closure assays. Phosphatase, exonuclease, and ligase assays showed that neither domain renders DNA ends inaccessible for other enzymes. These observations allow modifications of models for SMC-DNA interactions."

The molecular mechanisms that function to integrate these diverse processes are largely unknown, but in some cases appear to involve multifunctional proteins capable of associating with regulatory sequences in both DNA and RNA. In Xenopus for example, FRGY2 was originally identified as an oocyte-specific transcription factor that associates with a DNA regulatory element termed the Y-box (1Wolffe A.P. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). However, recent studies have shown that FRGY2 also functions to repress mRNA translation, in part, by binding to a specific mRNA sequence motif (2Matsumoto K. Meric F. Wolffe A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22706-22712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Thus, expression of FRGY2 leads to both increased transcription from promoters containing a Y-box and translational silencing of the mRNA transcripts (3Tafuri S.R. Wolffe A.P. New Biol. 1992; 4: 349-359PubMed Google Scholar, 4Tafuri S.R. Wolffe A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24255-24261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, MSY1, the mouse homologue of FRGY2, has been proposed to have dual roles in activating germ cell-specific transcription in the testis and translational repression of the resulting mRNA (5Tafuri S.R. Familari M. Wolffe A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12213-12220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both situations are reminiscent of the dual role of transcription factor IIIA in the synthesis and storage of 5 S rRNA in the Xenopus oocyte (6Pelham H.R.B. Brown D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 4170-4174Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar).Evidence also exists to suggest that pre-mRNA splicing may be coupled to transcription, in part, through common regulatory proteins. In yeast, the group I intron splicing stimulatory protein, Cbp2, has been reported to enhance transcription of the mitochondrial COB gene (7Lewin A.S. Thomas Jr., J. Tirupati H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6971-6978Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), while in higher organisms, an apparent pre-mRNA splicing factor, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K, has been shown to stimulate RNA polymerase II transcription in vitro and to activate and repress transcription in vivo (8Tomonaga T.

These proteins, recently identified as the mouse Y-box protein, MSY1 (13Kelm Jr., R.J. Cogan J.G. Elder P.K. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. J. Biol.

Interestingly, an inspection of the complete VSM α-actin cDNA and genomic sequences revealed an exon 3-derived sequence with strong similarity to the 5′ PE (16Kelm Jr., R.J. Sun S. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24278-24285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This sequence, termed the coding element (CE), encoded amino acids 44–53 of the mature protein, exhibited a similar degree of purine-pyrimidine asymmetry, and lay immediately adjacent to the 3′ end of intron 2. Unlike the PE, the double-stranded form of the CE exhibited no detectable affinity for transcription enhancer factor 1, despite the presence of an inverted MCAT-like motif, nor did the isolated pyrimidine-rich strand exhibit detectable affinity for MSY1, then termed VACssBF1 (16Kelm Jr., R.J. Sun S. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24278-24285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, Purα and Purβ, then termed the C and D components of VACssBF2, interacted equally well with the purine-rich strands of both the 5′ PE and the exon 3-derived CE (16Kelm Jr., R.J. Sun S. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. J. Biol.

These studies were prompted, in part, by the aforementioned ability of Y-box proteins to bind RNA (5Tafuri S.R. Familari M. Wolffe A.P. J. Biol.

Our results indicate that RNA binding of all three proteins is sequence-specific and does not appear to require protein-protein interaction. Moreover, mutational analyses of mouse Purβ indicate that the determinants of ssDNA, mRNA, and protein binding differ from each other and from those previously reported for human Purα. These findings suggest that MSY1, Purα, and Purβ may be multifunctional regulators of VSM α-actin gene expression by virtue of specifically interacting with both DNA and RNA regulatory elements.DISCUSSIONEarlier analyses of mouse vascular smooth muscle α-actin gene transcription in fibroblasts and undifferentiated myoblasts led to the formulation of a molecular model in which the activity of an essential, transcription enhancer factor 1-dependent, MCAT enhancer element located within a polypurine-polypyrimidine tract (−165 to −195) was subject to negative regulation by sequence-specific, ssDNA-binding proteins (15Sun S.

It was later discovered that the purine-rich strand binding activity, then termed vascularactin single-stranded DNA-binding factor 2 (VACssBF2), also interacted specifically with the sense strand of a protein-coding element (CE) sequence bearing similarity to the 5′ promoter element (PE) sequence (16Kelm Jr., R.J.

This CE sequence was located at the 5′ end of exon 3 and encoded amino acids 44–53 of VSM α-actin. The sense strand of the CE sequence was subsequently used to screen a mouse lung cDNA expression library and to isolate clones encoding the purine-rich strand-binding proteins, Purα and Purβ (14Kelm Jr., R.J.

DNA-binding analyses of Purα and Purβ expressed in mouse fibroblasts confirmed that these proteins were identical to the p46 and p44 components of VACssBF2 (14Kelm Jr., R.J. Elder P.K. Strauch A.R.

More recently, we employed the same binding site screening strategy to identify the mouse Y-box protein, MSY1, as VACssBF1 (13Kelm Jr., R.J. Cogan J.G. Elder P.K. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. J. Biol.

Biochemical studies conducted with peptide-specific polyclonal antibodies confirmed that fibroblast-derived Purα/Purβ and MSY1 specifically bind to opposite strands of the MCAT containing PE sequence and revealed that Purα and Purβ associate with each other and with MSY1 via DNA-independent protein-protein interactions (13Kelm Jr., R.J.

First, all three proteins were efficiently captured from a fibroblast nuclear extract using a biotinylated synthetic CE-RNA oligonucleotide coupled to paramagnetic particles (Fig. 1). Second, multiple cDNAs encoding MSY1 were cloned from a mouse lung cDNA expression library using CE-RNA as a probe (Fig. 4). Third, purified recombinant Purα, Purβ, and MSY1 each independently bound a CE-RNA probe by Northwestern blotting (Fig. 5). Fourth, the wild-type CE sequence but not a mutant deficient in Purα, Purβ, and MSY1 binding, impaired translation of a CAT reporter mRNA when placed in the 5′-UTR of the CAT gene (Figs. 2 and 3). These new findings, together with our previous results, suggest that there are at least two potential regulatory binding sites for Purα, Purβ, and MSY1 in the mouse VSM α-actin gene. Although human and avian Purα (20Tretiakova A. Gallia G.L. Shcherbik N. Jameson B. Johnson E.M. Amini S. Khalili K. J. Biol.

Mouse Purβ is ∼70% identical to mouse Purα at the amino acid level (14Kelm Jr., R.J. Elder P.K. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26727-26733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Like Purα, Purβ is a modular protein characterized by a N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–39) rich in glycine residues, a central domain (amino acids 40–263) consisting of three basic-aromatic (class I) and two acidic-leucine rich (class II) repeats, a C-terminal domain (amino acids 264–324) containing a region of limited similarity to T-antigen (termed the psycho motif in Purα; Ref. 27Johnson E.M. Chen P.-L. Krachmarov C.P. Barr S.M. Kanovsky M. Ma Z.-W. Lee W.-H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 26727-26733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar; see Fig. 5). Comparative ssDNA and RNA binding analyses of C-terminal deletion mutants revealed that amino acids 264–324 were dispensable for ssDNA and RNA binding (Figs. 5 and 6), while ELISA data suggested that this region was critical for high affinity binding to Purα and MSY1 (Fig. 9). Additional deletion of amino acids 237–263, which includes the third basic-aromatic repeat, eliminated ssDNA, RNA, and protein-binding capacity, implying that there is some partial overlap in amino acid sequences that mediate nucleic acid binding and protein-protein interaction. In contrast to these results, the third basic-aromatic repeat does not seem to be required for Purα binding to either ssDNA (27Johnson E.M. Chen P.-L. Krachmarov C.P. Barr S.M. Kanovsky M. Ma Z.-W.

Chem. 1998; 273: 22241-22247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Curiously, further deletion of amino acids 187–236 restored the ability of mutant Purβ to bind RNA (Fig. 5) but failed to restore ssDNA binding (Fig. 6). Amino acids 187–236 encompass an acidic-leucine repeat that is interrupted by a glycine-rich stretch in Purβ but not in Purα (Ref. 14Kelm Jr., R.J. Elder P.K. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26727-26733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar; see Fig. 5). This structural difference could explain why this region appears to function as an inhibitory domain in Purβ-RNA binding. In Purα, sequences within this region appear to be required for binding to the purine-rich strand of c-myc PUR element (27Johnson E.M. Chen P.-L. Krachmarov C.P. Barr S.M. Kanovsky M. Ma Z.-W.

Thus, one cannot exclude the possibility that the relative importance of the second acidic-leucine repeat module to single-stranded nucleic acid binding by the Pur proteins may be dictated by the target sequence.What is the functional consequence of Purα, Purβ, and MSY1 binding to VSM α-actin CE-RNA? Incorporation of this sequence into the 5′-UTR of a CAT reporter gene substantially reduced the efficiency of CAT protein translation in a manner that was dependent on nucleotides that contribute to high affinity Pur protein/MSY1 mRNA-binding (Figs. 1,2, 3, and 7). Interestingly, this same CE sequence suppressed CAT mRNA transcription when positioned 5′ and directly flanking an enhancer-protein binding site in chimeric promoter-reporter gene constructs in a manner that was again dependent on Purα/Purβ (then termed VACssBF2) binding, but in this instance, to the CE-F DNA strand (16Kelm Jr., R.J. Sun S. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24278-24285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). While these results do not directly address the issue of the functional significance of Pur protein and/or MSY1 binding to the CE in its natural exonic position, they do, however, suggest that these proteins possess the capacity to influence gene expression at the level of transcription and translation. In this regard, it is noteworthy that Y-box protein homologues have been implicated in transcriptional activation (3Tafuri S.R. Wolffe A.P. New Biol. 1992; 4: 349-359PubMed Google Scholar, 30Zou Y.

Biol. 1999; 19: 2712-2723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Clearly, one of the most striking and unexpected findings to emerge from these studies is that MSY1 exhibits specific binding to a pyrimidine-rich ssDNA sequence and to a completely unrelated purine-rich mRNA sequence within the same gene. This mRNA sequence is also unrelated to a previously characterizedXenopus Y-box protein (FRGY2) consensus RNA binding motif identified through in vitro selection (19Bouvet P. Matsumoto K. Wolffe A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28297-28303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and implicated in translational repression (4Tafuri S.R. Wolffe A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24255-24261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although MSY1 has been proposed to similarly participate in translational masking and mRNA packaging (5Tafuri S.R. Familari M. Wolffe A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12213-12220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the distinctiveness of its VSM α-actin CE-RNA binding site suggests an alternative functional role. It is tempting to speculate that expression of the VSM α-actin gene in fibroblasts could be regulated through the coordinated interaction of Purα, Purβ, and MSY1 with promoter- and mRNA-derived sequences. For example, sequestration of Purα, Purβ, and MSY1 by virtue of binding to newly transcribed mRNA might establish an autoregulatory loop to augment VSM α-actin transcription. An analogous mechanism involving β-casein mRNA-dependent sequestration of a ssDNA-binding repressor has been proposed to explain the lactogenic hormone-induced expression of the β-casein gene in mammary epithelial cell (44Altiok S. Groner B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6004-6012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is also possible that Purα, Purβ, and MSY1 may function in regulating some other aspect of mRNA metabolism, such as pre-mRNA splicing. This is suggested by the similarity between the exon-derived CE sequence and a class of purine-rich sequences located within the exons of several different cellular and viral genes, which affect splice site selection and kinetics of pre-mRNA processing (45Xu R. Teng J. Cooper T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3660-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 46Watakabe A. Tanaka K. Shimura Y.

The position of the CE precisely at the intron 2/exon 3 boundary lends further credence to this notion. Clearly, the significance of Purα, Purβ, and MSY1 binding to VSM α-actin CE-RNA will only be resolved through further experimentation. In eukaryotes, protein synthesis is the end result of an integrated program of gene transcription, pre-mRNA processing, and mRNA transport, translation, and metabolism. The molecular mechanisms that function to integrate these diverse processes are largely unknown, but in some cases appear to involve multifunctional proteins capable of associating with regulatory sequences in both DNA and RNA. In Xenopus for example, FRGY2 was originally identified as an oocyte-specific transcription factor that associates with a DNA regulatory element termed the Y-box (1Wolffe A.P. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). However, recent studies have shown that FRGY2 also functions to repress mRNA translation, in part, by binding to a specific mRNA sequence motif (2Matsumoto K. Meric F. Wolffe A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22706-22712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Thus, expression of FRGY2 leads to both increased transcription from promoters containing a Y-box and translational silencing of the mRNA transcripts (3Tafuri S.R. Wolffe A.P. New Biol. 1992; 4: 349-359PubMed Google Scholar, 4Tafuri S.R. Wolffe A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24255-24261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, MSY1, the mouse homologue of FRGY2, has been proposed to have dual roles in activating germ cell-specific transcription in the testis and translational repression of the resulting mRNA (5Tafuri S.R. Familari M. Wolffe A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12213-12220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both situations are reminiscent of the dual role of transc"

Indispensabilities of Val39, Ile45, and Leu53 indicate that an amphipathic property of α-helix I consisting of 14 residues of the module (Thr44–Gly58) is essential to maintain the stable catalytic surface for 8-oxo-dGTPase. 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2′-deoxyguanosine 5′-triphosphate There are various causes for mutations of genomes of living organisms. The oxidation of nucleic acids by oxygen radicals, generated during normal cellular metabolism such as oxygen respiration, is considered to be one of major causes of spontaneous mutation (1Kasai H. Nishimura S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 2137-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar, 2Ames B.N. Gold L.S. Mutat. Res. 1991; 250: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 3Ames B.N. Shigenaga M.K. Hagen T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7915-7922Crossref PubMed Scopus (5418) Google Scholar). Oxygen radicals attack free nucleotides as well as DNA, and it has been established that 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-dGTP (8-oxo-dGTP),1 an oxidized form of dGTP, is highly mutagenic and a main endogenous source for spontaneous mutagenesis. During DNA replication, 8-oxo-dGTP can be inserted into the nascent strand opposite adenine and cytosine in the template with almost equal efficiency, an event that leads to an A:T to C:G transversion mutation (4Maki H. Sekiguchi M. Nature. 1992; 355: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar, 5Cheng K.C. Cahill D.S. Kasai H. Nishimura S. Loeb L.A. J. Biol.

MutT protein hydrolyzes 8-oxo-dGTP to the monophosphate form, thus eliminating mutagenic substrates from the DNA precursor pool (4Maki H. Sekiguchi M. Nature. 1992; 355: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). Lack of the mutT gene increases the spontaneous occurrence of A:T to C:G transversion 1000-fold over the wild type level (7Yanofsky C. Cox E.C. Horn V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1966; 55: 274-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 8Akiyama M. Maki H. Sekiguchi M. Horiuchi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Moreover, it has been shown that Escherichia coli RNA polymerase misinserts 8-oxo-GTP, an oxidized form of GTP, into mRNA, yielding mutant forms of proteins known as nongenomic mutations in mutT-deficient cells. MutT protein efficiently hydrolyzes 8-oxo-GTP and thus minimizes errors caused by misincorporation of oxidized guanine nucleotides into RNA (10Taddei F. Hayakawa H. Bouton M.F. Cirinesi A.M. Matic I. Sekiguchi M. Radman M. Science. 1997; 278: 128-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Enzymatic activity similar to that of MutT protein has been identified in human cells (11Mo J.Y. Maki H. Sekiguchi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11021-11025Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 12Sakumi K. Furuichi M. Tsuzuki T. Kakuma T. Kawabata S. Maki H. Sekiguchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23524-23530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on partial amino acid sequences obtained from a purified preparation of human 8-oxo-dGTPase, cDNA and the gene for the human enzyme were isolated and named MTH1(mutT homolog-1) (12Sakumi K.

Nakabeppu Y. Tsuzuki T. Sekiguchi M. Genomics. 1994; 24: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Because 30 amino acid residues (23%) are identical between MutT and MTH1 proteins, expression of the human enzyme in mutT − E. coli cells suppresses the elevated level of spontaneous mutation frequency to almost normal, indicating that the human enzyme has the same antimutagenic capacity as does the E. coli MutT protein.MTH1 mRNA is abundant in the human thymus, testis, and the embryonic tissues. In peripheral blood lymphocytes, expression of MTH1 mRNA is induced after proliferative activation, suggesting that MTH1 expression is up-regulated in proliferative tissues (14Oda H. Nakabeppu Y. Furuichi M. Sekiguchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17843-17850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). MTH1 protein is localized mostly in the cytoplasm with some in mitochondria (15Kang D. Nishida J. Iyama A. Nakabeppu Y. Furuichi M. Fujiwara T. Sekiguchi M. Takeshige K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14659-14665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), which means that MTH1 proteins are involved in sanitization of nucleotide pools, both for nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. Genes for MutT homolog proteins with dGTPase or 8-oxo-dGTPase activity were identified in Proteus vulgaris and Streptococcus pneumoniae, bacteria distantly related to E. coli (16Kamath A.V. Yanofsky C. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 134: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar,17Méjean V. Sallers C. Bullions L.C. Bessman M.J. Claverys J.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). All three MutT homolog proteins have molecular masses ranging from 13 to 18 kDa, and the degree of identity ranges from 19 to 40%. Most of the identical residues are in a region corresponding to the 23 residues from Gly37 to Gly59 of E. coli MutT, known as the MutT signature (18Bessman M.J. Frick D.N. Handley S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25059-25062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Homologs of human MTH1 protein were identified in mice and rats when isolating their cDNA (19Kakuma T. Nishida J. Tsuzuki T. Sekiguchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25942-25948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 20Cai J.P. Kakuma T. Tsuzuki T. Sekiguchi M. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 2343-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and as the degree of identity ranges from 85 to 90%, mammalian MTH1 proteins are highly diverged from bacterial counterparts. Structural analyses of the E. coli MutT protein revealed that a region containing the MutT signature constitutes the active center of dGTPase, with a loop and α-helix structure (21Lin J. Abeygunawardana C. Frick D.N. Bessman M.J. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6715-6726Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 22Lin J. Abeygunawardana C. Frick D.N. Bessman M.J. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1199-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The 23-residue sequence is a sole conserved sequence among all MutT and MTH1 homologs with 8-oxo-dGTPase, and of the many other proteins with the MutT signature so far identified, some hydrolyze various nucleotide derivatives, such as dATP, diadenosine oligophosphates, NADH, ADP-ribose, and GDP-mannose (23O'Handley S.F.

Thus enzymes with the MutT signature are designated as belonging to the Nudix hydrolase family, and the signature is known as Nudix box (18Bessman M.J. Frick D.N. Handley S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25059-25062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a diphosphoinositol polyphosphate phosphohydrolase that hydrolyzes the non-Nudix substrate, diphosphoinositol polyphosphate, also contains the 23-residue sequence (26Safrany S.T. Caffrey J.J. Yang X. Bembenek M.E. Moyer M.B. Burkhart W.A. Shears S.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6599-6607Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the 23-residue sequence may constitute a functional module essential for hydrolysis of a phosphodiester bond in such Nudix or diphosphoinositol derivatives; however, there has been no direct evidence indicating that the 23-residue sequence constitutes a functional module. We now provide the first evidence that the 23-residue sequences of human MTH1 and E. coli MutT proteins are exchangeable so that they constitute functionally equivalent modules for 8-oxo-dGTPase, designated as the phosphohydrolase module. We further carried out a saturation mutagenesis of the module of human MTH1 protein to reveal the role of each amino acid residue.

Plasmid pALTER-1 was purchased from Promega and used for saturation mutagenesis. Plasmid pTT100 is a derivative of pTrc99A lacking the lacI q gene. The wild type MTH1 cDNA encoding 18 kDa of Val83-MTH1d polypeptide was subcloned into NcoI-BamHI sites of pTT100 yielding pTT100:hMTH1 (13Furuichi M. Yoshida M.C. Oda H. Tajiri T. Nakabeppu Y.

Open table in a new tab To replace the 23-residue module between MTH1 and MutT proteins, two unique restriction sites were introduced into human MTH1 cDNA; BalI site at the 36th codon (Gly36) and SmaI site at the 58th codon (Gly58), and into E. coli mutT gene; SmaI site at the 37th codon (Gly37) and HincII site at the 59th codon (Gly59) of mutT gene, by polymerase chain reaction-mediated mutagenesis using mutagenesis primers shown in Table I (29Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2641) Google Scholar). The BalI-SmaI fragment of human MTH1 cDNA cloned into pTT100 was replaced with theSmaI-HincII fragment from mutT gene, yielding a plasmid (pTT100:MTH1-Ec) encoding the chimeric protein, designated MTH1-Ec. Saturation mutagenesis was performed for the plasmid pALTER:MTH-ss, using the mutagenesis primers listed in Table II, according to the Promega technical manual of altered sites IIin vitro mutagenesis system but with the modifications described (28Cai J.P. Kawate H. Ihara K. Yakushiji H. Nakabeppu Y. Tsuzuki T. Sekiguchi M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1170-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Mutagenized DNA were digested with a set of restriction enzymes SacI and NcoI and subcloned into pTT100:hMTH1. A mixture of plasmids pTT100:hMTH1(G36X), for example, carrying mutations at the codon for Gly36 thus obtained was applied to E. coli CC101T and cultured on agar medium containing minimal A salts, 0.2% glucose, 0.05% phenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside, and 40 μg/ml of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside. After incubation for 5 days at 37 °C, papillae formation was examined, and appropriate samples were subjected to further analyses. Bacteria were grown overnight in LB medium in the presence of 50 μg/ml of ampicillin, and aliquots containing about 100 cells were inoculated into 5 ml of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml of ampicillin at 37 °C for 48 h. Mutant frequencies were determined by plating aliquots of cultures on normal and 0.4% lactose-containing minimal A medium plates with 50 μg/ml of ampicillin. Three independent experiments were done, and mutation rates were calculated (30Luria S.E. Delbrück M. Genetics. 1943; 28: 491-511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Capizzi R.L. Jameson J.W. Mutat.

Sekiguchi M. Mutat. Res. 1997; 384: 181-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), were subjected to 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then to Western blotting. Purified 18-kDa Val83-MTH1d polypeptide (27Yakushiji H. Maraboeuf F. Takahashi M. Deng Z.S. Kawabata S. Nakabeppu Y. Sekiguchi M. Mutat. Res. 1997; 384: 181-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) was used as a standard for quantification of mutant MTH1 protein in the bacterial extracts. Western blotting was done as described (28Cai J.P. Kawate H. Ihara K. Yakushiji H. Nakabeppu Y. Tsuzuki T. Sekiguchi M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1170-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), using anti-MTH1 or anti-M77 antibodies. 8-oxo-dGTPase activity was measured as described (11Mo J.Y. Maki H. Sekiguchi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11021-11025Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 28Cai J.P. Kawate H. Ihara K. Yakushiji H. Nakabeppu Y. Tsuzuki T. Sekiguchi M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1170-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). One unit of 8-oxo-dGTPase was defined as the amount of enzyme that produced 1 pmol of 8-oxo-dGMP/min at 30 °C. Specific activity of mutant MTH1 protein was calculated based on the content of each mutant MTH1 protein in the extract, determined by Western blotting. To determine whether the 23-residue sequence of MTH1 is functionally equivalent to that of MutT, we constructed plasmid pTT100:MTH1-Ec, encoding a chimeric protein MTH1-Ec, in which the sequence of MTH1 (Gly36–Gly58) was replaced with that of MutT (Gly37–Gly59), as shown in Fig. 1. Plasmids, pTT100, pTT100:hMTH1, and pTT100:MTH1-Ec were introduced into E. coli strain CC101T (mutT − , lacZ −), which exhibits an elevated spontaneous mutation rate of A:T to C:G transversion, which can be detected by LacZ+ reversion (Table III). At 30 °C, expression of MTH1 reduced the elevated mutation rate (1.13 × 10−6) seen in CC101T, to 173 of the level, and expression of MTH1-Ec in CC101T also reduced the spontaneous mutation rate to 1.99 × 10−7, which reaches 113 of the level attained by expression of MTH1 itself. This result clearly indicates that the chimeric protein MTH1-Ec has a significant capacity to suppress the increased spontaneous mutation rate inmutT −-deficient cells, albeit the level being lower than that seen with the wild type MTH1. Furthermore, we found that the potential of MTH1-Ec to suppress the occurrence of spontaneous mutations in CC101T cells is thermolabile, because expression of MTH1-Ec at 37 °C only suppressed the elevated mutation rate (2.47 × 10−6) seen in CC101T to 13 of the level (Table III).Table IIIBiological and biochemical property of chimeric protein MTH1-EcTemperatureaE. coli cells harboring each plasmid were grown in LB broth at the temperature shown.PlasmidMutation rateMHT1 protein8-Oxo-dGTPase specific activity×10−9RatiobRelative ratio of each mutation rate to that of the wild type.ng/mg×102units/μgdSpecific activity of 8-oxo-dGTPase in each crude extract is shown as units/mg MTH1 protein, as determined by Western blotting.RatioeRelative ratio of the specific activity of MTH1-Ec to that of the wild type.30 °CpTT100 (vector)1130 ± 19073.4NDfND, not detected.NDpTT100:hMTH115.4 ± 4.91.0053248.81.00pTT100:MTH1-EcAmounts of MTH1 protein in crude extracts from cells carrying each plasmid were determined by quantitative Western blotting, and contents of MTH1 protein/mg of total E. coli protein are shown.199 ± 14512.990135.00.5437 °CpTT100 (vector)2470 ± 220274.4NDNDpTT100:hMTH19.00 ± 6.251.00170240.81.00pTT100:MTH1-EcAmounts of MTH1 protein in crude extracts from cells carrying each plasmid were determined by quantitative Western blotting, and contents of MTH1 protein/mg of total E. coli protein are shown.875 ± 63797.25262.50.26a E. coli cells harboring each plasmid were grown in LB broth at the temperature shown.b Relative ratio of each mutation rate to that of the wild type.c Amounts of MTH1 protein in crude extracts from cells carrying each plasmid were determined by quantitative Western blotting, and contents of MTH1 protein/mg of total E. coli protein are shown.d Specific activity of 8-oxo-dGTPase in each crude extract is shown as units/mg MTH1 protein, as determined by Western blotting.e Relative ratio of the specific activity of MTH1-Ec to that of the wild type.f ND, not detected. Open table in a new tab To obtain biochemical parameters that may explain the temperature-sensitive nature of MTH1-Ec, levels of expression and catalytic activity were compared with those for MTH1. As shown in Fig. 2 A, amounts of each protein were determined by Western blotting, using purified MTH1 protein as standards with anti-M77. At 37 °C, the cellular content of MTH1 protein was 170 ng/mg of total protein, whereas that of MTH1-Ec protein was 52 ng/mg. At 30 °C, though the content of wild type MTH1 decreased to 53 ng/mg, that of MTH1-Ec increased to 90 ng/mg (Table III), indicating that MTH1-Ec is more stable at a lower temperature. 8-oxo-dGTPase activity in crude extracts was measured as shown in Fig. 2 B, and the specific activity of MTH1 or MTH1-Ec was calculated based on their contents in crude extracts (Table III). Specific activity of MTH1 was determined to be 240.8 × 102 units/μg of MTH1 protein at 37 °C and 248.8 × 102 units/μg at 30 °C, respectively; values are close to that of purified MTH1 protein (300 × 102units/μg protein) (27Yakushiji H. Maraboeuf F. Takahashi M. Deng Z.S. Kawabata S. Nakabeppu Y. Sekiguchi M. Mutat. Res. 1997; 384: 181-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the specific activity of 8-oxo-dGTPase for MTH1-Ec protein was 62.5 × 102units/μg at 37 °C, that is about ¼ that for MTH1, indicating that total 8-oxo-dGTPase activity in cells expressing MTH1-Ec at 37 °C is less than 112 that in cells expressing MTH1 itself. At 30 °C, the specific activity increased 2-fold to 135.0 × 102 units/μg, comparable with the 54% level of MTH1 protein itself. Thus, we concluded that the chimeric protein MTH1-Ec retains 8-oxo-dGTPase activity comparable with that for MTH1 itself and thus has a significant capability to suppress the increased occurrence of A:T to C:G transversion in mutT-deficient cells, but it is thermolabile in terms of structure and function. Based on these findings, we propose that the 23-residue sequence constitutes an independent functional module for MTH1 and MutT family proteins. Residues in the 23-residue module of MTH1 are classified into three groups: conserved, semi-conserved, and nonconserved residues, as based on conservation among six MutT and MTH1 homologs, as shown in Fig. 3. We earlier reported that four conserved residues (Lys38, Glu43, Arg51, and Glu52) in human MTH1 protein cannot be replaced with any other amino acid residue without losing function, the approach used was negative and positive mutant screening, and we concluded that such are essential for MTH1 protein (28Cai J.P. Kawate H. Ihara K. Yakushiji H. Nakabeppu Y. Tsuzuki T. Sekiguchi M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1170-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For a complete understanding of roles of each amino acid residue in the 23-residue module, we carried out saturation mutagenesis of the other 19 residues in the module of human MTH1 protein, in combination with negative and positive mutant screening, using mutagenesis primers that contain a completely degenerated codon for each residue (Table II). First, we isolated negative mutants that lost the capability to suppress the elevated level of LacZ+ reversion in E. coli CC101T cells after introduction of the mutagenized plasmid pTT100:hMTH1 into the cells (TablesTable IV, Table V, Table VI). Next, we used one of the negative mutants for each residue as a template for the second round of saturation mutagenesis to isolate positive mutants that acquired the capability to suppress the LacZ+ reversion in CC101T cells. As shown in Table VII, mutation rates of CC101T cells harboring negative mutants used for the second mutagenesis as templates were as high as that of the cells with vector pTT100. Expression levels of the negative mutant proteins were lower than that of wild type MTH1, and their 8-oxo-dGTPase activity was detectable in only a few cases and was very low.Table VINegative and positive mutant screening for nonconserved residues of MTH1 proteinWild typeNegative mutantsPositive mutantsAmino acidCodonAmino acidCodonaNumber of mutants isolated for each codon is shown in parentheses.

Low density lipoprotein-receptor-related protein/α2-macroglobulin receptor (LRP/α2MR), a member of the low density lipoprotein receptor family, is responsible for the clearance of α2-macroglobulin-protease complexes. In this study, we examined whether C3 has conserved affinity for LRP/α2MR. Ligand blot experiments with human 125I-C3 on endosomal proteins show binding to a 600-kDa protein, indistinguishable from LRP/α2MR by the following criteria: it is competed by receptor-associated protein (the 39-kDa receptor-associated protein that impairs binding of all ligands to LRP/α2MR) and by lactoferrin and Pseudomonas exotoxin, other well known ligands of the multifunctional receptor. Binding of C3 is sensitive to reduction of the receptor and is Ca2+-dependent. All these features are typical for cysteine-rich binding repeats of the low density lipoprotein receptor family. In LRP/α2MR, they are found in four cassettes (2, 8, 10, and 11 repeats). Ligand blotting to chicken LR8 demonstrates that a single 8-fold repeat is sufficient for binding. Confocal microscopy visualizes initial surface labeling of human fibroblasts incubated with fluorescent labeled C3, which changes after 5 min to an intracellular vesicular staining pattern that is abolished in the presence of receptor-associated protein. Cell uptake is abolished in mouse fibroblasts deficient in LRP/α2MR. Native plasma C3 is not internalized. We demonstrate that the capacity to internalize C3 is saturable and exhibits a K D value of 17 nm. After intravenous injection, rat hepatocytes accumulate C3 in sedimentable vesicles with a density typical for endosomes. In conclusion, our ligand blot and uptake studies demonstrate the competence of the LRP/α2MR to bind and endocytose C3 and provide evidence for an LRP/α2MR-mediated system participating in C3 metabolism.

Nimpf J. Bujo H. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). A gene closely related to that of LRP/α2MR was identified in Caenorhabditis elegans, showing that LRP/α2MR is an evolutionarily old molecule (2Yochem J. Greenwald I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4572-4576Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). LRP/α2MR was discovered by its homology to structures of complement components (3Herz J. Hamann U. Rogne S. Myklebost O. Gausepohl H. Stanley K.K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4119-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar), and it was suggested that it might function together with the LDL receptor as receptor for apoE-containing lipoproteins executing the mass transport of chylomicron remnants (4Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar). Later, LRP/α2MR was shown to be identical with the α2MR (5Strickland D.K. Ashcom J.D. Williams S.

Sottrup Jensen L. FEBS Lett. 1990; 276: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In recent years, a plethora of new ligands were reported, and LRP/α2MR was classified as a multifunctional receptor (1Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. Bujo H. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 7Strickland D.-K. Kounnas M.-Z. Argraves W.-S. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 890-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Members of the LDL receptor family all consist of the same basic structural components: (i) a class of cysteine-rich repeats of approximately 40 amino acids, which are also present in the terminal complement components and are therefore referred to as complement type repeats (this sequence is believed to be responsible for binding of ligands); (ii) a second class of cysteine-rich repeats like those present in the epidermal growth factor precursor; (iii) an epidermal growth factor precursor homologous domain containing YWTD motifs, (iv) a single membrane-spanning segment; and (v) a cytoplasmic domain that contains one or more NPXY motifs, which are responsible for coated pit-mediated endocytosis (8Sudhof T.C. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Russell D.W. Science. 1985; 228: 815-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar,9Schneider W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 988: 303-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The ligand binding repeats are found in various members of the LDL receptor family assembled in clusters harboring 2–11 repeats, thereby varying affinity for different ligands. The study of the avian equivalents of members of the LDL receptor family profoundly refined the knowledge about the physiologic function of this receptor class as apoE is not expressed in avians. Similar to mass transport of chylomicron remnants into liver, LR8 on chicken oocyte membranes was found to mediate mass transport of egg yolk components into developing oocytes. (1Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. Bujo H. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 10Bujo H. Hermann M. Kaderli M.O. Jacobsen L. Sugawara S. Nimpf J. Yamamoto T. Schneider W.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5165-5175Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Human α2M is a macromolecular protease scavenger consisting of four subunits with an M r of 180,000 each. It is an acute phase protein inhibiting a wide range of proteases by forming a complex with them. Proteases cleave the molecule at the “bait region,” leading to the hydrolysis of the internal thioester followed by an extensive conformational transition of the α2M molecule. The conformational change results in the entrapment of the protease. Simultaneously, recognition sites are exposed enabling the α2M molecule to interact with its specific cell surface receptor, LRP/α2MR (11Moestrup S.K. Holtet T.L. Etzerodt M. Thogersen H.C. Nykjaer A. Andreasen P.A. Rasmussen H.H. Sottrup Jensen L. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13691-13696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting complex is then internalized by LRP/α2MR-mediated endocytosis. The transformation (“activation”) of the α2M molecule can also be induced by a direct nucleophilic attack in a process in which the thioester bond is hydrolyzed without initial alteration of the bait region. This form of α2M is also recognized by LRP/α2MR (5Strickland D.K. Ashcom J.D. Williams S. Burgess W.H. Migliorini M. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17401-17404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Kristensen T. Moestrup S.K. Gliemann J. Bendtsen L. Sand O. Sottrup Jensen L. FEBS Lett. 1990; 276: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Complement component 3 (C3) is a key molecule of the complement system. The classical and the alternative pathway lead to the formation of a convertase that cleaves C3 to C3a (molecular mass, 9 kDa) and C3b (178 kDa), resulting in the hydrolysis of the thioester bond. The subsequent dramatic conformational change in the molecule is a pivotal step in the complement activation (12Reid K.B.M. Nolan K.F. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 223: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The classical pathway is activated by antibody-antigen reactions. In the alternative pathway, the initial reaction and its conformational consequences are not as clearly defined as in the classical pathway. Initial complement deposition on surfaces is thought to arise from spontaneously activated C3 (C3*). The inherent instability of the internal thioester in the native C3 molecule spontaneously and continuously generates small amounts of fluid-phase and bound C3* (“tick over” activation). A number of proteins control activated C3* from triggering unnecessarily the amplification loop of the complement system. The spontaneous hydrolysis rate of the thioester bond in vitro, under physiologic conditions, is estimated to amount to approximately 1%/h. In adult humans, approximately 240 mg of C3* have to be removed continuously per day by a system with high capacity. Similar to in vivo tick over C3, activated C3* can be produced in vitro by treatment of native C3 with methylamine or with chaotropic agents or by slowly freezing and thawing of the protein and is referred to as C3(N)* (N stands for nucleophils, such as methylamine, ammonia, or water (13Gettins P.G.W. Crews B.C. FEBS Lett. 1993; 332: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar)). C3 and α2M belong to a group of evolutionarily related thioester-containing proteins (14Sottrup Jensen L. Stepanik T.M. Kristensen T. Lonblad P.B. Jones C.M. Wierzbicki D.M. Magnusson et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 15Lambris J.D. Mavroidis M. Pappas J. Lao Z. Wang Y. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 712: 354-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In the horseshoe crab, a single protein called Limulus α-macroglobulin complement-like protein possesses functional properties of both sides of the superfamily, namely, protease inhibition and participation in a hemolytic system (16Armstrong P.B. Armstrong M.T. Quigley J.P. Mol. Immunol. 1993; 30: 929-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Although with the evolutionary development, thioester proteins exhibited marked functional divergence, structural homologies persist. This led us to examine whether LRP/α2MR is capable of binding and mediating endocytosis of certain forms of C3*. We found that LRP/α2MR bound C3* in ligand blots. Very likely, the cysteine-rich complement type repeats were involved. Other ligands of LRP/α2MR, such as lactoferrin, receptor-associated protein (RAP), and Pseudomonas exotoxin, competed with C3*. Confocal microscopy demonstrated that fluorescent-labeled C3* but not native C3 was taken up into cells with features typical for receptor-mediated endocytosis. In the presence of RAP, which abolishes all binding to LRP/α2MR, uptake into cells was abolished. We found that in the intact rat, some endogenous C3* was present in liver endosomes. Uptake into liver and recovery in endosomes occurred very effectively when C3* was injected as a bolus, intravenously. From these data, we propose that LRP/α2MR plays an active role in the clearance of activated C3*. We obtained chemicals from Sigma and Na125I for protein iodination from NEN Life Science Products. Bovine lactoferrin was a generous gift from Morinaga Co.. Mouse fibroblasts deficient in LRP/α2MR expression were obtained from J. Herz (University of Texas Health Science Center, Dallas, TX) (17Willnow T.E. Herz J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 719-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). C3 was obtained from Chemicon (Temecula, CA) or prepared following an adapted protocol of Janatova (18Janatova J. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 162: 579-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, 250 ml of freshly donated blood was used in phosphate buffers with all conductivity tests done with a Lovibond-Checkit-Micro (0–1990 μS). Batch adsorption of C4 and C3 was performed on Q-Sepharose (Fast Flow, Sigma Q 1126). The fractions containing C3, eluted by a salt gradient (100–200 mmNaCl), were pooled and prepared for a hydrophobic interaction chromatography using phenyl-agarose (Sigma P-8901) to remove C5 and factor H. C3 purity and content in the fractions was determined by SDS-PAGE and by slot-blotting (Hoefer, Vienna, Austria) with immunodetection with a rabbit anti-human C3c-antibody (DAKO) and visualized with peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody and ECL-detection (Pierce). Purified material migrated as a double band of approximately 180 kDa. The rabbit anti-human C3-antibody (DAKO) recognized both bands (estimated purity, >95%). No signal was detected with an anti-C4 antibody (DAKO). The internal thioester in the α-chain was analyzed by using the DIC assay (18Janatova J. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 162: 579-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). C3 that reacted with nucleophils and incorporated these and is therefore in the process of the conformational rearrangement is designated C3(N)* according to Pangburn (19Pangburn M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8584-8590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the conformational change is completed, the asterisk is dropped. This conformation, now designated C3(N), has also been referred to as C3* or C3b-like C3, because it is similar to the proteolytically generated C3b. For analysis, the samples were boiled in the presence of 3% SDS without reducing reagents at 95 °C for 15 min and then reduced in electrophoresis sample buffer with 0.1 m dithiothreitol at 95 °C for 5 min. After separation on SDS-polyacrylamide, gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Alternatively, they were blotted on nitrocellulose sheets and detected with the antibody against C3. Reduced native C3 without DIC treatment gave two bands with electrophoretic mobility values of 115 (uncleaved α-chain) and 75 kDa (β-chain), whereas after DIC treatment, it showed an additional band at 40 kDa resulting from the cleavage of the reactive α-chain. We used C3 preparations in which the 40-kDa band was absent or minor; upon three cycles of freezing in liquid nitrogen and thawing, these preparations developed as described (19Pangburn M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8584-8590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To study the difference in cell uptake between native and activated C3, we used fresh human serum and serum that was freeze/thaw cycled three times to activate C3. For the LRP/α2MR antibody, polyclonal rabbit anti-LRP/α2MR antiserum was obtained from rabbits immunized with LRP/α2MR from rat liver endosomal fractions purified with a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-RAP affinity column. Recombinant GST and rat 39-kDa fusion protein (designated GST-RAP) were produced following the procedure of Herz et al. (20Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Strickland D.K. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21232-21238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subcellular fractions (oocyte membranes from chicken, plasma membranes, and endosomes from rat liver) were prepared essentially as described (10Bujo H. Hermann M. Kaderli M.O. Jacobsen L. Sugawara S.

Chem. 1992; 267: 18551-18557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the labeling of C3, C3* was radiolabeled with Na125I, using Iodo-Beads (Pierce), to a specific activity of 1000 cpm/ng and was dialyzed extensively against TBS-EDTA (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.15m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA) before use. For cell uptake studies, C3* was fluorescent-labeled with BODIPY-succinimidylester (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands). A solution of 335 μg of BODIPY in 10 μl of Me2SO was coupled in 20-fold molar excess with C3* (1 mg/ml in 0.1 msodium bicarbonate) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Uncoupled dye was removed by passing the solution over a PD-10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Controls with preparation of C3 were performed on 4–15% Phastgels with SDS-buffer strips according to the manufacturer's protocols (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Separation of endosomal fractions and LR8 preparations was done using 4–12% SDS gradient gels in a Bio-Rad apparatus followed by transfer to nitrocellulose according to the manufacturer's protocols. Immunodetection was done essentially as described (23Meilinger M. Haumer M. Szakmary K.A. Steinbock F. Scheiber B. Goldenberg H. Huettinger M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) using HRP-conjugated second antibodies (Bio-Rad) and the ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the specifications of the manufacturer. ECL signal was quantitated by a Bio-Rad Fluor-S MultiImager. For quantification of bound radioactive ligands, counting was performed in a Packard Instant Imager (Packard Canberra, Vienna, Austria). Fibroblasts were maintained in monolayer and used for experiments as described previously (22Huettinger M. Retzek H. Hermann M. Goldenberg H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18551-18557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Huettinger M. Retzek H. Eder M. Goldenberg H. Clin. Biochem. 1988; 21: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Cells grown on coverslips (Nunc) were incubated with BODIPY-labeled C3* (2 μg/ml) for the indicated times and observed in a Zeiss Axiovert 135 microscope with fluorescence equipment. Experiments were duplicated with unlabeled C3*, and localization was detected with anti-C3 antibody (DAKO) and visualized with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled second antibody. Where indicated, cell nuclei were stained with bisbenzimid dye (Hoechst 33258). Intracellular localization was determined using a Carl Zeiss laser scanning microscope with HeNe laser excitation, and sections of 1 μm were made sequentially in the z plane. For cell binding and uptake studies, C3 was biotinylated with EZ-LinkTM Biotin Hydrazide (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Unreacted material was removed by dialysis. Mouse fibroblasts devoid of LRP expression, and wild type mouse fibroblasts expressing LRP (17Willnow T.E. Herz J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 719-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were seeded into 24-well plates and grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 24 h. To start binding and uptake, the culture medium was replaced by medium containing biotinylated C3*. After 3 h, equilibrium of uptake and elimination was reached, determined by receptor activity. Cells were washed three times and lysed, the content of C3 detected on slot blots using HRP-conjugated anti-biotin antibody (Vector) with ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and quantitated by a Bio-Rad Fluor-S MultiImager. Unspecific binding measured in LRP defective cells was subtracted to calculate binding parameters. All results are one representative of experiments performed at least twice. We reasoned from the inherent genetic relationship of C3 and α2M that LRP/α2MR may bind C3. Thus, we performed ligand blotting experiments using liver subcellular fractions to screen for proteins binding C3* with high affinity. For ligand overlays, we used C3 treated to favor production of thioester cleaved forms (C3*) as tested by DIC-C3 electrophoresis (see under “Experimental Procedures”). With gradient PAGE, we separated plasma membrane and endosomal proteins from rat liver and ligand blotted with 125I-C3*. In Fig. 1, we show that in plasma membrane, the dominant binding protein was an approximately 80-kDa protein. However, C3* binding was insensitive to addition of RAP, indicating that this protein was not a member of the LDL receptor family. In addition, a faint band at 600 kDa was visible. In endosomes, the 600-kDa protein was the prominent binding protein visualized with C3*, and binding to it was abolished when RAP was present in the incubation mixture. The electrophoretic migration and immunological response of this band was indistinguishable from that of LRP/α2MR (not shown). The RAP-insensitive binding protein at 80 kDa was barely visible. Having established that at least one of the binding proteins for C3* in liver might be LRP/α2MR, we tested whether this function is specific for LRP/α2MR or extends to other members of the LDL receptor family. We used chicken oocyte membrane extracts, which are a rich source of LR8, the chicken homologue of mammalian very low density lipoprotein receptor. We have previously shown that this receptor was able to bind some typical ligands of LRP/α2MR (25Nimpf J. Schneider W.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 737: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Using chicken oocyte membrane extracts, LR8 (95 kDa) was detected as the sole binding protein for C3*. When RAP was added, binding disappeared in the same way as when EDTA was added. Specific features of the binding were tested by varying cofactors, inhibitors, and competitors specific for LRP/α2MR (Fig. 2). Equal amounts of endosomal protein were examined by ligand blotting, and the amount of C3 that bound to LRP/α2MR was quantitated by densitometric scanning of the ECL signal. When Ca2+ was removed by addition of EDTA (10 mm) to the incubation buffer, binding was abolished. Again, complete inhibition of binding was achieved when RAP was added to the incubation mixture. Treatment of the endosomal proteins bound to the nitrocellulose with dithiothreitol before incubation with C3 reduced the binding signal to 10% of normal. This feature was extensively described to be due to the reduction of cysteine disulfide bridges that are crucial for maintaining the tertiary structure of the ligand binding domains of members of the LDL receptor family. In addition,Pseudomonas exotoxin, which is one of the ligands described for LRP (26Kounnas M.Z. Morris R.E. Thompson M.R. FitzGerald D.J. Strickland D.K. Saelinger C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12420-12423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), reduces the binding to 20% of normal. Lactoferrin, which is another example of an immediate immune response molecule that was also shown to be a ligand of LRP/α2MR (22Huettinger M. Retzek H. Hermann M. Goldenberg H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18551-18557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Meilinger M. Haumer M. Szakmary K.A. Steinbock F. Scheiber B. Goldenberg H. Huettinger M.

We next determined C3* internalization mediated by LRP/α2MR on the cellular level. Human fibroblasts, which express internalization-competent LRP/α2MR, were grown in chamber slides. We incubated the cells with fluorescent-labeled C3* either 60 min at 4 °C to demonstrate plasma membrane binding, or 30 min at 37 °C for uptake into cells. In the plasma membrane labeling experiment, an even surface distribution of the labeled ligand was seen (Fig. 3 B). Exposing cells for 30 min caused a distinct vesicular pattern to be exhibited (Fig. 3 C). In confocal planar section series (Fig. 3 A), the late stages of endocytosis were clearly located in the midsections of the cell, with the perinuclear compartments positive for C3* fluorescence. In the presence of RAP (Fig. 3 D), intracellular perinuclear distribution of fluorescent labeled C3* was completely abolished. To further demonstrate the competence of LRP/α2MR we studied the uptake of C3* in the mouse fibroblasts deficient in LRP/α2MR. In contrast to wild type cells (Fig. 3, LRP+), the mutant fibroblasts do not internalize C3. This experiment proved on a genetic level that LRP/α2MR mediates uptake of C3*. Using the mouse fibroblasts, we determined the kinetic parameters of uptake of C3* by LRP/α2MR. Cells were incubated with biotin-labeled C3* at 37 °C for 3 h, and the cell-associated C3 transferred to nitrocellulose. It was quantitated with an anti-biotin antibody that was labeled with HRP. A linear signal in the concentration range between 0.5 and 5 ng was accomplished with ECL signal detection in the Bio-Rad Fluor-S MultiImager. Unspecific binding was determined accordingly but using LRP-deficient fibroblasts and subtracted from the total binding measured in LRP+ fibroblasts. In Fig. 4, it can be seen that specific uptake of C3* into LRP+ fibroblasts is saturable. At saturation, approximately 4 ng of C3 per 105 cells were taken up within a 3-h incubation period (40,000 molecules/cell/h). In Fig. 4,inset, we show Scatchard analysis of these data, giving aK D of 17 nm (mean, 15 ± 3). Our initial hypothesis was that a conserved structural similarity between α2M and C3 determines the ability of C3* to be recognized by the LRP/α2MR. To validate this suggestion, we added a 10-fold molar excess of methylamine-activated α2M to some of the incubation mixtures and measured C3* uptake. This addition resulted in an inhibition of uptake of C3* of 75%. The same reduction was found with the addition of a 50-fold molar excess of GST-RAP (not shown). In plasma, C3 is an abundant protein occurring with a concentration of roughly 1–2 mg/ml. In the experiment described above, we determined that saturation of LRP/α2MR-mediated uptake occurs above 50 nm. We thus incubated LRP+ fibroblasts with fresh serum diluted to this concentration of C3 for 45 min at 37 °C and determined intracellular C3 by immunofluorescence techniques as described. In Fig. 5, it can be seen that incubation with native C3 does not result in detectable uptake. We then activated the serum by three cycles of freezing in liquid nitrogen and thawing at 40 °C. In DIC assays, this treatment notably inhibited the appearance of the 40-kDa fragment. Uptake experiments with this activated form of C3* resulted in considerable intracellular localization. The addition of RAP again prohibited this uptake, strongly indicating that C3 has to be activated to allow uptake into cells mediated by LRP/α2MR. These experiments were done to determine whether uptake of C3* in vivofollowed the kinetics of liver uptake seen with other ligands of LRP/α2MR. Furthermore, we wanted to find out what molecular weight form of C3 accumulates in endosomes. In in vivo turnover experiments with 125I-C3*, we found a considerable fraction of C3* to be removed from the plasma and taken up within 20 min into the liver (not shown). In Fig. 6, we show the results of liver uptake experiments with a bolus injection of 250 μg of unlabeled C3* and a saline-injected rat (untreated). The intracellular distribution of C3* recovered in liver subcellular fractions (40,000 × g, vesicles) was analyzed by zonal rotor density gradient centrifugation. In Fig. 6, top panel, the density gradient profile is given in g/ml. Immunodetection of C3 in the density gradient fractions after injection of saline (untreated) and a mass bolus of unlabeled C3* are shown in the bottom two panels. Clearly, two different localization patterns of C3* were seen in immunoblot analysis of the density gradient fractions with anti-C3 polyclonal antibody detecting rat and human C3. In animals injected with saline, we detected immunoreactive material at the top of the gradient (density, 1.05 g/ml), corresponding to endogenous rat C3. This material was not particle-bound, indicating that it was likely native C3 of extracellular origin. Some C3-positive material was located in endosomes, which is in accordance with the hypothesis that endogenous tick over reaction in the rat produces a form of C3* that is taken up by endocytosis. In rats injected with C3*, immunopositive material accumulated markedly in the 1.12 g/ml density range. These subcellular fractions have been previously characterized to contain predominantly endosomes (21Goldenberg H. Seelos C. Chatwani S. Chegini S. Pumm R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1067: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that these fractions exhibit the highest concentration of LRP/α2MR, whereas RAP is located preferentially in fractions with higher density (23Meilinger M. Haumer M. Szakmary K.A. Steinbock F. Scheiber B. Goldenberg H. Huettinger M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). C3 in endosomal fractions was sedimentable by centrifugation, verifying that it was enclosed in vesicles (not shown). The molecular weight of the immunopositive material was indistinguishable from the injected material, indicating that a processing prior to uptake did not significantly alter migration in gel electrophoresis. C3 and α2M evolved from a common ancestor in which two specific functions, protease trapping and cell lysis, were combined, as described in the arthropod Limulus polyphemus(16Armstrong P.B. Armstrong M.T. Quigley J.P. Mol. Immunol. 1993; 30: 929-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The thioester bonds in complement component C3 and the protease inhibitor α2M have traditionally been thought of as fulfilling the dual roles of mediating covalent attachment and maintaining a thermodynamically unfavorable conformational state of the native (nonactivated) protein. The thus stabilized conformation keeps binding sites buried, to be uncovered for further reaction only after activation. The removal of the activated ancestral molecule that was not consumed by the complement cascade reactions was presumably performed by an evolutionarily old receptor. We speculated that LRP/α2MR, which is expressed in mammals, as well asC. elegans, might have preserved affinity not only for α2M but for C3* as well. Whether this feature is archaic or was preserved because of physiologic benefits will be an interesting task to determine. Our experiments clearly demonstrate that C3* specifically binds to LRP/α2MR immobilized on nitrocellulose and is internalized by LRP/α2MR in cell culture. In serum, C3 is present in concentrations over 1 g/liter, whereas in ligand binding experiments, concentrations as low as 2 μg/ml gave a positive signal. However, we never observed binding of C3* using total fresh serum in the ligand blot experiments. Thus, we believe that although transition of C3 from the native to the activated form continuously takes place, these forms are rapidly removed and consequently in a very low steady state concentration in serum. The data are therefore consistent with the hypothesis that a C3b-like form (C3*), which was activated in an activation process similar to the tick over process, is recognized by LRP/α2MR and is rapidly removed from the circulation, much like activated α2M. Our experiments also demonstrate that type A-like cysteine-rich repeats, which constitute the ligand-binding domain of the LDL receptor family, are responsible for the high affinity of LRP/α2MR to C3*. These ligand binding repeats are found in various members of the LDL receptor family assembled in 2–11-fold clusters, thereby varying binding parameters for different ligands. Interestingly, we could demonstrate that the described function does not require more than one cluster because LR8, a chicken homologue of the very low density lipoprotein receptor bearing eight repeats, was also able to bind C3*. ApoE, a ligand of LRP/α2MR in mammals, is not expressed in birds. C3, in contrast, is present and functional in these animal species as well (29Mavroidis M. Sunyer J.O. Lambris J.D. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 2164-2174PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, our findings might help to refine our view about evolutionary aspects about structure/function relationship of members of this receptor family. Although a vast number of data exist, not all details of conformational changes in the activation of native C3 are known. To this end, it is reasonable to assume an activation process, taking place in vitro and similar in vivo, that produces a form of C3* that can be recognized by LRP/α2MR. We interpret the data from our in vivo uptake studies to mean that in the intact rat, such minor but continuously generated C3* in plasma is internalized into endosomes continuously. We therefore obtained a weak immunopositive signal in the endosomal fraction in the control experiments. With injection of a bolus of 250 μg of C3*, the endogenous activated C3* was outnumbered, and uptake into liver endosomes occurred rapidly. The amount of C3* that accumulated in endosomes of rats injected with a bolus of C3* was at least 1 order of magnitude higher, and the molecule migrated to the same molecular weight position as the injected material. This indicates that no proteolytic processing of the injected C3* occurred prior to the uptake into liver and makes participation within the complement cascade unlikely. Although we do not have direct evidence from whole animal studies that RAP abolishes uptake of C3 into liver, this uptake is very likely dependent on LRP/α2MR, as we observed the same effect of RAP in fibroblasts and hepatocytes. In view of a recently proposed function of LRP/α2MR (1Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. Bujo H. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), it might serve as a carrier over barriers, transporting C3 to compartments that are otherwise not accessible for plasma proteins. Finally, an interesting, newly discovered function of C3 could involve LRP/α2 MR in C3 metabolism. It was recently reported that chylomicrons stimulate C3 synthesis in adipocytes by a factor of 100. In this situation, C3 is cleaved to C3a- and C3b-like portions. The first is used in the processing of the acylation stimulation protein governing fatty acid removal from the plasma; the latter has no known function and is likely to be removed (30Maslowska M. Scantlebury T. Germinario R. Cianflone K.R.A. J. Lipid Res.. 1997; 38: 1-11Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Sniderman A.D. Cianflone K. Arner P. Summers L.K. Frayn K.N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Indeed LRP/α2 MR is present on adipocytes, and it is tempting to infer its participation in this metabolic reaction. We are thankful to Karin Pankratz for great help with immunofluorescence microscopy."

It has been proposed that the lectin module alone has a necessary role in the intracellular translocation and secretion of proteins expressed containing G3.

Fosang A.J. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 861-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). The protein core consists of three globular and two extended domains. There is an N-terminal G1 domain that interacts specifically with hyaluronan to form multimolecular aggregates in which up to 100 aggrecan molecules bind to each hyaluronan chain (2Hardingham T.E. Muir H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 279: 401-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). In contrast, the C-terminal G3 domain has no clearly established function. It consists of a C-type lectin module, a complement regulatory protein-like module and two alternatively spliced EGF1-like modules. Its structure is highly conserved among aggrecans in different species, and closely related structures are present in other members of this family of proteoglycans, versican, neurocan, and brevican (3Ruoslahti E. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 489-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Its possible functions include both carbohydrate (4Halberg D.F. Proulx G. Doege K. Yamada Y. Drickamer K. J. Biol.

The cause of nanomelia in the chicken was identified as a mutation in the aggrecan gene that produced a premature stop codon in the extended CS-2 chondroitin sulfate attachment region (10Li H. Schwartz N.B. Vertel B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23504-23511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This resulted in the synthesis of aggrecan lacking the normal C-terminal G3 structure, and although the protein was translated and present intracellularly in chondrocytes, it was not fully glycosylated or secreted (11Vertel B.M. Walters L.M. Grier B. Maine N. Goetinck P.F. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 939-948Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Vertel B.M. Grier B.L. Li H. Schwartz N.B. Biochem.

Cartilage is an essential forerunner of skeletal development in the embryo, and in the nanomelic chick the lack of aggrecan stunted cartilage development and long bone formation. These observations led to the proposal that the G3 domain was necessary intracellularly for the translocation and secretion of aggrecan. Expression of chicken aggrecan G3 in Chinese hamster ovary cells showed that the G3 domain was much more efficient than the G1 domain in facilitating the secretion of an extended CS attachment sequence, and this was independent of its position 5′ or 3′ to the extended sequence (13Luo W. Kuwada T.S. Chandrasekaran L. Zheng J. Tanzer M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16447-16450Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Further refinement showed that the removal of the CRP module gave no loss of this activity, and finally, it was also shown that of the remaining LEC coding sequence, only the second of the three exons was necessary in the structure to ensure secretion of the product (9Zheng J. Luo W. Tanzer M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12999-13006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). From these results it was concluded that the LEC module was essential for aggrecan biosynthesis, to facilitate its intracellular translocation, and secretion. To follow up these results, in this study the secretory behavior of a larger range of constructs based on the human aggrecan G3 domain have been investigated after their transfection into mammalian cells of monkey or hamster origin. Total RNA was extracted with Tri-Reagent (Sigma) from a sample of human articular cartilage (kindly provided by Glynne Andrew, Hope Hospital, Salford, UK). Random-primed reverse transcriptase (RT) product was amplified with primers Agg 4 and Agg 11 (see Fig. 1 for primer details) in a PCR. The human EGF1 sequence was found in a 495-bp product. EGF2 cDNA was amplified using an overlapping primer PCR method (14Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2648) Google Scholar) with primers based on the human EGF2 sequence (15Fülöp C. Walcz E. Valyon M. Glant T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17377-17383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Primers Agg 4 and Agg 13 (inverse complement of bases 47 to 64 of the EGF2 sequence) were used to amplify the 5′ half of the EGF2 cDNA and 177 bp of the flanking upstream CS-2 chondroitin sulfate attachment region. Primers Agg 12 (bases 47 to 64 of the EGF2 sequence) and Agg 11 were used to amplify the 3′ half of the EGF2 motif cDNA and 204 bp of the downstream lectin-like motif. The final PCR product, amplified with primers Agg 4 and Agg 11, was a cDNA containing the EGF2 motif as though it had been alternatively spliced into the aggrecan mRNA. A cDNA containing both EGF motifs was prepared using a primer containing 20 bp at the 3′ end of the EGF1 motif and 20 bp at the 5′ end of the EGF2 motif and another primer containing the inverse complementary sequence. Human aggrecan signal sequence cDNA was amplified from the same total RNA pool by RT-PCR using primers Agg 18 (situated in the 5′-untranslated region of the published human aggrecan cDNA (16Doege K. Sasaki M. Kimura T. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 894-902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), bases 13 to 30 with an additional 5′ HindIII restriction enzyme site) and Agg 19 (inverse complement of bases 106 to 123 of the same sequence, with Glu-21 providing the GAA of an additional EcoRI restriction enzyme site). To construct a panel of cDNAs containing varying combinations of the folded motifs present in the G3 domain, a human aggrecan cDNA encoding the C-terminal 385 amino acids of the CS-2 region, the LEC, CRP and tail motifs (17Dudhia J. Davidson C. Wells T. Vynios D. Hardingham T. Bayliss M. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 933-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) was inserted into the EcoRI site of pBluescript KS (Stratagene) from which the XbaI and HincII sites had been deleted (Fig. 1 A). EGF sequences were inserted by digesting the RT-PCR products described above with XbaI andHincII and ligating these into the corresponding restriction sites in the original aggrecan cDNA. Constructs in which the LEC and CRP motifs were deleted either singly or together were made using an overlapping primer PCR method (14Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2648) Google Scholar) using plasmids as template. Each construct required two specific primers, one containing the last 20 bp of the first motif and the first 20 bp of the second motif to be joined together. The other specific primer was the inverse complementary sequence of the first. The sequence of the primers at the transition between motifs followed the predicted exon boundaries (18Valhmu W. Palmer G.D. Rivers P.A. Ebara S. Cheng J-F. Fischer S. Ratcliffe A. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) as though the motifs had been alternatively spliced. The other primers used for the PCR were Agg 4, Agg 1, and the T3 primer from the Bluescript vector (Fig. 1 A). PCR products and parent plasmids were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes and ligated together to produce the panel of constructs shown in Fig. 1. Constructs were released from the Bluescript vector by digestion with EcoRI and subcloned into the expression vectors pcS or pcA. Vector pcS was derived from the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) by replacing the cytomegalovirus promoter region with anNruI and BamHI fragment of the Sig pIg vector (R & D Systems) containing the cytomegalovirus promoter and the sequence encoding the CD33 signal peptide. To make vector pcA, human aggrecan signal sequence RT-PCR product (as described above), digested withHindIII and EcoRI, was subcloned into pcDNA3 digested with the same enzymes, placing the aggrecan AUG translation initiation codon under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter of the vector. Insert CS (Fig. 1 B) was made by digesting pcS.CS.L.C.t with XbaI, which removed the last 43 amino acids of the CS-2 region, the entire G3 region, and cuts in the multiple cloning site of the pcS vector at the 3′ end of the insert. Re-ligation of these XbaI sites fused 23 amino acids encoded by the pcS multiple cloning site onto the truncated CS-2 region. This was the only construct with any non-native sequence. All constructs were sequenced to verify in-frame addition of signal sequences and correct sequences across newly constructed motif junctions. In addition, all constructs were translated in a cell-free transcription/translation system (TNT-coupled transcription/translation system; Promega) to confirm full-length translation products. COS-1 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, penicillin (100 IU/ml), and streptomycin (100 (g/ml) in a humidified atmosphere (5% CO2) at 37 °C. Cells were transfected at ∼60% confluency with plasmid DNA (5 μg/60-mm culture dish) using DEAE-dextran (Promega) in chloroquine-containing medium for 4 h. Fresh medium was applied, and the following day the cells were incubated in medium (as above) containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum for a further 48 h. Embryonic Syrian hamster cells (DES4+.2) transformed with diethylstilbestrol (19McLachlan J.A. Wong A. Degen G.H. Barrett J.C. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 3040-3045PubMed Google Scholar, 20Cizdziel P.E.

Carcinog. 1991; 4: 14-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) were grown in minimum essential medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, penicillin (100 IU/ml), streptomycin (100 (g/ml), and minimum essential medium nonessential amino acids (1×) (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were transfected at ∼70% confluency with plasmid DNA (5 μg/60-mm culture dish) in Pfx-5 lipid solution (Invitrogen) in serum-free medium for 4 h. The transfection medium was replaced with complete culture medium for 18–24 h and then replaced with medium (as above) containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum for 48 h incubation. The harvested medium was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 2 min, and protease inhibitors were added (1 mm EDTA, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 5 μg/ml benzamidine HCl, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml chymostatin, and 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin). It was dialyzed against deionized water at 4 °C, freeze-dried, dissolved in chondroitinase ABC digestion buffer (0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15m NaCl) and stored at −20 °C. Total RNA was extracted from COS-1 and DES4+.2 cell layers in Tri-Reagent (Sigma), and cellular proteins were isolated from the organic phase of the extract using the manufacturer's alternative procedure. The volumes of cell protein extracts were adjusted to those of the medium samples by centrifugal evaporation, and 10× chondroitinase digestion buffer was added to ensure that comparisons were made between equal fractions of the total medium and the total cell layer extract. Chondroitin ABC lyase (Sigma) digestion of medium and cell layer extract samples was with 1.5 units/ml at 37 °C for 3 h, and in a similar buffer, digestion of N-linked oligosaccharides was with 0.23 units/ml endoglycosidase F, 0.29 units/ml peptide N-glycosidase F (Oxford Glycosciences, Abingdon, UK) incubated at 37 °C for 18 h. Samples from medium and cell extracts were electrophoresed under reducing conditions in 7.5% SDS-PAGE gels (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), in 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-Rad), or in NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris gels (NOVEX), transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (22Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar) (with Tris-Bicine transfer buffer (NOVEX) for Nu-PAGE gels), and blocked in 10 mm phosphate-buffered saline (138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.4) containing 4% nonfat dried milk powder. Transfer was confirmed by Ponceau R staining. Immunodetection of expressed products was carried out with JD5, a rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against a bacterial GST.CS2.LEC.CRP.t fusion protein (17Dudhia J. Davidson C. Wells T. Vynios D. Hardingham T. Bayliss M. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 933-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and also with mouse monoclonal antibodies, 1B5, 2B6, and 3B3, which recognize nonsulfated, 4-sulfated, and 6-sulfated chondroitin sulfate chains, respectively, after chondroitinase ABC digestion (23Couchman J.R. Caterson B. Christner J.E. Baker J.R. Nature. 1994; 307: 650-652Crossref Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Bound antibody was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies and chemiluminescence (NEN Life Science Products). Immunoblots were quantitated using a GS-700 imaging densitometer and Molecular Analyst software (Bio-Rad). The integrated optical density was determined for each band and corrected for background. For each construct the percentage of product secreted was calculated for three separate transfections from blots with nonsaturating densities and in a range that showed a linear correlation with loading. Constructs based on a cDNA coding for the C-terminal third of the human aggrecan mRNA were prepared in a vector, pcS, based on pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). This cDNA sequence included a major part (1155 bp) of the CS-2 chondroitin sulfate attachment region (CS) with 27 potential CS attachment sites, the C-lectin-like module (L), the complement regulatory protein-like module (C), and the natural short (74 bp) C-terminal sequence (t). This CS.L.C.t sequence (Fig. 1) is the form found most commonly in chondrocyte aggrecan mRNA and lacks the two alternatively spliced EGF-like modules (16Doege K. Sasaki M. Kimura T. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 894-902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The vector contained a signal sequence from the protein CD-33 to direct protein translation to membrane-bound ribosomes and into the secretory pathway. Other cDNA constructs were prepared with deletions of each of the LEC and CRP modules and with inserted EGF-1 (E1) and EGF-2 (E2) modules generated by RT-PCR from human chondrocyte mRNA. This provided a range of constructs containing the CS-2 region and a variable number of folded protein modules (Fig. 1). All the constructs were prepared with the folded protein modules delineated with junctions at the natural exon boundaries. The constructs were assessed initially by in vitrotranslation, and all gave protein products; however, many appeared to be larger than expected on SDS-PAGE. As only a construct lacking the CS-2 region was of the expected size (not shown), it appeared that anomalous migration was a property of the CS-2 region. This may result from poor binding of SDS by this protein region or possibly because it has an extended or stiffened conformation. It increased the apparent mass of all products containing the CS-2 region by about 40 kDa in the electrophoresis system used, but it was also observed with CS-2 products from in vitro translation. The anomalous migration was therefore not a result of the glycosylation of CS-2. Initial transfection studies were carried out in COS-1 cells (monkey origin). Transfection of the basic CS.L.C.t construct with DEAE-dextran produced transient expression, which was investigated by immunoblotting of cell layer and medium samples after SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). The results showed that the protein was synthesized and secreted and was well detected by the antiserum in the cell layer and in the medium after culture for 48 h. The separate removal of either of the LEC or CRP modules had no significant effect on synthesis and secretion in transfected cells. However, constructs containing the CS-2 region but lacking both LEC and CRP modules (CS.t and CS) were much less abundant in the medium at 48 h, although they were well expressed in the cell layer. The relatively long culture time used for these analyses showed a clear distinction between protein products that were secreted into the medium (80–90% in the medium in 48 h) and products that appeared intracellularly but were not efficiently secreted into the medium (<10% in the medium in 48 h). This established a pattern of synthesis and secretion in which the presence of either the LEC or the CRP module was necessary for the efficient secretion of a CS-2 region (Table I).Table ISecretion of aggrecan constructs by COS-1 cellscDNA constructSecretion% totalCS.L C.t95.8 ± 1.4CS.C.t89.1 ± 8.2CS.L.t89.4 ± 7.1CS.t7.8 ± 7.4CS1.4 ± 1.3 Open table in a new tab Having obtained this result in COS-1 cells, the pattern of secretion was also investigated in DES4+.2 cells. These cells are derived from Syrian hamster embryonic stem cells by mutagenesis (19McLachlan J.A. Wong A. Degen G.H. Barrett J.C. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 3040-3045PubMed Google Scholar) and have been characterized as chondrocyte-like as they express collagen type II and IX mRNAs (20Cizdziel P.E. Hosoi J. Montgomery J.C. Wiseman R.W. Barrett J.C. Mol. Carcinog. 1991; 4: 14-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Transfection of these cells with the various constructs showed a pattern of secretion similar to that of COS-1 cells (Fig. 3). Only the constructs containing the CS-2 region but lacking a folding protein module failed to be efficiently secreted. The addition of EGF-1 or -2 modules to the construct with the CS-2 region and both LEC and CRP modules again resulted in the synthesis and secretion of the product. Even the addition of a single EGF-1 module to the CS-2 region was sufficient to give secretion of the protein into the medium well above that observed with CS-2 region alone, although over a number of transfections it appeared less efficient than with the other protein modules. This pattern of secretion of products was consistent between transfection experiments with DES4+.2 cells and COS-1 cells. The extended CS-2 region was poorly translocated and secreted if expressed on its own or together with the natural C-terminal sequence (t), but if it was attached to any of the folded protein modules in the G3 domain, this was sufficient to permit its translocation and secretion. However, no specific module was required for this to occur. In further transfection experiments in DES4+.2 cells, the CD33 signal sequence in the construct was replaced by the natural aggrecan signal sequence, but this had no effect on synthesis, or secretion, or on the apparent size of the products (not shown). There was therefore no suggestion that the signal sequence was responsible for directing the translated protein into different pathways. The size of the products expressed in transfected cells was larger than those produced by cell-free translation, and the size of most of the expressed products secreted in the medium of both cell types was larger than that in the cell layer (Fig. 4). These differences in size are likely to result from various processes of glycosylation in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi regions during translocation through the secretory pathway. The level of chondroitin sulfate synthesis on the secreted products was low, as chondroitinase ABC digestion only sharpened the main bands but caused little reduction in their apparent size (FIG. 2, FIG. 3, FIG. 4). The digested products were reactive with chondroitin sulfate monoclonal antibodies (23Couchman J.R. Caterson B. Christner J.E. Baker J.R. Nature. 1994; 307: 650-652Crossref Scopus (323) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5 A) and most reactive with that specific for 4-sulfated terminal disaccharide groups (Fig. 5 B). The level of chondroitin sulfate also showed no significant variation with constructs of different protein module composition. It thus appeared that only a fraction of the secreted products received some chondroitin sulfate chains during synthesis. A minor product band of faster mobility, which was reactive with the aggrecan antiserum and with CS antibodies, was seen with different constructs most prominantly in DES4+.2 cells (Fig. 3) and is likely to result from differences in glycosylation among the secreted products. The medium from the DES4+.2 cells contained additional bands of higher molecular weight reactive with the chondroitin sulfate monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 5, A and B). These bands were present in the medium from nontransfected control cells, but they did not react with the aggrecan specific JD5 antiserum (Fig. 5 A) and are therefore other proteoglycans. The cell layer products from transfected cells were not affected by chondroitinase digestion and were unreactive with CS antibodies, showing that they had no chondroitin sulfate attached. Digestion of the cell layer product from cells transfected with the CS.L.C.t construct with enzymes (endoglycosidase-F/peptide N-glycosidase F) that removeN-linked oligosaccharides reduced its size to that of the cell-free translation product (Fig. 4). Similar treatment of the secreted product after chondroitinase ABC digestion also reduced its size, but it remained significantly larger than the digested cell layer product.FIG. 5Detection of chondroitin sulfate on the secreted CS .L.C.t product expressed by DES4+.2 cells. A, secreted products from transfected cells (lanes 1 and 2) were immunolocalized with JD5 polyclonal antiserum. The secreted products of control (lanes 3 and4) and transfected cells (lanes 5 and6) were immunolocalized with chondroitin sulfate monoclonal antibodies (1B5, 2B6, 3B3). Samples in lanes 2,4, and 6 were treated with chondroitin ABC lyase. The CS.L.C.t product reacted with CS antibodies after chondroitinase digestion (lane 6). B, the secreted products of transfected cells were digested with chondroitin ABC lyase. The sample in lane 1 was immunolocalized with the mixed CS antibodies, and the samples in lanes 2, 3, and 4were immunolocalized with 1B5, 2B6, and 3B3, respectively (nonsulfate-, 4-sulfate-, and 6-sulfate-specific, respectively). The CS.L.C.t product is most positive for 4-sulfated disaccharides (lane 3). Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred, and immunolocalized as described under “Experimental Procedures.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) These results with human aggrecan cDNA constructs expressed in mammalian cells show that, as in the nanomelic chick, the extended CS-2 sequence is not translocated or secreted without a C-terminal folded protein motif. In the current study care has been taken in the preparation of constructs to splice all sequences of the folded protein modules at natural junctions to avoid interfering with their secondary or tertiary structure. Under these conditions, any of the protein modules predicted to fold in the G3 domain (24Brissett N.C. Perkins S.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) were able to facilitate secretion of the adjacent CS-2 region, and there was little detectable difference between the LEC and CRP modules in this function. These experiments on human aggrecan G3 expression show some results that differ from those reported (9Zheng J. Luo W. Tanzer M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12999-13006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) on chicken aggrecan G3 expression in Chinese hamster ovary cells, from which it was concluded that the LEC module was essential for the secretion of G3 constructs. In support of this, the interaction of the LEC module with chaperone Hsp-25 was demonstrated, and this highlighted the potentially important function of the chaperone in the folding of the LEC module and in facilitating its translocation to the Golgi and subsequent secretion. However, from the present results, the secretory role of LEC can be replaced by CRP and at least partly by the EGF modules. These protein modules may also interact with chaperones in the process of folding, and this may similarly facilitate secretion. Previous studies on aggrecan synthesis in chondrocytes have shown the protein to be in the ER for 20–30 min, during whichN-linked oligosaccharides are synthesized (25Kimura J.H. Lohmander S. Hascall V.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1984; 26: 261-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This is followed by more rapid translocation through the Golgi and by secretion within 5–10 min (26Campbell S.C. Schwarz N.B. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 28: 2191-2202Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Much evidence shows the addition of chondroitin sulfate and O-linked oligosaccharides to occur in the medial-trans-Golgi (27Ratcliffe A. Fryer P.R. Hardingham T.E. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 2355-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The absence of any attached chondroitin sulfate in the cell layer product (Fig. 5 A) suggests that most of the molecules in this fraction are in the ER and have not yet reached the medial/trans Golgi. The cell layer product was also shown to contain N-linked oligosaccharides, which supported its location within the ER and explained its increased size compared with the cell-free product. The size of the chondroitinase-digested culture medium product was reduced by the removal of N-linked oligosaccharides, but it remained larger than the cell layer product. This difference in size is likely to result from the residual chondroitin sulfate linkage region sugars and the presence of other O-linked oligosaccharides synthesized during transit through the Golgi before secretion. The relatively low level of chondroitin sulfate synthesis on the expressed constructs in both COS-1 cells and DES4+.2 cells may reflect a limited capacity for chondroitin sulfate synthesis. Neither cell type showed high endogenous levels of [35S]sulfate incorporation into proteoglycans (not shown). The amount of proteoglycan expressed in the transfected cells was therefore possibly too high for the efficient attachment of chondroitin sulfate. However, this is unlikely to have affected the pattern of secretion observed in this study, as transfection of chicken aggrecan G3 constructs in cells deficient in glycosaminoglycan synthesis has previously been shown to give similar results to transfection in normal cells (13Luo W. Kuwada T.S. Chandrasekaran L. Zheng J. Tanzer M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16447-16450Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). There are clearly important mechanisms within the cell (28Amara J.F. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 145-149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 29Hammond C. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar) that prevent unfolded proteins from leaving the rough endoplasmic reticulum and progressing along the secretory pathway when they have been miss-translated, miss-spliced, or are from a defective gene, such as the nanomelic chick aggrecan. The expression of proteins with unfolded and extended sequences may require protection from such mechanisms. In this study the presence of a single folded protein module attached C-terminal to the extended and unfolded CS-2 sequence appeared sufficient to avoid this surveillance and rejection mechanism. In this family of proteoglycans the extended sequences are positioned between folded domains. In their normal biosynthesis this structural arrangement may ensure that they avoid being mistaken for incorrectly expressed products. The capping of extended sequences with folded domains in secretory proteins may have evolved as part of a prerequisite for normal secretion. The results suggest that the LEC module in aggrecan G3 domain is not essential for aggrecan intracellular translocation and secretion. It is therefore likely that it is highly conserved within the C-terminal domains of the aggrecan family of proteoglycans for other reasons. Calcium-dependent interaction of the LEC module of all members of this family has been shown to occur with tenascin-R by binding to the fibronectin type III repeats (7Aspberg A. Miura R. Bourdoulous S. Shimonaka M. Heinegård D. Schachner M. Ruoslahti E. Yamaguchi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10116-10121Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Calcium-dependant interactions with carbohydrate ligands have also been detected (4Halberg D.F. Proulx G. Doege K. Yamada Y. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9486-9490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Saleque S. Ruiz N. Drickamer K. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 6Miura R. Aspberg A.

The LEC, CRP, and EGF-like modules may therefore together contribute to extracellular functions of the G3-like domains of the aggrecan family, and the alternative splicing of EGF-1 and EGF-2 may occur to modulate these functions.

https://openalex.org/W200979646,"We previously identified a significant increase in the content of calcineurin protein associated with calmodulin in failed human hearts, indicative of activation3. These data are consistent with a recent report in which calcineurin protein content was found to be increased in dilated cardiomyopathy in humans5. Since that report, we have invested considerable effort in dissecting the regulation of the three calcineurin catalytic genes in hypertrophied and failed heart. We have determined that both the CnA- and CnA- genes are expressed in the heart and that CnA-, but not CnA-, mRNA and protein are upregulated approximately 300% by hypertrophic agonist in cultured cardiomyocytes, and that enzymatic activity is increased to a similar extent6. In vivo, we have found that calcineurin protein content and catalytic activity are significantly increased in pressure-loaded rat hearts7. We have also re-evaluated calcineurin activation in failed human hearts using an enzymatic phosphatase assay. In eight control human left ventricular heart samples, calcineurin enzymatic activity was 100% 7%, compared with 171% 11% in twelve failed hearts ( P=0.007). This 71% increase in calcineurin enzymatic activity indicates that calcineurin activation is associated with human heart failure."

Nicoll D.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 678-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Hydropathy analysis of these proteins predicts 10 to 12 membrane-spanning α-helices organized into two clusters with a large intracellular loop present between the sixth and seventh hydrophobic domains (see Fig. 1 A). RodX has been cloned and sequenced from a number of species including cow (2Reilaender H. Achilles A. Friedel U. Maul G. Lottspeich F. Cook N.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1689-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), human, (3Tucker J.E. Winkfein R.J. Cooper C.B. Schnetkamp P.M.M. Investig. Ophthamol.

These retina-specific exchangers share extensive sequence homology in the hydrophobic domains and are less homologous in the two large hydrophilic domains. The large, N-terminal hydrophilic domain is extracellular and immediately follows the N-terminal signal sequence, distinguishing this class of cationic exchangers from others that do not contain this large hydrophilic loop. Recent data suggest that the second, cytosolic hydrophilic domain controls functional activity of the RodX when expressed in heterologous systems (4Cooper C.B. Winkfein R.J. Szerencsei R.T. Schnetkamp P.P.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6276-6283Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). There is no information regarding the functional role of the large extracellular domain of the RodX. Most proteins that span the membrane multiple times (referred to as polytopic membrane proteins), such as the RodX, do not contain cleaved signal sequences (5Friedlander M. Blobel G. Nature. 1985; 318: 338-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) (although there is no strict consensus, signal sequences tend to be 20 to 30 amino acids in length with a small amino acid at the −1 position (6von Heinje G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar)). These polytopic proteins contain internal, uncleaved signal sequences that serve to direct the proper targeting, translocation, and integration of membrane-spanning segments. These internal topogenic sequences may also function autonomously, directing the translocation or integration of a single transmembrane segment in the absence of the remainder of the protein. Several polytopic membrane proteins with cleaved signal sequences have been identified and include the acetylcholine receptor (7Anderson D.J. Walter P. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 501-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), lactose permease (8Kaback H.R. Friedlander M. Mueckler M. Molecular Biology of Receptors and Transporters.

Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 678-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Cloning of bovine RodX (bRodX)1 was reported by Reilaender et al. (2Reilaender H. Achilles A. Friedel U. Maul G. Lottspeich F. Cook N.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1689-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and the authors suggested that, similar to the cardiac exchanger, the N terminus may function as a cleaved signal sequence. If, in fact, the first 65 aa constitute a cleaved signal sequence, the large N-terminal hydrophilic domain would not be anchored to the membrane by a preceding transmembrane segment. If, on the other hand, the N terminal hydrophobic domain is not cleaved, the topology of this region of the protein would be significantly different, the large hydrophilic loop anchored to the membrane. Although the role of the N-terminal signal sequence in targeting and function of the RodX has not been studied, several studies of the sodium calcium exchanger from heart (10Sahin-Toth M. Nicoll D.A.

Chem. 1995; 270: 19345-19350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) demonstrate that disruption of the cleavage site or deletion of the signal sequence from the cardiac Na+/Ca2+ exchanger did not prevent membrane insertion or functional expression of the protein (10Sahin-Toth M. Nicoll D.A. Frank J.S. Philipson K.D. Friedlander M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 968-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that a cleaved N-terminal signal sequence is not required for folding and insertion of these exchangers into the membrane and support the concept that functional expression may be directed by internal topogenic signal sequences (5Friedlander M. Blobel G. Nature. 1985; 318: 338-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To study the role of the N-terminal hydrophobic domain in targeting and translocation of RodX, we generated three classes of modified RodX: 1) truncated constructs (bRodN) containing the coding sequence of RodX through the first putative transmembrane (or second hydrophobic) domain to study targeting and translocation in the absence of any internal signal sequences, 2) full-length exchanger with (bRodX) or without (bRodXΔ65) the first 65 aa to study the targeting of RodX without the native N terminus, and 3) chimeric proteins containing native bRodX N terminus or known cleaved signal sequences from β-lactamase. A more limited set of analogous constructs was generated with hRodX. Under no conditions did we observe cleavage of the N-terminal 65 aa of RodXin vitro. Furthermore, Western blot analysis of fresh bovine retinal membrane fractions using antipeptide antibodies directed against aa 10 to 19 or 179 to 194 of the bRod X resulted in the observation of an identically sized 210-kilodalton protein with either antibody. This indicates that the N terminus is present in at least a portion of RodX in vivo in bovine retina. The full-length cDNA of bRodX was a generous gift from Dr. Helmut Reilaender (Max-Planck-Institut fur Biophysik, Frankfurt/M, Germany). A series of full-length (bRodX) and truncated mutants (bRodN) were generated by a combination of PCR and subcloning methods. All constructs were sequenced to ensure that no mutations were introduced by PCR during amplification. bRodN constructs were generated (see Fig. 2 A) in which 1) the coding region for the first 65 aa was deleted (bRodNΔ65), 2) the putative cleavage site at Arg-65 was mutated to code for Ala (bRodN/R65A), or 3) the first 65 aa were replaced by the cleavable signal sequence of the canine cardiac sodium-calcium exchanger (bRodN/CXSS). The Δ65 mutant was generated by PCR using a 5′-oligonucleotide that contained the coding sequence for an initiator methionine. The R65A mutant was generated by two-stage PCR mutagenesis (overlap extension (13Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar)) to create the single amino acid change of Arg to Ala (nt CGG to GCG). The bRodN/CXSS fusion construct was generated by introducing a PvuII site by PCR silent mutagenesis into both the 3′ end of the coding sequence for the canine cardiac Na+/Ca2+ exchanger signal sequence and the 5′ end of the bRodX at aa 66. The fragments were digested with the appropriate enzymes and subcloned sequentially into the appropriate vector. All bRodN constructs were subcloned into the EcoRV and PstI sites of pSP72 (Promega). Termination codons were added to the bRodN constructs by PCR. A 3′ primer was designed to anneal to nt 1443–1449 was followed by the coding sequence for two stop codons and an XbaI site. This oligonucleotide and an SP6 primer were used to generate PCR fragments that were subsequently gel-purified, digested, and subcloned into pSP72. pSPSLGSTP (14Lingappa V.R. Katz F.N. Lodish H.F. Blobel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 8667-8670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was digested withBglII and NcoI to excise the β-lactamase signal sequence. The first 65 aa of RodX were amplified by PCR with oligonucleotide primers containing the appropriate restriction sites. The PCR product was digested and subcloned into the pSPSLGSTP vector. Plasmid DNA was prepared using the Qiaprep spin minikit (Qiagen). DNAs were digested with the appropriate restriction enzyme. Run-off transcripts were prepared per manufacturer's instructions using SP6 or T7 Message Machine kits (Ambion). RNA was quantified by gel electrophoresis or spectrophotometry. In vitro translations were performed using rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine (ICN Biochemicals). Proteins were translated in the presence or absence of dog pancreatic microsomal membranes (Promega) per manufacturer's instructions. A portion of the reactions carried out in the presence of membranes were subsequently treated with endoglycosidase H (Endo H) (New England Biolabs) to removeN-linked sugars. Samples were either precipitated with 2 volumes of saturated ammonium sulfate (Sigma) or fractionated. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Glycosylation and cleavage were assayed by mobility shift on SDS-PAGE. Fractionations were carried out as described by Borel and Simon (15Borel A.C. Simon S.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 379-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Briefly, 80% of the reaction was loaded onto a 115-μl 0.5 m/2.0 m sucrose cushion in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and centrifuged at 186,000 ×g for 15 min in a Beckman TLA 100.1 rotor. The 0.5m supernatant (S1) containing proteins not associated with membranes was removed. The 2.0 m sucrose cushion was extracted with urea (7 m final concentration) for 30 min on ice. The samples were then centrifuged at 280,000 × gfor 30 min. The supernatant (S2) containing membrane-associated, nonintegrated proteins was removed. Supernatant fractions were precipitated with two volumes of saturated ammonium sulfate. The remaining pellet (P) containing the proteins stably integrated into the membrane was resuspended in 1% sodium deoxycholate (Sigma), 0.1 n NaOH (Sigma). Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography and quantified using a Bio-Rad Molecular Imager. Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized corresponding to the coding sequence for the eighth and ninth hydrophobic domains of bRodX. A series of nested PCRs were performed using an adult human retinal library generously provided by Dr. Jeremy Nathans of Johns Hopkins University. Four DNA segments were amplified corresponding to nt 3362–3732, 3362–3693, 3382–3703, and 3464–3693 of the bovine sequence. The sequences of the fragments were 89–94% identical to the corresponding bovine sequence. The fragments were labeled by random priming (16Feinberg A.P. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 266-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (5169) Google Scholar) and used as probes to screen the library (17Dobner P.R. Barber D.L. Villa-Komaroff L. McKiernan C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3516-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Positive clones were plaque-purified and sequenced. Four clones corresponding to the coding sequence of the C-terminal half of the protein were identified. Primers were made to amplify the most 5′ portion of the most 5′ clone. Again, the PCR product was labeled by random priming and was used to rescreen the cDNA library. Two additional clones were identified. Using published sequence information (18Nicoll D.A. Applebury M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16207-16213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) oligonucleotide primers were synthesized to correspond to nt 1–22 and antisense 1500–1480. The 5′-end of the cDNA was amplified from the library by PCR. Three clones (nt 1–1500, 1162–2336, and 1975 to the end) were assembled into the full-length cDNA at the PstI (nt 1462) andEcoNI (nt 2058) sites. The full-length clone was inserted into the HindIII and XbaI sites of pSP73 (Promega). The full-length clone was sequenced by cycle sequencing using an automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) and found to be identical to the clone reported by Tucker et al. (3Tucker J.E. Winkfein R.J. Cooper C.B. Schnetkamp P.M.M. Investig. Ophthamol. Visual Sci. 1998; 39: 435-440PubMed Google Scholar). Constructs of the N-terminal portion of the human Rod X were generated in a similar fashion to the analogous bovine constructs. The 1–1500-nt fragment amplified from the library was subcloned into the pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen). Termination codons and an XbaI site were added after the sequence coding for aa 487 to generate a construct analogous to bRodN. The hRodN Δ65 mutant was generated by PCR using a 5′-oligonucleotide primer containing a HindIII site and an ATG for an initiator methionine fused to nt 198 to 208 and the 3′-primer with the termination codons used above. The amplified products were digested with HindIII and XbaI and subcloned into pSP73 (Promega). The Δ65 mutation was generated in full-length hRodX by amplifying the nt 1–1500 fragment from the library with a 5′-oligonucleotide described above and an oligonucleotide corresponding to antisense nt 1480–1500. The resulting PCR product was digested with PstI and HindIII and subcloned into the full-length construct digested with the same enzymes. All constructs were sequenced to determine that no mutations were introduced during amplification. Two peptides were synthesized corresponding to amino acids 10–19 and 179–194 of the bovine rod exchanger. Peptides were linked to keyhole lymphocyte hemocyanin and sent to Cocalico Biologicals, Inc. for antibody production in rabbits. Antibodies were tested for specificity by Western blots against recombinant GST fusion proteins fused to the peptide sequence. A crude retinal membrane extract was prepared as described by Nicoll and Applebury (18Nicoll D.A. Applebury M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16207-16213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, retinas were dissected on ice in a cold room from freshly enucleated bovine eyes and homogenized with 10 strokes using a motorized homogenizer in buffer (30% sucrose, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 65 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2) with a complete mixture of protease inhibitors (aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Particulate matter was removed by centrifugation at 2000 × g. The supernatant was diluted with 2 volumes of 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4 with fresh protease inhibitors. The membranes were recovered from the supernatant by centrifugation at 10,000 × g. The pellet was resuspended in the same buffer as above with fresh protease inhibitors, separated into aliquots, and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose (Micron Separations, Inc.) using a Bio-Rad Protean II. Blots were stained with Ponceau S (Sigma) to evaluate protein transfer. Stain was removed with TBST (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20). Blots were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST for 60 min, rinsed twice in TBST, and incubated with immune or preimmune sera in 3% bovine serum albumin in TBST for 2 h. Blots were washed 6 times for 5 min in TBST and incubated in peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (whole molecule) F(ab′)2 goat antibody (Sigma) in 3% bovine serum albumin in TBST. The blots were then washed 8 times for 5 min in TBST. Bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). bRodX is a polytopic membrane protein predicted to contain 12 transmembrane domains by Kyte-Dolittle hydropathy analysis (Fig. 1 A) (19Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16899) Google Scholar). In preliminary experiments, full-length bRodX was translated in the presence and absence of microsomal membranes. A decrease in the mobility of the translation product was observed in the presence of microsomal membranes due to glycosylation by glycosyltransferases present in the lumen of the microsomal vesicles (Fig. 1 B). A portion of the reaction carried out in the presence of membranes was treated with EndoH to remove carbohydrate moieties in order to detect mobility shifts on SDS-PAGE indicative of protein cleavage. Treatment of the reaction mixture with Endo H returned the product to the mobility of the primary translation product. No cleavage could be detected. Since the change in molecular weight upon processing of the full-length protein is small relative to the total molecular mass of the protein, we prepared a truncated RodX consisting of the first 483 aa only (Fig. 2 A) to 1) make mobility shifts more readily detectable and 2) better evaluate the role of the N terminus as a signal sequence in the absence of any internal signal sequences. Experiments using further truncated cDNAs lacking the coding region for the second hydrophobic domain were performed. They demonstrated that the second hydrophobic domain was not sufficient to direct membrane translocation. In the presence of membranes, bRodN was translocated across the membrane as evidenced by a decrease in mobility due to glycosylation (Fig. 2 B, compare lanes 2 and 3). After treatment with EndoH, the protein returned to the size of the primary translation product, indicating that the protein was not cleaved. Experiments with the N-terminal-deleted RodNΔ65 mutant demonstrated that the first 65 aa were required to direct the translocation of the N terminus across the membrane. The translation product was the same size whether or not microsomal membranes were present (Fig. 2 B,lanes 5 to 7). Cleaved signal sequences generally have a small aa in the −1 position relative to the cleavage site (6von Heinje G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar). To determine if the Arg in the −1 position inhibited cleavage, we mutated it to an Ala. This mutation of the previously reported signal sequence cleavage site (R65A) did not affect the targeting or translocation of RodN (Fig. 2 B, compare lanes 2to 4 with lanes 8 to 10). Having determined that the presence but not the cleavage of the first 65 aa of RodX were required for targeting and translocation of the N terminus, we wanted to determine if a known cleaved signal sequence could substitute for the first 65 aa of RodX. A chimeric construct was prepared in which the cleaved signal sequence from the canine cardiac Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (10Sahin-Toth M. Nicoll D.A. Frank J.S. Philipson K.D. Friedlander M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 968-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) was fused in-frame to aa 66–483 of bRodN. Translation of this chimeric protein in the presence of microsomal membranes produced a slight decrease in the mobility of the translation product (Fig. 2 B, comparelanes 11 and 12); treatment with EndoH resulted in an increase in mobility when compared with the primary translation product. The translation product had a mobility similar to the primary translation product of the Δ65 mutant (Fig. 2 B, comparelanes 5 and 13. The minimal change in mobility in the presence of microsomal membranes is explained by the decrease of the mobility due to glycosylation being offset by the increase in mobility due to the cleavage of the N-terminal signal sequence. A similar effect is observed when the native cardiac Na+/Ca2+ exchanger is translated in the presence of the microsomal membranes in vitro (20Hryshko L.V. Nicoll D.A. Weiss J.N. Philipson K.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1151: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Human RodX constructs analogous to bRodN and bRodNΔ65 were prepared to determine if the first 65 aa functioned similarly in the human isoform. Results from coupled translation/translocation experiments with the hRodN were identical to bRodN (Fig. 2 C) as were results from experiments using full-length RodX (data not shown). Our observation that RodXΔ65 was not glycosylated in the presence of microsomal membranes could be explained by 1) the protein not being targeted to the membrane or 2) the protein being inserted in reverse orientation such that the glycosylation sites were outside of the vesicle and not accessible to the glycosyltransferases. To distinguish between these two possibilities, translation reactions were fractionated over sucrose cushions and extracted with urea to distinguish stably integrated proteins (P) from ones peripherally associated with the membrane or in the translocation channel (S2) (21Gilmore R. Blobel G. Cell. 1985; 42: 497-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Fractionations were carried out in the presence and absence of microsomal membranes. A small fraction of translation product was always found in the pellet (P) fraction in the absence of membranes due to nonspecific aggregation of hydrophobic stretches present in these proteins (5Friedlander M. Blobel G. Nature. 1985; 318: 338-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Constructs containing only the N terminus of the exchanger through the second hydrophobic domain were used to investigate the role of the first 65 aa independently of any internal signal sequences. In the absence of membranes, nearly 75% of bRodN was found in the S1 fraction (Fig. 3 A, comparelane 2 to lane 4; Fig. 3 B). Upon the addition of membranes, the protein was found almost exclusively in the P fraction (Fig. 3 A, lane 8, and B). Both in the presence and the absence of membranes, the Rod N Δ65 mutant was found predominantly in the S1 fraction (Fig. 3 A,lanes 10 and 14, and B). Quantification of fractionation experiments showed no difference in the proportion of the reaction product in the P fractions of bRodN without membranes and both bRodNΔ65 without and with membranes (Tukey test,p > 0.05) (Fig. 3 B). The portion of the reaction product in the P fraction of the bRodN fraction with membranes was significantly different (p < 0.001). These data indicate that the lack of glycosylation of the N terminus is due to a targeting defect rather than the N terminus being inserted in reverse orientation. Experiments performed with the hRodN constructs yielded similar results (data not shown). To determine if RodX contains internal signal sequences sufficient to target it to the membrane, we fractionated full-length RodX with and without the first 65 aa. Proteins were translated in vitro and fractionated as above. The full-length exchanger with and without the first 65 aa targets to the membrane and becomes stably integrated (Fig. 4 A, compare lanes 8and 16). We observed a portion of the translation product in the P fractions even in the absence of membranes (lanes 4and 12) as discussed above. Phosphoimager analysis revealed that there was no difference in the fractionation pattern of the full-length and N-terminal-deleted protein (Fig. 4 B). No change in the mobility of the Δ65 mutant was ever observed upon translation in the presence of membranes. Thus, in the absence of the N-terminal 65 aa, RodX was stably inserted into the membrane, but the appropriate final topology was never attained. Experiments performed with the hRodX constructs produced similar results (data not shown). The coding sequence for the first 65 aa RodX were fused in-frame to a cDNA encoding a chimeric protein containing a portion of the globin gene with an engineered glycosylation site, a stop transfer sequence from immunoglobulin M heavy chain, and a portion of prolactin. In the presence of microsomal membranes, chimeric protein was targeted and translocated across the membrane as evidenced by a decrease in mobility in the presence of membranes (Fig. 5 B, comparelanes 2 and 3). Treatment with EndoH resulted in an increased mobility when compared with the primary translation product (Fig. 5 B, compare lanes 2 and4), indicating that the protein was cleaved. When the N-terminal 65 aa of RodX were used in the place of the β-lactamase signal sequence, no cleavage was observed (Fig. 5 B, comparelanes 5 and 7); however the N terminus of the protein was translocated as evidenced by its glycosylation in the presence of microsomal membranes (compare lanes 5 and 6). Translocation was not due to the immunoglobulin M stop transfer sequence. Identical results were observed with a construct in which truncation occurred at the end of the globin coding sequence (data not shown). Thus, the first 65 aa of RodX can function as an uncleaved N-terminal signal sequence in both heterologous, as well as native, contexts. To determine if the first 65 aa are cleaved from bovine RodX in vivo, we prepared crude bovine retinal extracts for analysis by Western blot using antipeptide antibodies raised to both the N terminus (aa 10–19) and an internal portion of the protein (aa 179–194). Conditions were selected to minimize proteolysis by preparing a crude extract to reduce preparation time, conducting the entire procedure in the cold room, and using a broad range of protease inhibitors in the buffers. Using an antibody directed against either the N terminus (aa 10–19) or an internal sequence (aa 179–194), an identical, single band of approximately 210 kDa was detected by Western blots (Fig. 6). A lower molecular weight species was not detected. Since the wild type, full-length native RodX has an apparent molecular mass of 210 kDa by SDS-PAGE and the cleaved form, a predicted molecular mass of 203 kDa, we interpret these data to indicate that the majority of the native RodX purified from fresh photoreceptors is not cleaved at aa 65. These in vivo data support our in vitro observation that the N-terminal 65 aa of RodX serve as an uncleaved signal sequence. Multiple attempts to obtain N-terminal sequence of RodX freshly purified from bovine retina in our laboratory revealed that the N terminus is blocked and not available for sequencing (data not shown). In this study we report that the first 65 aa of RodX constitute an uncleaved signal sequence sufficient to target the protein to microsomal vesicles; in addition, the first 65 aa of RodX are required to translocate the N-terminal hydrophilic domain across the membrane. Translocation of the N terminus could also be directed by the cleaved N-terminal signal sequence from the cardiac Na+/Ca2+ exchanger signal sequence. It is also of interest to note that although the native N-terminal signal sequence is uncleaved, the cardiac Na+/Ca2+ signal sequence, when fused to Rod X Δ65, could be cleaved in vitro, consistent with its behavior in the native cardiac Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. Last, the first 65 aa of bRodX also function as an uncleaved signal sequence in a heterologous context, targeting globin, a soluble cytosolic protein, to microsomal membranes. Deletion of the first 65 aa from a truncated form of both hRodN and bRodN results in a protein that does not associate with microsomal vesicles. In the context of the full-length protein though, the N-terminal 65 aa are not required for targeting and insertion of the protein into the membrane. RodXΔ65 is targeted to the membrane as efficiently as the full-length protein, but the N-terminal hydrophilic domain is never translocated as evidenced by a lack of glycosylation. Hence, the protein is stably integrated into the membrane, yet it never attains the correct, final topology. In the absence of the first 65 aa of RodX, the N-terminal 382 aa preceding the first transmembrane domain would have to be translocated post-translationally, as opposed to co-translationally, in the presence of a signal sequence. This type of post-translational translocation occurs in type III proteins that contain no N-terminal signal sequence but instead contain a C-terminal membrane anchor. Unlike RodXΔ65 though, the protein segment preceding the first transmembrane domain is small, usually less than 100 aa in length (22Kutay U. Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 72-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Post-translational translocation through membranes requires chaperones in the case of mitochondria (23Hajek P. Koh J.Y. Jones L. Bedwell D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7169-7177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as in yeast (24McClellan A.J. Endres J.B. Vogel J.P. Palazzi D. Rose M.D. Brodsky J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3533-3545Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and bacteria (25Driessen A.J. Fekkes P. van der Wolk J.P. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1998; 1: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). These cytosolic chaperones maintain the protein in an unfolded, translocation competent structure. As the large hydrophilic loop of RodX would normally be translated with the ribosome attached to the translocation machinery, it would not interact with cytosolic proteins. It is unlikely that cytosolic chaperone binding sites would be present in the loop. In the absence of endoplasmic reticulum resident chaperones, proteins that normally fold in the endoplasmic reticulum aggregate; hence, they would be unavailable for translocation (26Haynes R.L. Sheng T. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17126-17133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We did not observe cleavage of the N terminus of bRodX in vivo as evidenced by Western blot analysis of freshly prepared total retinal extracts. Earlier reports describing the cloning of RodX suggested that the cleavage at Asp-66 could have been the result of a nonspecific proteolysis during purification of the protein (2Reilaender H. Achilles A. Friedel U. Maul G. Lottspeich F. Cook N.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1689-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar); such a cleavage during purification would result in an unblocked N terminus, which would be available for N-terminal sequencing. These data do not preclude the possibility that a portion of RodX is not cleaved in vivo but suggest that any such cleavage would most likely not be due to a signal peptidase cleavage event. The requirement of an uncleaved signal sequence on Rod X in order for the protein to be correctly targeted and translocated across microsomal membranes distinguishes it from other cation exchangers that are able to functionally insert into the membrane in the absence of an N-terminal signal sequence (10Sahin-Toth M. Nicoll D.A. Frank J.S. Philipson K.D. Friedlander M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 968-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 11Furman I. Cook O. Kasir J. Low W. Rahaminoff H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19120-19127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 12Loo T.W. Ho C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19345-19350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This difference may be due to the presence of the large N-terminal hydrophilic domain present between the first and second hydrophobic segments of RodX. The topological information in the first transmembrane domain may be sufficient to direct the translocation of a short N terminus across the membrane in the absence of an N-terminal signal sequence (as in the cardiac exchanger) but not adequate for a segment as long as that of the rod exchanger. Further studies will need to be performed to determine if the requirement for a noncleaved signal sequence is dependent upon the length of the protein segment that must be translocated across the membrane or if it is a peculiarity of retinal-specific proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2475751872,"A lthough paired organs such as the kidney and the lung are neatly arranged on each side of the body's midline, other tissues such as the heart and the liver prefer to be on either the left or the right. But how does a developing embryo ensure that, for example, the tube of mesodermal tissue that will eventually form the heart, curves to the left of the body's axis? Recent findings by Okada et al. ([1][1]) add to growing evidence that the clockwise rotation of cilia on embryonic nodal cells is the initial event that determines the asymmetric placement of certain organs.

Nodal cells, each bearing a single cilium, are clustered in a triangular pit (node) that first appears as the neural plate is laid down (at day 7.5 of mouse embryonic development). In work published last year ([2][2]), Okada and colleagues reported that in mice lacking either the KIF3A or KIF3B motor protein kinesins, the asymmetry of organ placement was random ([2][2]). These two proteins (together with KAP3) form a complex that transports structural components of the cilium along its hollow interior. Animals deficient in either KIF3A or KIF3B are devoid of cilia.

In their new work ([1][1]), the Japanese group decided to investigate why the organs of the iv and inv mutant mouse strains are in abnormal locations. In the iv strain, which carries a mutation in a gene encoding dynein (a component of ciliary architecture), the location of organs is randomly asymmetric, whereas in inv mice (which carry a mutation in the inv gene, whose function is unknown), organ placement is completely reversed. The investigators suspected that a defect in nodal cilia could be the culprit common to both abnormalities.

To test their hypothesis, they analyzed movement of nodal cilia with a video fluorescence microscope, following the trajectory of fluorescent beads chemically attached to the ends of the cilia (large green circle in figure). The movement of unattached fluorescent beads (green spots in figure) revealed how ciliary motion altered the flow of extraembryonic fluid in the node. The authors discovered that, unlike nodal cilia in normal mice that rotated clockwise (apparently in synchrony), those in iv mice were motionless. The normal clockwise rotation of nodal cilia moved the fluid to the left of the node but, in the absence of ciliary movement, there was no fluid flow. In inv mice, the cilia appeared to rotate normally, but a closer look revealed that they were moving asynchronously. This, together with an abnormality in the shape of the node, generated turbulence in the fluid flow.

Intriguingly, nodal fluid flow begins about the time that left-right determination of tissue location first becomes manifest; asymmetric expression of left- or right-determining genes such as lefty-2 soon follows. The Japanese group speculated that the fluid might contain morphogens (molecules that dictate development of embryonic tissues) that would accumulate on the lefthand side of the node, driven by the clockwise rotation of the cilia. Accumulation of sufficient morphogen would induce expression of genes in ventral node cells, which would then direct expression of left- or right-determining genes in adjacent mesodermal cells (these are the cells that will eventually develop into organs).

Next, Okada and collaborators plan to identify the fluid morphogens and to alter left-right determination in mouse embryos by mechanically perturbing fluid flow.
