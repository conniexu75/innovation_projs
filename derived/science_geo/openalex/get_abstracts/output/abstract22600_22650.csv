https://openalex.org/W1531522492,"The intracellular concentration of the 27-kDa mammalian heat shock protein, HSP27, increases several-fold after heat and other metabolic stresses and is closely associated with the acquisition of thermotolerance. Posttranslational modifications may also affect the function of HSP27. Heat shock of HeLa cell cultures, or treatment with arsenite, phorbol ester, or tumor necrosis factor, caused a rapid phosphorylation of preexisting HSP27 and the appearance of three phosphorylated isoforms, HSP27 B, C, and D. Digestion with trypsin and fractionation of the peptides by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography revealed three 32P-labeled phosphopeptides. Microsequence analysis identified peak I as Ala76-Leu77-Ser78-Arg79 and peak II as Gln80-Leu81-Ser82-Ser83-Gly84-Val85- Ser86-Glu87-Ile88-Arg89; peak III contained the undigested peptide pair Ala76-Arg89. Ser82 was the major site and Ser78 the minor site of phosphorylation. Mutant proteins with Ser78 or Ser82 altered to glycine or Ser78-Ser82 double mutants were phosphorylated to reduced extents in vivo after heat or arsenite treatment. Ser78 and Ser82 (and Ser15) occur in the sequence motif RXXS, which is recognized by ribosomal protein S6 kinase II. Mitogenic stimulation of serum-deprived, Go-arrested Chinese hamster cells with serum, thrombin, or fibroblast growth factor also stimulated phosphorylation of HSP27 Ser78 and Ser82, and mitogenic stimulation and heat shock activated protein kinase activities that phosphorylated HSP27 and protein S6 in vitro. These results suggest that HSP27 may exert phosphorylation-activated functions linked with growth signaling pathways in unstressed cells. A homeostatic function at this level could protect cells from adverse effects of signal transduction systems which may be activated inappropriately during stress."
https://openalex.org/W1510158417,"Long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase was extracted from the washed membrane fraction of frozen rat liver mitochondria with buffer containing detergent and then was purified. This enzyme is an oligomer with a molecular mass of 460 kDa and consisted of 4 mol of large polypeptide (79 kDa) and 4 mol of small polypeptides (51 and 49 kDa). The purified enzyme preparation was concluded to be free from the following enzymes based on marked differences in behavior of the enzyme during purification, molecular masses of the native enzyme and subunits, and immunochemical properties: enoyl-CoA hydratase, short-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, peroxisomal enoyl-CoA hydratase/3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase bifunctional protein, and mitochondrial and peroxisomal 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolases. The purified enzyme exhibited activities toward enoyl-CoA hydratase and 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase together with the long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity. The carbon chain length specificities of these three activities of this enzyme differed from those of the other enzymes. Therefore, it is concluded that this enzyme is not long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase; rather, it is enoyl-CoA hydratase/3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase/3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase trifunctional protein."
https://openalex.org/W1577890972,"Transcriptional initiator elements and TATA elements are functionally similar, in that both can act in concert with a Sp1-dependent activator element to direct high levels of accurately initiated transcription. In this study, we have used in vitro transcription experiments to elucidate the relative activities of TATA and initiator. By varying the locations of TATA and initiator elements within a simple promoter, we compared their abilities to localize transcription start sites and to mediate transcriptional activation by Sp1. In addition, we addressed the contributions of initiator and TATA towards determining the direction of transcription from a promoter. Finally, we addressed the prevalence of initiator elements by analyzing the start site regions of several genes. We found that many of these regions possess initiator activity, although an initiator consensus sequence could not be defined. Taken together, the data presented suggest that an initiator is a common element that can influence the direction of transcription as well as the location of a transcription start site. However, in general, an initiator was incapable of altering these activities of a TATA box within a promoter containing both core elements."
https://openalex.org/W2127265772,"To better understand assembly mechanisms of progesterone receptor (PR) complexes, we have developed a cell-free system for studying PR interactions with the 90- and 70-kDa heat shock proteins (hsp90 and hsp70), and we have used this system to examine requirements for hsp90 binding to PR. Purified chick PR, free of hsp90 and immobilized on an antibody affinity resin, will rebind hsp90 in rabbit reticulocyte lysate when several conditions are met. These include: 1) absence of progesterone, 2) elevated temperature (30 degrees C), 3) presence of ATP, and 4) presence of Mg2+. We have obtained maximal hsp90 binding to receptor when lysate is supplemented with 3 mM MgCl2 and an ATP-regenerating system. ATP depletion of lysate by dialysis or by enzymatic means blocks hsp90 binding to PR; likewise, addition of EDTA to lysate blocks hsp90 binding, but binding is restored by the addition of excess Mg2+. Addition to lysate of monoclonal antibody against hsp70 inhibits hsp90 binding to PR and destabilizes preformed complexes. Stabilization of hsp90-receptor complexes also requires ATP, indicating that ATP and hsp70 are needed to form and to maintain hsp90 complexes. Hormone-dependent activation of reconstituted receptor complexes was also examined. The addition of progesterone to the reticulocyte lysate promotes dissociation of hsp90 and hsp70 from the receptor. This also appears to require ATP and dissociation is most efficient in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system. In conclusion, these studies indicate that PR-hsp90 complexes do not self-assemble; instead, assembly is probably a multistep process requiring ATP and other cellular factors."
https://openalex.org/W1551351047,"The genetic determinants of enterobacterial common antigen (ECA) include the rfe and rff genes located between ilv and cya near min 85 on the Escherichia coli chromosome. The rfe-rff gene cluster of E. coli K-12 was cloned in the cosmid pHC79. The cosmid clone complemented mutants defective in the synthesis of ECA due to lesions in the rfe, rffE, rffD, rffA, rffC, rffT, and rffM genes. Restriction endonuclease mapping combined with complementation studies of the original cosmid clone and six subclones revealed the order of genes in this region to be rfe-rffD/rffE-rffA/rffC-rffT-rffM . The rfe gene was localized to a 2.54-kilobase ClaI fragment of DNA, and the complete nucleotide sequence of this fragment was determined. The nucleotide sequencing data revealed two open reading frames, ORF-1 and ORF-2, located on the same strand of DNA. The putative initiation codon of ORF-1 was found to be 570 nucleotides downstream from the termination codon of rho. ORF-1 and ORF-2 specify putative proteins of 257 and 348 amino acids with calculated Mr values of 29,010 and 39,771, respectively. ORF-1 was identified as the rfe gene since ORF-1 alone was able to complement defects in the synthesis of ECA and 08-side chain synthesis in rfe mutants of E. coli. Data are also presented which suggest the possibility that the rfe gene is the structural gene for the tunicamycin sensitive UDP-GlcNAc:undecaprenylphosphate GlcNAc-1-phosphate transferase that catalyzes the synthesis of GlcNAc-pyrophosphorylundecaprenol (lipid I), the first lipid-linked intermediate involved in ECA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1555368961,"Adenylylcyclase cannot be activated by hormones or guanine nucleotide analogs in membranes from cells that express the G226A mutant form Gs alpha instead of the wild-type protein. The mutant Gs alpha protein appears incapable of undergoing the conformational change necessary for guanine nucleotide-induced dissociation of the G protein alpha subunit from the beta gamma subunit complex (Miller, R.T., Masters, S.B., Sullivan, K.A., Beiderman, B., and Bourne, H.R. (1988) Nature 334, 712-715). G226A Gs alpha was synthesized in Escherichia coli, purified, and characterized. Examination of the kinetics of dissociation of guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) suggests that G226A Gs alpha is incapable of assuming the conformation necessary for high affinity binding of Mg2+ to the alpha subunit-GTP gamma S complex. Associated changes include the failure of Mg2+ and GTP gamma S to confer resistance to tryptic proteolysis upon the protein, to enhance intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, or to cause dissociation of alpha from beta gamma. However, the GTPase activity of the mutant protein is near normal (at high Mg2+ concentrations), and the protein is capable of activating adenylylcyclase. A similar defect is present in G49V Gs alpha. Failure of G protein subunit dissociation appears to be the explanation for the phenotypic properties of cells that express G226A Gs alpha, and this mutation thus highlights the crucial nature of this reaction as a component of G protein action."
https://openalex.org/W2096258929,"The mRNA level of the two Xenopus laevis hormone receptor beta (TR beta) genes is up-regulated in tadpoles and cultured cells by the addition of hormone (TH). Up-regulation of transcripts of the 5' most exon is detectable 2-3 h before that of full-length TR beta mRNA, strongly suggesting that up-regulation is under transcriptional control. The TH-induced up-regulation in cultured cells is inhibited by cycloheximide when measured either by a transcription initiation assay that measures transcripts of the 5' most exon or by synthesis of full-length TR beta mRNA. From this we conclude that in cultured cells protein synthesis is required for up-regulation of TR beta mRNA. The up-regulation of TR beta mRNA by TH in tadpoles is only partially inhibited by protein synthesis inhibitors. A survey of thyroid genes in the literature reveals that the reported change in gene expression is, in most cases, sensitive to protein synthesis inhibition. This is true of genes with demonstrable hormone response elements. If an unknown protein must be synthesized to effect up-regulation of a hormone response gene, it calls into question assays that only take into account the binary reaction between hormone receptor and a putative hormone response element."
https://openalex.org/W1499162785,"Abstract Transcripts from several genes encoded in the Trypanosoma brucei maxicircle genome are altered by posttranscriptional uridine insertion and deletion through a process called RNA editing. We find that transcripts from the CR6 gene are extensively edited by addition of 132 uridines and deletion of 28 uridines to produce a fully edited mRNA 47% larger than unedited mRNA. Two open reading frames (ORFs) and their initiation and termination codons are created by editing of CR6 mRNA. Both ORFs specify small, hydrophobic proteins with no homology to proteins in three databases. Both unedited and edited CR6 transcripts are more abundant in bloodstream form than in procyclic form parasites. cDNA clones spanning both CR6 and the downstream NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 (ND5) gene were isolated, indicating that mature CR6 and ND5 transcripts arise from a common precursor. Sequencing of these cDNAs revealed 37 nucleotides of overlap between the 3' end of CR6 and the 5' end of ND5. In addition, the CR6 portion of many of these molecules was extensively edited, indicating that RNA editing can precede precursor processing. These results provide the first clear demonstration of polycistronic transcription of maxicircle genes, and suggest new mechanisms by which both RNA editing and precursor processing may regulate maxicircle gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1521510973,"Treatment of quiescent primary human fibroblasts with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, TNF-beta, interleukin-1, interferon (IFN) alpha, IFN beta, or IFN gamma induced Egr-1 mRNA. In primary human fibroblasts TNF-alpha and TNF-beta were mildly mitogenic and IFN alpha and IFN gamma were growth inhibitory. However, in HeLa cells TNF but not IFN induced the expression of Egr-1 mRNA, while both cytokines inhibited HeLa cell division. Kinetic measurements of Egr-1 gene expression showed that TNF-alpha, TNF-beta, and IFN gamma increased the cellular concentration of Egr-1 mRNA within 30 min. A maximum induction of Egr-1 mRNA was detected at approximately 60 min which dropped to basal level by 180 min. Induction was inhibited by H7 and staurosporine but not by HA1004, indicating the involvement of a functional protein kinase C. The Egr-1 message was translated and the cellular Egr-1 protein detected within 60 min of cytokine treatment. Despite similar Egr-1 mRNA induction, the amount of Egr-1 protein translated in IFN alpha- and IFN gamma-treated cells was lower than in those treated with TNF-alpha and TNF-beta, and highest in the EGF-treated primary human fibroblasts. Indeed, the level of Egr-1 protein translated in these cells correlated proportionally with both the phosphorylation of cap-binding protein (eukaryotic initiation factor) and the amount of cellular DNA synthesis in the variously treated fibroblasts. These results suggest that both growth stimulatory and inhibitory cytokines can regulate Egr-1 gene expression at the transcriptional and translational level. However, the combination of these regulatory controls may determine the cellular concentration of the Egr-1 gene product and hence, its effect on cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1539582413,"The Raf-1 proto-oncogene protein kinase can be phosphorylated and activated after stimulation of cells with insulin and a variety of other growth factors and mitogens. We recently presented evidence that insulin and certain other growth factors activated one or more Raf-1 kinase kinase activities (Lee, R.M., Rapp, U. R., and Blackshear, P.J. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 10351-10357). In the present study, four peaks of Raf-1 kinase kinase activity were identified after anion-exchange chromatography of cell lysates, and two of these were activated by insulin. Further chromatographic characterization of these two peaks of insulin-activated kinase activity indicated that they contained three apparently distinct kinase activities. Two of these activities comigrated with immunoreactive extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) 1 and 2 (mitogen-activated protein kinase) through three different chromatographic separations. Both ERK1 and ERK2 phosphorylated Raf-1 with reasonably high affinity (Km for ERK1 = 90 nM; Km for ERK2 = 120 nM), and produced similar, complex phosphopeptide maps; both kinases also phosphorylated myelin basic protein. The third kinase activity also phosphorylated Raf-1 and myelin basic protein but did not comigrate exactly with either immunoreactive ERK1 or ERK2. We conclude that two and possibly three insulin-activated Raf-1 kinase kinases are members of the ERK family."
https://openalex.org/W1514194392,"Abstract Polymerase chain reaction techniques have been used to isolate a cDNA clone containing the entire protein coding region of thromboxane A2 synthase (EC 5.3.99.5) from a human lung cDNA library. The cDNA clone hybridizes with a single 2.1-kilobase mRNA species in phorbol ester-induced human erythroleukemia and monocytic leukemia cell lines. A second cDNA, differing only by an insert of 163 base pairs near the 3'-end of the translated region, was also found to be present in the same library. The proteins predicted from both nucleic acid sequences include the three polypeptide sequences determined from amino acid sequencing of the purified human platelet enzyme, five potential sites for N-glycosylation, and a hydrophobic region that may serve to anchor the synthase in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. The longer predicted protein, designated thromboxane synthase-I, contains 534 amino acids, with a Mr of 60,684, whereas the shorter protein, designated thromboxane synthase-II, contains 460 amino acids and has a Mr of 52,408. Although thromboxane synthase-II lacks the conserved cysteine that serves as the proximal heme ligand in the other cytochromes, significant sequence similarities exist among thromboxane synthase-I and -II and several P450s, particularly those in family 3. The overall amino acid identity is considerably less than 40%, making it likely that thromboxane synthase represents a previously undefined family of cytochrome P450."
https://openalex.org/W1950027480,"Maxadilan is a potent vasodilator peptide released into the skin when the sand fly Lutzomyia longipalpis, an important vector of leishmania, probes for a blood meal. As several lines of evidence suggest that this peptide may play a critical role in the enhancement of leishmania infectivity attributed to sand fly saliva, the peptide has been proposed as a candidate antigen for a leishmanial vaccine. Although maxadilan is the most potent vasodilator peptide known and shares several properties with calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), studies of its structure, physiological effects, and biological roles have been limited by the miniscule quantities available. Here we report the isolation of cDNA and genomic DNA clones that encode maxadilan. The predicted translation product shows no significant homology with any previously isolated proteins. The coding DNA has been expressed in Escherichia coli and the purified recombinant peptide is biologically active with a specific activity comparable to the natural peptide. Recombinant maxadilan will be useful in studies of vascular biology and could lead to novel therapeutic and prophylactic agents."
https://openalex.org/W1483306026,"Each of the two Xenopus laevis thyroid hormone receptor beta genes is at least 70 kilobases in length with similar intron-exon organization. There are up to eight alternatively spliced exons in the 5'-untranslated region. Excluding the extreme amino terminus, each receptor is encoded by six exons spanning about 6 kilobases of the genome, in which each of the two zinc fingers that comprise the DNA-binding domain is encoded by a separate exon and the hormone-binding domain is split into three exons. The last exon of the coding region also contains at least 600 base pairs of the 3'-untranslated region, which is about 8 kilobases. Each of the receptor genes has two promoters and just one of them is up-regulated in tadpoles by the administration of thyroid hormone."
https://openalex.org/W1493004256,"The alpha subunits of the heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins Gi1, Gi2, Gi3, G0, and Gs have been overexpressed in Sf9 cells using a baculovirus expression system. The Gi1 alpha, Gi2 alpha, Gi3 alpha, and G0 alpha have been purified to homogeneity from infected Spodoptera frugiperda (SF9) cells and characterized. Yields of up to 1.8 mg of purified recombinant G alpha have been obtained from 300-ml cultures of infected cells. The recombinant alpha subunits are myristoylated and are ADP-ribosylated by pertussis toxin only in the presence of beta gamma subunits. They bind guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) with low nM dissociation constants and stoichiometries of 0.8 mol/mol or greater. The rGi1 alpha, rGi2 alpha, and rGi3 alpha are capable of interacting with angiotensin II receptors based on their ability to restore high affinity angiotensin II binding in rat liver membranes shifted to a low affinity state with GTP gamma S."
https://openalex.org/W1494174270,"A DNA fragment containing the gene encoding subunit C of vaculor H(+)-ATPase (V-ATPase) was cloned from a yeast library. The predicted amino acid sequence indicated that the C subunit consists of 373 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 42,287 Da. The protein from yeast is 37 identical in its amino acid sequence to the C subunit of bovine V-ATPase. The DNA fragment that was cloned in this study contained two additional reading frames. At the 5' end an amino acid sequence that is homologous to Artemia elongation factor 1 was detected. At the 3' end the N-terminal part of a kinesin-like protein was observed. The gene encoding subunit C of the V-ATPase was interrupted, and the resulting mutant could not grow at high pH and was sensitive to low and high Ca2+ concentrations in the growth medium. Transformation of the mutant by a plasmid containing the gene encoding subunit C repaired the phenotype of the mutant. Substitution of more than half of the coding region by a corresponding DNA fragment encoding the bovine subunit C resulted in a phenotype indistinguishable from wild type. Immunological studies with the disruptant mutant revealed that subunit C is necessary for the assembly of the catalytic sector of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1588140627,"Abstract We have isolated cDNA clones encoding the core protein of PG-Lb, proteoglycan which has been shown to be preferentially expressed in the zone of flattened chondrocytes of the developing chick limb cartilage (Shinomura, T., Kimata, K., Oike, Y., Yano, S., and Suzuki, S. (1984) Dev. Biol. 103, 211-220). The deduced amino acid sequence from the cDNA analysis indicates the presence of consensus leucine-rich repeats which are present in other small proteoglycans, decorin, biglycan, and fibromodulin. However, the homology analysis revealed that chick PG-Lb showed a higher homology (about 50% in the region containing leucine-rich repeats) to human osteoinductive factor, OIF, rather than to the other small proteoglycans. Furthermore, 6 cysteine residues are detected in both PG-Lb and OIF with invariant relative positions. Therefore, such an evolutionarily conserved structure in the PG-Lb core protein might be involved in some important biological functions of this molecule. In close relation to the structural similarity to OIF, the unique expression of PG-Lb in the ossifying area of cartilage suggested the possible participation of this proteoglycan in osteogenic processes."
https://openalex.org/W1591454732,"The residues occupying the -3 and -1 positions relative to the cleavage site of secretory precursor proteins are usually amino acids with small, neutral side chains that are thought to constitute the recognition site for the processing enzyme, signal peptidase. No restrictions have been established for residues positioned +1 to the cleavage site, although there have been several indications that mutant precursor proteins with a proline at +1 cannot be processed by Escherichia coli signal peptidase I (also called leader peptidase). A maltose-binding protein (MBP) species with proline at +1, designated MBP27-P, was translocated efficiently but not processed when expressed in E. coli cells. Unexpectedly, induced expression of MBP27-P was found to have an adverse effect on the processing kinetics of five different nonlipoprotein precursors analyzed, but not precursor Lpp (the major outer membrane lipoprotein) processed by a different enzyme, signal peptidase II. Cell growth also was inhibited following induction of MBP27-P synthesis. Substitutions in the MBP27-P signal peptide that blocked MBP translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane and, hence, access to the processing enzyme or that altered the signal peptidase I recognition site at position -1 restored both normal growth and processing of other precursors. Since overproduction of signal peptidase I also restored normal growth and processing to cells expressing unaltered MBP27-P, it was concluded that precursor MBP27-P interferes with the activity of the processing enzyme, probably by competing as a noncleavable substrate for the enzyme's active site. Thus, although signal peptidase I, like many other proteases, is unable to cleave an X-Pro bond, a proline at +1 does not prevent the enzyme from recognizing the normal processing site. When the RBP signal peptide was substituted for the MBP signal peptide of MBP27-P, the resultant hybrid protein was processed somewhat inefficiently at an alternate cleavage site and elicited a much reduced effect on cell growth and signal peptidase I activity. Although the MBP signal peptide also has an alternate cleavage site, the different properties of the RBP and MBP signal peptides with regard to the substitution of proline at +1 may be related to their respective secondary structures in the processing site region."
https://openalex.org/W1568059379,"Extrinsic pathway inhibitor plays a key role in modulating tissue factor-dependent blood coagulation. We have studied binding of radioiodinated recombinant extrinsic pathway inhibitor (rEPI) to cultured cell surfaces. rEPI in the absence of added reactants bound to a limited extent to three cell lines studied. Binding of rEPI to two cell lines possessing surface tissue factor, but not to a cell line lacking surface tissue factor, was markedly increased in the presence of both factor VIIa and factor Xa, and calcium ions. Moreover, some increased tissue factor-dependent binding was also demonstrated with factor VIIa alone. Binding isotherms of rEPI to factor VIIa-tissue factor obtained with an ovarian carcinoma cell line were hyperbolic. Scatchard plots indicated the following: a Kd value of 4.5 +/- 1.5 nM and 335,000 +/- 84,000 sites/cell when factor Xa was present; a Kd value of 11.9 +/- 3.5 nM and 236,000 +/- 68,000 sites/cell when factor Xa was absent. In functional studies, high concentrations of rEPI, e.g. 27-67.5 nM, were found to inhibit factor VIIa-tissue factor-catalyzed release of activation peptide from tritiated factor IX in the absence of factor Xa. Whereas factor Xa was thus shown not to be required for rEPI to inhibit factor VIIa-tissue factor catalytic activity, its presence markedly enhanced rEPI's inhibitory function. Since the local concentration of extrinsic pathway inhibitor achieved at a site of tissue injury is unknown, the physiologic significance of the observation of extrinsic pathway inhibitor-induced inhibition of factor VIIa-tissue factor activity in the absence of factor Xa is not clear. However, factor Xa-independent inhibition could play a significant role when large doses of rEPI are administered in experimental studies of thrombosis."
https://openalex.org/W1601308358,"The mechanism of N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI)-induced release of Ca2+ from rat liver mitochondria was investigated. The addition of NAPQI or 3,5-Me2-NAPQI (a dimethylated analogue of NAPQI with only oxidizing properties) to mitochondria resulted in the rapid and extensive oxidation of NADH and NADPH. High-performance liquid chromatographic analysis of mitochondrial pyridine nucleotides revealed that the formation of NAD+ and NADP+ was followed by a time-dependent net loss of total pyridine nucleotides as a result of their hydrolysis, with the formation of nicotinamide. Preincubation of the mitochondria with cyclosporin A completely prevented the quinone imine-stimulated release of sequestered Ca2+ from mitochondria. Cyclosporin A did not affect the ability of NAPQI or 3,5-Me2-NAPQI to oxidize NAD(P)H but prevented the quinone imine-induced hydrolysis of the pyridine nucleotides. Although there was no detectable change in total protein-bound ADP-ribose content during quinone imine-induced Ca2+ release from mitochondria, meta-iodobenzylguanidine, a competitive inhibitor of protein mono(ADP-ribosylation), prevented Ca2+ release by NAPQI and 3,5-Me2-NAPQI; meta-iodobenzylguanidine did not inhibit the quinone imine-induced NAD(P)H oxidation and only partially blocked hydrolysis of the oxidized pyridine nucleotides. It is concluded that NAPQI causes the oxidation of mitochondrial NADH and NADPH, and stimulates Ca2+ release as a result of the further hydrolysis of the oxidized pyridine nucleotides and protein mono(ADP-ribosylation)."
https://openalex.org/W1548619243,"Aromatase, a cytochrome P-450, catalyzes the formation of aromatic C18 estrogenic steroids from C19 androgens. Using the x-ray structure of cytochrome P-450cam as the model, seven mutants of human aromatase were designed and expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells by a stable expression method. They are His-128→Gln, His-128→Ala, Cys-299→Ala, Glu-302→Leu, Asp-309→Asn, Asp-309→Ala, and Ser-312→Cys. The presence of the aromatase mutants in the transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells were confirmed by immunoprecipitation analysis. The kinetic parameters of these mutants using [1 beta,2 beta-3H] androstenedione (or [1 beta-3H]androstenedione), and [1 beta,2 beta-3H]testosterone as substrates were determined. In addition, inhibition profiles for these mutants with two aromatase inhibitors, 4-hydroxyandrostenedione and aminoglutethimide were obtained. Furthermore, the reactions catalyzed by these mutants were examined by evaluating the levels of the product estrone, and two intermediates, 19-hydroxyandrostenedione and 19-oxoandrostenedione by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography using [7-3H]androstenedione as the substrate. Our results indicate that among the positions we modified, Asp-309 appears to be very important for the enzyme catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1598718545,"Abstract The elongation factor 2 (EF-2) genes of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been cloned and characterized with the ultimate goal of gaining a better understanding of the mechanism and control of protein synthesis. Two genes (EFT1 and EFT2) were isolated by screening a bacteriophage lambda yeast genomic DNA library with an oligonucleotide probe complementary to the domain of EF-2 that contains diphthamide, the unique posttranslationally modified histidine that is specifically ADP-ribosylated by diphtheria toxin. Although EFT1 and EFT2 are located on separate chromosomes, the DNA sequences of the two genes differ at only four positions out of 2526 base pairs, and the predicted protein sequences are identical. Genetic deletion of each gene revealed that at least one functional copy of either EFT gene is required for cell viability. Messenger RNA levels of yeast EF-2 parallel cellular growth and peak in mid-log phase cultures. The EF-2 protein sequence is strikingly conserved through evolution. Yeast EF-2 is 66% identical to, and shares over 85% homology with, human EF-2. In addition, yeast and mammalian EF-2 share identical sequences at two critical functional sites: (i) the domain containing the histidine residue that is modified to diphthamide and (ii) the threonine residue that is specifically phosphorylated in vivo in mammalian cells by calmodulin-dependent protein kinase III, also known as EF-2 kinase. Furthermore, yeast EF-2 also contains the Glu-X-X-Arg-X-Ile-Thr-Ile effector sequence motif that is conserved among all known elongation factors, and its GTP-binding domain exhibits strong homology to the G-domain of Escherichia coli elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) and other G-protein family members. Based upon these observations, we have modeled the G-domain of the deduced EF-2 protein sequence to the solved crystallographic structure for EF-Tu."
https://openalex.org/W1608816599,"A baculovirus expression system has been used to express large quantities of the lymphocyte-specific protein-tyrosyl kinase p56lck. A series of chromatographic steps, including the novel application of metalchelate affinity chromatography for protein kinase purification, were employed to obtain p56lck in a highly active form. Recombinant p56lck was purified to apparent homogeneity as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analyses and was found to migrate in SDS gels as two related species, both with apparent molecular masses close to 56 kDa. p56lck phosphorylated all assayed substrates exclusively on tyrosyl residues, and underwent autophosphorylation at one principal site, also on a tyrosyl residue. p56lck displayed a high affinity for a synthetic peptide corresponding to the cytoplasmic domain (residues 52-164) of the T-cell receptor zeta-chain (TCR-zeta) (Km approximately 6.5 microM) but a low affinity for a peptide corresponding to its own autophosphorylation site (Km approximately 900 microM). p56lck was also found to be highly active for a purified protein-tyrosyl kinase (Vmax greater than 400 pmol.min-1.micrograms-1 using the TCR-zeta (52-164) as a substrate). A variety of agents were tested for their ability to inhibit p56lck, with zinc ions (I50 approximately 1.7 mM) and staurosporine (I50 approximately 500 nM) proving the most potent."
https://openalex.org/W1546382247,"The interactions of azidothymidine triphosphate, the metabolically active form of the anti-AIDS drug azidothymidine (zidovudine), with the cellular DNA polymerases alpha, delta, and epsilon, as well as with the RNA primer-forming enzyme DNA primase were studied in vitro. DNA polymerase alpha was shown to incorporate azidothymidine monophosphate into a growing polynucleotide chain. This occurred 2000-fold slower than the incorporation of natural dTTP. Despite the ability of polymerase alpha to use azidothymidine triphosphate as an alternate substrate, this compound was only marginally inhibitory to the enzyme (Ki greater than 1 mM). Furthermore, the DNA primase activity associated with DNA polymerase alpha was barely inhibited by azidothymidine triphosphate (Ki greater than 1 mM). Inhibition was more pronounced for DNA polymerases delta and epsilon. The type of inhibition was competitive with respect to dTTP, with Ki values of 250 and 320 microM, respectively. No incorporation of azidothymidine monophosphate was detectable with these two DNA polymerases because their associated 3'- to 5'-exonuclease activities degraded primer molecules prior to any measurable elongation. Template-primer systems with a preformed 3'-azidothymidine-containing primer terminus inhibited the three replicative polymerases rather potently. DNA polymerase alpha was inhibited with a Ki of 150 nM and polymerases delta and epsilon with Ki values of 25 and 20 nM, respectively. The type of inhibition was competitive with respect to the unmodified substrate poly(dA).oligo(dT) for all DNA polymerases tested. Performed 3'-azidothymidine-containing primers hybridized to poly(dA) were rather resistant to degradation by the 3'- to 5'-exonuclease of DNA polymerases epsilon and more susceptible to the analogous activity that copurified with DNA polymerase delta. It is proposed that the repair of 3'-azidothymidine-containing primers might become rate-limiting for the process of DNA replication in cells that have been treated with azidothymidine triphosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1497932001,"Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding proteins function in the coupling of a diverse span of cell surface receptors to a variety of intracellular signaling pathways, some of which stimulate cellular proliferation. With the recent discovery that mutated forms of G proteins are present in specific tumors, there has been an increased interest in the determination of the role of specific subtypes of G proteins in the regulation of cellular growth. We have attempted to determine which subtypes of G proteins are directly involved in serum-stimulated DNA synthesis through microinjection of inhibitory antibodies into living cells. Inhibitory rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against specific Gi alpha subunits were introduced into living Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts by microinjection, and the effect upon serum-stimulated DNA synthesis was examined. Results of these experiments indicate that Gi2 plays a direct role in serum-stimulated DNA synthesis in living cells and suggest that G proteins may function in a variety of mitogenic signaling pathways initiated by serum growth factors."
https://openalex.org/W1508676562,"The present studies examined the mechanisms responsible for the regulation of apolipoprotein (apo) E gene expression during human monocytic differentiation. Levels of apoE mRNA were low in undifferentiated THP1 cells, a human monocytic cell line. Addition of 12-O-tetradecanylphorbol-13-acetate (PMA) induced differentiation of these cells to a macrophage-like phenotype and was associated with increased apoE mRNA abundance in a time-dependent fashion, up to 10-11-fold within 32 h. Results of nuclear run-on transcription assays demonstrated that the apoE gene was transcriptionally active in undifferentiated THP1 cells and that differentiation of monocytes with PMA was associated with a maximal increase of apoE gene transcription rate of only 2-3-fold at 6-12 h. Using actinomycin D as an inhibitor of new transcription, we could demonstrate a more rapid degradation of mature apoE mRNA in undifferentiated compared to differentiated cells, suggesting that the apoE mRNA species was more stable in differentiated THP1 cells. Primer extension assays performed using RNA extracts from undifferentiated and differentiated THP1 cells confirmed the increase of apoE mRNA abundance in the latter but failed to disclose heterogeneity in apoE gene transcription start site between these two phenotypes. These findings indicate that apoE gene expression is controlled at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional loci during human monocyte-macrophage differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1490060007,"We have transfected the murine macrophage cell line, J774, which does not express its endogenous apoE gene, with a constitutively expressed human apoE cDNA in order to study post-transcriptional and post-translational control of apoE production in macrophages. Loading cells with cholesterol using preincubations in acetylated low density lipoprotein, previously shown to enhance macrophage apoE gene transcription and apoE synthesis, did not increase apoE synthesis or secretion in constitutively expressing transfected cells, suggesting that sterol control of macrophage apoE production occurs predominantly at a transcriptional locus. However, incubation in human high density lipoprotein (HDL3) stimulated apoE secretion and appeared to inhibit degradation of newly synthesized apoE. This effect could be entirely reproduced by incubation with phosphatidylcholine vesicles which increased apoE accumulation in the medium by 2-6-fold. Pulse-chase experiments indicated that the effect of HDL3 or phospholipid vesicles was very rapid (occurring within 15 min) and was independent of changes in apoE synthesis. Furthermore, the increased apoE which accumulated in the medium in the presence of phospholipid vesicles or HDL3 was not due to altered rates of reuptake of labeled apoE since this difference was completely preserved in the absence of extracellular calcium. These results indicate that alteration of sterol content does not regulate macrophage apoE production at a translational or post-translational locus but that incubation with HDL3 or phospholipid vesicles can enhance apoprotein E production independent of changes in apoE gene transcription or apoE synthesis. The nature of the signal generated by the phospholipid vesicles which leads to inhibition of intracellular apoE degradation and enhanced apoE secretion will require further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W3082283019,"In this paper, we show that the phi 29 DNA polymerase, in the absence of DNA, is able to catalyze the formation of a covalent complex between the phi 29 terminal protein (TP) and 5'-dAMP. Like the reaction in the presence of phi 29 DNA, TP.dAMP complex formation is strongly dependent on activating Mn2+ ions and on the efficient formation of a TP/DNA polymerase heterodimer. The nature of the TP-dAMP linkage was shown to be identical (a O-5'-deoxyadenylyl-L-serine bond) to that found covalently linking TP to the DNA of bacteriophage phi 29, indicating that this DNA-independent reaction actually mimics that occurring as the initiation step of phi 29 DNA replication. Furthermore, as in normal TP-primed initiation on the phi 29 DNA template, this novel reaction showed the same specificity for TP Ser232 as the OH donor and the involvement of the YCDTD amino acid motif, highly conserved in alpha-like DNA polymerases. However, unlike the reaction in the presence of phi 29 DNA, the DNA-independent deoxynucleotidylation of TP by the phi 29 DNA polymerase did not show dATP specificity, being possible to obtain any of the four TP.dNMP complexes with a similar yield. This lack of specificity together with the poor efficiency of this reaction at low deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) concentration reflect a weak, but similar stability of the four dNTPs at the phi 29 DNA polymerase dNTP-binding site. Thus, the presence of a director DNA would mainly contribute to stabilizing a complementary nucleotide, giving base specificity to the protein-primed initiation reaction. According to all these data, the novel DNA polymerase reaction described in this paper could be considered as a non-DNA-instructed protein-primed deoxynucleotidylation."
https://openalex.org/W1819829467,"Triiodothyronine (T3) induces the transcription of the human chorionic somatomammotropin (hCS) promoter transfected into rat pituitary (GC) cells, but does not stimulate the homologous human growth hormone (hGH) promoter. As demonstrated by forward and reverse mutagenesis, this differential T3 responsiveness is due to subtle structural differences in a T3 response element located between nucleotides -64 and -44 of the 5'-flanking DNA of the hGH and hCS promoters. Synthetic hCS(-70/-40) DNA binds thyroid hormone receptors with a 4-fold higher affinity than the corresponding hGH T3 response element, indicating that small differences in receptor binding properties are reflected by major differences in T3 responsiveness. Analysis of circular permutation fragments containing the native hGH and hCS or mutated hCS(-70/-40) sequences demonstrates that the thyroid hormone receptor induces DNA bending. The extent of bending shows a possible correlation with the function of these sequences, suggesting that the receptor-induced changes in DNA conformation may be required for thyroid hormone receptor action."
https://openalex.org/W1588715799,"The white-rot basidiomycete Phanerochaete chrysosporium is mostly known for its extracellular ligninolytic enzymes. In this paper, the purification and characterization of a novel extracellular protease secreted by this fungus in solid substrate cultures under ligninolytic conditions are described. The purification steps included extraction of enzymes from the wood substrate, concanavalin A-Sepharose chromatography, anion-exchange chromatography (Mono Q), and size-exclusion chromatography (Superose 12). The purified protein migrates with Mr = 40,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. It has an isoelectric point of 5.6 and a sharp pH optimum at 4.0. The protease is totally inhibited by Hg2+, p-hydroxymercuribenzoic acid, and N-bromosuccinimide, but is insensitive to phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin A, and EDTA. Its amino acid composition and NH2-terminal sequence have also been determined. The sequence data and the binding of the protease to concanavalin A indicate that the protease is a glycoprotein. The protease differs in its physicochemical properties and its response to inhibitors from other extracellular proteases previously found in another strain of P. chrysosporium. The data suggest that it has properties of both aspartate-type and thiol-type proteases."
https://openalex.org/W1652993674,"Rat hepatoma McA-RH7777 cell lines transfected with full-length human apolipoprotein (apo) B constructs produce mostly human apoB48 and only small amounts of apoB100, as a result of mRNA editing at codon 2153 (C to U conversion at nucleotide 6666). To abolish the formation of apoB48 and increase the yield of apoB100 and other forms of apoB longer than apoB48, site-specific mutations were introduced at or near the site of apoB mRNA editing. Among four mutations examined, only that in which codon 2153 was converted from CAA (Gln) to CTA (Leu) effectively precluded the formation of apoB48. In this mutant, a stop codon would not be generated even if the C to U conversion occurred. The three other mutations were introduced to disrupt the proposed stem-loop structure encompassing the editing site. Changes made in the third positions of five codons on the 5' side of the edited base or of four codons 3' of the edited base failed to eliminate the production of a protein with the approximate size of apoB48. A construct in which codon 2153 was changed from CAA to GAT (Asp) also failed to eliminate the production of a protein the size of apoB48. Analysis of the region between nucleotides 6200 and 6900 of the cDNA did not detect any prevalent alternate editing sites. Immunoblot analysis using polyclonal antibodies raised against synthetic peptides of human apoB100 indicated that the carboxyl terminus of the apoB48-like proteins probably resides between amino acid residues 2068 and 2129 of apoB100. These results provide some insight into the mechanism of apoB mRNA editing and will facilitate further studies on apoB-containing lipoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1515782092,"Acetogenic bacteria, as determined with Clostridium thermoaceticum, synthesize acetate by the acetyl-CoA pathway which involves the reduction of CO2 to a methyl group and then combination of the methyl with CoA and a carbonyl group formed from CO or CO2 (Wood, H.G., Ragsdale, S.W., and Pezacka, E. (1986) Trends Biochem. Sci. 11, 14-18). Carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH), the key enzyme in this pathway not only catalyzes the oxidation of CO to CO2 but also the final step, the synthesis of acetyl-CoA from a methyl group, CO, and CoA. Previously, it has been shown that ferredoxin can stimulate exchange of CO with CH3 14COSCoA (Ragsdale, S.W., and Wood, H.G. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 3970-3977). In the present study, it has been observed that ferredoxin and CODH can form an electrostatically stabilized complex. In order to identify the ferredoxin binding region on CODH, the ferredoxin and CODH were cross-linked by using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide. The cross-linked CODH-ferredoxin adduct was enzymatically as active as the uncross-linked complex. The native CODH and cross-linked CODH-ferredoxin complex were subjected to cyanogen bromide cleavage. By comparison of the high-performance liquid chromatography peptide profiles, it was observed that the mobility of at least one peptide is altered in the CODH-ferredoxin cross-linked complex. The peptide was identified with residues 229-239 of the alpha-subunit of CODH."
https://openalex.org/W1526510925,"Abstract The carbohydrate binding specificity of Psathyrella velutina lectin (PVL) was thoroughly investigated by analyzing the behavior of various complex-type oligosaccharides and human milk oligosaccharides on a PVL-Affi-Gel 10 column. Basically, the lectin interacts with the nonreducing terminal beta-N-acetylglucosamine residue, but does not show any affinity for the nonreducing terminal N-acetylgalactosamine or N-acetylneuraminic acid residue. Substitution of the terminal N-acetylglucosamine residues of oligosaccharides by galactose completely abolishes their affinity to the column. GlcNAc beta 1----3Gal beta 1----4sorbitol binds to the column, but GlcNAc beta 1----6Gal beta 1----4sorbitol is only retarded in the column. The behavior of degalactosylated N-linked oligosaccharides is quite interesting. Although all degalactosylated monoantennary sugar chain isomers are retarded in the column, those with the GlcNAc beta 1----2Man group interact more strongly with the column than those with the GlcNAc beta 1----4Man group or the GlcNAc beta 1----6Man group. The degalactosylated bi- and triantennary sugar chains bind to the column, but the tetraantennary ones are only retarded in the column. These results indicated that the binding affinity is not simply determined by the number of terminal N-acetylglucosamine residues. Addition of the bisecting N-acetylglucosamine residue reduces the affinity of oligosaccharides to the column, but addition of an alpha-fucosyl residue at the C-6 position of the proximal N-acetylglucosamine residue does not affect the behavior of oligosaccharides in the column. These results indicated that the binding specificity of PVL is quite different from those of other N-acetylglucosamine-binding lectins from higher plants, which interact preferentially with the GlcNAc beta 1----4 residue."
https://openalex.org/W1553632986,"Abstract Three isoforms of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) family, TGF-beta 1, TGF-beta 2, and TGF-beta 3, bind specifically and with high affinity to several cell surface components known as I, II, and III proteins. The I and II proteins may serve as biological receptors, whereas the III protein does not appear to be associated with TGF-beta-mediated cell responses, and its function remains unknown. Binding data on confluent monolayers of rat skeletal myoblasts of the L6 cell line reveals two novel patterns of TGF-beta 1 binding. Saturation of the I receptor with native TGF-beta 2 induces a 7-fold increase in binding of radiolabeled TGF-beta 1 at the II protein. No induction of II receptor binding was observed on subconfluent cells indicating a density-dependent phenomenon. The data suggest that the I and II proteins may interact during ligand binding in a manner which may be indicative of a regulatory role that is activated by the phase of cell growth or differentiation. A second observation is the binding of TGF-beta to a glycoprotein of 180 kDa and referred to here as the type VI binding protein. This protein is not related to previously described TGF-beta binding proteins, and its distribution appears universal among cell types. The level of TGF-beta 1 binding to this protein is dependent on the presence of TGF-beta 2. It is not known whether this protein transmits biological information or whether it serves as an accessory protein of a TGF-beta receptor complex."
https://openalex.org/W1569233552,"We have studied the mechanism for mobilization of retinol from stellate cells. Our data show that perisinusoidal stellate cells isolated from liver contained retinol-binding protein (RBP) mRNA. By Western blot analysis we found that cultivated liver stellate cells secreted RBP into the medium. Cultivated stellate cells loaded in vitro with [3H]retinyl ester mobilized radioactive retinol as a complex with RBP. Furthermore, exogenous RBP added to the medium of cultured stellate cells increased the secretion of retinol to the medium. These data suggest that liver stellate cells in vivo mobilize retinol directly to the blood and that a transfer to parenchymal cells for secretion as holo-RBP is not required. The direct mobilization of retinol from liver stellate cells as retinol-RBP to blood is indirectly supported by the demonstration of RBP mRNA production and RBP secretion by lung stellate cells. The data suggest that the same mechanism for retinol mobilization may exist in hepatic and extrahepatic stellate cells. This is, vitamin A-storing stellate cells in liver, lungs, and probably also in other organs may synthesize their own RBP (or alternatively use exogenous RBP) and mobilize holo-RBP directly to the blood."
https://openalex.org/W1490333589,"smg GDP dissociation stimulator (GDS) is a stimulatory GDP/GTP exchange protein for a group of ras p21-like small GTP-binding proteins (G proteins) including c-Ki-ras p21, smg p21A, smg p21B, and rhoA p21. smg GDS converts the GDP-bound inactive form to the GTP-bound active form of each small G protein by stimulating their GDP/GTP exchange reaction in a cell-free system. The point-mutated c-Ki-ras p21 (c-Ki-rasval12 p21) is known to strongly transform NIH/3T3 cells and to markedly stimulate the c-fos promoter/enhancer in this cell line, whereas the normal c-Ki-ras p21 is weak in these activities. In the present study, we examined the effect of smg GDS on these activities to explore its physiological function. Overexpression of both smg GDS and c-Ki-ras p21 strongly transformed NIH/3T3 cells, whereas overexpression of either smg GDS or c-Ki-ras p21 alone weakly transformed the cells. Furthermore, overexpression of both smg GDS and c-Ki-ras p21 markedly stimulated the c-fos promoter/enhancer in NIH/3T3 cells, whereas overexpression of either smg GDS or c-Ki-ras p21 alone weakly stimulated it. These results indicate that smg GDS transforms NIH/3T3 cells and stimulates the c-fos promoter/enhancer in this cell line in cooperation with c-Ki-ras p21."
https://openalex.org/W1516006883,"A metallothiol protease called insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) seems to be implicated in insulin metabolism to terminate the response of cells to hormone, as well as in other biological functions, including muscle differentiation, regulation of growth factor levels, and antigen processing. In order to obtain highly pure and biologically active IDE, we have developed an immunoaffinity method using a monoclonal antibody to this enzyme (9B12). When the cytosolic fraction of rat liver was first applied to a 9B12-coupled Affi-Gel 10 column, more than 97% of the insulin-degrading activity was absorbed. Among various kinds of buffers successfully eluting the enzyme, only the buffer with a high pH (pH 11) could retain the full biological activity of this enzyme. IDE was further purified via two steps of chromatography using Mono Q anion exchange and Superose 12 molecular sieve columns. The final preparation showed a single band at 110 kDa on reduced sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). In the eluate from the immunoaffinity column, the inhibitory activity associated with the enzyme was also observed. To better recover this endogenous inhibitor, heat-treated cytosolic fraction was fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipitation and applied to the immunoaffinity column on which IDE had been adsorbed. Then, IDE and its inhibitor could be co-eluted with pH 11 as a complex form. After heat treatment of this fraction, the inhibitor was further purified using the same series of chromatography as IDE to more than 20,000-fold; it showed a 14 kDa band on SDS-PAGE. It inhibited both the insulin degradation by IDE in a competitive manner and the cross-linking of 125I-insulin to IDE. Highly purified IDE and the endogenous inhibitor will be useful tools for better understanding the various biological functions of this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1489057868,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins was examined in cells expressing wild-type (WT-EGFR) EGF receptors or EGF receptors truncated at residue 973 (973-EGFR). A much broader spectrum of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins was found following EGF treatment of 973-EGFR expressing cells compared with cells expressing wild-type receptors. Several additional ras GTPase activating protein-associated tyrosine phosphorylated proteins were found in EGF-treated 973-EGFR cells relative to WT-EGFR cells. Additional tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were also found to co-immunoprecipitate with phospholipase C gamma 1 (PLC gamma 1) following EGF treatment of cells expressing 973-EGFR relative to cells expressing WT-EGFR. EGF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC gamma 1 was found in cells expressing WT-EGFR, but not in cells expressing 973-EGFR. WT-EGF receptor from EGF-treated cells bound well to bacterially expressed src homology (SH) regions of PLC gamma 1 and to a lesser extent to bacterially expressed GTPase activating protein SH regions. No binding of 973-EGF receptor to SH regions of either protein could be detected. EGF treatment greatly reduced the half-life of WT-EGFR, but had relatively little effect on the half-life of 973-EGFR. EGF induced internalization of 973-EGFR at a slower rate than WT-EGFR and caused the appearance of discrete receptor degradation products for both cell types. The data indicate that truncation of the EGF receptor at residue 973 alters receptor substrate specificity, decreases the rate of receptor internalization, and has an inhibitory effect on receptor degradation."

We cloned a human pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase cDNA by complementation of proline auxotrophy in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant strain, DT1100. Using a HepG2 cDNA library in a yeast expression vector, we screened 10(5) transformants, two of which gained proline prototrophy. The plasmids in both contained similar 1.8-kilobase inserts, which when reintroduced into strain DT1100, conferred proline prototrophy. The pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase activity in these prototrophs was 1-3% that of wild type yeast, in contrast to the activity in strain DT1100 which was undetectable. The 1810-base pair pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase cDNA hybridizes to a 1.85-kilobase mRNA in samples from human cell lines and predicts a 319-amino acid, 33.4-kDa protein. The derived amino acid sequence is 32% identical with that of S. cerevisiae. By genomic DNA hybridization analysis, the human reductase appears to be encoded by a single copy gene which maps to chromosome 17."
https://openalex.org/W1631443131,"Previously, we reported a rat S1 protein that is antigenically related to statin, a nonproliferating cell-specific marker; however, it shares high homology with the known human elongation factor-1 alpha (EF-1 alpha). To differentiate S1 from rat EF-1 alpha and to study their respective regulation for expression, a rat EF-1 alpha cDNA clone was isolated and characterized. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of this partial rat EF-1 alpha cDNA are compared with that of human and mouse as well as with rat S1. Both their messages were detected in rat brain by EF-1 alpha- or S1-specific probes. However, the mRNA encoding EF-1 alpha is more abundant than that encoding S1. S1 and EF-1 alpha expression were investigated in the parotid and submandibular glands of untreated rats and those treated with isoproterenol, a proliferation-inducing catecholamine. Quantitative solution hybridization demonstrated a dramatic reduction (approximately 68 ) in the S1 mRNA following isoproterenol injection in proliferation-responsive parotid glands and a mild reduction (approximately 20 ) of S1 steady-state messages in the proliferation-refractile submandibular glands. A slight increase or no changes of EF-1 alpha levels in both parotid and submandibular glands following isoproterenol treatment are also observed. Therefore, the EF-1 alpha and S1 genes are different genes, both expressed and regulated in vivo, but in differential quantitative and qualitative patterns."
https://openalex.org/W1493286303,"The rate of ribosomal (r)-protein synthesis in the early Drosophila embryo is low despite the presence of abundant, maternally supplied r-protein mRNAs. This low rate is due to specific repression of r-protein mRNA translation. In contrast to r-protein mRNAs, most other mRNAs are efficiently translated in the early embryo. Here we report on the identification of cis-acting sequences that mediate translational repression of the r-protein A1 (rpA1) mRNA. Chimeric genes containing sequences from the translationally regulated rpA1 mRNA fused to the constitutively translated alpha-tubulin mRNA were constructed and transformed into the Drosophila germ line. Translation of the corresponding hybrid mRNAs was measured in ovaries and embryos of the transgenic flies. The results indicated that a 89-nucleotide sequence in the untranslated rpA1 mRNA leader is by itself sufficient to confer full translational regulation to a heterologous mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1530759517,"The nucleotide sequence of the Myxococcus xanthus orotidine-5'-monophosphate decarboxylase (OMP DCase) gene was determined. The derived protein sequence is not closely related to other prokaryotic OMP DCase sequences; nor is it closely related to any eukaryotic OMP DCase sequences. Progressive multiple alignment of the M. xanthus OMP DCase protein sequence with 19 other OMP DCase sequences revealed four conserved regions present in all 20 sequences. Ten entirely conserved residues were found in these four regions and one region contains a tight cluster of 5 conserved residues, certain of which may be catalytically active residues. A second open reading frame was found upstream of uraA and oriented in the same direction as uraA. A stretch of 21 consecutive pyrimidine (C or T) residues were found in the intercistronic region between the potential ribosome-binding site of uraA and the UGA stop codon of the upstream open reading frame. RNA directly upstream of the pyrimidine run, including the UGA stop codon of the upstream open reading frame, could be folded into a stable hairpin structure resembling Rho-independent terminators of Escherichia coli. Expression of the uraA gene may be regulated by an intercistronic transcription termination mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1516181317,"Abstract High resolution 2-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) combined with computerized analysis of gel images was used to search for proteins whose biosynthesis was induced or repressed in pancreatic islet cells chronically exposed to high glucose in an in situ and a tissue culture model of islet cell adaptation to excessive fuel load. The in situ model involved a 4-day intravenous infusion of either 50% glucose or 0.45% saline solution, followed by islet isolation, [35S]methionine labeling at 3 and 18 mM glucose for both groups, and protein analysis by 2-dimensional SDS-PAGE. The tissue culture model involved a 7-day culture of isolated rat islets in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal calf serum containing either 3 or 30 mM glucose, followed by radiolabeling and 2-dimensional PAGE of proteins as in the in situ model. A small fraction of about 1.5% of the approximately 2000 identifiable proteins can be characterized as adaptive proteins. Of these altogether 58 proteins in the two models, 5 proteins were demonstrable in both models and two of these (proteins 1526 and 7622) are particularly noteworthy. Protein 1526 (Mr 57,000; pI 5.09) showed the same response pattern in both models and its expression was most enhanced when islets from chronically glucose-infused animals or those cultured for 7 days at 30 mM were radiolabeled at 18 mM glucose. Protein 7622 (Mr 68,000; pI 6.50) (also known as GSP-65; Collins, H.W., Buettger, C., and Matschinsky, F.M. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The experimental strategy and the methodology are evaluated and the significance of the results is discussed. Potentials of the approach and plans for future experiments are considered."
https://openalex.org/W1549648697,"Abstract By deletion mutagenesis and transient expression in COS cells, a 96-amino acid hydrophilic sequence in the glycoprotein Ib alpha polypeptide located between L220 and L318 was identified which appeared to contain its von Willebrand factor- (vWF) binding site. The cDNA encoding this fragment was then expressed in Escherichia coli and purified from the bacterial cell lysate. The recombinant polypeptide, rGpIb alpha Q221-L318, was monomeric and had an apparent molecular weight of 14,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. It inhibited both ristocetin-induced binding of 125I-vWF to fixed washed platelets and ristocetin-induced platelet agglutination. The recombinant polypeptide also inhibited the binding of 125I-vWF to immobilized type I and III collagen. Inhibition of 125I-vWF binding to platelets and collagen was dose-dependent, with IC50 values of 500 and 200 nM rGpIb alpha Q221-L318, respectively. Fifty % inhibition of ristocetin-induced platelet agglutination required 500 nM rGpIb alpha Q221-L318. Although rGpIb alpha Q221-L318 inhibited vWF binding to collagen it did not, itself, bind to collagen-coated surfaces. Reduction of the disulfide bond between C248 and C264 abolished activity. 125I-rGpIb alpha Q221-L318 bound directly to GpIb/IX sites on multimeric vWF. These studies document that a portion of the sequence between Q221 and L318 is needed for recognition and binding to vWF and that binding requires an intact disulfide bond between C248 and C264. The binding of this recombinant polypeptide to vWF multimers inhibits vWF interaction with two important substrates, platelet GpIb/IX and collagen."
https://openalex.org/W1502509218,"The ribosomal L12 protein gene of Sulfolobus solfataricus (SsoL12) has been subcloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. Five protein L12 mutants were designed: two NH2-terminal and two COOH-terminal truncated mutants and one mutant lacking the highly charged part of the COOH-terminal region. The mutant protein genes were overexpressed in E. coli and the products purified. The amino acid composition was verified and the NH2 terminally truncated mutants were subjected to Edman degradation. The SsoL12 protein was selectively removed from entire S. solfataricus ribosomes by an ethanol wash. The remaining ribosomal core particles showed a substantial decrease in the in vitro translational activity. S. solfataricus L12 protein overexpressed in E. coli (SsoL12e) was incorporated into these ribosomal cores and restored their translational activity. Mutants lacking any part of the COOH-terminal region could be incorporated into these cores, as proven by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels of the reconstituted particles. Mutant SsoL12 MC2 (residue 1-70) was sufficient for dimerization and incorporation into ribosomes. In contrast to the COOH terminally truncated mutants, L12 proteins lacking the 12 highly conserved NH2-terminal residues or the entire NH2-terminal region (44 amino acids) are unable to bind to ribosomes, suggesting that the SsoL12 protein binds with its NH2-terminal portion to the ribosome. None of the mutants could significantly increase the translational activity of the core particles suggesting that every deleted part of the protein was needed directly or indirectly for translational activity. Our results suggest that the COOH terminally truncated mutants were bound to ribosomes but not functional for translation. Cores preincubated with these COOH terminally truncated mutants regained activity when a second incubation with the entire overexpressed SsoL12e protein followed. This finding suggests that archaebacterial L12 proteins are freely exchanged on the ribosome."
https://openalex.org/W1606650061,"Deoxygenation-dependent association of hemoglobin tetramers appears to be widespread among amphibians, reptiles, and possibly all or most birds. The evidence for this conclusion depends largely on oxygen equilibria of whole blood which have Hill coefficients that reach values as high as 5-7 at 80-90% oxygenation. Computer simulation of the sedimentation velocity behavior of the major components A and D of chicken hemoglobin shows that component D but not A self-associates to form dimers of tetramers. The gradient profiles at pH 7.5 were satisfactorily fitted with an association constant of 1.26 x 10(4) M-1 and sedimentation coefficients of 4.63 and 7.35 S for tetramer and (tetramer)2, respectively. Since components A and D share common beta chains we conclude that tetramer-tetramer contacts must depend on surface residues of the alpha chains. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of the alpha D and alpha A chains of the hemoglobins from 12 avian species ranging from sparrow to ostrich shows that 20 residues are conserved in the alpha D chains but not in the alpha A chains. Nine of these (45%) are clustered between positions E20 and FG2. Four of the latter, Lys71 (E20), Asn75 (EF4), Gln78 (EF7), and Glu82 (F3) are conserved in all alpha D chains even though they do not appear to participate in intratetramer contacts. Molecular modeling indicates that residues Lys71, Gln78, and Glu82 of the alpha chain are strong candidates for the primary tetramer-tetramer contacts."
https://openalex.org/W1608261530,"Upon binding insulin at the plasma membrane, the insulin receptor internalizes into the endosomal compartment of the cell with a half-time of approximately 10 min. Our earlier work demonstrated that receptor inactivation (loss of insulin binding capacity) is a regulated process. Long term treatment of cultured cells with insulin or the glucocorticoid dexamethasone increases or decreases, respectively, the rate constant for insulin receptor inactivation (Knutson, V. P., Ronnett, G. V., and Lane, M. D. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 79, 2822-2826). In these studies, monolayer cultures of 3T3-C2 fibroblasts were chronically treated with insulin or dexamethasone. Subsequently, the surface receptors were labeled with the photoactivatable cross-linking agent 125I-labeled 2-(p-azidosalicylamido)ethyl-1,3'- dithiopropionate -insulin. Following equilibration of the radiolabeled receptor between the plasma membrane and internal pools, the steady-state rate constant for receptor recycling was determined by quantitating the rate at which internal radiolabeled receptor was inserted into the plasma membrane. The steady-state rate constant for this recycling process was the same in control, insulin-treated, or steroid-treated cells (t1/2 = 2h). In contrast, the rate constant for receptor internalization was regulated; the half-times were 10 h for control cells, 5 h for insulin-treated cells, and 19 h for dexamethasone-treated cells. These changes in rate constants for internalization and inactivation lead to changes in the relative numbers of receptor molecules undergoing recycling versus inactivation. Therefore, whereas the recycling of the insulin receptor is not a regulated process, the internalization of surface receptor in the absence of bound ligand is a metabolically controlled step in receptor processing."
https://openalex.org/W1543384653,"Rats were given intraperitoneal injections of 2 mCi of carrier-free 32Pi and substances known to activate liver phenylalanine hydroxylase. After 30 min, these animals were anesthetized and their livers removed for analysis of enzyme activity, 32Pi incorporation into immunoprecipitated phenylalanine hydroxylase and [gamma-32P]ATP specific activity. Following glucagon treatment, rat liver phenylalanine hydroxylase activity was stimulated more than 6-fold when assayed in the presence of the natural cofactor, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). Glucagon injection also resulted in an incorporation of 0.41 mol of 32Pi/mol of hydroxylase subunit (approximately 50,000 Da). In vivo stimulation of phenylalanine hydroxylase activity and 32Pi incorporation by glucagon had been previously observed in this laboratory (Donlon, J., and Kaufman, S. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 6657-6659). However, we show for the first time in the present study that in vivo treatment with phenylalanine alone results in a 4-fold increase in the BH4-dependent activity of phenylalanine hydroxylase concomitant with a significant incorporation of phosphate into phenylalanine hydroxylase (0.51 mol of 32Pi/mol of hydroxylase subunit). It is further demonstrated in vivo that the combined treatment with phenylalanine and glucagon results in a greater than 10-fold stimulation of BH4-dependent activity and the greatest level of 32Pi incorporation (0.75 mol of 32Pi/mol of hydroxylase subunit). Phenylalanine did not produce an elevation in plasma glucagon in these animals. A model is, thereby, proposed with respect to the ligand binding effects of phenylalanine on the state of phosphorylation and activation of phenylalanine hydroxylase. The significance of these regulatory roles are considered in light of the probable physiological environment of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1561350282,"We previously reported that retinoic acid (RA) augmented mouse (BALB/c) lymphokine (interleukin-2)-activated killer (LAK) cell activity in a dose and time dependent manner. As evidence available has suggested the role of protein kinase C (PKC) in the regulation of cell mediated cytotoxicity, the present work was to investigate whether or not PKC may mediate the enhancement of LAK cell activity by RA. Accompanied with an augmented LAK cell activity, RA increased total PKC enzyme activity, [3H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate binding activity, and the amount of immunoreactive PKC. A prolonged treatment (18 h) of LAK cells with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate resulted in the loss of both PKC and LAK cell activity. PKC inhibitors, 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methyl-piperazine dihydrochloride and staurosporine, also drastically reduced LAK cell activity. Although most of the total PKC activity (97%) was detected in the cytosol fraction, the increase in PKC activity was attributed to an increased enzyme activity in both cytosol and membrane fractions, and shown to be RA dose-dependent. Kinetics study revealed that the increase in PKC was a time-dependent process and the enhancement was detectable as early as 8 h after the addition of RA to LAK cell culture. By immunoblotting, the cytosol PKC of LAK cells was shown to contain alpha and beta isoforms, but not gamma. RA further increased the expression of PKC alpha. The enhanced expression of alpha isozyme of PKC by RA was also in a dose and time dependent manner. Taken together, these results indicate that the mechanism of the augmentation of LAK cell activity by RA may in part result from the increase in PKC, especially PKC alpha isozyme."
https://openalex.org/W1586451091,"Substrate and inhibitor binding to dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) primarily involves residues in the amino-terminal half of the enzyme; however, antibody binding studies performed in this laboratory suggested that the loop region located in the carboxyl terminus of human DHFR (hDHFR; residues 140-186) is involved in conformational changes that occur upon ligand binding and affect enzyme function (Ratnam, M., Tan, X., Prendergast, N.J., Smith, P.L. & Freisheim, J.H. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 4800-4804). To investigate this observation further, site-directed mutagenesis was used to construct deletion mutants of hDHFR missing 1 (del-1), 2 (del-2), 4 (del-4), and 6 (del-6) residues from loops in the carboxyl terminus of the enzyme. The del-1 mutant enzyme has a two-amino acid substitution in addition to the one-amino acid deletion. Deletion of only one amino acid resulted in a 35 decrease in the specific activity of the enzyme. The del-6 mutant enzyme was inactive. Surprisingly, the del-4 mutant enzyme retained a specific activity almost 33 that of the wild type. The specific activity of the del-2 mutant enzyme was slightly higher (38 wild-type activity) than that of the del-4 mutant. All three active deletion mutants were much less stable than the wild-type enzyme, and all three showed at least a 10-fold increase in Km values for both substrates. The del-1 and del-2 mutants exhibited a similar increase in KD values for both substrate and cofactor. The three active deletion mutants lost activity at concentrations of activating agents such as KCl, urea, and p-hydroxymercuribenzoate that continued to stimulate the wild-type enzyme. Antibody binding studies revealed conformational differences between the wild-type and mutant enzymes both in the absence and presence of bound folate. Thus, although the loops near the carboxyl terminus are far removed from the active site, small deletions of this region significantly affect DHFR function, indicating that the loop structure in mammalian DHFR plays an important functional role in its conformation and catalysis."
