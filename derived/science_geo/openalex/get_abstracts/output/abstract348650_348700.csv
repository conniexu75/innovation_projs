https://openalex.org/W1426259424,"Methods for the determination of the total amount of fat in feces and of the relative proportions of free and combined fatty acids are described. They are based on the principle that fatty acids and fat can be extracted almost quantitatively with petroleum ether from an acidic, alcoholic solution of about 60 per cent ethanol, saturated with NaCl and containing a small amount of amyl alcohol. By these methods the fat in feces can be measured within 35 to 45 minutes with an error not exceeding 2 per cent."

https://openalex.org/W107773175,"Ochoaâ€™s earlier demonstration (2) that reaction (2) results in the formation of several high energy phosphate bonds, it was suggested that the stimulating effect of reaction (2) on reaction (1) might be by way of the creation of these phosphate bonds. The observation that cr-ketoglutarate showed the same stimulating effect on reaction (1) under anaerobic conditions came as a surprise. However, it was soon apparent that this stimulating effect could be reduced to the same basis as under aerobic conditions if one assumed that a-ketoglutarate was oxidized to succinate according to reac-"

https://openalex.org/W970200436,"In the course of investigations in intermediary carbohydrate metabolism, it was necessary to employ isotopic succinic acid. This material, labeled with Cl4 in the carboxyl position, was prepared via acetylenedicarboxylic acid according to the method described by Gilman and Haubein (1). In order to adapt the method to isotopic synthesis modifications were made, as described below, in the carbonation of the Grignard reagent. The reactions involved in the synthesis of the acetylenedicarboxylic acid, as postulated by Gilman and Haubein, are the following:"

This new element can be produced by the alpha particle transmutation of plutonium by the following reaction: {sub 94}Pu{sup 239} + {sub 2}He{sup 4} {yields} {sub 96}Cm{sup 242} + {sub 0}N{sup 1} This isotope of curium is radioactive and decays by the emission of an alpha particle to form plutonium 238 which, in turn, is also radioactive. Curium 242 has a half-life of 150 days, and its radioactive daughter, plutonium 238, has a half-life of 50 years. This isotope of plutonium decays by the emission of an alpha particle to form uranium 234 which has a half-life of 233,000 years. Shortly after the organization of the Atomic Energy Project, it became apparent that formidable problems would be presented as the result of the release of nuclear energy. One of the most urgent of these was the hazard presented by the production of large quantities of the radio-elements created by the fission of uranium and the coincidental formation of neptunium and plutonium. In an attempt to evaluate the potential danger presented by these radio-elements from the chain reacting pile, a large series of metabolic studies with experimental animals were undertaken in a number of laboratories working upon the Atomic Energy program. These studies, which have been briefly summarized elsewhere, included a series of investigations on the metabolism in the rat of the more important members of the fission products in the carrier-free state, as well as most of the heaviest elements at the end of the periodic table. These studies made it possible to predict on a semi-quantitative basis the potential hazards that this large number of radioactive elements might present should they gain entry into the body."

In pre-war days the feeding of these animals was less difficult (we used milk and eggs). Our aims were to discover : (1) whether an adequate supply of fresh food would delay hibernation ; and (2) to what degree temperature changes were related to or independent of relevant air temperatures."
