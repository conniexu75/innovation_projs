https://openalex.org/W2080665863,"Benthic foraminiferal faunas in a piston core from 3331 meters at 44 degrees N on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge show striking variations in the relative abundance of species. Uvigerina peregrina, which is broadly distributed today in the South Atlantic and in the Pacific in water that has been long isolated from the surface, is absent in the North and Equatorial Atlantic at depths occupied by highly oxygenated North Atlantic deep water. This species dominated the fauna at this site for much of the past 150,000 years. It is suggested that North Atlantic deepwater production was much reduced or eliminated at times of Uvigerina peregrina abundance, as a result of cooling and stratification of the Norwegian Sea surface, coincident with the times of the southward migration of the polar front in the North Atlantic."
https://openalex.org/W2000113534,"A perennial teosinte or ""wild maize"" endemic to the Cerro de San Miguel, Sierra de Manantlan, Jalisco, Mexico differs from Zea perennis by dimorphic rhizomes, robust habit, and a larger number of longer, laxer tassel branches. The fact that it is a diploid (2n = 20) has taxonomic and agronomic significance. The seeds are used locally for food."
https://openalex.org/W2088121143,Observations taken on an expedition into the Arctic Ocean north of Spitsbergen indicated the existence of a region of wind-driven upwelling along the edge of the ice pack. Models underestimate the 12-kilometer width of the upwelling region.
https://openalex.org/W2074698152,Artifactual and nonartifactual evidence from the lacustrine shores of the Chalco-Xochimilco Basin suggest the existence of fully sedentary human communities in the Basin of Mexico from at least the sixth millennium B.C.
https://openalex.org/W2034274127,Potassium enrichments in marine sediments have been reported which would imply a rate of diffusion of potassium into the oceans much larger than any of the know rates of addition or removal by other mechanisms. Experiments with mixtures of seawater and clay suggest that spurious enrichments can be produced if sediment samples are allowed to warm up before the pore water is expressed.
https://openalex.org/W2764955449,"An independent determination of density in the suboceanic lithosphere gives 3.5 to 3.6 grams per cubic centimeter at a depth of about 100 kilometers. This high value implies the existence of an ecologitic facies. A mechanism is proposed in which eclogite fractionation from the underlying, partially molten asthenosphere plays a key role in the creation and the spreading of the rigid, lithospheric plate."
https://openalex.org/W2036688027,"The structure of an unusual organometallic complex, {Th[(CH(3))(5)C(5)](2) H(micro-H)}(2) . C(6)H(5)CH(3), has been determined from neutron diffraction data, using only the direct-methods program MULTAN. Besides providing accurate metrical information on the first organometallic actinide hydride complex, these results have general and far-reaching implications concerning the complexity and size of crystal structures that can be elucidated solely on the basis of neutron diffraction data."
https://openalex.org/W2044293808,"Schreibersite, (Fe,Ni)(3)P, and a higher phosphide, barringerite, occur in the Ollague pallasite. The composition of the higher phosphide, determined by electron probe microanalysis, is (Fe(0.58)Ni(0.42)Co(0.003))(1.95)P. It is hexagonal, with space group P62m and a = 5.87 +/- 0.07 angstroms and c = 3.44 +/- 0.04 angstroms. If we assume a primary origin, the new mineral indicates that troilite and schreibersite crystallized at high temperatures. The occurrence of a higher phosphide in a pallasite indicates local nonequilibria within a group of meteorites that are remarkable for their overall degree of equilibrium crystallization."
https://openalex.org/W2053661081,"Although long-term forecasting is best left to science fiction writers, scientists can illumine basic technological trends, as in the 100-year scenario presented here. Computers will continue the ""small is beautiful"" trend, but they are not likely to follow the semilog trail because extrapolation from the current base would lead to absurdities such as a computer cost of 3/100 of a cent. To achieve inexpensive high speed and Lilliputian size, new techniques are likely to replace silicon technology. The ultimate computer might be biological and patterned on DNA. Future computers will reacquire information when needed rather than store it, and we will see personalized products at mass production prices. Light wave communication will broaden communications exchange, but software that is more friendly to human users will be needed. By taking over knowledge distribution, electronic information systems will let universities concentrate on new knowledge. More importantly, they will expand everyone's right to information and free expression through the existing media system and to protection from misuse of information by others."
https://openalex.org/W2015163435,"Fluoride ion concentrations are quickly and easily determined in seawater by means of a fluoride-selective electrode. Samples require little pretreatment; a determination takes 15 minutes; error limits are 5 percent; equipment required is rugged, inexpensive, and motion-insensitive; and minimum demands are made on the operator."
https://openalex.org/W2021102888,"One 50-tree site with monkeys and one without were similar with respect to tree height and tree diameter, but the site with monkeys had trees with significantly more branches than those on the site without monkeys. Possibly removal of terminal buds during feeding by the monkeys releases the lateral buds from apical dominance and allows increased branching."

https://openalex.org/W2061981369,"Pebbles that are initially weathered, inhomogeneous, angular, or fractured (""unsound"") become sound with transport. The Sternberg law describes well the wear of sound pebbles found in large rivers, but describes poorly that of unsound pebbles in river headwaters. For unsound pebbles the Sternberg coefficient (which is assumed to be a constant) decreases appreciably downstream. An alternative to the Sternberg law is derived in which the coefficient is proportional to the reciprocal of the downstream distance traveled. The laws are compared by using data from the Clutha basin in New Zealand."
https://openalex.org/W1999317532,"Velocities up to 34 centimeters per second have been recorded near the floors of submarine canyons off La Jolla, California. Currents move alternately down- and upcanyon with variable periods. All 3- to 6-day measurements show net current transport downcanyon. Many of the downcanyon currents of higher velocity correlate with ebbing tides, as measured at the nearby pier. Other factors producing the currents probably include internal waves. Velocities are sufficient to transport large quantities of fine sand."
https://openalex.org/W2059170274,"We measured the emission of water vapor at a wavelength of 1.35 centimeters from nine sources with the 120-foot (36.5-meter) Haystack antenna. Eight sources lie within 30 seconds of arc of the hydroxyl sources of 18 centimeters but not all hydroxyl sources produced detectable emission of water vapor. All sources are smaller than 30 seconds of arc in angular diameter, but we resolved at least three separate sources in the Orion Nebula. We do not find that the known hyperfine components are present with the equilibrium intensity distribution."

https://openalex.org/W2069632043,"The solar thermal energy stored in hydroelectric reservoir thermoclines is very large and greatly exceeds the gravitational hydroenergy of the surface water, even after limitations arising from the second law of thermodynamics have been taken into account. Greatly enhanced power production can be obtained at present hydroelectric facilities if heat engines are adapted to exploit this large thermal energy resource."
https://openalex.org/W2059751926,"Luminescence has been discovered in five apogonid fishes from the Philippine Islands. The luminescent organ systems, which are of two types, are morphologically different from the systems in the Japanese cardinal fish, Apogon ellioti, and in the apogonid genus Siphamia. Extracts of the organs all show a luciferin-luciferase type of reaction and cross-react with extracts of Apogon ellioti, Parapriacanthus ransonneti, and Cypridina hilgendorfii."
