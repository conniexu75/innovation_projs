Recently, a new radioactive series, not present in Nature, has been reported3,4. Seaborg has shown that U233, a member of this series, is fissile with neutrons. The following is a summary of the results of a survey of the longer-lived fission products of U233. The data were obtained in conjunction with those previously reported1, but could not be released for publication at that time."

https://openalex.org/W2078313775,"WE have recently submitted to the Chemical Society a paper describing, inter alia, a new synthesis of 5-hydroxyindole by reduction with iron powder and acetic acid of 2 : β -dinitro-5-acetoxystyrene and deacetylation of the resulting 5-acetoxyindole. As a part of a comprehensive investigation of the chemistry of the natural melanins, we have now successfully extended the method to the synthesis of 5 : 6-diacetoxyindole (compact hemispherical clusters, m.p. 135–136° ; found : C, 61·5 ; H, 4·9 ; N, 6·3 : C12H11O4N requires C, 61·8 ; H, 4·7 ; N, 6·0 per cent), and of 5 : 6-dihydroxyindole (colourless needles, m.p. 140° ; found: C, 64·7 ; H, 4·85 ; N, 9·4 : C8H7O2N requires C, 64·4 ; H, 4·7 ; N, 9·4 per cent). The latter compound was postulated by Raper1 as an unstable intermediate in the enzyme-catalysed oxidation of tyrosine to melanin, and has been known hitherto only in solution or in the form of its derivatives."

https://openalex.org/W1994720791,"IT was observed many years ago that the crystallization of amorphous selenium is promoted and accelerated by illumination1,2. I rediscovered this in the summer of 1941 and succeeded in producing true photographic images by means of this effect, using the initial product of selenium manufacture, namely, aluminium or steel disks covered with a film of selenium, as photosensitive plates. To do this, the mirror-like surface of the selenium must be polished with a soft material, such as tissue paper. The disk is then placed on a metal plate, preheated at 90–95° C, and an image, preferably a diapositive, projected on the surface of the selenium. During exposure, 'self-development' takes place and in 1–2 minutes a somewhat faint but in other respects perfect image will appear. The photographic process is then complete and the disk can be removed from the hot plate."

Odhner, of the Riksmuseet, Stockholm, has pointed out to me that Pellibranchus is a synonym of Okadaia Baba2. Okadaia contains small nudibranchs less than 5 mm. in length, limaciform, head and foot not carinate ; rhinophores simple, contractile, without sheaths ; mouth slit-like ; gills absent ; anus and nephroproct opening slightly to the right of the middorsal line, about a third of the way back from the head ; genital orifices obliquely in front of the anus on the right side of the body ; jaw plates absent ; radula formula, 3, 0, 3 ; liver divided into three or four lobes ; true heart not enclosed in a pericardium ; gonads consisting of two or three testes and five or six ovaries ; development is direct. These are the characters of the nudibranch described in my paper, and Pellibranchus is clearly a synonym of Okadaia which now contains Okadaia elegans Baba, 1930, the type from Japan, and Okadaia (= Pellibranchus) cinnabareus (Ralph, 1944) from New Zealand."

https://openalex.org/W4231265863,"A CONFERENCE at the City Boys' School, Leicester, convened and presided over by the headmaster, Mr. R. W. Crammer, was held on March 12 to discuss the problem of the difficulty experienced by science graduates in writing reports and the ways in which the grammar schools could help in overcoming it. Dr. U. R. Evans, reader in the science of metallic corrosion in the University of Cambridge, who had raised the matter in the university Senate House, addressed the conference in a private capacity. There were seventy people present, including the heads of grammar schools in the City and County of Leicester, their English and science masters and mistresses and representatives from Leicester University College, the Domestic Science College and the Women's Training College. The conference was welcomed not only because of the importance of its subject but also because it brought together representatives of the grammar schools and of institutions of higher education for the discussion of a common concern."
