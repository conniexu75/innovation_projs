https://openalex.org/W2068575894,"The functioning of the brain is affected by the molecular concentrations of many substances that are normally present in the brain. The optimum concentrations of these substances for a person may differ greatly from the concentrations provided by his normal diet and genetic machinery. Biochemical and genetic arguments support the idea that orthomolecular therapy, the provision for the individual person of the optimum concentrations of important normal constituents of the brain, may be the preferred treatment for many mentally ill patients. Mental symptoms of avitaminosis sometimes are observed long before any physical symptoms appear. It is likely that the brain is more sensitive to changes in concentration of vital substances than are other organs and tissues. Moreover, there is the possibility that for some persons the cerebrospinal concentration of a vital substance may be grossly low at the same time that the concentration in the blood and lymph is essentially normal. A physiological abnormality such as decreased permeability of the blood-brain barrier for the vital substance or increased rate of metabolism of the substance in the brain may lead to a cerebral deficiency and to a mental disease. Diseases of this sort may be called localized cerebral deficiency diseases. It is suggested that the genes responsible for abnormalities (deficiencies) in the concentration of vital substances in the brain may be responsible for increased penetrance of the postulated gene for schizophrenia, and that the so-called gene for schizophrenia may itself be a gene that leads to a localized cerebral deficiency in one or more vital substances."

The brains of newborn rats from females on the 8 percent protein diet contained significantly less DNA and protein compared to the progeny of the females on the 27 percent diet. The data on DNA indicate that there are fewer cells; the protein content per cell was also lower. If, at birth, the brain cells are predominantly neurons, and their number becomes final at that time, then such dietary restriction may result in some permanent brain-neuron deficiency. This quantitative alteration in number as well as the qualitative one (protein per cell) may constitute a basis for the frequently reported impaired behavior of the offspring from protein-deprived mothers."

No significant cell damage is seen in the absence of phytohemagglutinin, or when the lymphocytes are replaced by malignant lymphoid cells, thymus cells, or nonlymphoid cells. The lymphocytes remain viable during the reaction. Differences in histocompatibility between lymphocytes and erythrocytes are not required. Autologous lymphocytes are cytotoxic to the same extent as allogenic lymphocytes over a wide range of experimental conditions."

These changes are interpreted in terms of the configuration of the lipid hydrocarbon chains within the membrane. Effects of temperature, sonication, removal of lipids, and organic solvents on the amide I and II bands, associated with protein conformations, were also studied."

https://openalex.org/W2085557838,"When chick embryo fibroblasts are exposed to actinomycin D for 30 minutes to 3 hours, there is progressive inhibition of phospholipid synthesis, so that by 3 hours the inhibition is 40 percent. All phospholipids are affected. Since this inhibition is twice as great as the inhibition of protein synthesis, some effects of actinomycin D previously ascribed to decreased protein synthesis must be reevaluated."

https://openalex.org/W2138591345,"IN circulatory physiology, there may be difficulty in expressing quantitatively the response of a vascular bed in which blood flow has altered. If change of flow is used to express the response, then a large change in arterial pressure may be overlooked. For this reason it has been customary to express responses as changes of resistance, vascular resistance being the pressure difference across the vascular bed divided by the flow through it."

https://openalex.org/W2016516175,"Histochemical localization of an alkalinie phosphatase, with (alpha)-naphthyl phosphate used as substrate, shows that activity in breast muscle from normal chickens is restricted to the microvasculature. In chickens with hereditary muscular dystrophy, this enzyme activity disappears from capillaries and small arterioles before degeneraction of muscle fibers is detectable. This loss is retarded in myopathic chickens that have received oxygen therapy."

https://openalex.org/W2079617325,"A method has been developed for determining the yield of free ions formed by irradiation of a liquid with high-energy x-rays. Contrary to expectation, branched-chain paraffins produce many more free ions than straight-chain paraffins do, and the ether 1,4-dioxane produced only a third as many free ions as its hydrocarbon analog, cyclohexane."

The yield of the ion is independent of the carbinol concentration, and is thought to measure the yield of free ions generated in the solvent. The relative yields of ions thus found in cyclohexane and 2,2,4-trimethylpentane agree with measurements made by the clearing-field method."

https://openalex.org/W2073734927,"THE experiment described here indicates that mice arc able to discriminate between D2O and H2O. Two male litter mates of Mus musculus domesticus (strain T–O) were kept in separate Harwell type cages, each fitted with two water bottles. In the experimental cage, one bottle contained D2O and the other glass-distilled H2O, and in the control cage each bottle contained glass-distilled H2O. The bottles were refilled every 24 h and the quantity taken from each during the previous day was determined. The bottles were replaced in the cages in a random manner, following Fisher and Yates's table of random numbers. The experiment was continued for 14 days and Table 1 shows the quantities of liquid taken during that period by the two mice."

https://openalex.org/W2025532477,"Sodium ions (10-3 mole/liter) cause a marked increase in the ratio of phosphate esterified to oxygen utilized when turnip root mitochondria oxidize succinate. Separate study of the two phosphorylation sites associated with succinate oxidation indicates that the observed effect is a summation of differential responses of these sites to sodium ions. The activity of the first site, that associated with the reduction of cytochrome c, is stimulated about threefold by 10-3 molar NaCl, whereas phosphorylation at the second site, coupled with the oxidation of ferrocytochrome c, is slightly inhibited by the same concentration of NaCl"
