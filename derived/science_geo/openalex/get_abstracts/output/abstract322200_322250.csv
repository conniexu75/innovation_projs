https://openalex.org/W2051559013,"High-resolution studies of North Atlantic deep sea cores demonstrate that prominent increases in iceberg calving recurred at intervals of 2000 to 3000 years, much more frequently than the 7000- to 10,000-year pacing of massive ice discharges associated with Heinrich events. The calving cycles correlate with warm-cold oscillations, called Dansgaard-Oeschger events, in Greenland ice cores. Each cycle records synchronous discharges of ice from different sources, and the cycles are decoupled from sea-surface temperatures. These findings point to a mechanism operating within the atmosphere that caused rapid oscillations in air temperatures above Greenland and in calving from more than one ice sheet."
https://openalex.org/W2030837016,"Mapping the spatial arrangement of chemical functional groups and their interactions is of significant importance to problems ranging from lubrication and adhesion to recognition in biological systems. A force microscope has been used to measure the adhesive and friction forces between molecularly modified probe tips and organic monolayers terminating in a lithographically defined pattern of distinct functional groups. The adhesive interactions between simple CH(3)/CH(3), CH(3)/COOH, and COOH/COOH functional groups correlate directly with friction images of sample surfaces patterned with these groups. Thus, by monitoring the friction between a specifically functionalized tip and sample, one can produce friction images that display predictable contrast and correspond to the spatial distribution of functional groups on the sample surface. Applications of this chemically sensitive imaging technique are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2023138120,Polythiophene (Pth) was electrochemically deposited onto stainless steel substrate from freshly distilled boron fluoride-ethyl ether containing 10 millimoles of thiophene per liter. The free-standing Pth film obtained at an applied potential of 1.3 volts (versus Ag/AgCl) had a conductivity of 48.7 siemens per centimeter. Its tensile strength (1200 to 1300 kilograms per square centimeter) was greater than that of aluminium (1000 to 1100 kilograms per square centimeter). This Pth film behaves like a metal sheet and can be easily cut into various structures with a knife or a pair of scissors.
https://openalex.org/W2022170535,"In experiments on resonant tunneling through a ""quantum antidot"" (a potential hill) in the quantum Hall (QH) regime, periodic conductance peaks were observed as a function of both magnetic field and back gate voltage. A combination of the two periods constitutes a measurement of the charge of the tunneling particles and implies that charge deficiency on the antidot is quantized in units of the charge of quasi-particles of the surrounding QH condensate. The experimentally determined value of the electron charge e is 1.57 x 10(-19) coulomb = (0.98 +/- 0.03) e for the states v = 1 and v = 2 of the integer QH effect, and the quasi-particle charge is 5.20 x 10(-20) coulomb = (0.325 +/- 0.01)e for the state v = (1/3) of the fractional QH effect."
https://openalex.org/W2035962480,"Surface waters along a cruise track in the East Pacific Ocean were undersaturated in methyl bromide (CH(3)Br) in most areas except for coastal and upwelling regions, with saturation anomalies ranging from + 100 percent in coastal waters to -50 percent in open ocean areas, representing a regionally weighted mean of -16 (-13 to -20) percent. The partial lifetime of atmospheric CH(3)Br with respect to calculated oceanic degradation along this cruise track is 3.0 (2.9 to 3.6) years. The global, mean dry mole fraction of CH3Br in the atmosphere was 9.8 +/- 0.6 parts per trillion, with an interhemispheric ratio of 1.31 +/- 0.08. These data indicate that approximately 8 percent (0.2 parts per trillion) of the observed interhemispheric difference in atmospheric CH3Br could be attributed to an uneven global distribution of oceanic sources and sinks."

Thin-film compounds were formed when the constraint of epitaxy was used to stabilize SrCuO(2)-BaCuO(2) superlattices in the infinite layer structure. Using this approach, two new structural families, Ba(2)Srn-1,Cun+1 O2n+2+delta and Ba(4)Srn-1 Cun+3O2n+6+delta have been synthesized; these families superconduct at temperatures as high as 70 kelvin."
https://openalex.org/W2016939527,The simultaneous time-resolved study of structure development and reaction kinetics during polymer processing is an experimental method that has great potential in developing a deeper understanding of the parameters that govern the formation of structure and therefore polymer properties. A combination of synchrotron radiation small-angle x-ray scattering and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy experiments have been performed on a series of model segmented block copolyurethanes. These studies confirm that the driving force for structure development in polyurethanes is the thermodynamics of phase separation rather than hydrogen bonding.
https://openalex.org/W2046639759,"Ion chromatography studies were performed to assess various models proposed for the structure of M(8)C(12) species, the met-cars. A laser desorption source was used to make a sequence of titanium-carbon clusters centered around Ti(8)C(12)(+). The Ti(8)C(12)(+) was determined to be a hollow cage cluster, with the dodechadron structure originally propposed termined to be a hollow cage cluster, with the dodecahedron structure originally proposed giving the best fit to experiment; cubic structures could be excluded. Collisional breakup of Ti(8)C(12)(+) yielded only Ti(7)C(12)(+) under the experimental conditions described herein, and modeling indicated that the cage structure was retained. Both Ti(8)C(11)(+) and Ti(8)C(13)(+) were made by the cluster source, and again, dodecahedral-type cage structures were consistent with experiment. The extra carbon atom in Ti(8)C(13)(+) was attached exohedrally to a single titanium atom. No evidence for an endohedral species was found."
https://openalex.org/W1998764984,"Although recent determinations of the distance to the Virgo cluster based on Cepheid variable stars represent an important step in pinning down the Hubble constant, after 65 years a definitive determination of the Hubble constant still eludes cosmologists. At present, most of the observational determinations place the Hubble constant between 40 and 90 kilometers per second per megaparsec (km s–1 Mpc–1). The case is made here for a Hubble constant that is even smaller than the lower bound of the accepted range on the basis of the great advantages, all theoretical in nature, of a Hubble constant of around 30 kilometers per second per megaparsec. Such a value for the Hubble cures all of the ills of the current theoretical orthodoxy, that is, a spatially flat universe composed predominantly of cold dark matter."

https://openalex.org/W2043459734,"The cancellation of the US Advanced Neutron Source will add to a growing shortage of prime facilities and increase Europe`s lead in the field. This article discusses the significance of this decision for neutron source technology both in the US and Europe, and the significance of this technology in the future. The demand for neutrons is growing rapidly. Europe, in spite of the number of powerful sources available, is pursuing a scattered course of development, with scientists divided about how to fill the neutron gap. In the meantime the US is back to the drawing board, both in terms of what to build and how and where to build it, though Oak Ridge National Laboratory is the preferred site."
https://openalex.org/W1973120106,"A classic 1976 study, CLIMAP, indicated that the tropical ocean cooled less than 2C during the worst of the last ice age while the rest of the world experienced a 5C chill. However, this climatic buffering in the tropics has come under attack with new evidence and possible errors in the original study. This article discusses new evidence about climate sensitivity in the tropics and reinterpertation in climate models."
