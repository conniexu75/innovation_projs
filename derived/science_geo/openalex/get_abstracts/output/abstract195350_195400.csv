An experimental method has been developed whereby it is possible to determine whet,her an amino donor undergoes transamination to a-ketoglutarate. 2. Besides alanine and aspartic acid, leucine, valine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, serine, glycine, and lysine are capable of entering such trans- amination. Histidine appears to be inert as an a-amino donor. Ammonia is not an intermediate in the amino group transfer. 3. Pyridoxamine labeled with N15 in the aminomethyl group has been synthesized. It transaminat’es readily with a-ketoglutarate in this sys- tem. The relationship of these findings to the mechanism of transamina- tion has been discussed. BIBLIOGRAPHY 1. Braunstein, A.

It has been suggested that filaments represent the initial form in which the infective phase of the virus is produced, spheres being formed secondarily2. Others have suggested that the filament is a by-product, as it were, of the process by which new infective particles are produced at the free surface of the allantoic cell3."

In the course of research into the underlying mechanisms responsible for this relationship, the effect of thyro-parathyroidectomy on the blood changes induced by injected cortisone, as indicated by modification of the leucocyte count2, has been studied."
