https://openalex.org/W2011131953,"The eukaryotic biological clock involves a negative transcription-translation feedback loop in which clock genes regulate their own transcription and that of output genes of metabolic significance. While around 10% of the liver transcriptome is rhythmic, only about a fifth is driven by de novo transcription, indicating mRNA processing is a major circadian component. Here, we report that inhibition of transmethylation reactions elongates the circadian period. RNA sequencing then reveals methylation inhibition causes widespread changes in the transcription of the RNA processing machinery, associated with m(6)A-RNA methylation. We identify m(6)A sites on many clock gene transcripts and show that specific inhibition of m(6)A methylation by silencing of the m(6)A methylase Mettl3 is sufficient to elicit circadian period elongation and RNA processing delay. Analysis of the circadian nucleocytoplasmic distribution of clock genes Per2 and Arntl then revealed an uncoupling between steady-state pre-mRNA and cytoplasmic mRNA rhythms when m(6)A methylation is inhibited."
https://openalex.org/W2029589437,"Several proteins at endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi membrane contact sites contain a PH domain that interacts with the Golgi phosphoinositide PI(4)P, a FFAT motif that interacts with the ER protein VAP-A, and a lipid transfer domain. This architecture suggests the ability to both tether organelles and transport lipids between them. We show that in oxysterol binding protein (OSBP) these two activities are coupled by a four-step cycle. Membrane tethering by the PH domain and the FFAT motif enables sterol transfer by the lipid transfer domain (ORD), followed by back transfer of PI(4)P by the ORD. Finally, PI(4)P is hydrolyzed in cis by the ER protein Sac1. The energy provided by PI(4)P hydrolysis drives sterol transfer and allows negative feedback when PI(4)P becomes limiting. Other lipid transfer proteins are tethered by the same mechanism. Thus, OSBP-mediated back transfer of PI(4)P might coordinate the transfer of other lipid species at the ER-Golgi interface."
https://openalex.org/W2005641666,"Mitochondrial calcium has been postulated to regulate a wide range of processes from bioenergetics to cell death. Here, we characterize a mouse model that lacks expression of the recently discovered mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU). Mitochondria derived from MCU−/− mice have no apparent capacity to rapidly uptake calcium. Whereas basal metabolism seems unaffected, the skeletal muscle of MCU−/− mice exhibited alterations in the phosphorylation and activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase. In addition, MCU−/− mice exhibited marked impairment in their ability to perform strenuous work. We further show that mitochondria from MCU−/− mice lacked evidence for calcium-induced permeability transition pore (PTP) opening. The lack of PTP opening does not seem to protect MCU−/− cells and tissues from cell death, although MCU−/− hearts fail to respond to the PTP inhibitor cyclosporin A. Taken together, these results clarify how acute alterations in mitochondrial matrix calcium can regulate mammalian physiology. Until the recent discovery of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU), the effect of increases in mitochondrial calcium levels could not be tested in vivo. Finkel and colleagues have knocked out the gene coding for MCU in adult mice, and show that MCU is required for transport of calcium into the mitochondria. They also show that, in its absence, the function of skeletal muscle is altered; however, surprisingly, no effects are observed on the sensitivity to cell-death-inducing agents."

We present here a comprehensive genome-wide analysis of the prevalence, mutational spectrum, and functional consequences of microsatellite instability (MSI) in cancer genomes. We analyzed MSI in 277 colorectal and endometrial cancer genomes (including 57 microsatellite-unstable ones) using exome and whole-genome sequencing data. Recurrent MSI events in coding sequences showed tumor type specificity, elevated frameshift-to-inframe ratios, and lower transcript levels than wild-type alleles. Moreover, genome-wide analysis revealed differences in the distribution of MSI versus point mutations, including overrepresentation of MSI in euchromatic and intronic regions compared to heterochromatic and intergenic regions, respectively, and depletion of MSI at nucleosome-occupied sequences. Our results provide a panoramic view of MSI in cancer genomes, highlighting their tumor type specificity, impact on gene expression, and the role of chromatin organization."
https://openalex.org/W2152951302,"Regeneration capacity declines with age, but why juvenile organisms show enhanced tissue repair remains unexplained. Lin28a, a highly conserved RNA-binding protein expressed during embryogenesis, plays roles in development, pluripotency, and metabolism. To determine whether Lin28a might influence tissue repair in adults, we engineered the reactivation of Lin28a expression in several models of tissue injury. Lin28a reactivation improved hair regrowth by promoting anagen in hair follicles and accelerated regrowth of cartilage, bone, and mesenchyme after ear and digit injuries. Lin28a inhibits let-7 microRNA biogenesis; however, let-7 repression was necessary but insufficient to enhance repair. Lin28a bound to and enhanced the translation of mRNAs for several metabolic enzymes, thereby increasing glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). Lin28a-mediated enhancement of tissue repair was negated by OxPhos inhibition, whereas a pharmacologically induced increase in OxPhos enhanced repair. Thus, Lin28a enhances tissue repair in some adult tissues by reprogramming cellular bioenergetics. PAPERCLIP:"

In mice, endogenous RNAi is highly active in oocytes, but not in somatic cells, which we ascribe here to an oocyte-specific Dicer isoform (DicerO). DicerO lacks the N-terminal DExD helicase domain and has higher cleavage activity than the full-length Dicer in somatic cells (DicerS). Unlike DicerS, DicerO efficiently produces small RNAs from long double-stranded (dsRNA) substrates. Expression of the DicerO isoform is driven by an intronic MT-C retrotransposon promoter, deletion of which causes loss of DicerO and female sterility. Oocytes from females lacking the MT-C element show meiotic spindle defects and increased levels of endogenous small interfering RNA (endo-siRNA) targets, phenocopying the maternal Dicer null phenotype. The alternative Dicer isoform, whose phylogenetic origin demonstrates evolutionary plasticity of RNA-silencing pathways, is the main determinant of endogenous RNAi activity in the mouse female germline. In mammals, a single Dicer participates in biogenesis of small RNAs in microRNA (miRNA) and RNAi pathways.

A single mammalian gene encoding ribonuclease (RNase) III Dicer controls biogenesis of two small RNA classes involved in RNA silencing: microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). First expressed as long primary transcripts, miRNAs are processed into short hairpin precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) by the nuclear Microprocessor complex, which consists of RNase III Drosha and its cofactor DGCR8 (Jinek and Doudna, 2009Jinek M.

Filipowicz W. The widespread regulation of microRNA biogenesis, function and decay.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2010; 11: 597-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (3542) Google Scholar). Pre-miRNAs are cleaved by Dicer to produce mature miRNAs, which act as sequence-specific guides in effector complexes containing one of the four Argonaute (AGO) proteins and additional protein factors (Jinek and Doudna, 2009Jinek M. Doudna J.A. A three-dimensional view of the molecular machinery of RNA interference.Nature. 2009; 457: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar, Krol et al., 2010Krol J. Loedige I.

These effector complexes target cognate mRNAs to repress their translation. miRNA-mediated translational repression plays numerous essential roles in various somatic cell processes, such as differentiation and cell type specification (Bartel, 2009Bartel D.P. MicroRNAs: target recognition and regulatory functions.Cell. 2009; 136: 215-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15858) Google Scholar). However, maternal miRNAs are dispensable and miRNA activity is globally suppressed in mouse oocytes (Ma et al., 2010Ma J. Flemr M. Stein P. Berninger P. Malik R. Zavolan M. Svoboda P. Schultz R.M.

A different case represents endogenous siRNAs (endo-siRNAs) produced by Dicer from naturally occurring long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) substrates, which mediate sequence-specific endonucleolytic cleavage in RNAi pathway. Whereas the processing of dsRNA into siRNAs is inefficient and the level of endo-siRNAs is negligible in somatic cells (Calabrese et al., 2007Calabrese J.M. Seila A.C. Yeo G.W. Sharp P.A.

The highly active endo-siRNA pathway in mouse oocytes appears to play an essential biological role. A significant portion of oocyte endo-siRNAs arises from protein coding gene-pseudogene pairs and from convergent transcripts, suggesting that RNAi directly targets maternal mRNAs (Tam et al., 2008Tam O.H.

Oocyte-specific knockout of Dicer results in a severe phenotype characterized by chromosome misalignment and spindle defects during metaphase of the first meiotic cleavage, leading to meiotic arrest (Murchison et al., 2007Murchison E.P. Stein P. Xuan Z. Pan H. Zhang M.Q. Schultz R.M. Hannon G.J.

This phenotype is observed also in oocytes deficient in AGO2, which mediates endonucleolytic cleavage of mRNA during RNAi (Kaneda et al., 2009Kaneda M. Tang F. O’Carroll D. Lao K. Surani M.A. Essential role for Argonaute2 protein in mouse oogenesis.Epigenetics Chromatin. 2009; 2: 9Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In contrast, oocytes lacking Dgcr8 undergo normal meiotic maturation and fertilization and can support development to the term (Kaneda et al., 2009Kaneda M. Tang F. O’Carroll D. Lao K.

Lao K. Surani M.A. Maternal microRNAs are essential for mouse zygotic development.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 644-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). The highly active RNAi pathway in mouse oocytes has been in contrast with studies showing that mammalian Dicer is more efficient in processing miRNA precursors than perfect duplex RNA (Ma et al., 2008Ma E. MacRae I.J. Kirsch J.F. Doudna J.A. Autoinhibition of human dicer by its internal helicase domain.J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 380: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, Ma et al., 2012Ma E.

Here, we provide evidence that divergence of small RNA production in mouse oocytes and somatic cells arises from an N-terminally truncated isoform of Dicer that efficiently produces endo-siRNAs from long dsRNAs. This oocyte-specific isoform evolved as a consequence of a specific retrotransposon insertion, and it is essential for oocyte function. Our survey of the mouse maternal transcriptome high-throughput sequencing (HTS) (Smallwood et al., 2011Smallwood S.A. Tomizawa S. Krueger F. Ruf N. Carli N. Segonds-Pichon A. Sato S. Hata K. Andrews S.R. Kelsey G. Dynamic CpG island methylation landscape in oocytes and preimplantation embryos.Nat. Genet. 2011; 43: 811-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar) revealed an alternative exon (AltE) located within intron 6 of the Dicer gene (Figure 1A and Figure S1 available online). AltE is derived from an MT-C retroelement of the mammalian apparent long terminal repeat retrotransposon family. MT elements are expressed in oocytes and can serve as alternative promoters for adjacent genes (Peaston et al., 2004Peaston A.E. Evsikov A.V. Graber J.H. de Vries W.N. Holbrook A.E. Solter D. Knowles B.B. Retrotransposons regulate host genes in mouse oocytes and preimplantation embryos.Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 597-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). AltE serves as the first exon spliced at a conserved donor site (Peaston et al., 2004Peaston A.E. Evsikov A.V. Graber J.H. de Vries W.N. Holbrook A.E. Solter D. Knowles B.B.

Comparative genomic analysis suggests that the MT insertion giving rise to DicerO occurred relatively recently in the Muridae family. The MT insertion is found only in mouse and rat and is absent from genomes of other sequenced members of other rodent families (Figure 1C).Figure S1DicerO Genomic Organization, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Position of MT-C-derived alternative exon (AltE) in the Dicer gene.

In mice, DicerO transcript was detected only in oocytes (Figure 2A), where transcript levels increased during oocyte growth and rapidly declined after fertilization (Figure 2B). RT-PCR also indicated oocyte-specific expression of rat DicerO (Figure 2C). DicerO is the dominant Dicer protein isoform in mouse oocytes (Figures 2D and S2A). Consistent with HTS and RT-PCR data, the full-length somatic Dicer (DicerS) protein levels are minimal in mouse oocytes (Figures 2D and S2A). Ectopic expression of myc-tagged DicerO showed that the N-terminal truncation does not affect the characteristic cytoplasmic cellular localization of the protein (Figure S2B).Figure S2DicerO Expression and Activity, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Western blot analysis of NIH 3T3 cells (3T3, 20 μg of a protein lysate) and fully-grown GV oocytes (FGO, 600 oocytes = ∼15 μg of total protein).

Independent preparations of recombinant Dicer proteins were used for analyzing DicerO activity under single turnover conditions (500 and 250 nM Dicer with 30 nM substrate) and under excess of substrate (200 nM substrate and 80 nM Dicer). The architecture of DicerO resembles experimentally truncated human Dicer, which was shown to cleave a 37 bp dsRNA substrate more efficiently than full-length Dicer, suggesting an autoinhibitory function of the helicase domain in long dsRNA processing (Ma et al., 2008Ma E. MacRae I.J. Kirsch J.F. Doudna J.A. Autoinhibition of human dicer by its internal helicase domain.J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 380: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). To examine DicerO cleavage activity, we used a fluorescent in vitro dicing assay (Podolska et al., 2013Podolska K. Sedlak D. Bartunek P. Svoboda P. Fluorescence-Based High-Throughput Screening of Dicer Cleavage Activity.J. Biomol. Screen. 2013; (Published online August 14, 2013)https://doi.org/10.1177/1087057113497400Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), in which a perfect 27 bp RNA duplex substrate is cleaved to yield fluorescent product (Figure S2C). Consistent with previous results, DicerO was more active than DicerS (Figure 2E and S2D). To assess the biological significance of MT-driven DicerO expression in mouse oocytes, we used TAL effector nuclease (TALEN) technology (Miller et al., 2011Miller J.C. Tan S. Qiao G. Barlow K.A. Wang J. Xia D.F. Meng X. Paschon D.E. Leung E. Hinkley S.J. et al.A TALE nuclease architecture for efficient genome editing.Nat. Biotechnol. 2011; 29: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar) to produce mutant mice lacking the MT element in Dicer intron 6 (Figure 3A). Two TALEN pairs flanking the MT element were used to excise it from the genome (Figure S3), abolishing DicerO expression without affecting DicerS expression (Figure 3B). Mice homozygous for the deletion (ΔMT/ΔMT) were viable and males were fertile demonstrating that the deletion did not affect normal Dicer function in somatic cells or male germline. Females, however, phenocopied mice carrying oocyte-specific conditional deletion of Dicer (Murchison et al., 2007Murchison E.P. Stein P. Xuan Z. Pan H. Zhang M.Q. Schultz R.M. Hannon G.J.

Surani M.A. Maternal microRNAs are essential for mouse zygotic development.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 644-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar): they were sterile and their oocytes showed meiotic spindle defects and increased levels of endo-siRNA targets (Figures 3C–3E). Oocytes lacking DicerO also contained increased levels of MT retrotransposon transcripts (Figure 3E), similar to Dicer−/− oocytes (Murchison et al., 2007Murchison E.P. Stein P. Xuan Z. Pan H. Zhang M.Q. Schultz R.M. Hannon G.J. Critical roles for Dicer in the female germline.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 682-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, Watanabe et al., 2008Watanabe T. Totoki Y.

Nakano T. et al.Endogenous siRNAs from naturally formed dsRNAs regulate transcripts in mouse oocytes.Nature. 2008; 453: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). Thus, ΔMT/ΔMT mice provide genetic evidence that the MT-C insertion into Dicer intron 6 and the resulting MT-driven expression of DicerO are essential for the female germline. Remarkably, DicerO does not seem to be required for miRNA biogenesis in mouse oocytes, because levels of two abundant maternal miRNAs (miR-30 and Let-7) show a mild increase in ΔMT/ΔMT oocytes (Figure 3F).Figure S3TALEN-Mediated Deletion of the MT-C Element in Dicer Intron 6, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Positions of double-stranded breaks introduced by TALENs.

Given the limitations of the oocyte model system, we characterized DicerO in vivo in Dicer-expressing cell lines derived from embryonic stem cells (ESCs) lacking endogenous Dicer (Murchison et al., 2005Murchison E.P. Partridge J.F. Tam O.H. Cheloufi S. Hannon G.J. Characterization of Dicer-deficient murine embryonic stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

This approach allowed us to compare the ability of DicerO and DicerS to produce different classes of small RNAs from endogenous and ectopically expressed substrates. Three stable DicerO rescue lines expressing different levels of DicerO were selected for further study (Figure 4A). The DicerO-2 line highly overexpressed the protein, the DicerO-3 line expressed it at medium levels, and the DicerO-4 line expressed it at low levels. We also generated two lines expressing medium levels of DicerS (Figure 4A). As controls, we used a Dicer null ESC line (Dcr−/−), the parental ESC line heterozygous for Dicer (Dcr+/−; Murchison et al., 2005Murchison E.P. Partridge J.F. Tam O.H. Cheloufi S. Hannon G.J.

DicerO in all lines rescued miRNA expression (Figure 4B) and miRNA activity, as evidenced by suppression of five miRNA targets, including cell cycle regulators p21 and Rbl2 (Shenoy and Blelloch, 2009Shenoy A.

In addition, miRNAs in DicerO lines efficiently repressed luciferase reporters that carried binding sites either fully or partially complementary to the abundant, ESC-specific miR-294 (Houbaviy et al., 2003Houbaviy H.B.

To analyze endo-siRNA production by DicerO, we used HTS to identify small RNAs in ESC lines expressing DicerO or DicerS. Small RNA libraries from eight cell lines were sequenced to depths of 3–5 × 107 reads using sequencing by oligonucleotide ligation and detection (SOLiD) technology (GSE41207; Table S1). The size distribution of small RNAs in DicerO-expressing cells showed a peak at 21–23 nt reads, similar to results in DicerS and Dcr+/− ESC lines (Figure 5A). The majority of 21–23 nt reads in DicerO lines mapped to miRNAs, as did the majority in DicerS lines, although the proportion of 21–23 nt reads from non-miRNA loci was greater in DicerO lines than in DicerS lines (Figure 5B). The composition of the miRNA population in DicerO lines was generally similar to that in DicerS lines (Figure 5C); however, the abundance of several miRNAs was consistently different across the two types of cell lines (Figure S5). Accordingly, unsupervised clustering of miRNA transcriptomes from all samples led to separate clusters for DicerS and DicerO ESC lines, suggesting that each Dicer isoform"

A key challenge for epithelial tissues undergoing spreading is to increase their surface area without disrupting epithelial integrity. Here we show that orienting cell divisions by tension constitutes an efficient mechanism by which the Enveloping Cell Layer (EVL) releases anisotropic tension while undergoing spreading during zebrafish epiboly. The control of EVL cell-division orientation by tension involves cell elongation and requires myosin II activity to align the mitotic spindle with the main tension axis. We also found that in the absence of tension-oriented cell divisions and in the presence of increased tissue tension, EVL cells undergo ectopic fusions, suggesting that the reduction of tension anisotropy by oriented cell divisions is required to prevent EVL cells from fusing. We conclude that cell-division orientation by tension constitutes a key mechanism for limiting tension anisotropy and thus promoting tissue spreading during EVL epiboly."

This distinction is well captured by model-free and model-based reinforcement learning algorithms. Here, studying human subjects, we show it is possible to shift the balance of control between these systems by disruption of right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, such that participants manifest a dominance of the less optimal model-free control. In contrast, disruption of left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex impaired model-based performance only in those participants with low working memory capacity."
https://openalex.org/W1979249520,"Pervasive transcription of eukaryotic genomes stems to a large extent from bidirectional promoters that synthesize mRNA and divergent noncoding RNA (ncRNA). Here, we show that ncRNA transcription in the yeast S. cerevisiae is globally restricted by early termination that relies on the essential RNA-binding factor Nrd1. Depletion of Nrd1 from the nucleus results in 1,526 Nrd1-unterminated transcripts (NUTs) that originate from nucleosome-depleted regions (NDRs) and can deregulate mRNA synthesis by antisense repression and transcription interference. Transcriptome-wide Nrd1-binding maps reveal divergent NUTs at most promoters and antisense NUTs in most 3' regions of genes. Nrd1 and its partner Nab3 preferentially bind RNA motifs that are depleted in mRNAs and enriched in ncRNAs and some mRNAs whose synthesis is controlled by transcription attenuation. These results define a global mechanism for transcriptome surveillance that selectively terminates ncRNA synthesis to provide promoter directionality and to suppress antisense transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2090916626,"Autophagy is an essential cellular mechanism that degrades cytoplasmic proteins and organelles to recycle their components. Here we show that autophagy is required for reprogramming of somatic cells to form induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Our data indicate that mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is downregulated by Sox2 at an early stage of iPSC generation and that this transient downregulation of mTOR is required for reprogramming to take place. In the absence of Sox2, mTOR remains at a high level and inhibits autophagy. Mechanistically, Sox2 binds to a repressive region on the mTOR promoter and recruits the NuRD complex to mediate transcriptional repression. We also detected enhanced autophagy at the four- to eight-cell stage of embryonic development, and a similar Sox2 and mTOR-mediated regulatory pathway seems to operate in this context as well. Thus, our findings reveal Sox2-dependent temporal regulation of autophagy as a key step in cellular reprogramming processes."

Axon degeneration is characterized by elimination of axons or their branches, and results in loss of connectivity between neuronal cell bodies and their innervating targets. Axon degeneration has become increasingly appreciated as a critical feature of many neurological disorders including traumatic injury, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Burke and O’Malley, 2012Burke R.E.

Damage to axons often precedes the onset of symptoms and neuronal cell death, further supporting the clinical relevance of axon degeneration in the progression of those disorders. The functional preservation of axons is therefore thought to be an important therapeutic target for treatment of neurodegenerative disease. An extensively studied model of axonal death is Wallerian degeneration. Following physical damage to a nerve, axon segments distal to the lesion site undergo a stereotyped form of self-destruction (Waller, 1850Waller A. Experiments on the section of the glossopharyngeal and hypoglossal nerves of the frog, and observations of the alterations produced thereby in the structure of their primitive fibres.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1850; 140: 423-429Crossref Google Scholar) characterized by loss of the action potential, destruction of the cytoskeleton, membrane fragmentation, and demyelination (Coleman, 2005Coleman M. Axon degeneration mechanisms: commonality amid diversity.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 889-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, Coleman and Freeman, 2010Coleman M.P. Freeman M.R. Wallerian degeneration, wld(s), and nmnat.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2010; 33: 245-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). The discovery of the Wallerian Degeneration Slow (Wlds) mouse (Lunn et al., 1989Lunn E.R. Perry V.H. Brown M.C. Rosen H. Gordon S. Absence of Wallerian Degeneration does not Hinder Regeneration in Peripheral Nerve.Eur. J. Neurosci. 1989; 1: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar), and the subsequent characterization of the Wlds fusion protein, whose gain-of-function delays Wallerian degeneration of distal axon segments for an extended period (Mack et al., 2001Mack T.G. Reiner M. Beirowski B. Mi W. Emanuelli M. Wagner D. Thomson D. Gillingwater T. Court F. Conforti L. et al.Wallerian degeneration of injured axons and synapses is delayed by a Ube4b/Nmnat chimeric gene.Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 1199-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), demonstrated that the demise of injured axons is not triggered simply by loss of nutritive support from the neuronal cell body, but is instead regulated by an intrinsic mechanism in axons (Coleman, 2005Coleman M. Axon degeneration mechanisms: commonality amid diversity.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 889-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, Coleman and Freeman, 2010Coleman M.P. Freeman M.R. Wallerian degeneration, wld(s), and nmnat.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2010; 33: 245-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). In support of this notion, we and our colleagues have recently shown that loss-of-function of the endogenous gene Sarm1 also significantly delays Wallerian degeneration in mice, with a protective effect that is comparable to that observed in the Wlds mutant (Osterloh et al., 2012Osterloh J.M. Yang J. Rooney T.M. Fox A.N. Adalbert R. Powell E.H. Sheehan A.E. Avery M.A. Hackett R. Logan M.A. et al.dSarm/Sarm1 is required for activation of an injury-induced axon death pathway.Science. 2012; 337: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Despite these advances, the full molecular cascade underlying Wallerian degeneration remains to be elucidated. Axon degeneration is not unique to neurodegenerative disorders, but is also widely observed as a normal feature of the development of nervous systems (Luo and O’Leary, 2005Luo L. O’Leary D.D. Axon retraction and degeneration in development and disease.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 28: 127-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). The selective elimination of exuberant axons is crucial for the precise wiring of neural circuits. A classic example of axon degeneration in the developing nervous system is observed in the mammalian retinotectal system. During development, the axons of temporal retinal ganglion cells initially overshoot their future termination zone in the superior colliculus. Later, axon segments distal to the termination zone are stereotypically pruned through local degeneration (Feldheim and O’Leary, 2010Feldheim D.A. O’Leary D.D. Visual map development: bidirectional signaling, bifunctional guidance molecules, and competition.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2010; 2: a001768Crossref Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Studies in the past decade have revealed a variety of molecular signals responsible for eliciting axon pruning in different contexts, including activation of Semaphorin-Plexin or Eph-Ephrin signals. More recently, a critical role of the classic apoptotic pathway in developmental axon degeneration has begun to emerge. A signaling cascade involving the proapoptotic effector BAX and downstream caspases, including caspase-9, caspase-3, and caspase-6, is essential for axonal death in in vitro models of pruning triggered by trophic-factor deprivation, and contributes to axon degeneration in the developing retinotectal system (Nikolaev et al., 2009Nikolaev A.

Thus, whether divergent signaling pathways in pathological or developmental axon degeneration share particular regulatory step(s) remains unclear. Calpains are Ca2+-activated cysteine proteases implicated in a variety of physiological processes, whose aberrant activation can also result in proteolysis of vital cellular components (Goll et al., 2003Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. The calpain system.Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 731-801PubMed Google Scholar, Liu et al., 2004Liu X. Van Vleet T. Schnellmann R.G. The role of calpain in oncotic cell death.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2004; 44: 349-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In mammals, the most well-characterized members of the calpain family are calpain-1 (μ-calpain) and calpain-2 (m-calpain), which are ubiquitously expressed in tissues, including the peripheral and central nervous systems (Croall and DeMartino, 1991Croall D.E. DeMartino G.N. Calcium-activated neutral protease (calpain) system: structure, function, and regulation.Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 813-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar, Goll et al., 2003Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. The calpain system.Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 731-801PubMed Google Scholar). Calpain activity is critically controlled not only by intracellular Ca2+, but also by the endogenous proteinaceous inhibitor calpastatin (Croall and DeMartino, 1991Croall D.E. DeMartino G.N. Calcium-activated neutral protease (calpain) system: structure, function, and regulation.Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 813-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar, Goll et al., 2003Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. The calpain system.Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 731-801PubMed Google Scholar). Calpastatin binds and inhibits calpains via its calpain-inhibitor domains when the proteases are activated by Ca2+ (Hanna et al., 2008Hanna R.A. Campbell R.L. Davies P.L. Calcium-bound structure of calpain and its mechanism of inhibition by calpastatin.Nature. 2008; 456: 409-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Importantly, persistent activity of calpains can result in destruction of calpastatin, which has led to the notion that calpastatin is a “suicide inhibitor,” ensuring that calpains are kept in check in the case of transient fluctuations of intracellular Ca2+ and only reach their full proteolytic potential in the prolonged presence of the cation (Blomgren et al., 1999Blomgren K. Hallin U. Andersson A.L. Puka-Sundvall M. Bahr B.A. McRae A. Saido T.C. Kawashima S. Hagberg H. Calpastatin is up-regulated in response to hypoxia and is a suicide substrate to calpain after neonatal cerebral hypoxia-ischemia.J. Biol.

Fragmentation of an endogenous inhibitor upon complex formation with high- and low-Ca2+-requiring forms of calcium-activated neutral proteases.Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Therefore, the cellular content and distribution of calpastatin, as well as its balance with calpain activity, are key determinants of how efficiently Ca2+-activated calpains are inhibited (Goll et al., 2003Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. The calpain system.Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 731-801PubMed Google Scholar, Hanna et al., 2008Hanna R.A. Campbell R.L. Davies P.L. Calcium-bound structure of calpain and its mechanism of inhibition by calpastatin.Nature. 2008; 456: 409-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Previous studies have linked the overactivation of calpains to neurodegenerative disorders (Araújo and Carvalho, 2005Araújo I.M. Carvalho C.M.

Disord. 2005; 4: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, Camins et al., 2006Camins A. Verdaguer E. Folch J. Pallàs M.

The role of calpain in oncotic cell death.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2004; 44: 349-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Calpains have also long been implicated in axon degeneration triggered by physical injury in vitro (George et al., 1995George E.B. Glass J.D. Griffin J.W. Axotomy-induced axonal degeneration is mediated by calcium influx through ion-specific channels.J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6445-6452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and recently exogenous transgenic expression of calpastatin was used to provide definitive evidence for calpain involvement in sciatic and optic nerve degeneration after transection in vivo (Ma et al., 2013Ma M.

Endogeous calpastatin has been proposed to play prosurvival roles in adult neurons under degenerative conditions, including in models of ischemia-excitotoxicity (Bano et al., 2005Bano D. Young K.W.

However, whether endogenous calpastatin exerts any role in regulating survival specifically of axons in neurodegeneration models has not been determined. Moreover, involvement of calpastatin and calpains in other types of axon degeneration, e.g., in developmental pruning, remains unexplored. We report that calpastatin is depleted rapidly in the injured axons of cultured neurons as well as in transected nerves, concomitant with full-scale activation of calpains and axonal death. Axons with a reduction of endogenous calpastatin undergo accelerated Wallerian degeneration, whereas, consistent with recent results (Ma et al., 2013Ma M. Ferguson T.A. Schoch K.M. Li J. Qian Y. Shofer F.S. Saatman K.E. Neumar R.W. Calpains mediate axonal cytoskeleton disintegration during Wallerian degeneration.Neurobiol. Dis. 2013; 56: 34-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), maintaining the protein’s level protects injured axons both in neuronal cultures and in vivo. Interestingly, the calpastatin-calpain system is also involved in axon degeneration during development. Occurring downstream of the caspase cascade, depletion of calpastatin, followed by calpain activation, is required for the death of nerve growth factor (NGF)-deprived sensory axons in vitro. Furthermore, calpastatin critically regulates developmental pruning of retinal ganglion cell axons in vivo. These results provide evidence that calpastatin functions as an endogenous determinant of axonal survival both after injury and during development, and that distinct pathways of axon degeneration converge on this checkpoint prior to dismantling the axons. To study molecular mechanisms underlying axon degeneration, we optimized an approach allowing efficient enrichment of the axonal fraction for biochemical analysis, from either explant cultures or dissociated neuron cultures. With 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining, >99% of neuronal cell bodies could be reliably removed by this procedure (Figures 1A and 1B). To confirm separation of cell body contents from the axonal fraction, we compared the distribution of several cellular markers (Figure 1C). Cytoskeleton components (microtubules, neurofilaments, and actin filaments) were relatively evenly distributed among the cell body and axonal fractions, but the nuclear proteins lamin-A/C and histone H3 were effectively excluded from the axonal fraction. This approach therefore enabled us to focus on molecular events occurring specifically in axons during degeneration. As well, while the in vitro experiments in the current study are largely based on mouse embryonic dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons, this axon/neurite-enriching approach is also applicable to other neurons, including embryonic cortical neurons, embryonic motor neurons, and superior cervical ganglion neurons (data not shown), and thus represents a valuable tool for investigating axon degeneration in a variety of neuronal types. To explore critical regulators of axon degeneration, we first used a well-studied in vitro model of Wallerian degeneration (Figures 1D and 1E). Embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) to E13.5 DRG explants were cultured with NGF. Upon separation from their cell bodies, axons remained intact for the first 4 hr, although all their growth cones collapsed (data not shown; Sasaki and Milbrandt, 2010Sasaki Y. Milbrandt J. Axonal degeneration is blocked by nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (Nmnat) protein transduction into transected axons.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 41211-41215Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Signs of degeneration, including blebbing and fragmentation along axons, became evident around 6 hr postaxotomy, and the vast majority of axons degenerated at 8–10 hr postaxotomy (Figures 1D and 1E). We carried out biochemical analysis of axonal fractions prepared during this degenerative process to examine candidate proteins previously implicated in neuronal cell death. An abrupt decrease of the calpastatin level in axons was observed after axotomy at the 6 hr and later time points but not before (Figure 1F). Interestingly, this change of calpastatin level temporally correlated with the morphological degeneration of axons (Figure 1E), as well as the calpain-mediated degradation of neurofilaments, specifically neurofilament-M, neurofilament-L, and α-internexin/NF-66 (Figure 1F, and see below), consistent with a role for calpastatin in axon degeneration. Calpastatin appeared as doublet bands around 110 kDa, likely reflecting isoforms with different sites of transcription initiation (Goll et al., 2003Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. The calpain system.Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 731-801PubMed Google Scholar). Of note, levels of α-tubulin and β-tubulin protein monomers appeared unchanged during the degeneration of injured axons (Figure 1F; data not shown), providing a useful control for normalization of protein samples, even though polymerized axonal microtubules, visualized by TUJ1 immunostaining, were disassembled (Figures S1D and S2C available online; data not shown; Zhai et al., 2003Zhai Q. Wang J. Kim A. Liu Q. Watts R. Hoopfer E. Mitchison T. Luo L. He Z. Involvement of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in the early stages of wallerian degeneration.Neuron. 2003; 39: 217-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Moreover, the majority of the candidate proteins we examined also remained largely intact through the degenerative process, including proteins involved in the apoptotic pathway (BAX and caspase-3), Wallerian degeneration (DLK), trophic signaling (PI3K-p110α, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2), cytoskeletal dynamics (β-actin and Rac1/2/3) and metabolism (Hexokinase-I and GAPDH; Figure 1F). Thus, the degeneration of injured axons does not involve nonspecific degradation of axosolic proteins, and the degradation of calpastatin and other select proteins is a specific response to injury. Calpastatin functions as a “suicide inhibitor” for calpains to keep the proteases in check when they are transiently activated by intracellular calcium; however, when calcium levels increase persistently, calpains can eventually proteolyze calpastatin to overcome its inhibitory effect (Blomgren et al., 1999Blomgren K. Hallin U. Andersson A.L. Puka-Sundvall M. Bahr B.A. McRae A. Saido T.C. Kawashima S. Hagberg H. Calpastatin is up-regulated in response to hypoxia and is a suicide substrate to calpain after neonatal cerebral hypoxia-ischemia.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14046-14052Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, Nakamura et al., 1989Nakamura M. Inomata M. Imajoh S. Suzuki K. Kawashima S. Fragmentation of an endogenous inhibitor upon complex formation with high- and low-Ca2+-requiring forms of calcium-activated neutral proteases.Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Indeed, we observed in an in vitro biochemical assay that calpastatin was readily degraded by both calpain-1 and calpain-2 (Figure 1G). Because calpain activity has been implicated in axon degeneration triggered by physical injury in vitro (George et al., 1995George E.B. Glass J.D. Griffin J.W. Axotomy-induced axonal degeneration is mediated by calcium influx through ion-specific channels.J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6445-6452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the destruction of calpastatin that we observed could be due to activated calpains in axons. However, degradation of calpastatin has also been suggested to be mediated by the proteasome (Mellgren, 1997Mellgren R.L. Specificities of cell permeant peptidyl inhibitors for the proteinase activities of mu-calpain and the 20 S proteasome.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29899-29903Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To distinguish these possibilities, we inhibited the two types of proteases with small-molecule inhibitors. As a precaution, we compared three commonly used calpain inhibitors, ALLN, z-Val-Phe-CHO (calpain inhibitor-III), and MG-132, with two specific proteasome inhibitors, lactacystin and epoxomicin. ALLN, calpain inhibitor-III, and MG-132 showed comparable inhibitory activity toward calpain-1 and calpain-2, while lactacystin and epoxomicin had no effect (Figure S1A). However, treatment with ALLN, MG-132, lactacystin, or epoxomicin all resulted in the accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins in axons, reflecting their inhibition of proteasome activity (Figure S1B). Therefore, among the three common calpain inhibitors, calpain inhibitor-III appeared relatively specific to calpains, whereas ALLN and MG-132 inhibited both calpains and the proteasome. When axotomized axons were treated with calpain inhibitor-III, it preserved the protein level of calpastatin, as well as inhibiting proteolysis of neurofilaments (Figure 1H). The observation that calpain inhibitor-III did not completely inhibit calpastatin depletion might be explained by the high binding affinity (low nanomolar range) of calpastatin toward calpains (Goll et al., 2003Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. The calpain system.Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 731-801PubMed Google Scholar). The depletion of calpastatin after axotomy was also blocked in the presence of the Ca2+-chelator EGTA (Figure 1I). In contrast, proteasome inhibition by lactacystin or epoxomicin had no effect on the calpastatin level (Figure 1H). Together, these results suggested that calpastatin is degraded in injured axons by calpains. Previous studies have shown that the Wlds mutant protein can significantly delay the degeneration of injured axons in mice (Mack et al., 2001Mack T.G. Reiner M. Beirowski B. Mi W. Emanuelli M. Wagner D. Thomson D. Gillingwater T. Court F. Conforti L. et al.Wallerian degeneration of injured axons and synapses is delayed by a Ube4b/Nmnat chimeric gene.Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 1199-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). We compared the calpastatin level in axotomized axons overexpressing GFP (as a control) or a cytosolic version of Nmnat1(R125A/R127A; cyto-Nmnat1), which has been shown to be functionally equivalent to the protective Wlds fusion protein (Sasaki et al., 2009Sasaki Y. Vohra B.P. Baloh R.H. Milbrandt J. Transgenic mice expressing the Nmnat1 protein manifest robust delay in axonal degeneration in vivo.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 6526-6534Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). While calpastatin was rapidly degraded in control axons, depletion was completely blocked in the presence of cyto-Nmnat1 for at least 24 hr (Figure 1J), supporting the view that Wlds/Nmnat1 inhibits an upstream step leading to calpastatin depletion. In addition, we examined depletion of calpastatin in Sarm1−/− axons, which are also protected against Wallerian degeneration (Osterloh et al., 2012Osterloh J.M. Yang J. Rooney T.M. Fox A.N. Adalbert R. Powell E.H. Sheehan A.E. Avery M.A. Hackett R. Logan M.A. et al.dSarm/Sarm1 is required for activation of an injury-induced axon death pathway.Science. 2012; 337: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Compared to the axons of Sarm1+/− SCG neurons, the protein was significantly preserved in injured Sarm1−/− axons (Figure 1K), suggesting that calpastatin depletion occurs downstream of the Sarm1-dependent degeneration signal. Interestingly, we observed that the previously documented depletion of axonal Nmnat2 or SCG10 after axotomy (Gilley and Coleman, 2010Gilley J."

Considerable portions of eukaryotic genomes are transcribed. In addition to mRNAs, genomes encode long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that overlap with protein-coding genes in either sense or antisense orientation, or are derived from intergenic regions (Lee, 2012Lee J.T. Epigenetic regulation by long noncoding RNAs.Science. 2012; 338: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar, Ørom and Shiekhattar, 2011Ørom U.A. Shiekhattar R. Long non-coding RNAs and enhancers.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2011; 21: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In several cases, expression of lncRNAs is regulated and occurs under specific growth or developmental conditions. lncRNAs are emerging as critical components of epigenetic regulatory mechanisms that direct chromatin modifications (Batista and Chang, 2013Batista P.J.

However, the mechanisms by which cells recognize these RNAs and mediate their effects are poorly understood. Cellular RNA levels are tightly controlled at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. RNA-processing activities, such as the exosome and RNAi machinery, control the steady-state levels of diverse RNA species (Doma and Parker, 2007Doma M.K. Parker R.

Tollervey D. A transcriptome-wide atlas of RNP composition reveals diverse classes of mRNAs and lncRNAs.Cell. 2013; 154: 996-1009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The exosome processes and degrades RNA substrates in the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Houseley et al., 2006Houseley J. LaCava J. Tollervey D. RNA-quality control by the exosome.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). The nuclear exosome contains the 3′→ 5′ exonuclease Rrp6, which processes various RNAs to their mature forms and degrades ncRNA, antisense RNA, and transcripts produced from repeat elements (Houseley et al., 2006Houseley J. LaCava J. Tollervey D. RNA-quality control by the exosome.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, Reyes-Turcu and Grewal, 2012Reyes-Turcu F.E.

Dev. 2012; 22: 156-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Cofactors such as TRAMP (Trf4-Air2-Mtr4 polyadenylation), which polyadenylates RNA substrates through its noncanonical poly(A) polymerase Trf4/5 (Cid14 in fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe) and contains the RNA helicase Mtr4, stimulate exosome activity (Houseley et al., 2006Houseley J. LaCava J. Tollervey D. RNA-quality control by the exosome.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). In S. pombe, TRAMP also activates RNAi to degrade transcripts from repeat elements and antisense RNA (Zhang et al., 2011Zhang K. Fischer T. Porter R.L. Dhakshnamoorthy J. Zofall M. Zhou M. Veenstra T. Grewal S.I. Clr4/Suv39 and RNA quality control factors cooperate to trigger RNAi and suppress antisense RNA.Science. 2011; 331: 1624-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The regulated degradation of RNAs also impacts gene control during differentiation. Meiosis is the most dramatic differentiation program. In S. pombe, meiotic induction is accompanied by upregulation of meiosis-specific genes, which are silenced during vegetative growth (Mata et al., 2002Mata J. Lyne R. Burns G. Bähler J. The transcriptional program of meiosis and sporulation in fission yeast.Nat.

Sci. 2010; 86: 788-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Polyadenylation of meiotic RNAs facilitates their elimination and requires the canonical poly(A) polymerase Pla1, which acts together with Mmi1, a protein that binds RNA-containing determinant of selective removal (DSR) elements (Harigaya et al., 2006Harigaya Y.

Transcription and RNA processing promote assembly of heterochromatin, characterized by methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 and the presence of HP1 proteins (Reyes-Turcu and Grewal, 2012Reyes-Turcu F.E. Grewal S.I. Different means, same end-heterochromatin formation by RNAi and RNAi-independent RNA processing factors in fission yeast.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2012; 22: 156-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). S. pombe contains three distinct types of heterochromatin, which differ in their dependency on trans-acting factors. The first type corresponds to major H3K9me peaks at centromeres, telomeres, and the mating-type locus. RNAi proteins Argonaute (Ago1) and Dicer (Dcr1) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Rdp1) target transcripts produced by dg/dh repeats in these regions to generate siRNAs that facilitate loading of the Clr4/Suv39h methyltransferase (Reyes-Turcu and Grewal, 2012Reyes-Turcu F.E.

Dev. 2012; 22: 156-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The second type includes small blocks of heterochromatin islands, which include meiotic genes and other loci (Cam et al., 2005Cam H.P. Sugiyama T. Chen E.S. Chen X. FitzGerald P.C. Grewal S.I. Comprehensive analysis of heterochromatin- and RNAi-mediated epigenetic control of the fission yeast genome.Nat.

RNA elimination machinery targeting meiotic mRNAs promotes facultative heterochromatin formation.Science. 2012; 335: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Islands are akin to facultative heterochromatin and are dynamically regulated in response to environmental signals (Zofall et al., 2012Zofall M. Yamanaka S. Reyes-Turcu F.E. Zhang K. Rubin C. Grewal S.I. RNA elimination machinery targeting meiotic mRNAs promotes facultative heterochromatin formation.Science. 2012; 335: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The assembly of heterochromatin islands at meiotic genes requires Red1 and Rrp6, but not RNAi (Hiriart et al., 2012Hiriart E. Vavasseur A. Touat-Todeschini L. Yamashita A. Gilquin B. Lambert E.

RNA elimination machinery targeting meiotic mRNAs promotes facultative heterochromatin formation.Science. 2012; 335: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The third type of heterochromatin consists of domains called HOODs (heterochromatin domains), which are detected under specific growth conditions and are dynamically regulated (Yamanaka et al., 2013Yamanaka S. Mehta S. Reyes-Turcu F.E. Zhuang F. Fuchs R.T. Rong Y. Robb G.B. Grewal S.I. RNAi triggered by specialized machinery silences developmental genes and retrotransposons.Nature. 2013; 493: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). HOODs preferentially assemble at sexual differentiation genes and retrotransposons and require RNAi as well as elimination factors (Yamanaka et al., 2013Yamanaka S. Mehta S. Reyes-Turcu F.E. Zhuang F. Fuchs R.T. Rong Y. Robb G.B. Grewal S.I. RNAi triggered by specialized machinery silences developmental genes and retrotransposons.Nature. 2013; 493: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Red1 and its partners Pla1 and Pab2 are cofactors for both RNAi and the exosome, which act in parallel to degrade transcripts from loci within these domains (Yamanaka et al., 2013Yamanaka S. Mehta S. Reyes-Turcu F.E. Zhuang F. Fuchs R.T. Rong Y. Robb G.B. Grewal S.I. RNAi triggered by specialized machinery silences developmental genes and retrotransposons.Nature. 2013; 493: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which Red1 promotes assembly of RNAi-independent and -dependent heterochromatin and for the specification of HOOD formation are not understood. Here, we report that Red1 interacts with Mtl1 (Mtr4-like protein 1) to form a core module, MTREC (Mtl1-Red1 core), which associates with other factors to assemble islands or HOODs. We find that MTREC coordinates degradation of meiotic mRNAs and localizes to ncRNA loci that regulate gene expression in response to environmental changes. Mtl1 also associates with the putative C. elegans NRDE-2 (Guang et al., 2010Guang S. Bochner A.F. Burkhart K.B. Burton N. Pavelec D.M. Kennedy S. Small regulatory RNAs inhibit RNA polymerase II during the elongation phase of transcription.Nature. 2010; 465: 1097-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) homolog Nrl1 (NRDE-2 like 1), an evolutionarily conserved protein named Ctr1 (coiled-coil domain telomerase regulatory protein 1), and splicing factors. We also discover numerous previously unannotated and cryptic introns in the S. pombe genome. Splicing machinery and Nrl1 act on cryptic introns that specify assembly of HOODs, whereas Ctr1 facilitates processing of intron-containing telomerase RNA to maintain telomeres. These results uncover an RNA-processing network that targets various RNA substrates and promotes heterochromatin assembly. To investigate the role of Red1 in meiotic RNA processing and in RNAi-dependent and -independent heterochromatin formation, we expressed Red1 with 3 × FLAG-tag at its C terminus under its native promoter (Figure 1A). Purification of Red1-FLAG followed by mass spectrometry analysis identified a number of proteins specific to the Red1-FLAG purified fraction, including Red1 and its known interaction partners Mmi1 and Pla1 (Figure 1B) (Sugiyama and Sugioka-Sugiyama, 2011Sugiyama T. Sugioka-Sugiyama R. Red1 promotes the elimination of meiosis-specific mRNAs in vegetatively growing fission yeast.EMBO J. 2011; 30: 1027-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The purified fraction also contained components of the exosome (Figure S1A available online), consistent with the role of Red1 in facilitating RNA degradation by the exosome (Sugiyama and Sugioka-Sugiyama, 2011Sugiyama T.

We also identified new Red1-interacting partners (Figures 1B and S1A), including the uncharacterized proteins SPAC17H9.02 and SPAC7D4.14c as well as Rmn1, which contains an RNA recognition motif (Cho et al., 2012Cho Y.S.

SPAC17H9.02 shows significant homology to human hMtr4/SKIV2L2, which belongs to an RNA helicase family related to S. cerevisiae Ski2 (Lubas et al., 2011Lubas M. Christensen M.S. Kristiansen M.S.

The hMTR4 domains, including DEXDc, HELICc, KOW Mtr4, and DSHCT, are conserved in SPAC17H9.02 (Figure S1B). We named this novel protein Mtl1. Notably, Mtl1 is distinct from the previously described Mtr4 component of TRAMP (Bühler et al., 2007Bühler M. Haas W. Gygi S.P. Moazed D.

We named SPAC7D4.14c, a serine/proline rich protein with no apparent domains or homologs, Pir1 (protein interacting with Red1-1). Additional reproducibly detected proteins included the zf-C2H2-type zinc-finger protein SPBC725.08 (named Pir2, protein interacting with Red1-2), RNA polymerase I subunits (Rpa1 and Rpa2), Spt6 involved in chromatin and RNA processing (Kiely et al., 2011Kiely C.M. Marguerat S. Garcia J.F. Madhani H.D. Bähler J. Winston F. Spt6 is required for heterochromatic silencing in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2011; 31: 4193-4204Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and an assortment of proteins involved in RNA metabolism (Figure S1A). Purification and coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments also revealed association of Red1 with splicing factors (Figures S1A and S1C). To explore the interactions among Red1-associated proteins, we appended MYC or FLAG epitope tags to Mtl1, Pir1, and Rmn1 for immuno-affinity purification (Figure 1A). Mass spectrometry analyses of purified fractions revealed specific networks of interactions among Red1-associated proteins. Mtl1 purification yielded all of the major proteins identified in Red1 purifications, as well as additional proteins (Figures 1B and S1A). In particular, Rmn1 and proteins that specifically associated with Mtl1 did not purify with Pir1 (Figures 1B and S1A). Conversely, purification of Rmn1 yielded Red1, Mtl1, and Pab2, but not Pir1 (Figures 1B and S1A). We conclude that Red1 and Mtl1, which were detected in all four purifications, form the common core module of distinct protein assemblies. To confirm interactions among Red1-associated factors, we performed co-IPs (Figure 1C) and determined their subcellular localization by immunofluorescence (Figure 1D). We found that Pir1 and Rmn1 co-IP with Red1 (Figure 1C). However, Pir1 and Rmn1 did not copurify (Figures 1B and S1A), consistent with their affiliation with distinct Red1-containing modules. Our analyses also confirmed the Rmn1 and Pab2 interaction (Figure 1C). In addition to the previously established interaction between Pla1 and Red1 (Sugiyama and Sugioka-Sugiyama, 2011Sugiyama T. Sugioka-Sugiyama R. Red1 promotes the elimination of meiosis-specific mRNAs in vegetatively growing fission yeast.EMBO J. 2011; 30: 1027-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), we found that Pla1 and Mtl1 also co-IP (Figure 1E). Mtl1, Rmn1, and Pir1 localized to discrete foci in the nucleus (Figure 1D), similar to Red1 (Sugiyama and Sugioka-Sugiyama, 2011Sugiyama T. Sugioka-Sugiyama R. Red1 promotes the elimination of meiosis-specific mRNAs in vegetatively growing fission yeast.EMBO J. 2011; 30: 1027-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Mtl1 colocalized with Red1 (Figure S1D), and ChIP-chip analyses revealed shared binding sites across the genome (Figure S1E). Based on these results, we propose that a core comprising Red1 and Mtl1 (named MTREC) exists in multiple protein assemblies (Figure 1F). One assembly contains Pir1, and another is formed with Rmn1 and Pab2. A third includes Pla1, which is absent from Pir1 and Rmn1 purifications (Figures 1B and S1A). Mtl1 also engages in additional Red1-independent interactions (Figure 1F; see below). Red1 localizes to meiotic loci and facilitates formation of heterochromatin islands (Tashiro et al., 2013Tashiro S. Asano T. Kanoh J. Ishikawa F. Transcription-induced chromatin association of RNA surveillance factors mediates facultative heterochromatin formation in fission yeast.Genes Cells. 2013; 18: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, Zofall et al., 2012Zofall M.

RNA elimination machinery targeting meiotic mRNAs promotes facultative heterochromatin formation.Science. 2012; 335: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Because Mtl1 is similarly enriched at meiotic islands (Figures 2A and S2A), we examined whether loss of Mtl1 affects heterochromatin islands. Because Mtl1 is an essential protein (Kim et al., 2010Kim D.U. Hayles J. Kim D. Wood V. Park H.O. Won M. Yoo H.S. Duhig T. Nam M. Palmer G. et al.Analysis of a genome-wide set of gene deletions in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.Nat. Biotechnol. 2010; 28: 617-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar), we generated a partial loss-of-function mutant allele, mtl1-1 (Figure S1B). The mtl1-1 mutant showed severe defects in H3K9me at heterochromatin islands affected in red1Δ (Figures 2B and S2B). Both Red1 and Mtl1 were specifically enriched at islands that require these factors for H3K9me (Figures S2C and S2D), and Red1-dependent islands also showed strong correlation between levels of H3K9me and Mtl1 binding (correlation coefficient 0.90, p < 0.0001). Red1-independent heterochromatin islands that do not show Red1 and Mtl1 enrichment were not affected in mtl1-1 (Figures S2C–S2E). These results suggest that Mtl1 and Red1 act together as components of MTREC to assemble heterochromatin islands.Figure S2Red1- and Mtl1-Associated Factors Differentially Affect Heterochromatin Domains, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) ChIP analysis of Red1-MYC, Mtl1-MYC, and Pir1-MYC enrichment at the mei4 island.

We expanded our analyses to include factors associated with MTREC. Interestingly, loss of Pir1, but not Rmn1, led to defects in H3K9me at Red1-dependent heterochromatin islands (Figures 2B, S2B, and S2D). A low level of Pir1 enrichment was observed at heterochromatin islands, consistent with its direct involvement, and its loss affected silencing of target loci (Figure S2F). No major changes in H3K9me could be detected in cells carrying a mutation in Pla1, another MTREC-associated factor. Red1 also affects RNAi-dependent assembly of HOODs (Yamanaka et al., 2013Yamanaka S. Mehta S. Reyes-Turcu F.E. Zhuang F. Fuchs R.T. Rong Y. Robb G.B. Grewal S.I.

Knocking down PI5P4Kα and β in a breast cancer cell line bearing an amplification of the gene encoding PI5P4K β and deficient for p53 impaired growth on plastic and in xenografts. This growth phenotype was accompanied by enhanced levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to senescence. Mice with homozygous deletion of both TP53 and PIP4K2B were not viable, indicating a synthetic lethality for loss of these two genes. Importantly however, PIP4K2A(-/-), PIP4K2B(+/-), and TP53(-/-) mice were viable and had a dramatic reduction in tumor formation compared to TP53(-/-) littermates. These results indicate that inhibitors of PI5P4Ks could be effective in preventing or treating cancers with mutations in TP53."
https://openalex.org/W2060191947,"Developmental plasticity has been suggested to facilitate phenotypic diversity, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this relationship are little understood. We analyzed a feeding dimorphism in Pristionchus nematodes whereby one of two alternative adult mouth forms is executed after an irreversible developmental decision. By integrating developmental genetics with functional tests in phenotypically divergent populations and species, we identified a regulator of plasticity, eud-1, that acts in a developmental switch. eud-1 mutations eliminate one mouth form, whereas overexpression of eud-1 fixes it. EUD-1 is a sulfatase that acts dosage dependently, is necessary and sufficient to control the sexual dimorphism of feeding forms, and has a conserved function in Pristionchus evolution. It is epistatic to known signaling cascades and results from lineage-specific gene duplications. EUD-1 thus executes a developmental switch for morphological plasticity in the adult stage, showing that regulatory pathways can evolve by terminal addition of new genes."

Using a zebrafish embryo culture system with reporters of early and late skeletal muscle differentiation, we examined the influence of 2,400 chemicals on myogenesis and identified six that expanded muscle progenitors, including three GSK3β inhibitors, two calpain inhibitors, and one adenylyl cyclase activator, forskolin. Forskolin also enhanced proliferation of mouse satellite cells in culture and maintained their ability to engraft muscle in vivo. A combination of bFGF, forskolin, and the GSK3β inhibitor BIO induced skeletal muscle differentiation in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and produced engraftable myogenic progenitors that contributed to muscle repair in vivo. In summary, these studies reveal functionally conserved pathways regulating myogenesis across species and identify chemical compounds that expand mouse satellite cells and differentiate human iPSCs into engraftable muscle."
https://openalex.org/W2155416684,"Kinase suppressor of Ras 2 (KSR2) is an intracellular scaffolding protein involved in multiple signaling pathways. Targeted deletion of Ksr2 leads to obesity in mice, suggesting a role in energy homeostasis. We explored the role of KSR2 in humans by sequencing 2,101 individuals with severe early-onset obesity and 1,536 controls. We identified multiple rare variants in KSR2 that disrupt signaling through the Raf-MEKERK pathway and impair cellular fatty acid oxidation and glucose oxidation in transfected cells; effects that can be ameliorated by the commonly prescribed antidiabetic drug, metformin. Mutation carriers exhibit hyperphagia in childhood, low heart rate, reduced basal metabolic rate and severe insulin resistance. These data establish KSR2 as an important regulator of energy intake, energy expenditure, and substrate utilization in humans. Modulation of KSR2-mediated effects may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for obesity and type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2044857133,"Motor learning and functional recovery from brain damage involve changes in the strength of synaptic connections between neurons. Relevant in vivo evidence on the underlying cellular mechanisms remains limited and indirect. We found that the strength of neural connections between motor cortex and spinal cord in monkeys can be modified with an autonomous recurrent neural interface that delivers electrical stimuli in the spinal cord triggered by action potentials of corticospinal cells during free behavior. The activity-dependent stimulation modified the strength of the terminal connections of single corticomotoneuronal cells, consistent with a bidirectional spike-timing-dependent plasticity rule previously derived from in vitro experiments. For some cells, the changes lasted for days after the end of conditioning, but most effects eventually reverted to preconditioning levels. These results provide direct evidence of corticospinal synaptic plasticity in vivo at the level of single neurons induced by normal firing patterns during free behavior."

https://openalex.org/W2052633517,"Actin’s polymerization properties are markedly altered by oxidation of its conserved Met 44 residue. Mediating this effect is a specific oxidation–reduction (redox) enzyme, Mical, that works with Semaphorin repulsive guidance cues and selectively oxidizes Met 44. We now find that this actin-regulatory process is reversible. Employing a genetic approach, we identified a specific methionine sulfoxide reductase (MsrB) enzyme SelR that opposes Mical redox activity and Semaphorin–Plexin repulsion to direct multiple actin-dependent cellular behaviours in vivo. SelR specifically catalyses the reduction of the R isomer of methionine sulfoxide (methionine-R-sulfoxide) to methionine, and we found that SelR directly reduced Mical-oxidized actin, restoring its normal polymerization properties. These results indicate that Mical oxidizes actin stereospecifically to generate actin Met-44-R-sulfoxide (actinMet(R)O−44), and also implicate the interconversion of specific Met/Met(R)O residues as a precise means to modulate protein function. Our results therefore uncover a specific reversible redox actin regulatory system that controls cell and developmental biology. Terman and colleagues employed a genetic screen in Drosophila to identify the SelR methionine sulfoxide reductase as the enzyme responsible for reversing the Mical-mediated oxidation of actin. Thus, SelR antagonizes the effects of Semaphorin–Plexin–Mical-dependent signalling in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2051289873,"Nucleosome assembly following DNA replication and gene transcription is important to maintain genome stability and epigenetic information. Newly synthesized histones H3-H4 first bind histone chaperone Asf1 and are then transferred to other chaperones for nucleosome assembly. However, it is unknown how H3-H4 is transferred from the Asf1-H3-H4 complex to other chaperones because Asf1 binds H3-H4 with high affinity. Here, we show that yeast Rtt101(Mms1) E3 ubiquitin ligase preferentially binds and ubiquitylates new histone H3 acetylated at lysine 56. Inactivation of Rtt101 or mutating H3 lysine residues ubiquitylated by the Rtt101(Mms1) ligase impairs nucleosome assembly and promotes Asf1-H3 interactions. Similar phenotypes occur in human cells in which the ortholog of Rtt101(Mms1), Cul4A(DDB1), is depleted. These results indicate that the transfer of H3-H4 from the Asf1-H3-H4 complex to other histone chaperones is regulated by a conserved E3 ligase and provide evidence for crosstalk between histone acetylation and ubiquitylation in nucleosome assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2102568167,"Following a planktonic dispersal period of days to months, the larvae of benthic marine organisms must locate suitable seafloor habitat in which to settle and metamorphose. For animals that are sessile or sedentary as adults, settlement onto substrates that are adequate for survival and reproduction is particularly critical, yet represents a challenge since patchily distributed settlement sites may be difficult to find along a coast or within an estuary. Recent studies have demonstrated that the underwater soundscape, the distinct sounds that emanate from habitats and contain information about their biological and physical characteristics, may serve as broad-scale environmental cue for marine larvae to find satisfactory settlement sites. Here, we contrast the acoustic characteristics of oyster reef and off-reef soft bottoms, and investigate the effect of habitat-associated estuarine sound on the settlement patterns of an economically and ecologically important reef-building bivalve, the Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica). Subtidal oyster reefs in coastal North Carolina, USA show distinct acoustic signatures compared to adjacent off-reef soft bottom habitats, characterized by consistently higher levels of sound in the 1.5-20 kHz range. Manipulative laboratory playback experiments found increased settlement in larval oyster cultures exposed to oyster reef sound compared to unstructured soft bottom sound or no sound treatments. In field experiments, ambient reef sound produced higher levels of oyster settlement in larval cultures than did off-reef sound treatments. The results suggest that oyster larvae have the ability to respond to sounds indicative of optimal settlement sites, and this is the first evidence that habitat-related differences in estuarine sounds influence the settlement of a mollusk. Habitat-specific sound characteristics may represent an important settlement and habitat selection cue for estuarine invertebrates and could play a role in driving settlement and recruitment patterns in marine communities."

This effect of Reelin requires a modest but significant increase in presynaptic Ca2+ initiated via ApoER2 signaling. The specificity of Reelin action on spontaneous neurotransmitter release is encoded at the level of vesicular SNARE machinery as it requires VAMP7 and SNAP-25 but not synaptobrevin2, VAMP4, or vti1a. These results uncover a presynaptic regulatory pathway that utilizes the heterogeneity of synaptic vesicle-associated SNAREs and selectively augments action potential-independent neurotransmission."

https://openalex.org/W1965089340,"The mechanisms that regulate the establishment of adult stem cell pools during normal and perturbed mammalian development are still largely unknown. Here, we asked whether a maternal cytokine surge, which occurs during human maternal infections and has been implicated in cognitive disorders, might have long-lasting consequences for neural stem cell pools in adult progeny. We show that transient, maternally administered interleukin-6 (IL-6) resulted in an expanded adult forebrain neural precursor pool and perturbed olfactory neurogenesis in offspring months after fetal exposure. This increase is likely the long-term consequence of acute hyperactivation of an endogenous autocrine/paracrine IL-6-dependent self-renewal pathway that normally regulates the number of forebrain neural precursors. These studies therefore identify an IL-6-dependent neural stem cell self-renewal pathway in vivo, and support a model in which transiently increased maternal cytokines can act through this pathway in offspring to deregulate neural precursor biology from embryogenesis throughout life."
https://openalex.org/W2093049840,"Variability in gene expression contributes to phenotypic heterogeneity even in isogenic populations. Here, we used the stereotyped, Wnt signaling-dependent development of the Caenorhabditis elegans Q neuroblast to probe endogenous mechanisms that control gene expression variability. We found that the key Hox gene that orients Q neuroblast migration exhibits increased gene expression variability in mutants in which Wnt pathway activity has been perturbed. Distinct features of the gene expression distributions prompted us on a systematic search for regulatory interactions, revealing a network of interlocked positive and negative feedback loops. Interestingly, positive feedback appeared to cooperate with negative feedback to reduce variability while keeping the Hox gene expression at elevated levels. A minimal model correctly predicts the increased gene expression variability across mutants. Our results highlight the influence of gene network architecture on expression variability and implicate feedback regulation as an effective mechanism to ensure developmental robustness.PaperFlickeyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiI1ZjhlNDUyOWYzY2RhYmRkNTAyYWQ0NWY3Nzk0ZmUxZCIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc4MjY5NzcwfQ.T4wJO2qsn39alWFuh7Sp-GsEYO3nHFqGkq4V4f2W-TmXBdZ8hQITu_4pOyKIMzjygdEYXGEXVQBDeO2jlWwkY0EkoVqAbcNr1_2zJOlxvpDScUiwJUL3Jp6o0JtvuussQzr6YeRlB8chsR4ouiSb5EhExYi7CUaKum0ABNYSKlYSxzlyiqIuOKRMq5ejPFXUeGZMwOPA5sTHuJjB3L0eOU_3HRCm-NFxwcmWw-5oL3w2SS_cf-4iO607EGKBdjdWIpLCY9RdhOjhg_3G-CTa_lm4lWpyPPG9TdqVRb25ecwkQEIBoPvw6debGzM7D_himg4_cwP0c80-57RovE8CQA(mp4, (101.89 MB) Download video"
https://openalex.org/W2094918957,"Activated lymphocytes release nano-sized vesicles (exosomes) containing microRNAs that can be monitored in the bloodstream. We asked whether elicitation of immune responses is followed by release of lymphocyte-specific microRNAs. We found that, upon activation in vitro, human and mouse lymphocytes down-modulate intracellular miR-150 and accumulate it in exosomes. In vivo, miR-150 levels increased significantly in serum of humans immunized with flu vaccines and in mice immunized with ovalbumin, and this increase correlated with elevation of antibody titers. Immunization of immune-deficient mice, lacking MHCII, resulted neither in antibody production nor in elevation of circulating miR-150. This study provides proof of concept that serum microRNAs can be detected, with minimally invasive procedure, as biomarkers of vaccination and more in general of adaptive immune responses. Furthermore, the prompt reduction of intracellular level of miR-150, a key regulator of mRNAs critical for lymphocyte differentiation and functions, linked to its release in the external milieu suggests that the selective extracellular disposal of microRNAs can be a rapid way to regulate gene expression during lymphocyte activation."

We show that, for the first 5 min of copulation in Drosophila, stressful stimuli do not interrupt mating, whereas 10 min later, even minor perturbations are sufficient to terminate copulation. This decline in persistence occurs as the probability of successful mating increases and is promoted by approximately eight sexually dimorphic, GABAergic interneurons of the male abdominal ganglion. When these interneurons were silenced, persistence increased and males copulated far longer than required for successful mating. When these interneurons were stimulated, persistence decreased and copulations were shortened. In contrast, dopaminergic neurons of the ventral nerve cord promote copulation persistence and extend copulation duration. Thus, copulation duration in Drosophila is a product of gradually declining persistence controlled by opposing neuronal populations using conserved neurotransmission systems.

Thus, copulation duration in Drosophila is a product of gradually declining persistence controlled by opposing neuronal populations using conserved neurotransmission systems. The selection of appropriate behavior can be central to organismal success, in part because the performance of one behavior often excludes other potentially profitable activities. It follows that not only the selection but also the duration of individual behaviors is critical. The durations of behaviors are determined by interactions between the internal state of the animal and information from the external environment. The external world is constantly changing, and internal states are equally dynamic (Atkinson and Birch, 1970Atkinson J.W. Birch D. The dynamics of action. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, N.Y.1970Google Scholar). Time spent abstaining from a behavior often increases its associated drive, and the propensity to persist in a behavior often decreases with time spent performing the behavior. The neuronal processes underlying changes in persistence over time and integration of internal state with the external world are poorly understood. The durations of most animal behaviors lie on the interval time scale: from hundreds of milliseconds to a few hours (Buhusi and Meck, 2005Buhusi C.V. Meck W.H. What makes us tick? Functional and neural mechanisms of interval timing.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 755-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (1414) Google Scholar). The ability of animals to sense time on the interval scale was perhaps first documented in dogs by Pavlov, 1927Pavlov I.P. Conditioned Reflexes: An Investigation of the Physiological Activity of the Cerebral Cortex. Lecture IV: Delay.

Biol. 2006; 16: 1636-1640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), suggesting the existence of interval timing mechanisms throughout the animal kingdom. One behavior that takes place over a wide range of interval time is copulation, which ranges from ∼1.5 s in rabbits (Rubin and Azrin, 1967Rubin H.B. Azrin N.H. Temporal patterns of sexual behavior in rabbits as determined by an automatic recording technique.J. Exp. Anal. Behav. 1967; 10: 219-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) to 2–3 hr in the praying mantis (Prokop and Vaclav, 2005Prokop P. Vaclav R. Males respond to the risk of sperm competition in the sexually cannibalistic praying mantis, Mantis religiosa.Ethology. 2005; 111: 836-848Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Even within a genus, copulation lengths can vary dramatically from 40 s in Drosophila robusta (Grant, 1983Grant B.R. On the relationship between average copulation duration and insemination reaction in the genus Drosophila.Evolution. 1983; 37: 854-856Crossref Google Scholar) to 40 min in Drosophila immigrans (Grant, 1983Grant B.R. On the relationship between average copulation duration and insemination reaction in the genus Drosophila.Evolution. 1983; 37: 854-856Crossref Google Scholar). However, within a given species, copulation times can be highly reproducible, implying robust timing mechanisms. To investigate neuronal timekeeping on the interval scale, we studied the neural basis of copulation duration in Drosophila melanogaster (27.7 ± 0.7 min with an SD of 4.4 min in our wild-type Berlin stock). We provide evidence that a primary determinant of copulation duration is the persistence of the male to continue mating. This persistence declines over the course of a mating and interacts with information from the external environment to determine when copulation will cease. Because persistence decreases as the probability of successful mating increases, it serves as a critical component in an apparent cost-benefit analysis weighing the advantages of continued mating versus engaging in alternative behaviors. We show that the decrease in persistence is promoted by ∼8 GABAergic interneurons of the abdominal ganglion and opposed by dopaminergic neurons of the ventral nerve cord. The simplicity of this behavior, together with the small populations of neurons with conserved neurotransmission systems identified here, makes copulation duration an attractive model for studying neural coding of time and persistence. We carried out a screen for male flies that spend a disproportionate amount of time in copulation (see Experimental Procedures) by using the Gal4/UAS system (Brand and Perrimon, 1993Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Targeted gene expression as a means of altering cell fates and generating dominant phenotypes.Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to inactivate neurons by selective expression of the tetanus toxin light chain (Tnt). Tnt blocks most evoked synaptic neurotransmission by cleaving neuronal synaptobrevin (Sweeney et al., 1995Sweeney S.T. Broadie K. Keane J. Niemann H. O’Kane C.J. Targeted expression of tetanus toxin light chain in Drosophila specifically eliminates synaptic transmission and causes behavioral defects.Neuron. 1995; 14: 341-351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). We found a Gal4 line (NP5270 > Tnt) that caused males to spend, on average, six times longer in each copulation (Figure 1A). Copulation lengthening was not seen with mutant inactive Tnt, which lacks proteolytic activity (Sweeney et al., 1995Sweeney S.T. Broadie K. Keane J. Niemann H. O’Kane C.J. Targeted expression of tetanus toxin light chain in Drosophila specifically eliminates synaptic transmission and causes behavioral defects.Neuron. 1995; 14: 341-351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A). Other behaviors, such as proboscis extension in response to sucrose and circadian rhythms (see Experimental Procedures), were normal in NP5270 > Tnt males, suggesting that the timing phenotype is specific for copulation duration. Moreover, sexual behaviors were not generally aberrant in NP5270 > Tnt males, as they successfully courted females and initiated copulation with normal latency. The copulation postures and dismounting of all animals scored in this study also appeared normal (Figure 1B). This is in contrast to the “stuck” phenotype (Hall, 1981Hall J.C. Sex behavior mutants in Drosophila.BioScience. 1981; 31: 125-130Crossref Google Scholar) in which the male dismounts the female and struggles for hours to disengage his genitalia. That the males in this study remained mounted on the female throughout the entirety of the extended copulations, and that copulations terminated without struggle, indicate that the phenotypes do not result from defects in disengagement of genitalia. We examined the consequences of activating NP5270 neurons by expressing the heat-sensitive Drosophila cation channel TrpA1 (Hamada et al., 2008Hamada F.N. Rosenzweig M. Kang K. Pulver S.R. Ghezzi A. Jegla T.J. Garrity P.A. An internal thermal sensor controlling temperature preference in Drosophila.Nature. 2008; 454: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar) in NP5270 cells and assaying copulation duration with or without a shift to the activating temperature (30°C). TrpA1 is activated within seconds in response to a temperature shift and is resistant to spike frequency adaptation (Pulver et al., 2009Pulver S.R. Pashkovski S.L. Hornstein N.J. Garrity P.A. Griffith L.C. Temporal dynamics of neuronal activation by Channelrhodopsin-2 and TRPA1 determine behavioral output in Drosophila larvae.J. Neurophysiol. 2009; 101: 3075-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Although mating durations of control males decreased slightly at 30°C, temperature-shifted NP5270 > TrpA1 males showed a dramatic decrease in copulation duration to 4.8 ± 0.8 min (Figure 1C). We conclude that the activity of NP5270 neurons is a central determinant of copulation duration. To identify the location of these copulation duration neurons, we examined the expression of membrane-targeted GFP (CD8-GFP) driven by NP5270-Gal4. Within the central nervous system, NP5270 > GFP is detected in small numbers of neurons and in glial cells that ensheath the brain and ventral nerve cord (VNC) (Figure 1D, left). To subtract the glial component of the NP5270 expression pattern, we introduced a RepoGal80 transgene (Awasaki et al., 2008Awasaki T. Lai S.L. Ito K. Lee T. Organization and postembryonic development of glial cells in the adult central brain of Drosophila.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 13742-13753Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), which selectively inhibits the activity of Gal4 in glia (Figure 1D, center). RepoGal80 had no effect on the copulation duration phenotype of NP5270 > Tnt animals (Figure 1E). In contrast, a pan-neuronal Gal80 transgene, ElavGal80 (Yang et al., 2009Yang C.H. Rumpf S. Xiang Y. Gordon M.D. Song W. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Control of the postmating behavioral switch in Drosophila females by internal sensory neurons.Neuron. 2009; 61: 519-526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), completely suppressed the copulation duration phenotype (Figure 1E), demonstrating that the NP5270 copulation duration cells are neurons. NP5270 expression in the central nervous system is sparse, with small groups of neurons clustered in several regions of the brain and VNC (Figure 1D). To ask whether NP5270 copulation neurons reside in the brain or VNC, we used a TshGal80 transgene (Clyne and Miesenböck, 2008Clyne J.D. Miesenböck G. Sex-specific control and tuning of the pattern generator for courtship song in Drosophila.Cell. 2008; 133: 354-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) to suppress Gal4 activity in the VNC. NP5270 > CD8-GFP, TshGal80 animals retained GFP expression in the brain but lost expression in the VNC (Figure 1D, right). These animals showed no copulation duration phenotype with Tnt (Figure 1E), strongly suggesting that VNC and not brain neurons control copulation timing. To test this, we decapitated wild-type Berlin males within ∼3 min after copulation initiation (Figures 1F and 1G). Copulations with headless males terminated only slightly later than those with mock decapitated males (Figure 1G). These results are reminiscent of classic work on mating behavior of the decapitated male praying mantis (Roeder, 1935Roeder K.D. An experimental analysis of the sexual behavior of the praying mantis (Mantis religiosa L.).Biol. Bull. 1935; 69: 203-220Crossref Google Scholar) and similar results have previously been described in the fly (Tayler et al., 2012Tayler T.D. Pacheco D.A. Hergarden A.C. Murthy M. Anderson D.J. A neuropeptide circuit that coordinates sperm transfer and copulation duration in Drosophila.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 20697-20702Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We conclude that neurons in the VNC control copulation timing and that a critical subset of these neurons is marked by the NP5270 Gal4 line. Variation in copulation duration between animal species likely reflects species-specific timing requirements for optimal sperm and accessory factor transfer. To ask whether the circuit that times copulation duration in Drosophila melanogaster directly measures the transfer of sperm or male accessory gland fluids, we examined copulation duration in males with impaired fertility. It has been shown (Lefevre and Jonsson, 1962Lefevre Jr., G. Jonsson U.B. Sperm transfer, storage, displacement, and utilization in Drosophila melanogaster.Genetics. 1962; 47: 1719-1736PubMed Google Scholar, Linklater et al., 2007Linklater J.R. Wertheim B. Wigby S. Chapman T. Ejaculate depletion patterns evolve in response to experimental manipulation of sex ratio in Drosophila melanogaster.Evolution. 2007; 61: 2027-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and we confirm, that male fertility declines drastically after approximately three successive matings (Figure 2A, second green bar). However, these reproductively depleted males mate for the same duration as their fully fertile siblings (Figure 2A; compare the two left bars). Moreover, son-of-tudor males that lack germ cells and are therefore spermless (Xue and Noll, 2000Xue L. Noll M. Drosophila female sexual behavior induced by sterile males showing copulation complementation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 3272-3275Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) showed normal copulation duration (Figure 2A). Males that are missing the primary seminal fluid-producing organs, the accessory glands (via partial rescue of the paired mutation) (Bertuccioli et al., 1996Bertuccioli C. Fasano L. Jun S. Wang S. Sheng G. Desplan C. In vivo requirement for the paired domain and homeodomain of the paired segmentation gene product.Development. 1996; 122: 2673-2685PubMed Google Scholar, Xue and Noll, 2000Xue L. Noll M. Drosophila female sexual behavior induced by sterile males showing copulation complementation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 3272-3275Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), also have no copulation duration phenotype (Figure 2A). These results argue that mating time is not determined directly by the volume or rate of transfer of reproductive fluids. Experimental disruptions of copulation have shown that full fertilization in laboratory conditions is achieved by ∼8 min into copulation (Gilchrist and Partridge, 2000Gilchrist A.S. Partridge L. Why it is difficult to model sperm displacement in Drosophila melanogaster: the relation between sperm transfer and copulation duration.Evolution. 2000; 54: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). We confirmed these findings by mechanically separating copulating pairs at various times into copulation. When mating was truncated at 5 min into copulation, females never produced progeny. When matings were disrupted later in copulation, they were usually productive when disrupted at 10 min and always productive when disrupted at 15 min (Figure 2B). Moreover, when these disrupted matings were productive, they produced the same number of progeny as females for which copulation terminated naturally (Figure 2C). We next asked whether there was any difference in the rate or efficiency of the reproductive process in long-mating NP5270 > Tnt males. The extended matings of NP5270 > Tnt males were fertile and produced the same number of progeny as controls (Figure 2D). To ask whether the fertilization process is delayed in NP5270 > Tnt long-duration matings, we mechanically disrupted copulation of these animals 15 min after initiation. These copulations were fully fertile (Figure 2D). In contrast, copulations with short mating NP5270 > TrpA1 males were often infertile (open circles, Figure 2E). However, when these short matings were fertile, they were as productive as control matings (Figure 2F). Therefore, these copulation duration neurons do not control sperm and seminal fluid transfer, instead they allow sufficient time in copulation for these processes to occur. Because the last ∼15 min of copulation seem to be less important for fertility than the first ∼10 min, we asked whether the drive to remain in copulation diminishes as copulation progresses. During mating, the male is positioned on top of the female and is unable to escape stressful or dangerous circumstances without terminating copulation. To assay the persistence of copulation, we stressed copulating flies with heat shock by submerging the vial for 30 s in a water bath set to one of three different temperatures, 41°C, 37°C, or 23°C. These heat shocks, if sustained, incapacitate flies at different rates (41°C: 50% incapacitation at 3.2 min; 37°C: 50% incapacitation at 64.6 min; 23°C did not incapacitate flies; Figure 3A). Wild-type pairs almost never separated when heat shocked at any of the three temperatures after copulating for only 5 min (Figure 3B). However, pairs that had been copulating for 10 or more minutes truncated copulations in response to heat shock. The propensity to truncate copulation increased with increasing time into copulation as well as with increasing temperature of heat shock (Figure 3B). Toward the end of copulation, even the 23°C handling control disrupted most copulations. NP5270 > Tnt males did not truncate copulations in response to 41°C heat shock for at least 90 min into mating (Figure 3C), although their avoidance of 41°C when not copulating was as robust as in control males (Figure 3D). These results suggest that a decline in the persistence of mating as copulation progresses is promoted by NP5270 neurons. To challenge copulating pairs with a different sensory stimulus, we subjected them to 30 s of 6.3 ± 0.3 km/hr simulated wind introduced into the vial during copulation. This magnitude of simulated wind is classified as a “light breeze” on the Beaufort wind force scale (Met Office, 2010Met Office (2010). Fact sheet 6—The Beaufort Scale. http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/media/pdf/b/7/Fact_sheet_No._6.pdf.Google Scholar) and was often sufficient to knock over copulating pairs. Consistent with the heat shock results, pairs that had copulated for 5 min rarely separated in response to simulated wind, whereas all pairs separated when subjected to the wind 15 min into copulation (Figure 3E). Similar to the heat shock experiments, even the mock handling control caused moderate levels of mating disruption at 15 min into copulation (Figure 3E). Again similar to the heat shock data, synaptic silencing of NP5270 neurons prevented wind- and handling-induced copulation disruption at times far beyond those required for optimal sperm and seminal fluid transfer (Figure 3F). Importantly, none of these treatments caused the “stuck” mating phenotype (Hall, 1981Hall J.C. Sex behavior mutants in Drosophila.BioScience. 1981; 31: 125-130Crossref Google Scholar) indicating that dismounting and disengaging the genitalia are coordinated outputs of a copulation truncation program. Having shown that the activity of NP5270 neurons is necessary for the timely reduction in the persistence-like state of the male during copulation, we asked if stimulating these neurons via TrpA1 activation could induce a low-persistence state. A 41°C heat shock applied just 1 min into copulation terminated all copulations in which NP5270 neurons were synthetically activated (Figure 3G). As expected, none of these truncated copulations produced any progeny (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the activity of NP5270 neurons is necessary and sufficient to cause the reduction in persistence that occurs during copulation. NP5270 is an insertion of a Gal4-bearing P-element ∼400 bp upstream of the proximal transcription start site of CG17646 (CG17646-RA), which encodes a homolog of the mammalian ABCG1 transporter (Buchmann et al., 2007Buchmann J. Meyer C. Neschen S. Augustin R. Schmolz K. Kluge R. Al-Hasani H. Jürgens H. Eulenberg K. Wehr R. et al.Ablation of the cholesterol transporter adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter G1 reduces adipose cell size and protects against diet-induced obesity.Endocrinology. 2007; 148: 1561-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This region harbors dozens of P element insertions in various stock collections, including five additional Gal4 insertions from the same collection as NP5270 (Figure 4A). We crossed each of these five Gal4 insertions to UAS-Tnt and observed significant copulation lengthening in every case (Figure 4B). We analyzed the expression pattern and behavioral phenotype of NP2719 in greater detail because it had the sparsest VNC expression of all six Gal4 lines (Figure 4C). NP2719 > CD8-GFP showed selective expression in ∼12 cells in the distal segment of the VNC, the abdominal ganglion (Figures 4C, 5A , and 5B). NP2719 neurons appear to arborize throughout the abdominal ganglion (Figure 5A). NP2719 expression was not detected in neurons innervating the reproductive organs (data not shown). When we used NP2719 to drive expression of GFP targeted to synaptic vesicles (nsyb-GFP) (Estes et al., 2000Estes P.S. Ho G.L. Narayanan R. Ramaswami M. Synaptic localization and restricted diffusion of a Drosophila neuronal synaptobrevin—green fluorescent protein chimera in vivo.J. Neurogenet. 2000; 13: 233-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), we observed presumptive presynaptic termini throughout the abdominal ganglion (Figure 5C), suggesting that the NP2719-expressing cells are abdominal ganglion interneurons. When we activated the NP2719 neurons with TrpA1, copulation duration was significantly shortened (Figure 5D). Thus, these ∼12 neurons represent a compact subset of the neurons whose activity determines the duration of copulation. To identify the molecules through which these interneurons communicate information about copulation duration, we used NP5270-Gal4 and NP2719-Gal4 to drive UAS-RNAi transgenes directed against components of the major neurotransmitter systems of the fly. Of all the lines screened, only RNAi knockdown of Glutamic acid decarboxylase 1 (Gad1) or Vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) phenocopied the effects of silencing the neurons with Tnt (Figure 5E). Gad1 encodes the enzyme that synthesizes the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and VGAT packages GABA into synaptic vesicles. Staining for GABA showed colocalization with the cell bodies of 70% ± 6% or ∼8 of the 12 NP2719-Gal4 abdominal ganglion neurons (Figures 5F and 6G ). GABA immunoreactivity in NP2719 neurons was abolished in NP2719 > Gad1-RNAi animals, indicating that our RNAi was effective (Figure 5G). GABA is likely the sole effector of copulation duration released by these neurons because stimulating NP2719 neurons via TrpA1 activation while knocking down Gad1 resulted in long copulations (Figure 5H). Similar results were obtained using NP5270-Gal4 (data not shown). Thus GABA release from ∼8 male-specific abdominal ganglion interneurons is a critical determinant of copulation duration and persistence. Unlike in other species of flies (Mazzi et al., 2009Mazzi D. Kesäniemi J. Hoikkala A. Klappert K. Sexual conflict over the duration of copulation in Drosophila montana: why is longer better?.BMC Evol. Biol. 2009; 9: 132Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), in Drosophila melanogaster copulation duration is controlled by the male (Acebes et al., 2004Acebes A. Grosjean Y. Everaerts C.

Directional selection for duration of copulation in Drosophila melanogaster.Genetics. 1967; 56: 233-239PubMed Google Scholar), with little influence of the female. To ask whether the identified GABAergic neurons were sexually dimorphic, we examined the expression of NP5270 and NP2719 in females. Although brain and thoracic ganglion expression of these lines was similar in males and females, expression was not detected in female abdominal ganglion neurons (Figures 6A and 6B; data not shown). To explore the molecular basis of this sexual dimorphism, we examined the expression of Fruitless (Fru) and Doublesex (Dsx) in NP2719 abdominal ganglion neurons. fru and dsx are transcription factors that are spliced into male- and female-specific isoforms by sex-specific splicing factors (Dickson, 2008Dickson B.J.

Double labeling of male NP2719 > CD8-GFP neurons with antibodies raised against male-specific isoforms of these proteins (FruM or DsxM) revealed that the majority were labeled with anti-DsxM, whereas none were stained by anti-FruM (Figures 6C and 6D). Moreover, none of the NP5270 or NP2719 VNC neurons were labeled by Fru-Flp (Yu et al., 2010Yu J.Y. Kanai M.I. Demir E. Jefferis G.S. Dickson B.J. Cellular organization of the neural circuit that drives Drosophila courtship behavior.Curr. Biol. 2010; 20: 1602-1614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) (Figure 6E), arguing that they did not express fru at any point during development. Finally, when we targeted dsx with an RNAi transgene under the control of NP5270-Gal4 or NP2719-Gal4, the sexually dimorphic abdominal ganglion expression was lost (Figure 6F). We conclude that dsx instructs sexual dimorphism in these neurons. Dopamine signaling has been implicated in various motivated behaviors in species as diverse as insects and humans (Perry and Barron, 2013Perry C.J. Barron A.B. Neural mechanisms of reward in insects.Annu. Rev. Entomol. 2013; 58: 543-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, Wise, 2004Wise R.A. Dopamine, learning and motivation.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 483-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (2332) Google Scholar). Having shown that copulation duration is a product of declining persistence, we hypothesized a role for dopamine signaling in copulation duration. We stimulated dopaminergic neurons by driving TrpA1 expression with Gal4 under the control of the cis-regulatory DNA of pale, which encodes tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in dopamine synthesis (TH-Gal4) (Friggi-Grelin et al., 2003Friggi-Grelin F. Coulom H. Meller M. Gomez D. Hirsh J. Birman S. Targeted gene expression in Drosophila dopaminergic cells using regulatory sequences from tyrosine hydroxylase.J. Neurobiol. 2003; 54: 618-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Activating TH-Gal4 neurons in males dramatically extended copulation duration (Figure 7A), but did not noticeably affect fertility or lead to “stuck” phenotypes. This extension of copulation duration was associated with a lengthening of the period of high-persistence copulation (Figure 7B), demonstrating that dopamine signaling promotes copulation persistence. TshGal80 largely suppressed TH-Gal4 activity in the VNC (Figure 7C), whereas Gal4 activity in the brain was not noticeably affected (data not shown). TshGal80 suppressed the ability of TH-Gal4 neurons to extend copulation duration when stimulated by TrpA1 activation (Figure 7D), indicating that the dopaminergic neurons controlling copulation duration reside in the VNC. Our attempts to silence TH-Gal4 neurons or to block dopamine processing led either to lethality or to a suppression of sexual behavior, preventing an assessment of copulation duration. Instead, we examined mutations in the four reported Drosophila dopamine receptors. Surprisingly, loss-of-function mutations in all four dopamine receptors resulted in reduced copulation duration relative to genetic background controls (Figures 7E–7H).

Mutations within several ion channels known to regulate dopamine neuron physiology have been linked to mental illnesses, including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (Liao and Soong, 2010Liao P.

Suppression of SK-mediated currents by the selective channel blocker apamin or the negative modulator NS8539 attenuates the refractory after-hyperpolarization (AHP) phase of the action potential and increases spike firing irregularity in slice (Shepard and Bunney, 1991Shepard P.D.

Effect of microinjections of apamin into the A10 dopamine region of rats: a behavioral and neurochemical analysis.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 254: 711-719PubMed Google Scholar), consistent with elevated dopamine release. An increase in the ratio of phasic-to-tonic dopamine signals has been proposed as an underlying contributor to the disregulation of corticostriatal information gating associated with schizophrenia (Grace, 1991Grace A.A. Phasic versus tonic dopamine release and the modulation of dopamine system responsivity: a hypothesis for the etiology of schizophrenia.Neuroscience. 1991; 41: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar). The specific behavioral impact of altering these ratios through a cell-autonomous manipulation of dopamine neuron activity patterns is not known. Intriguingly, a spontaneous mutation in KCNN3 (hSK3Δ) was identified in a patient with schizophrenia (Bowen et al., 2001Bowen T. Williams N. Norton N. Spurlock G. Wittekindt O.H. Morris-Rosendahl D.J. Williams H. Brzustowicz L. Hoogendoorn B. Zammit S. et al.Mutation screening of the KCNN3 gene reveals a rare frameshift mutation.Mol. Psychiatry. 2001; 6: 259-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and was later demonstrated to dominantly suppress SK-mediated currents in cell culture (Miller et al., 2001Miller M.J. Rauer H. Tomita H. Rauer H. Gargus J.J. Gutman G.A. Cahalan M.D. Chandy K.G. Nuclear localization and dominant-negative suppression by a mutant SKCa3 N-terminal channel fragment identified in a patient with schizophrenia.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27753-27756Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The extent to which this mutation influences dopamine neuron firing patterns is not known but could provide key insight into the effects of activity pattern disruption on specific dimensions of behavior associated with mental illness. hSK3Δ is a frame-shift mutation in exon 1 of KCNN3, resulting in a premature stop codon and expression of only the first 283 amino acids of the protein, prior to the first transmembrane domain (Figure 1A; Bowen et al., 2001Bowen T. Williams N. Norton N. Spurlock G. Wittekindt O.H. Morris-Rosendahl D.J. Williams H. Brzustowicz L. Hoogendoorn B.

Chem. 2001; 276: 27753-27756Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To elucidate the potential impact of hSK3Δ on dopamine physiology and behavior, we selectively expressed hSK3Δ in dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA). This mutation suppressed endogenous SK-mediated currents, altered spike firing patterns ex vivo and in vivo, potentiated NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-mediated currents, increased evoked calcium signals, and amplified dopamine release. Behaviorally, altered dopamine physiology associated with hSK3Δ expression disrupted sensory gating and heightened sensitivity to a psychomimetic drug. These behaviors were recapitulated using an independent mouse model of transient, reversible enhancement of dopamine neuron excitability. Together, these results reveal the influence of a disease-related KCNN3 mutation on dopamine neuron physiology and support the hypothesis that dopamine neuron activity pattern disregulation is a contributing factor to specific dimensions of behavioral disruption. To selectively express hSK3Δ in dopamine neurons, we generated a Cre-dependent adeno-associated viral vector (AAV-FLEx-hSK3ΔGFP; Figure 1B). Injection of AAV-FLEx-hSK3ΔGFP into the ventral-medial midbrain of mice expressing Cre recombinase under control of the endogenous dopamine transporter locus (Slc6a3Cre/+; Zhuang et al., 2005Zhuang X. Masson J. Gingrich J.A. Rayport S. Hen R. Targeted gene expression in dopamine and serotonin neurons of the mouse brain.J. Neurosci. Methods. 2005; 143: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) resulted in highly specific expression, largely restricted to the VTA (Figures 1C and S1 available online). hSK3ΔGFP protein localizes to dopamine neuron processes, similar to endogenous SK3 (Wolfart et al., 2001Wolfart J. Neuhoff H. Franz O. Roeper J. Differential expression of the small-conductance, calcium-activated potassium channel SK3 is critical for pacemaker control in dopaminergic midbrain neurons.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3443-3456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A portion of the protein is also trafficked to the nucleus, due to unmasking of two canonical nuclear localization sequences (NLSs; Figures 1C and S1), as reported in cell culture (Miller et al., 2001Miller M.J. Rauer H. Tomita H. Rauer H. Gargus J.J. Gutman G.A. Cahalan M.D. Chandy K.G. Nuclear localization and dominant-negative suppression by a mutant SKCa3 N-terminal channel fragment identified in a patient with schizophrenia.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27753-27756Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To eliminate the possibility that nuclear localization is responsible for any effects on cell physiology, we generated a second construct in which the NLSs were removed (AAV-FLEx-hSK3ΔNLS-GFP; Figure S1). This truncation redistributed the protein to the soma and maintained localization to processes (Figure 1C). To determine whether hSK3Δ suppresses endogenous SK currents, we evoked SK-mediated tail currents in dopamine neurons in an acute VTA slice preparation (Figure 1D). hSK3Δ reduced these currents regardless of the presence of the NLS but was not as robust as inhibition by apamin (Köhler et al., 1996Köhler M. Hirschberg B. Bond C.T. Kinzie J.M. Marrion N.V. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. Small-conductance, calcium-activated potassium channels from mammalian brain.Science. 1996; 273: 1709-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar; Figures 1E–1G). To determine whether expression of hSK3ΔGFP in dopamine neurons alters action potential waveforms, as described for pharmacological suppression of SK currents with apamin (Shepard and Bunney, 1991Shepard P.D. Bunney B.S. Repetitive firing properties of putative dopamine-containing neurons in vitro: regulation by an apamin-sensitive Ca(2+)-activated K+ conductance.Exp. Brain Res. 1991; 86: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, Wolfart et al., 2001Wolfart J. Neuhoff H. Franz O. Roeper J.

Tuning the excitability of midbrain dopamine neurons by modulating the Ca2+ sensitivity of SK channels.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 1883-1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we recorded spontaneous action potential firing in slice. In agreement with reduced SK currents, hSK3Δ significantly reduced AHP amplitudes (Figures 2A and 2B ). Other action potential properties, such as peak and threshold voltage, were not different from controls (Figure S2). Consistent with a role for SK channels in regulating pacemaker precision, pharmacological inhibition of SK channels increases irregularity of action potential firing in slice (Wolfart et al., 2001Wolfart J. Neuhoff H. Franz O. Roeper J. Differential expression of the small-conductance, calcium-activated potassium channel SK3 is critical for pacemaker control in dopaminergic midbrain neurons.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3443-3456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Ji et al., 2009Ji H. Hougaard C. Herrik K.F. Strøbaek D. Christophersen P. Shepard P.D. Tuning the excitability of midbrain dopamine neurons by modulating the Ca2+ sensitivity of SK channels.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 1883-1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Similar to apamin, expression of either hSK3ΔGFP or hSK3ΔNLS-GFP increased spike-timing irregularity, measured by the coefficient of variation of the interspike interval (CV-ISI; Figures 2C and 2D); however, overall spike frequency was unchanged (Figure S2). Together, these results demonstrate that hSK3Δ is a dominant-negative mutation that suppresses SK channel function in dopamine neurons. Suppression of SK channels by apamin or the negative modulator NS8593 alters activity patterns in dopamine neurons in vivo, with tonically firing neurons becoming irregular (as observed in slice) and irregular neurons becoming bursty (Waroux et al., 2005Waroux O. Massotte L. Alleva L. Graulich A. Thomas E. Liégeois J.F. Scuvée-Moreau J. Seutin V. SK channels control the firing pattern of midbrain dopaminergic neurons in vivo.Eur. J.

Christophersen P. Shepard P.D. Pharmacological modulation of the gating properties of small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels alters the firing pattern of dopamine neurons in vivo.J. Neurophysiol. 2010; 104: 1726-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The reciprocal holds for the positive SK channel modulator NS309 (Herrik et al., 2010Herrik K.F. Christophersen P. Shepard P.D. Pharmacological modulation of the gating properties of small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels alters the firing pattern of dopamine neurons in vivo.J. Neurophysiol. 2010; 104: 1726-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To establish the impact of hSK3Δ on dopamine neuron activity patterns in vivo, we monitored spontaneous activity using chronic tetrode recordings in freely moving mice (Figure S3). Putative dopamine neurons were identified based on firing rate and sensitivity to autoreceptor activation by the D2-selective agonist quinpirole (Figure S3; Zweifel et al., 2009Zweifel L.S. Parker J.G. Lobb C.J. Rainwater A. Wall V.Z. Fadok J.P. Darvas M. Kim M.J. Mizumori S.J. Paladini C.A. et al.Disruption of NMDAR-dependent burst firing by dopamine neurons provides selective assessment of phasic dopamine-dependent behavior.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 7281-7288Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The proportion of dopamine neurons firing in a tonic, bursty, or irregular pattern were characterized based on their ISI distributions (Figure 3A; Herrik et al., 2010Herrik K.F. Christophersen P. Shepard P.D. Pharmacological modulation of the gating properties of small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels alters the firing pattern of dopamine neurons in vivo.J. Neurophysiol. 2010; 104: 1726-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Relative to controls, hSK3Δ-expressing mice exhibited a greater proportion of bursty cells and a reduced proportion of tonically active neurons, with little effect on the proportion of cells firing an intermediate (irregular) pattern (Bursty: GFP 43% versus hSK3Δ 58%; Tonic: GFP 33% versus hSK3Δ 17%; Irregular: GFP 24% versus hSK3Δ 22%; chi-squared, p < 0.05; Figure 3A). Redistribution of the proportion of neurons within spike pattern categories was reflected as a significant increase in the high-frequency range of the average population ISI distribution (Figure 3B). Consistent with an increase in the number of bursty cells, we also observed a significant increase in the frequency of burst events and the percentage of spikes fired in burst in putative dopamine neurons from hSK3ΔGFP mice relative to GFP controls (Figures 3C and 3D). Additionally, within bursts the ISI of the first two spikes was decreased (Figure 3E) and the ISI of the second two spikes trended toward decrease (Figure S3), indicative of heightened firing rate during burst initiation. In agreement with the increased number of burst events and a higher frequency of spikes at burst onset, overall firing rate was increased by hSK3ΔGFP (Figure 3F) and was more steeply correlated with burst set rate when compared to controls (Figure 3G). Other burst parameters, including spikes per burst and burst duration, were unaltered, and the frequency of spikes not associated with a burst was unchanged (Figure S3). Analysis of neurons recorded on the same tetrode as putative dopamine neurons, but outside the bounds of dopamine neuron classification, did not show significant differences in firing rate or burst properties (Table S1; see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). To characterize the burst properties of putative dopamine neurons described above, we used a conventional method in which burst onset is marked by two spikes with an ISI ≤ 80 ms and offset is marked by a subsequent ISI ≥ 160 ms (Grace and Bunney, 1984aGrace A.A. Bunney B.S. The control of firing pattern in nigral dopamine neurons: burst firing.J. Neurosci. 1984; 4: 2877-2890Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Due to the frequency-dependent nature of this method, there is the potential for spurious detection of burst activity in cells with higher firing rates; therefore, we performed additional analysis using a modified method of burst detection. We set the threshold for burst initiation to three spikes occurring within the mean of the ISI, allowing us to assess transient rate increases relative to the overall firing rate of the cell. Similar to conventional burst detection, this method also detected a significant increase in burst events and a decrease in the ISI of the first spikes within a burst in hSK3ΔGFP-expressing mice compared to controls (Figures S3). Other burst properties were largely similar to those detected with the conventional method (Figure S3). Increased burst firing and elevated firing rate of putative dopamine neurons is consistent with suppression of SK currents enhancing the excitability of dopamine neurons (Ji et al., 2009Ji H. Hougaard C. Herrik K.F. Strøbaek D. Christophersen P. Shepard P.D. Tuning the excitability of midbrain dopamine neurons by modulating the Ca2+ sensitivity of SK channels.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 1883-1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The mechanism of this enhanced excitability is not well understood but could involve modulation of glutamatergic synaptic transmission. It is known that SK channel blockade facilitates NMDA-evoked burst firing of dopamine neurons in slice (Seutin et al., 1993Seutin V. Johnson S.W. North R.A. Apamin increases NMDA-induced burst-firing of rat mesencephalic dopamine neurons.Brain Res. 1993; 630: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, Johnson and Seutin, 1997Johnson S.W.

Lett. 1997; 231: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Additionally, in other brain regions, SK2 channels colocalize with NMDARs in the postsynaptic density (PSD) where they form a calcium-mediated feedback loop (Faber et al., 2005Faber E.S. Delaney A.J. Sah P. SK channels regulate excitatory synaptic transmission and plasticity in the lateral amygdala.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, Ngo-Anh et al., 2005Ngo-Anh T.J. Bloodgood B.L. Lin M. Sabatini B.L. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. SK channels and NMDA receptors form a Ca2+-mediated feedback loop in dendritic spines.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 642-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, Lin et al., 2008Lin M.T. Luján R. Watanabe M. Adelman J.P. Maylie J. SK2 channel plasticity contributes to LTP at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 170-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar); thus, hSK3Δ may enhance excitability of dopamine neurons by potentiating NMDAR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs). To determine whether SK3 colocalizes with NMDARs in dopamine neurons, we performed immunoelectron microscopy in the VTA of wild-type mice. Immunogold labeling for the NMDAR subunit NR1 and for SK3 revealed a close juxtaposition of the two channels within the PSD (Figure 4A). Quantification of the distribution of gold particles within the PSD revealed similar profiles of both NR1 and SK3 (Figure 4B). To test whether suppression of SK channels alters NMDAR-mediated currents in dopamine neurons, we monitored evoked EPSCs in acute slices before and after addition of apamin. Cells were recorded in a zero magnesium solution to relieve the blockade of NMDARs, and NMDAR and AMPAR currents were isolated by bath application of CNQX or AP5, respectively. In GFP control neurons, SK channel blockade with apamin increased amplitude and charge transfer of NMDAR EPSCs without affecting AMPAR currents (Figures 4C and S4). The effect of apamin on NMDAR EPSCs was largely occluded in neurons expressing hSK3ΔGFP (Figures 4C and S4). Consistent with this observation, NMDAR EPSCs from hSK3ΔGFP-expressing cells had a slower decay time than did EPSCs from control neurons (Figure 4D). Moreover, bath application of NMDA evoked larger currents in hSK3ΔGFP-expressing dopamine neurons relative to controls (Figure 4E). NMDAR activation facilitates burst firing of dopamine neurons and phasic dopamine release in vivo (Chergui et al., 1993Chergui K. Charléty P.J. Akaoka H. Saunier C.F. Brunet J.L. Buda M.

Using locusts as models, we gained some understanding of the representation formats for simple odors in the first three relays of its olfactory system—the antennal lobe (AL), mushroom body (MB), and beta lobe (bL)—and of the computations carried out by these circuits (Cassenaer and Laurent, 2007Cassenaer S.

Intensity versus identity coding in an olfactory system.Neuron. 2003; 39: 991-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). We also discovered that odors at different concentrations generate families (low-dimensional manifolds) of spatiotemporal representations (Stopfer et al., 2003Stopfer M. Jayaraman V. Laurent G. Intensity versus identity coding in an olfactory system.Neuron. 2003; 39: 991-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), providing a neural substrate for concentration invariance. In this study, we turn to odor mixtures. Most natural odors comprise many components, usually mixed in particular ratios. Mixtures can be perceived as wholes (“coffee,” “grapefruit”) (Jinks and Laing, 1999Jinks A. Laing D.G. A limit in the processing of components in odour mixtures.Perception. 1999; 28: 395-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), but they can also be classified into categories, with various degrees of refinement (“fruity” → “citrusy” → “grapefruit”). Humans can typically identify no more than ∼3 components, but sometimes they can identify as many as 8–12 familiar components in a blend (Jinks and Laing, 1999Jinks A. Laing D.G. A limit in the processing of components in odour mixtures.Perception. 1999; 28: 395-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and insects and rodents can likely do better (Hurst and Beynon, 2004Hurst J.L. Beynon R.J. Scent wars: the chemobiology of competitive signalling in mice.Bioessays. 2004; 26: 1288-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, Reinhard et al., 2010Reinhard J. Sinclair M. Srinivasan M.V. Claudianos C. Honeybees learn odour mixtures via a selection of key odorants.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e9110Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Also, natural odors such as floral scents can vary from one flower to the next or from one time of the day to another (Wright and Thomson, 2005Wright G.A. Thomson M.G. Odor Perception and Variability in Natural Odor Scenes. Elsevier, Amsterdam2005Google Scholar). For foraging insects, this necessitates that animals be able to identify individual flowers (to prevent costly repeated visits) and that they generalize (so as to sample flowers of the same variety, species, or type) (Reinhard et al., 2010Reinhard J. Sinclair M. Srinivasan M.V. Claudianos C. Honeybees learn odour mixtures via a selection of key odorants.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e9110Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, Wright et al., 2008Wright G.A. Kottcamp S.M. Thomson M.G.

Odor Perception and Variability in Natural Odor Scenes. Elsevier, Amsterdam2005Google Scholar). How does the brain solve both discrimination and generalization problems? Our goal was to find out, using the locust system, whether and how the formats of representations for odors support these computations. We begin with binary mixtures (Figures 1A–1D; Experimental Procedures) and then expand to multicomponent mixtures with a set of eight monomolecular odors, paraffin oil (their dilution substrate), and 32 of the 211 possible mixtures of two, three, four, five, and eight of those odors (44 stimuli in all, see Figure 1E; Experimental Procedures). We recorded from 342 projection neurons (PNs, the analog of vertebrate mitral cells) and 209 Kenyon cells (KCs, the mushroom body neurons) in 61 animals. Our primary data are neural responses to odor mixtures of up to eight pure components. Unless otherwise noted, the response window is defined as the 1 s period from 0.1 s to 1.1 s after odor onset (the 0.1 s offset is to account mostly for stimulus delays external to the animal), and the baseline window is the 1 s period from −1.1 s to −0.1 s before odor onset. We first examined the responses of single PNs to binary mixtures of octanol and citral. Figures 2A–2D show the response of a sample PN to the mixtures tested. The responses are mixture specific, reliable, and temporally patterned, as previously observed for PN odor responses (Perez-Orive et al., 2002Perez-Orive J. Mazor O. Turner G.C. Cassenaer S. Wilson R.I. Laurent G. Oscillations and sparsening of odor representations in the mushroom body.Science. 2002; 297: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, Stopfer et al., 2003Stopfer M. Jayaraman V. Laurent G. Intensity versus identity coding in an olfactory system.Neuron. 2003; 39: 991-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). We examined the extent to which mixture responses (of single PNs) could be explained by component responses. Figure 2C illustrates that mixture responses can deviate from the sums of the corresponding component responses. We therefore tested how well weighted sums of the componentsfit(t)=acitral(t)+boctanol(t)+c,describe mixture responses. The citral and octanol response functions [citral(t) and octanol(t)] were expressed as mean firing rates across trials in consecutive 50 ms bins, in response to the concentrations present in the mixture. We tested several models that differed by the constraints on the fit coefficients, allowing the component responses a temporal jitter of up to three time bins (Table 1).Table 1Constraints on Fit Coefficients in Mixture Response ModelsModelConstraintConstanta = b = 0Unit citrala = 1, b = 0Unit octanola = 0, b = 1Unit mixturea = 1, b = 1Scaled citralb = 0Scaled octanola = 0Scaled mixturea = bFree mixtureNo constraints Open table in a new tab We fit all mixture responses of every PN to each one of these models and used Bayesian model selection to select among them (see Experimental Procedures and Supplemental Information available online for details). Figure 2E shows some fits for the response of the PN in Figures 2A–2D to the mixture cit140:oct120. The mixture response is in black; component responses are red (oct120) and green (cit140). The selected fit was a scaled and lagged version of the citral response (∗, R2 = 0.49). The better fit (R2 = 0.51) of the free mixture model did not justify its increased complexity. We summarize the results of this fitting procedure over the population in Figure 2F (see also Supplemental Information). The three matrices in Figure 2F are mixtures × PNs. Matrix cells are colored according to the coefficients (≠0) in the fit: red for octanol, green for citral, yellow for both, and black for neither (i.e., constant model). We sorted the cells by their preference for responses of one type or another and then by their center of gravity within each group. The matrix on the left shows cells for which the majority of their nonconstant responses were best fit using pure citral responses; the second matrix shows the same with octanol. The small matrix on the right shows cells for which the majority of their nonconstant responses were best fit using both component responses or for which no component response dominated. Not shown are 24 PNs for which all mixture responses were fit best by a constant model. Most fits were of the citral or octanol type, i.e., the mixture response was best fit by scaling the response to one component. Varying degrees of concentration sensitivity were observed: some PNs responded at all dilutions of their “dominant” component; others did so only above a particular concentration (specific to that PN and odor). Such responses would facilitate concentration-invariant and concentration-sensitive computations, respectively. Because odor representations by PNs are highly distributed and varied in time (Figure 2; Laurent and Davidowitz, 1994Laurent G. Davidowitz H.

Neurosci. 2007; 27: 1659-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), and because KCs have very short effective temporal integration windows (Perez-Orive et al., 2004Perez-Orive J. Bazhenov M.

Oscillations and sparsening of odor representations in the mushroom body.Science. 2002; 297: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar), it is useful to examine PN responses as time series of instantaneous population vectors, or trajectories, and visualize them in an appropriately reduced state space (Broome et al., 2006Broome B.M.

Figure 3A illustrates these PN population trajectories in response to octanol (red), citral (green), and their 1:1 mixture (yellow), after dimension reduction by locally linear embedding (LLE) (Roweis and Saul, 2000Roweis S.T. Saul L.K. Nonlinear dimensionality reduction by locally linear embedding.Science. 2000; 290: 2323-2326Crossref PubMed Scopus (11830) Google Scholar). The nonlinear nature of LLE makes quantitative comparisons between trajectories difficult. Therefore, we also show correlation measures between the trajectories in the full space. The nine matrices in Figure 3B plot the correlation distance (Dc, see Experimental Procedures) within (matrices along diagonal) and between (168 PN vector time series over 3 s) the responses to the three stimuli in Figure 3A, calculated across different trials with each stimulus. We summarized these matrices by the minimum value of each of the submatrices and plotted these values as a matrix of min Dc (Figure 3C). We then combined these min-Dc matrices with each corresponding set of trajectories (Figures 3D–3F and 5A–5C). The combination of correlation measures and LLE trajectories provides both quantitative and qualitative descriptions of the data. Figure 3D shows the same data as Figure 3A with the associated min-Dc matrix. The dimension-reduced mixture trajectories (yellow) lie in between those for the two components, an impression supported by intermediate correlation values (inset). Figure 3E represents concentration series for the three stimuli (cit, cit:oct, and oct). Extending previous results (Stopfer et al., 2003Stopfer M. Jayaraman V. Laurent G. Intensity versus identity coding in an olfactory system.Neuron. 2003; 39: 991-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), concentration series for 1:1 mixtures, as for single odors, generated families of similar trajectories clustered by odor rather than concentration (see also matrix inset). Finally, we “morphed” one odor into the other in 11 intermediate concentration steps (Figure 3F). Qualitatively, the population trajectory corresponding to one odor appeared to shift gradually, an impression that is supported by the correlation matrix inset. We then directly tested whether the qualitative impressions provided by the LLE plots in Figures 3D–3F hold in the full (not dimension-reduced) space. Figure 3D suggests that the 1:1 mixture trajectory (yellow) lies almost exactly between those for the two components, an impression supported by intermediate correlation distance values (inset). To confirm this impression in the full space, we computed, for consecutive 100 ms time bins, the projection of the population vector for the mixture onto the plane spanned by the vectors for the two components. Then, we computed the angle between this mixture projection and the time-matched vector for citral as a fraction of the angle between the simultaneous vectors for the two single odors. This yielded the “projection angle fraction” (PAF) with respect to citral, which is by definition 0 for citral, 1 for octanol, and intermediate for mixtures (values less than 0 are not possible; values greater than 1 are possible, though rare). Figure 3G shows the time course of the mean PAF ± SEM (shading) computed over the ten trials, for “mostly citral” (cit140:30oct, green), 1:1 mixture (140cit:140oct, yellow), and “mostly octanol” (30cit:140oct, red), in consecutive 100 ms time bins. During baseline, all three odors had a PAF of ∼0.5 (as expected from cells firing randomly and independently at the average baseline rate). At odor onset, however, the PAF for “mostly citral” dropped to ∼0.1 while that of “mostly octanol” rose to ∼0.9, indicating high similarity to the representations of pure citral and pure octanol, respectively. Confirming the impression from Figure 3D, the PAF for the 1:1 mixture remained mostly near 0.5 (the low variability indicates that this value was stimulus driven and not simply due to noise). Nearly 75% of the magnitude of the population vector lay in the projection plane during the early phase of the response (Figure S3A), and the PAFs computed with respect to octanol were equal to 1 minus the PAFs to citral (Figure S3B). Hence, we conclude that the trajectory for the 1:1 mixture indeed lies almost exactly in between the trajectories for the two components. Figure 3E suggests that concentration series for single odors and 1:1 mixtures generate families of closely related trajectories (lower dimensional manifolds), clustered by odor rather than concentration (see matrix inset). We quantified this impression by temporally concatenating the binned population vectors for each trajectory (yielding one large vector for each trajectory for the time window of interest). We then computed Rand indices (Rand, 1971Rand W.M. Objective criteria for evaluation of clustering methods.J. Am. Stat. Assoc. 1971; 66: 846Crossref Scopus (4103) Google Scholar) to measure the agreement between clustering by correlation distance and clustering by odor or between clustering by correlation distance and clustering by concentration (Figure 3H; range 0–1; 1 = perfect agreement, see Experimental Procedures). At baseline, both comparisons yielded values close to chance (dashed lines). During the response window, clustering was clearly by odor. Figure 3F suggests that when one odor is morphed into another, the population trajectory shifts gradually (rather than abruptly, as reported in zebrafish [Niessing and Friedrich, 2010Niessing J. Friedrich R.W. Olfactory pattern classification by discrete neuronal network states.Nature. 2010; 465: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar]) toward that for the other odor, passing through their 1:1 mixture trajectory. We quantified this by fitting, in consecutive 100 ms time bins, the correlation distance between each PN vector (full space) for the mixture and that for citral, as a function of the concentration ratio (log10 of the ratio of the concentrations in the mixture), to constant, linear, one-, and two-step functions. We then used Bayesian model selection (see Experimental Procedures) to rank the models at each time by their fit to the data while penalizing them for complexity. In Figure 3I, the time course of the logarithms of the resulting posterior probabilities for each model relative to that for the linear model are shown (mean ± SEM [shading] over trials). At baseline, the constant model is best, indicating no relation between distance and mixture level. Upon odor onset, the linear model quickly dominates and remains superior for most of the response window. Figure S3C shows the results when using fraction octanol as the independent variable, yielding similar results. Figure S3D shows the data and model fits at different times, allowing visual confirmation of the superiority of the linear fit. The superiority of the linear model over the step models suggests that the encoding space defined by PNs is not discretized (at least within the range and resolution of concentrations tested) and allows the spread of odor representations to accommodate fractional changes in the stimulus. Eight molecules were chosen to be chemically distinct (Figure 1E) and their concentrations adjusted to evoke electroantennograms that were reliable, small, and comparable in amplitude (Figures S1C and S1D) to compensate for differences in vapor pressure or receptor activation and to ensure operation far from saturation. We determined the extent to which the mixture responses of single PNs could be explained by their responses to single components in the mixture. The response of a PN to an n-component mixture was regressed on the constant model (no inputs) and all 2n − 1 possible combinations of single-component responses. For each such input combination, we computed the regression for the unit-, scaled- and free-coefficient models, as well as for lagged versions of these. We then determined the best model using Bayesian model selection (see Experimental Procedures). In Figure 4A, we show the response of a sample PN to the mixture ABCD and to the components (left) and some of the fits (right). The selected model in this case was a unit-scaled mixture of odors A, B, and C (∗, R2 = 0.68). The better fit of a more complex model (the free mixture “A and B and C and D,” R2 = 0.75) did not justify its increased complexity. In Figure 4B, we summarize the results of the model fitting procedure over all PNs and all mixtures. The layout is similar to that used for binary mixtures (Figure 2F), extended to eight components, and contains nine PN × mixture matrices. Matrix cells are colored according to the component responses used in each fit according to the legend on the right. PNs have been sorted according to the single-component response (if any) that explained the majority of their nonconstant responses and then by the center of mass of their “best-component” responses within each group. The A,B,…,Z matrices show the PNs for which a single component dominated. The columns within each matrix have been arranged so that odors containing the component come first followed by those that do not contain the component, both in order of increasing mixture complexity. The “Mixture or Ambiguous” matrix shows the six PNs for which more than one component response was always required to explain the majority of the nonconstant responses and the ten PNs in which no single-component response dominated the fits. Not shown are the 34 PNs for which the single components did not provide an adequate fit for any mixture. These data are replotted along with measures of fit quality and further analyses in Figures S4A–S4G. Figure 4B shows that for each of the eight components, there exist PNs whose responses to mixtures can, in most cases, be fit most conservatively using the single response to that component. Dilution effects are present, with some PNs yielding fits only at the binary mixture level, others up to the three-mixture level, etc. Such a distribution of response types would allow both concentration-invariant and concentration-sensitive types of olfactory computation. The LLE trajectories corresponding to the eight single-component odors are shown in Figure 5A. Consistent with the odors’ distinct chemical composition, these trajectories did not cluster (see also minimum correlation distances in inset). The observed lack of clustering suggests large differences between the evoked PN response patterns, consistent with our diverse choice of single odors. Adding components to a single odor, W (Figure 5B), caused the mixture trajectories to deviate from that for W. Incremental changes in the population trajectory, however, decreased as the number of components in the mixture increased (see also minimum correlation distance matrix, inset), consistent with the decrease in the fractional change to the stimulus with each component addition. This observation was repeated with the other odors and quantified by analysis in full PN space (data not shown). While mixture representations deviated from those of their components, they still formed clusters of trajectories, well segregated from those corresponding to nonoverlapping mixtures. In Figure 5C, sets of all single- and mixed-odor trajectories for odors containing only components W, X, Y, and Z and those containing only components A, B, C, and D are plotted, revealing two nonoverlapping manifolds, seen as two clusters in inset (A and W). The qualitative results in Figures 5A–5C suggest that the representations of complex mixtures by PN assemblies are ordered: the more similar odors are, the more similar their corresponding representations. We tested this hypothesis directly by computing metrics in the full (not dimension-reduced) space. We first computed the dissimilarity between odor stimuli (represented as eight dimensional [8D] binary vectors whose coordinates indicate the presence or absence of each of the eight components) using the Jaccard distance (Deza and Deza, 2009Deza M. Deza E. Encyclopedia of Distances. Springer Verlag, Dordrecht2009Crossref Scopus (1334) Google Scholar). We computed all pairwise distances Dj between odors, and all correlation distances Dc between the PN population vectors corresponding to those odors (globally, i.e., formed by temporally concatenating the population vectors over the relevant time period). In Figure 5D, we plot the Spearman rank correlation between Dj and Dc calculated over the response (blue), over baseline (red), and a control (gray). During the response window, there is a strong tendency for trajectory distances to increase with odor distances (Figure S5A), while during baseline this trend is very weak. In Figure S5B, we show similar results using two other odor distance metrics. We conclude that the evolving odor representations by the PN population contain information about stimulus composition in their global intertrajectory distances. When observed bin by bin, distances between trajectories can vary: Figure 5E, for example, shows the evolution of Dc calculated for odors WYZ and DWYZ over time. But information about odor composition is preserved also in the intertrajectory distances measured instantaneously. Figure 5F shows the time course of the Spearman rank correlation (calculated as in Figure 5D) measured piecewise in time. Quickly followi"

A small-molecule inhibitor of the KRS-67LR interaction modulates the KRS-promoted metastatic potential of 67LR without disrupting the normal function of each protein. Lysyl-tRNA synthetase (KRS), a protein synthesis enzyme in the cytosol, relocates to the plasma membrane after a laminin signal and stabilizes a 67-kDa laminin receptor (67LR) that is implicated in cancer metastasis; however, its potential as an antimetastatic therapeutic target has not been explored. We found that the small compound BC-K-YH16899, which binds KRS, impinged on the interaction of KRS with 67LR and suppressed metastasis in three different mouse models. The compound inhibited the KRS-67LR interaction in two ways. First, it directly blocked the association between KRS and 67LR. Second, it suppressed the dynamic movement of the N-terminal extension of KRS and reduced membrane localization of KRS. However, it did not affect the catalytic activity of KRS. Our results suggest that specific modulation of a cancer-related KRS-67LR interaction may offer a way to control metastasis while avoiding the toxicities associated with inhibition of the normal functions of KRS."
https://openalex.org/W1976456987,"Primary hyperoxaluria type I (PH1) is a conformational disease which result in the loss of alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT) function. The study of AGT has important implications for protein folding and trafficking because PH1 mutants may cause protein aggregation and mitochondrial mistargeting. We herein describe a multidisciplinary study aimed to understand the molecular basis of protein aggregation and mistargeting in PH1 by studying twelve AGT variants. Expression studies in cell cultures reveal strong protein folding defects in PH1 causing mutants leading to enhanced aggregation, and in two cases, mitochondrial mistargeting. Immunoprecipitation studies in a cell-free system reveal that most mutants enhance the interactions with Hsc70 chaperones along their folding process, while in vitro binding experiments show no changes in the interaction of folded AGT dimers with the peroxisomal receptor Pex5p. Thermal denaturation studies by calorimetry support that PH1 causing mutants often kinetically destabilize the folded apo-protein through significant changes in the denaturation free energy barrier, whereas coenzyme binding overcomes this destabilization. Modeling of the mutations on a 1.9 Å crystal structure suggests that PH1 causing mutants perturb locally the native structure. Our work support that a misbalance between denaturation energetics and interactions with chaperones underlie aggregation and mistargeting in PH1, suggesting that native state stabilizers and protein homeostasis modulators are potential drugs to restore the complex and delicate balance of AGT protein homeostasis in PH1."

https://openalex.org/W2029455918,"The decrease in proline transport by the proline porter ProP in a ΔproQ strain has been well documented; however, the reason for this phenotype remains undefined. Previous studies have speculated that ProQ facilitates translation of proP mRNA. Here, we demonstrate that ProQ is enriched in the polysome fractions of sucrose gradient separations of E. coli lysates and the 30S fractions of lysates separated under conditions causing ribosomal subunit dissociation. Thus, ProQ is a bona fide ribosome associated protein. Analysis of proQ constructs lacking predicted structural domains implicates the N-terminal domain in ribosome association. Association with the ribosome appears to be mediated by an interaction with the mRNA being translated, as limited treatment of lysates with Micrococcal Nuclease maintains ribosome integrity but disrupts ProQ localization with polysomes. ProQ also fails to robustly bind to mRNA-free 70S ribosomes in vitro. Interestingly, deletion of proP does not disrupt the localization of ProQ with translating ribosomes, and deletion of proP in combination with the proU operon has no effect on ProQ localization. We also demonstrate that ProQ is necessary for robust biofilm formation, and this phenotype is independent of ProP. Binding studies were carried out using tryptophan fluorescence and in vitro transcribed proP mRNAs. proP is transcribed from two differentially regulated promoters, and ProQ interacts with proP mRNA transcribed from both promoters, as well as a control mRNA with similar affinities. In total, these data suggest that ProQ is positioned to function as a novel translational regulator, and its cellular role extends beyond its effects on proline uptake by ProP."

Methods The study population consisted of twenty one heterosexual couples (age: 22.6 ± 2.8 years old) from the Montreal region. Free living energy expenditure during sexual activity and the endurance exercise was measured using the portable mini SenseWear armband. Perceived energy expenditure, perception of effort, fatigue and pleasure were also assessed after sexual activity. All participants completed a 30 min endurance exercise session on a treadmill at a moderate intensity. Results Mean energy expenditure during sexual activity was 101 kCal or 4.2 kCal/min in men and 69.1 kCal or 3.1 kCal/min in women. In addition, mean intensity was 6.0 METS in men and 5.6 METS in women, which represents a moderate intensity. Moreover, the energy expenditure and intensity during the 30 min exercise session in men was 276 kCal or 9.2 kCal/min and 8.5 METS, respectively and in women 213 kCal or 7.1 kCal/min and 8.4 METS, respectively. Interestingly, the highest range value achieved by men for absolute energy expenditure can potentially be higher than that of the mean energy expenditure of the 30 min exercise session (i.e. 306.1 vs. 276 kCal, respectively) whereas this was not observed in women. Finally, perceived energy expenditure during sexual activity was similar in men (100 kCal) and in women (76.2 kCal) when compared to measured energy expenditure. Conclusion The present study indicates that energy expenditure during sexual activity appears to be approximately 85 kCal or 3.6 kCal/min and seems to be performed at a moderate intensity (5.8 METS) in young healthy men and women. These results suggest that sexual activity may potentially be considered, at times, as a significant exercise."
https://openalex.org/W2151972360,"Although intraerythrocytic ATP and 2,3-bisphophoglycerate (2,3-BPG) are known as direct indicators of the viability of preserved red blood cells and the efficiency of post-transfusion oxygen delivery, no current blood storage method in practical use has succeeded in maintaining both these metabolites at high levels for long periods. In this study, we constructed a mathematical kinetic model of comprehensive metabolism in red blood cells stored in a recently developed blood storage solution containing adenine and guanosine, which can maintain both ATP and 2,3-BPG. The predicted dynamics of metabolic intermediates in glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, and purine salvage pathway were consistent with time-series metabolome data measured with capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry over 5 weeks of storage. From the analysis of the simulation model, the metabolic roles and fates of the 2 major additives were illustrated: (1) adenine could enlarge the adenylate pool, which maintains constant ATP levels throughout the storage period and leads to production of metabolic waste, including hypoxanthine; (2) adenine also induces the consumption of ribose phosphates, which results in 2,3-BPG reduction, while (3) guanosine is converted to ribose phosphates, which can boost the activity of upper glycolysis and result in the efficient production of ATP and 2,3-BPG. This is the first attempt to clarify the underlying metabolic mechanism for maintaining levels of both ATP and 2,3-BPG in stored red blood cells with in silico analysis, as well as to analyze the trade-off and the interlock phenomena between the benefits and possible side effects of the storage-solution additives."
https://openalex.org/W2082853577,"Proper cell division is essential for growth and development of uni- and multicellular organisms. The fungal septation initiation network (SIN) functions as kinase cascade that connects cell cycle progression with the initiation of cytokinesis. Miss-regulation of the homologous Hippo pathway in animals results in excessive cell proliferation and formation of tumors, underscoring the conservation of both pathways. How SIN proteins interact and transmit signals through the cascade is only beginning to be understood. Moreover, our understanding of septum formation and its regulation in filamentous fungi, which represent the vast majority of the fungal kingdom, is highly fragmentary. We determined that a tripartite kinase cascade, consisting of CDC-7, SID-1 and DBF-2, together with their regulatory subunits CDC-14 and MOB-1, is important for septum formation in the model mold Neurospora crassa. DBF-2 activity and septum formation requires auto-phosphorylation at Ser499 within the activation segment and phosphorylation of Thr671 in the hydrophobic motif by SID-1. Moreover, SID-1-stimulated DBF-2 activity is further enhanced by CDC-7, supporting a stepwise activation mechanism of the tripartite SIN kinase cascade in fungi. However, in contrast to the situation described for unicellular yeasts, the localization of the entire SIN cascade to spindle pole bodies is constitutive and cell cycle independent. Moreover, all SIN proteins except CDC-7 form cortical rings prior to septum initiation and localize to constricting septa. Thus, SIN localization and activity regulation significantly differs in unicellular versus syncytial ascomycete fungi."
https://openalex.org/W2168603969,"Prion strains (or variants) are structurally distinct amyloid conformations arising from a single polypeptide sequence. The existence of prion strains has been well documented in mammalian prion diseases. In many cases, prion strains manifest as variation in disease progression and pathology, and in some cases, these prion strains also show distinct biochemical properties. Yet, the underlying basis of prion propagation and the extent of conformational possibilities available to amyloidogenic proteins remain largely undefined. Prion proteins in yeast that are also capable of maintaining multiple self-propagating structures have provided much insight into prion biology. Here, we explore the vast structural diversity of the yeast prion [RNQ+] in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We screened for the formation of [RNQ+] in vivo, allowing us to calculate the rate of spontaneous formation as ~2.96x10-6, and successfully isolate several different [RNQ+] variants. Through a comprehensive set of biochemical and biological analyses, we show that these prion variants are indeed novel. No individual property or set of properties, including aggregate stability and size, was sufficient to explain the physical basis and range of prion variants and their resulting cellular phenotypes. Furthermore, all of the [RNQ+] variants that we isolated were able to facilitate the de novo formation of the yeast prion [PSI+], an epigenetic determinant of translation termination. This supports the hypothesis that [RNQ+] acts as a functional amyloid in regulating the formation of [PSI+] to produce phenotypic diversity within a yeast population and promote adaptation. Collectively, this work shows the broad spectrum of available amyloid conformations, and thereby expands the foundation for studying the complex factors that interact to regulate the propagation of distinct aggregate structures."
https://openalex.org/W2161867781,"Engineered biomatrices offer the potential to recapitulate the regenerative microenvironment, with important implications in tissue repair. In this context, investigation of the molecular interactions occurring between growth factors, cytokines and extracellular matrix (ECM) has gained increasing interest. Here, we sought to investigate the possible interactions between the ECM proteins fibronectin (FN) and fibrinogen (Fg) with the CXCR3 ligands CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11, which are expressed during wound healing. New binding interactions were observed and characterized. Heparin-binding domains within Fg (residues 15-66 of the β chain, Fg β15-66) and FN (FNI1-5, but not FNIII12-14) were involved in binding to CXCL10 and CXCL11 but not CXCL9. To investigate a possible influence of FN and Fg interactions with CXCL11 in mediating its role during re-epithelialization, we investigated human keratinocyte migration in vitro and wound healing in vivo in diabetic db/db mice. A synergistic effect on CXCL11-induced keratinocyte migration was observed when cells were treated with CXCL11 in combination with FN in a transmigration assay. Moreover, wound healing was enhanced in full thickness excisional wounds treated with fibrin matrices functionalized with FN and containing CXCL11. These findings highlight the importance of the interactions occurring between cytokines and ECM and point to design concepts to develop functional matrices for regenerative medicine."
https://openalex.org/W1967194217,"In Mongolia, adequate early diagnosis and treatment of developmental hip dysplasia (DDH) have been unavailable and its incidence was unknown. We determined the incidence of ultrasonographic DDH in newborns and established adequate procedures for diagnosis and treatment of DDH at the largest maternity hospital in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.During one year (Sept 2010 - Aug 2011) we assessed the hips newborns using ultrasound and Graf's classification of DDH. 8,356 newborns were screened; median age at screening was 1 day. We identified 14,873 Type 1 (89.0%), 1715 Type 2a (10.3%), 36 Type 2c (0.2%), 70 Type D (0.4%), 14 Type 3 (0.08%), and 4 Type 4 hips (0.02%). Children with Type 1 hips (normal) were discharged. Children with Type 2a hips (physiologically immature) received follow-up ultrasounds at monthly intervals. Children with Type 2c to 4 (DDH; deformed or misaligned hip joint) hips were treated with a Tubingen hip flexion splint and also followed up. The hip abnormalities resolved to mature hips in all children who were followed up. There was no evidence for severe treatment related complications.This study suggests that the incidence of DDH in Mongolian neonates is comparable to that in neonates in Europe. Early ultrasound-based assessment and splinting treatment of DDH led to mature hips in all children followed up. Procedures are feasible and will be continued."
https://openalex.org/W2018440509,"The kinase DOUBLETIME is a master regulator of the Drosophila circadian clock, yet the mechanisms regulating its activity remain unclear. A proteomic analysis of DOUBLETIME interactors led to the identification of an unstudied protein designated CG17282. RNAi-mediated knockdown of CG17282 produced behavioral arrhythmicity and long periods and high levels of hypophosphorylated nuclear PERIOD and phosphorylated DOUBLETIME. Overexpression of DOUBLETIME in flies suppresses these phenotypes and overexpression of CG17282 in S2 cells enhances DOUBLETIME-dependent PERIOD degradation, indicating that CG17282 stimulates DOUBLETIME's circadian function. In photoreceptors, CG17282 accumulates rhythmically in PERIOD- and DOUBLETIME-dependent cytosolic foci. Finally, structural analyses demonstrated CG17282 is a noncanonical FK506-binding protein with an inactive peptide prolyl-isomerase domain that binds DOUBLETIME and tetratricopeptide repeats that may promote assembly of larger protein complexes. We have named CG17282 BRIDE OF DOUBLETIME and established it as a mediator of DOUBLETIME's effects on PERIOD, most likely in cytosolic foci that regulate PERIOD nuclear accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W1964718671,"Parasitized individuals are often expected to be poor competitors because they are weakened by infections. Many trematode species, however, although extensively exploiting their mollusc hosts, also induce gigantism (increased host size) by diverting host resources towards growth instead of reproduction. In such systems, alternatively to reduced competitive ability due to negative effects of parasitism on host performance, larger size could allow more efficient resource acquisition and thus increase the relative competitive ability of host individuals. We addressed this hypothesis by testing the effect of a trematode parasite Diplostomum pseudospathaceum on the competitive ability of its snail host Lymnaea stagnalis. We experimentally examined the growth of snails kept in pairs in relation to their infection status and intensity of resource competition (i.e. food availability). We found that parasitized snails grew faster and their reproduction was reduced compared to unparasitized individuals indicating parasite-induced gigantism. However, growth of the snails was faster when competing with parasitized individuals compared to unparasitized snails indicating reduced competitive ability due to parasitism. The latter effect, however, was relatively weak suggesting that the effects of the parasite on snail physiology may partly override each other in determining competitive ability."
https://openalex.org/W2045276278,"Major salivary gland tumours are uncommon neoplasms of the head and neck. The increase of precise pre-operative diagnosis is crucial for their correct management and the identification of molecular markers would surely improve the required accuracy. In this study we performed a comparative proteomic analysis of fine needle aspiration fluids of the most frequent benign neoplasms of major salivary glands, namely pleomorphic adenoma and Warthin's tumour, in order to draw their proteomic profiles and to point out their significant features. Thirty-five patients submitted to parotidectomy were included in the study, 22 were identified to have pleomorphic adenoma and 14 Warthin's tumour. Fine needle aspiration samples were processed using a two-dimensional electrophoresis/mass spectrometry-based approach. A total of 26 differentially expressed proteins were identified. Ingenuity software was used to search the biological processes to which these proteins belong and to construct potential networks. Intriguingly, all Warthin's tumour up-regulated proteins such as Ig gamma-1 chain C region, Ig kappa chain C region and Ig alpha-1 chain C region and S100A9 were correlated to immunological and inflammatory diseases, while pleomorphic adenomas such as annexin A1, annexin A4, macrophage-capping protein, apolipoprotein E and alpha crystalline B chain were associated with cell death, apoptosis and tumorigenesis, showing different features of two benign tumours. Overall, our results shed new light on the potential usefulness of a proteomic approach to study parotid tumours and in particular up regulated proteins are able to discriminate two types of benign parotid lesions."
https://openalex.org/W2006190666,"The formation of many nebkha dunes relies on the layering of clonal plants. The microenvironmental conditions of such phytogenic nebkha are heterogeneous depending on the aspect and slope. Exploring the effects of aspect on clonal reproduction and biomass allocation can be useful in understanding the ecological adaptation of species. We hypothesized that on the windward side layering propagation would be promoted, that biomass allocation to leaves and stems of ramets would increase, and that the effects of aspect would be greater in the layering with larger biomass. To test these hypotheses, we surveyed the depth of germination points of axillary buds, the rate of ramet sprouting, the density of adventitious root formation points, and the biomass of modules sprouting from layering located on the NE, SE, SW and NW, aspects of Nitraria tangutorum nebkhas. The windward side was located on the NW and SW aspects. The results indicated that conditions of the NW aspect were more conducive to clonal reproduction and had the highest rate of ramet sprouting and the highest density of adventitious formation points. For the modules sprouting from layering on the SW aspect, biomass allocation to leaves and stems was greatest with biomass allocation to adventitious roots being lowest. This result supported our hypothesis. Contrary to our hypothesis, the effects of aspect were greater in layering of smaller biomass. These results support the hypothesis that aspect does affect layering propagation capacity and biomass allocation in this species. Additionally, clonal reproduction and biomass allocation of modules sprouting from layering with smaller biomass was more affected by aspect. These results suggest that the clonal growth of N. tangutorum responses to the microenvironmental heterogeneity that results from aspect of the nebkha."
https://openalex.org/W1981842543,"Arabidopsis thaliana MERISTEM LAYER 1 (ATML1), an HD-ZIP class IV homeobox gene, is one of the key regulators promoting epidermal cell differentiation in Arabidopsis thaliana. We recently showed that ATML1 was able to confer an ectopic shoot epidermis cell fate to non-epidermal tissues of seedlings, suggesting that ATML1 is a master regulator of epidermal cell fate. To further assess the roles of ATML1 and its homologs in epidermal cell differentiation, I generated transgenic plants expressing ATML1 fused with a transcriptional repressor sequence (ATML1-SRDX). Estradiol-induced expression of ATML1-SRDX in the seedlings decreased transcript levels of several epidermis-related genes. Moreover, these transgenic plants exhibited phenotypes such as increased permeability to a hydrophilic dye and fusion of leaves and cotyledons, which are reminiscent of epidermis and/or cuticle-deficient mutants. Epidermal cell morphology was severely affected in the strong lines: filamentous protrusions were formed on the surface of the cotyledons. Marker gene analyses showed that these protrusions did not have epidermis, mesophyll, root hair, or trichome cell identity, suggesting that post-embryonic expression of ATML1-SRDX was sufficient to alter cell identity in pre-existing protodermal cells of the cotyledons. Taken together, these results suggest that ATML1 and/or its target genes are not only necessary for the initial specification of epidermal cell fate but also may be necessary for the maintenance of epidermal cells in later stages."
https://openalex.org/W1988724122,"Recently, most foodborne illness outbreaks of salmonellosis have been caused by consumption of contaminated fresh produce. Yet, the mechanisms that allow the human pathogen Salmonella enterica to contaminate and grow in plant environments remain poorly described. We examined the effect of feeding by phytophagous insects on survival of S. enterica on lettuce. Larger S. enterica populations were found on leaves infested with Macrosteles quadrilineatus. In contrast, pathogen populations among plants exposed to Frankliniella occidentalis or Myzus persicae were similar to those without insects. However, on plants infested with F. occidentalis, areas of the infested leaf with feeding damage sustained higher S. enterica populations than areas without damage. The spatial distribution of S. enterica cells on leaves infested with F. occidentalis may be altered resulting in higher populations in feeding lesions or survival may be different across a leaf dependent on local damage. Results suggest the possibility of some specificity with select insects and the persistence of S. enterica. Additionally, we demonstrated the potential for phytophagous insects to become contaminated with S. enterica from contaminated plant material. S. enterica was detected in approximately 50% of all M. quadrilineatus, F. occidentalis, and M. persicae after 24 h exposure to contaminated leaves. Particularly, 17% of F. occidentalis, the smallest of the insects tested, harbored more than 10(2) CFU/F. occidentalis. Our results show that phytophagous insects may influence the population dynamics of S. enterica in agricultural crops. This study provides evidence of a human bacterial pathogen interacting with phytophagous insect during plant infestation."
https://openalex.org/W2052664773,"The post genomic era revealed the need for developing better performing, easier to use and more sophisticated genetic manipulation tools for the study of Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease. In this work a series of plasmids that allow genetic manipulation of this protozoan parasite were developed. First of all we focused on useful tools to establish selection strategies for different strains and which can be employed as expression vectors. On the other hand molecular building blocks in the form of diverse selectable markers, modifiable fluorescent protein and epitope-tag coding sequences were produced. Both types of modules were harboured in backbone molecules conceived to offer multiple construction and sub-cloning strategies. These can be used to confer new properties to already available genetic manipulation tools or as starting points for whole novel designs. The performance of each plasmid and building block was determined independently. For illustration purposes, some simple direct practical applications were conducted."
