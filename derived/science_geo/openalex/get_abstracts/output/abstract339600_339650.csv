https://openalex.org/W1978932116,"The room temperature dynamics of single sulforhodamine 101 molecules dispersed on a glass surface are investigated on two different time scales with near-field optics. On the 10(-2)- to 10(2)-second time scale, intensity fluctuations in the emission from single molecules are examined with polarization measurements, providing insight into their spectroscopic properties. On the nanosecond time scale, the fluorescence lifetimes of single molecules are measured, and their excited-state energy transfer to the aluminum coating of the near-field probe is characterized. A movie of the time-resolved emission demonstrates the feasibility of fluorescence lifetime imaging with single molecule sensitivity, picosecond temporal resolution, and a spatial resolving power beyond the diffraction limit."
https://openalex.org/W4246249939,"Sequential adsorption of a cationic polyelectrolyte and individual sheets of the silicate mineral hectorite has allowed controlled, stepwise formation of multilayered films on silicon wafers. Each component adsorbs rapidly by an ion-exchange mechanism, and x-ray diffractometry indicates structural order even in films with thicknesses greater than 0.2 micrometer. The large lateral extent of the silicate sheets (about 25 to 35 nanometers) allows each layer to cover any packing defects in the underlying layer, thus preserving structural order in the growing film. With careful choice of component materials, this method should allow for the preparation of multilayered films with a variety of technologically important properties."

High-pressure x-ray diffraction and optical absorption are used to study the wurtzite to rock salt structural transformation in CdSe nanocrystals. These experiments show that both the thermodynamics and kinetics of this transformation are altered in finite size, as compared to bulk CdSe. An explanation of these results in the context of transformations in bulk systems is presented. Insight into the kinetics of transformations in both bulk and nanocrystal systems can be gained."
https://openalex.org/W1983312070,"Fluorescence lifetimes of single Rhodamine 6G molecules on silica surfaces were measured with pulsed laser excitation, time-correlated single photon counting, and near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM). The fluorescence lifetime varies with the position of a molecule relative to a near-field probe. Qualitative features of lifetime decreases are consistent with molecular excited state quenching effects near metal surfaces. The technique of NSOM provides a means of altering the environment of a single fluorescent molecule and its decay kinetics in a repeatable fashion."
https://openalex.org/W2075839910,"Toward an electronic level understanding of intergranular embrittlement and its control in steels, the effects of phosphorus and boron impurities on the energy and electronic properties of both an iron grain boundary and its corresponding intergranular fracture surface are investigated by the local density full potential augmented plane wave method. When structural relaxations are taken into account, the calculated energy difference of phosphorus in the two environments is consistent with its measured embrittlement potency. In contrast to the nonhybridized interaction of iron and phosphorus, iron-boron hybridization permits covalent bonding normal to the boundary contributing to cohesion enhancement. Insights into bonding behavior offer the potential for new directions in alloy composition for improvement of grain boundary-sensitive properties."

The catalytic reactions between polyfluorobenzenes and hydrosilanes result in substitution of fluorine atoms by hydrogen atoms and are chemo- and regioselective. With individual stoichiometric steps observed and combined, and with intermediates isolated and fully characterized (including crystal structures), these systems demonstrate the effectiveness of a rational approach to catalytic design."
https://openalex.org/W2005586189,"Observations and modeling of 3- to 6-hertz seismic shear waves trapped within the fault zone of the 1992 Landers earthquake series allow the fine structure and continuity of the zone to be evaluated. The fault, to a depth of at least 12 kilometers, is marked by a zone 100 to 200 meters wide where shear velocity is reduced by 30 to 50 percent. This zone forms a seismic waveguide that extends along the southern 30 kilometers of the Landers rupture surface and ends at the fault bend about 18 kilometers north of the main shock epicenter. Another fault plane waveguide, disconnected from the first, exists along the northern rupture surface. These observations, in conjunction with surface slip, detailed seismicity patterns, and the progression of rupture along the fault, suggest that several simple rupture planes were involved in the Landers earthquake and that the inferred rupture front hesitated or slowed at the location where the rupture jumped from one to the next plane. Reduction in rupture velocity can tentatively be attributed to fault plane complexity, and variations in moment release can be attributed to variations in available energy."

Here, atomic force microscopy and field emission scanning electron microscopy reveal the structure of the nematocyst capsule wall. The outer wall consists of globular proteins of unknown function. The inner wall consists of bundles of collagen-like fibrils having a spacing of 50 to 100 nanometers and cross-striations at intervals of 32 nanometers. The fibrils consist of polymers of ""mini-collagens,"" which are abundant in the nematocysts of Hydra. The distinct pattern of mini-collagen fibers in the inner wall can provide the tensile strength necessary to withstand the high osmotic pressure (15 megapascals) in the capsules."
https://openalex.org/W2022604420,"A cuprate superconductor containing double mercury layers was synthesized with a high-pressure, high-temperature technique. The compound, with chemical formula Hg(2)Ba(2)-Y1-xCaxCu(2)O(8-delta), contains a double HgO layer with structure similar to that of rock salt. The prototype compound Hg(2)Ba(2)YCu(2)O(8-delta) is an insulator. Superconductivity is induced in the system by partially replacing yttrium with calcium."

work of Harry J. Deuel, Jr. [ Science 124 , 209 (3
Aug. 1956)], J. Murray Luck wrote that Deuel
was struggling to finish the third and final volume

C. Deuel informs us that Deuel did in fact complete the third volume of The Lipides before his
last illness and that the volume is scheduled for
publication early in 1957."
