https://openalex.org/W2044634714,"Fermentation of food by the microbial community of the rumen is essential for the maintenance and growth of ruminants. The microbial ecosystem and its interaction with the host are described, along with recent attempts to manipulate the composition and activity of the microbial community by adding antibiotics and other chemicals to ruminant diets. A similar microbial community and fermentation occur in the large intestine or cecum of most nonruminant animals including the large intestine of humans. The microbial ecosystems of the rumen and human large intestine are compared."
https://openalex.org/W1532113135,We demonstrate a highly significant relationship (p less than 0.0001) between the incorporation of 5-flourouracil in total cellular RNA and loss of clonogenic survival of the human MCF-7 breast carcinoma cell line. The extent of 5-fluorouracil incorporation in RNA is concentration- and time-dependent. Identical results are obtained in experiments employing thymidine to bypass the block of thymidylate synthetase and reverse inhibition of DNA synthesis. These studies suggest that the incorporation of 5-fluorouracil in RNA is the major mechanism of cytotoxic action in this human cell line.
https://openalex.org/W1968162053,"Liposome-encapsulated drugs and fluorescent markers have been proposed as useful tools in studies of cell biology and in chemotherapy1–3. Until recently, this approach has been limited by the lack of means to fix protein ligands, such as antibodies, to liposome surfaces where they can mediate specific interactions with cells. Our newly developed technique4 for the covalent coupling of monoclonal antibodies to small, sonicated liposomes was used to study the specific delivery of methotrexate (MTX) to cellular targets in vitro. Liposomes containing MTX and carboxyfluorescein (CF)5–7 were coupled to monoclonal antibodies against determinants of molecules encoded by the major histocompatibility complex of the murine H–2k haplotype. These were incubated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced blast cells from CBA (H–2k), or C57BL/6 (B6) (H–2b) spleens. Only spleen cells from the CBA strain showed evidence of drug effect, as indicated by inhibition of radiolabelled deoxyuridine incorporation, demonstrating that the interaction of the liposomes with the cells was specific. With regard to the different determinants, the effect of the liposome-encapsulated MTX was not correlated with the number of liposomes bound to cells. More lipsomes became bound to the H–2Kk molecule than to the H–2 I–Ek molecule, but liposomes bound to the latter were more effective for drug delivery. An endocytic pathway for the liposome-encapsulated drug is suggested by the fact that the effect of the drug in liposomes, but not in free form, was inhibited by the lysosomotropic amine, NH4CI. The techniques described here provide a simple quantitative assay for the ‘endocytic potential’ of any cell-surface determinant for which a ligand, such as an antibody or hormone, is available."
https://openalex.org/W2094485880,"Surviving persons from a kindred in which retinoblastoma occurred over four generations, transmitted by eight unaffected individuals, underwent chromosomal analysis. The results revealed that the development of retinoblastoma was associated with a constitutional chromosome deletion del(13)(q13.1q14.5) and that the unaffected transmitting state was associated with a balanced insertional translocation. These findings indicate that predisposition to retinoblastoma may be attributed to the loss of specific genetic material and that a chromosomal mechanism may explain apparent lack of gene penetrance in certain families. The development of unilateral, and not bilateral, retinoblastoma suggests either that the chromosome deletion is different from the mutation of heritable retinoblastoma in general, or that the chromosome deletion lessens the probability of subsequent somatic carcinogenic events."

Many of the essential steps now have high rates of success, including the recovery of preovulatory oocytes, and fertilization and embryo cleavage in vitro. Implantation of the embryo following its replacement in the mother remains the major difficulty. Some implications of the work are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1587472377,"Abstract Pig kidney general acyl-CoA dehydrogenase is irreversibly inactivated by methylenecyclopropylacetyl-CoA, a metabolite of the hypoglycemic amino acid hypoglycin from Blighia sapida, to less that 2% of native activity. Octanoyl-CoA affords strong protection against this inhibition. During inactivation, about 80% of the enzyme FAD is covalently and irreversibly modified with the residual inhibition possibly resulting from modification of the protein. Denaturation of the inactivated enzyme yields several modified flavin derivatives in addition to about 20% unmodified FAD. From spectral comparison, the structure of one of these species is tentatively assigned to a derivative of 4a,5-dihydroflavin, while two further products resemble 6-, and 8-substituted flavins. These results suggest that methylenecyclopropylacetyl-CoA (and consequently the methylenecyclopropylmethano moiety of hypoglycin) be considered suicide substrates."

Progesterone acts selectively on the occupied form of the nuclear estrogen receptor, with no effect on the concentration of an unoccupied form. This observation indicates that progesterone modulates the action of estrogen by controlling nuclear retention of the estrogen-receptor complex."

https://openalex.org/W1510966084,"Since there exists some controversy in the literature as to whether paraquat augments microsomal lipid peroxidation via superoxide anion (O2-), the role of paraquat and active oxygen species in NADPH-dependent lung microsomal lipid peroxidation was investigated. Incubation of buffered aerobic mixture of bovine lung microsome and NADPH, in the presence or absence of exogenously added iron, resulted in a progressive formation of lipid peroxides whose accumulation could be followed at 535 nm as malondialdehyde. Paraquat strongly inhibited this lipid peroxidation. Thus, malondialdehyde formation was 50% inhibited by 4 X 10(-5) M paraquat in the reaction mixture. The malondialdehyde color development by lipid peroxides was not affected by this concentration of paraquat. Lipid peroxidation was also strongly inhibited by singlet oxygen scavengers, e.g. dimethylfuran and diphenylfuran, and by catalase. Hydroxyl radical scavengers, e.g. mannitol, benzoate, and ethanol, had little effect in malondialdehyde production. Superoxide dismutase, which removes O2- efficiently, did not inhibit malondialdehyde production by lung microsomes and rather enhanced its formation. A scheme in which paraquat and active O2 species may be involved with microsomal lipid peroxidation is presented."

https://openalex.org/W1508048429,"Further studies on human milk bile salt-activated lipase were performed to provide kinetic and additional chemical characterizations of this enzyme. The enzyme was homogeneous by urea-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing with an isoelectric point of 3.7. A unique feature of the amino acid composition of this enzyme was a high proline content (13 mol %). Results of carbohydrate analyses indicated that the enzyme was a glycoprotein containing fucose, galactose, glucosamine, galactosamine, and sialic acid. Kinetic studies were performed with various water-soluble esters (p-nitrophenyl acetate, 1-monoacetin, 1-monobutyrin, and 1-monocaprylin) as substrate and taurocholate as activator. In the presence of a saturating level of taurocholate, the enzyme reaction was demonstrated to follow a rapid equilibrium random uni bi mechanism. Also, these kinetic studies indicated the formation of an enzyme-activator-substrate ternary complex through a random pathway. The mechanism of the activation by taurocholate was due to its enhancement of the binding of the enzyme to the substrate (6.2-fold) and its enhancement of the rate of conversion from enzyme-substrate transitory complex to the products (1.57-fold) when examined with p-nitrophenyl acetate as substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1558382061,"Exposure of rat hepatoma tissue culture cells to dexamethasone results in appearance of a new glycoprotein, gp35-50 (Mr = 35,000 to 50,000) and increased synthesis of another glycoprotein, gp50 (Mr = 50,000). The glycoproteins synthesized in a fractionated cell-free translation system (containing dog pancreas microsomes) appear as a well separated series of spots on two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels which differ in size and charge. Glycoproteins synthesized by glucose-starved cells show similar size and charge heterogeneity. The size heterogeneity consists of a series of spots, each differing in molecular weights by about 3,000, which could be almost completely abolished by treatment with endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H. Our results indicate that unglycosylated gp50 (Mr = 42,000) typically acquires 3 N-glycan units, whereas gp35-50 (Mr = 22,000) possesses eight N-glycosylation sites. Analysis of the cell-free translation products directed by mRNA from hepatoma tissue culture cells grown in tissue culture, from hepatoma tissue, and from normal liver tissue indicated that administration of dexamethasone causes a pronounced increase in gp35-50 mRNA in all three tissues. A similar increase was observed in liver after inflammation which along with other biochemical properties suggests that gp35-50 may be alpha 1-acid protein. In contrast, mRNA coding for gp50 was not increased by dexamethasone in tumor tissue and no protein structurally related to gp50 was detected in the liver mRNA translation products. Thus, gp35-50 is expressed in normal liver, whereas gp50 is expressed in hepatoma cells and is differentially regulated by steroid hormones depending on whether the cells are grown in tissue culture or as a tumor in the rat."
https://openalex.org/W1588267638,"It has recently been demonstrated that an established cell line from pig kidney, LLC-PK1, is a useful model for the study of vasopressin-sensitive adenylate cyclase (Roy, C., and Ausiello, D. A. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 3415-3422; Roy, C., Hall, D., Karish, M., and Ausiello, D. A. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 3423-3427). The present study on the regulation of this enzyme has led to the demonstration of the modulation of vasopressin-stimulated adenylate cyclase by Ca2+-calmodulin. The characteristics of calmodulin regulation were similar to those described for other enzymes: (a) activation required micromolar quantities of free Ca2+; (b) maximal enzyme rates were altered but not the Km for hormone activation; (c) activity was inhibitable by trifluoperazine; and (d) activation was dependent on the Mg2+ concentration. These findings should help to define the mechanisms of action of several agents known to alter vasopressin-sensitive adenylate cyclase and cell Ca2+ content."

https://openalex.org/W1544572661,"The small ribosomal subunit from rabbit reticulocytes was allowed to react with 2-iminothiolane under conditions that minimize the formation of 40 S subunit dimers. Reaction with 2-iminothiolane results in the formation of amidine-linked sulfhydryl derivatives of protein amino groups. Cross-linking between proximal sulfhydryl groups was promoted by mild oxidation of the modified ribosomal subunits. Protein extracted from cross-linked ribosomes was fractionated on the basis of charge by polyacrylamide-urea gel electrophoresis at pH 5.5. Cross-linked protein dimers in sequential slices of this gel were analyzed by diagonal polyacrylamide-sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. Constituent proteins of cross-linked pairs were located by their common mobility in the first dimension and by comparison of the sum of their molecular weights with that of the parent cross-linked species. They were unambiguously identified by extraction, radioiodination, two-dimensional polyacrylamide-urea gel electrophoresis and radioautography and comparison with nonradioactive markers. Thirty-six protein dimers were identified. Many proteins were found to occur in several cross-linked dimers and this facilitated representation of the results in a model showing the network of crosslinks. The results are discussed in relation to other structural and functional data on the 40 S ribosomal subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1548407034,"Abstract Dinucleosomes purified from micrococcal nuclease digests of steer kidney nuclei were stripped of H1 histone by exposure to 0.50 M NaCl. They were then formed in a complex with individual subfractions of calf thymus H1 histone by dialysis of histone-dinucleosome mixtures from 0.50 M NaCl to concentrations of NaCl between 0 M and 0.08 M; between 0.30 M and 0.10 M the complexes precipitated, and so were not included in the study. The presence of H1 in the complexes was shown to cause an asymmetrical, ordered condensation as revealed by distortions of the circular dichroic spectrum of the DNA. The distortions were negligible at 0.04 M NaCl and below, and increased as a function of ionic strength between 0.05 M and 0.08 M. The degree of distortion of the spectrum, and therefore the nature of dinucleosome condensation, differed greatly from one H1 subfraction to the next. One of the three subfractions tested had almost no effect on the circular dichroism in comparing its dinucleosome complex to H1-depleted dinucleosomes. The other subfractions to different degrees produced large distortions that resulted in spectra that were of the psi type at the higher salt concentration."

https://openalex.org/W1845114429,"At pH > 7.5 cells of Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, when synthesizing CH4 from COZ and Hz, are interior acid with respect to the buffer. If the buffer pH is lowered below pH 6.5 with HC1, the pH gradient has the usual orientation, i.e. the cells become interior alkaline. As measured with the lipophilic anion, thiocyanate, the cells did not generate a measurable electrical potential (4). Flow dialysis experiments carried out at pH > 7.5 with permeant base methylamine indicated that these cells establish an inverse pH gradient, ie., interior acid of +145 mV. With pH > 7.5 the polarity of the protonmotive force, @H+, across the cytoplasmic membrane therefore is reversed and would not serve to generate cellular ATP. Results with different uncoupling reagents suggest that in M. thermoautotrophicum the synthesis of ATP and CH, is carried out by intracellular vesicles and that the cytoplasmic membrane probably is not the site of energy transduction. Chloroform or 2,4-dinitrophenol are powerful inhibitors of both CH4 and ATP synthesis in these cells but, when used alone, do not discharge the pH gradient. Carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, on the other hand, partially dissipates the pH gradient and at low concentrations partially inhibits CHs or ATP synthesis. Chloroform or 2,4-dinitrophenol, when added after carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, gives an additional and significant release of acid from these cells and thereby completes the discharge of the pH gradient."

https://openalex.org/W1517087983,"Carbon 13 NMR data were obtained at four magnetic fields for double-stranded DNA samples 120 and 160 nucleotide pairs long. Spectral linewidths are several-fold smaller than predicted for overall rigid rod rotation and increase with increasing field, indicating significant chemical shift dispersion contributions to high field linewidths. Spin-lattice relaxation times are short (e.g. T1 values for CH carbon atoms are approximately 0.5 s at 67.9 MHz), and increase with increasing field. Nuclear Overhauser effects of 0.6 to 0.8 (theoretical maximum = 2.0) were measured for the same protonated carbon atoms at 100.6 MHz. These short T1 values nd relatively large nuclear Overhauser effects show that double-stranded DNA undergoes rapid internal motions with effective correlation times of a few nanoseconds. Preliminary data indicate that DNA base carbon motions occur on essentially the same time scale as sugar motions, thus arguing against independent flexibility of the DNA backbone. Linewidths decreased 2- to 5-fold and nuclear Overhauser effects doubled, upon heat denaturation of DNA, as expected for increased motion. On the other hand, NT1 values of native and denatured DNA were nearly identical, suggesting insensitivity of spin-lattice relaxation times to motions in the nanosecond range in these relatively stiff chains."
https://openalex.org/W1493778302,"The resonance Raman spectra of ferredoxins (Fd) I and II from Desulfovibrio gigas are reported using 4579 A Ar+ laser excitation. The (3Fe-3S) center in Fd II has a characteristic resonance Raman spectrum, readily distinguishable from those of (2Fe-2S) or (4Fe-4S) clusters. Reduction of Fd II produces a marked alteration in the resonance Raman spectrum. Fd I is shown to contain both (3Fe-3S) and (4Fe-4S) Fd-type clusters. The results illustrate the potential of resonance Raman spectroscopy in Fe-S cluster identification, even in cases where more than one cluster type is present."

https://openalex.org/W1508135395,"Bacillus stearothermophilus 50 S ribosomal subunits active in polyphenylalanine (polyPhe) synthesis were reconstituted from a mixture of purified proteins and RNA. Proteins were omitted one at a time, and the resulting particles were examined by sucrose gradient sedimentation and assayed for polyPhe synthesis, peptidyltransferase activity, and in some cases binding of elongation factor EF-G and GTP, and association with a (20 S . Phe-tRNA . poly(U)) complex. Based on their effect on polyPhe synthesis and peptidyltransferase activity, the proteins were grouped into four functional categories. The set of proteins most strongly required for peptidyltransferase activity, which must include the protein or proteins most directly involved in the active center, consists of proteins (probable Escherichia coli homologs in parentheses) B-L3 (E-L2), B-L4 (E-L4), B-L5 (E-L5), B-L6 (E-L3 or E-L6), B-L18 (E-L14), B-L20b (E-L16), and B-L25 (E-L20). Several proteins affected both polyPhe synthesis and peptidyltransferase activity more weakly. Only four proteins were required for polyPhe synthesis but not for peptidyltransferase activity, B-L2 (E-L1), B-L8 (E-L10), B-L13 (E-L7/L12), and B-L11(E-L11). The results indicate that the peptidyltransferase center is tightly integrated into the cooperative body of the 50 S subunit and that the (B-L8 . B-L13) complex is relatively independent of this cooperative domain."
https://openalex.org/W2000515843,"Labeled acetylcholine derived from labeled pyruvate in a synaptosomal preparation from rat brain, incubated with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide as well as coenzyme A, is stimulated by calcium ions in the absence but not in the presence of Triton X-100. Whereas citrate is taken up by cholinergic synaptosomes because it suppresses the formation of acetylcholine from pyruvate, it is not itself converted into acetylcholine. The evidence suggests that there is a calcium-dependent transfer of mitochondrial acetyl coenzyme A into the cholinergic synaptoplasm, which is apparently devoid of the citrate cleavage enzyme, and is there converted into acetylcholine. The permeability of the inner mitochondrial membrane to coenzyme A and acetyl coenzyme A seems to be enhanced by calcium ions, and this effect may be mediated by mitochondrial phospholipase A2."

https://openalex.org/W1604365183,"The monoazide derivative of ethidium, the parent compound of which is an anisotropic inhibitor of energy transduction in oxidative phosphorylation, was synthesized and shown to be useful as a photoaffinity probe. Results showed that monoazide ethidium specifically binds to a hydrophobic protein of mitochondria (with an apparent molecular weight of about 6200 in the presence of 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate). The molar binding ratios of monoazide ethidium to protein were about 5 and 17 with protein in the nonenergized and energized states, respectively. This protein differed from the dicyclohexylcarbodiimide-binding protein. We refer to this new hydrophobic protein, anisotropic inhibitor-binding protein, in this paper."

https://openalex.org/W1495410788,"The specific chemical modification by N-ethylmaleimide of a cysteine residue at pH 5.0 in porcine heart mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (L-malate:NAD+ oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.37) has been shown to result in an enzymatically inactive, monomeric product, which does not reassociate at pH 7.5 to yield the native dimer. In this report, an investigation of proton release and uptake upon NADH binding to the native enzyme and to the N-ethylmaleimide-modified enzyme has implicated the above cysteine residue as being directly linked to the pH-dependent subunit dissociation of mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase. The results are consistent with the view that the modified cysteine residue is not located at the subunit interaction site, although it is probably near this site. A recent study from this laboratory has demonstrated that the monomeric enzyme obtained at pH 5.0 exists in a conformation which is enzymatically inactive and which has an enhanced intrinsic protein fluorescence. Interpretation of protein fluorescence data has suggested that the N-ethylmaleimide modification results in inactivation of the enzyme by preventing the pH-induced conformational change to the active dimer. However, NADH is able to induce reassociation of the N-ethylmaleimide-modified enzyme at pH 7.5 but not at pH 5.0. This reassociation at pH 7.5 is accompanied by a significant regain of enzymatic activity, indicating that NADH binding is able to partially overcome the negative effect of the cysteine modification on the pH-dependent subunit reassociation of mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase."

The labeled protein was extensively reduced and alkylated and digested with pronase, and peptides were purified by gel filtration chromatography, anion and cation exchange chromatography, and high pressure liquid chromatography. Purified peptides were detected by their radioactivity, UV spectral properties, and by their fluorescence after reaction with fluorescamine.
