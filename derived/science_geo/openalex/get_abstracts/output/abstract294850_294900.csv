https://openalex.org/W2007939074,"Magnetic field measurements from the Ulysses space mission over the south polar regions of the sun showed that the structure and properties of the three-dimensional heliosphere were determined by the fast solar wind flow and magnetic fields from the large coronal holes in the polar regions of the sun. This conclusion applies at the current, minimum phase of the 11-year solar activity cycle. Unexpectedly, the radial component of the magnetic field was independent of latitude. The high-latitude magnetic field deviated significantly from the expected Parker geometry, probably because of large amplitude transverse fluctuations. Low-frequency fluctuations had a high level of variance. The rate of occurrence of discontinuities also increased significantly at high latitudes."
https://openalex.org/W2009979869,"Solar wind plasma observations made by the Ulysses spacecraft through -80.2 degrees solar latitude and continuing equatorward to -40.1 degrees are summarized. Recurrent high-speed streams and corotating interaction regions dominated at middle latitudes. The speed of the solar wind was typically 700 to 800 kilometers per second poleward of -35 degrees . Corotating reverse shocks persisted farther south than did forward shocks because of the tilt of the heliomagnetic streamer belt. Sporadic coronal mass ejections were seen as far south as -60.5 degrees . Proton temperature was higher and the electron strahl was broader at higher latitudes. The high-latitude wind contained compressional, pressure-balanced, and Alfvénic structures."

Electric vehicle technology also can move emissions to less crowd and less polluted locations. However, some other problems remain. The authors focus on the environmental consequences of producing and reprocessing large quantities of batteries to power electric cars, including discussions of both characteristics of Electric Vehicles and batteries and the life cycle of lead and the problems of environmental releases. The authors conclude that electric vehicles will not be in the public interest until they pose no greater threat to public health and the environment than do alternative technologies such as vehicles using low-emission gasoline. 19 refs., 1 tab."
https://openalex.org/W1973145833,"In 1990 Congress passed the Clean Air Act Ammendments, many parts of which deal with motor vehicles. Motor vehicles are the primary source of urban carbon monoxide and are an important source of hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen responsible for the formation of photochemical smog and ground-level ozone. Cost estimates for implementing the Acts`s mobil source provisions range up to $12 billion annually. Because of the huge economic cost affecting a ubiquitous transportation method, the authors analyse the scientific basis for the legistation programs. Their work is described here. They conclude that regulatory policies based on a computer model that targets all vehicles equally, with out recognizing the overriding importance of individual maintenance, may not be cost-effective or may be ineffective. 23 refs., 1 fig., 1 tab."
https://openalex.org/W2049610297,"Three-dimensional simulations of the heliospheric modulation of galactic cosmic ray protons show that corotating variations in the intensity can persist to quite high heliographic latitudes. Variations are seen at latitudes considerably higher than the maximum latitude extension of the heliographic current sheet, in regions where the solar wind velocity and magnetic field show no significant variation. Similar conclusions may apply also to lower energy particles, which may be accelerated at lower latitudes. Cosmic ray variations caused by corotating interaction regions present at low heliographic latitudes can propagate to significantly higher latitudes."
https://openalex.org/W2025471197,"Observations of galactic cosmic radiation and anomalous component nuclei with charged particle sensors on the Ulysses spacecraft showed that heliospheric magnetic field structure over the south solar pole does not permit substantially more direct access to the local interstellar cosmic ray spectrum than is possible in the equatorial zone. Fluxes of galactic cosmic rays and the anomalous component increased as a result of latitude gradients by less than 50% from the equator to -80°. Thus, the modulated cosmic ray nucleon, electron, and anomalous component fluxes are nearly spherically symmetric in the inner solar system. The cosmic rays and the anomalous nuclear component underwent a continuous, ∼26 day recurrent modulation to -80.2°, whereas all recurring magnetic field compressions and recurring streams in the solar wind disappeared above ∼55°S latitude."
https://openalex.org/W2013389940,"Along Ulysses' path from Jupiter to the south ecliptic pole, the onboard dust detector measured a dust impact rate that varied slowly from 0.2 to 0.5 impacts per day. The dominant component of the dust flux arrived from an ecliptic latitude and longitude of 100 + 10 degrees and 280 degrees +/- 30 degrees which indicates an interstellar origin. An additional flux of small particles, which do not come from the interstellar direction and are unlikely to be zodiacal dust grains, appeared south of -45 degrees latitude. One explanation is that these particles are beta-meteoroids accelerated away from the sun by radiation pressure and electromagnetic forces."

https://openalex.org/W2046842800,"Ulysses spacecraft radio and plasma wave observations indicate that some variations in the intensity and occurrence rate of electric and magnetic wave events are functions of heliographic latitude, distance from the sun, and phase of the solar cycle. At high heliographic latitudes, solartype Ill radio emissions did not descend to the local plasma frequency, in contrast to the emission frequencies of some bursts observed in the ecliptic. Short-duration bursts of electrostatic and electromagnetic waves were often found in association with depressions in magnetic field amplitude, known as magnetic holes. Extensive wave activity observed in magnetic clouds may exist because of unusually large electron-ion temperature ratios. The lower number of intense in situ wave events at high latitudes was likely due to the decreased variability of the high- latitude solar wind."
https://openalex.org/W2080605595,This editorial discusses the importance of developing alternative liquid fuels for the United States. It points out both the severe impact to US economy and life-style if liquid fuels were suddenly curtained and the significant benefits of an active alternative liquid fuel program. Biodiesel fuel using seed oils is particularly highlighted.

https://openalex.org/W2032690317,"PERIODIC DISCHARGING OF LIQUIDS AND INTERMITTENT WASHING OF SOLIDS A VERY efficient method of washing solids is an intermittent addition and draining of the solution. Also it is desirable in certain cases to add solution quickly for agitation but to drain slowly because of diffusion limitations from the surface or interior of the material being washed. Further, many substances such as shredded gels, being fragile, are partially lost in washing if agitation is done mechanically or by forcing gases through the bulk material."

https://openalex.org/W4298841009,"In the news article ""FDA puts the brakes on xenotransplants"" by Rachel Nowak (5 May, p. 630) the description of the response of Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in New York City to one of its investigators' proposal to test baboon-to-human heart transplants was incorrect. In fact, Columbia convened one panel of outside experts to advise its internal committees on the risks of xenotransplantation, and has since retained two outside experts as consultants to Robert Michler, the principle investigator for the xenotransplant trials. The institution also recommended that a group of experts on emerging infections be convened to examine the risk of viral transmission associated with xenotransplantation (Letters, 21 Apr., p. 349)."
