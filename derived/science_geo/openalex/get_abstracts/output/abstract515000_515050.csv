https://openalex.org/W2087814592,"If deprived of exogenous glutamine, naive mouse embryonic stem cells are shown to be capable of generating the amino acid from other sources to enable their proliferation; the stem cells use glutamine and glucose catabolism to maintain a high level of intracellular α-ketoglutarate and promote demethylation of chromatin and ensure sufficient expression of pluripotency-associated genes. The role of cellular metabolism in regulating stem cell proliferation and differentiation has not been explored in great detail. Craig Thompson and colleagues now show that naive mouse embryonic stem cells can proliferate in the absence of exogenous glutamine, an amino acid normally essential for the growth of mammalian cells, while consuming it avidly when it is present. The cells catabolize glutamine and glucose to maintain high levels of downstream metabolites controlling chromatin modifications and DNA methylation, so as to ensure sufficient expression of pluripotency-associated genes. The role of cellular metabolism in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation remains poorly understood1. For example, most mammalian cells cannot proliferate without exogenous glutamine supplementation even though glutamine is a non-essential amino acid1,2. Here we show that mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells grown under conditions that maintain naive pluripotency3 are capable of proliferation in the absence of exogenous glutamine. Despite this, ES cells consume high levels of exogenous glutamine when the metabolite is available. In comparison to more differentiated cells, naive ES cells utilize both glucose and glutamine catabolism to maintain a high level of intracellular α-ketoglutarate (αKG). Consequently, naive ES cells exhibit an elevated αKG to succinate ratio that promotes histone/DNA demethylation and maintains pluripotency. Direct manipulation of the intracellular αKG/succinate ratio is sufficient to regulate multiple chromatin modifications, including H3K27me3 and ten-eleven translocation (Tet)-dependent DNA demethylation, which contribute to the regulation of pluripotency-associated gene expression. In vitro, supplementation with cell-permeable αKG directly supports ES-cell self-renewal while cell-permeable succinate promotes differentiation. This work reveals that intracellular αKG/succinate levels can contribute to the maintenance of cellular identity and have a mechanistic role in the transcriptional and epigenetic state of stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W2075877031,"Somatic TP53 mutations are highly prevalent in therapy-related acute myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndrome, which arise as complications of cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiotherapy; although it was believed that these TP53 mutations are directly induced by cytotoxic therapy, new data indicate that they predate cytotoxic therapy and that haematopoietic progenitors harbouring these pre-existing mutations may selectively expand after exposure to chemotherapy or radiotherapy. The clonal haematopoietic disorders known as therapy-related acute myeloid leukaemia (t-AML) and therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome (t-MDS) typically develop 1 to 5 years after exposure to chemotherapy or radiotherapy. TP53 mutations are selectively enriched in t-AML/t-MDS, and were thought to be directly induced by cytotoxic therapy. Now Daniel Link and colleagues present genome sequencing data that suggest the TP53 mutations predate cytotoxic therapy. It appears that rare haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells in blood or bone marrow carry age-related TP53 mutations, and that these cells undergo clonal expansion only after selective pressure applied by chemotherapy. Therapy-related acute myeloid leukaemia (t-AML) and therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome (t-MDS) are well-recognized complications of cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy1. There are several features that distinguish t-AML from de novo AML, including a higher incidence of TP53 mutations2,3, abnormalities of chromosomes 5 or 7, complex cytogenetics and a reduced response to chemotherapy4. However, it is not clear how prior exposure to cytotoxic therapy influences leukaemogenesis. In particular, the mechanism by which TP53 mutations are selectively enriched in t-AML/t-MDS is unknown. Here, by sequencing the genomes of 22 patients with t-AML, we show that the total number of somatic single-nucleotide variants and the percentage of chemotherapy-related transversions are similar in t-AML and de novo AML, indicating that previous chemotherapy does not induce genome-wide DNA damage. We identified four cases of t-AML/t-MDS in which the exact TP53 mutation found at diagnosis was also present at low frequencies (0.003–0.7%) in mobilized blood leukocytes or bone marrow 3–6 years before the development of t-AML/t-MDS, including two cases in which the relevant TP53 mutation was detected before any chemotherapy. Moreover, functional TP53 mutations were identified in small populations of peripheral blood cells of healthy chemotherapy-naive elderly individuals. Finally, in mouse bone marrow chimaeras containing both wild-type and Tp53+/− haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), the Tp53+/− HSPCs preferentially expanded after exposure to chemotherapy. These data suggest that cytotoxic therapy does not directly induce TP53 mutations. Rather, they support a model in which rare HSPCs carrying age-related TP53 mutations are resistant to chemotherapy and expand preferentially after treatment. The early acquisition of TP53 mutations in the founding HSPC clone probably contributes to the frequent cytogenetic abnormalities and poor responses to chemotherapy that are typical of patients with t-AML/t-MDS."
https://openalex.org/W2050838276,"Exome sequence analysis of nearly 10,000 people was carried out to identify alleles associated with early-onset myocardial infarction; mutations in low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) or apolipoprotein A-V (APOA5) were associated with disease risk, identifying the key roles of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Sekar Kathiresan and colleagues use exome sequencing of nearly 10,000 people to probe the contribution of multiple rare mutations within a gene to risk for myocardial infarction at a population level. They find that mutations in low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) or apolipoprotein A-V (APOA5) are associated with disease risk. When compared with non-carriers, LDLR mutation carriers had higher plasma levels of LDL cholesterol, whereas APOA5 mutation carriers had higher plasma levels of triglycerides. As well as confirming that APOA5 is a myocardial infarction gene, this work informs the design and conduct of rare-variant association studies for complex diseases. Myocardial infarction (MI), a leading cause of death around the world, displays a complex pattern of inheritance1,2. When MI occurs early in life, genetic inheritance is a major component to risk1. Previously, rare mutations in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) genes have been shown to contribute to MI risk in individual families3,4,5,6,7,8, whereas common variants at more than 45 loci have been associated with MI risk in the population9,10,11,12,13,14,15. Here we evaluate how rare mutations contribute to early-onset MI risk in the population. We sequenced the protein-coding regions of 9,793 genomes from patients with MI at an early age (≤50 years in males and ≤60 years in females) along with MI-free controls. We identified two genes in which rare coding-sequence mutations were more frequent in MI cases versus controls at exome-wide significance. At low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), carriers of rare non-synonymous mutations were at 4.2-fold increased risk for MI; carriers of null alleles at LDLR were at even higher risk (13-fold difference). Approximately 2% of early MI cases harbour a rare, damaging mutation in LDLR; this estimate is similar to one made more than 40 years ago using an analysis of total cholesterol16. Among controls, about 1 in 217 carried an LDLR coding-sequence mutation and had plasma LDL cholesterol > 190 mg dl−1. At apolipoprotein A-V (APOA5), carriers of rare non-synonymous mutations were at 2.2-fold increased risk for MI. When compared with non-carriers, LDLR mutation carriers had higher plasma LDL cholesterol, whereas APOA5 mutation carriers had higher plasma triglycerides. Recent evidence has connected MI risk with coding-sequence mutations at two genes functionally related to APOA5, namely lipoprotein lipase15,17 and apolipoprotein C-III (refs 18, 19). Combined, these observations suggest that, as well as LDL cholesterol, disordered metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins contributes to MI risk."

https://openalex.org/W2029894473,"Affect experienced during an exercise session is purported to predict future exercise behaviour. Compared to continuous moderate-intensity exercise (CMI), the affective response to continuous vigorous-intensity exercise (CVI) has consistently been shown to be more aversive. The affective response, and overall tolerability to high-intensity interval training (HIT), is less studied. To date, there has yet to be a comparison between HIT, CVI, and CMI. The purpose of this study was to compare the tolerability and affective responses during HIT to CVI and CMI. This study utilized a repeated measures, randomized, counter-balanced design. Forty-four participants visited the laboratory on four occasions. Baseline fitness testing was conducted to establish peak power output in Watts (Wpeak). Three subsequent visits involved a single bout of a) HIT, corresponding to 1-minute at ∼100% Wpeak and 1-minute at ∼20% Wpeak for 20 minutes, b) CMI, corresponding to ∼40% Wpeak for 40 minutes, and c) CVI, corresponding to ∼80% Wpeak for 20 minutes. The order of the sessions was randomized. Affective responses were measured before, during and after each session. Task self-efficacy, intentions, enjoyment and preference were measured after sessions. Participants reported greater enjoyment of HIT as compared to CMI and CVI, with over 50% of participants reporting a preference to engage in HIT as opposed to either CMI or CVI. HIT was considered more pleasurable than CVI after exercise, but less pleasurable than CMI at these times. Despite this participants reported being just as confident to engage in HIT as they were CMI, but less confident to engage in CVI. This study highlights the utility of HIT in inactive individuals, and suggests that it may be a viable alternative to traditionally prescribed continuous modalities of exercise for promoting self-efficacy and enjoyment of exercise."
https://openalex.org/W2088306031,"It has been traditionally assumed that the heat released during a single enzymatic catalytic event does not perturb the enzyme in any way; however, here single-molecule fluorescence correlation spectroscopy is used to show that, for enzymes that catalyse chemical reactions with large reaction enthalpies, the heat released at the protein's active site during catalysis transiently displaces the protein's centre-of-mass, essentially giving rise to a recoil effect that propels the enzyme. Enzymes catalyse chemical transformations by lowering the activation energy of those reactions. It is traditionally assumed that the heat released during a single catalytic event (a 'turnover' event) does not perturb the enzyme in any way. In this manuscript, the authors used single-molecule fluorescence correlation spectroscopy to show that for enzymes that catalyse chemical reactions with large reaction enthalpies (for example, catalase or alkaline phosphatase), the heat released at the protein's active site during catalysis transiently displaces the protein's centre-of-mass, essentially giving rise to a recoil effect that propels the enzyme. This work helps explain the recent finding that the diffusivity of enzymes increases in a substrate-dependent manner during catalysis. Recent studies have shown that the diffusivity of enzymes increases in a substrate-dependent manner during catalysis1,2. Although this observation has been reported and characterized for several different systems3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10, the precise origin of this phenomenon is unknown. Calorimetric methods are often used to determine enthalpies from enzyme-catalysed reactions and can therefore provide important insight into their reaction mechanisms11,12. The ensemble averages involved in traditional bulk calorimetry cannot probe the transient effects that the energy exchanged in a reaction may have on the catalyst. Here we obtain single-molecule fluorescence correlation spectroscopy data and analyse them within the framework of a stochastic theory to demonstrate a mechanistic link between the enhanced diffusion of a single enzyme molecule and the heat released in the reaction. We propose that the heat released during catalysis generates an asymmetric pressure wave that results in a differential stress at the protein–solvent interface that transiently displaces the centre-of-mass of the enzyme (chemoacoustic effect). This novel perspective on how enzymes respond to the energy released during catalysis suggests a possible effect of the heat of reaction on the structural integrity and internal degrees of freedom of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2054261736,"The widespread reorganization of cellular architecture in mitosis is achieved through extensive protein phosphorylation, driven by the coordinated activation of a mitotic kinase network and repression of counteracting phosphatases. Phosphatase activity must subsequently be restored to promote mitotic exit. Although Cdc14 phosphatase drives this reversal in budding yeast, protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activities have each been independently linked to mitotic exit control in other eukaryotes. Here we describe a mitotic phosphatase relay in which PP1 reactivation is required for the reactivation of both PP2A-B55 and PP2A-B56 to coordinate mitotic progression and exit in fission yeast. The staged recruitment of PP1 (the Dis2 isoform) to the regulatory subunits of the PP2A-B55 and PP2A-B56 (B55 also known as Pab1; B56 also known as Par1) holoenzymes sequentially activates each phosphatase. The pathway is blocked in early mitosis because the Cdk1-cyclin B kinase (Cdk1 also known as Cdc2) inhibits PP1 activity, but declining cyclin B levels later in mitosis permit PP1 to auto-reactivate. PP1 first reactivates PP2A-B55; this enables PP2A-B55 in turn to promote the reactivation of PP2A-B56 by dephosphorylating a PP1-docking site in PP2A-B56, thereby promoting the recruitment of PP1. PP1 recruitment to human, mitotic PP2A-B56 holoenzymes and the sequences of these conserved PP1-docking motifs suggest that PP1 regulates PP2A-B55 and PP2A-B56 activities in a variety of signalling contexts throughout eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W2089605842,"The concept of germ layers has been one of the foremost organizing principles in developmental biology, classification, systematics and evolution for 150 years (refs 1 - 3). Of the three germ layers, the mesoderm is found in bilaterian animals but is absent in species in the phyla Cnidaria and Ctenophora, which has been taken as evidence that the mesoderm was the final germ layer to evolve. The origin of the ectoderm and endoderm germ layers, however, remains unclear, with models supporting the antecedence of each as well as a simultaneous origin. Here we determine the temporal and spatial components of gene expression spanning embryonic development for all Caenorhabditis elegans genes and use it to determine the evolutionary ages of the germ layers. The gene expression program of the mesoderm is induced after those of the ectoderm and endoderm, thus making it the last germ layer both to evolve and to develop. Strikingly, the C. elegans endoderm and ectoderm expression programs do not co-induce; rather the endoderm activates earlier, and this is also observed in the expression of endoderm orthologues during the embryology of the frog Xenopus tropicalis, the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis and the sponge Amphimedon queenslandica. Querying the phylogenetic ages of specifically expressed genes reveals that the endoderm comprises older genes. Taken together, we propose that the endoderm program dates back to the origin of multicellularity, whereas the ectoderm originated as a secondary germ layer freed from ancestral feeding functions."
https://openalex.org/W2103193274,"The rising incidence of obesity and related disorders such as diabetes and heart disease has focused considerable attention on the discovery of new therapeutics. One promising approach has been to increase the number or activity of brown-like adipocytes in white adipose depots, as this has been shown to prevent diet-induced obesity and reduce the incidence and severity of type 2 diabetes. Thus, the conversion of fat-storing cells into metabolically active thermogenic cells has become an appealing therapeutic strategy to combat obesity. Here, we report a screening platform for the identification of small molecules capable of promoting a white-to-brown metabolic conversion in human adipocytes. We identified two inhibitors of Janus kinase (JAK) activity with no precedent in adipose tissue biology that stably confer brown-like metabolic activity to white adipocytes. Importantly, these metabolically converted adipocytes exhibit elevated UCP1 expression and increased mitochondrial activity. We further found that repression of interferon signalling and activation of hedgehog signalling in JAK-inactivated adipocytes contributes to the metabolic conversion observed in these cells. Our findings highlight a previously unknown role for the JAK–STAT pathway in the control of adipocyte function and establish a platform to identify compounds for the treatment of obesity. Moisan, Cowan and colleagues perform a small-molecule screen to identify compounds that promote white-to-brown adipocyte conversion in vitro. They report that two inhibitors of the JAK–STAT signalling pathway stimulate browning of human adipocytes."

Previous studies have shown that NS5 residue Lys-330 is required for interaction between NS3 and NS5. Here, we show by competitive NS3-NS5 interaction ELISA that the NS3 peptide spanning residues 566–585 disrupts NS3-NS5 interaction but not the null-peptide bearing the N570A mutation. Small angle x-ray scattering study on NS3(172–618) helicase and covalently linked NS3(172–618)-NS5(320–341) reveals a rigid and compact formation of the latter, indicating that peptide NS5(320–341) engages in specific and discrete interaction with NS3.

https://openalex.org/W2020827067,"The ATP-gated P2X7 has been shown to play an important role in invasiveness and metastasis of some tumors. However, the possible links and underlying mechanisms between P2X7 and prostate cancer have not been elucidated. Here, we demonstrated that P2X7 was highly expressed in some prostate cancer cells. Down-regulation of P2X7 by siRNA significantly attenuated ATP- or BzATP-driven migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells in vitro, and inhibited tumor invasiveness and metastases in nude mice. In addition, silencing of P2X7 remarkably attenuated ATP- or BzATP- driven expression changes of EMT/invasion-related genes Snail, E-cadherin, Claudin-1, IL-8 and MMP-3, and weakened the phosphorylation of PI3K/AKT and ERK1/2 in vitro. Similar effects were observed in nude mice. These data indicate that P2X7 stimulates cell invasion and metastasis in prostate cancer cells via some EMT/invasion-related genes, as well as PI3K/AKT and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. P2X7 could be a promising therapeutic target for prostate cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2006792487,"Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) plays an important role in cellular bioenergetics. It is responsible for converting nicotinamide to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, an essential molecule in cellular metabolism. NAMPT has been extensively studied over the past decade due to its role as a key regulator of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide–consuming enzymes. NAMPT is also known as a potential target for therapeutic intervention due to its involvement in disease. In the current study, we used a global mass spectrometry–based metabolomic approach to investigate the effects of FK866, a small molecule inhibitor of NAMPT currently in clinical trials, on metabolic perturbations in human cancer cells. We treated A2780 (ovarian cancer) and HCT-116 (colorectal cancer) cell lines with FK866 in the presence and absence of nicotinic acid. Significant changes were observed in the amino acids metabolism and the purine and pyrimidine metabolism. We also observed metabolic alterations in glycolysis, the citric acid cycle (TCA), and the pentose phosphate pathway. To expand the range of the detected polar metabolites and improve data confidence, we applied a global metabolomics profiling platform by using both non-targeted and targeted hydrophilic (HILIC)-LC-MS and GC-MS analysis. We used Ingenuity Knowledge Base to facilitate the projection of metabolomics data onto metabolic pathways. Several metabolic pathways showed differential responses to FK866 based on several matches to the list of annotated metabolites. This study suggests that global metabolomics can be a useful tool in pharmacological studies of the mechanism of action of drugs at a cellular level."
https://openalex.org/W2066445249,"Invadopodia are actin-rich cell membrane projections used by invasive cells to penetrate the basement membrane. Control of invadopodia stability is critical for efficient degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM); however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we uncover a new role for podoplanin, a transmembrane glycoprotein closely associated with malignant progression of squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), in the regulation of invadopodia-mediated matrix degradation. Podoplanin downregulation in SCC cells impairs invadopodia stability, thereby reducing the efficiency of ECM degradation. We report podoplanin as a novel component of invadopodia-associated adhesion rings, where it clusters prior to matrix degradation. Early podoplanin recruitment to invadopodia is dependent on lipid rafts, whereas ezrin/moesin proteins mediate podoplanin ring assembly. Finally, we demonstrate that podoplanin regulates invadopodia maturation by acting upstream of the ROCK-LIMK-Cofilin pathway through the control of RhoC GTPase activity. Thus, podoplanin has a key role in the regulation of invadopodia function in SCC cells, controlling the initial steps of cancer cell invasion."

The significant links are obtained by selecting the largest values of the projected matrix. We first perform a number of tests of this filtering procedure on synthetic cases and a toy model. Then we analyze the bipartite network constituted by countries and exported products, using two databases for a total of almost 50 years. It is then possible to build a hierarchically directed network, in which the taxonomy of products emerges in a natural way. We study the influence of the structure of this taxonomy network on countries' development; in particular, guided by an example taken from the industrialization of South Korea, we link the structure of the taxonomy network to the empirical temporal connections between product activations, finding that the most relevant edges for countries' development are the ones suggested by our network. These results suggest paths in the product space which are easier to achieve, and so can drive countries' policies in the industrialization process."
https://openalex.org/W2053387216,"We recently demonstrated that expression of ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF)-like 4c (Arl4c) induced by a combination of Wnt/β-catenin and epidermal growth factor/Ras signaling in normal epithelial cells grown in three-dimensional culture promotes cellular migration and proliferation, resulting in formation of tube-like structures, suggesting the involvement of Arl4c in epithelial morphogenesis. It is conceivable that there could be a common mechanism between epithelial morphogenesis and carcinogenesis. Therefore the current study was conducted to investigate whether Arl4c might be involved in tumorigenesis. Immunohistochemical analyses of tissue specimens obtained from colorectal and lung cancer patients revealed that Arl4c was not observed in non-tumor regions but was strongly expressed at high frequencies in tumor lesions. Inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin or Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling reduced Arl4c mRNA levels in HCT116 colorectal cancer cells and A549 lung cancer cells. Knockdown of Arl4c inhibited Rac activity and also prevented nuclear localization of yes-associated protein (YAP)/transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) in these cancer cells. Arl4c-depleted cancer cells consistently showed decreased migration, invasion and proliferation capabilities both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, direct injection of Arl4c small interfering RNA (siRNA) into HCT116 cell-derived tumors (in vivo treatment with siRNA) inhibited tumor growth in immunodeficient mice. These results suggest that Arl4c is involved in tumorigenesis and might represent a novel therapeutic target for suppressing proliferation and invasion of colorectal and lung cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2156896013,"Many metabolic processes in plants are regulated by manganese (Mn) but limited information is available on the molecular mechanisms controlling cellular Mn homeostasis. In this study, a yeast assay was used to isolate and characterize two genes, MTP8.1 and MTP8.2, which encode membrane-bound proteins belonging to the cation diffusion facilitator (CDF) family in the cereal species barley (Hordeum vulgare). Transient expression in onion epidermal cells showed that MTP8.1 and MTP8.2 proteins fused to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) are localized to Golgi. When heterologously expressed in yeast, MTP8.1 and MTP8.2 were found to be Mn transporters catalysing Mn efflux in a similar manner as the Golgi localized endogenous yeast protein Pmr1p. The level of MTP8.1 transcripts in barley roots increased with external Mn supply ranging from deficiency to toxicity, while MTP8.2 transcripts decreased under the same conditions, indicating non-overlapping functions for the two genes. In barley leaves, the expression of both MTP8 genes declined in response to toxic Mn additions to the roots suggesting a role in ensuring proper delivery of Mn to Golgi. Based on the above we suggest that barley MTP8 proteins are involved in Mn loading to the Golgi apparatus and play a role in Mn homeostasis by delivering Mn to Mn-dependent enzymes and/or by facilitating Mn efflux via secretory vesicles. This study highlights the importance of MTP transporters in Mn homeostasis and is the first report of Golgi localized Mn2+ transport proteins in a monocot plant species."
https://openalex.org/W2121298850,"Long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) have critical regulatory roles in cancer biology; however, the contributions of lincRNAs to esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) have been infrequently explored. The aim of this study was to explore the contribution of lincRNAs, located at ESCC susceptibility loci identified by genome-wide association studies, to the risk and prognosis of ESCC. The associations between lincRNAs and the risk and prognosis of ESCC were analyzed in 358 diagnosed patients from eastern China, and the findings were validated in 326 additional patients from southern China. Functional relevance of lincRNAs was further examined by biochemical assays. We found that lincRNA-uc002yug.2 was commonly overexpressed in ESCC compared with paired peritumoral tissue in eastern and southern Chinese populations. The expression levels of lincRNA-uc002yug.2 in ESCC might be a prognostic factor for survival. Moreover, lincRNA-uc002yug.2 promoted a combination of RUNX1 and alternative splicing (AS) factors in the nucleus to produce more RUNX1a, the short isoform and inhibitor of RUNX1, and reduce CEBPα (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-α) gene expression, thereby promoting ESCC progression. These results indicated that lincRNA-uc002yug.2 might involve in AS of RUNX1/AML1 and serve as a predictor for esophageal cancer and prognosis."

Here, we demonstrated that Fh total extract (TE) reduced LPS-induced DC maturation, and the DC ability to induce allogeneic responses. After TE fractionating, a fraction lower than 10 kDa (F<10 kDa) was able to maintain the TE properties to modulate the DC pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine production induced by LPS. In addition, TE or F<10 kDa treatment decreased the ability of immature DC to stimulate the allogeneic responses and induced a novo allogeneic CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells. In contrast, treatment of DC with T/L or F<10 kDa plus LPS (F<10/L) induced a regulatory IL-27 dependent mechanism that diminished the proliferative and Th1 and Th17 allogeneic responses. Finally, we showed that a Kunitz type molecule (Fh-KTM), present in F<10 kDa, was responsible for suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokine production in LPS-activated DC, by printing tolerogenic features on DC that impaired their ability to induce inflammatory responses. These results suggest a modulatory role for this protein, which may be involved in the immune evasion mechanisms of the parasite."
https://openalex.org/W2007979842,"Hypoxia is a common feature of locally advanced breast cancers that is associated with increased metastasis and poorer survival. Stabilisation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF1α) in tumours causes transcriptional changes in numerous genes that function at distinct stages of the metastatic cascade. We demonstrate that expression of RIOK3 (RIght Open reading frame kinase 3) was increased during hypoxic exposure in an HIF1α-dependent manner. RIOK3 was localised to distinct cytoplasmic aggregates in normoxic cells and underwent redistribution to the leading edge of the cell in hypoxia with a corresponding change in the organisation of the actin cytoskeleton. Depletion of RIOK3 expression caused MDA-MB-231 to become elongated and this morphological change was due to a loss of protraction at the trailing edge of the cell. This phenotypic change resulted in reduced cell migration in two-dimensional cultures and inhibition of cell invasion through three-dimensional extracellular matrix. Proteomic analysis identified interactions of RIOK3 with actin and several actin-binding factors including tropomyosins (TPM3 and TPM4) and tropomodulin 3. Depletion of RIOK3 in cells resulted in fewer and less organised actin filaments. Analysis of these filaments showed reduced association of TPM3, particularly during hypoxia, suggesting that RIOK3 regulates actin filament specialisation. RIOK3 depletion reduced the dissemination of MDA-MB-231 cells in both a zebrafish model of systemic metastasis and a mouse model of pulmonary metastasis. These findings demonstrate that RIOK3 is necessary for maintaining actin cytoskeletal organisation required for migration and invasion, biological processes that are necessary for hypoxia-driven metastasis."

Methodology/Principal Findings Comparative de novo transcriptome analysis of S. paramamosain infected with V. parahaemolyticus was carried out to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the immune response to pathogenic bacteria by using the Illumina paired-end sequencing platform. A total of 52,934,042 clean reads from the hemocytes of V. parahaemolyticus-infected mud crabs and controls were obtained and assembled into 186,193 contigs. 59,120 unigenes were identified from 81,709 consensus sequences of mud crabs and 48,934 unigenes were matched proteins in the Nr or Swissprot databases. Among these, 10,566 unigenes belong to 3 categories of Gene Ontology, 25,349 to 30 categories of KEGG, and 15,191 to 25 categories of COG database, covering almost all functional categories. By using the Solexa/Illumina's DGE platform, 1213 differentially expressed genes (P<0.05), including 538 significantly up-regulated and 675 down-regulated, were detected in V. parahaemolyticus-infected crabs as compared to that in the controls. Transcript levels of randomly-chosen genes were further measured by quantitative real-time PCR to confirm the expression profiles. Many differentially expressed genes are involved in various immune processes, including stimulation of the Toll pathway, Immune Deficiency (IMD) pathway, Ras-regulated endocytosis, and proPO-activating system. Conclusions/Significance Analysis of the expression profile of crabs under infection provides invaluable new data for biological research in S. paramamosain, such as the identification of novel genes in the hemocytes during V. parahaemolyticus infection. These results will facilitate our comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms involved in the immune response to bacterial infection and will be helpful for diseases prevention in crab aquaculture."
https://openalex.org/W2099903218,"Background Typhoid fever remains a significant public health problem in developing countries. In October 2011, a typhoid fever epidemic was declared in Harare, Zimbabwe - the fourth enteric infection epidemic since 2008. To orient control activities, we described the epidemiology and spatiotemporal clustering of the epidemic in Dzivaresekwa and Kuwadzana, the two most affected suburbs of Harare. Methods A typhoid fever case-patient register was analysed to describe the epidemic. To explore clustering, we constructed a dataset comprising GPS coordinates of case-patient residences and randomly sampled residential locations (spatial controls). The scale and significance of clustering was explored with Ripley K functions. Cluster locations were determined by a random labelling technique and confirmed using Kulldorff's spatial scan statistic. Principal Findings We analysed data from 2570 confirmed and suspected case-patients, and found significant spatiotemporal clustering of typhoid fever in two non-overlapping areas, which appeared to be linked to environmental sources. Peak relative risk was more than six times greater than in areas lying outside the cluster ranges. Clusters were identified in similar geographical ranges by both random labelling and Kulldorff's spatial scan statistic. The spatial scale at which typhoid fever clustered was highly localised, with significant clustering at distances up to 4.5 km and peak levels at approximately 3.5 km. The epicentre of infection transmission shifted from one cluster to the other during the course of the epidemic. Conclusions This study demonstrated highly localised clustering of typhoid fever during an epidemic in an urban African setting, and highlights the importance of spatiotemporal analysis for making timely decisions about targetting prevention and control activities and reinforcing treatment during epidemics. This approach should be integrated into existing surveillance systems to facilitate early detection of epidemics and identify their spatial range."
https://openalex.org/W2069725260,"The scaffolding protein, hematopoietic PBX-interacting protein (HPIP/PBXIP1), regulates cell migration necessary for cancer cell dissemination. However, the mechanism that governs this process remains unknown. We show here that HPIP expression is associated with stages of breast cancer where cell dissemination results in poor patient outcome. Our investigation finds a novel association of HPIP with focal adhesion kinase (FAK) regulating FA dynamics. Interestingly, this interaction that led to activation of FAK protein was mediated by the C-terminal domain of HPIP and not the typical integrin-binding motif. Further, short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of FAK expression significantly reduced HPIP-induced cell migration indicating participation of FAK pathway. Live-cell time-lapse imaging and biochemical analysis further established the role of HPIP in microtubule-induced FA disassembly. We also found that HPIP-mediated MAPK activation led to phosphorylation and subsequent activation of calpain2, and the activated calpain2 in turn proteolyses FA protein, talin. Interestingly, HPIP is also proteolysed by calpain2 in breast cancer cells. The proteolysis of HPIP and talin by calpain2, and the activation of calapin2 by HPIP-mediated MAPK phosphorylation, is a novel regulatory axis to modulate the cell migration signal. Together, we have determined HPIP as a novel activator of FAK and a new substrate of calpain2. These molecular interactions between HPIP and FAK, and HPIP and calpain2 regulate cell adhesion and migration through modulation of FA dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W1988822872,"The enhancer of zeste homolog-2 (EZH2) represses gene transcription through histone H3 lysine-27-trimethylation (H3K27me3). Citrobacter rodentium (CR) promotes crypt hyperplasia and tumorigenesis by aberrantly regulating Wnt/β-catenin signaling. We aimed at investigating EZH2's role in epigenetically regulating Wnt/β-catenin signaling following bacterial infection. NIH:Swiss outbred and Apc(Min/+) mice were infected with CR (10(8) CFU); BLT1(-/-)Apc(Min/+) mice, azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-treated mice and de-identified human adenocarcinoma samples were the models of colon cancer. Following infection with wild-type but not mutant CR, elevated EZH2 levels in the crypt at days 6 and 12 (peak hyperplasia) coincided with increases in H3K27me3 and β-catenin levels, respectively. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed EZH2 and H3K27me3's occupancy on WIF1 (Wnt inhibitory factor 1) promoter resulting in reduced WIF1 mRNA and protein expression. Following EZH2 knockdown via small interfering RNA or EZH2-inhibitor deazaneplanocin A (Dznep) either alone or in combination with histone deacetylase inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, WIF1 promoter activity increased significantly while the overexpression of EZH2 attenuated WIF1 reporter activity. Ectopic overexpression of SET domain mutant (F681Y) almost completely rescued WIF1 reporter activity and partially rescued WIF1 protein levels, whereas H3K27me3 levels were significantly attenuated suggesting that an intact methyltransferases activity is required for EZH2-dependent effects. Interestingly, although β-catenin levels were lower in EZH2-knocked down cells, F681Y mutants exhibited only partial reduction in β-catenin levels. Besides EZH2, increases in miR-203 expression in the crypts at days 6 and 12 post infection correlated with reduced levels of its target WIF1; overexpression of miR-203 in primary colonocytes decreased WIF1 mRNA and protein levels. Elevated levels of EZH2 and β-catenin with concomitant decrease in WIF1 expression in the polyps of CR-infected Apc(Min/+) mice paralleled changes recorded in BLT1(-/-)Apc(Min/+), AOM/DSS and human adenocarcinomas. Thus, EZH2-induced downregulation of WIF1 expression may partially regulate Wnt/β-catenin-dependent crypt hyperplasia in response to CR infection."
https://openalex.org/W1994286558,"Protein kinase CK2 has diverse functions promoting and maintaining cancer phenotypes. We investigated the effect of CK2 inhibition in lung cancer cells with T790M-mediated resistance to the EGFR-TK inhibitor. Resistant sublines of PC-9 to gefitinib (PC-9/GR) and erlotinib (PC-9/ER) were established by previous study, and T790M secondary mutation was found in both resistant sublines. A decrease of EGFR by siRNA treatment effectively controlled the growth of resistant cells, thus suggesting that they still have EGFR-dependency. CX-4945, a potent and selective CK2 inhibitor, induced autophagy in PC-9/GR and PC-9/ER, and which was supported by the induction of autophagic vacuoles and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) expression, and the increase of punctate fluorescent signals in resistant cells pre-transfected with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged LC3. However, the withdrawal of CX-4945 led to the recovery of cancer cells with autophagy. We found that the induction of autophagy by CX-4945 in both resistant cells was CK2 dependent by using small interfering RNA against CK2. The treatment with CX-4945 alone induced a minimal growth inhibition in resistant cells. However, combined treatment of CX-4945 and EGFR-TKI effectively inhibited cancer-cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. CX-4945 increased the translocation of EGFR from the cell surface into the autophagosome, subsequently leading to the decrease of EGFR while inhibition of autophagy by 3MA or Atg7-targeted siRNA pretreatment reduced the decrease of EGFR by CX-4945. Accordingly, apoptosis by a combination of CX-4945 and EGFR-TKI was suppressed by 3MA or Atg7-targeted siRNA pretreatment, thus suggesting that autophagosome-mediated EGFR down-regulation would have an important role regarding apoptotic cell death by EGFR-TKI. Combined treatment of the CK2 inhibitor and EGFR-TKI may be a promising strategy for overcoming T790M-mediated resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2052114450,"Nuclear Foxc2 is a transcriptional regulator of mesenchymal transformation during developmental epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and has been associated with EMT in malignant epithelia. Our laboratory has shown that in normal epithelial cells Foxc2 is maintained in the cytoplasm where it promotes an epithelial phenotype. The Foxc2 amino terminus has a consensus casein kinase 2 (CK2) phosphorylation site at serine 124, and we now show that CK2 associates with Foxc2 and phosphorylates this site in vitro. Knockdown or inhibition of the CK2α/α′ kinase subunit in epithelial cells causes de novo accumulation of Foxc2 in the nucleus. Mutation of serine 124 to leucine promotes constitutive nuclear localization of Foxc2 and expression of mesenchymal genes, whereas an S124D phosphomimetic leads to constitutive cytoplasmic localization and epithelial maintenance. In malignant breast cancer cells, the CK2β regulatory subunit is downregulated and FOXC2 is found in the nucleus, correlating with an increase in α-smooth muscle actin (SMA) expression. Restoration of CK2β expression in these cells results in cytoplasmic localization of Foxc2, decreased α-SMA expression and reduced cell migration and invasion. In contrast, knockdown of CK2β in normal breast epithelial cells leads to FOXC2 nuclear localization, decreased E-cadherin expression, increased α-SMA and vimentin expression, and enhanced cell migration and invasion. Based on these findings, we propose that Foxc2 is functionally maintained in the cytoplasm of normal epithelial cells by CK2α/α′-mediated phosphorylation at serine 124, which is dependent on proper targeting of the holoenzyme via the CK2β regulatory subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1975233559,"Deregulation of matriptase is a consistent feature of human epithelial cancers and correlates with poor disease outcome. We have previously shown that matriptase promotes multi-stage squamous cell carcinogenesis in transgenic mice through dual activation of pro-hepatocyte growth factor-cMet-Akt-mTor proliferation/survival signaling and PAR-2-Gαi-NFκB inflammatory signaling. Matriptase was congenitally and constitutively deregulated in our prior studies, and therefore it was unclear if aberrant matriptase signaling supports only initiation of tumor formation or if it is also critical for the progression of established tumors. To determine this, we here have generated triple-transgenic mice with constitutive deregulation of matriptase and simultaneous inducible expression of the cognate matriptase inhibitor, hepatocyte growth factor inhibitor (HAI)-2. As expected, constitutive expression of HAI-2 suppressed the formation of matriptase-dependent tumors in 7,12-Dimethylbenz(a)anthracene-treated mouse skin. Interestingly, however, the induction of HAI-2 expression in already established tumors markedly impaired malignant progression and caused regression of individual tumors. Tumor regression correlated with reduced accumulation of tumor-associated inflammatory cells, likely caused by diminished expression of pro-tumorigenic inflammatory cytokines. The data suggest that matriptase-dependent signaling may be a therapeutic target for both squamous cell carcinoma chemoprevention and for the treatment of established tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2031129712,"All biological functions in vertebrates are synchronized with daily and seasonal changes in the environment by the time keeping hormone melatonin. Its nocturnal surge is primarily due to the rhythmic activity of the arylalkylamine N-acetyl transferase AANAT, which thus became the focus of many investigations regarding its evolution and function. Various vertebrate isoforms have been reported from cartilaginous fish to mammals but their origin has not been clearly established. Using phylogeny and synteny, we took advantage of the increasing number of available genomes in order to test whether the various rounds of vertebrate whole genome duplications were responsible for the diversification of AANAT. We highlight a gene secondary loss of the AANAT2 in the Sarcopterygii, revealing for the first time that the AAANAT1/2 duplication occurred before the divergence between Actinopterygii (bony fish) and Sarcopterygii (tetrapods, lobe-finned fish, and lungfish). We hypothesize the teleost-specific whole genome duplication (WDG) generated the appearance of the AANAT1a/1b and the AANAT2/2′paralogs, the 2′ isoform being rapidly lost in the teleost common ancestor (ray-finned fish). We also demonstrate the secondary loss of the AANAT1a in a Paracantopterygii (Atlantic cod) and of the 1b in some Ostariophysi (zebrafish and cave fish). Salmonids present an even more diverse set of AANATs that may be due to their specific WGD followed by secondary losses. We propose that vertebrate AANAT diversity resulted from 3 rounds of WGD followed by previously uncharacterized secondary losses. Extant isoforms show subfunctionalized localizations, enzyme activities and affinities that have increased with time since their emergence."
https://openalex.org/W1970589222,"Most deaths from breast cancer are caused by metastasis, a complex behavior of cancer cells involving migration, invasion, survival and microenvironment manipulation. Type Iγ phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase (PIPKIγ) regulates focal adhesion assembly and its phosphorylation at Y639 is critical for cell migration induced by EGF. However, the role of this lipid kinase in tumor metastasis remains unclear. Here we report that PIPKIγ is vital for breast cancer metastasis. Y639 of PIPKIγ can be phosphorylated by stimulation of EGF and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), two promoting factors for breast cancer progression. Histological analysis revealed elevated Y639 phosphorylation of PIPKIγ in invasive ductal carcinoma lesions and suggested a positive correlation with tumor grade. Orthotopically transplanted PIPKIγ-depleted breast cancer cells showed substantially reduced growth and metastasis, as well as suppressed expression of multiple genes related to cell migration and microenvironment manipulation. Re-expression of wild-type PIPKIγ in PIPKIγ-depleted cells restored tumor growth and metastasis, reinforcing the importance of PIPKIγ in breast cancer progression. Y639-to-F or a kinase-dead mutant of PIPKIγ could not recover the diminished metastasis in PIPKIγ-depleted cancer cells, suggesting that Y639 phosphorylation and lipid kinase activity are both required for development of metastasis. Further analysis with in vitro assays indicated that depleting PIPKIγ inhibited cell proliferation, MMP9 secretion and cell migration and invasion, lending molecular mechanisms for the eliminated cancer progression. These results suggest that PIPKIγ, downstream of EGF and/or HGF receptor, participates in breast cancer progression from multiple aspects and deserves further studies to explore its potential as a therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W2039070167,"Cell-free protein synthesis is a powerful method to explore the structure and function of membrane proteins and to analyze the targeting and translocation of proteins across the ER membrane. Developing a cell-free system based on cultured cells for the synthesis of membrane proteins could provide a highly reproducible alternative to the use of tissues from living animals. We isolated Sf21 microsomes from cultured insect cells by a simplified isolation procedure and evaluated the performance of the translocation system in combination with a cell-free translation system originating from the same source. The isolated microsomes contained the basic translocation machinery for polytopic membrane proteins including SRP-dependent targeting components, translocation channel (translocon)-dependent translocation, and the apparatus for signal peptide cleavage and N-linked glycosylation. A transporter protein synthesized with the cell-free system could be functionally reconstituted into a lipid bilayer. In addition, single and double labeling with non-natural amino acids could be achieved at both the lumen side and the cytosolic side in this system. Moreover, tail-anchored proteins, which are post-translationally integrated by the guided entry of tail-anchored proteins (GET) machinery, were inserted correctly into the microsomes. These results showed that the newly developed cell-free translocation system derived from cultured insect cells is a practical tool for the biogenesis of properly folded polytopic membrane proteins as well as tail-anchored proteins."

To assess the role of Ppp6c in carcinogenesis, we generated skin keratinocyte-specific Ppp6c conditional knockout mice and performed two-stage skin carcinogenesis analysis. Ppp6c deficiency induced papilloma formation with 7,12-dimethylbenz (a) anthracene (DMBA) only, and development of those papillomas was significantly accelerated compared with that seen following DMBA/TPA (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate) treatment of wild-type mice. NF-κB activation either by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α or interleukin (IL)-1β was enhanced in Ppp6c-deficient keratinocytes. Overall, we conclude that Ppp6c deficiency predisposes mice to skin carcinogenesis initiated by DMBA. This is the first report showing that such deficiency promotes tumor formation in mice."

Participants were categorized as having euthyroid, hypothyroid, or hyperthyroid status according to their thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to calculate the odds ratios (95% CI) for hyperuricaemia and gout in participants with thyroid dysfunction compared to euthyroid participants.A total of 87,813 (euthyroid, 83,502; hypothyroid, 1,460; hyperthyroid, 2,851) participants were included. The prevalence of hyperuricaemia was higher in hyperthyroid subjects (19.4%) than in euthyroid subjects (17.8%) but not in hypothyroid subjects (19.3%). The prevalence of gout was significantly higher in both hypothyroid (6.0%) and hyperthyroid (5.3%) subjects than in euthyroid subjects (4.3%). In men, hypothyroid or hyperthyroid status was not associated with hyperuricaemia. However, hypothyroid or hyperthyroid status was associated with ORs (95% CI) of 1.47 (1.10-1.97) and 1.37 (1.10-1.69), respectively, for gout. In women, hypothyroid status was not associated with hyperuricaemia or gout. However, hyperthyroid status was associated with ORs (95% CI) of 1.42 (1.24-1.62) for hyperuricaemia and 2.13 (1.58-2.87) for gout.Both hyperthyroid and hypothyroid status were significantly associated with gout and weakly associated with hyperuricaemia.

https://openalex.org/W1973070150,"Eukaryotic DNA replication initiates from multiple sites on each chromosome called replication origins (origins). In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, origins are defined at discrete sites. Regular spacing and diverse firing characteristics of origins are thought to be required for efficient completion of replication, especially in the presence of replication stress. However, a S. cerevisiae chromosome III harboring multiple origin deletions has been reported to replicate relatively normally, and yet how an origin-deficient chromosome could accomplish successful replication remains unknown. To address this issue, we deleted seven well-characterized origins from chromosome VI, and found that these deletions do not cause gross growth defects even in the presence of replication inhibitors. We demonstrated that the origin deletions do cause a strong decrease in the binding of the origin recognition complex. Unexpectedly, replication profiling of this chromosome showed that DNA replication initiates from non-canonical loci around deleted origins in yeast. These results suggest that replication initiation can be unexpectedly flexible in this organism."
https://openalex.org/W2111451693,"The Gibberella fujikuroi complex includes many Fusarium species that cause significant losses in yield and quality of agricultural and forestry crops. Due to their economic importance, whole-genome sequence information has rapidly become available for species including Fusarium circinatum, Fusarium fujikuroi and Fusarium verticillioides, each of which represent one of the three main clades known in this complex. However, no previous studies have explored the genomic commonalities and differences among these fungi. In this study, a previously completed genetic linkage map for an interspecific cross between Fusarium temperatum and F. circinatum, together with genomic sequence data, was utilized to consider the level of synteny between the three Fusarium genomes. Regions that are homologous amongst the Fusarium genomes examined were identified using in silico and pyrosequenced amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) fragment analyses. Homology was determined using BLAST analysis of the sequences, with 777 homologous regions aligned to F. fujikuroi and F. verticillioides. This also made it possible to assign the linkage groups from the interspecific cross to their corresponding chromosomes in F. verticillioides and F. fujikuroi, as well as to assign two previously unmapped supercontigs of F. verticillioides to probable chromosomal locations. We further found evidence of a reciprocal translocation between the distal ends of chromosome 8 and 11, which apparently originated before the divergence of F. circinatum and F. temperatum. Overall, a remarkable level of macrosynteny was observed among the three Fusarium genomes, when comparing AFLP fragments. This study not only demonstrates how in silico AFLPs can aid in the integration of a genetic linkage map to the physical genome, but it also highlights the benefits of using this tool to study genomic synteny and architecture."

Cells isolated by enzymatic digestion quickly lost maturity markers for smooth muscle cells and contained few enteric neural and glial cells. Cultured smooth muscle strips exhibited periodic contraction and maintained neural and glial markers. Smooth muscle strips cultured for 14 days also exhibited regular fluctuation of intracellular calcium, whereas cultured smooth muscle cells did not.

We show that when the inhomogeneity does not violate the symmetry of the system, synchrony is maintained and in some cases inhomogeneity enhances synchrony. On the other hand if the inhomogeneity breaks the symmetry of the system, zero lag synchrony can not be preserved. In this case we give analytical results for the phase lag of the spiking of the neurons in the stable state."

There are five known genera, from which only Mastadenoviruses have been widely studied. Apart from studying adenovirus as a biological model system and with a view to prevent or combat viral infection, there is a major interest in using adenovirus for vaccination, cancer therapy and gene therapy purposes. Adenoviruses from the Atadenovirus genus have been isolated from squamate reptile hosts, ruminants and birds and have a characteristic gene organization and capsid morphology. The carboxy-terminal virus-distal fibre head domains are likely responsible for primary receptor recognition. We determined the high-resolution crystal structure of the Snake Adenovirus 1 (SnAdV-1) fibre head using the multi-wavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) method. Despite the absence of significant sequence homology, this Atadenovirus fibre head has the same beta-sandwich propeller topology as other adenovirus fibre heads. However, it is about half the size, mainly due to much shorter loops connecting the beta-strands. The detailed structure of the SnAdV-1 fibre head and other animal adenovirus fibre heads, together with the future identification of their natural receptors, may lead to the development of new strategies to target adenovirus vectors to cells of interest."
https://openalex.org/W1980459067,"Streptococcus pyogenes adapts to different niches encountered in the human host via the activity of numerous regulatory proteins including the Rgg family of transcriptional regulators. The S. pyogenes chromosome encodes four Rgg paralogues designated Rgg1 (RopB), Rgg2 (MutR), Rgg3, and Rgg4 (ComR). In order to understand the role of the Rgg2 protein in the regulation of metabolic and virulence-associated properties of S. pyogenes, the rgg2 gene was inactivated in the M1 serotype strain SF370. Inactivation of rgg2 increased the growth yield of S. pyogenes in THY broth, increased biofilm formation, and increased production of SIC, which is an important virulence factor that inhibits complement mediated lysis. To identify Rgg2-regulated genes, the transcriptomes of SF370 and the rgg2 mutant strains were compared in the middle-exponential and post-exponential phases of growth. Rgg2 was found to control the expression of dozens of genes primarily in the exponential phase of growth, including genes associated with virulence (sse, scpA, slo, nga, mf-3), DNA transformation, and nucleotide metabolism. Inactivation of rgg2 decreased the ability of S. pyogenes to adhere to epithelial cells. In addition, the mutant strain was more sensitive to killing when incubated with human blood and avirulent in a murine bacteremia model. Finally, inoculation of mice with the avirulent rgg2 mutant of S. pyogenes SF370 conferred complete protection to mice subsequently challenged with the wild-type strain. Restoration of an intact rgg2 gene in mutant strain restored the wild-type phenotypes. Overall, the results demonstrate that Rgg2 is an important regulatory protein in S. pyogenes involved in controlling genes associated with both metabolism and virulence."

Herein, associations between numerous demographic, lifestyle, and health-related factors and the major causes of external mortality, such as suicide, homicide, and accident, were assessed prospectively among 73,422 black and white participants in the Southern Community Cohort Study (SCCS). Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated in multivariate regression analyses using the Cox proportional hazards model. Men compared with women (HR = 2.32; 95% CI: 1.87-2.89), current smokers (HR = 1.74; 95% CI: 1.40-2.17), and unemployed/never employed participants at the time of enrollment (HR = 1.67; 95% CI 1.38-2.02) had increased risk of dying from all external causes, with similarly elevated HRs for suicide, homicide, and accidental death among both blacks and whites. Blacks compared with whites had lower risk of accidental death (HR = 0.46; 95% CI: 0.38-0.57) and suicide (HR = 0.55; 95% CI: 0.31-0.99). Blacks and whites in the SCCS had comparable risks of homicide death (HR = 1.05; 95% CI: 0.63-1.76); however, whites in the SCCS had unusually high homicide rates compared with all whites who were resident in the 12 SCCS states, while black SCCS participants had homicide rates similar to those of all blacks residing in the SCCS states. Depression was the strongest risk factor for suicide, while being married was protective against death from homicide in both races. Being overweight/obese at enrollment was associated with reduced risks in all external causes of death, and the number of comorbid conditions was a risk factor for iatrogenic deaths. Most risk factors identified in earlier studies of external causes of death were confirmed in the SCCS cohort, in spite of the low SES of SCCS participants. Results from other epidemiologic cohorts are needed to confirm the novel findings identified in this study."
https://openalex.org/W2045251910,"We investigated the effect of leaf litter on below ground carbon export and soil carbon formation in order to understand how litter diversity affects carbon cycling in forest ecosystems. 13C labeled and unlabeled leaf litter of beech (Fagus sylvatica) and ash (Fraxinus excelsior), characterized by low and high decomposability, were used in a litter exchange experiment in the Hainich National Park (Thuringia, Germany). Litter was added in pure and mixed treatments with either beech or ash labeled with 13C. We collected soil water in 5 cm mineral soil depth below each treatment biweekly and determined dissolved organic carbon (DOC), δ13C values and anion contents. In addition, we measured carbon concentrations and δ13C values in the organic and mineral soil (collected in 1 cm increments) up to 5 cm soil depth at the end of the experiment. Litter-derived C contributes less than 1% to dissolved organic matter (DOM) collected in 5 cm mineral soil depth. Better decomposable ash litter released significantly more (0.50±0.17%) litter carbon than beech litter (0.17±0.07%). All soil layers held in total around 30% of litter-derived carbon, indicating the large retention potential of litter-derived C in the top soil. Interestingly, in mixed (ash and beech litter) treatments we did not find a higher contribution of better decomposable ash-derived carbon in DOM, O horizon or mineral soil. This suggest that the known selective decomposition of better decomposable litter by soil fauna has no or only minor effects on the release and formation of litter-derived DOM and soil organic matter. Overall our experiment showed that 1) litter-derived carbon is of low importance for dissolved organic carbon release and 2) litter of higher decomposability is faster decomposed, but litter diversity does not influence the carbon flow."
https://openalex.org/W2041874687,"Complex networks are frequently characterized by metrics for which particular subgraphs are counted. One statistic from this category, which we refer to as motif-role fingerprints, differs from global subgraph counts in that the number of subgraphs in which each node participates is counted. As with global subgraph counts, it can be important to distinguish between motif-role fingerprints that are 'structural' (induced subgraphs) and 'functional' (partial subgraphs). Here we show mathematically that a vector of all functional motif-role fingerprints can readily be obtained from an arbitrary directed adjacency matrix, and then converted to structural motif-role fingerprints by multiplying that vector by a specific invertible conversion matrix. This result demonstrates that a unique structural motif-role fingerprint exists for any given functional motif-role fingerprint. We demonstrate a similar result for the cases of functional and structural motif-fingerprints without node roles, and global subgraph counts that form the basis of standard motif analysis. We also explicitly highlight that motif-role fingerprints are elemental to several popular metrics for quantifying the subgraph structure of directed complex networks, including motif distributions, directed clustering coefficient, and transitivity. The relationships between each of these metrics and motif-role fingerprints also suggest new subtypes of directed clustering coefficients and transitivities. Our results have potential utility in analyzing directed synaptic networks constructed from neuronal connectome data, such as in terms of centrality. Other potential applications include anomaly detection in networks, identification of similar networks and identification of similar nodes within networks.

One of the serious complications of the replicating vaccine is eczema vaccinatum (EV) occurring in individuals with atopic dermatitis (AD), thus excluding them from all preventive vaccination schemes. In this study, we first characterized and compared development of eczema vaccinatum in different mouse strains. Nc/Nga, Balb/c and C57Bl/6J mice were epicutaneously sensitized with ovalbumin (OVA) or saline control to induce signs of atopic dermatitis and subsequently trans-dermally (t.d.) immunized with VACV strain Western Reserve (WR). Large primary lesions occurred in both mock- and OVA-sensitized Nc/Nga mice, while they remained small in Balb/c and C57Bl/6J mice. Satellite lesions developed in both mock- and OVA-sensitized Nc/Nga and in OVA-sensitized Balb/c mice with the rate 40-50%. Presence of mastocytes and eosinophils was the highest in Nc/Nga mice. Consequently, we have chosen Nc/Nga mice as a model of AD/EV and tested efficacy of MVA and Dryvax vaccinations against a lethal intra-nasal (i.n.) challenge with WR, the surrogate of smallpox. Inoculation of MVA intra-muscularly (i.m.) or t.d. resulted in no lesions, while inoculation of Dryvax t.d. yielded large primary and many satellite lesions similar to WR. Eighty three and 92% of mice vaccinated with a single dose of MVA i.m. or t.d., respectively, survived a lethal i.n. challenge with WR without any serious illness, while all Dryvax-vaccinated animals survived. This is the first formal prove of protective immunity against a lethal poxvirus challenge induced by vaccination with MVA in an atopic organism."
https://openalex.org/W2014750672,"The epigenetic DNA modifications 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in eukaryotes are recognized either in the context of double-stranded DNA (e.g., by the methyl-CpG binding domain of MeCP2), or in the flipped-out state (e.g., by the SRA domain of UHRF1). The SRA-like domains and the base-flipping mechanism for 5(h)mC recognition are also shared by the recently discovered prokaryotic modification-dependent endonucleases of the MspJI and PvuRts1I families. Since the mechanism of modified cytosine recognition by many potential eukaryotic and prokaryotic 5(h)mC “readers” is still unknown, a fast solution based method for the detection of extrahelical 5(h)mC would be very useful. In the present study we tested base-flipping by MspJI- and PvuRts1I-like restriction enzymes using several solution-based methods, including fluorescence measurements of the cytosine analog pyrrolocytosine and chemical modification of extrahelical pyrimidines with chloroacetaldehyde and KMnO4. We find that only KMnO4 proved an efficient probe for the positive display of flipped out pyrimidines, albeit the method required either non-physiological pH (4.3) or a substitution of the target cytosine with thymine. Our results imply that DNA recognition mechanism of 5(h)mC binding proteins should be tested using a combination of all available methods, as the lack of a positive signal in some assays does not exclude the base flipping mechanism."

Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) have primary cilia only on the distal tips of some dendrites. In order to better understand the relationship between receptor localization to cilia, cilia structure and cilia function, we have characterized a mutation originally identified in a forward genetic screen for mutants with defective PKD-2 ciliary localization. Through behavioral assays and examination of the structure of cilia in the cil-5 (my13) mutant animals, we have found that my13 disrupts not only receptor localization, but also some cilia-mediated sensory behaviors and cilia structural integrity. We have identified the my13 lesion and found that it is a missense mutation in bbs-7, an ortholog of human BBS-7, a gene known to affect human cilia and to be involved in Bardet-Biedl syndrome. Finally, we show that bbs-7(my13) also affects the glia cells which support the cilia."

It is also well known that depressive and anxiety disorders have a negative effect on subjective well-being. The aim of this cross-sectional, descriptive study was to assess the subjective well-being status of a group of primary healthcare patients in relation to socio-demographic characteristics, personal health and mood-status.A total of 284 patients participated in the study. The Oxford Happiness Scale, Life Satisfaction Scale, DASS-42 (Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales-42) and a questionnaire about socio-demographic characteristics were completed by the participants.In general, the participants were found to be moderately happy and satisfied with their lives. They had mild levels of depression, anxiety and stress. In terms of happiness, an older age (≥40 years), educated to secondary level or higher and not having depression or anxiety were found to be factors increasing happiness. In terms of life satisfaction, female gender, an older age (≥40 years), educated to secondary level or higher, being single and not having depression were found to increase life satisfaction.Primary healthcare providers should give more importance to the mood status of their patients. Screening for depression and anxiety should be applied at the primary healthcare level because negative mood status is more important than some socio-demographic characteristics in respect of unhappiness and dissatisfaction."

The proportion of patients lost to follow-up was 17%, suggesting that a larger scale study is feasible in this type of setting, but we found no preliminary evidence suggesting a positive effect on adherence by either financial incentives or pain-free lancets.

In the open form, the substrate-binding site of the SH3N domain is accessible, and it binds to target proteins with high affinity. In the closed form, SH3C engages in an intramolecular interaction with SH3N and thus occludes the ligand-binding site, which leads to an approximately 4-fold reduction in substrate affinity (11Schmidpeter P.A.

Src homology N- and C-terminal SH3 domains of c-CrkII Crk SH3 domain-binding guanine-nucleotide releasing factor guanidinium chloride nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid. The transition between the two states is regulated by a native state prolyl isomerization at Pro-238, which is located at the N-terminal end of the SH3C domain, right after the interdomain linker. With cis Pro-238, c-CrkII adopts the closed, low affinity form, whereas with trans Pro-238, the open, high affinity form is populated. In the isolated SH3C domain, the trans form is slightly favored, but in the presence of the interdomain linker and the SH3N domain (in SH3N-SH3C), the conformational equilibrium at Pro-238 is shifted toward cis. Surprisingly, the cis form was not detected in the NMR structure of human c-CrkII (6Kobashigawa Y. Sakai M. Naito M. Yokochi M. Kumeta H. Makino Y. Ogura K. Tanaka S. Inagaki F. Structural basis for the transforming activity of human cancer-related signaling adaptor protein CRK.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 503-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This difference between human and chicken c-CrkII could be traced back to two differences in sequence: position 239 is occupied by Ile in the human and Phe in the chicken protein, and position 272 is occupied by Val and Met, respectively. The corresponding substitutions I239F and V272M in combination were necessary and sufficient to induce the low affinity form with a cis Pro-238 in human c-CrkII as well (11Schmidpeter P.A. Schmid F.X. Molecular determinants of a regulatory prolyl isomerization in the signal adapter protein c-CrkII.ACS Chem. Biol. 2014; 9: 1145-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In the low affinity form, interactions must exist between the SH3N and SH3C domains to shift the cis/trans equilibrium at Pro-238 toward cis and, concomitantly, to lower the substrate affinity of SH3N. Such interactions could, however, not be detected. In the SH3N-SH3C protein, the two domains showed the same equilibrium stability and the same folding kinetics as in isolation (11Schmidpeter P.A. Schmid F.X. Molecular determinants of a regulatory prolyl isomerization in the signal adapter protein c-CrkII.ACS Chem. Biol. 2014; 9: 1145-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Here, we employed advanced kinetic techniques, in particular double-mixing experiments, to uncover domain interactions in c-CrkII and to elucidate how they are linked energetically with Pro-238 cis/trans isomerization in SH3C and with substrate binding to the SH3N domain. Based on these data and on kinetic simulations, we present a detailed mechanism that reveals the role of prolyl isomerization for the folding and the function of chicken c-CrkII, and we propose that the intrinsically slow isomerization at Pro-238 functions as a molecular memory, possibly as an attenuator, during the allosteric regulation of c-CrkII signaling. GdmCl ultra pure was purchased from MP Biomedicals (Santa Ana, CA). All other chemicals were purchased from Grüssing (Filsum, Germany). All constructs used in this study were cloned into pET11a as His6-Smt3-fusion proteins (SUMO protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Site-directed mutagenesis was done by QuikChange PCR. Protein expression was performed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and protein purification as previously described (11Schmidpeter P.A. Schmid F.X. Molecular determinants of a regulatory prolyl isomerization in the signal adapter protein c-CrkII.ACS Chem. Biol. 2014; 9: 1145-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Essentially, cells were grown in double-yeast-tryptone medium at 37 °C. At an A600 = 0.6, protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (final concentration, 1 mm) for 3.5 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (GS-3 rotor, 5,000 rpm, 20 min), homogenized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pHRT 8.0, 0.1 m NaCl, 10 mm EDTA) and disrupted using a microfluidizer. After centrifugation (SS-34 rotor, 15,000 rpm, 45 min), the supernatant containing the soluble fusion proteins was applied to a 5-ml Ni-NTA column (Qiagen), washed with 20 column volumes (50 mm Na2HPO4, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, pH 8.0) and eluted with 20 ml buffer (50 mm Na2HPO4, 100 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, pH 8.0). The His6-Smt3-tag was cleaved by His6-Senp2 overnight while dialyzing against buffer without imidazole (50 mm Na2HPO4, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm DTT). A second Ni-NTA step in the absence of imidazole was employed to remove the His6-Smt3 and His6-Senp2. The tag-free protein in the flow through was concentrated and applied to a 16/600 Superdex 75 prep grade gel filtration column in 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.4. The C3G-derived peptide of the sequence MYYDNSPPPALPPKKRQSAPS was also cloned into pET11 as a Smt3 fusion peptide and purified as described previously (11Schmidpeter P.A. Schmid F.X. Molecular determinants of a regulatory prolyl isomerization in the signal adapter protein c-CrkII.ACS Chem. Biol. 2014; 9: 1145-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The peptide was purified under denaturing conditions during the first Ni-NTA step (50 mm Na2HPO4, 100 mm NaCl, 6.0 m GdmCl, 10 mm imidazole, pH 8.0), and the His6-Smt3-tag was cleaved after the gel filtration. The final purification step was the second Ni-NTA step. All the double-mixing experiments were performed using a SX17 MV sequential mixing, stopped flow fluorescence spectrophotometer (Applied Photophysics). The first mixing was performed with an 11-fold dilution, and the second was performed with a 6-fold dilution. The GdmCl concentrations of stock solutions were determined by measuring the refractive index (12Pace C.N. Determination and analysis of urea and guanidine hydrochloride denaturation curves.Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2416) Google Scholar), and those after the first and second mixing step were determined by using the dilution factors of the stopped flow apparatus. All kinetics were measured at least eight times under identical conditions, averaged, and fitted to exponential functions to obtain the amplitudes and the rate constants of the monitored reaction. These amplitudes were plotted as a function of the time lapse between the first and second mixing, and the traces again were analyzed using exponential functions. This gives information about the progress of the reaction that was initiated by the first mixing. The dead time of the instrumental setup was determined to be 80 ms in the double-mixing mode. To analyze the refolding reaction, the proteins (33 μm solutions) were first denatured completely in 0.1 m potassium phosphate, 5.0 m GdmCl, pH 7.4, at 15 °C for at least 1 h. Refolding was initiated by 11-fold dilution with 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, at 15 °C. After different times, samples were mixed again with unfolding buffer to reach final conditions of 0.1 m potassium phosphate, 3.0 m GdmCl, pH 7.4, at 15 °C. The fluorescence change during this unfolding reaction of 0.5 μm protein was monitored above 320 nm after excitation at 280 nm. To detect the folding state of SH3N after different times of refolding, the proteins (33 μm solutions) were denatured in 0.1 m potassium phosphate, 5.0 m GdmCl, pH 7.4, at 15 °C for at least 1 h. 11-fold dilution with 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, at 15 °C initiated refolding for defined time intervals, after which the protein was mixed with the C3G peptide (2.4 μm in the syringe) to monitor the association reaction of SH3N (in different protein variants) with the peptide. The final conditions were 0.5 μm protein, 2.0 μm C3G peptide in 0.1 m potassium phosphate, 0.08 m GdmCl, pH 7.4, at 15 °C. To monitor the binding reaction selectively, fluorescence was measured above 320 nm after excitation at 295 nm. The unfolding reactions of the proteins were analyzed starting from native protein (33 μm protein in 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, at 15 °C). 11-fold dilution with unfolding buffer initiated the unfolding reaction in 0.1 m potassium phosphate, 3.0 m GdmCl, pH 7.4, at 15 °C. After different times of unfolding, samples were transferred back to folding conditions by a second mixing step with buffer without GdmCl (0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, at 15 °C). The final conditions were 0.5 μm protein in 0.1 m potassium phosphate, 0.5 m GdmCl, pH 7.4, at 15 °C. To accelerate the unfolding reaction, in another set of experiments the native protein (33 μm in 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, at 15 °C) was mixed with 0.1 m glycine, 3.3 m GdmCl, pH 1.8 (to reach final conditions of 3.0 m GdmCl, pH 2.0). After different times of unfolding samples were mixed with 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.6, at 15 °C to monitor the refolding reaction of 0.5 μm protein in 0.1 m potassium phosphate, 0.5 m GdmCl, pH 7.4, at 15 °C by detecting the fluorescence above 320 nm after excitation at 280 nm. The same experiments were performed after 33 μm of the protein variants was incubated with 66 μm of the C3G peptide for at least 1 h at 15 °C. The proline-limited binding reaction of chicken SH3N-SH3C and the P238A variant were monitored after manual mixing with a Jasco FP6500 fluorescence spectrophotometer. 1 μm of the SH3N-SH3C variant was incubated in 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, in the cuvette at 15 °C. Under constant stirring, increasing concentrations of the C3G peptide were added, and the fluorescence signal at 336 nm was monitored after excitation at 295 nm for 800 s. All measurements were repeated at least three times, averaged, and fitted to exponential functions to obtain the amplitude and the rate constant of the reaction. Theoretical calculations of the folding, the ligand binding and the ligand binding as a function of the refolding time were performed using Scientist 2.01 (MicroMath, Inc.). According to the six-species double-box model (see Fig. 8), the differential equations for all species were set up. Calculations were then performed for the same conditions as the corresponding experiments. The conformational refolding reactions of the two SH3 domains of c-CrkII differ ∼10-fold in rate. At low denaturant concentrations (0.5 m GdmCl) SH3N refolds in a single reaction with a rate of 0.8 s−1. SH3C refolds more rapidly in two reactions with rates of 8 and 2 s−1, which reflect the folding of the forms with trans and cis Pro-238, respectively (Fig. 1a). Both domains also show slow, denaturant-independent reactions in the 100-s time range that originate from the isomerization of prolines (11Schmidpeter P.A. Schmid F.X. Molecular determinants of a regulatory prolyl isomerization in the signal adapter protein c-CrkII.ACS Chem. Biol. 2014; 9: 1145-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). SH3C and SH3N also differ strongly in the rate of unfolding, and at 3.1 m GdmCl, SH3C unfolds 100-fold faster than SH3N (Fig. 1b). SH3C thus shows much higher overall folding dynamics than SH3N. These fluorescence-detected folding experiments did not provide evidence for a domain docking reaction, possibly because domain assembly is faster than domain folding or because it is not accompanied by a change in fluorescence. Late, spectroscopically silent processes in a folding reaction can be detected by a kinetic two-step assay that monitors the formation of fully folded molecules. This assay is based on the observation that protein molecules that have passed beyond the highest activation barrier during their assembly and thus have reached the fully folded state are separated from the unfolded state by this energy barrier. Thus, they unfold slowly when transferred to unfolding conditions. In the corresponding two-step assay for fully folded molecules (13Schmid F.X. Mechanism of folding of ribonuclease A: slow refolding is a sequential reaction via structural intermediates.Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 4690-4696Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), the unfolded protein is first mixed with refolding buffer to initiate its refolding. After variable times of refolding, the conditions are changed to unfolding, and the kinetics of the subsequent unfolding reactions are monitored. The amplitude of unfolding in this assay provides a direct measure for the fraction of molecules that had reached the native state at the time when refolding was stopped. For the isolated SH3C domain of chicken c-CrkII, the formation of native molecules during refolding at 0.5 m GdmCl was probed by unfolding assays performed at 3.5 m GdmCl (Fig. 2a) in stopped flow double-mixing experiments. Under the assay conditions, native SH3C unfolds with a rate of 4 s−1 (11Schmidpeter P.A. Schmid F.X. Molecular determinants of a regulatory prolyl isomerization in the signal adapter protein c-CrkII.ACS Chem. Biol. 2014; 9: 1145-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This rate is also observed in the unfolding assays at all times (Fig. 2a, upper panel), indicating that indeed the formation of fully folded molecules is monitored. Native SH3C forms in two reactions (Fig. 2a, lower panel) with rate constants of 9 and 0.026 s−1 (supplemental Table S1), similar to the rates obtained from the fluorescence detected refolding kinetics. The experimental data in Fig. 2a deviate slightly form the biexponential fit in the range between 0.5 and 3 s. This probably reflects the refolding reaction of the cis Pro-238 species. Its amplitude is small, because the trans form is favored in the denatured protein, which is the initial state in these experiments (11Schmidpeter P.A. Schmid F.X. Molecular determinants of a regulatory prolyl isomerization in the signal adapter protein c-CrkII.ACS Chem. Biol. 2014; 9: 1145-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The P238A variant showed similar kinetics of formation of the native protein. They followed the biexponential fit more closely, because the cis Pro-238-dependent second conformational refolding reaction is missing (Fig. 2a). Again, the formation of native molecules parallels the fluorescence-detected folding kinetics. Similar results were obtained for the human SH3C domain (Fig. 2c). Together, the results in Fig. 2 (a and c) indicate that for the isolated SH3C domains of human and chicken c-CrkII, the fluorescence-detected kinetics represent the formation of the fully folded state and that there are no additional spectroscopically silent folding reactions. The same stopped flow double-mixing analysis was performed for the chicken and the human SH3N-SH3C two-domain proteins (Fig. 2, b and d). Because SH3N unfolds 100-fold more slowly than SH3C, it virtually did not change its folding state within the 2-s time span that was used to follow the unfolding of SH3C. The unfolding assays thus monitored selectively the formation of the folded SH3C domain during the refolding of the SH3N-SH3C two-domain protein. The fully folded SH3C domains that were formed after various times of refolding all unfolded with the same rate constant of 4 s−1 as the isolated SH3C domain (Fig. 2). As for the isolated SH3C domains, two major refolding reactions were observed for SH3C in the SH3N-SH3C two-domain protein, and the time course of the formation of the native SH3C domain paralleled the fluorescence-detected folding of the isolated SH3C domain. Evidence for a domain assembly reaction with distinct kinetics could not be obtained. This shows that, in the folded SH3N-SH3C proteins, SH3C remains kinetically uncoupled from SH3N. The proline-limited, slow part of refolding is not abolished by the P238A substitution, but its time course is affected. This indicates that several prolines, including Pro-238, influence this reaction. The rate of unfolding of the SH3C domain remained constant over the entire time course of refolding (Fig. 2) of the isolated SH3C domains, of the two-domain proteins, and of the P238A variants of both the chicken and the human protein. This provides strong evidence that domain folding is not followed by a tight domain docking reaction. The model for the functional interplay between the two SH3 domains of chicken c-CrkII assumes that the accessibility of the SH3N domain for substrates is decreased by a domain closing reaction linked with trans → cis isomerization at Pro-238 in the SH3C domain. Here we used a peptide derived from the guanine nucleotide exchange factor C3G (Crk SH3-binding guanine-nucleotide releasing factor) (14Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H.

Again, in a double mixing experiment, unfolded protein (isolated SH3N or SH3N-SH3C) was exposed to refolding pulses of increasing length and then, in the second step, was not unfolded as before but mixed with the C3G peptide to follow the formation of binding active molecules. The binding reaction itself is more than 100-fold faster than the folding of SH3N. The dissociation constant KD of the complex between the isolated SH3N domain and the C3G peptide is 0.5 μm, and in the presence of 2 μm peptide, complex formation is thus ∼75% complete. The amplitude of the binding reaction therefore provides a measure for the formation of the native, binding-competent conformation during the initial folding pulse. This function-related refolding assay was first performed with the isolated SH3N domains from human and chicken c-CrkII (Fig. 3, a and c). Most of them regain the functional native state rapidly, within a few seconds. Then a minor phase follows, which reflects the slow refolding of molecules with wrong proline isomers in the SH3N domain (supplemental Table S1). The rate constant of association with the C3G peptide remains virtually constant over the whole time range (Fig. 3, a and c, upper panels). The peptide binding assay was then used to follow the folding of the two-domain protein SH3N-SH3C (Fig. 3, b and d). For human SH3N-SH3C, the amplitudes followed virtually the same time course as for the isolated SH3N domain (Fig. 3, c and d), evidently because SH3N folds in the two-domain protein as fast as in isolation and because the human two-domain protein remains in the domain-open, high affinity state after folding. The chicken SH3N-SH3C protein shows a different profile (Fig. 3b). As for the human protein, a fast initial increase in the extent of peptide binding was observed, which reflects the conformational folding reaction of the SH3N domain. After refolding pulses longer than 10 s, the amplitude of binding did not increase further (as for isolated SH3N and for human SH3N-SH3C) but instead decreased in a slow reaction. This indicates that a process occurs after domain folding that obstructs the binding site and counteracts the formation of additional binding active molecules in the course of the slow proline-limited reaction. Because this effect on the SH3N domain is abolished by the P238A substitution (Fig. 3b), we conclude that it originates from a slow domain closure reaction, caused by Pro-238 trans → cis isomerization. In 90% of the unfolded molecules, the Gly-237–Pro-238 bond is expected to be in the trans conformation (18Reimer U. Scherer G. Drewello M. Kruber S. Schutkowski M. Fischer G.

The rapid conformational folding thus leads to folded molecules that mostly adopt the high affinity, open state with trans Pro-238. In human SH3N-SH3C, the trans form of Pro-238 is favored in the folded state as well, and therefore the peptide binding site on SH3N remains continuously accessible. In the folded chicken SH3N-SH3C protein, the cis form of Pro-238 is favored (7Sarkar P. Reichman C. Saleh T. Birge R.B. Kalodimos C.G.

Therefore, trans → cis isomerization at Pro-238 occurs after conformational refolding. It leads to the closed low affinity state and thus to the observed decrease in C3G peptide binding (Fig. 3b). The analysis by NMR spectroscopy of chicken c-CrkII variants suggested that Pro-238 is cis in ∼90% of all molecules (9Sarkar P. Saleh T. Tzeng S.R. Birge R.B. Kalodimos C.G.

If they were completely deficient in binding, the amplitudes of binding in Fig. 3b would decrease to a value close to zero. This is not the case, which demonstrates that the cis Pro-238 form interacts with the peptide as well, but with a significantly reduced affinity, as recently suggested (11Schmidpeter P.A. Schmid F.X.

In the folded form of chicken c-CrkII, most molecules are in the low affinity form with cis Pro-238. However, the C3G peptide binds preferentially to the trans Pro-238 form, and therefore incubation of native chicken SH3N-SH3C with the C3G p"

In this investigation, we successfully established two relatively synchronous polyploid cell models by inducing Dami and CMK cells with SP600125. We found that SP600125 induced the polyploidization of Dami and CMK cells, concomitant with the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) at Thr421/Ser424 and dephosphorylation at Thr389. The polyploidization was partially blocked by H-89, a cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) inhibitor, through direct binding to S6K1, leading to dephosphorylation at Thr421/Ser424 and phosphorylation at Thr389, independent of PKA. Overexpression of a rapamycin-resistant mutant of S6K1 further enhanced the inhibitory effect of LY294002 on the SP600125-induced polyploidization of Dami and CMK cells. SP600125 also induced the polyploidization of Meg-01 cells, which are derived from a patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia, without causing a significant change in S6K1 phosphorylation. Additionally, SP600125 induced the polyploidization of HEL cells, which are derived from a patient with erythroleukemia, and phosphorylation at Thr389 of S6K1 was detected. However, the polyploidization of both Meg-01 cells and HEL cells as a result of SP600125 treatment was lower than that of SP600125-induced Dami and CMK cells, and it was not blocked by H-89 despite the increased phosphorylation of S6K1 at Thr389 in both cell lines in response to H-89. Given that the Dami and CMK cell lines were derived from patients with acute megakaryocytic leukemia (AMKL) and expressed high levels of platelet-specific antigens, our data suggested that SP600125-induced polyploidization is cell-type specific, that these cell lines were more differentiated, and that phosphorylation at Thr421/Ser424 and dephosphorylation at Thr389 of S6K1 may play an important role in the SP600125-induced polyploidization of these cell lines synergistically with other signaling pathways."
