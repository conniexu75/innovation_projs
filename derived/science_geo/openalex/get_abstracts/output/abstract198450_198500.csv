https://openalex.org/W126400802,"Studies in this laboratory designed to elucidate the metabolism of L-xylulose, the characteristic urinary sugar of essential pentosuria, have shown that n-glucuronolactone is a precursor of the ketopentose in guinea pigs and in humans (1, 2) and that there are enzymes in guinea pig liver which can interconvert L-xylulose and xylitol as well as xylitol and D-xylulose (3, 4). The discovery that n-xylulose 5-phosphate is an intermediate in the pentose phosphate shunt (6-phosphogluconate oxidation pathway) (5, 6) suggested that glucuronate and the xyluloses might be ultimately metabolized via this pathway (4, 7). A kinase has indeed been found in calf liver which can convert n-xylulose to n-xylulose 5-phosphate (8). These findings suggest that the following sequence of reactions occurs in mammals: n-glucuronate --) L-xylulose G= xylitol ti n-xylulose + D-xylulose 5-phosphate. Since the formulation of this sequence is based upon work done on different species and partly on enzymatic studies performed in vitro, it seemed desirable to obtain evidence in tivo regarding its physiological occurrence. The tracer experiments reported elsewhere (2) have demonstrated the conversion of n-glucuronolactone to L-xylulose in a pentosuric human through reactions involving loss of the carboxyl carbon of the former compound, with the aldehydic carbon becoming the fifth carbon of the pentose. The present paper reports a study of the metabolic fate of a compound which is intermediate in the reaction sequence shown above. Xylitol-l-Cl4 was chosen because it can be conveniently prepared from the readily available n-xylose-1-CY4. n-Ribose, known to be metabolized via the pentose phosphate shunt (9), and n-xylose were tested for comparative purposes. A recent report has shown that the latter is also metabolized via this pathway (10). It was first demonstrated that xylitol is oxidized in vivo to carbon dioxide. A study was then undertaken to determine whether the distribution of"

https://openalex.org/W2005633930,"THE technique of staining tissues specifically with fluorescein-Conjugated globulin has found wide application since it was introduced by Coons, Creech and Jones in 19421. Though Coons and Kaplan2 have recently introduced technical improvements the procedure remains in part tedious and time-consuming. Conjugation between fluorescein isocyanate and protein is effected in a bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.0) in the presence of dioxan and acetone2 ; conjugation, however, is never quantitative and the presence of free dye in the protein solutions is inevitable. The free fluorescein derivatives must be eliminated since, when present in tissue sections being viewed with the fluorescence microscope, they impart a hazy appearance. At present the free fluorescein derivatives are removed from conjugates mainly by exhaustive dialysis and afterwards by adsorption with acetone-extracted or lyophilized mouse liver preparations. The dialysis is time-consuming, while in our experience prolonged adsorption with organ preparations removes specific conjugates as is shown by a fall in the antibody titre."

https://openalex.org/W2048362625,"Chaudhuri and Kodicek1 have shown that almost the whole of the nicotinic acid in cereal bran was present in a bound form. They concentrated this ‘precursor’ of nicotinic acid from wheat bran considerably. Chaudhuri2, starting from rice bran in this laboratory, concentrated this substance about seventy times, following the concentration by the usual colorimetric method using p-aminobenzoic acid as the coupling reagent3. It has now been possible to isolate the bound form of nicotinic acid from rice bran in a crystalline state. This work has been facilitated by the observation that the active substance, when subjected to paper chromatography using phenol–water (80 : 20) as the solvent system, gave two ninhydrin-sensitive spots, one of which moved with the solvent front and produced a blackish-violet colour with ninhydrin. It also gave an orange colour when sprayed with p-aminobenzoic acid after exposure to cyanogen bromide vapour according to the method of Kodicek and Reddi4. The orange colour has been shown to be produced by the bound form, and it is insoluble in amyl alcohol, which dissolves the colour produced by free nicotinic acid as observed by Swaminathan5. A method developed by Das and Ghosh6 based on this observation has been used to follow the concentration of the bound form of nicotinic acid in the present work."
