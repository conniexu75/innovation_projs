https://openalex.org/W1970428833,"The phytoplankton community in the oligotrophic open ocean is numerically dominated by the cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus, accounting for approximately half of all photosynthesis. In the illuminated euphotic zone where Prochlorococcus grows, reactive oxygen species are continuously generated via photochemical reactions with dissolved organic matter. However, Prochlorococcus genomes lack catalase and additional protective mechanisms common in other aerobes, and this genus is highly susceptible to oxidative damage from hydrogen peroxide (HOOH). In this study we showed that the extant microbial community plays a vital, previously unrecognized role in cross-protecting Prochlorococcus from oxidative damage in the surface mixed layer of the oligotrophic ocean. Microbes are the primary HOOH sink in marine systems, and in the absence of the microbial community, surface waters in the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean accumulated HOOH to concentrations that were lethal for Prochlorococcus cultures. In laboratory experiments with the marine heterotroph Alteromonas sp., serving as a proxy for the natural community of HOOH-degrading microbes, bacterial depletion of HOOH from the extracellular milieu prevented oxidative damage to the cell envelope and photosystems of co-cultured Prochlorococcus, and facilitated the growth of Prochlorococcus at ecologically-relevant cell concentrations. Curiously, the more recently evolved lineages of Prochlorococcus that exploit the surface mixed layer niche were also the most sensitive to HOOH. The genomic streamlining of these evolved lineages during adaptation to the high-light exposed upper euphotic zone thus appears to be coincident with an acquired dependency on the extant HOOH-consuming community. These results underscore the importance of (indirect) biotic interactions in establishing niche boundaries, and highlight the impacts that community-level responses to stress may have in the ecological and evolutionary outcomes for co-existing species."
https://openalex.org/W2004922828,"Berberine (BBR) is a compound originally identified in a Chinese herbal medicine Huanglian (Coptis chinensis French). It improves glucose metabolism in type 2 diabetic patients. The mechanisms involve in activation of adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK) and improvement of insulin sensitivity. However, it is not clear if BBR reduces blood glucose through other mechanism. In this study, we addressed this issue by examining liver response to BBR in diabetic rats, in which hyperglycemia was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by high fat diet. We observed that BBR decreased fasting glucose significantly. Gluconeogenic genes, Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and Glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), were decreased in liver by BBR. Hepatic steatosis was also reduced by BBR and expression of fatty acid synthase (FAS) was inhibited in liver. Activities of transcription factors including Forkhead transcription factor O1 (FoxO1), sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1) and carbohydrate responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP) were decreased. Insulin signaling pathway was not altered in the liver. In cultured hepatocytes, BBR inhibited oxygen consumption and reduced intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) level. The data suggest that BBR improves fasting blood glucose by direct inhibition of gluconeogenesis in liver. This activity is not dependent on insulin action. The gluconeogenic inhibition is likely a result of mitochondria inhibition by BBR. The observation supports that BBR improves glucose metabolism through an insulin-independent pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2006344483,"Initiation, growth, recurrence, and metastasis of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) have been related to the behavior of cancer stem cells (CSC) that can be identified by their aldehyde-dehydrogenase-isoform-1 (ALDH1) activity. We quantified and enriched ALDH1(+) cells within HNSCC cell lines and subsequently characterized their phenotypical and functional properties like invasion capacity and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Spheroid culture enriched CSC from five HNSCC cell lines by up to 5-fold. In spheroid-derived cells (SDC) and the parental monolayer-derived cell line ALDH1, CD44, CD24, E-Cadherin, α-SMA, and Vimentin expression was compared by flow-cytometry and immunofluorescence together with proliferation and cell cycle analysis. Invasion activity was evaluated by Matrigel assay and expression of stemness-related transcription factors (TF) Nanog, Oct3/4, Sox2 and EMT-related genes Snail1 and 2, and Twist by real-time PCR. All cell lines formed spheroids that could self-renew and be serially re-passaged. ALDH1 expression was significantly higher in SDC. ALDH1(+) cells showed increased colony-formation. The proportion of cells with a putative CSC marker constellation of CD44(+)/CD24(-) was highly variable (0.5% to 96%) in monolayer and spheroid cultures and overlapped in 0%-33% with the CD44(+)/CD24(-)/ALDH1(+) cell subset. SDC had significantly higher invading activity. mRNA of the stemness-related genes Sox2, Nanog, and Oct3/4 was significantly increased in SDC of all cell lines. Twist was significantly increased in two while Snail2 showed a significant increase in one and a significant decrease in SDC of two cell lines. SDC had a higher G0 phase proportion, showed high-level expression of α-SMA and Vimentin, but significantly decreased E-Cadherin expression. HNSCC-lines harbor potential CSC, characterized by ALDH1 and stemness marker TF expression as well as properties like invasiveness, quiescence, and EMT. CSC can be enriched by anchorage-independent culture techniques, which may be important for the investigation of their contribution to therapy resistance, tumor recurrence and metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W1976232265,"Background The filamentous oomycete plant pathogen Phytophthora infestans causes late blight, an economically important disease, on members of the nightshade family (Solanaceae), such as the crop plants potato and tomato. The related plant Nicotiana benthamiana is a model system to study plant-pathogen interactions, and the susceptibility of N. benthamiana to Phytophthora species varies from susceptible to resistant. Little is known about the extent to which plant basal immunity, mediated by membrane receptors that recognise conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), contributes to P. infestans resistance. Principal Findings We found that different species of Phytophthora have varying degrees of virulence on N. benthamiana ranging from avirulence (incompatible interaction) to moderate virulence through to full aggressiveness. The leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK) BAK1/SERK3 is a major modulator of PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI) in Arabidopsis thaliana and N. benthamiana. We cloned two NbSerk3 homologs, NbSerk3A and NbSerk3B, from N. benthamiana based on sequence similarity to the A. thaliana gene. N. benthamiana plants silenced for NbSerk3 showed markedly enhanced susceptibility to P. infestans infection but were not altered in resistance to Phytophthora mirabilis, a sister species of P. infestans that specializes on a different host plant. Furthermore, silencing of NbSerk3 reduced the cell death response triggered by the INF1, a secreted P. infestans protein with features of PAMPs. Conclusions/Significance We demonstrated that N. benthamiana NbSERK3 significantly contributes to resistance to P. infestans and regulates the immune responses triggered by the P. infestans PAMP protein INF1. In the future, the identification of novel surface receptors that associate with NbSERK3A and/or NbSERK3B should lead to the identification of new receptors that mediate recognition of oomycete PAMPs, such as INF1."
https://openalex.org/W2019257830,"Background SRY (sex-determining region Y)-box 2 (SOX2) is a crucial transcription factor for the maintenance of embryonic stem cell pluripotency and the determination of cell fate. Previously, we demonstrated that SOX2 plays important roles in growth inhibition through cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and that SOX2 expression is frequently down-regulated in gastric cancers. However, the mechanisms underlying loss of SOX2 expression and its target genes involved in gastric carcinogenesis remain largely unknown. Here, we assessed whether microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate SOX2 expression in gastric cancers. Furthermore, we attempted to find downstream target genes of SOX2 contributing to gastric carcinogenesis. Methodology/Principal Findings We performed in silico analysis and focused on miRNA-126 (miR-126) as a potential SOX2 regulator. Gain- and loss-of function experiments and luciferase assays revealed that miR-126 inhibited SOX2 expression by targeting two binding sites in the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of SOX2 mRNA in multiple cell lines. In addition, miR-126 was highly expressed in some cultured and primary gastric cancer cells with low SOX2 protein levels. Furthermore, exogenous miR-126 over-expression as well as siRNA-mediated knockdown of SOX2 significantly enhanced the anchorage-dependent and -independent growth of gastric cancer cell lines. We next performed microarray analysis after SOX2 over-expression in a gastric cancer cell line, and found that expression of the placenta-specific 1 (PLAC1) gene was significantly down-regulated by SOX2 over-expression. siRNA- and miR-126-mediated SOX2 knockdown experiments revealed that miR-126 positively regulated PLAC1 expression through suppression of SOX2 expression in gastric cancer cells. Conclusions Taken together, our results indicate that miR-126 is a novel miRNA that targets SOX2, and PLAC1 may be a novel downstream target gene of SOX2 in gastric cancer cells. These findings suggest that aberrant over-expression of miR-126 and consequent SOX2 down-regulation may contribute to gastric carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2005721307,"Many genes which are associated with root nodule development and activity in the model legume Medicago truncatula have been described. However information on precise stages of activation of these genes and their corresponding transcriptional regulators is often lacking. Whether these regulators are shared with other plant developmental programs also remains an open question. Here detailed microarray analyses have been used to study the transcriptome of root nodules induced by either wild type or mutant strains of Sinorhizobium meliloti. In this way we have defined eight major activation patterns in nodules and identified associated potential regulatory genes. We have shown that transcription reprogramming during consecutive stages of nodule differentiation occurs in four major phases, respectively associated with (i) early signalling events and/or bacterial infection; plant cell differentiation that is either (ii) independent or (iii) dependent on bacteroid differentiation; (iv) nitrogen fixation. Differential expression of several genes involved in cytokinin biosynthesis was observed in early symbiotic nodule zones, suggesting that cytokinin levels are actively controlled in this region. Taking advantage of databases recently developed for M. truncatula, we identified a small subset of gene expression regulators that were exclusively or predominantly expressed in nodules, whereas most other regulators were also activated under other conditions, and notably in response to abiotic or biotic stresses. We found evidence suggesting the activation of the jasmonate pathway in both wild type and mutant nodules, thus raising questions about the role of jasmonate during nodule development. Finally, quantitative RT-PCR was used to analyse the expression of a series of nodule regulator and marker genes at early symbiotic stages in roots and allowed us to distinguish several early stages of gene expression activation or repression."
https://openalex.org/W1986623751,"We previously identified and purified a human ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex with similarity to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae INO80 complex (Jin, J., Cai, Y., Yao, T., Gottschalk, A. J., Florens, L., Swanson, S. K., Gutierrez, J. L., Coleman, M. K., Workman, J. L., Mushegian, A., Washburn, M. P., Conaway, R. C., and Conaway, J. W. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 41207-41212) and demonstrated that it is composed of (i) a Snf2 family ATPase (hIno80) related in sequence to the S. cerevisiae Ino80 ATPase; (ii) seven additional evolutionarily conserved subunits orthologous to yeast INO80 complex subunits; and (iii) six apparently metazoan-specific subunits. In this report, we present evidence that the human INO80 complex is composed of three modules that assemble with three distinct domains of the hIno80 ATPase. These modules include (i) one that is composed of the N terminus of the hIno80 protein and all of the metazoan-specific subunits and is not required for ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling; (ii) a second that is composed of the hIno80 Snf2-like ATPase/helicase and helicase-SANT-associated/post-HSA (HSA/PTH) domain, the actin-related proteins Arp4 and Arp8, and the GLI-Kruppel family transcription factor YY1; and (iii) a third that is composed of the hIno80 Snf2 ATPase domain, the Ies2 and Ies6 proteins, the AAA(+) ATPases Tip49a and Tip49b, and the actin-related protein Arp5. Through purification and characterization of hINO80 complex subassemblies, we demonstrate that ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling by the hINO80 complex is catalyzed by a core complex comprising the hIno80 protein HSA/PTH and Snf2 ATPase domains acting in concert with YY1 and the complete set of its evolutionarily conserved subunits. Taken together, our findings shed new light on the structure and function of the INO80 chromatin-remodeling complex."
https://openalex.org/W2064786372,"Epidemiological studies show that approximately 20–30% of chronic smokers develop chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) while 10–15% develop lung cancer. COPD pre-exists lung cancer in 50–90% of cases and has a heritability of 40–77%, much greater than for lung cancer with heritability of 15–25%. These data suggest that smokers susceptible to COPD may also be susceptible to lung cancer. This study examines the association of several overlapping chromosomal loci, recently implicated by GWA studies in COPD, lung function and lung cancer, in (n = 1400) subjects sub-phenotyped for the presence of COPD and matched for smoking exposure. Using this approach we show; the 15q25 locus confers susceptibility to lung cancer and COPD, the 4q31 and 4q22 loci both confer a reduced risk to both COPD and lung cancer, the 6p21 locus confers susceptibility to lung cancer in smokers with pre-existing COPD, the 5p15 and 1q23 loci both confer susceptibility to lung cancer in those with no pre-existing COPD. We also show the 5q33 locus, previously associated with reduced FEV1, appears to confer susceptibility to both COPD and lung cancer. The 6p21 locus previously linked to reduced FEV1 is associated with COPD only. Larger studies will be needed to distinguish whether these COPD-related effects may reflect, in part, associations specific to different lung cancer histology. We demonstrate that when the “risk genotypes” derived from the univariate analysis are incorporated into an algorithm with clinical variables, independently associated with lung cancer in multivariate analysis, modest discrimination is possible on receiver operator curve analysis (AUC = 0.70). We suggest that genetic susceptibility to lung cancer includes genes conferring susceptibility to COPD and that sub-phenotyping with spirometry is critical to identifying genes underlying the development of lung cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1999715276,"Background Therapy for neural lesions or degenerative diseases relies mainly on finding transplantable active precursor cells. Identifying them in peripheral tissues accessible for biopsy, outside the central nervous system, would circumvent the serious immunological and ethical concerns impeding cell therapy. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we isolated neural progenitor cells in cultured adult skeletal muscle from transgenic mice in which nestin regulatory elements control GFP expression. These cells also expressed the early neural marker Tuj1 and light and heavy neurofilament but not S100β, indicating that they express typical neural but not Schwann cell markers. GFP+/Tuj1+ cells were also negative for the endothelial and pericyte markers CD31 and α-smooth muscle actin, respectively. We established their a) functional response to glutamate in patch-clamp recordings; b) interstitial mesenchymal origin; c) replicative capacity; and d) the environment necessary for their survival after fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Conclusions/Significance We propose that the decline in nestin-GFP expression in muscle progenitor cells and its persistence in neural precursor cells in muscle cultures provide an invaluable tool for isolating a population of predifferentiated neural cells with therapeutic potential."
https://openalex.org/W2069316464,"The question whether decapitation is a humane method of euthanasia in awake animals is being debated. To gather arguments in this debate, obsolete rats were decapitated while recording the EEG, both of awake rats and of anesthetized rats. Following decapitation a fast and global loss of power of the EEG was observed; the power in the 13–100 Hz frequency band, expressing cognitive activity, decreased according to an exponential decay function to half the initial value within 4 seconds. Whereas the pre-decapitation EEG of the anesthetized animals showed a burst suppression pattern quite different from the awake animals, the power in the postdecapitation EEG did not differ between the two groups. This might indicate that either the power of the EEG does not correlate well with consciousness or that consciousness is briefly regained in the anesthetized group after decapitation. Remarkably, after 50 seconds (awake group) or 80 seconds (anesthetized group) following decapitation, a high amplitude slow wave was observed. The EEG before this wave had more power than the signal after the wave. This wave might be due to a simultaneous massive loss of membrane potentials of the neurons. Still functioning ion channels, which keep the membrane potential intact before the wave, might explain the observed power difference. Two conclusions were drawn from this experiment. It is likely that consciousness vanishes within seconds after decapitation, implying that decapitation is a quick and not an inhumane method of euthanasia. It seems that the massive wave which can be recorded approximately one minute after decapitation reflects the ultimate border between life and death. This observation might have implications in the discussions on the appropriate time for organ donation."
https://openalex.org/W1997845502,"Background Mutations in the FRY1/SAL1 Arabidopsis locus are highly pleiotropic, affecting drought tolerance, leaf shape and root growth. FRY1 encodes a nucleotide phosphatase that in vitro has inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatase and 3′,(2′),5′-bisphosphate nucleotide phosphatase activities. It is not clear which activity mediates each of the diverse biological functions of FRY1 in planta. Principal Findings A fry1 mutant was identified in a genetic screen for Arabidopsis mutants deregulated in the expression of Pi High affinity Transporter 1;4 (PHT1;4). Histological analysis revealed that, in roots, FRY1 expression was restricted to the stele and meristems. The fry1 mutant displayed an altered root architecture phenotype and an increased drought tolerance. All of the phenotypes analyzed were complemented with the AHL gene encoding a protein that converts 3′-polyadenosine 5′-phosphate (PAP) into AMP and Pi. PAP is known to inhibit exoribonucleases (XRN) in vitro. Accordingly, an xrn triple mutant with mutations in all three XRNs shared the fry1 drought tolerance and root architecture phenotypes. Interestingly these two traits were also complemented by grafting, revealing that drought tolerance was primarily conferred by the rosette and that the root architecture can be complemented by long-distance regulation derived from leaves. By contrast, PHT1 expression was not altered in xrn mutants or in grafting experiments. Thus, PHT1 up-regulation probably resulted from a local depletion of Pi in the fry1 stele. This hypothesis is supported by the identification of other genes modulated by Pi deficiency in the stele, which are found induced in a fry1 background. Conclusions/Significance Our results indicate that the 3′,(2′),5′-bisphosphate nucleotide phosphatase activity of FRY1 is involved in long-distance as well as local regulatory activities in roots. The local up-regulation of PHT1 genes transcription in roots likely results from local depletion of Pi and is independent of the XRNs."
https://openalex.org/W1990800915,"The identification of mechanisms that mediate stress-induced hippocampal damage may shed new light into the pathophysiology of depressive disorders and provide new targets for therapeutic intervention. We focused on the secreted glycoprotein Dickkopf-1 (Dkk-1), an inhibitor of the canonical Wnt pathway, involved in neurodegeneration. Mice exposed to mild restraint stress showed increased hippocampal levels of Dkk-1 and reduced expression of β-catenin, an intracellular protein positively regulated by the canonical Wnt signalling pathway. In adrenalectomized mice, Dkk-1 was induced by corticosterone injection, but not by exposure to stress. Corticosterone also induced Dkk-1 in mouse organotypic hippocampal cultures and primary cultures of hippocampal neurons and, at least in the latter model, the action of corticosterone was reversed by the type-2 glucocorticoid receptor antagonist mifepristone. To examine whether induction of Dkk-1 was causally related to stress-induced hippocampal damage, we used doubleridge mice, which are characterized by a defective induction of Dkk-1. As compared to control mice, doubleridge mice showed a paradoxical increase in basal hippocampal Dkk-1 levels, but no Dkk-1 induction in response to stress. In contrast, stress reduced Dkk-1 levels in doubleridge mice. In control mice, chronic stress induced a reduction in hippocampal volume associated with neuronal loss and dendritic atrophy in the CA1 region, and a reduced neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus. Doubleridge mice were resistant to the detrimental effect of chronic stress and, instead, responded to stress with increases in dendritic arborisation and neurogenesis. Thus, the outcome of chronic stress was tightly related to changes in Dkk-1 expression in the hippocampus. These data indicate that induction of Dkk-1 is causally related to stress-induced hippocampal damage and provide the first evidence that Dkk-1 expression is regulated by corticosteroids in the central nervous system. Drugs that rescue the canonical Wnt pathway may attenuate hippocampal damage in major depression and other stress-related disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2056331509,"Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) have the ability to differentiate into osteoblasts, adipocytes and chondrocytes. We have previously shown that hMSC were endowed with a basal level of Hedgehog signaling that decreased after differentiation of these cells. Since hMSC differentiation is associated with growth-arrest we investigated the function of Hh signaling on cell proliferation. Here, we show that inhibition of Hh signaling, using the classical inhibitor cyclopamine, or a siRNA directed against Gli-2, leads to a decrease in hMSC proliferation. This phenomenon is not linked to apoptosis but to a block of the cells in the G0/G1 phases of the cell cycle. At the molecular level, it is associated with an increase in the active form of pRB, and a decrease in cyclin A expression and MAP kinase phosphorylation. Inhibition of Hh signaling is also associated with a decrease in the ability of the cells to form clones. By contrast, inhibition of Hh signaling during hMSC proliferation does not affect their ability to differentiate. This study demonstrates that hMSC are endowed with a basal Hedgehog signaling activity that is necessary for efficient proliferation and clonogenicity of hMSC. This observation unravels an unexpected new function for Hedgehog signaling in the regulation of human mesenchymal stem cells and highlights the critical function of this morphogen in hMSC biology."
https://openalex.org/W2073471607,"Interleukin-13 (IL-13) has been linked to the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. It is postulated that IL-13 drives inflammatory lesions through the modulation of both hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cell function in the intestine. To delineate the relevant contribution of elevated levels of intestinal IL-13 to intestinal structure and function, we generated an intestinal IL-13 transgenic mouse (iIL-13Tg). We show that constitutive overexpression of IL-13 in the small bowel induces modification of intestinal epithelial architecture (villus blunting, goblet cell hyperplasia, and increased epithelial proliferation) and epithelial function (altered basolateral → apical Cl− ion conductance). Pharmacological analyses in vitro and in vivo determined that elevated Cl− conductance is mediated by altered cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator expression and activity. Generation of iIL-13Tg/Il13rα1−/−, iIL-13Tg/Il13rα2−/−, and iIL-13Tg/Stat6−/− mice revealed that IL-13-mediated dysregulation of epithelial architecture and Cl− conductance is dependent on IL-13Rα1 and STAT-6. These observations demonstrate a central role for the IL-13/IL-13Rα1 pathway in the regulation of intestinal epithelial cell Cl− secretion via up-regulation of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, suggesting an important role for this pathway in secretory diarrhea.

https://openalex.org/W2048637444,"Ion permeation through voltage-gated sodium channels is modulated by various drugs and toxins. The atomistic mechanisms of action of many toxins are poorly understood. A steroidal alkaloid batrachotoxin (BTX) causes persistent channel activation by inhibiting inactivation and shifting the voltage dependence of activation to more negative potentials. Traditionally, BTX is considered to bind at the channel-lipid interface and allosterically modulate the ion permeation. However, amino acid residues critical for BTX action are found in the inner helices of all four repeats, suggesting that BTX binds in the pore. In the octapeptide segment IFGSFFTL in IIIS6 of a cockroach sodium channel BgNa(V), besides Ser_3i15 and Leu_3i19, which correspond to known BTX-sensing residues of mammalian sodium channels, we found that Gly_3i14 and Phe_3i16 are critical for BTX action. Using these data along with published data as distance constraints, we docked BTX in the Kv1.2-based homology model of the open BgNa(V) channel. We arrived at a model in which BTX adopts a horseshoe conformation with the horseshoe plane normal to the pore axis. The BTX ammonium group is engaged in cation-π interactions with Phe_3i16 and BTX moieties interact with known BTX-sensing residues in all four repeats. Oxygen atoms at the horseshoe inner surface constitute a transient binding site for permeating cations, whereas the bulky BTX molecule would resist the pore closure, thus causing persistent channel activation. Our study reinforces the concept that steroidal sodium channel agonists bind in the inner pore of sodium channels and elaborates the atomistic mechanism of BTX action."
https://openalex.org/W1986537848,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in regulating post-transcriptional gene repression in a variety of immunological processes. In particular, much attention has been focused on their roles in regulatory T (Treg) cells which are crucial for maintaining peripheral tolerance and controlling T cell responses. Recently, we established a novel type of human Treg cell line, termed HOZOT, multifunctional cells exhibiting a CD4+CD8+ phenotype. In this study, we performed miRNA profiling to identify signature miRNAs of HOZOT, and therein identified miR-155. Although miR-155 has also been characterized as a signature miRNA for FOXP3+ natural Treg (nTreg) cells, it was expressed quite differently in HOZOT cells. Under both stimulatory and non-stimulatory conditions, miR-155 expression remained at low levels in HOZOT, while its expression in nTreg and conventional T cells remarkably increased after stimulation. We next searched candidate target genes of miR-155 through bioinformatics, and identified FOXO3a, a negative regulator of Akt signaling, as a miR-155 target gene. Further studies by gain- and loss-of-function experiments supported a role for miR-155 in the regulation of FOXO3a protein expression in conventional T and HOZOT cells."
https://openalex.org/W2032067160,"Angiogenesis is very important for vascularized tissue engineering. In this study, we found that a two-dimensional co-culture of human bone marrow stromal cell (HBMSC) and human umbical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) is able to stimulate the migration of co-cultured HUVEC and induce self-assembled network formation. During this process, expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF165) was upregulated in co-cultured HBMSC. Meanwhile, VEGF165-receptor2 (KDR) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) were upregulated in co-cultured HUVEC. Functional studies show that neutralization of VEGF165 blocked the migration and the rearrangement of the cells and downregulated the expression of uPA and its receptor. Blocking of vascular endothelial-cadherin (VE-cad) did not affect the migration of co-cultured HUVEC but suppressed the self-assembled network formation. In conclusion, co-cultures upregulated the expression of VEGF165 in co-cultured HBMSC; VEGF165 then activated uPA in co-cultured HUVEC, which might be responsible for initiating the migration and the self-assembled network formation with the participation of VE-cad. All of these results indicated that only the direct contact of HBMSC and HUVEC and their respective dialogue are sufficient to stimulate secretion of soluble factors and to activate molecules that are critical for self-assembled network formation which show a great application potential for vascularization in tissue engineering."
https://openalex.org/W2068460047,"Upwelling systems are characterised by an intense primary biomass production in the surface (warmest) water after the outcrop of the bottom (coldest) water, which is rich in nutrients. Although it is known that the microbial assemblage plays an important role in the food chain of marine systems and that the upwelling systems that occur in southwest Brazil drive the complex dynamics of the food chain, little is known about the microbial composition present in this region.We carried out a molecular survey based on SSU rRNA gene from the three domains of the phylogenetic tree of life present in a tropical upwelling region (Arraial do Cabo, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). The aim was to analyse the horizontal and vertical variations of the microbial composition in two geographically close areas influenced by anthropogenic activity (sewage disposal/port activity) and upwelling phenomena, respectively. A lower estimated diversity of microorganisms of the three domains of the phylogenetic tree of life was found in the water of the area influenced by anthropogenic activity compared to the area influenced by upwelling phenomena. We observed a heterogenic distribution of the relative abundance of taxonomic groups, especially in the Archaea and Eukarya domains. The bacterial community was dominated by Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria and Bacteroidetes phyla, whereas the microeukaryotic community was dominated by Metazoa, Fungi, Alveolata and Stramenopile. The estimated archaeal diversity was the lowest of the three domains and was dominated by uncharacterised marine Crenarchaeota that were most closely related to Marine Group I.The variety of conditions and the presence of different microbial assemblages indicated that the area of Arraial do Cabo can be used as a model for detailed studies that contemplate the correlation between pollution-indicating parameters and the depletion of microbial diversity in areas close to anthropogenic activity; functional roles and geochemical processes; phylogeny of the uncharacterised diversity; and seasonal variations of the microbial assemblages."
https://openalex.org/W2065206097,"Bacillus subtilis two-component system DegS/U is well known for the complexity of its regulation. The cytosolic sensory kinase DegS does not receive a single predominant input signal like most two-component kinases, instead it integrates a wide array of metabolic inputs that modulate its activity. The phosphorylation state of the response regulator DegU also does not confer a straightforward “on/off” response; it is fine-tuned and at different levels triggers different sub-regulons. Here we describe serine phosphorylation of the DegS sensing domain, which stimulates its kinase activity. We demonstrate that DegS phosphorylation can be carried out by at least two B. subtilis Hanks-type kinases in vitro, and this stimulates the phosphate transfer towards DegU. The consequences of this process were studied in vivo, using phosphomimetic (Ser76Asp) and non-phosphorylatable (Ser76Ala) mutants of DegS. In a number of physiological assays focused on different processes regulated by DegU, DegS S76D phosphomimetic mutant behaved like a strain with intermediate levels of DegU phosphorylation, whereas DegS S76A behaved like a strain with lower levels of DegU phophorylation. These findings suggest a link between DegS phosphorylation at serine 76 and the level of DegU phosphorylation, establishing this post-translational modification as an additional trigger for this two-component system."

Stress was induced by means of a psychological computer-test. The test-meal was either a high-protein meal (En% P/C/F 65/5/30) or a high-carbohydrate meal (En% P/C/F 6/64/30), both meals were matched for energy density (4 kJ/g) and daily energy requirements (30%). Per test-session salivary cortisol levels, appetite profile, mood state and level of anxiety were measured. High hunger, low satiety (81 ± 16, 12 ± 15 mm VAS) confirmed the fasted state. The stress condition was confirmed by increased feelings of depression, tension, anger, anxiety (AUC stress vs. rest p < 0.02). Consumption of the high-protein vs. high-carbohydrate meal did not affect feelings of depression, tension, anger, anxiety. Cortisol levels did not differ between the four test-sessions in men and women (AUC nmol·min/L p > 0.1). Consumption of the test-meals increased cortisol levels in men in all conditions (p < 0.01), and in women in the rest-protein and stress-protein condition (p < 0.03). Men showed higher cortisol levels than women (AUC nmol·min/L p < 0.0001). Consumption of meals with different macronutrient contents, i.e. high-protein vs. high-carbohydrate, does not influence the physiological and psychological response differentially. Men show a higher meal-induced salivary cortisol response compared with women."
https://openalex.org/W2094843557,"The ventral tegmental area (VTA) plays an essential role in reward and motivation. How the dopamine (DA) and non-DA neurons in the VTA engage in motivation-based locomotor behaviors is not well understood. We recorded activity of putative DA and non-DA neurons simultaneously in the VTA of awake mice engaged in motivated voluntary movements such as wheel running. Our results revealed that VTA non-DA neurons exhibited significant rhythmic activity that was correlated with the animal's running rhythms. Activity of putative DA neurons also correlated with the movement behavior, but to a lesser degree. More importantly, putative DA neurons exhibited significant burst activation at both onset and offset of voluntary movements. These findings suggest that VTA DA and non-DA neurons conjunctively process locomotor-related motivational signals that are associated with movement initiation, maintenance and termination."
https://openalex.org/W1994482345,"Development of effective vaccines to prevent influenza, particularly highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) caused by influenza A virus (IAV) subtype H5N1, is a challenging goal. In this study, we designed and constructed two recombinant influenza vaccine candidates by fusing hemagglutinin 1 (HA1) fragment of A/Anhui/1/2005(H5N1) to either Fc of human IgG (HA1-Fc) or foldon plus Fc (HA1-Fdc), and evaluated their immune responses and cross-protection against divergent strains of H5N1 virus. Results showed that these two recombinant vaccines induced strong immune responses in the vaccinated mice, which specifically reacted with HA1 proteins and an inactivated heterologous H5N1 virus. Both proteins were able to cross-neutralize infections by one homologous strain (clade 2.3) and four heterologous strains belonging to clades 0, 1, and 2.2 of H5N1 pseudoviruses as well as three heterologous strains (clades 0, 1, and 2.3.4) of H5N1 live virus. Importantly, immunization with these two vaccine candidates, especially HA1-Fdc, provided complete cross-clade protection against high-dose lethal challenge of different strains of H5N1 virus covering clade 0, 1, and 2.3.4 in the tested mouse model. This study suggests that the recombinant fusion proteins, particularly HA1-Fdc, could be developed into an efficacious universal H5N1 influenza vaccine, providing cross-protection against infections by divergent strains of highly pathogenic H5N1 virus."
https://openalex.org/W1976740713,"Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) caused by the superantigen exotoxins of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes is characterized by robust T cell activation, profound elevation in systemic levels of multiple cytokines, including interferon-γ (IFN-γ), followed by multiple organ dysfunction and often death. As IFN-γ possesses pro- as well as anti-inflammatory properties, we delineated its role in the pathogenesis of TSS. Antibody-mediated in vivo neutralization of IFN-γ or targeted disruption of IFN-γ gene conferred significant protection from lethal TSS in HLA-DR3 transgenic mice. Following systemic high dose SEB challenge, whereas the HLA-DR3.IFN-γ(+/+) mice became sick and succumbed to TSS, HLA-DR3.IFN-γ(-/-) mice appeared healthy and were significantly protected from SEB-induced lethality. SEB-induced systemic cytokine storm was significantly blunted in HLA-DR3.IFN-γ(-/-) transgenic mice. Serum concentrations of several cytokines (IL-4, IL-10, IL-12p40 and IL-17) and chemokines (KC, rantes, eotaxin and MCP-1) were significantly lower in HLA-DR3.IFN-γ(-/-) transgenic mice. However, SEB-induced T cell expansion in the spleens was unaffected and expansion of SEB-reactive TCR Vβ8(+) CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells was even more pronounced in HLA-DR3.IFN-γ(-/-) transgenic mice when compared to HLA-DR3.IFN-γ(+/+) mice. A systematic histopathological examination of several vital organs revealed that both HLA-DR3.IFN-γ(+/+) and HLA-DR3.IFN-γ(-/-) transgenic mice displayed comparable severe inflammatory changes in lungs, and liver during TSS. Remarkably, whereas the small intestines from HLA-DR3.IFN-γ(+/+) transgenic mice displayed significant pathological changes during TSS, the architecture of small intestines in HLA-DR3.IFN-γ(-/-) transgenic mice was preserved. In concordance with these histopathological changes, the gut permeability to macromolecules was dramatically increased in HLA-DR3.IFN-γ(+/+) but not HLA-DR3.IFN-γ(-/-) mice during TSS. Overall, IFN-γ seemed to play a lethal role in the immunopathogenesis of TSS by inflicting fatal small bowel pathology. Our study thus identifies the important role for IFN-γ in TSS."

This study was performed to determine if Ad2F would enhance the nasal immunogenicity of Hcβtre in rabbits, an animal model with a nasal cavity anatomy similar to humans. Since CT is not safe for human use, we also tested the adjuvant activity of compound 48/80 (C48/80), a mast cell activating compound previously determined to safely exhibit nasal adjuvant activity in mice.New Zealand White or Dutch Belted rabbits were nasally immunized with Hcβtre or Hcβtre-Ad2F alone or combined with CT or C48/80, and serum samples were tested for the presence of Hcβtre-specific binding (ELISA) or BoNT/A neutralizing antibodies.Hcβtre-Ad2F nasally administered with CT induced serum anti-Hcβtre IgG ELISA and BoNT/A neutralizing antibody titers greater than those induced by Hcβtre + CT. C48/80 provided significant nasal adjuvant activity and induced BoNT/A-neutralizing antibodies similar to those induced by CT.Ad2F enhanced the nasal immunogenicity of Hcβtre, and the mast cell activator C48/80 was an effective adjuvant for nasal immunization in rabbits, an animal model with a nasal cavity anatomy similar to that in humans."

Here, we investigate the role of Zhenjiang city of Jiangsu province, an important transportation hub linking Shanghai with other regions of China, in HCV transmission.A total of 141 whole blood samples were collected from injection drug users (IDUs) in Zhenjiang and then tested for HCV infection. Of them, 115 HCV positive plasmas were subjected to RNA extraction, RT-PCR amplification, and sequencing. The subtype characterization and the evolutionary origin of HCV strains circulating in Zhenjiang were determined using polygenetic or phylogeographic analyses. Seven HCV subtypes 1b, 2a, 3a, 3b, 6a, 6e and 6n were detected among Zhenjiang IDUs, showing a complex HCV epidemic. The most predominant subtypes were 3a (38%) and 1b (26.8%). Among these subtypes, subtypes 3b, 6n and 6e originated from Southwestern China (i.e., Yunnan and/or Guangxi), subtypes 2a and 6a from Southern China (i.e., Guangdong), subtype 1b from Central (i.e., Henan) and Northwestern (i.e., Xinjiang) China, and subtype 3a from Southwestern (i.e., Yunnan) and Northwestern (i.e., Xinjiang) China. From Zhenjiang, subtypes 1b and 2a were further spread to Eastern (i.e., Shanghai) and Northern (i.e., Beijing) China, respectively.The mixing of seven HCV subtypes in Zhenjiang from all quarters of China indicates that as an important middle station, Zhenjiang plays a crucial role in HCV transmission, just as it is important in population migration between other regions of China and Eastern China."
https://openalex.org/W2066180307,"Preconditioning environments or therapeutics, to suppress the cellular damage associated with severe oxygen deprivation, is of interest to our understanding of diseases associated with oxygen deprivation. Wildtype C. elegans exposed to anoxia enter into a state of suspended animation in which energy-requiring processes reversibly arrest. C. elegans at all developmental stages survive 24-hours of anoxia exposure however, the ability of adult hermaphrodites to survive three days of anoxia significantly decreases. Mutations in the insulin-like signaling receptor (daf-2) and LIN-12/Notch (glp-1) lead to an enhanced long-term anoxia survival phenotype.In this study we show that the combined growth environment of 25°C and a diet of HT115 E. coli will precondition adult hermaphrodites to survive long-term anoxia; many of these survivors have normal movement after anoxia treatment. Animals fed the drug metformin, which induces a dietary-restriction like state in animals and activates AMPK in mammalian cell culture, have a higher survival rate when exposed to long-term anoxia. Mutations in genes encoding components of AMPK (aak-2, aakb-1, aakb-2, aakg-2) suppress the environmentally and genetically induced long-term anoxia survival phenotype. We further determine that there is a correlation between the animals that survive long-term anoxia and increased levels of carminic acid staining, which is a fluorescent dye that incorporates in with carbohydrates such as glycogen.We conclude that small changes in growth conditions such as increased temperature and food source can influence the physiology of the animal thus affecting the responses to stress such as anoxia. Furthermore, this supports the idea that metformin should be further investigated as a therapeutic tool for treatment of oxygen-deprived tissues. Finally, the capacity for an animal to survive long bouts of severe oxygen deprivation is likely dependent on specific subunits of the heterotrimeric protein AMPK and energy stores such as carbohydrates."
https://openalex.org/W1964994815,"Numerous Gram negative pathogens possess a type III secretion system (T3SS) which allows them to inject virulent proteins directly into the eukaryotic cell cytoplasm. Injection of these proteins is dependent on a variable secretion signal sequence. In this study, we utilized the N-terminal secretion signal sequence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin ExoS to translocate Cre recombinase containing a nuclear localization sequence (Cre-NLS). Transient exposure of human sarcoma cell line, containing Cre-dependent lacZ reporter, resulted in efficient recombination in the host chromosome, indicating that the bacterially delivered protein was not only efficiently localized to the nucleus but also retained its biological function. Using this system, we also illustrate the ability of P. aeruginosa to infect mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC) and the susceptibility of these cells to bacterially delivered Cre-NLS. A single two-hour infection caused as high as 30% of the mESC reporter cells to undergo loxP mediated chromosomal DNA recombination. A simple antibiotic treatment completely eliminated the bacterial cells following the delivery, while the use of an engineered mutant strain greatly reduced cytotoxicity. Utility of the system was demonstrated by delivery of the Cre-NLS to induced pluripotent stem cells to excise the floxed oncogenic nuclear reprogramming cassette. These results validate the use of T3SS for the delivery of transcription factors for the purpose of cellular reprogramming."
https://openalex.org/W1972747890,"Ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs) are toxic N-glycosidases that depurinate the universally conserved α-sarcin loop of large rRNAs. They have received attention in biological and biomedical research because of their unique biological activities toward animals and human cells as cell-killing agents. A better understanding of the depurination mechanism of RIPs could allow us to develop potent neutralizing antibodies and to design efficient immunotoxins for clinical use. Among these RIPs, ricin exhibited remarkable efficacy in depurination activity and highly conserved tertiary structure with other RIPs. It can be considered as a prototype to investigate the depurination mechanism of RIPs. In the present study, we successfully identified a novel functional domain responsible for controlling the depurination activity of ricin, which is located far from the enzymatic active site reported previously. Our study indicated that ricin A-chain mAbs binding to this domain (an α-helix comprising the residues 99-106) exhibited an unusual potent neutralizing ability against ricin in vivo. To further investigate the potential role of the α-helix in regulating the catalytic activity of ricin, ricin A-chain variants with different flexibility of the α-helix were rationally designed. Our data clearly demonstrated that the flexibility of the α-helix is responsible for controlling the depurination activity of ricin and determining the extent of protein synthesis inhibition, suggesting that the conserved α-helix might be considered as a potential target for the prevention and treatment of RIP poisoning."

Recently, a polymorphism in the promoter of BIRC5, -31C/G (rs9904341), was shown to influence BIRC5 expression.We examined whether the -31C/G was related to the risk of developing nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in a case-control population from Guangxi province in southern China, which consists of 855 patients with NPC and 1036 controls. This polymorphism was genotyped by TaqMan assay. The genetic associations with the occurrence and progression of NPC were estimated by logistic regression.We observed a statistically significant increased occurrence of NPC associated with the CC genotype (odds ratio [OR], 1.40; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13-1.73; P=0.0020) compared with the genotypes containing G allele (CG + GG genotype). However, no significant association was observed for the -31C/G with the severity of NPC (as measured by tumor-node-metastasis staging system).Our findings suggest that the functional polymorphism -31C/G in the promoter of BIRC5 gene may play a role in mediating the susceptibility to NPC among Chinese."
https://openalex.org/W2038950626,"Previous studies have demonstrated that maternal ethanol exposure induces a moderate increase in Nrf2 protein expression in mouse embryos. Pretreatment with the Nrf2 inducer, 3H-1, 2-dithiole-3-thione (D3T), significantly increases the Nrf2 protein levels and prevents apoptosis in ethanol-exposed embryos. The present study, using PC12 cells, was designed to determine whether increased Nrf2 stability is a mechanism by which D3T enhances Nrf2 activation and subsequent antioxidant protection. Ethanol and D3T treatment resulted in a significant accumulation of Nrf2 protein in PC 12 cells. CHX chase analysis has shown that ethanol treatment delayed the degradation of Nrf2 protein in PC12 cells. A significantly greater decrease in Nrf2 protein degradation was observed in the cells treated with D3T alone or with both ethanol and D3T. In addition, D3T treatment significantly reduced ethanol-induced apoptosis. These results demonstrate that the stabilization of Nrf2 protein by D3T confers protection against ethanol-induced apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2116806141,"Membrane phosphatidylcholine homeostasis is maintained in part by a sensing device in the key regulatory enzyme, CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT). CCT responds to decreases in membrane phosphatidylcholine content by reversible membrane binding and activation. Two prominent isoforms, CCTα and -β2, have nearly identical catalytic domains and very similar membrane binding amphipathic helical (M) domains but have divergent and structurally disordered N-terminal (N) and C-terminal phosphorylation (P) regions. We found that the binding affinity of purified CCTβ2 for anionic membranes was weaker than CCTα by more than an order of magnitude. Using chimeric CCTs, insertion/deletion mutants, and truncated CCTs, we show that the stronger affinity of CCTα can be attributed in large part to the electrostatic membrane binding function of the polybasic nuclear localization signal (NLS) motif, present in the unstructured N-terminal segment of CCTα but lacking in CCTβ2. The membrane partitioning of CCTβ2 in cells enriched with the lipid activator, oleic acid, was also weaker than that of CCTα and was elevated by incorporation of the NLS motif. Thus, the polybasic NLS can function as a secondary membrane binding motif not only in vitro but in the context of cell membranes. A comparison of phosphorylated, dephosphorylated, and region P-truncated forms showed that the in vitro membrane affinity of CCTβ2 is more sensitive than CCTα to phosphorylation status, which antagonizes membrane binding of both isoforms. These data provide a model wherein the primary membrane binding motif, an amphipathic helical domain, works in collaboration with other intrinsically disordered segments that modulate membrane binding strength. The NLS reinforces, whereas the phosphorylated tail antagonizes the attraction of domain M for anionic membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1970953856,"Culturing is an indispensable technique in microbiological research, and culturing with selective media has played a crucial role in the detection of pathogenic microorganisms and the isolation of commercially useful microorganisms from environmental samples. Although numerous selective media have been developed in empirical studies, unintended microorganisms often grow on such media probably due to the enormous numbers of microorganisms in the environment. Here, we present a novel strategy for designing highly selective media based on two selective agents, a carbon source and antimicrobials. We named our strategy SMART for highly Selective Medium-design Algorithm Restricted by Two constraints. To test whether the SMART method is applicable to a wide range of microorganisms, we developed selective media for Burkholderia glumae, Acidovorax avenae, Pectobacterium carotovorum, Ralstonia solanacearum, and Xanthomonas campestris. The series of media developed by SMART specifically allowed growth of the targeted bacteria. Because these selective media exhibited high specificity for growth of the target bacteria compared to established selective media, we applied three notable detection technologies: paper-based, flow cytometry-based, and color change-based detection systems for target bacteria species. SMART facilitates not only the development of novel techniques for detecting specific bacteria, but also our understanding of the ecology and epidemiology of the targeted bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2042886209,"Background Several B-cell defects arise in HIV infected patients, particularly in patients with chronic infection and high viral load. Loss of memory B cells (CD27+ B cells) in peripheral blood and lymphoid tissues is one of the major B cell dysfunctions in HIV and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection. Despite several studies, definitive identification of memory B cells based on CD27 surface expression has not been described. Similarly, the rates of cell turnover in different B cell subpopulation from lymphoid and mucosal tissues have not been well documented. In this study, we demonstrate the presence of memory B cell populations and define their distribution, frequency and immunophenotype with regards to activation, proliferation, maturation, and antibody production in normal rhesus macaques from different lymphoid tissues. Methodology/Principal Findings Thirteen healthy, uninfected rhesus macaques were selected for this study. CD20+ B cells were isolated from peripheral blood and sorted based on CD27 and CD21 surface markers to define memory B cell population. All the B cell subpopulation was further characterized phenotypically and their cell turnover rates were evaluated in vivo following bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) inoculation. Double positive (DP) CD21+CD27+ B cells in both peripheral and lymphoid tissues are memory B cells, able to produce antibody by polyclonal activation, and without T cell help. Peripheral and lymphoid DP CD21+CD27+ B cells were also able to become activated and proliferate at higher rates than other B cell subpopulations. Increased turnover of tonsillar memory B cells were identified compared to other tissues examined. Conclusions/Significance We suggest that this DP memory B cells play a major role in the immune system and their function and proliferation might have an important role in HIV/SIV mediated B cell dysregulation and pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2046307275,"Dedifferentiation of muscle cells in the tissue of mammals has yet to be observed. One of the challenges facing the study of skeletal muscle cell dedifferentiation is the availability of a reliable model that can confidentially distinguish differentiated cell populations of myotubes and non-fused mononuclear cells, including stem cells that can coexist within the population of cells being studied.In the current study, we created a Cre/Lox-β-galactosidase system, which can specifically tag differentiated multinuclear myotubes and myotube-generated mononuclear cells based on the activation of the marker gene, β-galactosidase. By using this system in an adult mouse model, we found that β-galactosidase positive mononuclear cells were generated from β-galactosidase positive multinuclear myofibers upon muscle injury. We also demonstrated that these mononuclear cells can develop into a variety of different muscle cell lineages, i.e., myoblasts, satellite cells, and muscle derived stem cells.These novel findings demonstrated, for the first time, that cellular dedifferentiation of skeletal muscle cells actually occurs in mammalian skeletal muscle following traumatic injury in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2089605616,"Background DevR (also called as DosR) is a two-domain response regulator of the NarL subfamily that controls dormancy adaptation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb). In response to inducing signals such as hypoxia and ascorbic acid, the N-terminal receiver domain of DevR (DevRN) is phosphorylated at Asp54. This results in DevR binding to DNA via its C-terminal domain (DevRC) and subsequent induction of the DevR regulon. The mechanism of phosphorylation-mediated activation is not known. The present study was designed to understand the role of the N- and C-terminal domains of DevR in DevR regulon genes activation. Methodology/Principal Findings Towards deciphering the activation mechanism of DevR, we compared the DNA binding properties of DevRC and DevR and correlated the findings with their ability to activate gene expression. We show that isolated DevRC can interact with DNA, but only with the high affinity site of a representative target promoter. Therefore, one role of DevRN is to mask the intrinsic DNA binding function of DevRC. However, unlike phosphorylated DevR, isolated DevRC does not interact with the adjacent low affinity binding site suggesting that a second role of DevRN is in cooperative binding to the secondary site. Transcriptional analysis shows that consistent with unmasking of its DNA binding property, DevRC supports the aerobic induction, albeit feebly, of DevR regulon genes but is unable to sustain gene activation during hypoxia. Conclusions/Significance DevR is a unique response regulator that employs a dual activation mechanism including relief of inhibition and cooperative interaction with binding sites. Importantly, both these functions reside outside the C-terminal domain. DevRN is also essential for stabilizing DevR and sustaining autoregulation under hypoxia. Hence, both domains of DevR are required for robust transcription activation."
https://openalex.org/W1977971213,"Insulators are DNA sequences thought to be important for the establishment and maintenance of cell-type specific nuclear architecture. In Drosophila there are several classes of insulators that appear to have unique roles in gene expression. The mechanisms involved in determining and regulating the specific roles of these insulator classes are not understood. Here we report that DNA Topoisomerase II modulates the activity of the Su(Hw) insulator. Downregulation of Topo II by RNAi or mutations in the Top2 gene result in disruption of Su(Hw) insulator function. This effect is mediated by the Mod(mdg4)2.2 protein, which is a unique component of the Su(Hw) insulator complex. Co-immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid experiments show that Topo II and Mod(mdg4)2.2 proteins directly interact. In addition, mutations in Top2 cause a slight decrease of Mod(mdg4)2.2 transcript but have a dramatic effect on Mod(mdg4)2.2 protein levels. In the presence of proteasome inhibitors, normal levels of Mod(mdg4)2.2 protein and its binding to polytene chromosomes are restored. Thus, Topo II is required to prevent Mod(mdg4)2.2 degradation and, consequently, to stabilize Su(Hw) insulator-mediated chromatin organization."
https://openalex.org/W1991123855,"Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) can induce Bad-mediated apoptosis followed by secondary necrosis in fish cells, but it is not known how these two types of cell death are regulated by IPNV. We found that IPNV infection can regulate Bad/Bid-mediated apoptotic and Rip1/ROS-mediated necrotic death pathways via the up-regulation of TNFα in zebrafish ZF4 cells. Using a DNA microarray and quantitative RT-PCR analyses, two major subsets of differentially expressed genes were characterized, including the innate immune response gene TNFα and the pro-apoptotic genes Bad and Bid. In the early replication stage (0–6 h post-infection, or p.i.), we observed that the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNFα underwent a rapid six-fold induction. Then, during the early-middle replication stages (6–12 h p.i.), TNFα level was eight-fold induction and the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members Bad and Bid were up-regulated. Furthermore, specific inhibitors of TNFα expression (AG-126 or TNFα-specific siRNA) were used to block apoptotic and necrotic death signaling during the early or early-middle stages of IPNV infection. Inhibition of TNFα expression dramatically reduced the Bad/Bid-mediated apoptotic and Rip1/ROS-mediated necrotic cell death pathways and rescued host cell viability. Moreover, we used Rip1-specific inhibitors (Nec-1 and Rip1-specific siRNA) to block Rip1 expression. The Rip1/ROS-mediated secondary necrotic pathway appeared to be reduced in IPNV-infected fish cells during the middle-late stage of infection (12–18 h p.i.). Taken together, our results indicate that IPNV triggers two death pathways via up-stream induction of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNFα, and these results may provide new insights into the pathogenesis of RNA viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2019718689,"Cone photoreceptors mediate visual acuity under daylight conditions, so loss of cone-mediated central vision of course dramatically affects the quality of life of patients suffering from retinal degeneration. Therefore, promoting cone survival has become the goal of many ocular therapies and defining the stage of degeneration that still allows cell rescue is of prime importance. Using the Rpe65(R91W/R91W) mouse, which carries a mutation in the Rpe65 gene leading to progressive photoreceptor degeneration in both patients and mice, we defined stages of retinal degeneration that still allow cone rescue. We evaluated the therapeutic window within which cones can be rescued, using a subretinal injection of a lentiviral vector driving expression of RPE65 in the Rpe65(R91W/R91W) mice. Surprisingly, when applied to adult mice (1 month) this treatment not only stalls or slows cone degeneration but, actually, induces cone-specific protein expression that was previously absent. Before the intervention only part of the cones (40% of the number found in wild-type animals) in the Rpe65(R91W/R91W) mice expressed cone transducin (GNAT2); this fraction increased to 64% after treatment. Correct S-opsin localization is also recovered in the transduced region. In consequence these results represent an extended therapeutic window compared to the Rpe65(-/-) mice, implying that patients suffering from missense mutations might also benefit from a prolonged therapeutic window. Moreover, cones are not only rescued during the course of the degeneration, but can actually recover their initial status, meaning that a proportion of altered cones in chromophore deficiency-related disease can be rehabilitated even though they are severely affected."
https://openalex.org/W2051550302,"Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) is due to autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta-cells. Previously, we have shown that intravenously administered bone marrow-derived multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) allows pancreatic islet recovery, improves insulin secretion and reverts hyperglycemia in low doses streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice. Here we evaluate whether insulin prophylaxis and the administration of a second dose of cells affect the antidiabetic therapeutic effect of MSC transplantation. Insulitis and subsequent elimination of pancreatic beta-cells was promoted in C57BL/6 mice by the injection of 40 mg/kg/day STZ for five days. Twenty-four days later, diabetic mice were distributed into experimental groups according to if they received or not insulin and/or one or two doses of healthy donor-derived MSCs. Three and half months later: glycemia, pancreatic islets number, insulinemia, glycated hemoglobin level and glucose tolerance were determined in animals that did not received exogenous insulin for the last 1.5 months. Also, we characterized MSCs isolated from mice healthy or diabetic. The therapeutic effect of MSC transplantation was observed in diabetic mice that received or not insulin prophylaxis. Improvements were similar irrespective if they received one or two doses of cells. Compared to MSCs from healthy mice, MSCs from diabetic mice had the same proliferation and adipogenic potentials, but were less abundant, with altered immunophenotype and no osteogenic potential. Our preclinical results should be taken into account when designing phase II clinical trials aimed to evaluate MSC transplantation in patients with T1D. Cells should be isolated form healthy donor, insulin prophylaxis could be maintained and a second dose, after an elapse of two months, appears unnecessary in the medium-term."
https://openalex.org/W1970867377,"Thioredoxins comprise a conserved family of redox regulators involved in many biological processes, including stress resistance and aging. We report that the C. elegans thioredoxin TRX-1 acts in ASJ head sensory neurons as a novel modulator of the insulin-like neuropeptide DAF-28 during dauer formation. We show that increased formation of stress-resistant, long-lived dauer larvae in mutants for the gene encoding the insulin-like neuropeptide DAF-28 requires TRX-1 acting in ASJ neurons, upstream of the insulin-like receptor DAF-2. Genetic rescue experiments demonstrate that redox-independent functions of TRX-1 specifically in ASJ neurons are needed for the dauer formation constitutive (Daf-c) phenotype of daf-28 mutants. GFP reporters of trx-1 and daf-28 show opposing expression patterns in dauers (i.e. trx-1 is up-regulated and daf-28 is down-regulated), an effect that is not observed in growing L2/L3 larvae. In addition, functional TRX-1 is required for the down-regulation of a GFP reporter of daf-28 during dauer formation, a process that is likely subject to DAF-28-mediated feedback regulation. Our findings demonstrate that TRX-1 modulates DAF-28 signaling by contributing to the down-regulation of daf-28 expression during dauer formation. We propose that TRX-1 acts as a fluctuating neuronal signaling modulator within ASJ neurons to monitor the adjustment of neuropeptide expression, including insulin-like proteins, during dauer formation in response to adverse environmental conditions."

Xylanase is crucial for hemicellulose hydrolysis and plays an important role in the plant cell wall degradation. Xylanases of ruminal strains were widely studied, but few studies have focused on their diversity in rumen microenvironment.We explored the genetic diversity of xylanases belonging to two major glycosyl hydrolase families (GH 10 and 11) in goat rumen contents by analyzing the amplicons generated with two degenerate primer sets. Fifty-two distinct GH 10 and 35 GH 11 xylanase gene fragments (similarity <95%) were retrieved, and most had low identities with known sequences. Based on phylogenetic analysis, all GH 10 xylanase sequences fell into seven clusters, and 88.5% of them were related to xylanases from Bacteroidetes. Five clusters of GH 11 xylanase sequences were identified. Of these, 85.7% were related to xylanases from Firmicutes, and 14.3% were related to those of rumen fungi. Two full-length xylanase genes (one for each family) were directly cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Both the recombinant enzymes showed substantial xylanase activity, and were purified and characterized. Combined with the results of sheep rumen, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes are the two major phyla of xylan-degrading microorganisms in rumen, which is distinct from the representatives of other environments such as soil and termite hindgut, suggesting that xylan-degrading microorganisms are environment specific.The numerous new xylanase genes suggested the functional diversity of xylanase in the rumen microenvironment which may have great potential applications in industry and agriculture. The phylogenetic diversity and different distributions of xylanase genes will help us understand their roles in plant cell wall degradation in the rumen microenvironment."

In the current study we sought to evaluate the role of the tumor suppressor Pten in murine PSC neoplastic progression. Using eight functional assays that have previously been used to indicate PSC adaptation or transformation, Pten null embryonic stem cells (ESCs) failed to rate as significant in five of them. Instead, our data demonstrate that the loss of Pten causes the emergence of a small number of aggressive, teratoma-initiating embryonic carcinoma cells (ECCs) during differentiation in vitro, while the remaining 90–95% of differentiated cells are non-tumorigenic. Furthermore, our data show that the mechanism by which Pten null ECCs emerge in vitro and cause tumors in vivo is through increased survival and self-renewal, due to failed repression of the transcription factor Nanog."

Design To obtain a large number of pregnant women and others tested for HIV, we identified specimens tested at a national laboratory using Genetic Systems HIV-1/HIV-2 Plus O EIA from July 2007 to June 2008. Methods Specimens with EIA repeatedly reactive and Western blot-negative or indeterminate results were considered EIA false-positive. We compared the false-positive rate among uninfected pregnant women and others, adjusting for HIV prevalence. Among all reactive EIAs, we evaluated the proportion of false-positives, positive predictive value (PPV), and Western blot bands among indeterminates, by pregnancy status. Results HIV prevalence was 0.06% among 921,438 pregnant women and 1.34% among 1,103,961 others. The false-positive rate was lower for pregnant women than others (0.14% vs. 0.21%, odds ratio 0.65 [95% confidence interval 0.61, 0.70]). Pregnant women with reactive EIAs were more likely than others (p<0.01) to have Western blot-negative (52.9% vs. 9.8%) and indeterminate results (17.0% vs. 3.7%) and lower PPV (30% vs. 87%). The p24 band was detected more often among pregnant women (p<0.01). Conclusions False-positive HIV EIA results were rare and occurred less frequently among pregnant women than others. Pregnant women with reactive EIAs were more likely to have negative and indeterminate Western blot results due to lower HIV prevalence and higher p24 reactivity, respectively. Indeterminate results may complicate clinical management during pregnancy. Alternative methods are needed to rule out infection in persons with reactive EIAs from low prevalence populations."
https://openalex.org/W2089839439,"We had previously identified the mutant allele of apm1(+) that encodes a homolog of the mammalian µ1A subunit of the clathrin-associated adaptor protein-1 (AP-1) complex, and we demonstrated the role of Apm1 in Golgi/endosome trafficking, secretion, and vacuole fusion in fission yeast.In the present study, we isolated rho3(+), which encodes a Rho-family small GTPase, an important regulator of exocystosis, as a multicopy-suppressor of the temperature-sensitive growth of the apm1-1 mutant cells. Overexpression of Rho3 suppressed the Cl(-) sensitivity and immunosuppressant sensitivity of the apm1-1 mutant cells. Overexpression of Rho3 also suppressed the fragmentation of vacuoles, and the accumulation of v-SNARE Syb1 in Golgi/endosomes and partially suppressed the defective secretion associated with apm1-deletion cells. Notably, electron microscopic observation of the rho3-deletion cells revealed the accumulation of abnormal Golgi-like structures, vacuole fragmentation, and accumulation of secretory vesicles; these phenotypes were very similar to those of the apm1-deletion cells. Furthermore, the rho3-deletion cells and apm1-deletion cells showed very similar phenotypic characteristics, including the sensitivity to the immunosuppressant FK506, the cell wall-damaging agent micafungin, Cl(-), and valproic acid. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-Rho3 was localized at Golgi/endosomes as well as the plasma membrane and division site. Finally, Rho3 was shown to form a complex with Apm1 as well as with other subunits of the clathrin-associated AP-1 complex in a GTP- and effector domain-dependent manner.Taken together, our findings reveal a novel role of Rho3 in the regulation of Golgi/endosome trafficking and suggest that clathrin-associated adaptor protein-1 and Rho3 co-ordinate in intracellular transport in fission yeast. To the best of our knowledge, this study provides the first evidence of a direct link between the small GTPase Rho and the clathrin-associated adaptor protein-1 in membrane trafficking."
https://openalex.org/W1972925373,"Previous studies indicate that natural bispecific antibodies can be readily produced in vivo when the body is simultaneously stimulated with 2 distinct antigens. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) usually exhibit persistent immune responses to various autoantigens, raising the possibility that natural bispecific antibodies against 2 distinct autoantigens might exist.We identified the presence of natural bispecific antibodies against cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) in RA patients' sera by means of a double-antigen sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The spontaneous emergence of bispecific antibodies was confirmed by mixing different proportions of 1 anti-CCP-positive serum and 1 rheumatoid factor (RF)-positive serum in vitro. Among the tested samples, positive correlations were found between the presence of bispecific antibodies and both IgG4 anti-CCP antibodies and IgG4 RF (r = 0.507, p<0.001 and r = 0.249, p = 0.044, respectively), suggesting that the IgG4 subclass is associated with this phenomenon. Furthermore, bispecific antibodies were selectively generated when several anti-CCP- and RF-positive sera were mixed pairwise, indicating that factors other than the monospecific antibody titers may also contribute to the production of the natural bispecific antibodies.We successfully identified the presence of natural bispecific antibodies. Our results suggest that these antibodies originate from anti-CCP and RF in the sera of RA patients. The natural occurrence of bispecific antibodies in human diseases may provide new insights for a better understanding of the diseases. Further investigations are needed to elucidate their precise generation mechanisms and explore their clinical significance in disease development and progression in a larger study population."
https://openalex.org/W2092670240,"Neuroglobin (Ngb) is a recently discovered vertebrate globin that is expressed in the brain and can reversibly bind oxygen. Mammalian Ngb is involved in neuroprotection during oxidative stress that occurs, for example, during ischemia and reperfusion. Recently, we found that zebrafish, but not human, Ngb can translocate into cells. Moreover, we demonstrated that a chimeric ZHHH Ngb protein, in which the module M1 of human Ngb is replaced by the corresponding region of zebrafish Ngb, can penetrate cell membranes and protect cells against oxidative stress-induced cell death, suggesting that module M1 of zebrafish Ngb is important for protein transduction. Furthermore, we recently showed that Lys7, Lys9, Lys21, and Lys23 in module M1 of zebrafish Ngb are crucial for protein transduction activity. In the present study, we have investigated whether module M1 of zebrafish Ngb can be used as a building block to create novel cell-membrane-penetrating folded proteins. First, we engineered a chimeric myoglobin (Mb), in which module M1 of zebrafish Ngb was fused to the N-terminus of full-length human Mb, and investigated its functional and structural properties. Our results showed that this chimeric Mb protein is stable and forms almost the same heme environment and α-helical structure as human wild-type Mb. In addition, we demonstrated that chimeric Mb has a cell-membrane-penetrating activity similar to zebrafish Ngb. Moreover, we found that glycosaminoglycan is crucial for the cell-membrane-penetrating activity of chimeric Mb as well as that of zebrafish Ngb. These results enable us to conclude that such module substitutions will facilitate the design and production of novel functional proteins."

We compared the distributions of 81, 47, 79, and 98 introns in the fungal histone H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 genes, respectively. Based on the multiple alignments of the amino acid sequences of histones, we identified 19, 13, 31, and 22 intron insertion sites in the histone H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 genes, respectively. Surprisingly only one hot spot of introns in the histone H2A gene is shared between Basidiomycota and Perizomycotina, suggesting that most of introns of Basidiomycota and Perizomycotina were acquired independently. Our findings suggest that the common ancestor of Ascomycota and Basidiomycota maybe had a few introns in the histone genes. In the course of fungal evolution, Saccharomycotina and Taphrinomycotina lost the histone introns; Basidiomycota and Perizomycotina acquired other introns independently. In addition, most of the introns have sequence similarity among introns of phylogenetically close species, strongly suggesting that horizontal intron transfer events between phylogenetically distant species have not occurred recently in the fungal histone genes."
https://openalex.org/W2046314666,"Background It is anticipated that extreme population events, such as extinctions and outbreaks, will become more frequent as a consequence of climate change. To evaluate the increased probability of such events, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms involved. Variation between individuals in their response to climatic factors is an important consideration, especially if microevolution is expected to change the composition of populations. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we present data of a willow leaf beetle species, showing high variation among individuals in oviposition rate at a high temperature (20°C). It is particularly noteworthy that not all individuals responded to changes in temperature; individuals laying few eggs at 20°C continued to do so when transferred to 12°C, whereas individuals that laid many eggs at 20°C reduced their oviposition and laid the same number of eggs as the others when transferred to 12°C. When transferred back to 20°C most individuals reverted to their original oviposition rate. Thus, high variation among individuals was only observed at the higher temperature. Using a simple population model and based on regional climate change scenarios we show that the probability of outbreaks increases if there is a realistic increase in the number of warm summers. The probability of outbreaks also increased with increasing heritability of the ability to respond to increased temperature. Conclusions/Significance If climate becomes warmer and there is latent variation among individuals in their temperature response, the probability for outbreaks may increase. However, the likelihood for microevolution to play a role may be low. This conclusion is based on the fact that it has been difficult to show that microevolution affect the probability for extinctions. Our results highlight the urge for cautiousness when predicting the future concerning probabilities for extreme population events."
https://openalex.org/W2037244220,"The Sec translocase mediates the post-translational translocation of a number of preproteins through the inner membrane in bacteria. In the initiatory translocation step, SecB targets the preprotein to the translocase by specific interaction with its receptor SecA. The latter is the ATPase of Sec translocase which mediates the post-translational translocation of preprotein through the protein-conducting channel SecYEG in the bacterial inner membrane. We examined the structures of Escherichia coli Sec intermediates in solution as visualized by negatively stained electron microscopy in order to probe the oligomeric states of SecA during this process. The symmetric interaction pattern between the SecA dimer and SecB becomes asymmetric in the presence of proOmpA, and one of the SecA protomers predominantly binds to SecB/proOmpA. Our results suggest that during preprotein translocation, the two SecA protomers are different in structure and may play different roles."

However, how chemokine gradients are generated for signaling purposes is not understood. Sánchez-Alcañiz et al. and Wang et al. in this issue of Neuron now describe how the discovery of a new chemokine receptor called CXCR7 helps to provide answers to this question. Chemokine signaling is a key regulator of stem cell migration and development. However, how chemokine gradients are generated for signaling purposes is not understood. Sánchez-Alcañiz et al. and Wang et al. in this issue of Neuron now describe how the discovery of a new chemokine receptor called CXCR7 helps to provide answers to this question. Important publications describing the effects of cytokines in the nervous system are demanding increasing amounts of our attention these days. Consider, for example, the chemotactic cytokines or chemokines. These small proteins have been extensively studied because of their importance in regulating leukocyte migration and inflammation. Approximately 50 different chemokines have been shown to exist in higher vertebrates. These can be organized into four subfamilies based on structural considerations and, as far as we know, all their effects are transduced by a family of G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). In most instances, chemokines are not expressed at high concentrations, their expression being upregulated in association with an innate immune or inflammatory response. However, one chemokine does not fit this general description. Stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1, also called CXCL12) and its receptor CXCR4 are constitutively expressed at high levels in many tissues, including the nervous system (Li and Ransohoff, 2008Li M. Ransohoff R.M. Prog. Neurobiol. 2008; 84: 116-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Evolutionary considerations have indicated that CXCL12 is the most ancient chemokine and that it existed in animals prior to the development of a sophisticated immune system, suggesting that the original function of chemokine signaling had nothing to do with immunity (Huising et al., 2003Huising M.O. Stet R.J. Kruiswijk C.P. Savelkoul H.F. Lidy Verburg-van Kemenade B.M. Trends Immunol. 2003; 24: 307-313PubMed Google Scholar). The ancient function of CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling appears to involve regulating the migration and development of the stem cells that generate nearly every tissue (Miller et al., 2008Miller R.J. Banisadr G. Bhattacharyya B.J. J. Neuroimmunol. 2008; 198: 31-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Both CXCL12 and CXCR4 are highly expressed in the developing embryo, their distribution changing rapidly over time in association with the development of different structures. The overall importance of CXCR4 signaling during development has become abundantly clear from examination of CXCR4 knockout mice, which exhibit numerous phenotypes relating to the formation of nearly every tissue (Li and Ransohoff, 2008Li M. Ransohoff R.M. Prog. Neurobiol. 2008; 84: 116-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). CXCR4 signaling regulates the development of many structures in the brain and peripheral nervous system, including parts of the cerebellum, cortex, and hippocampus and the dorsal root and sympathetic ganglia. Regulation of stem cell function by CXCR4 signaling continues in adult structures such as the bone marrow and the neurogenic niches of the brain. Although there is a great deal of data clearly demonstrating the importance of CXCR4 signaling in the directed migration of stem cell populations in the developing nervous system, details as to how this is actually accomplished remain to be elucidated. How exactly are gradients of CXCL12 established and how is the chemokine concentration in the local stem cell microenviroment precisely regulated? Now two extensive papers published in this issue of Neuron (Sánchez-Alcañiz et al., 2011Sánchez-Alcañiz J.A. Haege S. Mueller W. Pia R. Mackay F. Schulz S. Lopez-Bendito G. Stumm R. Marin O. Neuron. 2011; 69 (this issue): 77-90Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, Wang et al., 2011Wang Y. Li G. Stanco A. Long J.E. Crawford D. Potter G.B. Pleasure S.J. Behrens T. Rubenstein J.L.R. Neuron. 2011; 69 (this issue): 61-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) reveal important details about these mechanisms and, specifically, how they help to explain the manner in which interneurons migrate into the developing cortex. The insights provided by these papers come from consideration of the properties of a recently described chemokine receptor known as CXCR7. CXCR7 is a member of a particular subgroup of chemokine receptors, which also include DARC, D6, and CCXCKR, whose properties are somewhat unusual for GPCRs because, even though they bind chemokines, they don't actually activate G proteins (Graham, 2009Graham G.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 2009; 39: 342-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). An examination of their sequences reveals that these receptors don't contain the amino acid motif that has been typically associated with the activation of G proteins by chemokine receptors. So, what do these proteins do? If they don't activate G proteins are they capable of alternative types of signaling? Nowadays the repertoire of known signaling pathways associated with GPCRs is truly immense and so non-G-protein-related functions can certainly be envisaged (Rajagopal et al., 2010aRajagopal S. Rajagopal K. Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2010; 9: 373-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Moreover, what exactly are their biological functions? One idea is that these molecules function as “decoy” receptors. That is to say they can bind chemokines and remove them from the external environment through receptor-mediated endocytosis, a property commonly associated with GPCRs. Once internalized by a decoy receptor, a particular chemokine may be degraded or even perhaps rereleased intact from another part of the cell—a process known as transcytosis. Previously, receptors like DARC and D6 have been shown to bind and internalize numerous chemokines—but not CXCL12. However, the great interest in CXCR7 is that it does bind CXCL12 with very high affinity. In fact, apart from the possibility that it can also bind CXCL11, CXCL12 appears to be its only ligand. So, does CXCR7 cooperate with CXCR4 in mediating CXCL12 signaling and, if so, how? One suggestion is that CXCR7 and CXCR4 form heterodimers modulating CXCR4 signaling which normally involves the activation of Gαi/o (Levoye et al., 2009Levoye A. Balabanian K. Baleux F. Bachelerie F. Lagane B. Blood. 2009; 113: 6085-6093Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) Another suggestion is that the two receptors signal through the activation of different pathway, which might then interact intracellularly at some level. Perhaps the major function of CXCR7 is indeed the removal of CXCL12 from the local environment so that signaling via the CXCR4 receptor can be more precisely defined. Several papers have demonstrated that CXCR7 can readily interact with the intracellular scaffold protein β-arrestin 2, which is associated with receptor endocytosis (Rajagopal et al., 2010bRajagopal S. Kim J. Ahn S. Craig S. Lam C.M. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 628-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Indeed, it has been observed that CXCR7 is normally localized intracellularly and that it rapidly shuttles between the cell surface and intracellular compartments (Luker et al., 2010Luker K.E. Steele J.M. Mihalko L.A. Ray P. Luker G.D. Oncogene. 2010; 29: 4599-4610Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Over the years the group of investigators represented by Wang et al., 2011Wang Y. Li G. Stanco A. Long J.E. Crawford D. Potter G.B. Pleasure S.J. Behrens T. Rubenstein J.L.R. Neuron. 2011; 69 (this issue): 61-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar have carefully defined the mechanisms by which the different populations of cortical GABAergic interneurons develop from their germinal zones. For example, progenitor cells localized in the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) express a variety of transcription factors that can be used to trace their migration and development. Deletion of the transcription factor Lhx6 from the pool of MGE progenitors substantially disrupts their normal path of migration into the cortex. An important question therefore is what are the genes downstream of such transcription factors that mediate the actual mechanics of interneuron migration? Previous publications have demonstrated that Lhx6 helps to control the expression of CXCR4 by migrating progenitors and that CXCR4 and Lhx6 knockout mice show similar defects in interneuron migration (Zhao et al., 2008Zhao Y. Flandin P. Long J.E. Cuesta M.D. Westphal H. Rubenstein J.L. J. Comp. Neurol. 2008; 510: 79-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). At the time when interneuron progenitors migrate from the MGE, CXCL12 is expressed in two locales in the developing cortex .The chemokine is strongly expressed in the meninges and also in a deeper location that corresponds to the subventricular zone (SVZ)/intermediate zone (IZ).CXCR4-expressing progenitors in the MGE form migratory streams attracted by these sources of CXCL12 and normally populate the marginal zone (MZ) and SVZ (Tiveron et al., 2006Tiveron M.C. Rossel M. Moepps B. Zhang Y.L. Seidenfaden R. Favor J. König N. Cremer H. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 13273-13278Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Disruption of CXCR4 signaling causes a failure of migrating interneurons to populate their normal destinations and results in overpopulation of the cortical plate (CP) region from which they are normally excluded. Early studies on the phenotypes of CXCR7 knockout mice did not report any abnormalities in nervous system development. However, the abundant expression of CXCR7 in the developing brain suggested that phenotypes might well be observed on closer inspection (Schönemeier et al., 2008Schönemeier B. Kolodziej A. Schulz S. Jacobs S. Hoellt V. Stumm R. J. Comp. Neurol. 2008; 510: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Indeed, the papers by Wang et al., 2011Wang Y. Li G. Stanco A. Long J.E. Crawford D. Potter G.B. Pleasure S.J. Behrens T. Rubenstein J.L.R. Neuron. 2011; 69 (this issue): 61-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar and Sánchez-Alcañiz et al., 2011Sánchez-Alcañiz J.A. Haege S. Mueller W. Pia R. Mackay F. Schulz S. Lopez-Bendito G. Stumm R. Marin O. Neuron. 2011; 69 (this issue): 77-90Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar both demonstrate that not only is CXCR7 coexpressed with CXCR4 in migrating MGE progenitors but also that deletion of CXCR7 produces a phenotype that appears virtually identical to that observed in CXCR4 deficient mice. In both CXCR4 and CXCR7 mutants, migrating Lhx6-expressing progenitors exhibit reduced tangential and increased radial migration resulting in their enhanced positioning in the CP at the expense of the MZ or SVZ. Such observations suggest that CXCR4/CXCR7 may cooperate in regulating interneuron migration—but how? Wang et al., 2011Wang Y. Li G. Stanco A. Long J.E. Crawford D. Potter G.B. Pleasure S.J. Behrens T. Rubenstein J.L.R. Neuron. 2011; 69 (this issue): 61-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar make several important observations that help in answering this question. In one experiment, they ectopically expressed CXCL12 in the cortex of control or mutant mice. In wild-type mice Lhx6-expressing progenitors migrated toward this ectopic source. On the other hand, no progenitor migration was observed in either CXCR7 or CXCR4 mutant mice, indicating that expression of both of these receptors is equally important for directed migration to occur. However, when the authors examined the migratory properties of individual mutant progenitors in cortical slices, they found that CXCR4 mutant cells were more motile and CXCR7 mutant cells were less motile than wild-type cells. Hence the authors conclude that the two receptors must have different, but interdependent, signaling consequences in directing progenitor migration. Further experiments indicated what these signaling pathways might be. It is well known that CXCR4 receptors signal via the pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive G proteins Gαi/o. Using a genetic manipulation for expressing PTX in migrating interneurons, Wang et al., 2011Wang Y. Li G. Stanco A. Long J.E. Crawford D. Potter G.B. Pleasure S.J. Behrens T. Rubenstein J.L.R. Neuron. 2011; 69 (this issue): 61-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar demonstrated that inhibition of Gαi/o in these cells produces the same phenotype as inhibiting CXCR4, further illustrating the importance of CXCR4 signaling. CXCR7 receptors can't activate Gαi/o but are able to signal via β-arrestin. As β-arrestin can act as a scaffold protein for intermediates of the MAP kinase pathway, this could represent a signaling option for these receptors. Indeed, Wang et al., 2011Wang Y. Li G. Stanco A. Long J.E. Crawford D. Potter G.B. Pleasure S.J. Behrens T. Rubenstein J.L.R. Neuron. 2011; 69 (this issue): 61-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar do demonstrate that CXCR7 can activate the MAP kinase pathway in migrating progenitors. The mechanism of CXCR4/CXCR7 cooperation is beautifully illuminated by the studies of Sánchez-Alcañiz et al., 2011Sánchez-Alcañiz J.A. Haege S. Mueller W. Pia R. Mackay F. Schulz S. Lopez-Bendito G. Stumm R. Marin O. Neuron. 2011; 69 (this issue): 77-90Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar. These authors also conclude that migrating interneurons express both CXCR4 and CXCR7 and that migration is dependent on both receptors. However, they make one further absolutely key observation. They show that migrating cells that lack CXCR7 in CXCR7 mutant mice also lack CXCR4 protein expression (the mRNA is still expressed).Why should CXCR4 disappear if CXCR7 is removed? Sánchez-Alcañiz et al., 2011Sánchez-Alcañiz J.A. Haege S. Mueller W. Pia R. Mackay F. Schulz S. Lopez-Bendito G. Stumm R. Marin O. Neuron. 2011; 69 (this issue): 77-90Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar show, and Wang et al., 2011Wang Y. Li G. Stanco A. Long J.E. Crawford D. Potter G.B. Pleasure S.J. Behrens T. Rubenstein J.L.R. Neuron. 2011; 69 (this issue): 61-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar also observe, that most of the CXCR7 in migrating interneurons is intracellular, something consistent with other papers in the literature. Sánchez-Alcañiz et al., 2011Sánchez-Alcañiz J.A. Haege S. Mueller W. Pia R. Mackay F. Schulz S. Lopez-Bendito G. Stumm R. Marin O. Neuron. 2011; 69 (this issue): 77-90Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar note that CXCR7 actively recycles between the membrane and the interior of the cell. It appears that CXCR7 is constantly involved in binding and internalizing CXCL12. Hence, as they predict, Sánchez-Alcañiz et al., 2011Sánchez-Alcañiz J.A. Haege S. Mueller W. Pia R. Mackay F. Schulz S. Lopez-Bendito G. Stumm R. Marin O. Neuron. 2011; 69 (this issue): 77-90Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar demonstrate that removal of CXCR7 produces a huge increase in the extracellular levels of CXCL12. Normally, when CXCL12 binds to CXCR4, in addition to G protein activation, it also produces receptor endocytosis and degradation. Hence, if the extracellular CXCL12 concentration is too high, it will trigger endocytosis and degradation of all of the CXCR4 in the cell. Viewed in this way, one can see that the important function for CXCR7 in these cells is to carefully titrate the concentration of CXCL12 in the local microenviroment so that just the right amount of signaling occurs. If CXCR7 disappears, then extracellular CXCL12 levels will be too high, overactivation of CXCR4 will occur and it will also disappear from the cell. Thus, removal of CXCR7 will result in the disappearance of CXCR4 and so this is why both kinds of mutant mice have the same phenotype—Q.E.D.! Both papers also demonstrate that CXCR7 is frequently expressed in the developing brain in the absence of CXCR4.The two sets of authors particularly note CXCR7 expression in immature projection neurons of the CP and in other areas that are typically avoided by migrating interneurons. This is also consistent with its proposed function as a decoy or scavenger receptor helping to shape gradients of CXCL12 that will determine paths for CXCR4-mediated chemotaxis. Clearly therefore, like all seasoned performers, CXCR7 is comfortable with a role either as a soloist or dancing a pas de deux with CXCR4. Overall, therefore, these two papers provide a detailed picture of how two chemokine receptors cooperate in enabling the successful migration of a specific group of neural progenitors in the developing brain. And, like all important investigations, they also raise numerous issues and questions. For example, what is the significance of CXCR7-induced MAP kinase activation or other types of cell signaling ? Is such signaling important in producing CXCR7-mediated effects in addition to its scavenging function? Wang et al., 2011Wang Y. Li G. Stanco A. Long J.E. Crawford D. Potter G.B. Pleasure S.J. Behrens T. Rubenstein J.L.R. Neuron. 2011; 69 (this issue): 61-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar demonstrate that this type of signaling occurs, but how it influences the role of CXCR7 is unclear given the phenotype produced by PTX activation in migrating neurons. In addition, the expression of CXCR7 occurs in cells outside the developing embryo, including in cancer cells, which are often viewed as cells undergoing a dysregulated form of development. Given the important role of CXCR4 signaling in the spread of cancer metastases (Teicher and Fricker, 2010Teicher B.A. Fricker S.P. Clin. Cancer Res. 2010; 16: 2927-2931Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar), the functions of proteins like CXCR7 that can powerfully modify CXCR4 signaling are clearly of mechanistic and potentially therapeutic importance. Indeed, it is now clear that the discovery of CXCR7 has added an entirely new dimension to our understanding of how CXCR4 functions during development and beyond.

Here we demonstrated that CXCR7 regulated interneuron migration autonomously, as well as nonautonomously through its expression in immature projection neurons. Migrating cortical interneurons coexpressed Cxcr4 and Cxcr7, and Cxcr7–/– and Cxcr4–/– mutants had similar defects in interneuron positioning. Ectopic CXCL12 expression and pharmacological blockade of CXCR4 in Cxcr7–/– mutants showed that both receptors were essential for responding to CXCL12 during interneuron migration.
