https://openalex.org/W2061738083,"Harmful conditions including heat shock, oxidative stress, UV, and so forth cause programmed cell death, whose triggering requires activation of the Jun N-terminal kinase, JNK. High levels of Hsp72, a heat-inducible member of Hsp70 family, protect cells against a variety of stresses by a mechanism that is unclear at present. Here we report that elevated levels of Hsp72 inhibit a signal transduction pathway leading to programmed cell death by preventing stress-induced activation of JNK. Stress-induced activation of another stress-kinase, p38 (HOG1), is also blocked when the level of Hsp72 is increased. Similarly, addition of a purified recombinant Hsp72 to a crude cell lysate reduced p38 kinase activation, while depletion of the whole family of Hsp70 proteins with a monoclonal antibody enhanced such activation. In addition, we have found that accumulation of abnormal proteins in cells upon incubation with amino acid analogs causes activation of JNK and p38 kinases, which can be prevented by overproduction of Hsp72. Taken together, these data suggest that, in regulation of JNK and p38 kinases, Hsp70 serves as a “sensor” of the build-up of abnormal proteins after heat shock and other stresses. The inhibitory effect of an increased level of Hsp70 on JNK appears to be a major contributor to acquired thermotolerance in mammalian cells.

This activation proceeds through a signal transduction pathway that involves the small GTP-binding proteins, MEK kinase, MEKK1, and dual-specificity kinases MKK3, MKK4 (SEK1), and MKK6, which in turn phosphorylate and activate JNK and p38 (4Minden A.

JNK was recently shown to be an essential component of a signal transduction pathway which leads to programmed cell death in response to certain stimuli, including stressful conditions (9Verheij M.

In fact, overproduction of a dominant negative mutant of JNK activating kinase, SEK1, inhibits programmed cell death in response to heat shock, UV irradiation, oxidative stress (9Verheij M. Bose R.

Another protein, which when overproduced enhances cell survival following exposure to a variety of stressful conditions, is Hsp72, a heat-inducible member of Hsp70 family. Indeed, overproduction of Hsp72 either by expression under the regulation of a strong promoter on a plasmid, or physiologically, by exposure of cells to a mild heat shock, leads to a dramatic protection against severe heat shock, UV irradiation, H2O2, and other harmful conditions and factors (13Li G.C.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Members of the Hsp70 protein family function as molecular chaperones in refolding of denatured polypeptides (17Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (3077) Google Scholar, 18Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3564) Google Scholar). In fact, overproduction of Hsp72 was shown to reduce stress-induced denaturation and aggregation of certain proteins (19Kampinga H.H. Brunsting J.F. Stege G.J. J Burgman P.W.J.J. Konings A.W.T. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 219: 536-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 20Kabakov A.E. Gabai V.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 217: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) that has led to the common assumption that refolding and antiaggregating activities of Hsp72 determine its role in cellular protection against stresses (21Georgopoulos C. Welch W.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 601-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar, 22Kampinga H.H. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 11-17PubMed Google Scholar). However, under some conditions the protective action of Hsp72 appears to be unrelated to its chaperoning activity. For example, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) causes cell death by the activation of a signal transduction pathway leading to apoptosis (23Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. Miyzono K. Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1988) Google Scholar). This apoptotic process can be prevented by overproduction of Hsp72 (24Jaattela M. Wissing D. Bauer P.A. Li G.C. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3507-3512Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), which therefore seems to interfere with the apoptotic program. Similarly TNF, exposure to high temperatures, and some other stresses cause activation of the apoptosis-triggering signal transduction pathways that include activation of JNK (9Verheij M. Bose R. Lin X.H. Yao B. Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Birrer M.J. Szabo E. Zon L.I. Kyriakis J.M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N.

Chem. 1996; 271: 31929-31936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). The protective action of Hsp72 in these circumstances may also involve direct interference with the apoptotic program. It should be noted, however, that upon exposure to extremely high temperatures, when cell death is not due to apoptosis, but to necrosis, the antiaggregating and protein refolding activities of Hsp72 may become critical for cell protection (20Kabakov A.E. Gabai V.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 217: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). At what step can Hsp72 interfere with the apoptotic program? We hypothesized that overproduction of Hsp72 inhibits activation of JNK by harmful conditions. This idea was tested on the U937 leukemia cell line, in which JNK activation appeared to be essential for the activation of apoptosis by heat shock, UV, and oxidative stress (9Verheij M. Bose R. Lin X.H. Yao B. Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Birrer M.J. Szabo E. Zon L.I. Kyriakis J.M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. Nature. 1996; 380: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1707) Google Scholar), and on the PEER lymphoid cell line, in which we overproduced Hsp72 under the control of tetracycline-regulated promotor. U937 and PEER human lymphoid tumor cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% (U937) or 20% (PEER) fetal bovine serum and were used for experiments while in the mid-log phase (3–7 × 105 cells/ml). PEER cells were stably transfected with plasmids encoding Hsp72 under the control of a tetracycline-regulated transactivator. Hsp72 was inserted as a first cistron in a dicistronic expression vector that contains the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene. In this construct synthesis of Hsp72 is repressed when grown in the presence of tetracycline, but removal of this antibiotic leads to rapid and efficient induction of Hsp72. Cells were incubated in the absence of tetracycline for 48 h in order to induce expression of Hsp72 and GFP. Cells that express GFP were selected with a cell sorter. These cells were viable and continued to grow normally when tetracycline was added to repress Hsp72 synthesis. 2 × 107 PEER cells were collected by centrifugation and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were resuspended in 0.4 ml of a hypotonic buffer that contained 10 mm Hepes, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mm EDTA (pH 7.4). After 15 min of swelling on ice, cells were disrupted on ice by 60 strokes in Dounce homogenizer, and a 0.2 volume of a buffer containing 50 mm Hepes and 250 mm KCl (pH 7.4) was added. Nuclei and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 500 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the lysate was returned to ice. Typically cell lysates prepared by this procedure contained 4–7 mg/ml protein. For determination of cell viability, 0.5 mg/ml of MTT (Sigma) was added to 100 ml of cell suspension (0.5 × 106 cells/ml in 96-well plates) for 4 h, and the formazan formed was dissolved in acidic 2-propanol; optical density was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader at 590 nm. The OD of formazan formed by control (untreated) cells was taken as 100%. PARP degradation was determined by Western blotting with anti-PARP polyclonal antibodies. JNK was assayed using glutathioneS-transferase-c-Jun protein as a substrate either in an in-gel assay or after immunoprecipitation with anti-JNK antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as described previously (25Sutherland C.L. Heath A.W. Pelech S.L. Young P.R. Gold M.R. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3381-3390PubMed Google Scholar). p38 kinase activity was determined by Western blotting with polyclonal antibodies (New England Biolabs) specifically reacting with the phosphorylated (active) form of p38. We first investigated the effect of enhanced levels of Hsp72 on activation of stress kinase and apoptosis in U937 cells. To raise the level of Hsp72, U937 cells were subjected to a mild heat shock (20 min at 43 °C), followed by a 6-h recovery. Such mild heat shock caused only a weak transient activation of JNK and did not activate an apoptotic program (not shown). The second, severe, heat shock (60 min at 43 °C) was applied, and it caused death of about 70% of the cell population (Fig. 1 A), as measured by the MTT assay (ability of cells' mitochondria to reduce tetrazolium salts) or by counting the number of surviving cells (not shown). Pretreatment with the mild heat shock (preheating) reduced cell death after the second heat shock by more than 90% (Fig. 1 A). Cell death was preceded by an extensive cleavage of PARP (Fig. 1 B) and nuclear condensation (not shown), thus indicating that it was of an apoptotic, rather than of a necrotic, nature. Both the PARP cleavage (Fig. 1 B) and the nuclear condensation were strongly inhibited in the preheated cells. Preheating of cells also led to almost complete inhibition of activation of JNK in response to the second challenge with heat shock (Fig. 1 C). While JNK became activated 30 min following the heat shock and maintained its activity for 4 h, in preheated cells JNK activity was practically undetectable at any point during this time period (not shown). It is noteworthy that activation of another stress-activated kinase, p38, was also inhibited under these conditions by more than 70% (Fig. 1 D). This kinase was shown to participate in induction of IL-6, activation of phospholipase A2, regulation of phosphorylation of Hsp27, and other processes (26Beyaert R. Cuenda A. Berghe W.V. Plaisance S.

Biol. 1996; 6: 606-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Preheating of cells also strongly reduced activation of JNK and p38 kinases in response to another stress, a challenge with 9% ethanol (Fig. 1, C and D), and inhibited ethanol-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1, A andB). Since inactivation of JNK by overexpression of a dominant negative mutant of the upstream kinase was previously shown to protect cells against heat shock and some other stresses (9Verheij M. Bose R. Lin X.H. Yao B. Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Birrer M.J. Szabo E. Zon L.I. Kyriakis J.M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. Nature. 1996; 380: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1707) Google Scholar), we conclude that the protective action of the mild heat shock is associated with an suppression of the JNK activation. Thus, prevention of activation of JNK in preheated cells may be a significant factor in the phenomenon of acquired thermotolerance and tolerance to ethanol. These data complement the recent observation that JNK activation in response to mild heat shock is strongly reduced in a stable thermoresistant cell line (31Anderson R.L. Van K. Kraft P.E. Hahn G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3509-3516Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) that overproduced the whole set of heat shock proteins including Hsp72 (32Rosette C. Karin M. Science. 1996; 274: 1194-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). Since the protective effects of the mild heat shock may be associated not only with Hsp72 but also with some other heat-inducible polypeptides, we also studied the effects of stresses on a stably transfected PEER cell line that overexpresses Hsp72 under control of a tetracycline-regulated transactivator. We first reproduced the effects of mild heat shock on this cell line, i.e. demonstrated that preheating of the cells in the presence of tetracycline (without expression of Hsp72 from a plasmid) protects against heat shock and ethanol treatments and reduces activation of JNK and p38 (Fig. 1,C and D). To study the effect of Hsp72 produced from the plasmid under normal conditions, without mild heat shock (Fig.2 A), cells were incubated in the absence of tetracycline for 24 h, followed by selection of cells containing elevated levels of Hsp72 (see “Experimental Procedures”). In these cells the level of Hsp72 was about 3–4 times higher than that of PEER cells after the mild heat shock (not shown) and was similar to the level of Hsp72 in U937 cells following the mild heat shock. The selected cells with elevated levels of Hsp72 were challenged with a severe heat shock (60 min at 43 °C) or 9% ethanol. Activation of both JNK and p38 kinases was strongly inhibited in these cells compared with the cells with the normal level of Hsp72 grown in the presence of tetracycline (Fig. 2, B and C). A strong protection against apoptosis upon heat shock and ethanol treatments was also observed in the Hsp72 overproducing cells (Fig.2 D). These results support the hypothesis that Hsp72, when overproduced, inhibits activation of JNK and p38 kinases and thus suppresses cell suicide. It should be mentioned that, in the stably transfected cells that chronically overexpress Hsp72 (13Li G.C. Li L. Liu Y-K Mak J.Y. Chen L. Lee W.M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1681-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), we observed protection from apoptosis without inhibition of JNK activity. 2D. D. Mosser, submitted for publication., 3S. Rits, unpublished data. Therefore, it is possible that another mechanism of prevention of apoptosis that does not involve inhibition of JNK operates in cell lines that chronically overexpress Hsp72. On the other hand, the effect described here of the regulated acute overexpression of Hsp72 from the plasmid is identical to that of elevated levels of Hsp72 induced by the mild heat shock, indicating the physiological relevance of the observed phenomenon. It is noteworthy that the regulated overexpression of Hsp72 in the PEER cell line not only suppressed the responses to heat shock and ethanol but also strongly inhibited activation of both JNK (not shown) and p38 (Fig. 2 E) kinases caused by some other stresses, for example, osmotic shock, H2O2, and UV irradiation. Therefore, an elevated level of Hsp72 appears to interfere with transduction of signals from a variety of stressful conditions. Moreover, accumulation of Hsp72 strongly reduced activation of stress-induced kinases in response to TNF and IL-1, 4V. L. Gabai, manuscript in preparation. which is consistent with recent findings that the response of JNK (and potentially of p38 kinase) to UV and osmotic shock is mediated by the activation of TNF, IL-1, and epidermal growth factor receptors (33Mosser D.D. Duchaine J. Massie B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5427-5438Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Does a high level of Hsp72 directly affect activation of JNK and p38 kinases or does it through induction or repression of synthesis of some other proteins? To address this question, effects of addition of a purified recombinant Hsp72 on the activation of p38 kinase in cell lysate were studied. In a crude lysate p38 kinase becomes activated upon incubation at 20 °C for 15 min (Fig.3 A). Under exposure of the lysate to 43 °C, p38 kinase was activated even further (Fig. 3 B). No additional p38 activation was observed in the lysates subjected to UV irradiation (Fig. 3 B). Addition of purified Hsp72 (but not bovine serum albumin, not shown) repressed the activation by about 40–70% (Fig. 3 A). Importantly, the addition of a monoclonal anti-Hsp70 antibody (MA3-007, Affinity Bioreagents) raised against the conserved ATPase domain, which cross-reacts with all major species of Hsp70, had an effect opposite to that triggered by the addition of Hsp72. It led to a 1.5–3-fold stimulation of p38 kinase activity (Fig. 3 B). Addition of control monoclonal anti-β-galactosidase antibody did not cause activation of p38 (not shown). These data indicate that the level of Hsp70 in a cell may directly regulate stress-activated kinases. The observed variability in the extent of stimulation of p38 by MA3-007 antibody may be due to the presence of endogenous ADP. Indeed, addition of ADP strongly reduced the stimulatory effect of the anti-Hsp70 antibody (not shown). Experiments with activation of p38 kinase in a cell lysate by addition of anti-Hsp70 antibody suggested that depletion or just capturing of Hsp70 may result in activation of stress kinases in cells. Members of the Hsp70 family bind misfolded polypeptides and therefore could be captured upon a build-up of abnormal misfolded proteins in the cytosol. Therefore, to test whether accumulation of abnormal proteins cause activation of stress kinases, cells were incubated with amino acid analogs, which incorporate into newly synthesized polypeptides and prevent their proper folding. In fact, incubation of cells with the proline analog, l-azetidine carboxylate, as well as with the arginine analog, canavanine, stimulated both JNK and p38 kinases, and the overproduction of Hsp72 strongly reduced such activation (Fig.4, A and B). A similar stimulation of stress-activated kinases was observed upon incubation of the cells with puromycin, which causes an accumulation of truncated and therefore improperly folded N-terminal fragments of proteins (not shown). Therefore, build-up of abnormal proteins activates stress kinase, while Hsp72 and probably other members of Hsp70 family suppress such activation. These data suggest a mechanism of activation of stress kinases by heat shock and some other stressful conditions. Such stresses may cause protein damage and denaturation and may lead to a build-up of abnormal proteins. In turn these abnormal proteins deplete free Hsp70, which leads to activation of stress-activated kinases (Fig.5). The role of Hsp70 in the activation of stress kinases may be analogous to its role in activation of heat shock gene transcription (34Ananthan J Goldberg A.L. Voellmy R. Science. 1986; 232: 522-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar, 35Jaattela M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 4286-4294PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, we suggest that in unstressed cells Hsp70 associates with an upstream component of the kinase cascade and keeps it in an inactive form. Depletion of a free cellular Hsp70 by accumulated abnormal proteins after heat shock (21Georgopoulos C. Welch W.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 601-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar, 22Kampinga H.H. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 11-17PubMed Google Scholar) would cause dissociation of the bound Hsp70 from the upstream component of the kinase cascade, thus leading to activation of downstream kinases. Therefore, Hsp70 may function as a “stress sensor” that triggers not only transcription of the heat shock genes but also activation of stress kinases. The results described in this report may also explain why overproduction of Hsp72 prevents activation of the phospholipase A2 by TNF (36) and prevents induction of synthesis of IL-6 by IL-1 (15Simon M.M. Reikerstorter A. Schwarz A. Krone C. Luger T.A. Jaattela M. Schwarz T. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 926-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Indeed, Hsp72 may simply prevent activation by TNF or IL-1 of the p38 kinase, which was shown to activate the phospholipase A2 (27Waterman W.H. Molski T.F.P. Huang C.-K. Adams J.L. Sha'afi R.I. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and which is responsible for IL-6 induction (26Beyaert R. Cuenda A. Berghe W.V. Plaisance S. Lee J.C. Haegeman G. Cohen P. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1914-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). In summary, Hsp70 seems to play a very general role in signal transduction pathways, which lead to adaptation of cells and organisms to stressful conditions.

https://openalex.org/W2011885704,"Apolipoprotein (apo) E, a constituent of several lipoproteins, is a ligand for the low density lipoprotein receptor, and this interaction is important for maintaining cholesterol and triglyceride homeostasis. We have used a gene replacement strategy to generate mice that express the human apoE3 isoform in place of the mouse protein. The levels of apoE mRNA in various tissues are virtually the same in the human apoE3 homozygous (3/3) mice and their littermates having the wild type mouse allele (+/+). Total cholesterol and triglyceride levels in fasted plasma from the 3/3 mice were not different from those in the +/+ mice, when maintained on a normal (low fat) chow diet. We found, however, notable differences in the distribution of plasma lipoproteins and apolipoprotein E between the two groups: β-migrating lipoproteins and plasma apoB100 levels are decreased in the 3/3 mice, and the apoE distribution is shifted from high density lipoproteins to larger lipoprotein particles. In addition, the fractional catabolic rate of exogenously administered remnant particles without apoE was 6-fold slower in the 3/3 mice compared with the +/+ mice. When the 3/3 and +/+ animals were fed a high fat/high cholesterol diet, the 3/3 animals responded with a dramatic increase (5-fold) in total cholesterol compared with the +/+ mice (1.5-fold), and after 12 weeks on this same diet the 3/3 animals developed significantly (at least 13-fold) larger atherosclerotic plaques in the aortic sinus area than the +/+ animals. Thus the structural differences between human APOE3 and mouse ApoE proteins are sufficient to cause an increased susceptibility to dietary-induced hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis in the 3/3 mice."

We recently reported isolation of a ∼37-kDa protein in erythrocyte membrane that mediates Ca2+-dependent movement of PL between membrane leaflets, similar to that observed upon elevation of Ca2+ in the cytosol (Bassé, F., Stout, J. G., Sims, P. J., and Wiedmer, T. (1996) J. Biol. Chem.271, 17205–17210). Based on internal peptide sequence obtained from this protein, a 1,445-base pair cDNA was cloned from a K-562 cDNA library. The deduced “PL scramblase” protein is a proline-rich, type II plasma membrane protein with a single transmembrane segment near the C terminus. Antibody against the deduced C-terminal peptide was found to precipitate the ∼37-kDa red blood cell protein and absorb PL scramblase activity, confirming the identity of the cloned cDNA to erythrocyte PL scramblase. Ca2+-dependent PL scramblase activity was also demonstrated in recombinant protein expressed from plasmid containing the cDNA. Quantitative immunoblotting revealed an approximately 10-fold higher abundance of PL scramblase in platelet (∼104 molecules/cell) than in erythrocyte (∼103 molecules/cell), consistent with apparent increased PL scramblase activity of the platelet plasma membrane. PL scramblase mRNA was found in a variety of hematologic and nonhematologic cells and tissues, suggesting that this protein functions in all cells.

An increase in intracellular Ca2+ due to either cell activation, cell injury, or apoptosis causes a rapid bidirectional movement of the plasma membrane PL between leaflets, resulting in exposure of PS and phosphatidylethanolamine at the cell surface (1Schroit A.J.

This exposure of the plasma membrane aminophospholipids has been shown to promote assembly and activation of several key enzymes of the coagulation and complement systems, as well as to accelerate the clearance of injured or apoptotic cells by the reticuloendothelial system, suggesting that Ca2+-induced remodeling of plasma membrane PL is central to both vascular hemostatic and cellular clearance mechanisms (1Schroit A.J.

We recently reported isolation of a ∼37-kDa integral membrane protein from human erythrocytes that when reconstituted into liposomes mediated a Ca2+-dependent, bidirectional scrambling of PL between membrane leaflets mimicking the action of Ca2+at the endofacial surface of the erythrocyte membrane (10Bassé F.

Evidence for protein(s) in platelet that mediates a similar “PL scramblase” function when incorporated into liposomes has also been reported (12Comfurius P. Williamson P. Smeets E.F. Schlegel R.A. Bevers E.M. Zwaal R.F.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7631-7634Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Here we report the cDNA cloning and deduced structure of the PL scramblase from human erythrocyte and show evidence that this same protein is expressed in human platelet and various other cell lines and tissues where plasma membrane PL scramblase activity has been observed. Egg yolk PC, brain PS, and 1-oleoyl-2-[6(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino]caproyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (NBD-PC) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids. Expressed sequence tag (EST) clone with GenBank™ accession number gb AA143025 was obtained through American Type Culture Collection (ATCC 962235). All restriction enzymes and amylose resin were from New England BioLabs, Inc. KlenTaq polymerase was from CLONTECH Laboratories, wheat germ agglutinin Sepharose was from Sigma, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was from Eastman Kodak, factor Xa was from Hematologic Technologies, and Bio-Beads SM-2 were from Bio-Rad. N-Octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (OG) and Glu-Gly-Arg chloromethyl ketone were from Calbiochem. Sodium dithionite (Na2S2O4, Sigma) was freshly dissolved in 1 m Tris, pH 10, at a concentration of 1 m. PL scramblase was purified as described previously (10Bassé F. Stout J.G. Sims P.J. Wiedmer T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17205-17210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 11Stout J.G. Bassé F. Luhm R.A. Weiss H.J. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2232-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. The active fraction eluting from Mono S was concentrated and exchanged into 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.4, and absorbed against 5 ml of wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose to remove trace contaminating glycophorins. The breakthrough material was concentrated and exchanged into 20 mm Tris, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.4, and subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions in a 10% NuPAGE gel (Novex, San Diego, CA). The band at ∼37 kDa was visualized with 0.1% Brilliant Blue R-250 and excised for amino acid analysis and sequencing (University of Michigan Protein and Carbohydrate Structure Facility). 450 pmol of this protein was subjected to in situ cleavage with 10 mg/ml CNBr in 70% formic acid, the cleaved peptides were extracted into 60% acetonitrile, 10% trifluoroacetic acid, dried in a speed vacuum, and resolved by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto sequencing grade polyvinylidene difluoride. Peptides were observed by staining with Coomassie Blue, excised, and subjected to microsequencing using Edman chemistry on a model 494 Applied Biosystems sequencer run with standard cycles, yielding the sequence PAPQPPLNCPPGLEYLSQIDQILIHQQIELLE. This same sequence was partially confirmed in a second preparation of PL scramblase purified from erythrocyte ghosts and subjected to internal peptide sequencing as above. A BLAST homology search revealed 100% identity to the translation product of EST clone gb AA143025 with no significant sequence homology to any protein in available data bases. The 568-bp insert of EST clone gb AA143025 was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by Random Primed DNA Labeling Kit (Boehringer Mannheim) and used to screen a cDNA library derived from human erythroleukemic cell line K-562 in λgt11 (CLONTECH). Escherichia coli strain Y1090r was transformed by K-562 cDNA library (4.86 × 105 pfu) and poured on 27 agarose plates (15-cm diameter, 18,000 plaque-forming unit/plate). Plaques were lifted onto Hybond-N Nylon membranes (Amersham Corp.). After UV-cross-linking and prehybridization in a solution composed of 5 × Denhardt, 5 × SSC, 1% SDS, and 200 μg/ml herring sperm DNA for 3 h at 68 °C, the membranes were hybridized in the same solution containing 5 ng/ml 32P-labeled probe for 16 h at 68 °C. The membranes were washed once with 1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, then three times with 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 20 min at 65 °C, and exposed to x-ray film. Secondary plaque lifts and hybridization were carried out on 32 strongly positive plaques at a density of 50–100 plaques/plate. Single positive and well isolated plaques were picked and amplified. The length of cDNA insert was examined by PCR with λgt11 reverse and forward primers. Six clones with cDNA inserts of >1.4 kilobase pairs were selected for DNA sequencing. DNA was sequenced on an Applied Biosystems DNA Sequencer model 373 Stretch using PRISM Ready Reaction DyeDeoxy Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Perkin-Elmer) and combinations of vector and insert sequence primers. To express PL scramblase as a fusion protein with maltose binding protein (MBP), cDNA encoding PL scramblase was cloned into pMAL-C2 (New England BioLabs). PCR was performed on a full-length clone using the primers 5′-TCAGAATTCGGATCCATGGACAAACAAAACTCACAGATG-3′ with anEcoRI site before the ATG start codon and 5′-GCTTGCCTGCAGGTCGACCTACCACACTCCTGATTTTTGTTCC-3′ with aSalI site after the stop codon. KlenTaq polymerase (CLONTECH) was used to ensure high fidelity amplification. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI andSalI and isolated by electrophoresis on 1% low melting agarose gel and purification with Wizard kit (Promega). The amplified cDNA was cloned into pMAL-C2 vector digested with EcoRI and SalI, immediately 3′ of MBP. This construct was amplified in E. coli strain TB1, and the sequence of the cDNA insert of plasmids from single colonies was confirmed. 10 ml of E. coli TB1 transformed with scramblase cDNA-pMAL-C2 were used to inoculate 1 liter of rich LB containing 2 mg/ml glucose, 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and the bacteria were allowed to grow for about 4 h at 37 °C. When A 600reached ∼0.5, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.3 mm. After 2 h of incubation at 37 °C, the cells were centrifuged at 4000 ×g for 20 min. The cell pellet was suspended in 50 ml of 20 mm Tris, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (column buffer), and subjected to a freeze/thaw cycle. After sonication (3 × 30 s on ice) and centrifugation at 43,000 × g for 1 h, the supernatant was applied to 10 ml of amylose resin. The column was washed with 20 volumes of column buffer, and the scramblase-MBP fusion protein eluted with the same buffer containing 10 mm maltose. Digestion of MBP-PL scramblase protein with factor Xa was routinely performed at 1/100 (w/w) ratio of enzyme and monitored by SDS-PAGE. In addition to MBP, the product of this digest is the PL scramblase translation product containing the N-terminal extension Ile-Ser-Glu-Phe-Gly-Phe (codons −6 to −1). Reconstitution into proteoliposomes was performed essentially as described previously (10Bassé F. Stout J.G. Sims P.J. Wiedmer T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17205-17210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 11Stout J.G. Bassé F. Luhm R.A. Weiss H.J. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2232-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly, a mixture of PC and PS (9:1 molar ratio) was dried under a stream of nitrogen and resuspended in 100 mm Tris, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, pH 7.4 (Tris buffer). Protein samples to be reconstituted were added to the liposomes at a final lipid concentration of 4 mg/ml in the presence of 60 mm OG and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 200 volumes of Tris buffer containing 1 g/liter Bio-Beads SM-2. To liberate PL scramblase from MBP, the proteoliposomes were incubated for 3 h at room temperature in the presence of 1/40 (w/w) factor Xa. The digestion was terminated by the addition of 100 μm Glu-Gly-Arg chloromethyl ketone. Completeness of the digest was monitored by SDS-PAGE. Following dialysis, the proteoliposomes were labeled in the outer leaflet by the addition of 0.25 mol % fluorescent NBD-PC (in dimethyl sulfoxide; final solvent concentration, 0.25%). PL Scramblase activity was measured as described previously (10Bassé F. Stout J.G. Sims P.J. Wiedmer T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17205-17210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 11Stout J.G. Bassé F. Luhm R.A. Weiss H.J. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. J. Clin.

Routinely, proteoliposomes labeled with NBD-PC were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in Tris buffer in the presence or the absence of 2 mm CaCl2. Proteoliposomes were diluted 25-fold in Tris buffer containing 4 mm EGTA and transferred to a stirred fluorescence cuvette at 23 °C. Initial fluorescence was recorded (SLM Aminco 8000 spectrofluorimeter; excitation, 470 nm; emission, 532 nm), 20 mm dithionite was added, and the fluorescence was continuously monitored for a total of 120 s. The difference in nonquenchable fluorescence observed in the presence versusthe absence of CaCl2 was attributed to Ca2+-induced change in NBD-PC located in the outer leaflet (10Bassé F. Stout J.G.

Ionized [Ca2+] was calculated using FreeCal version 4.0 software (generously provided by Dr. Lawrence F. Brass, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA). The peptide CESTGSQEQKSGVW, corresponding to amino acids 306–318 of the predicted open reading frame of PL scramblase with an added N-terminal cysteine, was synthesized and conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Protein Core Facility, Blood Research Institute). Antiserum to this protein was raised in rabbit (Cocalico Biologicals, Inc.), and the IgG fraction was isolated on protein A-Sepharose-CL4B (Sigma). Peptide-specific antibody was isolated by affinity chromatography on UltraLink Iodoacetyl beads (Pierce) to which peptide CESTGSQEQKSGVW was conjugated. This affinity-purified antibody (anti-306–318) was used for immunoprecipitation and Western blotting of PL scramblase (see “Results and Discussion”). PL scramblase purified from human erythrocytes was 125I-labeled with Iodogen (Pierce), free iodide removed by gel filtration, and the protein was incubated (4 °C, overnight) with either anti-306–318,or an identical quantity of preimmune rabbit IgG (1 mg/ml in 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MOPS, 50 mm OG, pH 7.4) or no IgG as control. The IgG was precipitated with protein A-Sepharose and washed exhaustively, and protein bands were resolved by 8–25% SDS-PAGE (Phast System, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) under reducing conditions. Radioactive bands were visualized by autoradiography. To determine whether antibody to this peptide specifically removed the functional activity associated with the purified erythrocyte PL scramblase protein, the supernatant fractions remaining after immunoprecipitation were reconstituted in liposomes for activity measurements, performed as described above. For these experiments, unlabeled erythrocyte PL scramblase substituted for the125I-labeled protein. 2 × 108 washed platelets, 2 × 108 erythrocyte ghost membranes, 0.9 pmol of purified recombinant PL scramblase (obtained by factor Xa digest of the PL scramblase-MBP fusion protein), and 0.3 pmol of PL scramblase purified from human erythrocyte were each denatured by boiling in 40 μl of sample buffer containing 10% SDS, 4%β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm EDTA, and protein bands were resolved by SDS-PAGE. After transfer to nitrocellulose, the blocked membrane was incubated with 1 μg/ml of anti-306–318, and the blot was developed with horseradish preoxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) using Chemiluminescence Reagent (DuPont). Protein concentrations were estimated based upon optical density at 280 nm, using extinction coefficients (m−1 cm−1) of 39,000 (PL scramblase), 64,500 (MBP), and 105,000 (PL scramblase-MBP fusion). PL scramblase contained in human platelet and erythrocyte membranes was estimated by quantitative immunoblotting of the detergent extracts, with reference to known quantities of purified MBP-PL scramblase fusion protein. Human multiple tissue Northern blot and human cancer cell line multiple tissue Northern blot membranes were obtained from CLONTECH. The blots were prehybridized with ExpressHyb (CLONTECH) at 68 °C for 30 min and hybridized with ExpressHyb containing 5 ng/ml32P-labeled PL scramblase cDNA probe at 68 °C for 1 h, then washed, and exposed to x-ray film. After development, the blots were stripped and hybridized with 32P-labeled β-actin cDNA probe using identical conditions. PL scramblase was purified from human erythrocyte membranes and cleaved with cyanogen bromide, and Edman degradation was performed on a 12-kDa peptide fragment to obtain 32 residues of peptide sequence (Fig. 1,underlined sequence). This peptide sequence, plus the anticipated methionine residue N-terminal to the predicted site of cyanogen bromide cleavage, was identified in the translation product of a 568-bp EST clone deposited in GenBank by the I.M.A.G.E. Consortium (clone identification number 505141). No other significant matches to this sequence were identified in any protein data base. The EST clone was used to screen a human K-562 leukemic cell cDNA library. Of 32 positive clones identified by plaque hybridization, six clones were sequenced yielding 1445 bp of cDNA (Fig. 1). The open reading frame encodes a protein without a signal sequence that contains 318 residues with a calculated mass of 35.1 kDa, a theoretical pI of 4.8, and a single predicted transmembrane helix near the C terminus (residues Ala291–Gly309), in good agreement with the physical properties observed for the ∼37-kDa protein band we tentatively identified as PL scramblase in human erythrocyte membrane (10Bassé F. Stout J.G. Sims P.J. Wiedmer T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17205-17210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Whereas the deduced protein sequence is notable for its high proline (12%) content, homology searching failed to reveal significant concensus to identifiable protein family or domain structures, with the exception of a single potential protein kinase C phosphorylation site (Thr161). The possibility that PL scramblase function is mediated by a phosphoprotein has previously been suggested based on an observed decrease in PL scrambling activity in erythrocytes depleted of ATP (14Martin D.W. Jesty J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10468-10474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Analysis of the cDNA-derived protein sequence (Tmpred program, ISREC server, University of Lausanne, Epalinges, Switzerland) revealed a strongly preferred (p < 0.01) inside-to-outside orientation of the predicted 19-residue transmembrane helix, consistent with a type II plasma membrane protein. Most of the polypeptide (residues 1–290) thereby extends from the cytoplasmic membrane leaflet, leaving a short exoplasmic tail (residues 310–318). The predicted orientation of this protein is consistent with the anticipated topology of PL scramblase in the erythrocyte membrane, where lipid-mobilizing function is responsive to [Ca2+] only at the endofacial surface of the membrane (3Williamson P. Kulick A. Zachowski A. Schlegel R.A. Devaux P.F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6355-6360Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar,5Smeets E.F. Comfurius P. Bevers E.M. Zwaal R.F.A. Biochim. Biophys.

To confirm that the cDNA we cloned from the K-562 cDNA library actually encodes the same protein purified as PL scramblase from human erythrocyte membrane, we raised a rabbit antibody against the deduced C terminus predicted from the open reading frame of the cloned cDNA (codons 306–318). As shown in Fig. 2, this antibody precipitated the ∼37-kDa red cell protein we tentatively identified as PL scramblase and also absorbed the functional activity detected in this isolated erythrocyte membrane protein fraction. As also evident from Fig. 2 (inset), we often observed the partial proteolysis of 37-kDa PL scramblase to a polypeptide of ∼30 kDa. The apparent susceptibility of this protein to proteolytic degradation may account for the reported rapid loss of activity observed in earlier attempts to purify PL scramblase from platelet (12Comfurius P. Williamson P. Smeets E.F. Schlegel R.A. Bevers E.M. Zwaal R.F.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7631-7634Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Recombinant PL scramblase was expressed in E. coli as fusion protein with MBP, purified by amylose affinity chromatography, and incorporated into PC/PS liposomes for assay of PL scramblase activity. When incorporated into liposomes, the recombinant protein mediated a Ca2+-dependent transbilayer movement of NBD-PC mimicking the activity of PL scramblase isolated from erythrocyte. PL scramblase activity was observed both for the chimeric MBP-PL scramblase fusion protein (not shown) and for recombinant PL scramblase liberated from MBP through proteolytic digestion with factor Xa (Fig. 3). By contrast, no such activity was observed for control protein consisting of the pMAL-C2 translation product MBP lacking the PL scramblase cDNA insert. The specific PL mobilizing activity of recombinant PL scramblase expressed and purified from E. coli was approximately 50% of that observed for the endogenous protein purified from the erythrocyte membrane, which is likely due to incomplete folding of the recombinant protein. Half-maximal [Ca2+] required for activation was approximately 100–200 μm for recombinant protein purified from E. coli versus ∼40 μm for the erythrocyte-derived protein, raising the possibility that altered folding or an unknown post-translational modification in mammalian cells affects the putative Ca2+ binding site (10Bassé F. Stout J.G. Sims P.J. Wiedmer T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17205-17210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 11Stout J.G. Bassé F. Luhm R.A. Weiss H.J. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2232-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In addition to activation by Ca2+, the transbilayer migration of PL in erythrocytes is accelerated upon acidification of the inside leaflet to pH < 6.0 (in absence of Ca2+), a response that is also observed in proteoliposomes containing PL scramblase purified from erythrocyte membranes (11Stout J.G. Bassé F. Luhm R.A. Weiss H.J. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2232-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A similar acid-dependent activation of PL mobilizing function was also exhibited by proteoliposomes incorporating recombinant PL scramblase purified from E. coli (not shown). In addition to the presumed role of PL scramblase in PS exposure following cell injury and upon repeated sickling of SS hemoglobin red cells, the capacity of activated platelets to rapidly mobilize aminophospholipids across the plasma membrane is thought to play a central role in the initiation of thrombin generation required for plasma clotting (17Zwaal R.F.A.

Whereas incubation with Ca2+ ionophore causes a marked acceleration in transbilayer movement of plasma membrane PL in both platelets and erythrocytes, the apparent rate of transbilayer PL migration in platelet exceeds that in erythrocyte by approximately 10-fold, implying either a higher abundance of PL scramblase or the action of another component in platelet with enhanced PL scrambling function (18Sulpice J.C. Zachowski A. Devaux P.F. Giraud F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6347-6354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Sulpice J.C. Moreau C. Devaux P.F. Zachowski A. Giraud F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13345-13352Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Zwaal and associates recently reported evidence for the existence of protein(s) in platelet with functional properties similar to that of PL scramblase we isolated from erythrocyte (10Bassé F. Stout J.G. Sims P.J. Wiedmer T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17205-17210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 11Stout J.G. Bassé F. Luhm R.A. Weiss H.J. Wiedmer T.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7631-7634Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To determine whether the protein we now identify in the erythrocyte membrane is also found in platelets, we probed platelets with antibody against PL scramblase residues 306–318. As shown in Fig. 4, this antibody blotted a single protein in platelet with similar mobility to the ∼37-kDa PL scramblase in erythrocyte. Based on quantitative immunoblotting with anti-306–318, we estimate approximately 104 molecules/cell in platelet versus103 molecules/cell in erythrocyte, consistent with the increased PL scramblase activity and procoagulant function observed for human platelets versus erythrocytes. In addition to platelet and red blood cell, PL scramblase activity has been observed in many other cells, and this Ca2+-induced response is thought to be central to the rapid movement of PS and phosphatidylethanolamine from inner plasma membrane leaflet to the surface of perturbed endothelium and a variety of injured and apoptotic cells (17Zwaal R.F.A. Schroit A.J. Blood. 1997; 89: 1121-1132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting exposure of PS at the cell surface is thought to play a key role in removal of such cells by the reticuloendothelial system, in addition to activation of both the plasma complement and coagulation systems (8Wang R.H. Phillips Jr., G. Medof M.E. Mold C. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1326-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 9Fadok V.A. Voelker D.R. Campbell P.A. Cohen J.J. Bratton D.L. Henson P.M. J.

Whereas the molecular mechanism(s) in each circumstance remains unresolved, evidence for a specific platelet membrane protein functioning to accelerate migration of PL between membrane leaflets at increased cytosolic [Ca2+] has been reported (12Comfurius P. Williamson P. Smeets E.F. Schlegel R.A. Bevers E.M. Zwaal R.F.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7631-7634Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), similar to the proposed role of PL scramblase in red blood cells (10Bassé F. Stout J.G. Sims P.J. Wiedmer T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17205-17210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar,11Stout J.G. Bassé F. Luhm R.A. Weiss H.J. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2232-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). It was thus of interest to determine whether mRNA for this protein is expressed in nucleated cells where PL scramblase-like activity has been observed. As shown by Fig. 5, Northern blotting with PL scramblase cDNA revealed transcripts of ∼1.6 and ∼2.6 kilobases in all tissues and cell lines tested. Some tissue-to-tissue and cell line variability in the relative abundance of these two transcripts is apparent, the significance of which remains to be determined. Also notable was markedly reduced expression in HL-60 and the lymphoma lines Raji and MOLT-4, whereas abundant message was detected in spleen, thymus, and peripheral leukocytes. In addition to the transformed cell lines shown, mRNA for PL scramblase was also confirmed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (not shown). Whereas these data imply that the same protein identified as mediating accelerated transbilayer flip-flop of the erythrocyte membrane PL also plays a similar role in the plasma membrane of platelets, leukocytes, and other cells, actual confirmation for this role of PL scramblase awaits analysis of a cell line that is selectively deficient in this protein. In Scott syndrome, a bleeding disorder related to an inherited deficiency of plasma membrane PL scramblase function, erythrocytes and other cells deficient in PL scramblase activity were found to contain normal amounts of the PL scramblase protein (11Stout J.G. Bassé F. Luhm R.A. Weiss H.J. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2232-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). 2Q. Zhou, J. Zhao, J. G. Stout, P. J. Sims, and T. Wiedmer, unpublished data. Furthermore, despite the apparent deficiency in Scott syndrome cells of endogenous PL scramblase function, when PL scramblase protein from these cells was purified and reconstituted in proteoliposomes containing exogenous PL, it exhibited normal Ca2+-dependent PL mobilizing activity (11Stout J.G. Bassé F. Luhm R.A. Weiss H.J. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2232-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This suggests that in addition to the known regulation by intracellular [Ca2+], the activity of PL scramblase in the plasma membrane is regulated by other as yet unidentified membrane or cytoplasmic component(s).

Recently, a different and new physiological role has been defined for these compounds because of their involvement in nitric oxide (NO) binding and transport in biological systems. In view of these characteristics, we examined the effect of thiols and NO on the expression of the inducible form of heme oxygenase (HO-1), a stress protein that degrades heme to carbon monoxide and biliverdin. Cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells exposed to the NO donors sodium nitroprusside (SNP) andS-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) resulted in increased heme oxygenase activity and HO-1 expression. Co-incubation with N-acetylcysteine, a precursor of glutathione synthesis, significantly attenuated heme oxygenase induction by SNP and SNAP, and a reduction in heme oxygenase activity was also observed when cells were preincubated with N-acetylcysteine for 16 h prior to exposure to NO donors. This effect appears to be associated with NO stabilization by thiols through the formation ofS-nitrosothiols. Hydroxocobalamin, a specific NO scavenger, significantly decreased endothelial heme oxygenase activity, indicating a direct involvement of NO released by NO donors to regulate the expression of this stress protein. Moreover, superoxide anion (O·̄2) and its reaction product with NO, peroxynitrite (ONOO−), were found to partially contribute to the observed NO-mediated activation of endothelial heme oxygenase. Thus, we suggest the existence of a dynamic equilibrium among free NO, O·̄2, and endogenous glutathione, which might constitute an interactive signaling mechanism modulating stress and adaptive responses in tissues.

Heme oxygenase is a widely distributed enzyme in mammalian tissues, and its main function is associated with the degradation of heme to biliverdin, iron, and carbon monoxide (CO). 1The abbreviations used are: CO, carbon monoxide; HO-2, constitutive heme oxygenase; HO-1, inducible heme oxygenase; NO, nitric oxide; SNP, sodium nitroprusside; SNAP,S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine; GSNO,S-nitrosoglutathione; BSO,dl-buthionine-[S,R]-sulfoximine; ONOO−, peroxynitrite; O·̄2, superoxide anion; SOD, superoxide dismutase; SIN-1, 3-morpholinosydnonimine; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 1The abbreviations used are: CO, carbon monoxide; HO-2, constitutive heme oxygenase; HO-1, inducible heme oxygenase; NO, nitric oxide; SNP, sodium nitroprusside; SNAP,S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine; GSNO,S-nitrosoglutathione; BSO,dl-buthionine-[S,R]-sulfoximine; ONOO−, peroxynitrite; O·̄2, superoxide anion; SOD, superoxide dismutase; SIN-1, 3-morpholinosydnonimine; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. Two distinct isoforms of the protein have been characterized revealing that one of the isozymes is constitutive (HO-2), whereas the other is inducible (HO-1) (1Maines M.D. Trakshel G.M. Kutty R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 411-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, if the first enzyme is constitutively expressed and is part of the normal cellular metabolism, the second is regarded as a heat shock protein, and its expression is elicited by many conditions and factors that produce an imbalance in the cellular functions. Various agents, including heavy metal ions (2Maines M.D. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2557-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar), oxidative stress (3Applegate L.A. Luscher P. Tyrrell R.M. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 974-978PubMed Google Scholar), endotoxins (4Rizzardini M. Carelli M. Cabello Porras M.R. Cantoni L. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and hemoglobin (5Balla J. Jacob H.S. Balla G. Nath K. Eaton J.W. Vercellotti G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9285-9289Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar) are capable of inducing HO-1 in different tissues, and recent findings showed that nitric oxide (NO) donors increase HO-1 mRNA in the brain (6Hara E. Takahashi K. Tominaga T. Kumabe T. Kayama T. Suzuki H. Fujita H. Yoshimoto T. Shirato K. Shibahara S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and in cultured hepatocytes (7Kim Y.-M. Bergonia H.A. Muller C. Pitt B.R. Watkins W.D. Lancaster Jr., J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5710-5713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we have reported the ability of diverse NO releasing agents to modulate heme oxygenase activity in aortic endothelial cells (8Motterlini R. Foresti R. Intaglietta M. Winslow R.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: H107-H114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological importance of HO-1 induction following stress situations is not fully understood, although it has been hypothesized that the expression of this gene is part of the defensive mechanism that cells and tissues are capable of mounting against different stress stimuli. To sustain this idea are the findings that biliverdin and bilirubin, end products of heme catabolism, possess antioxidant properties (9Stocker R. Yamamoto Y. McDonagh A.F. Glazer A.N. Ames B.N. Science. 1987; 235: 1043-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (2912) Google Scholar) and that CO seems to mimic many NO functions. Like NO, CO activates soluble guanylate cyclase and inhibits platelet aggregation (10Utz J. Ullrich V. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 41: 1195-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 11Brune B. Ullrich V. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 32: 497-504Google Scholar), and its possible role as a neurotransmitter has been postulated (12Verma A. Hirsch D.J. Glatt C.E. Ronnett G.V. Snyder S.H. Science. 1993; 259: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar, 13Maines M.D. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1993; 4: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Recent findings also show the participation of CO in the regulation of vascular tone in hepatic sinusoidal cells, suggesting that NO and CO could share the control of relaxation processes (14Suematsu M. Goda N. Sano T. Kashiwagi S. Egawa T. Shinoda Y. Ishimura Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2431-2437Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). NO is a free radical species with multiple biological functions and has been identified as endothelium-derived relaxing factor (15Palmer R.M.J. Ferrige A.G. Moncada S. Nature. 1987; 327: 524-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (9310) Google Scholar, 16Ignarro L.J. Buga G.M. Wood K.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 9265-9269Crossref PubMed Scopus (4329) Google Scholar, 17Khan M.T. Furchgott R.F. Fed. Proc. 1987; 46: 385Google Scholar). It reacts rapidly with superoxide anion (O·̄2) to form the stable peroxynitrite anion (ONOO−), which decomposes once protonated to yield a strong oxidant with reactivity similar to hydroxyl radical (OH⋅) (18Beckman J.S. Beckman T.W. Chen J. Marshall P.A. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1620-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (6698) Google Scholar). In addition, NO has a high affinity for heme-iron molecules and interacts readily with thiol groups of proteins and glutathione producing S-nitrosoproteins andS-nitrosothiols, respectively (19Ignarro L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1990; 30: 535-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar, 20Stamler J.S. Simon D.I. Osborne J.A. Mullins M.E. Jaraki O. Michel T. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 444-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that S-nitrosylation of proteins could mediate signaling functions similar to those of protein phosphorylation (21Stamler J.S. Cell. 1994; 78: 931-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1633) Google Scholar) and that thiols may be involved in NO stabilization and metabolism (22Stamler J.S. Jaraki O. Osborne J. Simon D.I. Keaney J. Vita J. Singel D. Valeri C.R. Loscalzo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7674-7677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar). S-Nitrosothiols indeed possess endothelium-derived relaxing factor-like characteristics and, in virtue of their NO releasing capacities, may invoke many and possibly all NO actions (23Feelisch M. Stamler J.S. Feelisch M. Stamler J.S. Methods in Nitric Oxide Research. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1996: 521-539Google Scholar). There is at present a commonly accepted concept that NO diffuses freely in tissues where it exerts its biological activities. A recent report, however, considers the perspective that NO, to reach its pharmacological targets, has to diffuse through the intracellular environment where glutathione levels are in the range of 5–10 mm (24Hogg N. Singh R.J. Kalyanaraman B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Several important roles distinguish glutathione as the most important cellular nonprotein thiol. It is a cofactor for many glycolytic enzymes, participates in the transport of amino acids, and constitutes the major cellular antioxidant, being present at high concentrations in most animal cells (25Deneke S.M. Fanburg B.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: L163-L173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It plays a key function in reacting with harmful free radicals produced during the metabolism contributing to cellular detoxification. However, depletion of intracellular levels of glutathione may occur in conditions of severe and intense oxidant stress leading to increased susceptibility to cytotoxicity. A correlation between heme oxygenase and glutathione has been documented (4Rizzardini M. Carelli M. Cabello Porras M.R. Cantoni L. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 26Lautier D. Luscher P. Tyrrell R.M. Carcinogenesis. 1992; 13: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) where HO-1 levels are augmented in conditions of decreased intracellular glutathione. Whether decreased glutathione levels affect heme oxygenase via accumulation of reactive oxygen species or by modulating a signaling mechanism is unknown. The purpose of the present study was to examine the role of exogenous and endogenous thiol-containing compounds in the regulation of heme oxygenase induction by NO and other radical species in bovine aortic endothelial cells. We report that increased thiol levels reduce heme oxygenase expression and activity mediated by NO donors and that both O·̄2 and ONOO− appear to partially contribute to the stimulation of this stress response; the physiological relevance of these findings will be discussed. Bovine aortic endothelial cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells were purchased from the European Collection of Animal Cell Culture (Salisbury, UK). Hemin was obtained from Porphyrin Products Inc. (Logan, UT). Sodium nitroprusside (SNP),S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP),N-acetylcysteine,dl-buthionine-[S,R]-sulfoximine (BSO), S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), hydroxocobalamin, and superoxide dismutase (SOD, bovine liver) were all purchased from Sigma. 3-Morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1) and sodium peroxynitrite were obtained from Alexis Corp. (Bingham, Nottingham, UK). Peroxynitrite was prepared fresh in sodium hydroxide (0.3 mm), shipped via courier on dry ice and immediately stored at −80 °C. The concentration of peroxynitrite was monitored each day before use by measuring the absorbance at 302 nm (extinction coefficient = 1670m−1 cm−1) after addition of 25 (stock solution) to 975 μl of ice-cold 0.3 m sodium hydroxide. All the experiments with peroxynitrite were carried out within 10 days after receiving the drug, and the concentration was verified to be >95% of the stipulated one. Only small volumes of peroxynitrite were added to the culture media, and no significant changes in pH were observed. Bovine aortic endothelial cells were cultured in 75-cm2 flasks and grown in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 8% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml). Cells used for the heme oxygenase assay were cultured to reach confluency in 75-cm2 flasks; the glutathione determination method was performed in confluent cells grown in 6-well plates, and for the nitrite and S-nitrosothiols measurements cells were subcultured in 24-well tissue culture plates. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were cultured in 75-cm2 flasks in Medium 199 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and antibiotics. To investigate the effect of NO and the role of NO-derived intermediate(s) on endothelial heme oxygenase activation, several common NO donors were examined either alone or in the presence of various scavengers and agents. In the first group of experiments, cells were incubated for 6 h in complete medium (control) or in medium supplemented with SNP (0.5 and 1 mm), SNAP (0.5 mm), or GSNO (0.5 mm). In a different set of experiments cells were exposed to SNP or SNAP in the presence of the glutathione precursorN-acetylcysteine (0.25, 1, 2.5, and 5 mm). Hydroxocobalamin (vitamin B12), known as a NO scavenger (27Rajanayagam M.A.S. Li C.G. Rand M.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 108: 3-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), was also used at a final concentration of 0.5 mm in the presence of SNP or SNAP. A third group of experiments consisted of pre-exposure of cells for 16 h to 2.5 mm N-acetylcysteine, subsequently followed by 6 h incubation with 1 mm SNP or 0.5 mm SNAP. To study the possible interaction between superoxide anion (O·̄2) and NO in the modulation of heme oxygenase activity, endothelial cells were exposed for 6 h to the NO releasing agent SIN-1, which is known to generate stoichiometric amounts of NO and O·̄2 leading to the formation of the potent oxidant peroxynitrite (ONOO−) (28Hogg N. Darley-Usmar V.M. Wilson M.T. Moncada S. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). The direct involvement of ONOO− (150 and 300 μm) was also investigated, and the contribution of O·̄2 in the induction of heme oxygenase was examined in cell cultures to which the various NO donors (SNP, SNAP, or SIN-1) were added in the presence of SOD (50 units/ml). Heme oxygenase activity assay was performed as described previously by Motterlini et al. (29Motterlini R. Foresti R. Intaglietta M. Vandegriff K. Winslow R.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: H648-H655PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, microsomes from harvested cells were added to a reaction mixture containing NADPH (0.8 mm), glucose 6-phosphate (2 mm), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (0.2 units), 3 mg of rat liver cytosol prepared from a 105,000 × g supernatant fraction as a source of biliverdin reductase, potassium phosphate buffer (PBS, 100 mm, pH 7.4), MgCl2 (0.2 mm), and hemin (20 μm). The reaction was conducted at 37 °C in the dark for 1 h and terminated by the addition of 1 ml of chloroform, and the extracted bilirubin was calculated by the difference in absorbance between 464 and 530 nm (ε = 40 mm−1 cm−1). Heme oxygenase activity was expressed as picomoles of bilirubin/mg of cell protein/h. The total protein content of confluent cells was determined using a Bio-Rad DC protein assay (Bio-Rad, Herts, UK) by comparison with a standard curve obtained with bovine serum albumin. Samples of endothelial cells treated for the heme oxygenase activity assay were also analyzed by Western immunoblot technique. Cells were lysed in cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100. Total protein content was determined as reported above, and an equal protein concentration (30 μg/well) from each sample was then boiled for 5 min in Laemmli buffer (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar). Protein separation was carried out by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a 12% acrylamide resolving gel (Mini Protean II System, Bio-Rad, Herts, UK). Separated proteins were then transferred overnight to nitrocellulose membranes, and the nonspecific binding of antibodies was blocked with 3% non-fat dried milk in PBS, pH 7.4, for 2 h at room temperature. Membranes were then probed with a polyclonal rabbit anti-HO-1 antibody (Stressgen, Victoria, Canada) (1:1000 dilution in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4) for 2 h at room temperature. After three washes with PBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, blots were visualized using an amplified alkaline phosphatase kit from Sigma (Extra-3A) and the relative density of bands analyzed by an imaging densitometer (model GS-700, Bio-Rad, Herts, UK). The 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) colorimetric assay was used for the measurement of glutathione, the only detectable thiol in endothelial cells. To assess the sensitivity of the method in our experimental conditions, cells were incubated for 6 h with BSO (0.5 and 1 mm), a selective inhibitor of glutathione biosynthesis, or with increasing concentrations ofN-acetylcysteine (0.25, 1, and 2.5 mm). In another set of experiments, cells were incubated for 6 h in the presence of different NO donors with or withoutN-acetylcysteine. Glutathione levels were also measured after 16 h exposure of cells to 2.5 mm N-acetylcysteine. At the end of the incubation period, cells were washed with PBS, and 600 μl of a 2% (w/v) solution of 5-sulfosalicylic acid was added for cell lysis and deproteinization. The samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 × g, and 500-μl aliquots were reacted with 500 μl of 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) solution (0.3 m sodium phosphate buffer, 10 mm EDTA, and 0.2 mm5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid), freshly prepared), and after 5 min the absorbance was read at 412 nm (extinction coefficient was 14.3 mm−1 cm−1) (31Mayer B. Schrammel A. Klatt P. Koesling D. Schmidt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17355-17360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Nitrite levels were measured in the culture medium after 2, 4, and 6 h incubation of confluent endothelial cells with various concentrations of NO donors in the presence or absence of N-acetylcysteine. Where indicated, 100 μl of the culture medium were reacted with an equal volume of Griess reagent (0.5% sulfanilamide, 0.05%N-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine dihydrochloride in 2.5% H3PO4) in 96-well plates at room temperature for 10 min with shaking. The resulting azodye product was spectrophotometrically quantitated at 550 nm using a Dynatech MR 700 microplate reader, and nitrite levels were determined as described previously by comparison with standard curves made from a solution of sodium nitrite (32Motterlini R. Hidalgo A. Sammut A. Shah K.A. Mohammed S. Srai K. Green C.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The Saville method was used for the measurement of S-nitrosothiols (33Saville B. Analyst. 1958; 83: 670-672Crossref Google Scholar). Confluent cells were incubated for 0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 h with SNP (1 mm) plus N-acetylcysteine (1 mm) or SNAP (0.5 mm) plus N-acetylcysteine (2.5 mm). After incubation, 50 μl of the culture supernatant was reacted for 5 min with an equivalent volume of solution A (sulfanilamide 1% dissolved in 0.5 m HCl) or solution B (solution A plus 0.2% HgCl2), allowing the development of the diazonium salt. The formation of the azo dye product was obtained reacting the two samples for an additional 5 min with an equal volume of solution C (0.02% of N-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine dihydrochloride dissolved in 0.5 m HCl), and the absorbance was subsequently read at 550 nm with a Dynatech MR 700 microplate reader. To counteract the high nitrite concentration in the background, an equal volume of 0.5% ammonium sulfamate in water was added to the samples 5 min before the addition of sulfanilamide.S-Nitrosothiols were quantified as the difference of absorbance between solution B and A (B-A) comparing the values with a standard curve made from a solution of S-nitrosoglutathione. Differences in the data among the groups were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance combined with the Bonferroni's test, and all values were expressed as mean ± S.E. The differences between groups were considered to be significant atp < 0.05. N-Acetylcysteine, a well-known glutathione precursor with antioxidant properties, significantly reduced the activation of heme oxygenase by SNP in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1 A). These results paralleled those obtained with Western blot analysis, showing that the inducible heme oxygenase (HO-1) is the enzymatic form affected by the presence of SNP (Fig. 1 B). Similar effects were observed with another NO donor, SNAP. Although higher concentrations of N-acetylcysteine (2.5 and 5 mm) were needed to significantly attenuate HO-1 induction by SNAP, the effect was still dose-dependent (Fig.2). To examine whether an elevated intracellular glutathione concentration could also influence HO-1 induction caused by SNP and SNAP, endothelial cells were pretreated with 2.5 mm N-acetylcysteine for 16 h prior incubation with NO donors. Treatment with N-acetylcysteine produced an increase in intracellular glutathione levels of approximately 100% above the control values, and under this condition, we observed a marked attenuation in heme oxygenase activity mediated by SNP and SNAP (Fig.3). These findings indicate a possible role of thiol-containing compounds in the modulation of HO-1 induction by NO donors. The interaction between NO released by SNP or SNAP and O·̄2 produced intracellularly was also considered as a possible mechanism for the increased heme oxygenase activity. As shown in Fig.3, incubation of cells in the presence of SOD for 6 h resulted in a partial reduction in heme oxygenase activation by SNP (38%) and SNAP (56%), respectively.Figure 2Effect of N-acetylcysteine on endothelial heme oxygenase activation byS-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP).Heme oxygenase activity was measured after 6-h incubations of cells with 0.5 mm SNAP, 0.5 mm SNAP + 1 mm N-acetylcysteine, 0.5 mm SNAP + 2.5 mm N-acetylcysteine, 0.5 mm SNAP + 5 mm N-acetylcysteine.

Morana S.J. Kruszyna H. Russell M.A. Wilcox D.E. Smith R.P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 275: 48-52PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the use of hydroxocobalamin has been an important tool in our experiments to determine the direct involvement of NO in mediating HO-1 induction. As shown in Fig. 3, hydroxocobalamin (0.5 mm) produced a significant decrease in heme oxygenase activation by NO donors (p < 0.05). Although these data do not allow us to distinguish if NO per se or an intermediary molecule(s) is the signal for heme oxygenase induction, they do, however, indicate that NO is the initial element in the cascade of events that leads to up-regulation of the enzyme. Because of its potential ability to generate ONOO− via simultaneous release of NO and O·̄2, the NO releasing agent SIN-1 was considered separately from SNP and SNAP. As shown in Fig. 4, heme oxygenase activity significantly increased after 6 h exposure to SIN-1 (750 μm) from 214 ± 11 to 2306 ± 104 pmol of bilirubin/mg protein/h (p < 0.05). This effect was almost completely abolished by the presence of SOD in the culture medium (487 ± 18 pmol of bilirubin/mg protein/h). When ONOO− was added directly to the culture medium, a dose-dependent increase in heme oxygenase activity was also observed. The activity increased from 214 ± 11 to 641 ± 17 and 1019 ± 48 pmol of bilirubin/mg protein/h in the presence of 150 and 300 μm ONOO−, respectively. Because N-acetylcysteine contains sulfhydryl groups that can react with NO, its effect on nitrite production by NO donors was examined. If N-acetylcysteine stabilizes NO released by NO donors, then a lower nitrite production would be expected in the culture medium supplemented with the sulfhydryl agent. In contrast, in the present study a substantial enhancement in nitrite production was observed when N-acetylcysteine was added to the culture medium containing SNP or SNAP (Fig. 5,A and B). This enhancement was dose-dependent with SNP and increasing concentrations ofN-acetylcysteine (0.25 and 1 mm); however, in the case of SNAP the significant (p < 0.05) increase in nitrite levels was the same with all the concentrations ofN-acetylcysteine used (0.25, 1, and 2.5 mm). Furthermore, at the same concentration of N-acetylcysteine, nitrite accumulation by NO donors remained unchanged at the time points considered in our experimental protocol. These results suggest that the apparent reaction between NO donors and N-acetylcysteine occurs in the early period of co-incubation. S-Nitrosothiols (or thionitrites) are one of the products of the reaction between NO and thiol groups. It was therefore deemed necessary to establish whether the conditions of our experiments were favorable for the formation ofS-nitrosothiols. The supernatant of cells incubated with SNP (1 mm) plus N-acetylcysteine (1 mm) showed S-nitrosothiol formation only at time 0; at all following time points there was no detection ofS-nitrosothiols according to the Saville method (see TableI). These results suggest that SNP andN-acetylcysteine can react to produce thionitrites; however, the presence of metal traces in the culture medium, the aerobic experimental conditions, and the high concentration of thiols used during the incubation can account for the inability to detectS-nitrosothiols after time 0, since the above factors all strongly accelerate thionitrite decomposition. The supernatant of cells incubated with SNAP (0.5 mm) plusN-acetylcysteine (2.5 mm) showed very high amounts of S-nitrosothiols at time 0 and little at the following time points considered. These data required a different interpretation since SNAP is an S-nitrosothiol. At time 0 we likely measured SNAP and the thionitrite produced by the reaction between the NO donor and N-acetylcysteine. The pronounced decay observed at subsequent times indicated that the half-life of both SNAP and the thionitrite is very short, possibly because of the same factors influencing S-nitrosothiol decomposition when SNP and N-acetylcysteine were used. Moreover, a transnitrosation reaction occurring between SNAP and N-acetylcysteine could also explain the low amount of thionitrites observed after time 0. In these groups of experiments the concentrations chosen forN-acetylcysteine were the ones that exhibited a marked reduction in heme oxygenase activity.Table IFormation of S-nitrosothiols in the presence of SNP or SNAP and N-acetylcysteineS-Nitrosothiols1-aS-Nitrosothiol determination was carried out in the culture medium of treated cells at the times indicated.

New amino termini detected by protein sequence analysis in insoluble elastin following proteolytic digestion reveal the P′1 residues in the carboxyl-terminal direction from the scissile bond. The relative proportion of each amino acid in this position reflects the proteolytic preference of the elastolytic enzyme. The predominant amino acids detected by protein sequence analysis following cleavage of insoluble elastin with HME, MME, and 92-kDa gelatinase were Leu, Ile, Ala, Gly, and Val. HME and MME were similar in their substrate specificity and showed a stronger preference for Leu/Ile than did the 92-kDa enzyme. Fibroblast collagenase showed no activity toward elastin. The amino acid residues detected in insoluble elastin following hydrolysis with porcine pancreatic elastase and human neutrophil elastase were predominantly Gly and Ala, with lesser amounts of Val, Phe, Ile, and Leu. There were interesting specificity differences between the two enzymes, however. For both the serine and matrix metalloproteinases, catalysis of peptide bond cleavage in insoluble elastin was characterized by temperature effects and water requirements typical of common enzyme-catalyzed reactions, even those involving soluble substrates. In contrast to what has been observed for collagen, the energy requirements for elastolysis were not extraordinary, consistent with cleavage sites in elastin being readily accessible to enzymatic attack.

Elastin is the extracellular matrix protein that imparts elastic recoil to tissues. Its cross-linked nature and extreme hydrophobicity make it one of the most stable proteins in the body (1Shapiro S.D. Endicott S.K. Province M.A. Pierce J.A. Campbell E.J. J. Clin.

A contributing factor to elastin's longevity is its relative resistance to proteolysis by all but a limited number of proteinases that are capable of degrading the mature, insoluble protein under physiological conditions. These enzymes, referred to as elastases, have a wide distribution in nature and are found in animals as well as in plants and bacteria (4Bieth J.G. Mecham R.P. Regulation of Matrix Accumulation.

Neutrophil elastase is found in the azurophil granules of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and is essential for phagocytosis and defense against infection. Pancreatic elastase is stored as an inactive zymogen in the pancreas and is secreted into the intestine where it is activated by other digestive enzymes. Both enzymes cleave peptide bonds on the carboxyl-terminal side of amino acids with a small alkyl side chain, although HLE has a preference for amino acids with longer aliphatic chains at this position (6Bode W.

These proteinases require Zn2+ atoms for activity and in contrast to the serine proteinases cleave peptide bonds on the amino-terminal side of the amino acid that determines specificity. Elastases from Bacillus thermoproteolyticus (thermolysin) and Streptomyces fradiae are four and eight times more active than PPE, respectively, making them some of the most potent elastolytic proteinases reported (5Morihara K.

These groups include 1) the collagenases, 2) the gelatinases or “type IV collagenases,” which include two distinct enzymes of 72 kDa (MMP 2) and 92 kDa (MMP 9), 3) the stromelysins, 4) matrilysin, 5) metalloelastase, and 6) the mT-MMPs containing a membrane-spanning segment in their hemopexin-like domains conferring cell surface localization. Of the known MMPs, the 92- and 72-kDa gelatinases, mouse and human macrophage metalloelastases (HME and MME), and matrilysin degrade insoluble elastin. Matrilysin and the autoprocessed macrophage elastases possess only a catalytic domain, which must also convey binding and catalytic specificity for the elastin substrate. Binding specificity of 92- and 72-kDa gelatinases for elastin, however, resides in the three fibronectin type II-like repeats inserted in tandem in their catalytic domains (10Shipley J.M.

Depletion of cellular cholesterol has been shown to inhibit vitamin uptake by this receptor (Chang, W.-J., Rothberg, K. G., Kamen, B. A., and Anderson, R. G. W. (1993) J. Cell Biol.118, 63–69), suggesting that these domains regulate this process. In this study, the importance of sphingolipids for folate receptor function was investigated in Caco-2 cells using fumonisin B1, a mycotoxin that inhibits the biosynthesis of these lipids. The folate receptor-mediated transport of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate was almost completely blocked in cells in which sphingolipids had been reduced by ∼40%. This inhibition was dependent on the concentration and duration of the treatment with the mycotoxin and was mediated by the sphingolipid decrease. Neither receptor-mediated nor facilitative transport was inhibited by fumonisin B1 treatment, indicating that the effect of sphingolipid depletion was specific for folate receptor-mediated vitamin uptake. A concurrent loss in the total amount of folate binding capacity in the cells was seen as sphingolipids were depleted, suggesting a causal relationship between folate receptor number and vitamin uptake. These findings suggest that dietary exposure to fumonisin B1could adversely affect folate uptake and potentially compromise cellular processes dependent on this vitamin. Furthermore, because folate deficiency causes neural tube defects, some birth defects unexplained by other known risk factors may be caused by exposure to fumonisin B1.

The folate vitamins play an essential role as cofactors in many biochemical reactions involving one-carbon metabolism. These include the biosynthesis of purines and thymidine, the regeneration of methionine from homocysteine, and histidine metabolism. Cellular processes dependent upon folate can be compromised if dietary levels of this vitamin are insufficient or if its transport into cells is affected. Two different systems are used for folate uptake into cells. The first uses a high capacity, low affinity transmembrane transporter known as the reduced folate carrier. The second involves a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) 1The abbreviation used is: GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol. -anchored protein referred to as the folate receptor (1Luhrs C.A. Slomiany B.L.

This high affinity receptor is responsible for the transport of folate into cells of the placenta, kidney, breast, and other tissues with elevated requirements for this vitamin.

In this and other studies, caveolae were equated with membrane domains that could be isolated based on their insolubility in Triton X-100 at 4 °C (5Yu J. Fischman D.A. Steck T.L. J. Supramol. Struct. 1973; 3: 233-248Crossref Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 6Davies A.A. Wigglesworth N.M. Allan D. Owens R.J. Crumpton M.J. Biochem. J. 1984; 219: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and that are enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids (7Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar). More recent evidence has suggested that the Triton X-100-insoluble domains may include caveolae, but are primarily other membrane regions in which the GPI-anchored proteins (including the folate receptor) reside (8Mayor S. Maxfield F.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 929-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Characterization of the protein components of caveolae isolated using new, detergent-free purification schemes has supported the conclusion that GPI-anchored proteins are not enriched in these structures (9Parton R.G. Simons K. Science. 1995; 269: 1398-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 10Schnitzer J.E. McIntosh D.P. Dvorak A.M. Liu J. Oh P. Science. 1995; 269: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Collectively, this evidence suggests that the folate receptor is not in caveolae, and therefore, potocytosis may not be the mechanism by which vitamin transport occurs. Recent evidence suggests that uptake mediated by the folate receptor involves endocytosis (11Birn H. Selhub J. Christensen E.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C302-C310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Rijnboutt S. Jansen G. Posthuma G. Hynes J.B. Schornagel J.H. Strous G.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). However, the association of the folate receptor with Triton X-100-insoluble domains does appear to be important to its function. Depletion of cellular cholesterol through inhibition of its biosynthesis inhibited receptor-mediated folate uptake (13Chang W.-J. Rothberg K.G. Kamen B.A. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 118: 63-69Crossref Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Interpreting these results in the context of potocytosis, Rothberg et al. (14Rothberg K.G. Ying Y.-S. Kamen B.A. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2931-2938Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) suggested that this occurred because the clustering of the folate receptor in caveolae was disrupted. In terms of the effect on the endocytosis of the folate receptor, cholesterol depletion has been found to accelerate the rate at which this protein was recycled to the cell surface. 2S. Mayor and F. R. Maxfield, submitted for publication. How this results in an inhibition of folate uptake is unclear. The importance of sphingolipids, the other lipids enriched in Triton X-100-insoluble domains, for folate receptor function has not yet been investigated, although several studies have probed the importance of these lipids for other GPI-anchored proteins. Inhibition of sphingolipid biosynthesis influenced both the localization of GPI-anchored proteins to these Triton X-100-insoluble domains (15Hanada K. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. Pagano R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6254-6260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) and the transport of newly synthesized GPI-anchored proteins to the Golgi in yeast (16Horvath A. Sutterlin C. Manning-Krieg U. Roa Movva N. Riezman H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3687-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and to the appropriate membrane surface in polarized epithelial cells (17Mays R.W. Siemers K.A. Fritz B.A. Lowe A.W. van Meer G. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1105-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Therefore, the localization, transport, and targeting of these lipids and GPI-anchored proteins appear to be linked (18Futerman A.H. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 377-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In this study, the effects of changes in the cellular levels of sphingolipids on folate receptor-mediated vitamin uptake were investigated in Caco-2 cells. Originally isolated from a human colon adenocarcinoma, Caco-2 cells were chosen for this study because their folate receptor (2Lacey S.W. Sanders J.M. Rothberg K.G. Anderson R.G.W. Kamen B.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and the association of GPI-anchored proteins with Triton X-100-insoluble domains in these cells (19Garcia M. Mirre C. Quaroni A. Reggio H. Le Bivic A. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 1281-1290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have been characterized. Cellular sphingolipids were depleted using fumonisin B1. A mycotoxin produced by the fungus Fusarium moniliforme (20Bezuidenhout, C. S., Gelderblom, W. C. A., Gorstallman, C. P., Horak, R. M., Marasas, W. F. O., Spiteller, G., and Vleggaar, R. (1988)J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 743–745.Google Scholar), fumonisin B1 blocks sphingolipid biosynthesis by inhibiting the reaction catalyzed by sphingosineN-acyltransferase (ceramide synthase) (21Wang E. Norred W.P. Bacon C.W. Riley R.T. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14486-14490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results presented here indicate that sphingolipids play an important role in folate receptor function and that fumonisin B1 could influence cellular folate status through its effects on these membrane lipids. Fetal bovine serum was purchased from Atlanta Biologicals, Inc. RPMI 1640 medium and folate-free RPMI 1640 medium were from Life Technologies, Inc. [3,5,7,9-3H]Folic acid (25–30 Ci/mmol, 99% pure) was obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals. 5-[3′,5′,7,9-3H]Methyltetrahydrofolate (30 Ci/mmol, 97.8% pure) was purchased from Moravek Biochemicals, Inc.125I-Labeled diferric transferrin was from NEN Life Science Products. Lovastatin was a generous gift from Merck. The high performance Silica Gel 60 TLC plates were obtained from Whatman. DEAE-cellulose, charcoal, all lipid standards, and other chemicals were from Sigma. The reagents for the bicinchoninic acid protein assay were purchased from Pierce. Caco-2 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and were routinely grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were plated at 2.5 × 105 cells/25-cm flask or at 8 × 105cells/125-mm flask for quantitation of folate binding and uptake or for analysis of lipids, respectively. After 2 days of growth, the medium was changed to folate-free RPMI 1640 medium and 10% fetal bovine serum such that the cells were maintained under these conditions for a total of 5 days. Treatments were done for the indicated times during this 5-day period such that they ended at the time of analysis. Lovastatin-treated cells were grown in folate-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with lipoprotein-depleted fetal bovine serum prepared as described by Goldstein et al. (22Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). In all cases, the cells were confluent by the end of the experiment, but continued to divide at nearly the same rate as subconfluent cells. Neither the growth rate (as measured by cell counting and [3H]thymidine uptake) nor the viability of the cells (as assessed by trypan blue exclusion) was affected by the treatments (data not shown). Triton X-100-insoluble domains were isolated using the two-step sucrose gradient method described by Arreaza et al. (23Arreaza G. Melkonian K.A. LaFevre-Bernt M. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19123-19127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (8 g/liter NaCl, 0.2 g/liter KCl, 1.15 g/liter Na2HPO4, and 0.2 g/liter KH2PO4) and lysed by the addition of cold TNE buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm EDTA) containing 1% Triton X-100 to the dish. After 20 min of incubation on ice, the cells were scraped from the dish with a rubber policeman and homogenized. The lysate was then adjusted to 40% sucrose with TNE buffer containing 80% sucrose, placed in an ultracentrifuge tube, and overlaid with 5.5 ml of TNE buffer containing 38% sucrose followed by 2 ml of TNE buffer containing 5% sucrose. The samples were ultracentrifuged at 120,000 × g at 37 °C for 15–20 h. The Triton X-100-insoluble membranes visible at the interface between the 5 and 38% sucrose layers were harvested with a syringe, diluted ∼5-fold with TNE buffer, and pelleted by ultracentrifugation (1 h at 120,000 × g at 4 °C). The internalization of the reduced folate derivative into the cytosol was quantitated as described by Smart et al. (24Smart E.J. Foster D.C. Ying Y.-S. Kamen B.A. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated with 5 nm5-[3H]methyltetrahydrofolate (0.5 μCi) in folate-free medium for various amounts of time at 37 °C. The medium was then removed, and the cells were washed four times with cold phosphate-buffered saline before the addition of 1.5 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μm 5-methyltetrahydrofolate) to each flask. The cells were lysed by placing the flasks at −80 °C for 15 min and thawed on ice. The cells were then collected and centrifuged for 20 min at 100,00 × g in an Optima TL ultracentrifuge to separate the membrane (pellet) and cytosolic (supernatant) fractions. The radioactivity in each fraction was quantitated by scintillation counting. Nonspecific uptake was measured using 2.5 μm 5-[3H]methyltetrahydrofolate and subtracted from the total radioactivity to give the specific uptake. The results were normalized to protein determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay of Smith et al. (25Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar). Internalization of125I-labeled diferric transferrin was measured on cells plated in 6-well dishes as described (26McGraw T.E. Maxfield F.R. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) with the following minor modifications. Cells were incubated with medium A (RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin) for 15 min at 37 °C to deplete endogenous transferrin. The cells were then washed once with this medium and incubated in medium A containing 3 μg/ml125I-transferrin at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 2, 4, 6, or 8 min. At the end of the incubation, the cells were placed on ice; the 125I-transferrin-containing medium was removed; and prechilled 0.2 n acetic acid in 0.2 m NaCl was added to each well. After 2 min on ice, this solution was removed, and the cells were washed three times with 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm KCl, and 1 mm MgCl2. The cells were then solubilized with 0.1 n NaOH in phosphate-buffered saline, and an aliquot was counted in a γ-counter to quantitate the internalized transferrin. Surface transferrin was determined by incubating cells with prechilled medium A containing 3 μg/ml125I-transferrin on ice for 30 min, followed by four washes with 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm KCl, and 1 mm MgCl2. The binding of folic acid in solubilized cells and Triton X-100-insoluble fractions was quantitated as described by Antony et al. (27Antony A.C. Utley C. Van Horne K.C. Kolhouse J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9684-9692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the total folate binding capacity, cells were solubilized 25 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 1% octyl glucoside. The Triton X-100-insoluble pellet obtained as described above was solubilized in this octyl glucoside-containing buffer for quantitation of folate receptors in these domains. The different samples were incubated with 5 nm[3H]folate (0.5 μCi) for 20 min at 37 °C to allow ligand binding to the receptor (total volume of 1 ml/tube). The samples were then cooled on ice for 5 min, after which 40 mg of dextran-coated charcoal was added to each tube to absorb unbound radiolabel. After mixing and the addition of 1 ml of 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 1% octyl glucoside, the samples were incubated on ice for 10 min, followed by centrifugation for 30 min at 30,000 × g at 4 °C. Aliquots of the supernatant were then counted by scintillation counting. Nonspecific binding was determined in each experiment by measuring binding in the presence of 2.5 μm[3H]folate (500-fold excess). Lipids were extracted and purified from either whole cells or Triton X-100-insoluble domains using the method of Ariga et al. (28Ariga T. Macala L.J. Saito M. Margolis R.K. Greene L.A. Margolis R.U. Yu R.K. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Cells (2.5 × 108) or the appropriate fraction (isolated from 2.5 × 108cells) was sequentially extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v), and chloroform/methanol/water (30:60:8, v/v). The extracts were then pooled and applied to a DEAE-cellulose column. The neutral lipids were eluted in chloroform/methanol/water (30:60:8, v/v) and passed through a second DEAE-cellulose column to remove contaminants. The acidic lipids were eluted with chloroform, methanol, and 0.8 m sodium acetate (30:60:8, v/v). The neutral lipids were further fractionated on a silica column from which fatty acids and cholesterol were eluted with chloroform and neutral glycosphingolipids and phospholipids were eluted with chloroform/methanol (80:20, v/v). Glycolipids and gangliosides were purified of any contaminating lipids by base hydrolysis followed by re-chromatography on DEAE-cellulose. The lipids were identified and quantitated as described by Brown and Rose (7Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar). Identifications were made by comigration on high performance TLC plates with standards; stability (sphingolipids) or lability (glycerolipids) in base; and reactivity with molybdate reagent (phospholipids), orcinol (glycolipids), or resorcinol (gangliosides). Phospholipids, cholesterol, sulfatides, and cerebrosides were visualized by charring with cupric acetate and quantitated by densitometric scanning and comparison to standards. Gangliosides were detected using resorcinol and quantitated by measuring sialic acid. Neutral glycolipids were visualized with orcinol and quantitated by densitometric scanning and comparison to standards. The thin layer chromatography systems used to resolve the various lipids were as follows: chloroform/methanol/ammonium hydroxide (60:35:8, v/v) for phospholipids; chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/formic acid/water (42:18:7.2:2.4:1.2, v/v) for neutral glycolipids; and chloroform, methanol, and 0.25% KCl (50:45:10, v/v) for gangliosides. Cells were treated with either fumonisin B1 (20 μg/ml (27.7 μm) for 2 days) or lovastatin (25 μm for 3 days) to decrease the cellular sphingolipids or cholesterol, respectively. The specificity and effectiveness of these treatments were assessed by quantitating the major lipids both from whole Caco-2 cells and from the Triton X-100-insoluble domains. These results are shown in TableI. Consistent with the previous results of Brown and Rose (7Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar), the Triton X-100-insoluble domains were found to be enriched in sphingolipids and cholesterol, containing ∼93% of the former and 80% of the latter. Fumonisin B1 treatment significantly reduced the levels of all the measured sphingolipids in both whole cells and the Triton X-100-insoluble domains. Lovastatin treatment specifically decreased cholesterol among the total lipids, but was found to affect the levels of several other lipids (both glycerolipids and sphingolipids) in the Triton X-100-insoluble domains. Overall, both treatments resulted in an ∼20% decrease in the cholesterol/sphingolipid content of the Triton X-100-insoluble domains.Table ILipid composition of control and fumonisin B 1 - and lovastatin-treated cellsLipidWhole cellsTriton X-100-insoluble fractionControlFumonisin B1LovastatinControlFumonisin B1Lovastatinnmol/10 8 cellsnmol/10 8 cellsCholesterol1727 ± 881829 ± 84 (0)1365 ± 60 (21)1388 ± 1121536 ± 86 (0)921 ± 76 (34)TG1-aTG, triglyceride; FA, fatty acid; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PS, phosphatidylserine; CL, cardiolipin; SM, sphingomyelin; Cer, ceramide.475 ± 41388 ± 15 (18)508 ± 16 (0)240 ± 29243 ± 23 (0)204 ± 56 (15)FA1119 ± 1011136 ± 23 (0)1022 ± 172 (9)806 ± 89857 ± 163 (0)777 ± 143 (4)PC2762 ± 1423129 ± 258 (0)2537 ± 110 (8)1234 ± 1291242 ± 213 (0)1015 ± 86 (18)PE1814 ± 501943 ± 49 (0)1777 ± 26 (2)884 ± 951058 ± 97 (0)664 ± 31 (25)PI896 ± 53934 ± 89 (0)945 ± 25 (0)234 ± 50243 ± 99 (0)176 ± 24 (25)PS898 ± 59850 ± 82 (5)1043 ± 25 (0)266 ± 27212 ± 36 (20)280 ± 42 (0)CL429 ± 25424 ± 45 (1)477 ± 25 (0)40 ± 1340 ± 18 (0)34 ± 5 (15)SM1230 ± 38809 ± 30 (34)1167 ± 26 (5)1210 ± 55762 ± 18 (37)1081 ± 80 (11)Ceramides271 ± 19117 ± 17 (57)254 ± 37 (6)239 ± 26110 ± 28 (54)208 ± 35 (13)Sulfatides226 ± 2891 ± 16 (60)284 ± 31 (0)172 ± 1966 ± 9 (62)199 ± 27 (0)Glc-Cer100 ± 1036 ± 10 (64)93 ± 8 (7)87 ± 546 ± 23 (47)74 ± 5 (15)Gal-Cer81 ± 840 ± 13 (51)84 ± 11 (0)71 ± 942 ± 14 (41)61 ± 12 (14)Lac-Cer157 ± 25119 ± 31 (24)144 ± 22 (8)147 ± 28111 ± 36 (24)119 ± 31 (19)Gangliosides45 ± 423 ± 7 (49)52 ± 3 (0)37 ± 421 ± 4 (43)40 ± 8 (0)Caco-2 cells were grown in folate-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum alone (control), 20 μg/ml fumonisin B1 for 2 days, or 25 μm lovastatin for 3 days prior to quantitation of the major lipid species in whole cells and Triton X-100-insoluble domains as described under “Experimental Procedures.” These results represent the means ± S.E. obtained from three separate experiments.

The numbers shown in parentheses are the percentage decrease in the treated groups relative to the control group. The consequences of these changes in membrane lipid composition on folate receptor function were evaluated by measuring the rate of uptake of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate by fumonisin B1- and lovastatin-treated cells. As shown in Fig. 1, the rate of uptake of the vitamin was roughly linear in untreated Caco-2 cells grown in folate-free medium with either normal (Fig. 1,A and B, closed circles) or lipoprotein-depleted (Fig. 1 B, triangles) serum. Uptake was inhibited by ∼90% in the fumonisin B1-treated cells (Fig. 1 A). A similar level of inhibition, which has been reported previously by others (13Chang W.-J. Rothberg K.G. Kamen B.A. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 118: 63-69Crossref Scopus (211) Google Scholar), was observed in the lovastatin-treated cells (Fig. 1 B). Uptake of the vitamin was unaffected in cells treated with fumonisin B1 for only 1 h, indicating that the inhibition was not mediated by the mycotoxin alone. Treatment with either various concentrations of fumonisin B1 for 2 days (Fig. 2 A) or 20 μg/ml for various amounts of time (Fig. 2 B) demonstrated that the inhibition of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate uptake was both concentration- and time-dependent. The sphingolipid levels of these cells also decreased in a concentration- and time-dependent manner (data not shown), establishing that the inhibition of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate uptake in the fumonisin B1-treated cells was mediated by the changes in the sphingolipid composition.Figure 2Concentration and time dependence of fumonisin B1 inhibition of vitamin transport. The rate of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate uptake was determined in Caco-2 cells treated with various concentrations of fumonisin B1(FB 1) for 2 days (A) or with 20 μg/ml fumonisin B1 for 0–3 days (B). The data shown are the means ± S.E. of three experiments, in which each result was determined in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Coupled with the previous reports (13Chang W.-J.

Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2931-2938Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) of the effects of lowering cellular cholesterol on folate transport, the finding that depletion of cellular sphingolipids by fumonisin B1 inhibited this process suggests that the cholesterol/sphingolipid-enriched domains are involved in this effect. To determine if fumonisin B1specifically inhibits processes dependent on these domains, the effect of this mycotoxin on other types of uptake systems was assessed. Facilitative transport was measured by quantitating 2-deoxyglucose uptake. Treatment with fumonisin B1 (20 μg/ml for 2 days) had no effect on the rate of uptake of this glucose analog by Caco-2 cells (data not shown). Receptor-mediated endocytosis was assessed by measuring transferrin uptake. Both the rates of internalization (Fig.3) and externalization (data not shown) of125I-transferrin were found to be very similar in control and fumonisin B1-treated cells. The only difference found was in the amount of surface transferrin binding, which was 2.7 times more in the sphingolipid-depleted groups. While the reason for this difference is unclear, it is responsible for the line representing the fumonisin B1-treated rate of uptake being offset from that of the control cells in Fig. 3. Therefore, transport processes not thought to involve sphingolipid-enriched domains (receptor-mediated endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits and facilitative transport, respectively) were not compromised by changes in the cellular sphingolipid levels. Previous studies of the effect of depletion of cellular cholesterol on folate uptake suggested that this process was compromised because the clustering of the folate receptor in cholesterol/sphingolipid-rich domains in the plasma membrane was disrupted (13Chang W.-J. Rothberg K.G. Kamen B.A. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 118: 63-69Crossref Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 14Rothberg K.G. Ying Y.-S. Kamen B.A. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2931-2938Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). To determine if the decrease in cellular sphingolipids caused by fumonisin B1 affected the folate receptor in a similar manner, the amount of this protein localized in the Triton X-100-insoluble domains was determined. This was accomplished by quantitating the high affinity binding of folic acid in either solubilized whole Caco-2 cells or Triton X-100-insoluble domains. Because folic acid is essentially bound irreversibly by the folate receptor (K d = 0.4 nm (29Kamen B.A. Capdevila A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5983-5987Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar)), the amount of this ligand bound is an approximate measure of the amount of this protein in the cell or fraction. As shown in Fig.4, ∼80% of the folate binding was localized to the Triton X-100-insoluble domains in untreated cells. Surprisingly, the total amount of folate receptor in the cell, but not its localization, was affected in both the fumonisin B1- and lovastatin-treated cells. While ∼50% of the total folate receptor was lost with either sphingolipid or cholesterol depletion, ∼80% of the remaining folate binding was found in the Triton X-100-insoluble domain. As with the inhibition of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate uptake, the decrease in total folate binding was dependent on both the duration of the t"

Although it has been proposed that the mechanism of arrestin quenching of visual transduction is via steric exclusion of transducin binding to phosphorylated light-activated rhodopsin (P-Rh*), direct evidence for this mechanism is lacking. In this study, we investigated both the role of rhodopsin phosphorylation in modulating its interaction with arrestin and transducin and the proposed binding competition between arrestin and transducin for P-Rh*. While the β-adrenergic receptor kinase promotes significant arrestin binding to rhodopsin at a phosphorylation stoichiometry of ≥2 mol/mol, rhodopsin kinase promotes arrestin binding at a stoichiometry of ∼0.9 mol/mol. Moreover, while β-adrenergic receptor kinase phosphorylation of rhodopsin only modestly decreases transducin binding and activation, rhodopsin kinase phosphorylation of rhodopsin significantly decreases transducin binding and activation. Finally, arrestin competes effectively with transducin for binding to P-Rh* (50% inhibition at ∼1:1 molar ratio of arrestin:transducin) but has no effect on transducin binding to nonphosphorylated light-activated rhodopsin (Rh*), paralleling the functional inhibition by arrestin on P-Rh*-stimulated transducin activation (50% inhibition at ∼1.7:1 molar ratio of arrestin:transducin). These results demonstrate that a major role of rhodopsin phosphorylation is to promote high-affinity arrestin binding and decrease transducin binding thus allowing arrestin to effectively compete with transducin for binding to photoactivated rhodopsin.

Phototransduction mediated by the photoreceptor rhodopsin and hormonal transduction mediated by the β-adrenergic receptor (βAR) 1The abbreviations used are: βAR, β-adrenergic receptor; βARK, β-adrenergic receptor kinase; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; ROS, rod outer segment; DTT, dithiothreitol; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate. 1The abbreviations used are: βAR, β-adrenergic receptor; βARK, β-adrenergic receptor kinase; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; ROS, rod outer segment; DTT, dithiothreitol; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate. serve as excellent model systems for investigation of the molecular events underlying agonist-induced receptor desensitization (reviewed in Refs. 1Hargrave P.A.

Phosphorylation of light-activated rhodopsin and hormone-activated βAR by the G protein-coupled receptor kinases rhodopsin kinase and β-adrenergic receptor kinase (βARK), respectively, initiates desensitization and leads to partial uncoupling of receptor-G protein interaction. Rapid and complete uncoupling, however, is accomplished by the subsequent binding of the proteins arrestin and β-arrestin, respectively, to the phosphorylated form of the agonist-activated receptor. Many studies have investigated the effect of receptor phosphorylation on modulating interaction with arrestins. Light-induced binding of visual arrestin to rhodopsin was highly enhanced by rhodopsin phosphorylation (3Kuhn H. Hall S.W. Wilden U. FEBS Lett. 1984; 176: 473-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), and this binding suppressed light-induced cGMP phosphodiesterase activation by rhodopsin (4Wilden U. Hall S.W. Kuhn H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1174-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Although it has been shown that highly phosphorylated rhodopsin is significantly impaired in its ability to activate transducin, addition of arrestin accelerated the recovery process and further suppressed phosphodiesterase activation, most likely by quenching partially phosphorylated rhodopsin species (4Wilden U. Hall S.W. Kuhn H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1174-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 5Bennett N. Sitaramayya A.

(8Puig J. Arendt A. Tomson F.L. Abdulaeva G. Miller R. Hargrave P.A. McDowell J.H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) demonstrated that a heptaphosphopeptide from the C terminus of rhodopsin stimulates arrestin binding to photoactivated forms of rhodopsin, suggesting that at least one function of rhodopsin phosphorylation is to promote high-affinity arrestin interaction with other cytoplasmic regions of rhodopsin. Indeed, the third cytoplasmic domain of rhodopsin appears to be involved in arrestin binding (9Krupnick J.G. Gurevich V.V. Schepers T. Hamm H.E. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3226-3232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The study by Puig et al. (8Puig J. Arendt A. Tomson F.L. Abdulaeva G. Miller R. Hargrave P.A. McDowell J.H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) is consistent with the recently proposed model of strict selectivity of arrestin binding to phosphorylated light-activated rhodopsin (10Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11628-11638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This model proposes that arrestin interaction with both the phosphorylated rhodopsin C terminus and rhodopsin domains that manifest its activation state results in a conformational change from a low-affinity to a high-affinity binding state in which a secondary binding site becomes accessible for interaction with rhodopsin. The corresponding domain in arrestin for interaction with the phosphorylated C terminus of rhodopsin, the “phosphorylation-recognition” domain, has been localized to a discrete region near the middle of the molecule (11Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6010-6016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In hormonal transduction mediated by the βAR, arrestins have been shown to specifically inhibit the signaling of βARK-phosphorylated β2AR (12Benovic J.L. Kuhn H. Codina J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J.

Moreover, in vitro synthesized radiolabeled β-arrestin and arrestin 3 were demonstrated to have high-affinity and selectivity for binding to the phosphorylated form of the β2AR and m2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (16Gurevich V.V.

Similar to the visual arrestin studies, mutagenesis of β-arrestin and arrestin 3 has also identified regions critical for recognition of the phosphorylated state of the receptor (17Gurevich V.V.

The effect of receptor phosphorylation on G protein interaction has not been well characterized. Although several studies have demonstrated a modest to potent functional effect of receptor phosphorylation on G protein activation, it is not known whether this effect is due to attenuated G protein binding to the receptor or subsequent G protein activation. Phosphorylated rhodopsin was demonstrated to have a significantly lower light-induced phosphodiesterase activating capacity than nonphosphorylated rhodopsin (4Wilden U. Hall S.W. Kuhn H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1174-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 18Miller J.L. Fox D.A. Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4983-4988Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and it was subsequently proposed that rhodopsin phosphorylation reduces the binding affinity for transducin (18Miller J.L. Fox D.A. Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4983-4988Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). βARK phosphorylation of the β2AR resulted in a modest functional inhibition of β2AR-stimulated Go GTPase activity (12Benovic J.L. Kuhn H. Codina J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8879-8882Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 15Pitcher J. Lohse M.J. Codina J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3193-3197Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), and phosphorylation of the m2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor by βARK modestly reduced its capacity to stimulate GTPγS binding to Go (19Richardson R.M. Kim C. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13650-13656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of arrestin quenching of rhodopsin signaling is believed to involve steric exclusion of transducin interaction with photoactivated rhodopsin (3Kuhn H. Hall S.W. Wilden U. FEBS Lett. 1984; 176: 473-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 5Bennett N. Sitaramayya A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1710-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 20Schleicher A. Kuhn H. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1770-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In 1984, Kuhn and co-workers (3Kuhn H. Hall S.W. Wilden U. FEBS Lett. 1984; 176: 473-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) demonstrated that excess transducin displaces arrestin from phosphorylated rod outer segment (ROS) membranes suggesting a binding competition between arrestin and transducin for site(s) on the cytoplasmic surface of photoactivated rhodopsin. A quantitative assessment of this competition, however, could not be made due to the crude nature of the protein preparations. Here, we quantitatively characterized the ability of arrestin to compete with transducin for binding to nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated light-activated rhodopsin (Rh* and P-Rh*, respectively) and correlated these results with the functional effects of arrestin on Rh*- and P-Rh*-stimulated transducin activation.

Urea-treated ROS membranes were prepared as described (9Krupnick J.G. Gurevich V.V. Schepers T. Hamm H.E. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3226-3232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with all manipulations carried out on ice under dim red light. Briefly, 50 frozen bovine retinas were resuspended in 50 ml of 10 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4, 65 mmNaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 34% (w/v) sucrose, shaken vigorously and centrifuged at 2000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was diluted with 2 volumes of 10 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4, and centrifuged as above. The crude ROS pellet was resuspended in 30 ml of 10 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.77 m sucrose and further purified on a discontinuous sucrose gradient. The interface between 0.84 and 1.0 m sucrose was collected, diluted 2-fold with 10 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4, and centrifuged at 48,000 × g for 20 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mmEDTA, 5.0 m urea, sonicated on ice for 4 min, diluted with 2 volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min. The pellet was washed three times with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, resuspended in the same buffer, sonicated on ice, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored in the dark at −80 °C. The concentration of rhodopsin was assessed by absorbance at 498 nm using an extinction coefficient of 40,600. Purity of the ROS membrane preparation was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining. ROS membranes were phosphorylated by βARK or rhodopsin kinase. βARK was purified from Sf9 insect cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus as described previously (24Kim C.M. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J. Benovic J.L. Receptor. 1993; 3: 39-55PubMed Google Scholar). Rhodopsin kinase was purified to ∼50% homogeneity by sequential Q-Sepharose and heparin-Sepharose chromatography from Sf9 cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus generously provided by Dr. R. Lefkowitz (Duke University Medical Center). ROS membranes (∼250–300 μg of rhodopsin) were incubated with βARK (∼20–40 μg) or rhodopsin kinase (∼20–40 μg) in 1 ml of 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EGTA, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 2 mm ATP at 30 °C for various times under constant illumination. Phosphorylation reactions were stopped by centrifugation at 50,000 rpm (TLS55 rotor) for 35 min, 4 °C. The resulting pellets were washed with 1.5 ml of 20 mm potassium-Hepes, pH 7.2, 2 mm DTT, thoroughly resuspended in 0.5 ml of the same buffer and sonicated on ice two times for 10 s. Opsin was regenerated by addition of a 3-fold molar excess of 11-cis-retinal and incubation in the dark for 40 min at 37 °C, followed by addition of another 3-fold molar excess of 11-cis-retinal and incubation in the dark for 2 h at 37 °C. Phosphorylated regenerated rhodopsin was aliquoted under dim red light and stored in the dark at −80 °C. Stoichiometry of phosphorylation was measured by incubating 1–2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP with an aliquot of the initial phosphorylation reaction under the exact conditions as described above and quenching with SDS sample buffer followed by electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried and autoradiographed and the radiolabeled rhodopsin bands excised and counted. Phosphorylation stoichiometries were determined assuming that all of the receptors were accessible to kinase. The bovine arrestin cDNA was excised byHpaI/NheI digestion, blunted with Klenow, and ligated into the vector pBluebac which was digested withNheI, blunted with Klenow and treated with phosphatase. To generate a recombinant baculovirus for expression of arrestin, Sf9 insect cells were cotransfected with 1 μg of the recombinant pBluebac arrestin DNA and 1 μg of viral DNA using calcium phosphate precipitation (25Summers, M. D., and Smith, G. E. (1987) Texas Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin No. 1555, 1–56.Google Scholar). Transfected cells were allowed to recover and produce recombinant phage particles in culture media for ∼5 days. The viral supernatant was then used to infect a fresh monolayer of Sf9 cells which was overlaid with 1% low melting agarose in complete media. After 4–5 days, isolated viral plaques were selected for β-galactosidase activity (with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl β-d-galactoside), eluted into complete media and amplified by reinfection of another fresh monolayer of Sf9 cells. Sf9 insect cells were cultured on a monolayer or in suspension (spinner flask, 70 rpm) using TNM-FH medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (2.5 μg/ml fungizone, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 50 μg/ml penicillin). The recombinant arrestin baculovirus was used to infect a monolayer of Sf9 cells (2–2.5 × 107 cells) on four 150-mm plates at a multiplicity of infection of ∼10. Cells were harvested ∼48 h after infection by rinsing several times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then scraping the cells into 5 ml of ice-cold 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 200 μg/ml benzamidine (Buffer A). Cells were lysed with a Brinkmann tissue disruptor (3 × 30 s at 20,000–25,000 rpm) and centrifuged at 20,000 rpm (SS34 rotor) for 30 min, 4 °C. Recombinant arrestin in the resulting supernatant was then purified by sequential Q-Sepharose and heparin-Sepharose chromatography. Briefly, the Sf9 supernatant (20 ml, 30 mg) was diluted 2-fold with 2 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 200 μg/ml benzamidine and then loaded at 0.5 ml/min on a 5-ml Q-Sepharose column equilibrated with Buffer A. The column was washed with Buffer A and arrestin eluted at 1 ml/min with a 120-ml linear gradient of NaCl (0–400 mm) in Buffer A. Peak fractions (between 65 and 150 mm NaCl) were pooled (30 ml, 2–3 mg), the salt concentration adjusted to 200 mmNaCl, and the pooled fractions loaded at 0.25 ml/min on a 1–2-ml heparin-Sepharose column equilibrated with Buffer A in the presence of 200 mm NaCl. The column was washed with 200 mmNaCl in Buffer A and arrestin eluted at 0.5 ml/min with a 40-ml linear gradient of NaCl (200–600 mm) in Buffer A. Peak fractions (between 370 and 470 mm NaCl) were pooled (10 ml, 100 μg), concentrated to 0.25–0.5 ml with an Amicon concentrator, and aliquots were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Arrestin levels and purity were assessed by immunoblotting, using the monoclonal antibody F4C1, and by Coomassie Blue staining of 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Isolation of holotransducin from dark-adapted bovine retinas was performed as described (26Erickson J.W. Mittal R. Cerione R.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8693-8700Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Briefly, ROS membranes were bleached in white light for 30 min, pelleted, and resuspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mmEDTA, 0.3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), repeating the latter manipulation several times. Transducin was then recovered by resuspending the membranes in hypotonic buffer containing 100 μm GTP, incubation on ice for 30 min under constant illumination, and centrifugation. This step was repeated three times and the supernatants pooled, concentrated, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. Purity was assessed by Coomassie Blue staining of a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Arrestin and transducin alone or together were incubated with rhodopsin or phosphorhodopsin for 5 min at 30 °C under constant illumination in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 0.75 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm DTT, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in a total volume of 50 μl. Samples were then placed on ice and loaded, under dim red light, onto 0.2 ml of the above buffer containing 0.2 m sucrose. Following centrifugation at 100,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C, supernatants were removed and the resulting pellets solubilized in 20 μl of SDS sample buffer, electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose for 1 h at 100 V. Transferred proteins were then analyzed using the F4C1 monoclonal arrestin antibody and/or the 116 polyclonal Giα antiserum. The 116 polyclonal Giα antiserum is directed against a C-terminal region of Giα and selectively detects Giα1 ∼ Giα2 and to a lesser extent Giα3 and Gtα (23Carlson K.E. Brass L.F. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13298-13305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Blots were blocked for 30 min with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in Buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20), incubated with a 1:5000 (F4C1) and/or 1:500 (116) dilution of primary antibody in Buffer B with milk for 1 h, washed with Buffer B, incubated for 1 h with a 1:2000 dilution of anti-mouse and/or anti-rabbit secondary antibody (for F4C1 and 116, respectively) in Buffer B with milk, washed with Buffer B, and then visualized using ECL reagent (Amersham) followed by autoradiography. Films were scanned by a densitometer (Molecular Dynamics) and the intensity of immunoreactive bands in experimental samples compared with the intensity of immunoreactive bands in standard samples loaded on the same gel. Nonspecific binding was determined in the absence of rhodopsin and endogenous immunoreactivity determined in the presence of rhodopsin alone. Transducin alone or in the presence of increasing concentrations of arrestin was incubated with rhodopsin or phosphorhodopsin for 5 or 15 min at 30 °C under constant illumination in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mmEGTA, 0.75 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm DTT, 0.2 mm AMP-PNP, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.2 μm [γ-32P]GTP (150–250 cpm/fmol) in a total volume of 50 μl. Reactions were quenched by addition of 25 μl of 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 2.0, and 500 μl of 5% (w/v) activated charcoal and centrifugation for 15 min at 10,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge. Aliquots of the resulting supernatants were counted in a liquid scintillation counter and rhodopsin-stimulated hydrolysis of GTP by transducin determined. Nonspecific hydrolysis of GTP was assessed in the presence of rhodopsin alone (endogenous) and transducin alone (rhodopsin-independent activity). The specific activity (rhodopsin-stimulated activity) of different transducin preparations varied in the range of ∼30–80 fmol/min/μg protein using 50 nm rhodopsin. Since direct evidence for competition between arrestins and G proteins for receptor binding is lacking, we assessed the ability of purified preparations of arrestin and transducin to bind to rhodopsin using a centrifugation binding assay (to isolate rhodopsin-bound proteins). Transducin was purified from bovine retinas using a standard procedure in which transducin is allowed to bind to photoactivated rhodopsin, peripheral proteins are then removed by hypotonic buffer washes and transducin subsequently released by GTP. This protein preparation was estimated to be ≥95% pure (Fig. 1,lane 1). Arrestin was overexpressed in Sf9 insect cells using the baculovirus expression system and purified by sequential Q-Sepharose and heparin-Sepharose chromatography. This protein preparation was judged to be ≥75% pure (Fig. 1, lane 2). The ROS membrane preparation contained ≥90% rhodopsin (Fig. 1,lane 3), and Western analysis indicated negligible endogenous arrestin and transducin (data not shown). Since the expression and purification of arrestin in Sf9 insect cells has not previously been described, we initially investigated the function of this protein. Purified Sf9-expressed arrestin was found to inhibitin vitro synthesized [3H]arrestin binding to P-Rh* with 50% inhibition occurring at an ∼1:1 molar ratio of arrestin:P-Rh* (data not shown), similar to that previously reported for purified bovine retinal arrestin inhibition of [3H]arrestin binding to P-Rh* (27Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21919-21923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We next characterized the binding of purified arrestin to Rh* and P-Rh* preparations containing increasing phosphorylation stoichiometries (Fig. 2). We assessed arrestin binding to rhodopsin phosphorylated by both βARK and rhodopsin kinase since βARK has been reported to phosphorylate rhodopsin on similar sites as rhodopsin kinase (28Benovic J.L. Mayor F. Somers R.L. Caron M.G. Lewfkowitz R.J.

As shown in Fig. 2 A, arrestin displayed minimal binding to Rh* and increasing binding to P-Rh* as the extent of phosphorylation by βARK increased from 1.6 to 4.6 mol/mol. These results are consistent with the general effect of rhodopsin phosphorylation on in vitro synthesized [3H]arrestin binding to βARK-phosphorylated rhodopsin (10Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11628-11638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21919-21923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was recently demonstrated that βARK phosphorylation of rhodopsin to a stoichiometry of ∼2 mol/mol is necessary and sufficient for high-affinity [3H]arrestin binding to rhodopsin (10Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11628-11638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The arrestin binding differences apparent in Fig. 2 A may be explained in light of this study and the observation that a phosphorhodopsin preparation, containing a specific average phosphorylation stoichiometry, is actually a heterogeneous population of rhodopsin molecules where ≥67% of the total molecules contain the average phosphorylation stoichiometry or greater (29Wilden U. Kuhn H. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 3014-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Thus, the modestly enhanced binding of arrestin to P-Rh* (∼4.6 mol/mol) when compared with P-Rh* (∼2.7 mol/mol) is likely due to a greater percentage of rhodopsin molecules in the P-Rh* (∼2.7 mol/mol) preparation containing less than 2 mol/mol stoichiometry. Similarly, the significantly decreased binding of arrestin to P-Rh* (∼1.6 mol/mol) when compared with P-Rh* (∼2.7 mol/mol) is likely due to a significantly greater fraction of rhodopsin molecules in the P-Rh*(∼1.6 mol/mol) preparation containing a phosphorylation stoichiometry of less than 2 mol/mol. Interestingly, arrestin binding to rhodopsin phosphorylated by rhodopsin kinase (RK) to ∼0.9 mol/mol was almost as good as its binding to P-Rh* phosphorylated by RK to 2–3 mol/mol stoichiometries (Fig. 2 B). Moreover, arrestin binding to P-Rh* phosphorylated by RK to ∼0.9 mol/mol was in fact better than its binding to P-Rh* phosphorylated by βARK to ∼1.6 mol/mol. Thus, high-affinity binding of arrestin to RK-phosphorylated rhodopsin appears to require incorporation of only 1 mol of phosphate/mol of rhodopsin. These observations clearly indicate that RK and βARK differ in their initial site of phosphorylation of rhodopsin. Indeed, a recent study (30Palczewski K. Ohguro H. Premont R.T. Inglese J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15294-15298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) demonstrating that the initial C-terminal site phosphorylated by RK and βARK is different, with RK phosphorylating Ser338 first and Ser343 second while βARK has the reverse preference, sheds light on this observed difference in arrestin binding. A plausible explanation is that phosphorylation of Ser338 is necessary and sufficient for high-affinity arrestin binding. Consistent with the apparent requirement of ∼1 mol/mol phosphorylation stoichiometry for high-affinity arrestin binding to RK-phosphorylated rhodopsin, several studies have indicated that one phosphate incorporated into rhodopsin is sufficient for arrestin function. In a functional assay, total rhodopsin inactivation is achieved with a phosphorylation extent of 0.5–1.4 mol/mol (5Bennett N. Sitaramayya A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1710-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Moreover, although arrestin most effectively quenches rhodopsin with a high phosphorylation stoichiometry (∼8 mol/mol), it can still partially quench rhodopsin with a phosphorylation stoichiometry of ∼1 mol/mol (7Wilden U. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1446-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The finding that phosphorylation of Ser338 is likely a key modulator of arrestin binding, along with our recent identification of Arg175 as a key phosphorylation-sensitive trigger in arrestin (11Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6010-6016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 31Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), implies that phosphoserine 338 in rhodopsin may directly interact with Arg175 in arrestin. Moreover, several phosphorylation-independent arrestin mutants bound equally well to P-Rh* and 329G-Rh* (truncated rhodopsin lacking the C-terminal phosphorylation sites), but weakly to Rh* (31Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This suggests that rhodopsin phosphorylation induces a conformational rearrangement involving the C terminus that promotes high-affinity arrestin binding. Since the direct binding of transducin to rhodopsin and phosphorhodopsin has not been well characterized, we next investigated the effect of rhodopsin phosphorylation on this interaction. Similar to the arrestin binding studies, we compared transducin interaction with rhodopsin phosphorylated by either βARK or RK. Phosphorylation of rhodopsin by βARK to ∼4.6 mol/mol modestly reduced transducin binding (Fig. 3 A), correlating with the modest decrease in the ability of βARK-phosphorylated rhodopsin (∼4.6 mol/mol) to stimulate the GTPase activity of transducin (Fig.3 B). Interestingly, similar to the more potent effects of rhodopsin phosphorylation by RK on arrestin binding, phosphorylation by RK also more effectively decreased transducin interaction. Rhodopsin kinase phosphorylation of rhodopsin to ∼0.9 mol/mol significantly decreased transducin binding (Fig. 3 C), correlating with a significant reduction in RK-phosphorylated P-Rh*-stimulated transducin GTPase activity (Fig. 3 D). The more potent effect on transducin interaction of rhodopsin phosphorylation by RK compared with βARK is highlighted by the observation that the decrease in transducin binding and activation is more pronounced with the RK-phosphorylated P-Rh* than the βARK- phosphorylated P-Rh*. The significant decrease in transducin activation by RK phosphorylation of rhodopsin is consistent with the desensitization observed in arrestin-knockout mice (32Dodd R.L. Makino C.L. Xu J. Chen J. Simon M.I. Baylor D.A. Invest. Opthalm. Vis. Sci. 1996; 37 (abstr.): 55Google Scholar). This is the first study to date to correlate the reduced ability of the phosphorylated receptor to both bind and activate the G protein. Although it has been proposed that phosphorylation of rhodopsin reduces its binding affinity for transducin (18Miller J.L. Fox D.A. Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4983-4988Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), evidence to support this is lacking. Multiple studies have demonstrated that the rhodopsin domains most critical for transducin binding are the second and third cytoplasmic loops (33Franke R.R. Sakmar T.P. Graham R.M. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14767-14774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Franke R.R. Sakmar T.P. Oprian D.D. Khorana H.G. J. Biol.

Science. 1990; 250: 123-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 36Fahmy K. Sakmar T.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7227-7236Google Scholar). Moreover, one study has suggested involvement of the C terminus of rhodopsin in transducin interaction (37Phillips W.J. Cerione R.A. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), although truncation mutagenesis suggested that the C terminus is not absolutely required for transducin interaction (38Weiss E.R. Osawa S. Shi W. Dickerson C.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7587-7593Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Possible explanations for reduced transducin binding to phosphorhodopsin are that phosphorylation of the C terminus may directly decrease transducin interaction with the C terminus or it may result in a conformational change that alters the accessibility of other cytoplasmic regions of rhodopsin critical for transducin interaction. The more potent effects on transducin interaction by RK compared with βARK phosphorylation of rhodopsin again suggests mechanistic differences in the manner in which these G protein-coupled receptor kinases phosphorylate rhodopsin. In light of the study indicating that RK initially phosphorylates Ser338 (30Palczewski K. Ohguro H. Premont R.T. Inglese J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15294-15298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), these results strongly suggest that phosphorylation of Ser338 is a key modulator of both transducin and arrestin interaction. Since βARK phosphorylation of rhodopsin to a high stoichiometry only modestly decreased transducin interaction, the sequential order of phosphorylation of rhodopsin may be more critical for modulating transducin interaction than phosphorylation of Ser338 per se. It is conceivable that initial phosphorylation of Ser338 is required for a specific conformational change to occur that significantly decreases transducin interaction. Thus, monophosphorhodopsin phosphorylated on Ser338 may exist in a conformation particularly unfavorable for transducin interaction, a conformation that is subsequently maintained throughout further phosphorylation of rhodopsin by RK. However, in the case of βARK phosphorylation of rhodopsin, this unique change may not occur since Ser343 is phosphorylated before Ser338. Using the purified preparations of arrestin and transducin, we next investigated whether these proteins compete for binding to rhodopsin. Since βARK-phosphorylated rhodopsin demonstrates both high-affinity binding to arrestin and a modest reduction in transducin interaction, we assessed the binding competition with this form of phosphorylated rhodopsin. Increasing concentrations of arrestin were incubated with transducin and either Rh* or P-Rh* (∼4.6 mol/mol), and rhodopsin-bound arrestin and transducin were then isolated by centrifugation through a 0.2 m sucrose cushion. The proteins were resolved by electrophoresis and binding quantitated by immunoblotting using arrestin and Giα antibodies. It can be clearly observed that as arrestin binding to P-Rh*increased, transducin binding decreased (Fig.4 A). Arrestin competed with transducin for binding to P-Rh* with 50% inhibition occurring at a molar ratio of arrestin:transducin of ∼1:1 (∼50 nm arrestin) and maximal inhibition of ∼80% at the highest concentration of arrestin (Fig. 4 B). Arrestin, however, did not compete with transducin for binding to Rh* (Fig. 4 B), consistent with its low affinity for nonphosphorylated rhodopsin (Fig.2 A and Refs. 10Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11628-11638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 27Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21919-21923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To our knowledge, this represents the first time that an arrestin protein has been shown to directly inhibit G protein binding to the phosphorylated form of an agonist-activated receptor, thus providing direct evidence for the binding competition mechanism first proposed by Kuhn et al. (3Kuhn H. Hall S.W. Wilden U. FEBS Lett. 1984; 176: 473-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Similar to the demonstration that excess transducin displaces arrestin from binding to highly phosphorylated ROS membranes (3Kuhn H. Hall S.W. Wilden U. FEBS Lett. 1984; 176: 473-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), these results suggest that arrestins and G proteins compete for binding to a common site(s) on the phosphorylated receptor. Based on our previous results that the third cytoplasmic domain of rhodopsin is critical for rhodopsin-arrestin interaction (9Krupnick J.G. Gurevich V.V. Schepers T. Hamm H.E. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3226-3232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), at least one of these overlapping binding site(s) is likely to be the third cytoplasmic loop of rhodopsin. To assess whether the observed binding competition between arrestin and transducin for phosphorhodopsin can fully explain the functional effect of arrestin on phosphorhodopsin-stimulated transducin activation, we correlated the observed binding competition with the functional inhibition of arrestin on phosphorhodopsin-stimulated transducin GTPase activity. Arrestin inhibited P-Rh*-stimulated transducin GTPase activity with 50% inhibition occurring at a molar ratio of arrestin:transducin of ∼1.7:1 (∼85 nm arrestin) and maximal inhibition of ∼70% at the highest concentration of arrestin (Fig. 4 C), comparable to the half-maximal value and maximal inhibition observed in the binding competition experiments. Arrestin, however, had no effect on Rh*-stimulated transducin GTPase activity (Fig. 4 C), consistent with its inability to compete with transducin for binding to this form of rhodopsin (Fig.4 B). The molar ratio of arrestin:P-Rh* required for 50% inhibition in the functional studies here correlates well with the molar ratio of arrestin:receptor required for 50% inhibition in functional studies reported elsewhere (12Benovic J.L. Kuhn H. Codina J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8879-8882Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 13Lohse M.J. Benovic J.L. Codina J. Caron M.G.

Chem. 1992; 267: 17882-17890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results thus indicate that the observed binding competition between arrestin and transducin for interaction with phosphorylated rhodopsin is able to explain the functional effects of arrestin on inhibiting phosphorhodopsin-stimulated transducin activation. In summary, we investigated the proposed mechanism of action of arrestins (involving a binding competition with G proteins for the phosphorylated agonist-activated receptor) and correlated these results with the functional effects of arrestins on receptor-stimulated G protein activation. We also characterized the direct effect of receptor phosphorylation on interaction with both arrestins and G proteins. Our results demonstrate: 1) phosphorylation of rhodopsin greatly enhances arrestin binding and reduces transducin binding and activation; 2) RK is more effective than βARK at phosphorylating rhodopsin and modulating its interaction with arrestin and transducin; and 3) arrestin competes with transducin for binding to P-Rh*paralleling the functional inhibition of arrestin on P-Rh*-stimulated transducin activation. Finally, the data presented here raise the intriguing possibility that phosphorylation of GPRs to different stoichiometries with various G protein-coupled receptor kinases, and then assessment of the effect on GPR interaction with arrestins and G proteins, may be a viable approach for investigation of the specificity of GPR interaction with G protein-coupled receptor kinases and arrestins.

Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 230-235PubMed Google Scholar) perhaps indicates that only relevant neuronal cell lines derived from the leptin-responsive hypothalamus cells will be useful for revealing the mechanism of signal transduction by the LepR and for understanding the eventual role of other mediators such as glucose, insulin, and glucocorticoids in leptin signaling. The extracellular part of the LepR contains 820 amino acids and includes two immunoglobulin-cytokine receptor homologous (CRH) regions followed by two fibronectin III-like domains (see Fig. 5). As for other members of the cytokine receptor family, it was suggested that dimerization of the cytoplasmic region of the LepR is required for signal transduction. Chimeras consisting of the extracellular domain of the G-CSF receptor and the cytoplasmic domain of the LepR were able to activate a reporter in HepG2 cells after treatment with G-CSF (27White D.W.

Moreover, transfection into BAF/3 cells of a plasmid construct encoding a full-length LepR, or a chimera consisting of the extracellular domain of the human growth hormone receptor fused to the cytoplasmic domain of the LepR (18Bennett B.D. Solar G.P. Yuan J.Q. Mathias J. Thomas G.R. Matthews W. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1170-1180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), was able to transfer leptin or growth hormone-dependent proliferation to these cells. It has been shown (27White D.W. Kuropatwinski K.K. Devos R. Baumann H. Tartaglia L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4065-4071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) that only weak dominant negative inhibition of LepR LF-mediated receptor activation was obtained when the LepR SF was co-expressed.In this study we have analyzed the binding properties of leptin to its receptor and the oligomerization of the LepR through chemical cross-linking. Using cross-linking, we were unable to demonstrate the presence of heterodimeric complexes between the LepR LF and SF. This suggests that the different isoforms of the LepR remain segregated at the cell surface as dimers and oligomers. We show that recombinant soluble LepR exists as a dimer in solution, supporting the hypothesis that membrane-bound LepR exists as a preformed dimer. Analysis of the LepR-leptin complex by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and determination of the amino acid composition demonstrated that the LepR binds leptin in a 1:1 ratio.DISCUSSIONBoth short and long isoforms of the LepR are present in the brain and in peripheral tissues (17Ghilardi N. Ziegler S. Wiestner A. Stoffel R. Heim M.H. Skoda R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6231-6235Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). The identification of the LepR splicing defect in db/db mice (13Chen H. Charlat O. Tartaglia L.A. Woolf E.A. Weng X. Ellis S.J. Lakey N.D. Culpepper J. Moore K.J. Breitbart R.E. Duyk G.M. Tepper R.I. Morgenstern J.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 491-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1918) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the long form of the LepR is responsible for the observed metabolic changes induced by leptin in ob/ob mice. We have shown previously that like the receptors for other cytokines such as erythropoietin, G-CSF, and growth hormone, the LepR probably also signals through homo-oligomerization (27White D.W. Kuropatwinski K.K. Devos R. Baumann H. Tartaglia L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4065-4071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In this report we show through chemical cross-linking of leptin that both the long and short isoforms of the LepR expressed on COS-1 cells exist as homodimer and homo-oligomer complexes. The observation that the expressed extracellular domain of the LepR is a dimer suggests that the membrane-bound receptor might also exist as a preformed homodimer complex in the absence of leptin. It was previously suggested that dominant negative repression by the LepR SF isoform could be responsible for the observed lack of leptin-induced STAT activation in peripheral tissues (25Vaisse C. Halaas J.L. Horvath C.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stoffel M. Friedman J.M. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar), in contrast to the hypothalamus where the LepR LF isoform is more abundant. However, the LepR SF inhibited only slightly the signaling of the LepR LF when both are co-expressed (27White D.W. Kuropatwinski K.K. Devos R. Baumann H. Tartaglia L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4065-4071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to the G-CSFR, where as predicted for receptor activation through ligand-induced homodimerization, a signaling deficient homodimerization partner inhibits the signaling of the full-length G-CSFR, probably through heterodimerization. Hetero-oligomerization between different co-expressed receptor mutants has been observed for other receptors that exist as stable dimers, such as the Na+/H+ exchanger (30Fafournoux P. Noël J. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2589-2596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we showed that chemical cross-linking of leptin to COS-1 cells transfected with both LepR isoforms gave no evidence for heterodimer formation. These data therefore suggest that the LepR may exist as preformed homo-oligomer complexes and that the different isoforms do not mix at the cell surface when co-expressed. We can only speculate why the LepR does not form heterodimer complexes when both are co-expressed in the same cell. Possibly, accessory proteins associate with the cytoplasmic tail of the LepR LF preventing it to associate with the LepR SF, or vice versa. Alternatively, dimerization could occur prior to the time when receptors are free to diffuse in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, allowing dimerization with their nearest neighbor only. Such a mechanism would favor the formation of homodimers rather than heterodimers. A third possibility is that the two forms are specifically sorted to different cellular compartments before being transported to the plasma membrane. When BAF/3 cells are transfected with a receptor chimera consisting of the mLepR extracellular domain fused to the cytoplasmic domain of the human gp130 receptor chain, all cells become growth factor-independent. 3J. Van der Heyden, unpublished results. This observation indicates that constitutive activation of the gp130 is obtained through ligand-independent dimerization of the LepR and again suggests that the LepR is present at the cell membrane as a homodimer.We have expressed the extracellular domain of the LepR in insect cells. This protein (smLepR) was purified as a dimer after leptin affinity and gel filtration chromatography. Gel filtration of in vivolabeled smLepR (not shown) indicated that smLepR is secreted as a dimer in the supernatant of the insect cells and supports our view that the LepR extracellular domain exhibits self-association into dimers and oligomers in the absence of leptin. After gel filtration the smLepR-leptin complex eluted mainly at a position of a molecular mass corresponding to a homodimer complex. The smLepR was fully competent for leptin binding as demonstrated by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. From these experiments, and from the determined total amino acid composition of the complex, we calculated a stoichiometry of one leptin molecule per sLepR molecule (or two leptin molecules per sLepR dimer). Analysis of the cross-linked products between leptin and smLepR by SDS-PAGE again showed evidence for the presence of a receptor homodimer complex. Our results are in agreement with a model where, as for the G-CSFR (31Horan T. Wen J. Narhi L. Parker V. Garcia A. Arakawa T. Philo J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4886-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), dimerization of the LepR occurs through receptor-receptor interaction. In contrast to the G-CSFR, however, dimerization of the LepR is not induced by ligand. Further work will be required to determine whether, as for G-CSFR, each leptin receptor molecule in the dimer interacts with only one molecule of ligand (model 1) or whether they can interact with both ligand molecules (models 2 and 3). Our results are in agreement with the findings of Nakashimaet al. (32Nakashima K. Narazaki M. Taga T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that the membrane-bound LepR is present as homo-oligomers in the absence of leptin. Elucidation of the mechanism of segregation between the different isoforms may help to understand the mechanism of leptin-induced receptor activation in the hypothalamus. Leptin, the product of the obese gene (1Zhang Y. Proenca R. Maffei M. Barone M. Leopold L. Friedman J.M. Nature. 1994; 372: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (11625) Google Scholar), is a 146-amino acid protein secreted by fat cells into the bloodstream. Administration of recombinant leptin to ob/ob mice, which are deficient in the production of leptin, causes a reduction in food intake and weight loss (2Campfield L.A. Smith F.J. Guisez Y. Devos R.

It is therefore not surprising that the molecular cloning of the leptin receptor (LepR) 1The abbreviations used are: LepR, leptin receptor; CRH, cytokine receptor homologous; DSS, disuccinimidyl suberate; G-CSF, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor; LF, long form; R, receptor; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; SF, short form; smLepR, soluble mouse leptin receptor; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription. 1The abbreviations used are: LepR, leptin receptor; CRH, cytokine receptor homologous; DSS, disuccinimidyl suberate; G-CSF, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor; LF, long form; R, receptor; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; SF, short form; smLepR, soluble mouse leptin receptor; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription. cDNA revealed that it belongs to the cytokine receptor family (6Tartaglia L.A.

In situ hybridization experiments revealed that this longer form, thought to be the signaling receptor, is present in the hypothalamus (15Mercer J.G. Hoggard N. Williams L.M. Lawrence C.B. Hannah L.T. Trayhurn P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 387: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar), and experiments using radiolabeled leptin demonstrated clear binding to the arcuate nucleus and median eminence of the hypothalamus (16Banks W.A. Kastin A.J. Huang W. Jaspan J.B. Maness L.M. Peptides ( Elmsford ). 1996; 17: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). Moreover, RNase protection experiments showed that among the many tissues examined, the hypothalamus has the highest ratio of long versus short isoform of the LepR (17Ghilardi N. Ziegler S. Wiestner A. Stoffel R. Heim M.H. Skoda R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6231-6235Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). Most studies on the LepR are focused on its central action, although recent findings indicate a possible role for the LepR in hematopoiesis (18Bennett B.D. Solar G.P. Yuan J.Q. Mathias J. Thomas G.R.

Lim M.E. Lu R. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 318-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1390) Google Scholar) underscore the importance of leptin for the release of pituitary hormones regulated by the hypothalamus. Little is known on the mechanism of signal transduction by the LepR. Transient transfection of the long isoform (LF) of the LepR into COS-1 cells and hepatoma cell lines has been used to identify the STATS activated by leptin (17Ghilardi N. Ziegler S. Wiestner A.

Recently, it was demonstrated that leptin only induces the activation of STAT3 in the hypothalamus ofob/ob and wild-type mice, and no STAT activation could be detected in the other tissues tested (25Vaisse C.

Kuropatwinski K.K. Devos R. Baumann H. Tartaglia L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4065-4071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In this report we show through chemical cross-linking of leptin that both the long and short isoforms of the LepR expressed on COS-1 cells exist as homodimer and homo-oligomer complexes. The observation that the expressed extracellular domain of the LepR is a dimer suggests that the membrane-bound receptor might also exist as a preformed homodimer complex in the absence of leptin. It was previously suggested that dominant negative repression by the LepR SF isoform could be responsible for the observed lack of leptin-induced STAT activation in peripheral tissues (25Vaisse C. Halaas J.L. Horvath C.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stoffel M. Friedman J.M. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar), in contrast to the hypothalamus where the LepR LF isoform is more abundant. However, the LepR SF inhibited only slightly the signaling of the LepR LF when both are co-expressed (27White D.W. Kuropatwinski K.K. Devos R. Baumann H. Tartaglia L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4065-4071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to the G-CSFR, where as predicted for receptor activation through ligand-induced homodimerization, a signaling deficient homodimerization partner inhibits the signaling of the full-length G-CSFR, probably through heterodimerization. Hetero-oligomerization between different co-expressed receptor mutants has been observed for other receptors that exist as stable dimers, such as the Na+/H+ exchanger (30Fafournoux P. Noël J. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2589-2596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we showed that chemical cross-linking of leptin to COS-1 cells transfected with both LepR isoforms gave no evidence for heterodimer formation. These data therefore suggest that the LepR may exist as preformed homo-oligomer complexes and that the different isoforms do not mix at the cell surface when co-expressed. We can only speculate why the LepR does not form heterodimer complexes when both are co-expressed in the same cell. Possibly, accessory proteins associate with the cytoplasmic tail of the LepR LF preventing it to associate with the LepR SF, or vice versa. Alternatively, dimerization could occur prior to the time when receptors are free to diffuse in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, allowing dimerization with their nearest neighbor only. Such a mechanism would favor the formation of homodimers rather than heterodimers. A third possibility is that the two forms are specifically sorted to different cellular compartments before being transported to the plasma membrane. When BAF/3 cells are transfected with a receptor chimera consisting of the mLepR extracellular domain fused to the cytoplasmic domain of the human gp130 receptor chain, all cells become growth factor-independent. 3J. Van der Heyden, unpublished results. This observation indicates that constitutive activation of the gp130 is obtained through ligand-independent dimerization of the LepR and again suggests that the LepR is present at the cell membrane as a homodimer. We have expressed the extracellular domain of the LepR in insect cells. This protein (smLepR) was purified as a dimer after leptin affinity and gel filtration chromatography. Gel filtration of in vivolabeled smLepR (not shown) indicated that smLepR is secreted as a dimer in the supernatant of the insect cells and supports our view that the LepR extracellular domain exhibits self-association into dimers and oligomers in the absence of leptin. After gel filtration the smLepR-leptin complex eluted mainly at a position of a molecular mass corresponding to a homodimer complex. The smLepR was fully competent for leptin binding as demonstrated by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. From these experiments, and from the determined total amino acid composition of the complex, we calculated a stoichiometry of one leptin molecule per sLepR molecule (or two leptin molecules per sLepR dimer). Analysis of the cross-linked products between leptin and smLepR by SDS-PAGE again showed evidence for the presence of a receptor homodimer complex. Our results are in agreement with a model where, as for the G-CSFR (31Horan T. Wen J. Narhi L. Parker V. Garcia A. Arakawa T. Philo J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4886-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), dimerization of the LepR occurs through receptor-receptor interaction. In contrast to the G-CSFR, however, dimerization of the LepR is not induced by ligand. Further work will be required to determine whether, as for G-CSFR, each leptin receptor molecule in the dimer interacts with only one molecule of ligand (model 1) or whether they can interact with both ligand molecules (models 2 and 3). Our results are in agreement with the findings of Nakashimaet al. (32Nakashima K. Narazaki M. Taga T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that the membrane-bound LepR is present as homo-oligomers in the absence of leptin. Elucidation of the mechanism of segregation between the different isoforms may help to understand the mechanism of leptin-induced receptor activation in the hypothalamus. We thank T. Tuypens, A.

https://openalex.org/W2035648799,"Mature protein kinase C is phosphorylated at a conserved carboxyl-terminal motif that contains a Ser (or Thr) bracketed by two hydrophobic residues; in protein kinase C βII, this residue is Ser-660 (Keranen, L. M., Dutil, E. M., and Newton, A. C. (1995) Curr. Biol. 5, 1394–1403). This contribution examines how negative charge at this position regulates the function of protein kinase C. Specifically, Ser-660 in protein kinase C βII was mutated to Ala or Glu and the enzyme's stability, membrane interaction, Ca2+ regulation, and kinetic parameters were compared with those of wild-type protein phosphorylated at residue 660. Negative charge at this position had no significant effect on the enzyme's diacylglycerol-stimulated membrane interaction nor the conformational change accompanying membrane binding. In contrast, phosphate caused a 10-fold increase in the enzyme's affinity for Ca2+ and a comparable increase in its affinity for phosphatidylserine, two interactions that are mediated by the C2 domain. Negative charge also increased the protein's thermal stability and decreased its K m for ATP and peptide substrate. These data indicate that phosphorylation at the extreme carboxyl terminus of protein kinase C structures the active site so that it binds ATP and substrate with higher affinity and structures determinants in the regulatory region enabling higher affinity binding of Ca2+. The motif surrounding Ser-660 in protein kinase C βII is found in a number of other kinases, suggesting interactions promoted by phosphorylation of the carboxyl terminus may provide a general mechanism for stabilizing kinase structure. Mature protein kinase C is phosphorylated at a conserved carboxyl-terminal motif that contains a Ser (or Thr) bracketed by two hydrophobic residues; in protein kinase C βII, this residue is Ser-660 (Keranen, L.

The motif surrounding Ser-660 in protein kinase C βII is found in a number of other kinases, suggesting interactions promoted by phosphorylation of the carboxyl terminus may provide a general mechanism for stabilizing kinase structure. Phosphorylation is a widely used mechanism for reversibly regulating protein structure and function. Conformational or electrostatic changes promoted by phosphorylation modulate the enzymatic activity and macromolecular interactions of a plethora of cellular proteins (1Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar). Since the discovery 4 decades ago that phosphorylation activates phosphorylase kinase (2Krebs E.G. Graves D.J. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 2867-2873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it has been clearly established that phosphorylation serves as a general mechanism for regulating kinase function (1Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar, 3Johnson L.N. Noble M.E.M. Owen D.J.

Structure. 1994; 2: 345-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Best characterized is the requirement for negative charge on the activation loop of kinases that renders the kinase core competent for catalysis (3Johnson L.N. Noble M.E.M. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar, 4Taylor S.S. Radzio-Andzelm E. Structure. 1994; 2: 345-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation has recently been shown to play an essential role in regulating the protein kinase Cs (5Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 6Tsutakawa S.E. Medzihradszky K.F. Flint A.J. Burlingame A.L. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26807-26812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These enzymes transduce the myriad of signals promoting phospholipid hydrolysis (7Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2357) Google Scholar). They are recruited to membranes upon the production of diacylglycerol and, for the conventional isoforms, increased Ca2+ concentrations. Binding of these cofactors results in a conformational change that removes an autoinhibitory (pseudosubstrate) domain from the active site, thus promoting substrate binding and phosphorylation (8Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1468) Google Scholar). It was recently established that protein kinase C is multiply phosphorylatedin vivo and that these phosphorylations are required to process newly synthesized protein kinase C into the mature, cofactor-responsive enzyme that has been extensively studied over the past 2 decades (5Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 6Tsutakawa S.E. Medzihradszky K.F. Flint A.J. Burlingame A.L. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26807-26812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Mass spectrometric analysis established that the protein kinase C present in the detergent-soluble fraction of cell or tissue extracts is phosphorylated at three conserved positions, with non-phosphorylated or partially phosphorylated forms partitioning exclusively in the detergent-insoluble fraction (5Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). In protein kinase C βII, these phosphorylation sites are Thr-500, Thr-641, and Ser-660 (5Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 6Tsutakawa S.E. Medzihradszky K.F. Flint A.J. Burlingame A.L. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26807-26812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Based on distinct electrophoretic mobility shifts resulting from these phosphorylations and the use of antibodies selective for dephosphorylated Ser-660, the order of phosphorylations was established to be Thr-500, followed by Thr-641, followed by Ser-660 (5Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Each of these phosphorylatable residues has an analogue in other protein kinases: Thr-500 aligns with the activation loop phosphorylatable residue found in many protein kinases (including Thr-197 in protein kinase A (4Taylor S.S. Radzio-Andzelm E. Structure. 1994; 2: 345-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar)), Thr-641 has an analogous site on protein kinase A (S338) (9Yonemoto, W., McGlone, M. L., and Taylor, S. S. (1997) Protein Eng., in press.Google Scholar), and Ser-660 is part of a hydrophobic phosphorylation motif present in diverse kinases such as S6 kinase and protein kinase B (Akt kinase) that has the consensus sequence FXXF(S/T)(F/Y) (10Pearson R.B.

Keyse S.M. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 283-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The first phosphorylation event, occurring on the activation loop, appears to be catalyzed by an unidentified protein kinase C kinase (5Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar,12Cazaubon S. Bornancin F. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), whereas the two carboxyl-terminal phosphorylations are autophosphorylations (13Flint A.J. Paladini R.D. Koshland Jr., D.E. Science. 1990; 249: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 14Newton A.C. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 29359-29362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at the activation loop is required to initiate the processing of inactive protein kinase C to the cofactor-activable, mature form (12Cazaubon S. Bornancin F. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 16Orr J.W. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27715-27718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Cazaubon S.M. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17559-17563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, once the mature, carboxyl-terminal phosphorylated enzyme is formed, the requirement for negative charge at the activation loop is relieved (5Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The second phosphorylation event, occurring on the first carboxyl-terminal site, Thr-641, has been proposed to be critical to the catalytic function of protein kinase C (5Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), to allow the release of protein kinase C from the detergent-insoluble fraction of cells (18Zhang J. Wang L. Schwartz J. Bond R.W. Bishop W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19578-19584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and to stabilize protein kinase C (19Bornancin F. Parker P.J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1114-1123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Although most of the phosphorylation sites are conserved throughout the protein kinase C family, some isozymes contain a Glu in place of a phosphorylatable residue in the hydrophobic motif (5Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Furthermore, protein kinase C δ, which has the most divergent activation loop sequence, does not require phosphorylation of the residue corresponding to Thr-500 in protein kinase C βII for the formation of mature, activable enzyme (20Stempka L. Girod A. Müller H.-J. Rincke G. Marks F. Gschwendt M. Bossemeyer D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6805-6811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This contribution explores the role of the final phosphorylation event, that at position Ser-660, in regulating protein kinase C βII. Specifically, Ser-660 was mutated to Glu (present in two other isozymes (5Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar)) to mimic the effect of phosphate or Ala to mimic the neutral, non-phosphorylated residue. Kinetic and binding analyses reveal that negative charge at this position markedly increases the stability of the enzyme, its affinity for substrate, and its affinity for Ca2+. These data reveal that phosphorylation at this carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic motif plays a role in structuring both the kinase core and determinants in the regulatory domain. Bovine brain l-α-phosphatidylserine, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylserine, andsn-1,2-dioleoylglycerol were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. Dithiothreitol (DTT), 1The abbreviation used is: DTT, dithiothreitol. HEPES, EGTA, trypsin (type XIII from bovine pancreas 10 units μg−1), and ATP were from Sigma. [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci mmol−1) and [3H]dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine were from NEN Life Science Products, and calcium chloride (analytical grade) was from J. T. Baker, Inc. Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies and bovine serum albumin were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. Chemiluminescence SuperSignal substrates were from Pierce. Lipofectin reagent was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. and BaculoGold DNA was from Pharmingen. A protein kinase C-selective peptide (Ac-FKKSFKL-NH2; (21Chakravarthy B.R. Bussey A. Whitfield J.F. Sikorska M. Williams R.E. Durkin J.P. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 196: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar)) was synthesized by the Indiana University Biochemistry Biotechnology Facility. All other chemicals were reagent grade. A polyclonal antibody against the bacterially expressed catalytic domain of protein kinase C βII was a gift from Drs. Andrew Flint and Daniel E. Koshland, Jr. Expression vectors encoding the cDNA sequence of protein kinase C βII with mutation of Ser-660 to Ala or Glu were made by polymerase chain reaction using protein kinase C βII in the pBluescript vector (pbluePKC) as the template. The sense primer used for both mutants was GGAGCATGCATTTTTCCG and contains anNsiI restriction site. Antisense primers corresponding to the sequence around the codon for Ser-660 and containing the necessary nucleic acid changes to encode the desired mutation were CAGAGTTAACAAAGGCAAATCCTTCGAATTCTG (S660A mutation) and CAGAGTTAACAAACTCAAATCCTTCGAATTCTG (S660E mutation). These antisense primers contain an HpaI restriction site. The polymerase chain reaction product and the pbluePKC template were digested with NsiI and HpaI (unique sites in pbluePKC), and the products were gel-purified and ligated together. The mutant protein kinase C gene was then subcloned into the pVL1393 (Invitrogen) baculovirus transfer vector using XbaI andSmaI (see below). The sequence of all mutants was verified by DNA sequencing. Sf21 insect cells were cotransfected with the baculoviral transfer vectors encoding the protein kinase C mutants and linearized wild-type baculovirus DNA (BaculoGold, Pharmingen) by liposome-mediated transfection. Isolated recombinant baculovirus was obtained by plaque purification and amplified by two rounds of propagation in insect cells as described in a manual from Pharmingen for the BaculoGold expression system (Pharmingen, San Diego). Sf21 insect cells were then infected with high titer (1 × 108 plaque-forming units ml−1) baculovirus encoding wild-type protein kinase C βII or its mutants. The cells were harvested after 3 days at 27 °C and lysed by homogenization in buffer containing 50 mmHEPES (pH 7.4), 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 85 μmleupeptin, 2 mm benzamidine, and 0.2 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (lysis buffer). A portion of the lysate was retained, and the remainder was centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C (TLA 120.2, Beckman). The pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer, and lysate, supernatant (detergent-soluble), and pellet (detergent-insoluble) fractions were diluted 2-fold in glycerol and stored at −20 °C. All experiments were performed using the high speed, detergent-soluble supernatants. Aliquots of cell lysate, detergent-soluble supernatant, or detergent-insoluble pellet from Sf21 cells expressing wild-type protein kinase C βII or the Ser-660 mutants were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7% polyacrylamide unless otherwise stated). The proteins were then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Immobilon-P, Millipore) and probed with antibodies to the catalytic domain of protein kinase C βII and peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Labeling was detected using chemiluminescence. Protein kinase C activity in 1–3 μl of detergent-soluble fractions was assayed by measuring the rate of phosphorylation of a synthetic peptide in the presence or absence of brain phosphatidylserine, diacylglycerol, and Ca2+, as described (22Orr J.W. Keranen L.M. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15263-15266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 50 μm (or indicated amounts) protein kinase C-selective peptide in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5 at 30 °C), 1 mm DTT, 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (unless otherwise indicated), 5 mm MgCl2, and either 0.5 mm Ca2+ and lipid (sonicated dispersion of brain phosphatidylserine (140 μm) and diacylglycerol (3.8 μm), prepared as described (22Orr J.W. Keranen L.M. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15263-15266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) or 0.5 mmEGTA in a final volume of 80 μl. Samples were incubated at 30 °C for 4–6 min and quenched by the addition of 25 μl of a solution containing 0.1 m ATP and 0.1 m EDTA (pH 8–9). Aliquots (85 μl) were spotted on P81 ion-exchange chromatography paper and washed four times with 0.4% (v/v) phosphoric acid, followed by a 95% ethanol rinse, and 32P incorporation was detected by liquid scintillation counting in 5 ml of scintillation fluid (Biosafe II, Research Products International Corp.). Sucrose-loaded large unilamellar vesicles composed of 40 mol % 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylserine, 55 or 60 mol % 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine, and 0 or 5 mol % diacylglycerol and containing trace [3H]dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine were prepared by extrusion as described (23Mosior M. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25526-25533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Stock phospholipid concentrations were determined by phosphate analysis (24Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Concentrations of lipids recovered after extrusion were calculated from radioactivity. The interaction of protein kinase C with sucrose-loaded vesicles was measured as described by Rebecchi et al. (25Rebecchi M. Peterson A. McLaughlin S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12742-12747Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and adopted for protein kinase C (26Mosior M. Epand R.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 66-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Briefly, protein kinase C (15–20 μl of detergent-soluble supernatant containing wild-type or mutant protein kinase C) was incubated with vesicles (75 μm total lipid) in the presence of 100 nm to 1 mm Ca2+, in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.3 mg ml−1 bovine serum albumin, and 100 mm KCl for 5 min at 22 °C. Vesicle-bound enzyme was separated from free enzyme by centrifugation of the vesicle/enzyme mixture at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 25 °C. Aliquots from the supernatant and pellet of the binding experiment were assayed under identical conditions (1–2 μl of detergent-soluble supernatant per assay), and the vesicle-associated kinase activity was calculated as described (23Mosior M. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25526-25533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Protein kinase C's sensitivity to trypsin was determined by incubating the Sf21 cell supernatants containing 10–20 ng of wild-type or mutant protein kinase Cs in a total volume of 90 μl (containing 20 mm HEPES, 0.3 mmCa2+, with or without brain phosphatidylserine (250 μm) and diacylglycerol (7 μm)) in the presence of 0–20 units ml−1 trypsin, as indicated in the legend to Fig. 5. Proteolysis was carried out for 10 min at 30 °C and stopped by addition of 30 μl of SDS loading buffer. Samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (9% polyacrylamide) and followed by Western blot analysis using antibodies that recognize the catalytic domain of protein kinase C βII. Concentrations of free Ca2+ were calculated using a program provided by Dr. Claude Klee (27Klee C.B. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6645-6652Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) that takes into account pH, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+, EGTA, EDTA, and ATP concentrations. The dependence of protein kinase C's membrane binding on Ca2+ concentration was analyzed by a nonlinear least-squares fit to the Hill equation using the program Sigma Plot. The dependence of protein kinase C activity on ATP or substrate concentrations was analyzed by Michaelis-Menten kinetics using the program Sigma Plot. Apparent membrane association constraints were calculated by determining the ratio of bound protein kinase C:free protein kinase C divided by the total lipid concentration, as described (26Mosior M. Epand R.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 66-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Wild-type protein kinase C and the two carboxyl-terminal phosphorylation site mutants, S660A and S660E, were expressed in insect cells to characterize the effect of charge at position 660 on the biochemical properties of protein kinase C. The Western blot in Fig.1 shows that all three proteins were expressed at comparable levels in Sf21 cells; the antibody used labels phosphorylated and dephosphorylated protein kinase C equally (5Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Lysate of cells expressing wild-type protein kinase C (L) contained a major band migrating with an apparent molecular mass of 80 kDa (double asterisk), and a minor faster-migrating form with an apparent mass of 76 kDa (dash). The upper band partitioned in the detergent-soluble fraction and the lower band partitioned in the detergent-insoluble fraction. Mass spectrometric analysis previously established that the upper band is quantitatively phosphorylated at the two carboxyl-terminal phosphorylation sites, Thr-641 and Ser-660, and that the lower band is not phosphorylated at either of these positions (5Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) (an intermediate-migrating band, not labeled detectably in wild-type lysate in Fig. 1, contains phosphate at Thr-641 but not Ser-660). We have also shown previously (5Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) that phosphorylation at each carboxyl-terminal position results in a distinct electrophoretic shift. In contrast, phosphorylation of Thr-500, the first phosphorylation event, does not result in a change in protein kinase C's electrophoretic mobility; in addition, only about half of the mature protein kinase C (upper-migrating band) is phosphorylated at this position (5Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The S660A mutant and S660E mutant in cell lysates (L) resolved into two main bands. For the S660A mutant, the upper main band migrated with an apparent mass of 78 kDa (indicated by single asterisk in Fig. 1), just below that of the fully phosphorylated (80 kDa) wild-type enzyme. This is the position where protein phosphorylated at Thr-641 but not Ser-660 migrates (5Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), indicating that substitution of Ser-660 with Ala mimics the electrophoretic mobility of wild-type protein with no phosphate at position 660. The lowest S660A band comigrated with the lowest band for wild type (dash), again indicating the equivalence of dephosphorylated Ser and Ala at position 660 in affecting the mobility of protein kinase C. For the S660E mutant, the upper band comigrated with the upper band of wild-type protein kinase C (double asterisk), revealing that Glu mimics phosphate in inducing an electrophoretic mobility shift. Consistent with this, the lowest S660E band migrated with an intermediate mobility (single asterisk). Thus, negative charge at position 660 decreases the electrophoretic mobility of protein kinase C, with Glu or phosphate causing the same mobility change. Curiously, a faintly stained band above the mature protein kinase C was apparent in Western blots of S660A and S660E, suggesting the possibility of additional phosphorylation on a small fraction of the mutant protein kinase C population. The slower-migrating band for both mutants was preferentially, but not exclusively, localized in the detergent-soluble fraction (S). In particular, half of the slower-migrating (mature) band of S660A partitioned in the detergent-soluble fraction and half partitioned in the detergent-insoluble fraction (P). This contrasted with the slowest-migrating (mature) form of wild-type protein kinase C which partitioned almost exclusively in the detergent-soluble fraction. Thus, Ala at position 660 decreased the solubility of mature protein kinase C. As observed for wild-type enzyme, the faster migrating form of S660A, containing no phosphate at Thr-641, partitioned almost entirely in the detergent-insoluble fraction. A fraction of the mature S660E also partitioned in the detergent-insoluble fraction (P). However, in marked contrast to both wild-type enzyme and the S660A mutant, a significant fraction (65%) of the fastest migrating band of S660E partitioned in the detergent-soluble fraction. This indicates that protein with charge at Ser-660, but not Thr-641 (i.e. faster migrating S660E band), has an increased solubility compared with non-phosphorylated wild-type enzyme; conversely, protein with negative charge at Thr-641 but not Ser-660 (i.e. slower migrating S660A band), has a decreased solubility compared with fully phosphorylated wild-type enzyme. Lysis and fractionation in the absence of detergent revealed similar partitioning of the mature wild-type protein kinase C in the soluble fraction, revealing that it is localized in the cytosol (data not shown). Thus, negative charge at position 660 promotes the release of protein kinase C from the detergent-insoluble fraction into the cytosol. In the following experiments, the biochemical properties of wild-type and mutant protein kinase Cs recovered in the detergent-soluble fraction of cell lysates were characterized. Importantly, the wild-type protein kinase C in these extracts was quantitatively phosphorylated on Ser-660, as assessed by its migration as a single 80-kDa band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and as confirmed previously by mass spectrometry (5Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows that the baculovirus-expressed mutants displayed lipid-dependent activity when assayed under standard conditions (see “Materials and Methods”); however, the specific activity of the mutants was reduced relative to wild type. Under these assay conditions, S660A phosphorylated a synthetic peptide based on the myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) protein (protein kinase C-selective peptide (21Chakravarthy B.R. Bussey A. Whitfield J.F. Sikorska M. Williams R.E. Durkin J.P. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 196: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar)) at approximately 25% of the rate of wild-type enzyme, and S660E phosphorylated the peptide at approximately 61% of the rate of wild-type enzyme. To explore whether the reduced activity of the mutants arose because of decreased thermal stability, activity was examined as a function of incubation time in the presence or absence of lipid cofactors. Fig.3 A shows that wild-type protein kinase C (○) was relatively stable when incubated at 22 °C, losing only 20% of its activity after a 3-h incubation; no significant difference was observed in the presence or absence of lipid cofactors. In contrast, S660A (□) was thermally labile, losing half of its activity after a 20-min incubation in the presence of lipid (A) and 60 min in the absence of lipid (B). S660E (▵) displayed intermediate stability, losing half of its activity after approximately 90 min incubation in the presence of lipid (A); as with S660A, the rate of activity loss of S660E was approximately three times slower in the absence of lipid (B). This loss of activity did not result from proteolysis, as assessed by analysis on polyacrylamide gels, nor did it result from dephosphorylation: inclusion of microcystin in incubation mixtures had no effect on the loss of activity (data not shown). Thus, Ala at position 660 markedly decreased the thermal stability of protein kinase C, with Glu at that position partially protecting against destabilization. In addition, the active, lipid-bound conformation of protein kinase C was significantly more thermally labile than the inactive, unbound conformation. To address whether the 660 mutants were impaired catalytically, or whether the decreased activity observed in Fig. 2 arose because the enzyme was so labile, activity was measured under conditions promoting protein stability: in the presence of increasing concentrations of glycerol. Fig. 4 shows that the specific activity of both mutants approached that of wild-type as glycerol concentrations were raised. Specifically, inclusion of 20% glycerol in the reaction mixture increased the specific activity of S660A and S660E to 70 ± 10 and 90 ± 20%, respectively, of the wild-type specific"

The N-terminal domain includes a zinc finger motif and has been shown to bind Zn2+, whereas the central catalytic core domain includes a triad of acidic amino acids that bind Mn2+ or Mg2+, the metal cofactors required for enzymatic activity. The integration reaction occurs in two distinct steps; the first is a specific endonucleolytic cleavage step called “processing,” and the second is a polynucleotide transfer or “joining” step. Our previous results showed that the metal preference for in vitro activity of avian sarcoma virus IN is Mn2+ > Mg2+ and that a single cation of either metal is coordinated by two of the three critical active site residues (Asp-64 and Asp-121) in crystals of the isolated catalytic domain. Here, we report that Ca2+, Zn2+, and Cd2+ can also bind in the active site of the catalytic domain. Furthermore, two zinc and cadmium cations are bound at the active site, with all three residues of the active site triad (Asp-64, Asp-121, and Glu-157) contributing to their coordination. These results are consistent with a two-metal mechanism for catalysis by retroviral integrases. We also show that Zn2+ can serve as a cofactor for the endonucleolytic reactions catalyzed by either the full-length protein, a derivative lacking the N-terminal domain, or the isolated catalytic domain of avian sarcoma virus IN. However, polynucleotidyl transferase activities are severely impaired or undetectable in the presence of Zn2+. Thus, although the processing and joining steps of integrase employ a similar mechanism and the same active site triad, they can be clearly distinguished by their metal preferences.

The retroviral integrase (IN) 1The abbreviations used are: IN, integrase; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; ASV, avian sarcoma virus. 1The abbreviations used are: IN, integrase; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; ASV, avian sarcoma virus. is a virus-encoded enzyme that catalyzes integration of viral DNA into host DNA (1Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 133-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 2Goff S.P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 527-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 3Vink C. Groeneger O.A.M. Plasterk R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1419-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). As DNA integration is an essential step in the virus life cycle, IN is an important target for the design of drugs that block the replication of pathogenic retroviruses such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The integration reaction occurs in two distinct steps. First, IN nicks the viral DNA near the 3′-ends of both strands (the “processing” reaction); it then inserts these ends into host target DNA (the joining reaction). Both reactions comprise a nucleophilic attack by a hydroxyl oxygen on a phosphorous atom in the DNA backbone; the hydroxyl is derived from a water molecule in the processing reaction and from the newly formed 3′-OH at the end of the viral DNA in the joining reaction. Divalent cations Mn2+ or Mg2+ are known to be required as cofactors. In vitro the reactions are most efficient in the presence of Mn2+, but as Mg2+ is more abundant in living cells, it is generally presumed to be the physiologically relevant cation. Retroviral integrases contain approximately 300 amino acids and are composed of three domains (4Andrake M.D. Skalka A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19633-19636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The first two domains are highly conserved, and both include metal-binding sites. The N-terminal domain (amino acids ∼1–50) contains a zinc finger-like motif, HHCC. Binding of Zn2+ at this site stabilizes the structure of HIV-1 IN and enhances multimerization and activity (5Lee S.P. Xiao J. Knutson J.R. Lewis M.S. Han M.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 6Lee S.P. Han M.K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3837-3844Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 7Zheng R. Jenkins T.M. Craigie R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13639-13664Google Scholar). The central, catalytic domain (amino acids ∼50–200) is characterized by a triad of invariant acidic amino acids (Asp-64, Asp-121, and Glu-157 in ASV IN), the last two separated by 35 amino acids comprising the D,D(35)E motif. These three acidic residues are essential for both processing and joining activity and have been proposed to bind the divalent metal cofactors during catalysis (8Kulkosky J. Jones K.S. Katz R.A.

HIV-1 reverse transcriptase ribonuclease H (RNase H) domain, another member of this superfamily, was shown to bind two divalent cations in this site (13Davies J.F., II Hostomska Z. Hostomsky Z. Jordan S.R. Matthews D.A. Science. 1991; 252: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar), prompting the suggestion (14Yang W. Steitz T.A. Structure ( Lond. ). 1995; 3: 131-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) that all members of this family may use a two-metal catalytic mechanism like that deduced for the 3′-5′ exonuclease of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I (15Beese L.S. Steitz T.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar, 16Rice P. Craigie R. Davies D.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 78-83Crossref Scopus (180) Google Scholar). We have shown that side chains of two of the acidic triad residues in the D,D(35)E motif in ASV IN also form a metal binding pocket. A single ion, Mn2+ or Mg2+, is complexed to Asp-64 and Asp-121 when crystals of the isolated catalytic domain of ASV IN are soaked in metal-containing solutions (12Bujacz G. Jaskólski M. Alexandratos J. Wlodawer A. Merkel G. Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. Structure ( Lond. ). 1996; 4: 89-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that a second metal might be bound between the Asp-64 and Glu-157 in the full-length protein or in the presence of substrate. Here we show that additional divalent cations can also bind in the active site of crystals of the isolated catalytic core domain of ASV IN. Moreover, in the case of Zn2+ and Cd2+, two ions are complexed by side chains from all three of the acidic amino acids of the D,D(35)E motif. To investigate the significance of these observations, we measured enzymatic properties in the presence of these metals with the isolated catalytic core, full-length ASV IN protein and an N-terminal deletion derivative that lacks the zinc finger motif but retains both processing and joining activities. The results of the structural analysis are consistent with a two-metal reaction mechanism. The biochemical studies show that whereas Zn2+ is a cofactor for the hydrolytic, nicking activities, it provides little or no detectable support for the polynucleotidyltransferase activities of IN. Expression, purification, and crystallization of the catalytic core domain of ASV IN have been described previously (11Bujacz G. Jaskólski M. Alexandratos J. Wlodawer A. Merkel G. Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 333-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), and the crystals used here were grown by the same procedures. Salts of divalent cations used in this study were dissolved in the well buffer to produce the soaking solutions. The crystals were soaked for 2–3 days, as in the previous studies (12Bujacz G. Jaskólski M. Alexandratos J. Wlodawer A. Merkel G. Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. Structure ( Lond. ). 1996; 4: 89-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Some experiments were performed on crystals grown directly in the presence of divalent cations without finding any difference in their mode of binding (data not shown). Diffraction data were collected at room temperature on MAR300 or DIP2020 image plate detectors using graphite-monochromated CuKα radiation. They were processed with DENZO and scaled with SCALEPACK (17Otwinowski, Z. (1992) An Oscillation Data Processing Suite for Macromolecular Crystallography, Version 1.6.2, Yale University Press, New Haven, CT.Google Scholar). Data with F > 2ς(F) were used in refinement, and the low resolution cutoff was either 8 or 10 Å. Structure refinements were carried out using the program PROLSQ (18Hendrickson W.A. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 115: 252-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar), which was modified to utilize free R-factor computation. Some structures were refined with 8% of the separately and randomly chosen data reserved for that purpose, whereas other refinements did not utilize free R-factor (see Table I). Structures of the Mn2+ and Mg2+ complexes were refined very carefully until final convergence, whereas other structures were modeled carefully only in the vicinity of the metal-binding sites, with other areas subject to less careful rebuilding. This is reflected in somewhat higher R-factors for these structures, which are nevertheless adequate to impart confidence in the structural results described here. The coordinates of the complexes with Ca2+, Zn2+, and Cd2+ have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY (accession codes 1VSI, 1VSH, and 1VSJ, respectively). The coordinates of selected Mg2+and Mn2+ complexes were deposited previously (12Bujacz G. Jaskólski M. Alexandratos J. Wlodawer A. Merkel G. Katz R.A. Skalka A.M.

See text for the discussion of partial occupancies. The full-length ASV IN and the catalytic IN-(39–286) were purified as described previously (19Katz R.A. Merkel G. Skalka A.M. Virology. 1996; 217: 178-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Assays were carried out exactly as described (11Bujacz G. Jaskólski M. Alexandratos J. Wlodawer A. Merkel G. Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 333-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Briefly, for nicking and processing, the substrate was an 18-base pair duplex corresponding to the U3 end of ASV DNA. The 5′-end of the plus strand was labeled with 32P. The reaction mix contained 50 mm Tris, pH 8.4, 2 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 mm NaCl, and 4% glycerol. Reactions were carried out in substrate excess. For processing and joining, the concentration of IN was 2 μm, and the DNA substrate was 15 μm. For disintegration reactions, the concentration of IN was 1 μm, and the DNA substrate was 8 μm. The disintegration substrate was prepared by annealing four separate DNA strands of 19, 16, 10, and 9 nucleotides with the 10-nucleotide strand end-labeled with 32P. Reactions were carried out at the indicated times and metal concentrations. Reaction products were fractionated on 20% acrylamide-urea sequencing gels, and bands were quantified using a Fuji phosphoimager. Results are expressed as μmol of product/μmol of IN monomer or IN fragment. In our earlier studies, we soaked crystals of the isolated ASV IN catalytic domain with the two known divalent cation cofactors, Mn2+ and Mg2+(12Bujacz G. Jaskólski M. Alexandratos J. Wlodawer A. Merkel G. Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. Structure ( Lond. ). 1996; 4: 89-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). We observed coordination of both cations between Asp-64 and Asp-121 of the catalytic triad but no participation of its third member, Glu-157. To further investigate the possible participation of Glu-157 in metal binding, we carried out a systematic analysis encompassing a variety of divalent cations and a wider range of concentrations. Crystals of the catalytic domain of ASV IN-(52–207) were soaked in 2–500 mm solutions of five divalent cations: Mg2+, Mn2+, Zn2+, Ca2+, and Cd2+. Structures of the metal-soaked crystals were solved and refined at moderately high resolution (TableI). As reported earlier, the electron density map corresponding to the structure of the Mg2+ complex obtained at the highest concentration of its salt is exceptionally clear and shows a cation bound between the carboxylates of Asp-64 and Asp-121 of the D,D(35)E motif (denoted site I). However, no indication of binding of a second cation could be found in this map. Less than 30% occupancy was observed at a lower concentration of Mg2+ (20 mm), indicating that binding was much weaker. A putative metal/water cluster did not refine well. However, a similarly positioned, single metal ion was detected at full occupancy after soaking the crystals in an even lower (10 mm) concentration of MnCl2. No additional metal-binding sites were observed, even in 500 mm MnCl2 (Fig.1 A). A higher apparent affinity for Mn2+ is consistent with observations that ASV IN is approximately 30-fold more active in Mn2+ than Mg2+. Crystals soaked in 100 mm CaCl2 were also found to bind a divalent cation at site I, with interactions between the calcium ion and the active site residues similar to those observed with Mg2+ and Mn2+. With Ca2+, coordination is an incomplete octahedron in appearance, a square pyramid with the metal in the center of the square base and three water molecules in the coordination sphere. Unexpectedly, we found that Zn2+ binds in four separate sites on the surface of the isolated catalytic domain of ASV IN (Table I), with partial occupancy observed at a concentration as low as 2 mm and full occupancy of the sites at 100 mm. At the higher concentration of Zn2+, two of the ions bind in the catalytic center, one at site I between Asp-64 and Asp-121 and a second, denoted site II, coordinated by Asp-64 and Glu-157 (Fig.1 B). The distance between the zinc cations in the active site is 3.62 Å. Site III (not shown) is in a loop defined by amino acids 92–107, with the ion directly coordinated to His-103, coordinated to His-93 via a water molecule, and liganded with two other water molecules. The fourth zinc ion is bound in the vicinity of the C terminus of the catalytic domain and is coordinated by residues His-198 and Tyr-194 (site IV). Zinc ions bound at sites III and IV show clear tetrahedral coordination, whereas the cations in sites I and II are coordinated to two oxygens of the carboxylates and one water molecule each. One additional water molecule may complete a tetrahedral coordination of cations in the catalytic center by bridging both zinc ions. This putative water is not seen clearly in the electron density maps; it does, however, appear as a weak peak in 2F o −F 1a c maps. During the refinement process, the water molecule located in this position shifts from one edge of one Zn2+ electron density to the other, so it was placed in the final model with null occupancy just to indicate its putative placement. As this water molecule faces bulk solvent, it is not surprising that its position is not well defined. The other water molecules coordinating the zinc ions are found in very clear electron density. With the crystal soaked in 2 mm Zn2+, we observed a pattern of metal binding similar to that at 100 mm. In this case, both catalytic binding sites showed less than complete occupancies, with site II lower than site I. Temperature factors are correspondingly higher for site II than for site I. However, the structure with 100 mm Zn2+ had complete occupancy and relatively low temperature factors for both cations located in the active site. Two Cd2+ ions were visible in the catalytic center after soaking in 100 mm CdCl2 and were again coordinated to all three carboxylate residues of the essential triad (Fig. 1 C). However, there was lower occupancy of site II and higher temperature factor for this ion than for the ion in site I. This is similar to binding observed at the lowest concentration (2 mm) of Zn2+ and again suggests that the cations in site II may be bound less strongly than those occupying site I. The distance between the cadmium ions in the catalytic center is 4.06 Å (see Fig. 2). The Cd2+ in site I has an almost perfect octahedral coordination sphere, very similar to the coordination of Mn2+ and Mg2+. The Cd2+ in site II has deformed octahedral coordination, sharing a water ligand with the first cation. Singularly in this case, both Glu-157 carboxyl oxygens coordinate with this one cation. The most solvent-accessible water molecules liganded to each metal, bound opposite to the Asp-64 ligand, have slightly longer hydrogen bonding distances and higher temperature factors. The atomic coordinates of the three crucial carboxylic acids are only slightly affected when one or more cations are bound. There is practically no change in the position of the side chain of Asp-64 (mean shift of the atomic positions from their average values, calculated for all structures listed in Table I, is 0.125 Å), a very slight movement of the side chain of Asp-121 (0.187 Å), and a more pronounced difference in location of the side chain of Glu-157 (0.857-Å shift) (Fig. 2). The rotation of the side chain of Glu-157 results in approximately the same difference in carboxylate positions as seen in two different, uncomplexed forms of ASV IN crystallized from different precipitants, polyethylene glycol and ammonium sulfate (11Bujacz G. Jaskólski M. Alexandratos J. Wlodawer A. Merkel G. Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 333-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The minimal deviation in carboxylate positioning upon metal binding is consistent with the observation that even single conservative substitutions in these residues drastically reduced activity of both ASV and HIV-1 IN (8Kulkosky J. Jones K.S. Katz R.A. Mack J.P. Skalka A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2331-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). The Zn2+ structures show the only active sites that are fully occupied with two metal cations at 100 mm concentration (Table I). To determine which cations are preferred by the enzyme, we soaked ASV IN catalytic domain crystals in various concentrations of Zn2+ plus either Mg2+ or Mn2+salts. In the highest concentration (100 mm for each salt), both structures were essentially identical to the structure with 100 mm Zn2+ alone. However, a Zn2+, Mn2+ structure at 10 mm concentrations of each salt produced a mixed image. The water coordination around the metal occupying active site I appears as a superposition of both Zn2+ and Mn2+ structures. We interpreted these maps as a mixture of Zn2+ and Mn2+ in site I and only Zn2+ in site II. As summarized in Table I, the occupancy of zinc cations in sites I and II are refined to be equal. This result may indicate the existence of some cooperativity between the sites, such that if site II is occupied by Zn2+, then site I can no longer be occupied by Mn2+ or Mg2+. Having observed Ca2+, Zn2+, and Cd2+ occupancy of site I (or I and II) in the active site of the catalytic domain, we asked whether any of these cations could function as cofactors for enzymatic activity of IN. The isolated catalytic core domain of ASV IN displays two metal-dependent activities, a DNA endonuclease “nicking” activity, and a DNA cleavage-ligation “disintegration” activity (11Bujacz G. Jaskólski M. Alexandratos J. Wlodawer A. Merkel G. Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 333-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 20Kulkosky J. Katz R.A. Merkel G. Skalka A.M. Virology. 1995; 206: 448-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). DNA nicking by the ASV IN catalytic domain is quite efficient and similar in specific activity to that of the full-length protein. Therefore, we first assayed for this nicking activity, which is characterized by preferred cleavage between the C and A of the conserved CA dinucleotide near the viral DNA termini (Fig. 3 A, −3). This endonucleolytic activity is distinct from “−2” processing, and its biological relevance is not yet understood. The catalytic core domain was incubated with a short DNA duplex substrate that represents a viral DNA end in the presence of varying concentrations of ZnCl2, ZnSO4, CaCl2, and CdSO4 as well as the known metal cofactors, MgCl2 and MnCl2. Of the new metals tested, only Zn2+ supported significant activity (comparison not shown). As shown in Fig. 3 A, the Zn2+-dependent activity exhibits a sharp peak at approximately 2 mm ZnSO4; similar results were obtained with ZnCl2 (data not shown). At this peak, activity is approximately half of that observed with the same concentration of MnCl2. However, significantly less activity is observed at higher ZnSO4 concentrations. The optimum concentration of MnCl2 is approximately 10 mm, with little change in activity up to 25 mm. The decreased activity at ZnSO4 concentrations >2 mm is not due to the anion, as similar results were observed with the chloride and sulfate salts. We conclude that the ASV IN catalytic domain displays significant nicking activity with Zn2+, as a cofactor at a concentration in which site I is likely to be fully occupied and site II is likely to be at least partially occupied. Higher concentrations of Zn2+ are inhibitory. Although Mg2+ and Ca2+ could bind to site I and Cd2+ could bind to sites I and II in the crystal, no nicking activity could be detected in the presence of a broad range of concentrations of these metals (data not shown). We compared the time-dependent nicking activity of the catalytic domain in the presence of Zn2+, Mg2+, and Mn2+. The metal concentrations used were 2 mm ZnSO4, 10 mm MnCl2(the optimal concentrations determined above), and 5 mmMgCl2. As illustrated in Fig. 3 B, nicking activity is readily detected in the presence of ZnSO4, although the rate and extent of the reaction are approximately one-tenth that observed with Mn2+. However, no activity was detected with MgCl2. Thus, at least for the isolated catalytic core domain, we find no activity with the cation presumed to be important in vivo but significant activity with Zn2+ as a cofactor. The ASV catalytic domain was also assayed for disintegration activity (Fig. 3 C), which proceeds at 0.2% of the rate observed with the full-length protein. In the presence of 10 mmMnCl2, disintegration is clearly detectable with the catalytic domain, as described previously (20Kulkosky J. Katz R.A. Merkel G. Skalka A.M. Virology. 1995; 206: 448-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, no disintegration activity was observed with 2 mmZnSO4, even after prolonged exposure of the autoradiogram. We conclude that Zn2+ is unable to support significant disintegration activity of the isolated catalytic domain under these conditions. As noted above, using equimolar (10 mm) amounts of Zn2+ and Mn2+, we observed predominant occupancy of site I by Mn2+ and exclusive occupancy of site II by Zn2+. For comparative activity studies, incubations were carried out using a fixed but suboptimal concentration of Mn2+ (3 mm) in the presence of increasing concentrations of the divalent metals to be tested, and production of the −3 product was followed as in Fig. 3,A and B. We observed a slight increase in activity at low or equal concentrations of Mg2+ relative to Mn2+ (Fig. 4). As Mg2+ does not support nicking activity on its own, the significance of this increase is not yet clear. Ca2+ had no significant effect at the same concentrations, and there was only a slight decrease in activity at higher concentrations of Mg2+ or Ca2+. In contrast to results with Mg2+ and Ca2+, both ZnCl2 and ZnSO4 showed potent inhibition of Mn2+-dependent nicking activity (Fig. 4). At equal concentrations of Zn2+ and Mn2+, the reaction was inhibited approximately 75%. The residual activity observed at this concentration may reflect the Zn2+-dependent nicking. Although other interpretations are possible, these results are consistent with inhibition of the Mn2+-dependent activity in favor of the Zn2+-dependent activity. This potent inhibition by Zn2+ is also consistent with the apparent high affinity of the isolated catalytic domain for Zn2+ ions, as exemplified by high occupancy in the crystals even at relatively low metal concentrations. Cd2+, which can also bind to sites I and II but is not a cofactor for nicking by the isolated catalytic core domain, is even a more potent inhibitor than Zn2+; no significant activity was detected with this divalent cation at the higher concentrations (Fig. 4). If we assume that the inhibition reflects the abilities of these metals to bind to the catalytic center, these results suggest a relative affinity corresponding to Cd2+, Zn2+ > Mn2+> Ca2+, Mg2+ and is consistent with the results shown in Table I. We next asked if Zn2+or the other previously untested divalent metals could function as a cofactor for the processing and joining activities of full-length ASV IN. Our initial survey revealed no significant activity with full-length IN in a range of concentrations of Ca2+ or Cd2+ (data not shown). Zn2+ did support activity with an optimal concentration of 2 mm (not shown). We then compared the activities in the presence of 2 mmZnSO4 or 10 mm MgCl2 (the optimal concentration, data not shown). As illustrated in Fig.5 A, the full-length IN showed significant processing activity (−2 nicking) in the presence of Zn2+; this activity is slightly reduced compared with that observed with Mg2+, but both are approximately 10-fold lower than that observed with Mn2+ as the cofactor (not shown). Joining activity can be d"

To characterize these isoforms, calcium transport was determined in a microsomal fraction. Both rPMCA2a and rPMCA2b had a much higher affinity for calmodulin than the corresponding forms of hPMCA4, and rPMCA2b had the highest affinity among the isoforms that have been tested so far. When analyzed at a relatively high calmodulin concentration, rPMCA2b and, to a lesser extent, rPMCA2a showed higher apparent calcium affinity;i.e. they were more active at lower Ca2+concentrations than hPMCA4b. This indicates that these two variants of rat isoform 2 will tend to maintain a lower free cytosolic Ca2+ level in cells where they are expressed. Both variants also showed a higher level of basal activity (in the complete absence of calmodulin) than hPMCA4b, a property which would reinforce their ability to maintain a low free cytosolic Ca2+concentration. Experiments designed to determine the source of the higher apparent Ca2+ affinity of rPMCA2b showed that it came from the properties of the carboxyl terminus, rather than from any difference in the catalytic core.

The plasma membrane Ca2+ pump plays a key role in controlling the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. This P-type ATPase is regulated by calmodulin and is responsible for the ATP powered removal of Ca2+ from eukaryotic cells (1Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2115-2118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The plasma membrane Ca2+ pump (PMCA) 1The abbreviations used are: PMCA, plasma membrane Ca2+ pump; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s). 1The abbreviations used are: PMCA, plasma membrane Ca2+ pump; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s). has a low level of activity in the absence of calmodulin. Calmodulin binds to an autoinhibitory domain (the C domain), and increases both the maximum velocity of the pump and the apparent Ca2+ affinity. To date, at least four different genes have been found which encode for PMCA (2Penniston J.T. Enyedi A. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 1994; 4: 148-159Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Additional variability is obtained by alternate splices occurring at two sites in the pump (3Strehler E.E. J. Membr. Biol. 1991; 120: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 4Khan I.

Chem. 1993; 268: 25993-26003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are located in the middle of the cytosolic loop between transmembrane domains 2 and 3 (splice site A) (9Carafoli E. Guerini D. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1993; 3: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and downstream of the last transmembrane domain, in the middle of the calmodulin-binding domain (splice site C) (9Carafoli E. Guerini D. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1993; 3: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 10Keeton T.P. Burk S.E. Shull G.E. J. Biol.

A. 1989; 86: 6908-6912Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The first 18 amino acids of the calmodulin-binding domain are conserved for all PMCA isoforms, but the presence of the alternative RNA splice site in the middle of this region (at splice site C) changes the remainder of the calmodulin-binding domain as well as the carboxyl terminus (10Keeton T.P. Burk S.E. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2740-2748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The isoforms whose mRNA contains a spliced-in exon are called “a,” while those isoforms lacking the additional exon are called “b.” 2The plasma membrane calcium pump is referred to by a name such as hPMCA4b, where h indicates the species, in this case human, PMCA indicates the plasma membrane calcium pump, 4 refers to the product of the fourth gene, and b indicates which alternate splice was used. A recently proposed system (22Carafoli E.

For this paper, we will not be using this proposed system. 2The plasma membrane calcium pump is referred to by a name such as hPMCA4b, where h indicates the species, in this case human, PMCA indicates the plasma membrane calcium pump, 4 refers to the product of the fourth gene, and b indicates which alternate splice was used.

For this paper, we will not be using this proposed system. The a variants of the isoforms have a less basic calmodulin-binding domain as well as a different carboxyl terminus than the b variants. When synthetic peptides corresponding to representative a and b forms of the calmodulin-binding domain were compared, the b form of the peptide showed a 10-fold higher affinity for calmodulin than the a form of the peptide (12Enyedi A. Filoteo A.G. Gardos G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8952-8956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, full-length isoforms hPMCA4a and hPMCA4b were overexpressed in COS-1 cells and the calmodulin-response curves were analyzed. As expected, the hPMCA4b isoform had a higher affinity for calmodulin than the hPMCA4a isoform (13Enyedi A. Verma A.K. Heim R. Adamo H.P. Filoteo A.G. Strehler E.E. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 41-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we have compared isoforms 2a and 2b of the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump of the rat with the most widely studied isoform to date, isoform 4b from human tissues. The exact isoforms utilized were rPMCA2az and rPMCA2bz. In this nomenclature, the last letter (z in this case) refers to a splice at site A which changes only a small region of the enzyme because it does not involve a frameshift (5Adamo H.P. Penniston J.T. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 355-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We did not compare different alternatively spliced products in this region, and so we will not discuss its properties further. In the remainder of this paper we will omit the z since both enzymes studied were of this form. We utilized the rat message instead of human partly because the DNAs were more easily available, but also because we anticipate that many future studies in different laboratories will be carried out with rat tissues. Therefore, utilizing the rat enzymes will allow the development of antibodies and other reagents which will contribute to a coordinated attack on discovering the properties of the different isoforms of the pump in rat. In the case of the present study, the rat enzymes are a good substitute for the human ones since their amino acid sequences are nearly the same. rPMCA2a and hPMCA2a are 97.9% identical when aligned, and rPMCA2b and hPMCA2b are 98.1% identical. Thus, almost all of the differences in properties can be attributed to the differences in the two genes which are being compared, rather than to the differences in species. This is evident when one observes that rPMCA2a is only 75.7% identical with hPMCA4b and that rPMCA2b is 75.4% identical with hPMCA4b. Because of these relationships, we will generally not mention the species differences in our discussion, but will focus on the different gene products and the alternative splice in the downstream region. Because rPMCA2a and rPMCA2b come from a different gene than hPMCA4, some of the differences between 2 and 4 are scattered throughout the molecule. However, large stretches of the molecule are very highly conserved and the biggest sequence differences are concentrated in three regions: the amino terminus, the carboxyl terminus, and a region near the upstream alternative splice. A recent paper (14Hilfiker H. Guerini D. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26178-26183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) described the expression of hPMCA2b in insect cells and the effect of an alternate splice at site A. Although the authors found substantial differences between gene products 2 and 4 they did not find any difference in the characteristics of the isoforms of hPMCA2 produced by this alternate splice. In the present paper, we report the overexpression of full-length rPMCA2b and rPMCA2a isoforms from rat in COS-7 cells. rPMCA2a is produced by an alternate splice at site C which changes the calmodulin-binding domain and the rest of the carboxyl terminus of rPMCA2 and is expected to have specific regulatory characteristics. Unlike the case for the alterations at site A, we find substantial differences in properties caused by the alternate splice at site C. This report will focus on the functional properties of these two isoforms and how they compare with the most widely studied isoform to date, isoform 4b from human. 45CaCl2 was purchased from NEN Life Sciences Products. LipofectAMINE, Opti-MEM, and restriction enzymes were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Calmodulin was purchased from Sigma. All other chemicals used for this study were of reagent grade. The full-length rPMCA2b isoform in the pBR322 vector was a gift from Dr. G. Shull (University of Cincinnati). The full-length rPMCA2b gene was excised from the pBR322 vector with ApaI and ligated into the Bluescript SK+ vector (Stratagene) at the ApaI site. The full-length DNA was excised from Bluescript SK+vector with SalI and KpnI, cloned into the expression vector pMM2 and sequenced using the Applied Biosystems Automatic Sequencer. A male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rat was given a lethal injection of sodium pentobarbital, then decapitated. The entire brain was rapidly dissected out and immediately placed in liquid nitrogen, where it was kept until use. The isolation of mRNA from the brain was performed using the FastTrack mRNA isolation kit (Invitrogen), following the standard protocol. Reverse transcription was performed using the GeneAmp RNA PCR kit (Perkin-Elmer). Random hexamers were used as the reverse transcriptase primers, with the mRNA isolated from rat brain being used as the template. The incubation times and temperatures for the reverse transcription were 10 min at room temperature, 45 min at 42 °C, 5 min at 99 °C, and 5 min at 4 °C. PCR amplification was done to produce the carboxyl terminus of the rPMCA2a isoform, using the GeneAmp RNA PCR kit (Perkin-Elmer), a total volume of 100 μl was used. The reaction (in a Perkin-Elmer 9600 thermal cycler) was initiated with a 2-min melting step at 94 °C, followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 52 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min, with a final 7-min extension step at 72 °C. The 5′ forward PCR primer was CCTGAATCGGATCCAGACACAG, which contained a BamHI cut site. The 3′ reverse PCR primer was CGACGCGGTACCCTTTAAATTTCACTC, which contained a KpnI cut site. The expected PCR product was 242 bp. After amplification, 15 μl of each of the PCR samples were size fractionated by electrophoresis in a 1.5% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. A 123-bp DNA ladder (Life Technologies, Inc.) was run along with the PCR samples. We used the entire rPMCA2b cDNA up to the calmodulin-binding domain at which point the 2b sequence was replaced by a PCR product fragment which provided the a form of rPMCA2. RPMCA2b was digested with XhoI and run in a 1% agarose gel. The desired 752-bp DNA fragment (which included the calmodulin-binding domain) was excised from the gel, purified with GeneClean (BIO 101, Inc.) and cloned into the pSP72 vector (Promega) at the XhoI site. Both the 752-bp fragment in the pSP72 vector and the 242-bp PCR fragment were digested with BamHI andKpnI and run in a 1% agarose gel. The 2.9-kilobase band from the digested 752-bp fragment in the pSP72 vector and the ∼226-bp digested PCR product were excised from the gel, cleaned using the GeneClean and Mermaid kits (BIO 101, Inc.), respectively, and ligated together using standard protocol. This ligation formed the rPMCA2a carboxyl terminus which included the new calmodulin-binding domain. The rPMCA2a carboxyl terminus in pSP72 and the full-length rPMCA2b in the pMM2 vector were each digested with XhoI andKpnI. The desired bands (the rPMCA2b minus the calmodulin-binding domain in the pMM2 vector and the rPMCA2a carboxyl terminus from pSP72) were ligated together and sequenced. Transfection was carried out using Lipofectamine (Life Technologies, Inc.). 150-cm2 flasks were seeded with 25 × 105 COS cells. Transfection was initiated when the cells were 70–80% confluent. DNA-LipofectAMINE complex for each flask was prepared by incubating 8 μg of DNA and 100 μl of LipofectAMINE in 3.6 ml of serum-free Opti-MEM for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were incubated with the DNA-LipofectAMINE complex in 14.5 ml of serum-free Opti-MEM for 5 h at 37 °C, then supplemented with serum and the incubation continued for a total of 24 h. The DNA-LipofectAMINE-containing medium was then replaced with fresh tissue culture medium with 10% serum and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for an additional 24 h. Crude microsomal membranes were prepared as described by Verma et al.(15Verma A.K. Enyedi A. Filoteo A.G. Strehler E.E. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3714-3718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Ca2+ uptake by microsomal vesicles was measured for 5 min at 37 °C by filtration through Millipore membrane filters (0.45 μm, HA) as described previously (16Enyedi A. Verma A.K. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10621-10626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The desired free Ca2+ concentrations were obtained by varying the concentration of EGTA. The microsomes were preincubated at 37 °C for 3 min in the appropriate concentration of calmodulin before Ca2+ uptake was initiated by the addition of ATP (6 mm). The Ca2+ uptake by control membrane vesicles isolated from pMM2-transfected cells was subtracted from each data point. 1 μg of microsomal membrane proteins was dissolved in electrophoresis sample buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 125 mg/ml urea, and 100 mmdithiothreitol. The samples were then loaded on a 7.5% acrylamide gel following Laemmli's procedure (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). The samples were blotted after electrophoresis to polyvinylidine difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) using 25 mm Tris, 0.7 m glycine as a transfer solution. The blots were immunostained with 5F10 monoclonal anti-Ca2+ pump antibody (18Caride A.J. Filoteo A.G. Enyedi A. Verma A.K. Penniston J.T. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) or with a monoclonal anti-calmodulin mixture (Sigma) of three antibodies as needed. To study the ATP-dependent Ca2+ transport activity of rPMCA2a and rPMCA2b isoforms, the full-length clones were overexpressed in COS cells. These isoforms are identical up to residue 1095, but downstream of this residue the alternative splice in the calmodulin-binding domain changes the carboxyl terminus for each isoform. The carboxyl terminus of rPMCA2a is shorter, so that the protein produced has 1154 amino acids, while the rPMCA2b protein has 1198 amino acids (10Keeton T.P. Burk S.E. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2740-2748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Crude membranes from COS cells transfected with cDNA encoding hPMCA4a, hPMCA4b, rPMCA2a, and rPMCA2b were prepared, solubilized, and their protein (1 μg) separated by a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Fig. 1 shows a Western blot using the monoclonal antibody 5F10 to visualize rPMCA2a, rPMCA2b, hPMCA4a, and hPMCA4b. The estimated molecular weight for isoforms rPMCA2a and rPMCA2b corresponded to the expected molecular mass for each isoform based on their protein sequences. The level of expression was nearly the same for all four isoforms. Microsomal membranes isolated from rPMCA2a, rPMCA2b, and hPMCA4b transfected cells were assayed in the presence of thapsigargin and oligomycin to inhibit the activity of the endogenous endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump and the mitochondrial ATPase as described (16Enyedi A. Verma A.K. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10621-10626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Table I shows the activity of Ca2+ uptake by the microsomal membranes from rPMCA2a, rPMCA2b, and hPMCA4b transfected COS cells in the absence and presence of calmodulin (540 nm). Both rPMCA2a and rPMCA2b had higher basal activity than hPMCA4b when tested in the absence of calmodulin. The activity when measured at saturating calmodulin and Ca2+ concentrations was nearly the same, with only small variations due to variations in the expression level.Table IComparison of Ca 2+ uptake activities of microsomes isolated from rPMCA2a, rPMCA2b, and hPMCA4b transfected COS cellsType of transfectionCa2+ transport−Calmodulin+Calmodulinnmol, mg membrane protein −1, min −1rPMCA2a3.67 ± 0.837.83 ± 1.78rPMCA2b4.21 ± 1.525.87 ± 2.18hPMCA4b1.45 ± 0.516.15 ± 0.71Ca2+ uptake by microsomal membranes was measured at 37 °C for 5 min in the presence or absence of 540 nm calmodulin.

The calmodulin dependence of each isoform was observed by measuring its Ca2+ transport activities at a fixed Ca2+concentration as a function of calmodulin concentration. The calmodulin response curves of the isoforms are compared in Fig. 2. RPMCA2b showed the highest sensitivity to calmodulin; this isoform was over four times more sensitive to calmodulin than hPMCA4b. These results were consistent with those of Hilfiker et al.

Chem. 1994; 269: 26178-26183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) when they studied these pumps expressed in insect cells and measured the Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity. Our study also included the calmodulin response curve of isoform rPMCA2a. Although rPMCA2a had somewhat lower affinity for calmodulin than rPMCA2b, it still showed much higher affinity than the corresponding 4 isoform, hPMCA4a (see Enyedi et al. (13Enyedi A. Verma A.K. Heim R. Adamo H.P. Filoteo A.G. Strehler E.E. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 41-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). A crucial element in the behavior of the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump is the affinity it has for calcium. Consequently, to study the characteristics of the isoforms, the Ca2+transport activities were tested by analyzing the dependence of Ca2+ uptake on free Ca2+ in the presence or in the absence of calmodulin. In Fig. 3, the Ca2+ transport activities of rPMCA2a and rPMCA2b at 540 nm calmodulin are compared with those of hPMCA4b. Although 540 nm calmodulin gave nearly full activation at saturating Ca2+ for each isoform, the apparent Ca2+affinities of the isoforms were different. RPMCA2b, and to a lesser extent rPMCA2a, were more responsive to Ca2+ stimulation than hPMCA4b (Fig. 3). Both rPMCA2a and rPMCA2b showed higher activities at lower Ca2+ concentrations. To determine whether the higher apparent Ca2+ affinity of rPMCA2b came from a difference in the catalytic core of the enzyme, we investigated whether the Ca2+ responsiveness of hPMCA4b could be brought up to the level displayed by rPMCA2b. We did this by comparing ct120, a constitutively activated form of hPMCA4b, with rPMCA2b. Ct120 is made from hPMCA4b by removal of the regulatory carboxyl terminus, and is fully activated without calmodulin (16Enyedi A. Verma A.K. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10621-10626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig.4 A compares the Ca2+ responses of rPMCA2b and hPMCA4b, in the presence of enough calmodulin to saturate at high Ca2+, with that of ct120, for which calmodulin was not added. This figure shows that the Ca2+ response of rPMCA2b is essentially identical to that of ct120. Fig. 4 Bshows that the level of calmodulin (540 nm) used in Fig.4 A is enough to give full activation of rPMCA2b, even at the lowest free Ca2+ concentration used (61 nm). Additionally, each isoform's characteristics were compared by measuring the dependence of Ca2+ uptake on free Ca2+ in the absence of calmodulin. The activities measured in the absence of calmodulin (Fig. 5 A) are graphed as a percentage of the maximum activity for each isoform that was determined in the presence of saturating calmodulin and Ca2+. When measured in the absence of calmodulin both rPMCA2a and rPMCA2b were 3–4 times more responsive to Ca2+stimulation than hPMCA4b. In addition, in the absence of calmodulin, the V max for rPMCA2b was much higher than for rPMCA2a or hPMCA4b. It was 71% of the maximum activity whereas in the case of rPMCA2a and hPMCA4b it was 46 and 23%, respectively. Table I also shows that the basal activity of rPMCA2b was the highest among the isoforms. In the presence of calmodulin hPMCA4b had a maximum velocity over four times above its basal level, while rPMCA2a and rPMCA2b had maximum velocities only 2 and 1.4 times, respectively, over the basal level (Fig. 5, Table I). Hilfiker et al. (14Hilfiker H. Guerini D. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26178-26183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also had similar results with the human PMCA2 isoform, which they discussed in connection with the possibility of incomplete removal of the endogenous calmodulin. To address this concern, we did additional experiments to determine whether the endogenous calmodulin was removed during the preparation of the microsomal membranes. In Fig. 5 B, the dependence of Ca2+ uptake on free Ca2+ by rPMCA2b in the absence of calmodulin was measured again. This time the membrane was preincubated with or without EGTA for 10 min at 37 °C prior to the start of the Ca2+ uptake assay without calmodulin. The slight decrease in the activity of rPMCA2b indicates that only a small amount of calmodulin was removed by the EGTA treatment. The second experiment addressing the high basal level of rPMCA2b was done using synthetic peptide C28R2. This synthetic peptide corresponds to the 28 residues that make up the calmodulin-binding domain in isoform rPMCA2b, and binds calmodulin very tightly, with a K d of about 0.1 nm (12Enyedi A. Filoteo A.G. Gardos G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8952-8956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 6 shows that the addition of up to 3 μm C28R2 at 10 μmCa2+ did not inhibit the Ca2+ uptake of rPMCA2b in the absence of calmodulin. As a positive control, the inhibition of rPMCA2b by C28R2 was also tested when the enzyme was activated by exogenous calmodulin. As Fig. 6 shows, C28R2 inhibited the calmodulin-activated portion of the activity easily. These results indicated that the Ca2+ dependent activity measured was not due to the presence of endogenous calmodulin. The final experiment of this set involved the use of an anti-calmodulin antibody to test for the presence of calmodulin in the microsomal membrane. Equal amounts of hPMCA4b and rPMCA2b microsomal fractions were immunoblotted and stained with an anti-calmodulin antibody following SDS-gel electrophoresis. No calmodulin was detected in either sample (results not shown). Unfortunately, the significance of this result was limited by the insensitivity of the anti-calmodulin antibody. The results obtained in the experiments using EGTA incubation, C28R2, and the anti-calmodulin antibody indicated that we had been successful in removing endogenous calmodulin and that the high basal level in rPMCA2b is an intrinsic property of the enzyme. This paper analyzed the characteristics of isoforms rPMCA2b and rPMCA2a and compared them to those of the more widely studied form, hPMCA4b. A recent study (14Hilfiker H. Guerini D. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26178-26183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has expressed, in insect cells, hPMCA2b (which they called PMCAIIA) and variants of gene 2 at splice site A and studied their Ca2+-ATPase activity. When they compared hPMCA2b to hPMCA4b, they found hPMCA2b had a much higher affinity for calmodulin. The work reported here expressed rPMCA2b and also another splicing variant of gene 2, rPMCA2a, in COS cells and showed active Ca2+ transport activity. The two isoforms, 2b and 2a, differ only in their carboxyl terminus. They are produced by an alternate splice which changes the structure of the carboxyl terminus starting from the middle of the calmodulin-binding domain. As a result of a similar alternate splice, the affinities of hPMCA4a and 4b for calmodulin were very different; hPMCA4b had a much higher affinity for calmodulin than hPMCA4a (13Enyedi A. Verma A.K. Heim R. Adamo H.P. Filoteo A.G. Strehler E.E. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 41-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our data measuring active Ca2+ transport (Fig. 2) agreed with that of Hilfikeret al. (14Hilfiker H. Guerini D. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26178-26183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), that isoform 2b had higher affinity for calmodulin than hPMCA4b. An additional finding of this paper was that, although rPMCA2a showed a lower affinity for calmodulin than rPMCA2b, its affinity was still much higher than that of hPMCA4a (see Enyediet al. (13Enyedi A. Verma A.K. Heim R. Adamo H.P. Filoteo A.G. Strehler E.E. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 41-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for comparison). Since the calmodulin-binding domains of isoforms 2 and 4 are not very different from one another, it seemed probable that the difference in the calmodulin affinity of these isoforms originates in another region of rPMCA2. We observed that the apparent Ca2+ affinity of the 3 isoforms decreased in the order rPMCA2b, rPMCA2a, and hPMCA4b, when tested at a relatively high concentration of calmodulin. The higher apparent Ca2+ affinity of rPMCA2b could be due to a difference in the regulatory carboxyl terminus, or to a difference in affinity of the catalytic core of the molecule for Ca2+. We tested for a difference in the catalytic core by comparing the Ca2+ response curve of ct120 (the truncated mutant of hPMCA4b lacking the regulatory carboxyl terminus) with the Ca2+ response curve of rPMCA2b which had been saturated with calmodulin. The result, shown in Fig. 4 A, showed that the catalytic core of hPMCA4b was capable of a Ca2+affinity just as high as that of rPMCA2b. This indicated that the difference in the Ca2+ affinity comes from the difference in the carboxyl terminus of these isoforms. Hilfiker et al.(14Hilfiker H. Guerini D. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26178-26183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were not able to detect any difference between the Ca2+ stimulation of rPMCA2b and hPMCA4b in the presence of calmodulin, perhaps because of the different expression and assay system they used. Also, this difference in the activity is seen only at low Ca2+ concentrations and could be overlooked. In the absence of calmodulin, rPMCA2b showed much higher activity than hPMCA4b at each Ca2+ concentration. These results agreed with Hilfiker et al. (14Hilfiker H. Guerini D. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26178-26183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who discussed the higher activity of rPMCA2b in the context of the tight binding of calmodulin to the enzyme. Using several methods, our results indicated that no calmodulin remained bound to the membranes containing rPMCA2b. Recent experiments indicated that in addition to the calmodulin-binding domain, hPMCA4b has a downstream inhibitory region which is responsible for the very low activity of this isoform in the absence of calmodulin (19Verma A.K. Enyedi A. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1687-1691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Enyedi A. Verma A.K. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32461-32467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Since this region, between residues 1113 and 1134 of hPMCA4b, is quite different from the corresponding region of rPMCA2b, it is possible that, unlike hPMCA4b, rPMCA2b does not have an extra downstream inhibitory region. RPMCA2a also showed higher activity in the absence of calmodulin than hPMCA4b; it resembled hPMCA4a in this respect (compare Fig.5 A with Fig. 5 from Verma et al. (15Verma A.K. Enyedi A. Filoteo A.G. Strehler E.E. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3714-3718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar)). Recent experiments (15Verma A.K. Enyedi A. Filoteo A.G. Strehler E.E. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3714-3718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) have shown that hPMCA4a has a much longer calmodulin-binding domain than hPMCA4b and that the whole inhibitory region (which appears to be less effective in self-inhibition than the one in hPMCA4b) is included within this domain. The structure of the regulatory region of the rPMCA2 isoforms remains to be determined but the data on rPMCA2a indicate that the inhibitory regions of rPMCA2a and hPMCA4a might be similar. Tissue distribution of the PMCA isoforms in human and rat has been examined by S1 nuclease protection, polymerase chain reaction, in situ hybridization, and at the protein level by Western blot analysis (8Stauffer T.P. Hilfiker H. Carafoli E. Strehler E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25993-26003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Keeton T.P. Burk S.E. Shull G.E. J. Biol.

Brain Res. 1992; 16: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These studies have shown that PMCA1 and 4 are broadly distributed, leading to the suggestion that they represent the “housekeeping” isoforms. On the other hand, PMCA2 and 3 were only detected in specialized tissues and cells: RPMCA2b mRNA has been localized to brain, heart, liver, skeletal muscle, spleen, and testes whereas rPMCA2a is found only in brain and heart. The data presented in this paper suggest that rPMCA2b will have very different properties from hPMCA4b under physiological conditions. Intracellular calmodulin concentrations are usually very high (2–5 μm in most cells, in brain about 50 μm); Figs. 3 and 4 Bshow that rPMCA2b remains activated by moderate levels of calmodulin even below 0.1 μm intracellular Ca2+concentration. This indicates that rPMCA2b is a form of the PMCA pump which is extremely effective in removing Ca2+ from the cytosol, a property which may make an important contribution to the physiology of cells where it is expressed."

BoChen L. Cell. 1988; 54: 37-46Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The ER is also known as the major Ca2+ storage compartment in eukaryotic cells. By pumping cytosolic Ca2+ into the ER lumen, cells keep their cytosolic concentration of free Ca2+ at extremely low levels so that they can use Ca2+ as intracellular signal (2Koch G.L.E. BioEssays. 1990; 12: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Besides, the ER itself needs luminal Ca2+ for its normal functions such as protein folding and protein sorting (3Booth C.

In addition, two Ca2+-binding ER-resident proteins, reticulocalbin (16Ozawa M. Muramatsu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 699-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Erc-55 (17Weis K. Griffiths G. Lamond A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19142-19150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), have been isolated recently. They have multiple EF-hand motifs and constitute a new subset of the EF-hand superfamily, together with a homologous protein in the lumen of the Golgi apparatus, Cab45 (18Scherer P.E. Lederkremer G.Z. Williams S. Fogliano M. Baldini G. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 257-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, their physiological functions are still unknown. ER-resident proteins generally carry a retention signal at their carboxyl terminus. This ER retention signal is first identified to be tetrapeptides, Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu (KDEL) in mammalian cells and His-Asp-Glu-Leu (HDEL) in yeast (19Pelham H.R.B. Hardwick K.G. Lewis M.J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1757-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 20Munro S. Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1987; 48: 899-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1553) Google Scholar). Soluble ER-resident proteins are trapped by binding to the KDEL receptor expressed in the cis-Golgi and retrieved to the ER (21Semenza J.C. Pelham H.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 22Tang B.L. Wong S.H. Qi X.L. Low S.H. Hong W. J. Cell.

Further studies have demonstrated that HDEL and several variants of the KDEL sequence can also work as the ER retention signal in mammalian cells (24Andres D.A. Dickerson I.M. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5952-5955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Andres D.A. Rhodes J.D. Meisel R.L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14277-14282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Comparison of variants of the KDEL sequence suggests that the replacement of Lys and Asp residues with other amino acid residues does not abolish the ER retention activity. However, the carboxyl-terminal two residues are considered to be critical because the third and fourth positions in all of the ER retention signals are Glu/Asp and Leu/Ile, respectively. During the embryogenesis, the heart begins to beat already in the 8.5-day mouse embryo, whose heart is still a two-chambered tube with one atrium and one ventricle (26Kaufman M.H. The Atlas of Mouse Development. Academic Press Ltd., London1992: 47-58Google Scholar). Beating of cardiac myocytes is maintained by the strict regulation of their cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration. To achieve this regulation, cardiac myocytes develop their specialized ER, called the sarcoplasmic reticulum, as the Ca2+ storage compartment and produce the rhythmical Ca2+ oscillation between the sarcoplasmic reticulum and the cytosol (27Chiesi M. Ho M.M. Inesi G. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. J. Cell. Biol. 1981; 91: 728-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Molecules involved in this Ca2+ oscillation are reported to be present very early in mouse cardiogenesis (28Moorman A.F.M. Vermeulen J.L.M. Koban M.U. Schwartz K. Lamers W.J. Boheler K.R. Circ.

Tada H. Heilker R. Shirozu M. Nakano T. Honjo T. Science. 1993; 261: 600-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 31Jacobs, K. (July 16, 1996) U.S. Patent 5,536,637.Google Scholar) of mouse embryonic heart to isolate cDNAs encoding amino-terminal hydrophobic signal sequences. We here report cloning and characterization of cDNA encoding calumenin that binds Ca2+ and carries a new ER retention signal, HDEF, at the carboxyl terminus. Calumenin is a novel member of the reticulocalbin family, a new subset of the EF-hand superfamily in the ER. Calumenin is most strongly expressed in the heart of adult and 18.5-day embryos. Poly(A) RNA from approximately 100 hearts of 9.5-day postcoitus (dpc) mouse embryos was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) and Oligotex™-dT30<Super> (Roche). cDNA was synthesized from 1.35 μg of poly(A) RNA using Super Script II (Life Technologies, Inc.). First strand cDNA was synthesized with 25 pmol of URPX3 primer: GAG-ACG-GTA-ATA-CGA-TCG-ACA-GTA-GCT-CGA-GXX-XXX-XXX-X (whereX represents one of the following: A, G, C, or T). After alkali lysis of RNA and the poly(A) tailing procedure, second strand cDNA was synthesized with 25 pmol of ESTN primer: CCG-CGA-ATT-CTG-ACT-AAC-TGA-(T)17 XX. Then cDNA of 400–800 base pairs were fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis and subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using ExTaq (TaKaRa, Japan) and 25 pmol of ESP primer (CCG-CGA-ATT-CTG-ACT-AAC-TGA-TT) and Ad-P1 primer (GAC-GGT-AAT-ACG-ATC-GAC-AGT-AGG) under the following conditions for Thermal-Cycler (TaKaRa, Japan): 94 °C for 5 min and then 94 °C for 45 s, 52 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 2 min for 25 cycles and 72 °C for 10 min. After cloning cDNA unidirectionally between the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pSuc2t7F1ori vector, screening procedures were performed as described (31Jacobs, K. (July 16, 1996) U.S. Patent 5,536,637.Google Scholar). To clone full-length cDNA, the 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) method was performed with LAtaq (TaKaRa). Mouse 13.5-dpc embryonic heart cDNA library in Uni-ZAP XR vector was used (Stratagene). C39N1b outer primer (biotinylated) (GTG-GAG-CTC-CCG-GGA-AAG-GTT-ATC-ATG) and C39N2 inner primer (CAT-GGA-CCT-GCG-TCA-GTT-TC) were designed as gene-specific primers and used with standard T7 primer (CGC-GTA-ATA-CGA-CTC-ACT-ATA-GGG-C). Conditions adopted for Perkin-Elmer 9600 were as follows: 95 °C for 2 min and then 95 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min for 25 cycles. The reaction mixture of first PCR with C39N1b and T7 primers was subjected to purification with M280 Dynabeads (Dynal) to decrease backgrounds due to nonspecific amplification by T7 primer. Second PCR was performed with C39N2 and T7 primers using the purified mixture. For sequencing, amplified cDNA was cloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega). Sequencing was performed with an automated sequencer (model 373A; Applied Biosystems), and sequence analysis was done with the computer analysis program, GeneWorks (IntelliGenetics, Inc.). Homology search was performed with BLAST and FASTA, using GenBank™ and EMBL as DNA data bases and PRF, PIR, and SwissProt as protein data bases. Motif search and localization analysis were performed on line at Prosite. To express proteins in mammalian cells, cDNAs were cloned in XbaI site of pEF-BOS expression vector (32Mizushima S. Nagata S.

FLAG epitope (8 amino acids; DYKDDDDK) was incorporated 5 amino acids downstream of the putative signal sequence cleavage site. The following primers were used for PCR: FLAG-calumenin primer, AAG-CCT-ACT-AGT-ATG-GAC-CTG-CGT-CAG-TTT-CTT-ATG-TGC-CTG-TCC-CTG-TGC-ACA-GCC-TTT-GCT-TTG-AGC-AAG-CCT-ACA-GAA-GAC-TAC-AAG-GAC-GAC-GAT-GAC-AAG-AAG-AAG-GAC-CGA-GTA-CAC-CAT-GAG-C; calumenin-HDEF primer, AAG-CCT-ACT-AGT-TCA-GAA-CTC-ATC-ATG-TCG-TAC-TAA-GG; calumenin-ΔHDEF primer, AAG-CCT-ACT-AGT-TCA-TCG-TAC-TAA-GGC-CTC-CCC; and calumenin-rHDEL primer, AAG-CCT-ACT-AGT-TCA-CAA-CTC-ATC-ATG-TCG-TAC-TAA-GG. Proteins were purified from transfected cells according to the standard protocol for immunoprecipitation, using lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) and the anti-FLAG affinity gel (Eastman Kodak Co.). Mouse anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Kodak), rabbit anti-protein-disulfide isomerase antibody (Stress Gen Biotechnologies), fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated affinity-purified goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) (absorbed with human and rabbit serum) (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories Inc.), and rhodamine-conjugated affinity-purified goat anti-rabbit IgG (minimal cross-reaction to mouse IgG) (Biosource International) were used. The procedures used to stain cells were essentially as described (18Scherer P.E. Lederkremer G.Z. Williams S. Fogliano M. Baldini G. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 257-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 33Amara J.F. Lederkremer G. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3315-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Stained cells were analyzed with a confocal scanning laser microscope (LSM410 UV, Carl Zeiss Inc.) following the protocol for double stain by fluorescein isothiocyanate and rhodamine. The Slow Fade Antifade kit (Molecular Probes, Inc.) was used to prevent photobleaching. Retention of calumenin in ER was assayed as follows. Cells transfected with FLAG-calumenin and FLAG-calumenin-ΔHDEF were further incubated for 4 h in serum-free medium. The media were then concentrated using Centricon-30 (Amicon). Cell extracts and concentrated media were analyzed by 12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with SDS followed by Western blotting. The reverse transcriptase-PCR method. After first strand synthesis using random 9-mer, PCR was performed with C39N3 primer (GGA-AGA-TGG-ACA-AGG-AAG-AGA-CC) and C39C1b primer (biotinylated) (AGA-GTT-GTT-CCT-CGG-AAG-CTC-G). Transfection of COS-7 cells was performed using lipofectamine (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Protein synthesis was stopped before protein purification and immunostaining assay by treating cells with 300 μm cycloheximide for 2 h (34Obrig T.G. Culp W.J. McKeehan W.L. Hardesty B. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 174-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The filter for Northern blot was prepared as described (35Nakamura T. Tashiro K. Nazarea M Nakano T. Sasayama S. Honjo T. Genomics. 1995; 30: 312-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and hybridized using Quick-Hyb solution (Stratagene). The 45Ca2+binding assay was performed as described (36Maruyama K. Mikawa T. Ebashi S. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1984; 95: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Membranes of45Ca2+ binding assay and Northern blotting was analyzed using an image analyzer (BAS 2000, Fuji Film). Deglycosylation assay was done as described (18Scherer P.E. Lederkremer G.Z. Williams S. Fogliano M. Baldini G. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 257-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. For Western blotting, ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Life Science, Inc.) was used. Chromosomal mapping of the calumenin gene was done as described (35Nakamura T. Tashiro K. Nazarea M Nakano T. Sasayama S. Honjo T. Genomics. 1995; 30: 312-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar,37Manly K.F. Mamm. Genome. 1993; 4: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). 4.4 × 105 yeast transformants from 9.5 dpc embryonic heart cDNA library were screened, and 386 positive clones were obtained by the signal sequence trap method described previously (30Tashiro K. Tada H. Heilker R. Shirozu M. Nakano T. Honjo T. Science. 1993; 261: 600-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 31Jacobs, K. (July 16, 1996) U.S. Patent 5,536,637.Google Scholar). Among these, nucleotide sequences of 17 clones were not reported in any mammalian species, 15 clones were homologous to sequences reported in mouse or other mammals and the rest were redundant clones. One of the novel clones (C39) was picked up for further studies because its mRNA was most strongly expressed in heart (see below). The full-length cDNA of C39 was isolated from a 13.5 dpc embryonic heart cDNA library by the 3′-RACE method. Nucleotide sequences of two independent clones were determined to avoid sequence errors and shown to encode a 315-amino acid protein (Fig.1 A). The translation start site was assigned at nucleotide positions 36–38 because of the presence of an NH2-terminal signal sequence and the comparison with other family members to be described below. cDNA sequence showed that the C39 protein does not have any other hydrophobic stretch long enough to anchor the protein in the membrane (Fig. 1 B). The C39 protein carries six potential Ca2+-binding EF-hand motifs and a putativeN-glycosylation site. Homology search with the BLAST and FASTA computer program revealed the presence of many Ca2+-binding proteins homologous to the C39 protein in the EF-hand region. Among these, reticulocalbin (16Ozawa M. Muramatsu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 699-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Erc-55 (17Weis K. Griffiths G. Lamond A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19142-19150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the ER and Cab45 (18Scherer P.E. Lederkremer G.Z. Williams S. Fogliano M. Baldini G. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 257-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) in the Golgi apparatus had homology in size and sequence to the C39 protein even outside of the EF-hand region (Fig.2). These proteins appear to form one subfamily of Ca2+-binding proteins. Each EF hand in the C39 protein has the general feature for high affinity Ca2+-binding according to Kretsinger's rule (38Kretsinger R.H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1980; 356: 14-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar); the presence of the helix-loop-helix motif in which 5 oxygen-containing residues and the central glycine are conserved for coordination of Ca2+ binding (Fig. 3 A). Although the central glycine of the third motif is replaced by leucine, the same replacement was seen in other Ca2+-binding proteins (39Dang C.V. Ebert R.F. Bell W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9713-9719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,40Engel J. Taylor W. Paulsson M. Sage H. Hogan B. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6958-6965Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and considered to retain the Ca2+-binding activity by the secondary structure prediction of computer analysis (41Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1978; 47: 45-148PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether six EF hands in the C39 protein really have Ca2+-binding ability, the 45Ca2+binding assay was performed as described (36Maruyama K. Mikawa T. Ebashi S. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1984; 95: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Strong signal was detected in the FLAG-C39 fusion protein but none in the FLAG-bacterial alkali phosphatase fusion protein (Fig. 3 B). The positive band was approximately 57 kDa in size, which was equal to the size of the FLAG-C39 fusion protein detected by Amido Black staining, indicating that EF hands in the C39 protein indeed have Ca2+ binding ability. To determine the intracellular localization of the C39 protein, COS-7 cells transfected with FLAG-C39 were doubly stained with an anti-FLAG antibody and an anti-protein-disulfide isomerase antibody and observed under a confocal laser microscope. The staining profile of anti-FLAG antibody (Fig.4 B) was almost identical to that of anti-protein-disulfide isomerase antibody (Fig. 4 A), showing diffuse ER staining patterns as reported previously for protein-disulfide isomerase, a well characterized protein in the ER (42Vaux D. Tooze J. Fuller S. Nature. 1990; 345: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The identical staining patterns with both antibodies (Fig.4 C) indicate that the C39 protein is an ER-resident protein. Since the C39 protein has Ca2+-binding ability and is localized in the ER lumen, we named the C39 protein calumenin. To examine whether the C-terminal tetrapeptide HDEF of calumenin can serve as a novel intracellular retention signal, we constructed two expression vectors: FLAG-calumenin, a fusion protein of FLAG epitope and calumenin, and FLAG-calumenin-ΔHDEF, a fusion protein of the FLAG epitope and calumenin lacking its C-terminal HDEF sequence. FLAG epitopes were incorporated 5 amino acids downstream of the putative signal sequence cleavage site in each construct. COS-7 cells were transfected by these constructs, and concentrated media and cell extracts were analyzed by Western blotting. Most of the FLAG-calumenin-ΔHDEF protein was secreted into the medium, while almost all of the FLAG-calumenin protein was retained in the cell (Fig.5). These results indicate that HDEF is essential to maintain calumenin within the cell. We further examined intracellular localization of calumenin by treatment with deglycosidases. Proteins translocated into the ER are exposed to core glycosylation. At this moment, glycosylated proteins are sensitive to the deglycosidase endoglycosidase H, which cleaves high mannose oligosaccharides on proteins. However, once proteins are transported into the medial Golgi and modified by Golgi-mannosidase II, they become resistant to endoglycosidase H. However, Golgi proteins are still sensitive to N-glycosidase F, a glycosidase whose activity is not disturbed by the following carbohydrate modifications in the medial- and trans-Golgi. Calumenin had one putativeN-linked glycosylation site. Affinity-purified FLAG-calumenin protein was incubated with either endoglycosidase H orN-glycosidase F and subjected to Western blotting with the anti-FLAG M2 antibody. We also performed the assay against FLAG-calumenin-rHDEL, whose C-terminal tetrapeptide HDEF was replaced with HDEL, known as the ER retention signal. Both FLAG-calumenin and FLAG-calumenin-rHDEL showed strong bands at 57 kDa without the glycosidases (Fig. 6, lanes 1, 3,5, and 7). Digestion with either endoglycosidase H or N-glycosidase F shifted the size of the strong bands to 52 kDa (lanes 2, 4, 6, and8). We consider that 57-kDa bands correspond to the glycosylated form of calumenin, and 52-kDa bands correspond to the deglycosylated form. Calumenin is indeed translocated and glycosylated in the ER and not modified in the Golgi apparatus, because Endo H completely cleaved oligosaccharides on FLAG-calumenin (lanes 2 and 6) and FLAG-calumenin-rHDEL (lanes 4and 8). These results indicate that calumenin resides in the ER and that the C-terminal tetrapeptide HDEF works as the ER retention signal like HDEL (16Ozawa M. Muramatsu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 699-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Weis K. Griffiths G. Lamond A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19142-19150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Northern blotting analysis showed that calumenin was expressed ubiquitously in all tissues examined. However, the expression of calumenin was strong especially in heart and lung. Compared with expression in adult heart, expression in 18.5-dpc heart was slightly stronger (Fig. 7 A). The reverse transcriptase-PCR method showed that calumenin mRNA was already expressed as early as 8.5 dpc (Fig. 7 B). To determine the chromosomal localization of the calumenin gene (Calu), 2The gene name Calu for calumenin has been approved by Lois J. Maltais, the Nomenclature Coordinator for the Mouse Genome Data base (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). strain distribution patterns of restriction fragment length polymorphisms of the calumenin gene were determined in 24 independent recombinant inbred strains derived from crosses between AKR/J and DBA/2J (AXD) (TableI). Analysis of the distribution pattern revealed the linkage of the calumenin gene with markers located at the proximal region of chromosome 7 (Fig. 8).Table IStrain distribution patterns of calumenin (Calu) and closely linked markers in RI strains AXDLocusAXD recombinant inbred strain number12367891011121314151618202122232425262728Pmv4ADAADDDDDDDAAAADAAAAADDDXXXCaluADAADADADADAAAADAAAAADDDEmv11ADAADADADADAAAADAAAAADDDXXXCkmmADDADADADAAAAAADAAAADDDDXXXXPmv29ADDADADDDADAAAAAAAAADADDXXXXMagADAADADADAAAAAAAAAAADDDDXUpk1aADAADADADAAAAAAAAAAAUADDAbpaADAADADADAAAAAAAAAAADADDXXXOdc-rs6ADAADDDADDAAAAAAAADADADDXXmv30ADDADDDADDAAAAAAAADADADDTam1ADDADDDADDAAAAAAAADAUADDRestriction fragment length polymorphisms were found by ApaI cleavage of the calumenin in AKR/J (3.8 kilobase pairs) and DBA/2J (4.8 kilobase pairs).

We isolated and characterized a novel Ca2+-binding protein calumenin from mouse embryonic heart. Calumenin is located in the ER and homologous to previously reported Ca2+-binding proteins such as reticulocalbin and Erc-55 in the ER (16Ozawa M. Muramatsu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 699-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Weis K. Griffiths G. Lamond A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19142-19150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and Cab45 (18Scherer P.E. Lederkremer G.Z. Williams S. Fogliano M. Baldini G. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 257-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) in the Golgi apparatus. Since all of these proteins including calumenin have six EF hands and Ca2+-binding activity, they constitute one subset of the EF-hand superfamily. A data base search also revealed that cDNA (λSCF13) cloned as DNA supercoiling factor of silkworm (43Ohta T. Kobayashi M. Hirose S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15571-15575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) also belongs to this family. The deduced amino acid sequence of λSCF13 has an amino-terminal signal sequence, six EF hands, and the C-terminal HDEF sequence, which we proved to be the ER retention signal. Although many ER Ca2+-binding proteins have been reported so far, their functions are largely not yet well understood. Two possible functions of ER Ca2+-binding proteins have been suggested. First, calreticulin, one of the Ca2+-binding proteins in the ER, is reported to regulate the capacity of Ca2+ in the ER (44Bastianutto C. Clementi E. Codazzi F. Podini P. De Giorgi F. Rizzuto R. Meldolesi J. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 847-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 45Camacho P. Lechleiter J.D. Cell. 1995; 82: 765-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) as well as to have chaperone function (46Nauseef W.M. McCormick S.J. Clark R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4741-4747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 47Wada I. Imai S. Kai M. Sakane F. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20298-20304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Another luminal Ca2+-binding protein, calsequestrin, is also reported to regulate Ca2+ flow from the ER (48Kawasaki T. Kasai M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 1120-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 49Ikemoto N. Ronjat M. Meszaros L.G. Koshita M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6764-6771Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). These reports suggest that Ca2+ fluxes may be regulated somehow by Ca2+-binding proteins located in the luminal side of the ER. Second, Ca2+ in the ER is reported to be necessary for normal functions of the ER such as protein folding and protein sorting (3Booth C. Koch G.L. Cell. 1989; 59: 729-737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 4Lodish H.F. Kong N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10893-10899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Wikstrom L.

Chem. 1991; 266: 4500-4507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting the existence of ER-resident molecules whose function is regulated by Ca2+. In fact, Bip, a Ca2+-binding protein in the ER, is reported to function in the Ca2+-dependent manner (50Suzuki C.K. Bonifacino J.S. Lin A.Y. Davis M.M. Klausner R.D. J. Cell. Biol. 1991; 114: 189-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Further study is needed to determine whether or not calumenin is involved in either of the two possible functions. Recently, interaction molecules of Erc-55 have been reported: the E6 protein of papilloma virus, which has p53-independent tumorigenic activity (51Chen J.J. Reid C.E. Band V. Androphy E.J. Science. 1995; 269: 529-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), and taipoxin, which blocks neuromuscular transmission at the presynaptic site (52Dodds D. Anne K. Lu S. Perin M.S. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2339-2344Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). As discussed above, calumenin belongs to the same subset of the EF-hand superfamily as Erc-55. Thus, the search for proteins that interact with calumenin could provide a clue to elucidate biological functions of this subset. We report a novel carboxyl-terminal tetrapeptide HDEF of calumenin as a new ER retention signal to prevent proteins from being secreted and to keep them in the ER. We observed that the HDEF sequence had the intracellular retention activity (Fig. 5). The deglycosylation assay (Fig. 6) and the immunostaining profile (Fig. 4) suggest that the HDEF sequence works as the ER retention signal. The C-terminal tetrapeptide KDEL is the first ER retention signal reported in mammalian cells (20Munro S. Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1987; 48: 899-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1553) Google Scholar). The C-terminal tetrapeptide HDEL, which was originally identified in yeast, was also found to work as the ER retention signal in mammalian cells (16Ozawa M. Muramatsu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 699-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Weis K. Griffiths G. Lamond A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19142-19150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other reports show that the first and second positions of the C-terminal tetrapeptide are not strongly conserved to maintain the ER retention activity. In contrast, replacement of the third and fourth residues is strictly restricted. The third position requires an acidic residue such as Glu or Asp, and the fourth position requires a hydrophobic residue containing the aliphatic side chain such as Leu or Ile, which cannot be replaced by either Val or Ala (24Andres D.A. Dickerson I.M. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5952-5955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Andres D.A. Rhodes J.D. Meisel R.L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14277-14282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since Cab45, a soluble protein in the Golgi apparatus has HEEF sequence at the C terminus, this tetraresidue sequence was presumed to serve as the Golgi retention signal. The C-terminal Phe, a hydrophobic residue containing an aromatic side chain, was thought to work somehow differently from Leu (18Scherer P.E. Lederkremer G.Z. Williams S. Fogliano M. Baldini G. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 257-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, since our study clearly showed that the HDEF sequence worked as the ER retention signal, the retention signal to the Golgi apparatus may be localized in another portion of Cab45. Proteins with ER retention signals such as KDEL are retrieved from Golgi. The convincing mechanism of this retrieval is that such proteins interact with the KDEL receptor distributing in the cis-Golgi and are retrieved to the ER (22Tang B.L. Wong S.H. Qi X.L. Low S.H. Hong W. J. Cell. Biol. 1993; 120: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 23Lewis M.J. Sweet D.J. Pelham H.R. Cell. 1990; 61: 1359-1363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). We showed that the C-terminal HDEF sequence worked as the ER retention signal, but further investigation is needed to determine whether HDEF interacts with the KDEL receptor or with an unknown receptor. The calumenin gene was mapped on the proximal portion of mouse chromosome 7. This region is well conserved between human and mouse, and the syntenic comparison suggests that this region corresponds to human 19q13.2–13.3 (53Brilliant M.H. Williams R.W. Conti C.J. Angel J.M. Oakey R.J. Holdener B.C. Mamm. Genome. 1994; 5: S104-S123PubMed Google Scholar), at which the gene for progressive familial heart block type I, autosomal dominantly inherited cardiac bundle-branch disorder, is mapped (54Brink P.A.

Since the causal gene of this disease has not been determined so far, further investigation is needed to determine whether the calumenin gene is involved in this disease. We thank Dr. T. Nakano very much for the suggestion of constructing a cDNA library for the signal sequence trap method. We also thank N. Tomikawa for technical assistance, and Y. Horiike for secretarial help."

To elucidate the mechanism by which staurosporine induces neurite outgrowth in PC-12 cells, we performed an in-gel kinase assay using myelin basic protein as a substrate, and found that staurosporine induced the activation of a kinase with an apparent molecular mass of 57 kDa. The dose of staurosporine required to activate this kinase was consistent with that required to induce neurite outgrowth. Interestingly, the staurosporine-activated kinase was immunoprecipitated by anti-c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) isoforms antibody, but not by anti-JNK1-specific antibody or anti-ERK1 antibody, raising the possibility that this kinase is a novel JNK isoform. The substrate specificity of the kinase was distinct from those of osmotic shock-activated JNKs and NGF-activated ERK1. The kinase phosphorylates transcription factors including c-Jun, Elk-1, and ATF2, as well as myelin basic protein, suggesting that it plays a role in gene induction. Furthermore, staurosporine induced immediate-early genes including Nur77 and fos, but notjun. The activation of the staurosporine-activated kinase, as well as the induction of neurite outgrowth, did not require Ras function, while Ras was required for the activation of ERKs and neurite outgrowth induced by NGF. Taken together, these results indicate staurosporine specifically activates a JNK isoform, which may contribute to biological activities including neurite outgrowth.

The molecular cloning of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNKs), also termed stress-activated protein kinases, led to the identification of JNKs as a member of the MAP kinase family of protein kinases (19Derijard B.

JNKs are activated by inflammatory cytokines and cellular stresses including ultraviolet irradiation, osmotic shock, and treatment with protein synthesis inhibitors, while ERKs are activated by growth factor stimulation (22Su B.

Biol. 1995; 15: 4930-4938Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Activation of JNKs requires the phosphorylation of JNK on Thr and Tyr, which is mediated by a dual specificity protein kinase (19Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2953) Google Scholar). One of the JNK activators, MKK4 is activated by phosphorylation by another protein kinase, MEKK1 (26Derijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar, 27Minden A. Lin A. McMahon M. Lange C.C. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism of MEKK1 activation is not fully understood, it appears that the signaling pathway leading to the activation of JNKs is distinct from the Ras/Raf/MEK signaling pathway, which is responsible for the activation of ERKs. Recent studies identified 10 isoforms of JNKs (28Gupta S. Barrett T. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sluss H.K. Derijard B. Davis R.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2760-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). These isoforms arise from the alternative processing of transcripts from three different genes: those for JNK1, JNK2, and JNK3. Although similar in amino acid sequences, these JNK isoforms have distinct in vitro biochemical properties, suggesting they are not functionally redundant. Consistent with this, it has been shown that JNK1, but not JNK2, complements a defect in the expression of the MAP kinase, HOG1 in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (21Sluss H.K. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8376-8384Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). A number of chemical compounds have been reported to induce neurite outgrowth. In this study, we investigated staurosporine-induced neurite outgrowth, and found staurosporine activated a protein kinase with an apparent molecular mass of 57 kDa. Interestingly, the staurosporine-activated kinase was recognized by anti-JNK isoforms antibody, but not by anti-JNK1-specific or anti-ERK1-specific antibody, suggesting this kinase is a JNK. However, the apparent molecular mass of this kinase was different from those of osmotic shock-activated JNKs whose molecular masses were 46 and 55 kDa. Interestingly, staurosporine did not activate osmotic shock-activated kinases, and conversely, osmotic shock did not induce the staurosporine-activated kinase activation. Furthermore, the substrate specificity of the staurosporine-activated kinase was different from that of JNK1 and ERK1. Taken together these results indicate that staurosporine specifically activates a JNK-related kinase, which is different from well characterized stress-activated JNKs. The staurosporine-activated kinase has a distinct substrate specificity, raising the possibility that it is involved in distinct biological activity including differentiation. PC-12 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 5% calf serum. PC-12 cells expressing RasN17 (M-M17-26 cells, provided by Geoffrey M. Cooper (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) (8Szeberenyi J. Cai H. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5324-5332Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 5% calf serum, and 400 μg/ml G418. The GST-c-Jun, GST-Elk-1, and GST-ATF2 expression plasmids were provided by Roger J. Davis (University of Massachusetts, Worcester). These plasmids were expressed in a bacteria strain, BL21(DE3), and GST fusion proteins were purified by glutathione chromatography as described (29Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5043) Google Scholar). In-gel kinase assay was performed essentially as described previously (30Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Yamashita T. Hoshi M. Kawakami M. Sakai H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193 (2nd Ed.): 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Subconfluent dishes of PC-12 cells or PC-12 cells expressing RasN17 were lysed in MAP kinase extraction buffer, and the protein concentration was determined by Bio-Rad protein assay. To assay total cell lysate, equal amounts of protein (50–100 μg) were electrophoresed in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing either myelin basic protein (MBP) (0.5 mg/ml), GST-c-Jun (1–79) (0.1 mg/ml), GST-ATF2 (0.1 mg/ml), or GST-Elk-1 (0.1 mg/ml) as a substrate. For immunoprecipitation, the NaCl concentration of the cell extract was adjusted to 150 mm, 2 μg of each antibody was added to 100 μl of cell extract containing 500 μg of protein, and incubation carried out for 1 h at 4 °C. Anti-JNK isoforms antibody and anti-ERK1 antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-JNK1-specific antibody was purchased from PharMingen (San Diego, CA). Next, 50 μl of 10% protein A-Sepharose was added and the mixture incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose beads were collected by centrifugation and washed four times with MAP kinase extraction buffer. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer was added to protein A-Sepharose beads and samples were electrophoresed in SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing various substrates as indicated. Following electrophoresis, SDS were removed from the gel, protein was renatured, and a kinase assay was carried out by incubating the gel in buffer containing [γ-32P]ATP. Gels were washed, and incorporated radioactivity was quantified using an image analyzer (BAS2000, Fuji Film Co. Ltd., Japan). Total cytoplasmic RNA was isolated as described (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). RNAs (15 μg) were electrophoresed in 1% formaldehyde-agarose gels and transferred to Biodyne-B membrane (East Hills, NY). Filters were prehybridized, hybridized and washed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The following DNA fragments were32P-labeled with a random priming kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) for use as probes: fos, a 1-kb PstI fragment from pfos-1 (32Curran T. Peters G. Van B.C. Teich N.M. Verma I.M. J. Virol. 1982; 44: 674-682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); jun, a 0.9-kb PstI fragment of human jun (33Bohmann D. Bos T.J. Admon A. Nishimura T. Vogt P.K. Tjian R. Science. 1987; 238: 1386-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar); Nur77, a 1.9-kbEcoRI-KpnI fragment from a pGEM-Nur77 construct (34Hazel T.G. Nathans D. Lau L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8444-8448Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). We studied differentiation in PC-12 cells induced by chemical compounds and found that staurosporine was a potent inducer of neurite outgrowth. As reported (35Hashimoto S. Hagino A. Exp. Cell. Res. 1989; 184: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 36Tischler A.S. Ruzicka L.A. Perlman R.L. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 1159-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), staurosporine induced neurite outgrowth at concentrations of as low as 4–20 ng/ml, with maximal induction obtained at 100 ng/ml (Fig. 1). Staurosporine induced neurite outgrowth faster than NGF. After 6 h of staurosporine treatment, small neurites were observed. Maximal neurite outgrowth was obtained after 24 h of treatment, and was comparable to that obtained by 3 days of treatment with NGF. We also tested K-252a, a staurosporine-related compound that exhibits similar effects on a variety of kinases, and found that K-252a did not induce neurite outgrowth at a similar range of concentration (date not shown). Since ERK1 and ERK2 of the MAP kinase family have been shown to play an important role in NGF-induced differentiation (18Fukuda M. Gotoh Y. Tachibana T. Dell K. Hattori S. Yoneda Y. Nishida E. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 239-244PubMed Google Scholar), we tested whether staurosporine can induce MAP kinases. To this end, we conducted an in-gel kinase assay using MBP as a substrate (Fig.2). Consistent with previous reports (30Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Yamashita T. Hoshi M. Kawakami M. Sakai H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193 (2nd Ed.): 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), NGF strongly induced ERK1 and ERK2 at 5 min after stimulation and the activity decreased with time. Interestingly, staurosporine induced a kinase with an apparent molecular mass of 57 kDa (Fig. 2 A). When MBP was omitted from the gel, this band was not detected, indicating the phosphorylation was not due to autophosphorylation (data not shown). In contrast to the rapid and transient NGF-induced activation of ERKs, staurosporine induced a prolonged activation of the 57-kDa kinase (Fig.2 B). Weak activation was observed at 5 min after stimulation, and maximal activation was obtained at 120 min after stimulation. Weak activation of the kinase was induced with staurosporine treatment as low as 4 ng/ml, while maximal activation was obtained at a concentration of 100 ng/ml (Fig. 2 C). Differences in molecular mass indicate that the staurosporine activated kinase is distinct from ERK1 and ERK2, both of which are thought to be involved in NGF-induced differentiation. However, the concentration of staurosporine required for the activation of the 57-kDa kinase was similar to that required for the induction of neurite outgrowth, raising the possibility that the 57-kDa kinase plays a role in staurosporine-induced neurite outgrowth. Consistent with this, K-252a, a compound similar to staurosporine in its structure and biological activities in inhibiting kinases, did not induce neurite outgrowth and did not induce the activation of the 57-kDa kinase (date not shown). The MAP kinase family is part of a large family of serine-threonine protein kinases (19Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2953) Google Scholar, 20Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R.

Biol. 1994; 14: 8376-8384Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Since JNKs are a subfamily of the MAP kinase family, we tested whether the staurosporine-activated kinase belongs to the JNK subfamily. To this end, we used three antibodies. 1) Anti-JNK isoforms antibody was raised against a full length recombinant protein of JNK2, and recognizes JNK1 and JNK2. 2) Anti-JNK1-specific antibody recognizes only JNK1. 3) Anti-ERK1 antibody recognizes ERK1 specifically. Using these antibodies, we immunoprecipitated JNKs and ERK1 from cells treated with either NGF, staurosporine or osmotic shock and tested for their kinase activities using an in-gel kinase assay (Fig. 3). As expected, NGF induced kinases with molecular masses of 42 and 44 kDa, and the 44-kDa kinase was recognized by anti-ERK1 antibody, but not by anti-JNK isoforms antibody or anti-JNK1-specific antibody, indicating NGF specifically activates ERK1 and ERK2. Osmotic shock, induced by treatment of cells with 0.5 m sorbitol for 30 min, induced the activation of kinases with molecular masses of 46 and 55 kDa, which probably represent mixtures of JNK1 and JNK2 (28Gupta S. Barrett T. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sluss H.K. Derijard B. Davis R.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2760-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, these kinases were recognized by anti-JNK isoforms antibody and anti-JNK1-specific antibody, but not by anti-ERK1 antibody. Anti-JNK isoforms antibody only recognized the 55-kDa isoform of JNKs, which is probably due to the preferential recognition of the COOH-terminal region of JNKs by this antibody. The kinase activated by staurosporine was recognized by anti-JNK isoforms antibody, but not by anti-JNK1-specific antibody or anti-ERK1 antibody. Note that the staurosporine-activated kinase has a slower mobility in SDS-polyacrylamide gel compared with those activated by osmotic shock, indicating they are distinct kinases (Figs. 3 and 4). Furthermore, the 57-kDa kinase was the only kinase induced by staurosporine treatment.Figure 4The substrate specificity of the staurosporine-activated kinase. Cells were left untreated (−) or incubated with 100 ng/ml NGF for 5 min (NGF), 100 ng/ml staurosporine for 120 min (SSP), or 0.5 msorbitol for 30 min (SRB). Immunoprecipitation was performed as described under “Materials and Methods.” The kinase activity was determined by an in-gel kinase assay using as a substrate the protein indicated. The positions of staurosporine-activated kinase, JNK1, and ERK1 are indicated by arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although the staurosporine-activated kinase was recognized by anti-JNK isoforms antibody, it is possible that the signal detected by an in-gel kinase assay represented multiple kinase activities. To test this possibility, we analyzed the staurosporine-treated cell extract by chromatography using a Mono Q column. Since only a single peak of 57-kDa kinase activity was identified (data not shown), it is therefore unlikely that the 57-kDa kinase activity detected by an in-gel kinase assay contains multiple kinase activities. Taken together, these results indicate that staurosporine specifically activates a kinase that is immunologically related to JNKs, but is distinct from JNK1 and JNK2. It has been reported that ERKs and JNKs have a different substrate specificity, which is thought to contribute to their distinct biological activities. We therefore determined the substrate specificity of the staurosporine-activated kinase (Fig. 4). As expected, ERK1 that was activated by NGF efficiently phosphorylated MBP and Elk-1. In contrast, JNK1 activated by osmotic shock strongly phosphorylated ATF2, and, to a lesser extent, Elk-1 and c-Jun. However, the staurosporine-activated kinase phosphorylated MBP, Elk-1, ATF2, and c-Jun. These results indicate that, although the staurosporine-activated kinase is related to JNKs, it has a different substrate specificity to JNK1 and ERK1. Both ERKs and JNKs are believed to regulate gene expression by phosphorylating transcription factors (37Davis R.J. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 42: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Similarly, the staurosporine-activated kinase was able to phosphorylate several transcription factors. However, since the staurosporine-activated kinase had a distinct substrate specificity, we tested whether staurosporine can induce transcription of early response genes including Nur77, fos, and jun (Fig.5). Interestingly, staurosporine inducedNur77 and fos transcription. Quantitation of the induction indicated that the induction of Nur77 by staurosporine was 2.9-fold at 3 h after stimulation, while that by NGF was 12.8-fold at 45 min after stimulation. Similarly, staurosporine induced fos transcription by 1.9-fold after 2 h of stimulation, while NGF induced fos transcription by 8.0-fold after 45 min of stimulation. Although the induction of Nur77and fos by staurosporine was smaller than that of NGF, the induction of these genes by staurosporine is significant, becausejun was not induced by staurosporine. It is worthy to note that staurosporine induced prolonged transcriptional activation with a maximal activation at 180 min after treatment, while NGF-induced transcriptional activation was more rapid and transient. Thus it appears staurosporine induces transcriptional activation of early response genes, but the induction was different from that by NGF with respect to spices of genes and time course of the induction. It has been shown that the signaling pathways leading to the activation of ERKs and JNKs are distinct (27Minden A. Lin A. McMahon M. Lange C.C. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). Since Ras function is necessary for the NGF-induced activation of ERKs as well as the NGF-induced neurite outgrowth, we investigated whether Ras is required for activation of the 57-kDa kinase and neurite outgrowth in PC-12 cells induced by staurosporine (Fig. 6). As previously reported (14Thomas S.M. DeMarco M. D'Arcangelo G. Halegoua S. Brugge J.S. Cell. 1992; 68: 1031-1040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 15Wood K. Sarnecki C. Roberts T.M. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 68: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar), NGF did not induce activation of ERKs in dominant inhibitory mutant Ras (RasN17)-expressing PC-12 cells. In contrast, staurosporine did activate the 57-kDa kinase in RasN17-expressing PC-12 cells to an extent similar to that in wild type PC-12 cells. Similarly, Ras function was not required for the activation of JNKs induced by osmotic shock. Similar results were obtained in neurite outgrowth in PC-12 cells (Fig.7). RasN17 interfered with NGF-induced neurite outgrowth, but not staurosporine-induced neurite outgrowth. These results suggest that staurosporine and NGF induce neurite outgrowth via distinct signaling pathways. ERK1 and ERK2 of the MAP kinase family play a key role in NGF-induced neuronal differentiation in PC-12 cells. Since staurosporine is a potent inhibitor of protein kinases and also an inducer of neurite outgrowth in PC-12 cells, in this study, we first investigated whether staurosporine activates the signaling pathway that leads to the activation of members of the MAP kinase family. Interestingly, we found that staurosporine activated a kinase detected by an in-gel kinase assay using MBP as a substrate. This kinase differed from known ERKs in molecular mass, and in that it was not recognized by anti-ERK1-specific antibody. However, it was recognized by anti-JNK isoforms antibody, which recognizes JNK1, JNK2, and probably other isoforms of JNKs. Therefore it is most likely that this staurosporine-activated kinase is a JNK. The finding that staurosporine activates a member of the JNK family is consistent with a previous report (38Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mass of the kinase is 57 kDa, which is distinct from those of well characterized JNKs activated by various stimuli including osmotic shock (Figs. 3 and 4). Furthermore, the substrate specificity of the kinase was also distinct (Fig. 4). Recent detailed analysis led to the identification of 10 different JNK isoforms that arise from the alternative processing of transcripts from three different genes (28Gupta S. Barrett T. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sluss H.K. Derijard B. Davis R.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2760-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). It turned out that the JNKs with the molecular mass of 46 and 55 kDa represented a mixture of JNK isoforms. Thus it is possible that the staurosporine-activated kinase is a novel JNK isoform. Consistent with this, anti-JNK1-specific antibody did not recognize the staurosporine-activated kinase. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that this kinase is identical to JNK3-α2, which has a molecular mass of 57 kDa (28Gupta S. Barrett T. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sluss H.K. Derijard B. Davis R.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2760-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). If this is the case, our paper is the first to describe the activation and the distinct substrate specificity of JNK3-α2. Since staurosporine inhibits a variety of kinases including the ERKs of the MAP kinase family, it is unlikely that staurosporine activates the 57-kDa kinase by a direct interaction. Members of the MAP kinase family of protein kinases are known to be activated by several signaling pathways. It is interesting to note that staurosporine did not activate JNKs having molecular masses of 46 and 55 kDa. Conversely, osmotic shock failed to activate the 57-kDa kinase. It thus appeared that the signaling pathway leading to the activation of the 57-kDa kinase is specifically activated by staurosporine. It has been shown that JNKs become active only when a Thr and a Tyr residue in a Thr-Pro-Tyr motif are phosphorylated (19Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2953) Google Scholar). Although a kinase, MKK4, was identified as being responsible for this phosphorylation (26Derijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar), the involvement of several other JNK kinases has also been suggested (39Moriguchi T. Kawasaki H. Matsuda S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12969-12972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 40Meier R. Rouse J. Cuenda A. Nebreda A.R. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 796-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). It is established that ERKs and JNKs are activated by distinct signaling pathways as defined by MAP kinase kinases (also termed MKKs or SAPKs) (41Zhou G. Bao Z.Q. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12665-12669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 42English J.M. Vanderbilt C.A. Xu S. Marcus S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol.

Matsumoto K. Nishida E. Hagiwara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13675-13679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). However, to our knowledge, no specific signaling pathway that distinguishes JNK isoforms has been reported. Staurosporine specifically activates the 57-kDa kinase. Thus, we conclude by suggesting that staurosporine activates a specific kinase cascade which leads to the activation of the 57-kDa kinase, but not other isoforms of JNKs. Staurosporine was originally considered to be a specific inhibitor of protein kinase C, but further studies revealed it also inhibits a variety of tyrosine kinases as well as serine-threonine kinases. At this point, it is not clear whether the inhibition of kinase(s) contributes to the activation of the 57-kDa kinase. However, a structurally related compound, K-252a, which also inhibits protein kinases, did not activate the 57-kDa kinase (data not shown). Similarly, K-252a did not induce neurite outgrowth in PC-12 cells (data not shown; Ref. 35Hashimoto S. Hagino A. Exp. Cell. Res. 1989; 184: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These results suggest the action of staurosporine to induce the 57-kDa kinase activation and neurite outgrowth is not due to the inhibition of kinases. Staurosporine did not activate ERK1 and ERK2 of MAP kinases, which play an important role in NGF-induced differentiation. However, the 57-kDa kinase activated by staurosporine phosphorylated MBP and ERK1, which suggests the 57-kDa kinase can phosphorylate and activate common downstream target(s) to ERKs. Furthermore, the concentrations required for the activation of the 57-kDa kinase and for the induction of neurite outgrowth are almost the same, which suggest the involvement of the 57-kDa kinase in the induction of neurite outgrowth. This conclusion is supported by experiments using a compound, K-252a, which is structurally similar to staurosporine and also has similar inhibition profile on a variety of kinases. Despite these similarities, K-252a did not induce neurite outgrowth, and importantly, failed to activate the 57-kDa kinase. The MAP kinases are part of a large family of serine-threonine protein kinases. However, their physiological roles are thought to be distinct. For example, ERKs are thought to play a key role in the differentiation of PC-12 cells, while JNKs may play a role in induction of apoptosis (18Fukuda M. Gotoh Y. Tachibana T. Dell K. Hattori S. Yoneda Y. Nishida E. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 239-244PubMed Google Scholar, 38Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, the substrate specificities of these kinases are different. MBP is effectively phosphorylated by ERK1, while ATF2 was strongly phosphorylated by JNK1. Interestingly, the staurosporine-activated 57-kDa kinase phosphorylated both MBP and ATF2 as well as Elk-1 and c-Jun, suggesting the staurosporine-activated kinase may have similar but distinct biological roles. Consistent with this, staurosporine induced transcriptional activation of Nur77 and fos, but not jun. Furthermore, although staurosporine induces neurite outgrowth in PC-12 cells, it also has been reported that apoptosis was induced by staurosporine under certain conditions (38Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar). InDrosophila, recent studies revealed that a JNK homolog mediates cell morphogenesis and an immune response (44Sluss H.K. Han Z. Barrett T. Davis R.J. Ip Y.T.

Further studies will be necessary to identify the biological significance of the staurosporine-activated kinase. We are grateful to R. Davis for providing plasmids encoding GST-c-Jun, GST-ATF2, and GST-Elk-1. We also thank T. Endo, T. Sudo, and T. Usui for their helpful suggestions."
https://openalex.org/W1991078847,"The secretion of renin from granules stored in renal juxtaglomerular cells plays a key role in blood pressure homeostasis. The synthesis and release of renin and the extent of granulation is regulated by several mechanisms including signaling from the macula densa, neuronal input, and blood pressure. Through the use of a gene-targeting vector containing homology arms generated using the polymerase chain reaction, we have inactivated theRen-1 d gene, one of two mouse genes encoding renin, and report that lack of renin-1 d results in altered morphology of the macula densa of the kidney distal tubule and complete absence of juxtaglomerular cell granulation. Furthermore,Ren-1 d−/− mice exhibit sexually dimorphic hypotension. The altered growth morphology of the macula densa in Ren-1d-null mice should provide a tool for the investigation of the JG cell-macula densa signaling. Furthermore, the current data indicate that expression of theRen-1 d gene is a prerequisite for the formation of storage granules, even though the related protein renin-2 is present in these mice, suggesting that renin-1 d and renin-2 are secreted by distinct pathways in vivo.

Renin (EC 3.4.23.15) is an aspartyl protease, which catalyzes the first step in the renin angiotensin system, the end product of which is the potent vasopressor peptide hormone, angiotensin II (AngII). 1The abbreviations used are as follows: Ang, angiotensin; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; JG, juxtaglomerular; SMG, submandibular gland; DIA/LIF, differentiation inhibiting activity/leukemia inhibitory factor; PRC, plasma renin concentration; PPC, plasma prorenin concentration; kb, kilobase pairs; bp, base pair(s); TES,N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid. This octapeptide acts to increase peripheral vascular resistance and promote salt and fluid retention in concert with the hormone aldosterone. Renin is synthesized principally in the kidney juxtaglomerular (JG) cells, a group of modified smooth muscle cells located at the distal end of the renal afferent arteriole of the glomerulus (1Taugner, R., and Hackenthal, E. (eds) (1989) The Juxtaglomerular Apparatus: Structure and Function, Springer-Verlag, BerlinGoogle Scholar). JG cells are in close contact with the macula densa, a specialized plaque of epithelial cells of the kidney distal tubule, which signal to the renal arterioles to regulate glomerular filtration rate and the secretion of renin, in response to ionic concentration and flow rate in the distal tubule (2Briggs J.P. Schnermann J.B. Kidney Int. 1996; 49: 1724-1726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 3Sk⊘tt O. Briggs J.P. Science. 1987; 237: 1618-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), the so-called tubuloglomerular feedback loop. Except for the submandibular gland (SMG) of the mouse, the JG cells are the only site where prorenin, the inactive zymogen, is known to be converted to the active form of renin. SMG renin does not, however, make its way into the plasma in large quantities and is thought not to play a significant role in blood pressure regulation under normal circumstances (reviewed in Binget al. (4Bing J. Poulsen K. Hackenthal E. Rix E. Taugner R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1980; 28: 874-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar)). The release of renin from JG cells is mediated by two pathways: regulated release of the mature, active renin from modified lysosomal storage granules and constitutive release of the inactive zymogen. While the regulated pathway of renin secretion is responsive to baroreceptor, neurogenic, and macula densa signals (5King J.A. Lush D.J. Fray J.C.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C305-C320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the physiological significance of the constitutive secretion of prorenin is not understood, nor are the molecular pathways that link secretory signals to renin maturation and release. Clarification of the mechanisms underlying these processes will be crucial to our understanding of the control of renin activity locally in the renal glomerulus, and in the plasma, and the regulation of fluid and ion homeostasis. Human and rat genomes contain a single gene for renin, but mice display two alternative genotypes at the Ren locus. Thus some inbred mouse strains (e.g. strain C57BL/6) have only a single renin structural gene, termed Ren-1 c, while others (e.g. DBA/2 and 129) possess two renin genes, termedRen-1 d and Ren-2. This probably results from the recent duplication of 21 kb of DNA containing aRen-1 c-like ancestral gene (6Dickinson D.P. Gross K.W. Piccini N. Wilson C.M. Genetics. 1984; 108: 651-667Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Abel K.J. Gross K.W. Genetics. 1990; 124: 937-947Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All three mouse renin genes share the same overall genomic organization and encode highly homologous, but distinct, proteins, with approximately 97% similarity at the amino acid level, but having different glycosylation potentials (reviewed in Ref. 8Sigmund C.D. Gross K.W. Hypertension. 1991; 18: 446-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This arises because the renin-2 enzyme lacks putative consensus sites for asparagine-linked glycosylation, whereas renin-1 c and renin-1 d proteins can be glycosylated at three asparagine residues. The mouse renin genes are expressed in distinct, although overlapping, tissue-specific and developmental patterns (8Sigmund C.D. Gross K.W. Hypertension. 1991; 18: 446-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). It has therefore been difficult to dissect the individual roles of each gene to date or to determine if renin-1 d and renin-2 play functionally equivalent rolesin vivo. For example, Ren-1 d andRen-2 are expressed at equivalent levels in JG cells, butRen-2 is expressed at high levels (2% of total SMG protein) in the submandibular gland and is under the control of various hormones, including testosterone, whereas Ren-1 d is only detectable at trace levels in this organ (9Miller C.C. Carter A.T. Brooks J.I. Lovell-Badge R.H. Brammar W.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 3117-3128Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The evolution of non-identical, tightly regulated developmental expression profiles, and the biochemical differences between renin-1 and renin-2 proteins, suggest that the two genes may indeed possess functionally distinct properties. The presence of two genetically distinct forms of renin, susceptible to manipulation by gene targeting, offers a unique opportunity to determine the importance of renin glycosylation for its role in vivo and to dissect the functions of renin, which in other animals are subserved by a single gene product. We have reported recently the targeted disruption of the Ren-2 gene in mice (10Sharp M.G.F. Fettes D. Brooker G. Clark A.F. Peters J. Fleming S. Mullins J.J. Hypertension. 1996; 26: 1126-1131Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar), which results in Ren-1 d being the only active renin gene present. Ren-2-null mice display elevated circulating active renin concentrations, and reduced circulating (inactive) prorenin; however, no abnormalities in the histomorphology of adult kidneys, adrenals, or submandibular glands, nor in resting blood pressures, have been found in adult animals to date (10Sharp M.G.F. Fettes D. Brooker G. Clark A.F. Peters J. Fleming S. Mullins J.J. Hypertension. 1996; 26: 1126-1131Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Here, we describe the generation of mice in which the Ren-1 d gene has been inactivated by homologous recombination. As part of a generalized construction strategy, the regions of DNA providingRen-1 d gene homology in the targeting vector have been generated by long-range PCR amplification of isogenic substrate DNA, using a proofreading DNA polymerase. The phenotype ofRen-1 d −/− mice shows that theRen-1 d and Ren-2 genes are not functionally equivalent. First, female mice show a significant reduction in resting blood pressure. Furthermore, the level of plasma active renin is decreased while inactive prorenin is increased. Finally, the deletion of the glycosylated renin-1 results in the complete absence of dense secretory/storage granule formation in JG cells and altered morphology of the macula densa cells of the kidney distal tubule. Regions of Ren-1 d gene homology for incorporation into the targeting vector were generated by long range PCR amplification using, as template, DNA from a bacteriophage P1 clone containing the entire mouse 129 Ren-1 d gene (P1–1249) 2L.

Natural (5′ arm) and artificially introduced (3′ arm) KpnI sites used in cloning are underlined. Reactions (100 μl) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 10 mm KCl, 0.002% (v/v) Tween 20®, 1.0 mmMgCl2, 40 μm each dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP, 5 μm each primer, 10–100 ng of template DNA, and 5 units of UlTma DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer ABI, Warrington, UK) were 40 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 66 °C (5′ arm) or 68 °C (3′ arm) for 1 min and 72 °C for 6.5 min, followed by one period of 10 min at 72 °C. Each PCR product was cloned into a plasmid vector and then manipulated to flank the PGKneo-selectable marker gene. The final targeting vector, pR1neoKO, contained 3.5- and 3.7-kb segments of the Ren-1 d gene flanking the selectable marker gene. ES cells were grown in Glasgow modification of Eagle's medium + 10% fetal calf serum supplemented with mouse or human DIA/LIF on gelatin-coated plastic, as described (11Smith A.G. J. Tissue Cult. Methods. 1991; 13: 89-94Crossref Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Targeting vector DNA (150 μg; pR1neoKO), was linearized by digestion with AscI and MluI and electroporated into 5 × 109E14Tg2a cells (12Hooper M. Hardy K. Handyside A. Hunter S. Monk M. Nature. 1987; 326: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar), a strain 129-derived embryonal stem cell line, with a discharge of 0.8 kV at 3 microfarads on a Bio-Rad gene pulser. Following G418 selection (175 μg/ml), drug-resistant colonies were expanded and genomic DNA prepared (13Laird P.W. Zijderveld A. Linders K. Rudnicki M.A. Jaenisch R. Berns A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19 (4293): 4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar). Homologous recombination events were detected by Southern blotting of DNA digested with SacI and hybridized with an external 5′ probe (a 297-bpPvuII/BamHI fragment, containing exon 1 of theRen-1 d gene). Clones selected in this way were also hybridized with an external 3′ probe after digestion withPvuII (a 746-bp HindIII/NcoI fragment, containing Ren-1 d exon 8 and part of exon 9; see Fig. 1 D). One targeted clone was used to generate male chimaeras, which were crossed with strain 129 females to generate inbred 129 heterozygote offspring. These mice were intercrossed to produce an F2 generation with wild-type, heterozygous and homozygous inbred, Ren-1 d −/− mice. Kidney RNA was amplified by reverse transcription-coupled PCR, using the Expand reverse transcription kit (Boehringer Mannheim, Lewes, UK), according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was randomly primed with hexanucleotides, and renin sequences amplified using primers JJM 56 (5′-CCAGCCCAGACCTTCAAAGTC-3′) and JJM 141 (5′-CCAGACAAATGGCCCCCAAG-3′), specific for exons three and nine of the mouse renin genes, respectively. Amplification was for 10 cycles of 94 °C for 10 s, 62 °C for 20 s and 68 °C for 45 s, plus 25 cycles with a 5-s increment in each 68 °C extension phase. The resulting renin cDNA (999 bp) was digested with EarI, an enzyme that digests Ren-1 d cDNA twice andRen-2 cDNA once. Following sacrifice of animals by CO2 anesthesia, tissues were immersion-fixed in 4% (w/v) formaldehyde, 0.9% (w/v) NaCl for 24 h and embedded in paraffin wax. Subsequently, 2-μm sections from kidneys, submandibular glands, adrenal glands, and testes were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and examined, in a blinded manner, by standard light microscopy. Mean blood pressure (40% of systolic + 60% of diastolic pressures) was measured via direct cannulation of the abdominal aorta in adult mice (8–15 weeks old). Measurements were made over a 15-min period in conscious, resting animals housed in restraining tubes. All animals had undergone training (30 min/day) in restraining tubes for 5 consecutive days, beginning 7 days prior to the operation. Operations were performed as described (10Sharp M.G.F. Fettes D. Brooker G. Clark A.F. Peters J. Fleming S. Mullins J.J. Hypertension. 1996; 26: 1126-1131Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Briefly, a cannula made from drawn polyethylene tubing (Portex, Hythe, UK; Product Code 800/100/100) was inserted into the aorta (while the blood flow in the aorta and vena cava was occluded using a suture) and fixed in place using tissue glue. Cannulae were filled with heparin/saline and were flushed daily. Blood pressure was measured 24 h postoperation by connecting the cannula to a pressure transducer (Viggo-Spectralab, Oxnard, CA) and printing on a chart recorder. Statistical significance was assessed using a two-tailed Student's t-test. Animals were sacrificed as above, and blood sampled immediately by cardiac puncture into 0.1 volumes of 125 mm EDTA, 25 mmΩ-phenanthroline. Plasma was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen in 100-μl aliquots. Plasma renin concentrations (PRC) and plasma prorenin concentrations (PPC) were calculated according to the method of Peters et al. (14Peters J. Münter K. Bader M. Hackenthal E. Mullins J.J. Ganten D. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 742-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Total renin concentration was measured by activating 20 μl of plasma with 40 μl of trypsin (400 units/ml, dissolved in TES buffer; 0.1 m TES, pH 7.2, 0.01% neomycin, 10 mm EDTA). Samples were incubated on ice for 10 min and trypsin activation stopped by the addition of 40 μl of soybean trypsin inhibitor (600 units/ml, in TES buffer). Plasma active renin was measured by the addition of 80 μl of TES buffer (without trypsin) to 20 μl of plasma. Pretreated samples were incubated with lyophilized renin substrate, isolated from nephrectomized rat plasma (final concentration; 80 mg/ml, 0.11% 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanol, 1.15 mg/ml 8-hydroxyquinoline in TES buffer). Reactions proceeded for 1–3 h at 37 °C and were stopped with radioimmunoassay buffer (0.1m Tris acetate, pH 7.4). The AngI generated by the plasma renin was measured by radioimmunoassay (15Hermann K. Ganten D. Unger T. Bayer C. Lang R.E. Clin. Chem. 1988; 34: 1046-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 16Schelling P. Ganten U. Sponer G. Unger T. Ganten D. Neuroendocrinology. 1980; 31: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Plasma prorenin concentration is determined as the difference between total renin concentration and plasma active renin concentration. Statistical significance was assessed using the Wilcoxon rank test. Initially, conditions were established for the efficient PCR amplification of DNA fragments in the size range 3–4 kb, using the thermostable proofreading UlTma DNA polymerase (described under “Experimental Procedures”). Subsequently, two regions of theRen-1 d gene, extending from exon 1 to exon 3 and exon 4 to exon 9 (Fig. 1, A andB), were successfully amplified usingRen-1 d-specific primers, from bacteriophage P1 clone P1–1249, which contains the entire mouse 129 Ren-1 d gene. PCR products were then digested and used to assemble the final targeting vector, pR1neoKO, in which 3.5- and 3.7-kb segments of Ren-1 d gene homology flank the selectable marker (Fig. 1 C). Following electroporation of the targeting construct into ES cells, Southern analysis using 5′ and 3′ external probes (Fig. 1 D and not shown) identified 3 from 313 (1%) drug-resistant colonies that were correctly recombined in both the 5′ and 3′ arms. One clone was used to generate male chimeras, which were crossed with strain 129 females to generate inbred 129 heterozygote offspring. These mice were intercrossed to produce an F2 generation with wild-type, heterozygote and homozygote inbredRen-1 d −/− mice (Fig. 1 E). The absence of recombination within the Ren-2 gene demonstrates the previously reported (17Miller C.C.J. McPheat J.C. Potts W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5020-5024Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) highly specific recombination achievable, even when targeting closely related genes. Amplification of total kidney RNA from Ren-1 d −/− mice by reverse transcription-PCR, followed by restriction digestion of the product with EarI, confirmed that the disruptedRen-1 d gene is unable to produce functionalRen-1 d mRNA and that Ren-2 mRNA is the only gene product present in these mice (Fig. 2). Primer extension analysis 3M. G. F. Sharp and A. F. Clark, unpublished work. showed thatRen-2-derived mRNA is 2.8 ± 0.05- and 3.9 ± 0.23-fold more abundant in the kidneys ofRen-1 d −/− males and females, respectively, compared with wild-type mice. Plasma renin concentration (PRC) and plasma prorenin concentration (PPC) were determined from mouse plasma samples (Fig. 3). PRC levels did not differ significantly between males of all three genotypes (+/+ = 240 ± 58; +/− = 170 ± 34; −/− = 243 ± 63 ng of AngI/ml/h;p > 0.05) (Fig. 3 A, solid bars). However, PPC was significantly higher inRen-1 d −/− male mice (1341 ± 116 ng AngI/ml/h), as compared with both wild-type (717 ± 64 ng AngI/ml/h; p < 0.0003) and heterozygous males (566 ± 33 ng AngI/ml/h; p < 0.0003) (Fig.3 A, open bars). In females, PRC was reduced inRen-1 d −/− mice (123 ± 28 ng AngI/ml/h) compared with controls (229 ± 32 ng AngI/ml/h;p < 0.027), while heterozygous females had an intermediate level (164 ± 34 ng AngI/ml/h) (Fig. 3 B, solid bars). Similar to male mice, PPC measurements revealed a significant increase in circulating prorenin in femaleRen-1 d −/− homozygotes (1632 ± 238 ng AngI/ml/h) compared with Ren-1 d+/− mice (528 ± 42 ng AngI/ml/h; p < 0.0003) and wild-type females (557 ± 56 ng AngI/ml/h; p < 0.0003) (Fig. 3 B, open bars). Measurement of mean arterial blood pressures in males showed no significant (p > 0.05) difference between Ren-1 d genotypes (TableI). However, a significant decrease in blood pressure of 12.7 mmHg was seen inRen-1 d −/− females compared with wild-type controls (p < 0.01).Table IResting blood pressure in Ren-1d gene knockout miceMean arterial blood pressure+/++/−−/−mmHgMales93.6 ± 5.2 (8)93.0 ± 4.9 (11)92.3 ± 3.8 (8)Females93.6 ± 2.5 (8)85.6 ± 2.8 (7)80.9 ± 3.4 (8)1-ap < 0.01 by Student's ttest compared with +/+ females.Blood pressure was determined in conscious, restrained wild-type (+/+),Ren-1 d heterozygous (+/−) andRen-1 d homozygous (−/−) mice by direct cannulation of the aorta as described (10Sharp M.G.F.

Kidneys, adrenal glands, submandibular gland, and testes or ovaries fromRen-1 d −/− (n = 4),Ren-1 d +/− (n = 4), and wild-type animals (n = 2) from both sexes were studied. No differences were observed in adrenal glands, submandibular glands, testes, or ovaries from all three genotypes in both sexes. However, kidney sections showed two significant abnormalities in bothRen-1 d −/− males and females (Fig.4, A and B). The macula densa ofRen-1 d −/− mice exhibited hypercellularity, and an altered epithelial morphology in which the cells showed a columnar appearance, which contrasts with the cuboidal morphology of the wild-type controls. The central three macula densa cells were measured in five JG regions from each of four individual mice (n = 20) of each genotype. Wild-type andRen-1 d +/− mice had macula densa cells of 6.1 μm (range 5.6–6.3 μm) and 6.0 μm (range 5.8–6.2 μm) in height (basolateral to apical dimension), respectively, whereas the height of macula densa cells inRen-1 d −/− mice was 7.9 μm (range 7.6–8.1 μm). This represents a 30% increase in cell height in theRen-1 d-deficient mice. Immunostaining of kidney sections with an antibody specific for renin showed that, in contrast to the granular appearance of the controls,Ren-1 d −/− mice exhibited diffuse, uniform, low level cytoplasmic renin staining (approximately 5% of controls) consistent with constitutive secretion, and indicating that renin-2 is not stored in large quantities in the JG cells of these mice (Fig. 4, C and D). Kidney sections from homozygous mutant and control mice were examined by transmission electron microscopy, which demonstrated that the JG cells of theRen-1 d −/− mice were completely devoid of the storage/secretory granules typically present in wild-type controls (Fig. 4, E and F). Nevertheless,Ren-1 d −/− JG cells contain an abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 4 F). Disruption of the Ren-1 d gene, described here, provides the first demonstration that inactivation of a gene encoding renin affects blood pressure homeostasis, exemplified by the sexually dimorphic hypotension seen inRen-1 d −/− females. In addition, theRen-1 d phenotype displays a decrease in the plasma concentration of active renin and an increase in plasma prorenin. Furthermore, a discrete and reproducible change was observed in the morphology of the macula densa cells of the kidney distal tubular epithelium. This small group of cells, which act as sensors in the tubular glomerular feedback loop, but do not express renin, show a 30% increase in basolateral to apical height. The physiological sequelae of this cellular change are presently unknown. Most striking is the complete absence of secretory/storage granules in the JG (modified smooth muscle) cells of the renal afferent arteriole. Thus, expression of the renin-1 d protein is a prerequisite for secretory granule formation and maturation, and the Ren-2 gene product is unable to act as substitute in this role. A novel feature of the current study is the successful inactivation of the Ren-1 d gene by homologous recombination using a targeting construct in which the regions of DNA providingRen-1d gene homology were generated by long range PCR. Together with the use of a similar strategy to target theRen-2 gene (10Sharp M.G.F. Fettes D. Brooker G. Clark A.F. Peters J. Fleming S. Mullins J.J. Hypertension. 1996; 26: 1126-1131Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar), these data demonstrate the feasibility of using homology regions generated entirely by PCR to target genes of interest. Optimized conditions for the efficient amplification of DNA fragments in the size range of 3–4 kb, using a cloned genomic DNA template and the thermostable proofreading UlTma DNA polymerase, included long (6.5 min) extension times, an increased number of cycles (40) and primers of 28–32 nucleotides in length. To facilitate molecular manipulations and/or screening for homologous recombinants, restriction enzyme recognition sequences can be usefully built into primers, but they should be situated at least five nucleotides from the end of the PCR product to permit efficient digestion. Although this experiment utilized a 130-kb bacteriophage P1Ren-1 d genomic clone as the template for PCR, we have also demonstrated the efficient amplification of up to 10 kb fragments from genomic DNA, using a mixture of proofreading andTaq DNA polymerases (Expand kit (Boehringer Mannheim); data not shown). Thus, in principle, the regions of homology required to target any gene can be generated and tailored by direct PCR from genomic DNA. Juxtaglomerular cells, the principal site of renin synthesis, represent a specialized population of the smooth muscle cells of the renal afferent arteriole. In particular they contain abundant modified lysosomal granules, where prorenin is activated and stored (1Taugner, R., and Hackenthal, E. (eds) (1989) The Juxtaglomerular Apparatus: Structure and Function, Springer-Verlag, BerlinGoogle Scholar). It is thought that the release of active renin from these secretory/storage granules is by regulated exocytosis in response to specific physiological stimuli, whereas an additional distinct secretory pathway mediates the constitutive secretion of inactive prorenin, via clear secretory vesicles. This concept is based on previous work on cultured tumoral JG cells and human kidney slices (18Pratt R.E. Carleton J.E. Richie J.P. Heusser C. Dzau V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7837-7840Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and AtT-20 cells, a mouse pituitary cell line that expresses both regulated and constitutive secretory pathways, and can process prorenin into active renin (19Fritz L.C. Haidar M.A. Arfsten A.E. Schilling J.W. Carilli C. Shine J. Baxter J.D. Reudelhuber T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12409-12412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Pratt R.E. Flynn J.A.

It has also been suggested that the mouse enzymes renin-1 d and renin-2 can each be sorted through distinct secretory pathways in AtT-20 cells (23Pratt R.E. Carleton J.E. Roth T.P. Dzau V.J. Endocrinology. 1988; 123: 1721-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 24Ladenheim R.G. Seidah N.G. Rougeon F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 535-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), but whether renin-1 d and renin-2 are secreted separately via distinct pathways or coordinately through both pathways in vivo has yet to be determined. In the current study, the most striking consequences of ablating expression of the renin-1 d protein are a change in renin immunostaining from a punctate, abundant granular pattern in JG cells of wild-type mice, to diffuse, weak cytoplasmic staining (Fig. 4, C and D) and a complete lack of dense granule formation in Ren-1 d-null mice (Fig. 4,E and F). Thus signals required for sorting renin to the regulated secretory pathway of mouse JG cells in vivoreside exclusively in the renin-1 d protein and not in renin-2. This finding suggests that the trafficking and maturation of renin-2 protein within secretory granules in transfected AtT-20 cells (24Ladenheim R.G. Seidah N.G. Rougeon F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 535-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 25Nagahama M. Nakayama K. Murakami K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) may not mirror the situation in the intact mouse, especially given that this cell line displays a different range of prorenin processing activities compared with the JG cells of the kidney (see Ref. 26Villard E. Lalau J.-D. van Hooft I.S. Derkx F.H.M. Houot A.-M. Pinet F. Corvol P. Soubier F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30307-30312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reduced plasma concentrations of active renin and elevated prorenin seen in Ren-1 d −/− mice (Fig. 3) are the converse of the situation in Ren-2 −/− mice (10Sharp M.G.F. Fettes D. Brooker G. Clark A.F. Peters J. Fleming S. Mullins J.J. Hypertension. 1996; 26: 1126-1131Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar), The Ren-1 d −/− phenotype might be explained by a compensatory stimulation of the constitutive secretory pathway, in the absence of regulated secretion of renin-1 d, leading to enhanced secretion of renin-2 in the inactive form. This supports the idea that renin-1 d secretion is predominantly via the regulated (granular) pathway and that renin-2 secretion is predominantly through the constitutive pathway. Higher rates of prorenin-2 secretion may be signaled by the deficit of active renin in the plasma, by the lack of JG secretory/storage granules, or directly by the absence of renin-1 d protein. The exact means by which one or other of these mechanisms stimulates Ren-2 gene expression (2.8–3.9-fold) is not yet clear. However, this resembles a case of human familial elevated plasma prorenin (26Villard E. Lalau J.-D. van Hooft I.S. Derkx F.H.M. Houot A.-M. Pinet F. Corvol P. Soubier F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30307-30312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), where a mutation in exon 10 of one allele of the human renin gene introduces a premature termination codon. The elevated levels of plasma prorenin in this phenotype are postulated to result from a compensatory mechanism that enhances expression from the normal renin allele (26Villard E. Lalau J.-D. van Hooft I.S. Derkx F.H.M. Houot A.-M. Pinet F. Corvol P. Soubier F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30307-30312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The data in Fig.3 clearly show that homozygous Ren-1 d-null mice display reduced, but nonetheless detectable, levels of active renin in the plasma. This active renin must be derived exclusively from the product of the Ren-2 gene, although the means by which prorenin-2 is converted to activate renin-2 is presently not clear. The complete absence of storage/secretory granules inRen-1 d −/− JG cells, the normal site of renin maturation activity, raises the possibility that prorenin-2 is activated in an extrarenal site in these mice. The hypotension observed in femaleRen-1 d −/− mice demonstrates that the renin-2 protein cannot accomplish all the functions of renin-1 d in maintaining basal blood pressure. The fact that reduced blood pressure is seen only in female mice might well be a consequence of the sexually dimorphic expression of the Ren-2 gene (8Sigmund C.D. Gross K.W. Hypertension. 1991; 18: 446-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). For example, male mice express much higher levels of renin-2 in the SMG than females, and this may compensate for a reduction in active renin concentration (Fig. 3) and the hypotension otherwise conferred by theRen-1 d mutation. The altered macula densa cell morphology (Fig. 4) might reflect perturbations in the renin-angiotensin system in Ren-1 d −/−mice, leading in turn to changes in chloride and fluid balance and altered signaling via the tubuloglomerular feedback loop. Studies of ion and fluid balance in Ren-1 d −/−mice are presently underway to address these questions. Recent gene-targeting experiments have shown that an intact renin-angiotensin system is fundamental to maintaining basal blood pressure, since mice lacking genes for angiotensinogen (Agt(27Tanimoto K.

It is notable that while Ren-1 d −/− mice also have altered renal morphology, these changes are much less severe, and more specific, than those seen in Agt and ACEknockout mice. A critical feature of the present study is that all mouse stocks were maintained on the 129 strain inbred genetic background onto which the original Ren-1 d − gene mutation was introduced. This eliminates the risk of introducing modifier loci, inherent in cross-breeding to other genetic strains, which may mask any phenotypic change caused solely by the introduced mutation (33Lathe R. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 183-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Strategies to account for modifier gene effects in gene targeting experiments exist (34Smithies O. Maeda N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5266-5272Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), but these involve large breeding populations to ensure random segregation of loci, coupled with genotype assessment. Importantly, the maintenance of a pure genetic background also permits direct comparison with different knock-out animals on the same 129 strain background, for example, Ren-2 −/− (10Sharp M.G.F. Fettes D. Brooker G. Clark A.F. Peters J. Fleming S. Mullins J.J. Hypertension. 1996; 26: 1126-1131Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and Ren-1 d /Ren-2 −/−animals. 4M. G. F. Sharp, A. F. Clark, D. F. Fettes, and J. J. Mullins, unpublished data. In conclusion, these studies demonstrate that the mouseRen-1 d and Ren-2 gene products fulfil distinct roles in renin secretory granule formation and blood pressure homeostasis and that the renin gene duplication in some strains of mice is not functionally redundant. The availability of bothRen-1 d −/− (this study) andRen-2 −/− (10Sharp M.G.F. Fettes D. Brooker G. Clark A.F. Peters J. Fleming S. Mullins J.J. Hypertension. 1996; 26: 1126-1131Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar) mice presents additional opportunities to dissect renin gene function and the mechanisms underlying the trafficking, storage, maturation, and release of reninin vivo. Furthermore,Ren-1 d −/− mice are likely to be especially useful in addressing the contribution of macula densa signaling in the tubuloglomerular feedback loop, particularly in response to perturbations in the renin-angiotensin system.

Decorin, a small dermatan sulfate proteoglycan, is a ubiquitous component of extracellular matrices (see Refs. 1Iozzo R.V. Murdoch A.D.

It had also been shown that independently of its complex formation with transforming growth factor-β it counteracts the malignant phenotype at least of colon carcinoma cells (13Santra M. Skorski T.

Chem. 1996; 271: 18961-18965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar).Most studies on the interaction of decorin with extracellular matrix components concern the binding to type I collagen, although other collagens like type II, III, and VI as well as complement C1q have also been shown to interact with decorin (15Bidanset D.J.

Evidence has been provided that triple helical type I collagen possesses a specific decorin core protein binding site at the d-band in each D-period (4Pringle G.A. Dodd C.M. J. Histochem.

Chem. 1993; 268: 27307-27312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As decorin binds to the surface of collagen fibrils, the lateral assembly of individual triple helical collagen molecules is delayed (19Rosenberg L. Tang L.H. Choi H.U. Johnson T. Scott J.E. Dermatan Sulphate Proteoglycans. Portland Press, London1993: 225-239Google Scholar, 20Vogel K.G. Paulsson M. Heinegård D. Biochem. J. 1984; 223: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar), and the diameter of the fibrils is decreased (21Vogel K.G. Trotter J.A. Collagen Relat. Res. 1987; 7: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). That these interactions are also important in vivo can unambiguously be deduced from the phenotype of mice lacking the decorin gene (22Danielson K.G. Baribault H. Holmes D.F. Graham H. Kadler K.E. Iozzo R.V. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 729-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar). These animals are characterized by fragile skin, and their collagen fibrils have an uneven diameter due to uncontrolled lateral fusion.There is direct and indirect evidence that collagen-bound decorin is still able to interact with transforming growth factor-β (23Hausser H. Gröning A. Hasilik A. Schönherr E. Kresse H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 243-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and decorin may even mediate an attachment of type VI collagen to banded collagen fibrils (24Keene D.R. Kuo H.-J. Glanville R.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7 (abstr.): 411Google Scholar). In light of the multitude of potential binding partners of decorin, it would therefore be useful to identify the binding sites for these molecules along the core protein. This would allow an understanding of the assembly of decorin-containing extracellular matrices and of the consequences of a partial proteolytic breakdown of decorin as it happens, for example, in rheumatoid arthritis (25Witsch-Prehm P. Miehlke R. Kresse H. Arthritis Rheum. 1992; 35: 1042-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Decorin belongs to a widely distributed family of proteins that are characterized by about 12 consecutively arranged leucine-rich repeat structures (26Day A.A. Ramis C.I. Fisher L.W. Gehron Robey P. Termine J.D. Young M.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 9861-9876Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 27Krusius T. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7683-7687Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), which together form a short β-strand followed by an α-helix. The tertiary structure of one of these proteins has been elucidated by x-ray crystallography at 2.5 Å resolution. The essential features of the molecule are a horseshoe-like structure where the β-sheets form the inner concave surface and the α-helices make up the outer convex face (28Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1993; 366: 751-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). X-ray studies of the complex of ribonuclease inhibitor and its ligand, ribonuclease, indicated that the ligand was in contact with opposing sites of the horseshoe (29Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1995; 374: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar) and gave evidence for the conformational flexibility of the leucine-rich repeat structure.Recently, the re-evaluation of rotary shadowing electron micrographs of a mixture of decorin and of a further proteoglycan made up of leucine-rich repeats, fibromodulin, suggested that decorin, too, is horseshoe-shaped (30Scott J.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8795-8799Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). From the results of molecular modeling, it was concluded that the inner concave surface of decorin is of suitable size to accommodate a single triple helix. The possibility of a secondary site located near the C terminus was also considered (31Weber I.T. Harrison R.W. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31767-31770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Studies performed before on chimeric decorin/biglycan proteins had indicated that a major binding site for type I collagen is located within the two repeats Leu152–Lys201 (32Svensson L. Heinegård D. Oldberg Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20712-20716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Similar conclusions were drawn from own studies employing recombinant decorin peptides (33Schönherr E. Hausser H. Beavan L. Kresse H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8877-8883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The data also suggested the presence of a second, less active binding site in the C-terminal half of the core protein. Similarly, in a preliminary report it was concluded that decorin contains at least two functional domains that are involved in the interaction with the collagen-like molecule C1q (34Spiro R.C. Countaway J.L. Gaarde W.A. Garcia J.A. Leisten J. O'Neill J.J. Smiley W.R. Stecker K. Harper J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5 (abstr.): 303Google Scholar). On theoretical grounds Scott (30Scott J.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8795-8799Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) proposed the sequences Lys130–Arg133 and Arg272–His275 as binding sites for collagen.In the present study we describe the type I collagen binding properties of several mutant decorin molecules expressed in and secreted by eukaryotic cells. The results indicate the importance of Met176–Lys201, i.e. of the sixth leucine-rich repeat, for collagen binding and indicate a critical role of glutamate 180.DISCUSSIONThe results of this study provide a further example of the possibility of producing recombinant decorin beingN-glycosylated and linked with a chondroitin/dermatan sulfate chain (13Santra M.

Taking into account the horseshoe model of the tertiary structure of decorin and the proposal that collagen triple helices are in contact with the inner concave surface of the proteoglycan (31Weber I.T.

The homologous proteoglycan, biglycan, has been shown to interact with type I collagen, too, although the dissociation constants obtained from Scatchard plots were higher for glycanated biglycan than for glycanated decorin (40Schönherr E.

The sixth leucine-rich repeat of biglycan is homologous with the sixth repeat of decorin, and there is, as in decorin, a glutamate residue at the fifth position of this repeat (46Fisher L.W.

Thus, the different affinities of decorin and biglycan for type I collagen are unlikely to result from structural differences within this single repeat. It had been observed, however, that glycosaminoglycan-free biglycan exhibited a much higher affinity for reconstituted collagen fibrils than the glycanated species (40Schönherr E. Witsch-Prehm P.

Different CD spectra for decorin purified under denaturing conditions and native decorin had been reported recently (43Ramamurthy P. Hocking A.M. McQuillan D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19578-19584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In the horseshoe model of decorin the carboxylate group of glutamate 180 is oriented toward the water face at the inner concavity, and it seems likely that also in this case the overall structure of the core protein is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions between the adjacent β-sheets and by interactions between the α-helices at the outer convex surface (31Weber I.T.

It is assumed that decorin inhibits the lateral association of collagen monomers into oligomers, and during the early phases of fibril formation a 1:1 stoichiometry between the two macromolecules may be assumed (19Rosenberg L. Tang L.H. Choi H.U. Johnson T. Scott J.E. Dermatan Sulphate Proteoglycans. Portland Press, London1993: 225-239Google Scholar). When collagen fibrils grow laterally this molar ratio changes, and there is less than one proteoglycan per D-period of the fibril (47Scott J.E. Scott J.E. Dermatan Sulphate Proteoglycans. Portland Press, London1993: 165-181Google Scholar). Reconstituted collagen fibrils as used in the present study bind maximally one decorin per 20 monomers (48Brown D.C. Vogel K.G. Matrix. 1989; 9: 468-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that during fibrillogenesis in vivo there is a continuous association and dissociation of decorin, whereas in the in vitro assays the collagen molecules at the surface of the fibril can stably bind the proteoglycan. Whether or not the binding sites and the binding properties are fully identical during these different stages of interactions remains to be investigated.The interpretation of the data of binding studies between type I collagen and decorin is further complicated by the proposal made on experimental and theoretical grounds (31Weber I.T.

Some of the relevant data for N-terminal regions with sequence homology are given in Fig. 7. With respect to the reference sequence only the position of basic amino acid residues was fully conserved. This could indicate that the same site in decorin core protein interacts with the different collagens and C1q, respectively, and it also implicates the importance of acidic residues for collagen binding. From the results of the present study, glutamate 180 should be considered as such a critical residue.A second collagen binding site has been located in the C-terminal portion of decorin (31Weber I.T.

Chem. 1995; 270: 8877-8883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The structural prerequisites for this interaction are not yet known. Studies to address this problem would best be done in dynamic fibrillogenesis assays and may require the creation of additional decorin constructs. Decorin, a small dermatan sulfate proteoglycan, is a ubiquitous component of extracellular matrices (see Refs. 1Iozzo R.V. Murdoch A.D.

It is found preferentially in association with collagen fibrils (3Fleischmajer R. Fisher L.W. MacDonald E.D. Jacobs Jr., L. Perlish J.S. Termine J.D. J. Struct.

Nature. 1990; 346: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar), and (iii) a receptor required for its endocytosis (12Hausser H. Hoppe W. Rauch U. Kresse H. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It had also been shown that independently of its complex formation with transforming growth factor-β it counteracts the malignant phenotype at least of colon carcinoma cells (13Santra M. Skorski T. Calabretta B. Lattime E.C. Iozzo R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 18961-18965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Most studies on the interaction of decorin with extracellular matrix components concern the binding to type I collagen, although other collagens like type II, III, and VI as well as complement C1q have also been shown to interact with decorin (15Bidanset D.J. Guidry C. Rosenberg L.C. Choi H.U. Timpl R. Hook M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5250-5256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Krumdieck R. Höök M. Rosenberg L. Volanakis J.E. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 3695-3701PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence has been provided that triple helical type I collagen possesses a specific decorin core protein binding site at the d-band in each D-period (4Pringle G.A. Dodd C.M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1990; 38: 1405-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 5Scott J.E. Biochem. J. 1988; 252: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar,17Uldbjerg N. Danielsen C.C. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and that some additional interactions may be mediated by the dermatan sulfate chain (18Hedbom E. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27307-27312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As decorin binds to the surface of collagen fibrils, the lateral assembly of individual triple helical collagen molecules is delayed (19Rosenberg L. Tang L.H. Choi H.U. Johnson T. Scott J.E. Dermatan Sulphate Proteoglycans. Portland Press, London1993: 225-239Google Scholar, 20Vogel K.G. Paulsson M. Heinegård D. Biochem. J. 1984; 223: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar), and the diameter of the fibrils is decreased (21Vogel K.G. Trotter J.A. Collagen Relat. Res. 1987; 7: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). That these interactions are also important in vivo can unambiguously be deduced from the phenotype of mice lacking the decorin gene (22Danielson K.G. Baribault H. Holmes D.F. Graham H. Kadler K.E. Iozzo R.V. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 729-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar). These animals are characterized by fragile skin, and their collagen fibrils have an uneven diameter due to uncontrolled lateral fusion. There is direct and indirect evidence that collagen-bound decorin is still able to interact with transforming growth factor-β (23Hausser H. Gröning A. Hasilik A. Schönherr E. Kresse H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 243-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and decorin may even mediate an attachment of type VI collagen to banded collagen fibrils (24Keene D.R. Kuo H.-J. Glanville R.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7 (abstr.): 411Google Scholar). In light of the multitude of potential binding partners of decorin, it would therefore be useful to identify the binding sites for these molecules along the core protein. This would allow an understanding of the assembly of decorin-containing extracellular matrices and of the consequences of a partial proteolytic breakdown of decorin as it happens, for example, in rheumatoid arthritis (25Witsch-Prehm P. Miehlke R. Kresse H. Arthritis Rheum. 1992; 35: 1042-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Decorin belongs to a widely distributed family of proteins that are characterized by about 12 consecutively arranged leucine-rich repeat structures (26Day A.A. Ramis C.I. Fisher L.W. Gehron Robey P. Termine J.D. Young M.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 9861-9876Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 27Krusius T. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7683-7687Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), which together form a short β-strand followed by an α-helix. The tertiary structure of one of these proteins has been elucidated by x-ray crystallography at 2.5 Å resolution. The essential features of the molecule are a horseshoe-like structure where the β-sheets form the inner concave surface and the α-helices make up the outer convex face (28Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1993; 366: 751-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). X-ray studies of the complex of ribonuclease inhibitor and its ligand, ribonuclease, indicated that the ligand was in contact with opposing sites of the horseshoe (29Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1995; 374: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar) and gave evidence for the conformational flexibility of the leucine-rich repeat structure. Recently, the re-evaluation of rotary shadowing electron micrographs of a mixture of decorin and of a further proteoglycan made up of leucine-rich repeats, fibromodulin, suggested that decorin, too, is horseshoe-shaped (30Scott J.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8795-8799Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). From the results of molecular modeling, it was concluded that the inner concave surface of decorin is of suitable size to accommodate a single triple helix. The possibility of a secondary site located near the C terminus was also considered (31Weber I.T. Harrison R.W. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31767-31770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Studies performed before on chimeric decorin/biglycan proteins had indicated that a major binding site for type I collagen is located within the two repeats Leu152–Lys201 (32Svensson L. Heinegård D. Oldberg Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20712-20716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Similar conclusions were drawn from own studies employing recombinant decorin peptides (33Schönherr E. Hausser H. Beavan L. Kresse H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8877-8883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The data also suggested the presence of a second, less active binding site in the C-terminal half of the core protein. Similarly, in a preliminary report it was concluded that decorin contains at least two functional domains that are involved in the interaction with the collagen-like molecule C1q (34Spiro R.C. Countaway J.L. Gaarde W.A. Garcia J.A. Leisten J. O'Neill J.J. Smiley W.R. Stecker K. Harper J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5 (abstr.): 303Google Scholar). On theoretical grounds Scott (30Scott J.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8795-8799Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) proposed the sequences Lys130–Arg133 and Arg272–His275 as binding sites for collagen. In the present study we describe the type I collagen binding properties of several mutant decorin molecules expressed in and secreted by eukaryotic cells. The results indicate the importance of Met176–Lys201, i.e. of the sixth leucine-rich repeat, for collagen binding and indicate a critical role of glutamate 180. DISCUSSIONThe results of this study provide a further example of the possibility of producing recombinant decorin beingN-glycosylated and linked with a chondroitin/dermatan sulfate chain (13Santra M.

This could indicate that the same site in decorin core protein interacts with the different collagens and C1q, respectively, and it also implicates the importance of acidic residues for collagen binding. From the results of the present study, glutamate 180 should be considered as such a critical residue.A second collagen binding site has been located in the C-terminal portion of decorin (31Weber I.T.

Studies to address this problem would best be done in dynamic fibrillogenesis assays and may require the creation of additional decorin constructs. The results of this study provide a further example of the possibility of producing recombinant decorin beingN-glycosylated and linked with a chondroitin/dermatan sulfate chain (13Santra M.

For the first time, however, deletions of individual leucine-rich repeats, point mutations, and truncation of C-terminal sequences were introduced. The main result of the present study was the observation that the sixth leucine-rich repeat Met176–Lys201 and specifically glutamate 180 within this repeat are of special importance for the interaction with reconstituted type I collagen fibrils. The deletion of just any whole repeat itself is not a necessary condition to interfere with collagen binding because decorin with a deletion of the seventh repeat Leu202–Ser222 exhibited, at most, marginally impaired binding properties. Taking into account the horseshoe model of the tertiary structure of decorin and the proposal that collagen triple helices are in contact with the inner concave surface of the proteoglycan (31Weber I.T. Harrison R.W. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31767-31770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), it seems likely that there is sufficient flexibility within the core protein to compensate for the loss of at least certain single repeat structures. Decorin is not the only chondroitin/dermatan sulfate proteoglycan that binds to fibrillar collagens. The homologous proteoglycan, biglycan, has been shown to interact with type I collagen, too, although the dissociation constants obtained from Scatchard plots were higher for glycanated biglycan than for glycanated decorin (40Schönherr E. Witsch-Prehm P. Harrach B. Robenek H. Rauterberg J. Kresse H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2776-2783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The sixth leucine-rich repeat of biglycan is homologous with the sixth repeat of decorin, and there is, as in decorin, a glutamate residue at the fifth position of this repeat (46Fisher L.W. Termine J.D. Young M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4571-4576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the different affinities of decorin and biglycan for type I collagen are unlikely to result from structural differences within this single repeat. It had been observed, however, that glycosaminoglycan-free biglycan exhibited a much higher affinity for reconstituted collagen fibrils than the glycanated species (40Schönherr E. Witsch-Prehm P. Harrach B. Robenek H. Rauterberg J. Kresse H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2776-2783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), and it is interesting to consider that the different affinities of decorin and biglycan for collagen are a reflection of the different number of glycosaminoglycan chains. Unfortunately, we have not been able to obtain sufficient quantities of pure recombinant proteins under nondenaturing conditions to investigate the tertiary structure by CD spectroscopy. Different CD spectra for decorin purified under denaturing conditions and native decorin had been reported recently (43Ramamurthy P. Hocking A.M. McQuillan D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19578-19584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In the horseshoe model of decorin the carboxylate group of glutamate 180 is oriented toward the water face at the inner concavity, and it seems likely that also in this case the overall structure of the core protein is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions between the adjacent β-sheets and by interactions between the α-helices at the outer convex surface (31Weber I.T. Harrison R.W. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31767-31770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The mechanism of collagen fibril assembly in the absence or the presence of decorin is by no means fully understood. It is assumed that decorin inhibits the lateral association of collagen monomers into oligomers, and during the early phases of fibril formation a 1:1 stoichiometry between the two macromolecules may be assumed (19Rosenberg L. Tang L.H. Choi H.U. Johnson T. Scott J.E. Dermatan Sulphate Proteoglycans. Portland Press, London1993: 225-239Google Scholar). When collagen fibrils grow laterally this molar ratio changes, and there is less than one proteoglycan per D-period of the fibril (47Scott J.E. Scott J.E. Dermatan Sulphate Proteoglycans. Portland Press, London1993: 165-181Google Scholar). Reconstituted collagen fibrils as used in the present study bind maximally one decorin per 20 monomers (48Brown D.C. Vogel K.G. Matrix. 1989; 9: 468-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that during fibrillogenesis in vivo there is a continuous association and dissociation of decorin, whereas in the in vitro assays the collagen molecules at the surface of the fibril can stably bind the proteoglycan. Whether or not the binding sites and the binding properties are fully identical during these different stages of interactions remains to be investigated. The interpretation of the data of binding studies between type I collagen and decorin is further complicated by the proposal made on experimental and theoretical grounds (31Weber I.T. Harrison R.W. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31767-31770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 33Schönherr E. Hausser H. Beavan L. Kresse H. J. Biol.

Molecular modeling of decorin indicated that its concave face could accommodate a single triple helix. The reference sequence174KGEAPEGARGSE186 has been considered to be present at the contact site between both macromolecules (31Weber I.T. Harrison R.W. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol.

Efficient DNA replication requires that the functions of the gene 4 protein be coordinated with the movement of the T7 DNA polymerase. We show that a carboxyl-terminal domain of the gene 4 protein is required for interaction with T7 DNA polymerase during leading strand DNA synthesis. The carboxyl terminus of the gene 4 protein is highly acidic: of the 17 carboxyl-terminal amino acids 7 are negatively charged. Deletion of the coding region for these 17 residues results in a gene 4 protein that cannot support the growth of T7 phage. The purified mutant gene 4 protein has wild-type levels of both helicase and primase activities; however, DNA synthesis catalyzed by T7 DNA polymerase on a duplex DNA substrate is stimulated by this mutant protein to only about 5% of the level of synthesis obtained with wild-type protein. The mutant gene 4 protein can form hexamers and bind single-stranded DNA, but as determined by native PAGE analysis, the protein cannot form a stable complex with the DNA polymerase. The mutant gene 4 protein can prime DNA synthesis normally, indicating that for lagging strand synthesis a different set of helicase/primase-DNA polymerase interactions are involved.

These findings have implications for the mechanisms coupling leading and lagging strand DNA synthesis at the T7 replication fork. The economy of proteins involved in the replication of the linear double-stranded DNA chromosome of bacteriophage T7 has made it an attractive model for dissecting the protein-protein interactions that are essential for coordination of the multiple reactions that occur at a replication fork (1Richardson C.C.

This dramatic effect of a specific protein-protein interaction has led to the identification of a unique 76-residue domain in the T7 gene 5 protein that is responsible for this interaction with its processivity factor (4Bedford E.

The gene 5 protein interacts with the hexameric gene 4 protein that provides both helicase and primase activities at the replication fork (12Nakai H. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15208-15216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In turn, the essential gene 2.5 ssDNA binding protein interacts with both the polymerase and the gene 4 protein, interactions that enhance both polymerase and primase activities (12Nakai H.

Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 157-166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In considering the interactions between these two proteins, it is important to consider the multiple reactions catalyzed by the gene 4 protein. Gene 4 encodes two colinear polypeptides of 56 and 63 kDa. The 56-kDa form is translated from an internal initiation codon that is in-frame with the coding sequence for the 63-kDa protein (15Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 477-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). Both forms of the protein have helicase activity, bind ssDNA in the presence of a nucleoside triphosphate, and translocate 5′ to 3′ along the DNA strand using the energy of nucleoside 5′-triphosphate hydrolysis (15Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 477-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar, 16Kolodner R. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Upon encountering duplex DNA, the gene 4 protein separates the strands processively, provided that there are 6 to 7 unpaired nucleotides on the 3′ strand (19Matson S.W. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14017-14024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The T7 DNA polymerase-thioredoxin complex by itself is unable to synthesize DNA if it encounters double-stranded regions of DNA and so requires the strand separation ability of the helicase to replicate a duplex template (20Lechner R.L. Engler M.J. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11174-11184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,21Lechner R.L. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11185-11196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The 63-kDa gene 4 protein has 63 amino acids at its amino terminus that are not found on the 56-kDa protein, and this domain contains a Cys4 zinc binding motif (22Bernstein J.A.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3909-3916Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The 63-kDa gene 4 protein catalyzes the template-directed synthesis of oligoribonucleotides at specific recognition sites on ssDNA, a reaction that is dependent on the presence of the zinc binding motif (18Tabor S.

T7 DNA polymerase then uses these oligoribonucleotides as primers to initiate synthesis on ssDNA templates. Inasmuch as the 63-kDa gene 4 protein has both helicase and primase activities, it alone is sufficient to support T7 DNA replication and phage growth (27Rosenberg A.H. Patel S.S. Johnson K.A.

A. 1992; 89: 10638-10642Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).The quaternary structure of the active form of the gene 4 protein, with regard to both helicase and primase activities, is a hexamer (29Notarnicola S.M.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12478-12487Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).In vivo the hexamer is most likely composed of both small and large forms of the gene 4 protein (32Notarnicola S.N. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27198-27207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bound ssDNA appears, in electron micrographs, to pass through the center of the ring-shaped gene 4 hexamer (33Egelman E.H. Yu X. Wild R. Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3869-3873Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). It would not be an oversimplification to conclude that this observation most likely explains the requirement that gene 4 protein form a hexamer to bind ssDNA (29Notarnicola S.M. Park K. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20215-20224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Studies using a nucleotide binding site mutant have shown that translocation of the gene 4 protein on ssDNA is inhibited when the hexamer consists of a mixture of wild-type monomers and monomers of the nucleotide binding site mutant gene 4 protein (32Notarnicola S.N. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27198-27207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These latter studies show that the subunits within a hexamer must interact in a coordinated manner to translocate on ssDNA and to function as a helicase and a primase.The potential interactions between the gene 4 protein and T7 DNA polymerase are numerous, as evidenced by the above considerations, and suggest that the gene 4 protein may play a pivotal role in coordinating leading and lagging strand DNA synthesis since it functions in both. First, an interaction of the two proteins would appear essential to coordinate the movement of the polymerase with that of the helicase as it unwinds the duplex during leading strand synthesis. Second, on the lagging strand the primase must stabilize the newly synthesized tetra-ribonucleotides until they are extended by the polymerase (26Scherzinger E. Lanka E. Hillenbrand G.

The ability of the polymerase to use the oligoribonucleotides as primers is dependent on the presence of the gene 4 protein, a requirement that dictates an interaction between the two proteins. Finally, the coupling of leading and lagging strand DNA synthesis at the T7 replication fork (3Debyser Z. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 157-166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) most likely relies on the ability of the gene 4 hexamer to interact with both the leading and lagging strand DNA polymerases.Earlier studies demonstrated an interaction between T7 DNA polymerase and gene 4 protein in the presence and absence of M13 ssDNA (12Nakai H. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15208-15216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Nakai H. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15217-15224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and numerous studies have provided indirect evidence of physical interactions based on the activities of the two proteins (3Debyser Z. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 157-166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 20Lechner R.L. Engler M.J. Richardson C.C. J. Biol.

In this report we show a direct interaction of the T7 DNA polymerase and the gene 4 protein and identify the acidic carboxyl terminus of the gene 4 protein as an essential domain for this interaction. Furthermore, we find that an altered gene 4 protein that cannot interact with T7 DNA polymerase is, nevertheless, capable of catalyzing the unwinding of duplex DNA. At a replication fork the helicase activity of the mutant protein is uncoupled from the polymerization reaction resulting in a cessation of DNA synthesis.DISCUSSIONThe gene 4 protein of bacteriophage T7 provides both helicase and primase functions at the replication fork (16Kolodner R. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 1525-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 21Lechner R.L. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11185-11196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Romano L.J. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10476-10482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Scherzinger E. Lanka E. Morelli G. Seiffert D. Yuki A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 72: 543-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 44Nakai H. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9818-9830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this capacity the gene 4 protein interacts with T7 DNA polymerase on both the leading and lagging strands to unwind the duplex and synthesize primers, respectively. Through these interactions with DNA polymerases on each strand, the gene 4 protein coordinates leading and lagging strand synthesis at the replication fork (3Debyser Z. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 157-166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The dramatic and specific effects of the helicase and primase activities of the gene 4 protein on polymerase activity imply a direct interaction of the two proteins, and such an interaction has been demonstrated (12Nakai H. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15208-15216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results presented in this report confirm this interaction and lead to the identification of the carboxyl terminus of the gene 4 protein as the domain responsible for its interaction with the T7 DNA polymerase during leading strand synthesis.Interestingly, the carboxyl-terminal domain of the T7 gene 4 protein is not essential for any of its multiple enzymatic activities but is absolutely required for its function in vivo. The DNA dependent nucleotide hydrolysis, helicase, and primase activities of the gene 4A-ΔCt protein are essentially identical to those of the wild-type protein. Only when we examined the coupling of polymerase activity on duplex DNA to helicase activity of the gene 4 protein did we detect a defect. In these assays, where DNA synthesis is dependent on the coordinated activities of both proteins, the carboxyl-terminal truncated gene 4 protein is at least 10-fold less effective in stimulating DNA synthesis catalyzed by T7 DNA polymerase than is the wild-type gene 4 protein.To examine the ability of the gene 4 protein to enable T7 DNA polymerase to catalyze synthesis through dsDNA, we used two assays, each employing a distinct DNA template. One template was circular duplex plasmid DNA containing a single site-specific nick. In this instance, it was necessary to use T7 DNA polymerase Δ28, an altered form of the polymerase lacking 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity (46Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4767-4771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar). Only in the absence of exonuclease activity will the polymerase catalyze strand displacement synthesis sufficient to create a single-stranded tail, or lagging strand, to which the gene 4 protein can bind and subsequently translocate to the replication fork where it can presumably form a complex with the paused DNA polymerase (21Lechner R.L. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11185-11196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Coincidentally, this same form of the polymerase was required in the gel-shift assay to prevent the potent exonuclease activity of the wild-type polymerase from hydrolyzing the oligonucleotides present in the reaction mixture. The second DNA synthesis assay used a small circular duplex DNA molecule containing a replication fork (21Lechner R.L. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11185-11196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); therefore, the wild-type T7 DNA polymerase could be used in the reaction.Together T7 DNA polymerase and wild-type gene 4 protein polymerize nucleotides processively on a duplex template at a rate of approximately 300 nucleotides per s at 30 °C (21Lechner R.L. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11185-11196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the ability of the gene 4 protein to function in this reaction is specific for T7 DNA polymerase because other enzymes such as the phage T4 DNA polymerase cannot substitute for T7 polymerase. Our data indicate that processive DNA synthesis depends on the formation and maintenance of a stable complex at the replication fork, and this is provided by the direct interaction of the gene 4 protein and DNA polymerase. This interaction prevents the proteins from outdistancing each other and thus losing their combined effectiveness. For example if the helicase out-paced the polymerase so that a duplex region formed between the two proteins, DNA synthesis would halt since the polymerase alone cannot catalyze strand displacement synthesis through even a single base pair (21Lechner R.L. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11185-11196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Alternative scenarios relying on uniform rates of movement of the enzymes along the DNA are, of course, conceivable. These situations would not rely on direct physical interactions to maintain a replication complex. For example, it is possible that the rate of nucleotide polymerization is faster than that of helicase unwinding. This would prevent a functional separation of the two proteins since a helicase moving ahead of the polymerase would be the rate-limiting step. Likewise, in a model where the polymerase is positioned in front of the helicase the inability of the polymerase to catalyze strand displacement synthesis would keep it in close proximity to the helicase. Neither model, however, can account for our results since polymerase activity would be expected to remain the same with either the wild-type or mutant gene 4 protein. Our finding that the gene 4A-ΔCt protein is severely defective in stimulating T7 DNA polymerase, in two different synthesis assays, even though it has normal helicase activity suggests strongly that coordination of the two proteins is lacking. The results, in fact, indicate that the coordination normally occurs through a protein-protein interaction to form a functional complex.It is clear that the T7 DNA polymerase and the gene 4 protein form a complex. This interaction was shown indirectly in earlier studies (12Nakai H. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15208-15216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is demonstrated directly in the gel-shift experiments and plasmon resonance measurements presented in this study. Furthermore, both these latter experiments demonstrate that the carboxyl-terminal truncated gene 4 protein is defective in its ability to form a complex with T7 DNA polymerase. In the gel shift assay the polymerase remains bound to the gene 4 protein through the preincubation period and subsequent gel electrophoresis, a total period of more than 2 h. In the plasmon resonance analysis the binding of DNA polymerase to the gene 4 hexamer-ssDNA complex was so tight that an off-rate could not be determined within the time course of the experiment. Formation of the gene 4 protein-DNA polymerase complex, however, is not dependent on the presence of ssDNA. Gel-shift experiments performed without oligonucleotide resulted in the formation of the same DNA polymerase-wild-type gene 4 protein complex as detected by silver staining of the gels (data not shown). This result was expected since, as shown in Fig. 6 (lane 3), T7 DNA polymerase does not bind ssDNA under the conditions used. Moreover, it is likely that the entire 26-base oligonucleotide is bound within the hexameric gene 4 protein (30Patel S.S. Hingorani M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10668-10675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12478-12487Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).The ability of the gene 4 proteins to form hexamers and bind ssDNA was also demonstrated by the gel-shift assay. In the presence of β,γ-methylene dTTP both wild-type and the gene 4A-ΔCt protein bind the radiolabeled oligonucleotide (Fig. 6, lanes 1 and5). Since the gene 4 protein must form a hexamer to bind ssDNA (29Notarnicola S.M. Park K. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20215-20224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 31Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12478-12487Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), it is clear that hexamer formation was not affected by the carboxyl-terminal deletion. Furthermore, both proteins bound ssDNA with a stoichiometry of approximately 1 mol of ssDNA per mol of gene 4 hexamer, indicating that DNA binding is not affected by the deletion mutation.Not only is an interaction of the gene 4 protein and DNA polymerase required for strand displacement DNA synthesis, it is also required for priming DNA synthesis on the lagging strand of the replication fork. The gene 4A protein catalyzes the synthesis of tetra-ribonucleotides at specific sequences on ssDNA in a template-mediated reaction. These tetra-ribonucleotides are stabilized on the template by the gene 4A protein until T7 DNA polymerase can use them as primers to initiate DNA synthesis (36Nakai H. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15217-15224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such short oligoribonucleotides prime T7 DNA polymerase extremely poorly in the absence of the gene 4 protein (26Scherzinger E. Lanka E. Hillenbrand G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1977; 4: 4151-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). 2T. Kusakabe and C. C. Richardson, unpublished observations. The effective use of these tetra-ribonucleotides by T7 DNA polymerase in the presence of the gene 4 protein implies that a specific protein-protein interaction is required and, in fact, T7 gene 4 protein cannot provide functional primers to bacteriophage T4 DNA polymerase.2 The finding that wild-type and gene 4A-ΔCt protein provide essentially identical levels of priming on M13 ssDNA (Fig. 3 B) suggests the existence of a second domain of the gene 4 protein that mediates interactions with DNA polymerase during this reaction. Alternatively, a more transient interaction may occur between the DNA polymerase and the carboxyl terminus of the gene 4A helicase/primase during the priming reaction. This transient or weaker priming interaction may be only slightly, or not at all, affected by the carboxyl-terminal deletion.No T7 phage suppressors of this gene 4 deletion mutation were detected in the complementation assays (Table I), a result that is most likely due to the severe nature of the deletion mutation. Site-directed mutagenesis of individual residues within this 17-amino acid carboxyl-terminal domain of the helicase/primase could be used to determine the specific residues involved in the interaction with T7 DNA polymerase. These mutant gene 4 proteins could then be used to detect suppressor mutations in the T7 DNA polymerase and thus identify the domain of the polymerase responsible for interactions with the helicase/primase. It is possible that alone no single residue of this region plays an essential role in the interaction with T7 DNA polymerase, rather that the region as a whole is required. In this regard, it is interesting to note that Rosenberg et al. (47Rosenberg A.H. Griffin K. Washington M.T. Patel S.S. Studier F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26819-26824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) in a random mutagenesis of gene 4 failed to identify essential residues in this carboxyl-terminal region. They did, however, select a gene 4 mutant, Q507(Ochre), containing a termination codon positioned so that the last 60 residues of the protein were deleted. This mutant could not support the growth of a gene 4-deleted T7 phage. While this 60-amino acid deletion is more severe than the 17-residue deletion mutant studied in this report, it is likely that their mutant gene 4 protein was also defective in its ability to interact with DNA polymerase and may not have been defective in either helicase and primase activities, as suggested.At least one other phage T7 replication protein has a negatively charged region that participates in protein-protein interactions. T7 gene 2.5 encodes a ssDNA binding protein that is required for phage replication (2Kim Y.T. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10173-10177Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This protein has a negatively charged carboxyl terminus that functions in dimerization of the gene 2.5 protein and interactions with T7 DNA polymerase and gene 4 protein (48Kim Y.T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 269: 5270-5278Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). It is not known if a single domain of the DNA polymerase interacts with the negatively charged carboxyl-terminal domains of both the gene 2.5 protein and the gene 4 helicase/primase. However, we were not able to detect any interactions between the gene 2.5 protein and either the T7 DNA polymerase or the gene 4 helicase/primase in the native PAGE system used for the gel-shift assays in this investigation (data not shown).

The major rTIT component corresponds to an 80–90-kDa glycosylated protein.

FRTL-5 cells cultured in the presence of TSH exhibit a high rTIT content and a high iodide uptake activity (IUA). Upon either removal of TSH or addition of cycloheximide, IUA declines more rapidly than rTIT. The half-life of rTIT was about 4 days. Re-exposure of 7-day TSH-deprived FRTL-5 cells to TSH causes a rapid synthesis of the glycosylated rTIT but a delayed re-induction of IUA. Tunicamycin totally prevents the TSH-dependent re-expression and activity of rTIT. Our data bring basic information on the location, structure, and turnover of rTIT and suggest that its activity is subjected to diverse control mechanisms including regulatory proteins.

Iodide trapping by epithelial thyroid cells is the first step of thyroid hormone synthesis within thyroid follicles. Thyroid iodide uptake brings into play a membrane transporter (1Wolff J. Physiol. Rev. 1964; 44: 45-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) defined as a Na+/iodide symporter (2Kaminsky S.M. Levy O. Salvador C. Dai G. Carrasco N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3789-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). After the pioneering studies of Wolff (1Wolff J. Physiol. Rev. 1964; 44: 45-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), a definite step in the knowledge of the thyroid iodide transporter (TIT), 1The abbreviations used are: TIT, thyroid iodide transporter; rTIT, rat thyroid iodide transporter; TSH, thyrotropin; IUA, iodide uptake activity; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 1The abbreviations used are: TIT, thyroid iodide transporter; rTIT, rat thyroid iodide transporter; TSH, thyrotropin; IUA, iodide uptake activity; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. has been made by Daiet al. (3Dai G. Levy O. Carrasco N. Nature. 1996; 379: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar) who cloned the cDNA of the rat TIT (rTIT) allowing the design of tools for further molecular analyses. Secondary structure prediction and hydropathic profile analyses indicated that rTIT is a membrane protein with 12 membrane-spanning domains thus resembling the other Na+-dependent cotransporters. The availability of the rTIT primary sequence prompted us to produce antibodies to characterize the TIT protein of the rat and other animal species. We choose to generate polyclonal antibodies against a peptide corresponding to the last 16 amino acids (amino acids 603–618) of the rTIT. Antibodies that were raised exhibited a very high titer and a high specificity for a rat thyroid membrane glycoprotein fulfilling the criteria for being the rTIT. These antibodies have been used (a) to visualize the rTIT on rat thyroid tissue sections, (b) to characterize the molecular form(s) of rTIT in the rat thyroid and FRTL-5 cells, and (c) to determine the turnover of rTIT in FRTL-5 cells in relation with changes in their capacity to concentrate iodide.DISCUSSIONAntibodies directed against the synthetic peptide corresponding to the last 16 amino acids of the rTIT sequence (3Dai G. Levy O. Carrasco N. Nature. 1996; 379: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar) allowed the identification of rTIT protein(s) (a) on membrane fractions by Western blot and (b) on fixed cells by indirect immunofluorescence in both FRTL-5 cells and rat thyroid gland. The major immunoreactive form of rTIT migrates as a broad band in SDS-PAGE; its apparent molecular mass of 80–90 kDa is substantially higher than that expected from the amino acid sequence, i.e. 65 kDa (3Dai G. Levy O. Carrasco N. Nature. 1996; 379: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). This difference in size and the width of the electrophoretic band is probably attributable to the presence of N-linked oligosaccharide chains. Two potential N-linked glycosylation sites have been identified in the sixth and last extracellular loop of the predicted rTIT structure (3Dai G. Levy O. Carrasco N. Nature. 1996; 379: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). On the opposite, the deglycosylated rTIT form obtained by N-glycosidase F treatment of FRTL-5 cell membranes has an apparent molecular mass (about 55 kDa) lower than the predicted molecular mass of the polypeptide chain. Abnormal SDS binding, contributions of the intrinsic charge, and conformation of the protein as well as proteolytic cleavage are possible explanations for the abnormal electrophoretic mobility of the deglycosylated rTIT (8Weber K. Osborn M. Neurath H. Hill R.L. The Proteins. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, New York1975: 179-223Crossref Google Scholar). The occurrence of a proteolytic cleavage during the deglycosylation reaction is unlikely. Indeed, an immunoreactive form of the rTIT of the same apparent size has been identified in tunicamycin-treated FRTL-5 cells. The 55-kDa protein might thus correspond to the rTIT polypeptide chain. In addition to the 80–90-kDa component, both FRTL-5 cells and rat thyroid gland contain a second immunoreactive component with an apparent molecular mass of 60–65 kDa that we interpret as a glycosylation intermediate. This is supported by the fact that this component (a) disappeared in TSH-deprived FRTL-5 cells, (b) re-appeared (without accumulation) after re-addition of TSH, and (c) was not formed in response to TSH when cells were treated with tunicamycin. The 80–90-kDa protein, being the most abundant immunoreactive species in both rat thyroid gland and FRTL-5 cells, probably corresponds to the mature form of rTIT. This is strengthened by the fact that the anti-peptide antibodies that predominantly detected the 80–90-kDa protein, unequivocally labeled the basolateral membrane of thyrocytes where the functional form of TIT or sodium/iodide symporter should be located (9Chambard M. Verrier B. Gabrion J. Mauchamp J. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1172-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It was recently reported that sera of patients with autoimmune thyroid diseases contain antibodies against TIT, some sera labeled a single band with an apparent molecular mass of about 80 kDa on FRTL-5 cell membranes (10Endo T. Kogai T. Nakazato M. Saito T. Kaneshige M. Onaya T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and some other sera inhibited the iodide uptake activity on CHO cells stably transfected with the rTIT cDNA but did not recognize rTIT on Western blot (11Endo T. Kaneshige M. Nakazato M. Kogai T. Saito T. Onaya T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These anti-TIT auto-antibodies probably interact with extracellular loops of rTIT. The 80–90-kDa protein detected by anti-peptide antibodies in the present study and the 80-kDa species labeled by human autoantibodies likely correspond to the same molecular entity.Regulation of iodide transport by thyroid cells had been the subject of numerous studies (reviewed in Ref. 12Ekholm R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1990; 120: 243-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) using different cell systems including FRTL-5 cells (2Kaminsky S.M. Levy O. Salvador C. Dai G. Carrasco N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3789-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 6Weiss S.J. Philip N.J. Grollman E.F. Endocrinology. 1984; 114: 1090-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 7Weiss S.J. Philip N.J. Ambesi-Impiombato F.S. Grollman E.F.

It has generally been accepted that TSH regulates IUA by acting on the synthesis of the TIT and/or the formation of an activating factor (2Kaminsky S.M. Levy O. Salvador C. Dai G. Carrasco N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3789-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 7Weiss S.J. Philip N.J. Ambesi-Impiombato F.S. Grollman E.F. Endocrinology. 1984; 114: 1099-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 14Knopp J. Stolc V. Tong W. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 4403-4408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Three conclusions can be drawn from the present study.First, TSH is required for the maintenance of a steady-state level of rTIT in FRTL-5 cells, and the synthesis of rTIT is rapidly switched off or on upon suppression or re-addition of TSH. Indeed, the rate of disappearance of rTIT after TSH withdrawal was not different from the rTIT decay obtained by inhibiting protein synthesis. This is at variance with the model proposed by Kaminsky et al. (2Kaminsky S.M. Levy O. Salvador C. Dai G. Carrasco N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3789-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) in which rTIT was supposed to constitutively reside in the plasma membrane. Addition of TSH to TSH-deprived FRTL-5 cells re-activated the expression of rTIT, and within 24 h, the rTIT cell content reached a steady-state level corresponding to the rTIT level of cells continuously cultured in the presence of TSH.Second, the activity of rTIT appears to be subjected to regulatory processes. There was a marked dissociation in the time-dependent decrease of IUA and rTIT in cells treated with cycloheximide. The rapid initial loss of IUA after inhibition of protein synthesis in TSH-treated cells suggests the existence of a rTIT stimulatory protein with a turnover rate markedly higher than that of the rTIT. The involvement of such a stimulatory protein in iodide transport had been proposed long time ago by Knopp et al.(14Knopp J. Stolc V. Tong W. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 4403-4408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using dispersed thyroid cells and more recently further analyzed in FRTL-5 cells (2Kaminsky S.M. Levy O. Salvador C. Dai G. Carrasco N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3789-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, the dissociation between IUA and rTIT content under cycloheximide treatment cannot be solely explained by the disappearance of an activating factor. Indeed, after the initial decrease, IUA remained rather stable for several days despite the progressive disappearance of rTIT. One has to postulate the implication of another regulatory event. The prolonged cycloheximide treatment could deplete cells in a long-lived protein endowed with an inhibitory action on rTIT. The dissociation between IUA and rTIT cell content after both TSH suppression and TSH re-addition also suggests the existence of an activating factor, the synthesis or the activity of which slowly decreases in TSH-deprived cells and slowly increases in cells re-exposed to TSH. Modulation of the activity of rTIT might possibly involve post-translational modifications of rTIT including phosphorylation or changes in the oligomerization state. Indeed, rTIT possesses a putative phosphorylation site for protein kinase A in its C-terminal part, and functional rTIT is possibly oligomeric.Third, N-glycosylation of rTIT is essential for its synthesis and stability. In the presence of tunicamycin, the response of FRTL-5 cells (depleted in rTIT by a prolonged TSH deprivation) to TSH was limited to the transient formation of a low amount of a 55-kDa protein, presumably the rTIT polypeptide chain. As demonstrated for many other glycoproteins (15Fiedler K. Simons K. Cell. 1995; 81: 309-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), the non-glycosylated form of rTIT likely accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum where it is degraded. These data suggest that N-glycosylation is essential for correct folding and stabilization of the conformation of rTIT. Iodide trapping by epithelial thyroid cells is the first step of thyroid hormone synthesis within thyroid follicles. Thyroid iodide uptake brings into play a membrane transporter (1Wolff J. Physiol. Rev. 1964; 44: 45-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) defined as a Na+/iodide symporter (2Kaminsky S.M. Levy O. Salvador C. Dai G. Carrasco N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3789-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). After the pioneering studies of Wolff (1Wolff J. Physiol. Rev. 1964; 44: 45-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), a definite step in the knowledge of the thyroid iodide transporter (TIT), 1The abbreviations used are: TIT, thyroid iodide transporter; rTIT, rat thyroid iodide transporter; TSH, thyrotropin; IUA, iodide uptake activity; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 1The abbreviations used are: TIT, thyroid iodide transporter; rTIT, rat thyroid iodide transporter; TSH, thyrotropin; IUA, iodide uptake activity; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. has been made by Daiet al. (3Dai G. Levy O. Carrasco N. Nature. 1996; 379: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar) who cloned the cDNA of the rat TIT (rTIT) allowing the design of tools for further molecular analyses. Secondary structure prediction and hydropathic profile analyses indicated that rTIT is a membrane protein with 12 membrane-spanning domains thus resembling the other Na+-dependent cotransporters. The availability of the rTIT primary sequence prompted us to produce antibodies to characterize the TIT protein of the rat and other animal species. We choose to generate polyclonal antibodies against a peptide corresponding to the last 16 amino acids (amino acids 603–618) of the rTIT. Antibodies that were raised exhibited a very high titer and a high specificity for a rat thyroid membrane glycoprotein fulfilling the criteria for being the rTIT. These antibodies have been used (a) to visualize the rTIT on rat thyroid tissue sections, (b) to characterize the molecular form(s) of rTIT in the rat thyroid and FRTL-5 cells, and (c) to determine the turnover of rTIT in FRTL-5 cells in relation with changes in their capacity to concentrate iodide. DISCUSSIONAntibodies directed against the synthetic peptide corresponding to the last 16 amino acids of the rTIT sequence (3Dai G. Levy O. Carrasco N. Nature. 1996; 379: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar) allowed the identification of rTIT protein(s) (a) on membrane fractions by Western blot and (b) on fixed cells by indirect immunofluorescence in both FRTL-5 cells and rat thyroid gland. The major immunoreactive form of rTIT migrates as a broad band in SDS-PAGE; its apparent molecular mass of 80–90 kDa is substantially higher than that expected from the amino acid sequence, i.e. 65 kDa (3Dai G. Levy O. Carrasco N. Nature. 1996; 379: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). This difference in size and the width of the electrophoretic band is probably attributable to the presence of N-linked oligosaccharide chains. Two potential N-linked glycosylation sites have been identified in the sixth and last extracellular loop of the predicted rTIT structure (3Dai G. Levy O. Carrasco N. Nature. 1996; 379: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). On the opposite, the deglycosylated rTIT form obtained by N-glycosidase F treatment of FRTL-5 cell membranes has an apparent molecular mass (about 55 kDa) lower than the predicted molecular mass of the polypeptide chain. Abnormal SDS binding, contributions of the intrinsic charge, and conformation of the protein as well as proteolytic cleavage are possible explanations for the abnormal electrophoretic mobility of the deglycosylated rTIT (8Weber K. Osborn M. Neurath H. Hill R.L. The Proteins. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, New York1975: 179-223Crossref Google Scholar). The occurrence of a proteolytic cleavage during the deglycosylation reaction is unlikely. Indeed, an immunoreactive form of the rTIT of the same apparent size has been identified in tunicamycin-treated FRTL-5 cells. The 55-kDa protein might thus correspond to the rTIT polypeptide chain. In addition to the 80–90-kDa component, both FRTL-5 cells and rat thyroid gland contain a second immunoreactive component with an apparent molecular mass of 60–65 kDa that we interpret as a glycosylation intermediate. This is supported by the fact that this component (a) disappeared in TSH-deprived FRTL-5 cells, (b) re-appeared (without accumulation) after re-addition of TSH, and (c) was not formed in response to TSH when cells were treated with tunicamycin. The 80–90-kDa protein, being the most abundant immunoreactive species in both rat thyroid gland and FRTL-5 cells, probably corresponds to the mature form of rTIT. This is strengthened by the fact that the anti-peptide antibodies that predominantly detected the 80–90-kDa protein, unequivocally labeled the basolateral membrane of thyrocytes where the functional form of TIT or sodium/iodide symporter should be located (9Chambard M. Verrier B. Gabrion J. Mauchamp J. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1172-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It was recently reported that sera of patients with autoimmune thyroid diseases contain antibodies against TIT, some sera labeled a single band with an apparent molecular mass of about 80 kDa on FRTL-5 cell membranes (10Endo T. Kogai T. Nakazato M. Saito T. Kaneshige M. Onaya T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and some other sera inhibited the iodide uptake activity on CHO cells stably transfected with the rTIT cDNA but did not recognize rTIT on Western blot (11Endo T. Kaneshige M. Nakazato M. Kogai T. Saito T. Onaya T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These anti-TIT auto-antibodies probably interact with extracellular loops of rTIT. The 80–90-kDa protein detected by anti-peptide antibodies in the present study and the 80-kDa species labeled by human autoantibodies likely correspond to the same molecular entity.Regulation of iodide transport by thyroid cells had been the subject of numerous studies (reviewed in Ref. 12Ekholm R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1990; 120: 243-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) using different cell systems including FRTL-5 cells (2Kaminsky S.M. Levy O. Salvador C. Dai G. Carrasco N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3789-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 6Weiss S.J. Philip N.J. Grollman E.F.

It has generally been accepted that TSH regulates IUA by acting on the synthesis of the TIT and/or the formation of an activating factor (2Kaminsky S.M. Levy O. Salvador C. Dai G. Carrasco N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3789-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 7Weiss S.J. Philip N.J. Ambesi-Impiombato F.S. Grollman E.F.

Three conclusions can be drawn from the present study.First, TSH is required for the maintenance of a steady-state level of rTIT in FRTL-5 cells, and the synthesis of rTIT is rapidly switched off or on upon suppression or re-addition of TSH. Indeed, the rate of disappearance of rTIT after TSH withdrawal was not different from the rTIT decay obtained by inhibiting protein synthesis. This is at variance with the model proposed by Kaminsky et al. (2Kaminsky S.M. Levy O. Salvador C. Dai G. Carrasco N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3789-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) in which rTIT was supposed to constitutively reside in the plasma membrane. Addition of TSH to TSH-deprived FRTL-5 cells re-activated the expression of rTIT, and within 24 h, the rTIT cell content reached a steady-state level corresponding to the rTIT level of cells continuously cultured in the presence of TSH.Second, the activity of rTIT appears to be subjected to regulatory processes. There was a marked dissociation in the time-dependent decrease of IUA and rTIT in cells treated with cycloheximide. The rapid initial loss of IUA after inhibition of protein synthesis in TSH-treated cells suggests the existence of a rTIT stimulatory protein with a turnover rate markedly higher than that of the rTIT. The involvement of such a stimulatory protein in iodide transport had been proposed long time ago by Knopp et al.(14Knopp J. Stolc V. Tong W. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 4403-4408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using dispersed thyroid cells and more recently further analyzed in FRTL-5 cells (2Kaminsky S.M. Levy O. Salvador C. Dai G. Carrasco N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3789-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, the dissociation between IUA and rTIT content under cycloheximide treatment cannot be solely explained by the disappearance of an activating factor. Indeed, after the initial decrease, IUA remained rather stable for several days despite the progressive disappearance of rTIT. One has to postulate the implication of another regulatory event. The prolonged cycloheximide treatment could deplete cells in a long-lived protein endowed with an inhibitory action on rTIT. The dissociation between IUA and rTIT cell content after both TSH suppression and TSH re-addition also suggests the existence of an activating factor, the synthesis or the activity of which slowly decreases in TSH-deprived cells and slowly increases in cells re-exposed to TSH. Modulation of the activity of rTIT might possibly involve post-translational modifications of rTIT including phosphorylation or changes in the oligomerization state. Indeed, rTIT possesses a putative phosphorylation site for protein kinase A in its C-terminal part, and functional rTIT is possibly oligomeric.Third, N-glycosylation of rTIT is essential for its synthesis and stability. In the presence of tunicamycin, the response of FRTL-5 cells (depleted in rTIT by a prolonged TSH deprivation) to TSH was limited to the transient formation of a low amount of a 55-kDa protein, presumably the rTIT polypeptide chain. As demonstrated for many other glycoproteins (15Fiedler K. Simons K. Cell. 1995; 81: 309-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), the non-glycosylated form of rTIT likely accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum where it is degraded. These data suggest that N-glycosylation is essential for correct folding and stabilization of the conformation of rTIT. Antibodies directed against the synthetic peptide corresponding to the last 16 amino acids of the rTIT sequence (3Dai G. Levy O. Carrasco N.

Based on peptide sequences from the smaller enzyme, a 3.9-kilobase pair (kb) cDNA with an open reading frame encoding a 90-kDa protein was isolated from a bovine brain cDNA library. Expression of this cDNA in COS-7 cells yielded a 110-kDa protein with WT-sensitive PI 4-kinase activity. Northern blot analysis of a human mRNA panel showed a single ∼3.8-kb transcript. Peptide sequences obtained from the 210-kDa enzyme corresponded to those of a recently described rat 230-kDa PI 4-kinase.

Irvine R.F. Nature. 1984; 312: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (4249) Google Scholar). Early studies indicated that multiple PI kinases are present in cellular homogenates, based on their individual sensitivities to detergents (2Harwood J.L. Hawthorne J.N. Biochim. Biophys.

A 210-kDa form of PI 3-kinase has also been reported in Drosophila (24MacDougall L.K. Domin J. Waterfield M.D. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1404-1415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Recently, the fungal metabolite wortmannin (WT), a potent inhibitor of PI 3-kinases, has been used to define cellular functions that are regulated by PI 3-kinases. Although WT was not believed to inhibit PI 4-kinases (25Yano H. Nakanishi S. Kimura K. Hanai N. Saitoh Y. Fukui Y. Nonomura Y. Matsuda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25846-25856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Arcaro A. Wymann M.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar, 27Okada T. Kawano Y. Sakakibara T. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3568-3573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we observed that micromolar concentrations of the compound abolish the sustained formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate in agonist-stimulated cells by inhibiting a PI 4-kinase enzyme (28Nakanishi S. Catt K.J. Balla T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5317-5321Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Further characterization of this soluble (loosely membrane-bound) WT-sensitive PI 4-kinase activity demonstrated its similarity to the type III PI 4-kinase and showed that the bovine brain type III enzyme (as originally described) displays similar WT sensitivity (29Downing G.J. Kim S. Nakanishi S. Catt K.J. Balla T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3587-3594Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In contrast, the major cellular PI 4-kinase activity, the type II enzyme, was insensitive to WT and thus unlikely to participate in the synthesis of hormone-sensitive phosphoinositide pools (29Downing G.J. Kim S. Nakanishi S. Catt K.J. Balla T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3587-3594Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The sensitivity of the type III PI 4-kinase(s) to WT (although significantly less than that of PI 3-kinases) raised the possibility that they have structural similarities to PI 3-kinases. In the present study we report the purification of 110- and 210-kDa WT-sensitive, type III PI 4-kinase enzymes from the bovine adrenal cortex, and the molecular cloning of cDNAs encoding these novel enzymes. DEAE-Sepharose, SP-Sepharose (bulk media), and heparin-Sepharose, butyl-Sepharose, MonoQ, and MonoS columns were from Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden). Phosphatidylinositol and ATP were from Fluka (Ronkonkoma, NY) and Sigma, respectively. [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) and [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) were from Amersham, and [3H]wortmannin-17-ol (19.7 Ci/mmol) was from NEN Life Science Products. Reagents for SDS-PAGE were obtained from Bio-Rad, CA), and restriction enzymes were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. or New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). The T/A cloning kit was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI), and the sequencing kits from Amersham. All other chemicals were of HPLC or analytical grade. In the final purification, 60 bovine adrenal cortices were homogenized in three batches (20 each) in Buffer A (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.3, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm AEBSF, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) containing 1m NaCl as described previously (29Downing G.J. Kim S. Nakanishi S. Catt K.J. Balla T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3587-3594Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), except that the volumes were upscaled proportionally. All manipulations were performed at 4 °C unless otherwise indicated. After centrifugation (100,000 × g, 90 min), the supernatant was taken to 40% ammonium sulfate (40% saturation) and the precipitated material collected by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 20 min) and the pellets stored at −70 °C until further processing. Ammonium sulfate precipitates were dissolved in 100 ml of Buffer A and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 10 volumes of Buffer A containing 30 mm NaCl. The dialyzed protein solution was then diluted to 500 ml with Buffer A/30 mm NaCl and applied to a 5 × 70-cm DEAE-Sepharose column pre-equilibrated with the same buffer. After loading, the column was washed with 2 liters of Buffer A, 30 mm NaCl and eluted with a linear gradient of 0.03–0.5m NaCl in Buffer A with a flow rate of 10 ml/min. The PI 4-kinase activity of the fractions was measured as described previously (28Nakanishi S. Catt K.J. Balla T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5317-5321Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Active fractions were combined and diluted with Buffer B (20 mm MES, pH 6.8, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 100 μm AEBSF, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) to a conductance of 5 millisiemens/cm. This material was loaded onto an SP-Sepharose column (1.5 × 50 cm) that was pre-equilibrated with Buffer B. After loading, the column was washed with 300 ml Buffer B and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–1 m KCl in Buffer B at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Active fractions were combined again and diluted with Buffer A to a conductance of 22 millisiemens/cm and applied to a 5-ml heparin-Sepharose minicolumn, which was equilibrated with 0.2 m NaCl in Buffer A. The column was washed with 20 ml of Buffer A, 0.2 m NaCl and then fitted to an HPLC system (Gilson, Middleton, WI) for elution with a gradient of 0.2–1m NaCl in Buffer A at a flow rate of 1 ml/min at room temperature. The UV absorption (280 nm) of the eluent was monitored by a Stratos UV-detector (Thomson Instruments, Vienna, VA), and 1-ml fractions were collected on ice. Active fractions were saved and stored at −20 °C with 10% glycerol. The active fractions from three such purifications were combined and re-chromatographed on the Heparin column to concentrate samples and remove glycerol. Ammonium sulfate was then added to the active fractions (80 mg/ml), and the material was loaded onto a 10-ml butyl-Sepharose minicolumn that was pre-equilibrated with Buffer A/80 mg/ml ammonium sulfate at room temperature. After loading, the column was washed with the same buffer until the absorption of the eluent returned to base line. At this point the column was eluted with Buffer A at 1 ml/min, and 1.5-min fractions were collected. Active fractions were pooled, diluted with three volumes of Buffer A, and loaded onto a Mono Q column (HR 5/5). The column was washed with Buffer A, 50 mm NaCl for 10 min and eluted with a linear gradient of 0.05–0.5 m NaCl in Buffer A over 50 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Two peaks of activity were eluted from this column and were collected and pooled separately. The pooled fractions were diluted with two volumes of Buffer B and loaded onto a Mono S columns (HR 5/5), followed by a 10-min wash with 50 mm KCl in Buffer B and elution with a linear gradient of 0.05–0.5 m KCl in Buffer B over 50 min at 1 ml/min. Fractions that contained the activity were combined, precipitated with 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, and analyzed on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After Coomassie staining, the bands that corresponded to the respective enzymes previously identified with [3H]WT binding (see below) were cut out for subsequent peptide sequencing. Coomassie-stained bands at 210 and 110 kDa were excised and subjected to in situproteolytic digestion with modified trypsin (sequencing grade, Promega, Madison, WI) essentially according to the method of Moritz et al. (30Moritz R.L. Eddes J. Hong J. Reid G.E. Simpson R.J. Crabb J.M. Techniques in Protein Chemistry VI. Academic Press, San Diego1995: 311-319Google Scholar). Washing steps were performed at 50 °C. The resulting digest was separated at 0.25 ml/min with a gradient described by Fernandez et al. (31Fernandez J. DeMott M. Atherton D. Mische S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) on a narrow bore (2.1 × 250 mm) Vydac 218TP52 column and guard column (Separations Group, Hesperia, CA) at 35 °C using a System Gold HPLC equipped with a model 507 autosampler, model 126 programmable solvent module, and model 168 diode array detector (Beckman, Fullerton, CA). The column effluent was monitored at 215 and 280 nm, and fractions collected at 30-s intervals were stored at −70 °C. Fractions (125 μl) containing tryptic peptides were applied in 30-μl aliquots to a Biobrene (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA)-treated glass fiber filter and dried prior to amino acid sequencing on a model 477A pulsed-liquid protein sequencer equipped with a model 120A PTH analyzer (Applied Biosystems) using methods and cycles supplied by the manufacturer. Data were collected and processed by a model 610A data analysis system (Applied Biosystems). Amino acid sequences were searched in the GCG-Swiss Protein Data base (University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group). Aliquots of the fractions eluted from the various columns were incubated for 20 min at room temperature in a total volume of 100 μl of PBS containing 0.4 μCi of [3H]WT-17-ol. This corresponds to 200 nm WT, a concentration that is sufficient to label proteins with lower affinity to WT than PI 3-kinase. In some cases the samples were preincubated with 10 nm unlabeled WT for 10 min prior to labeling to occupy high-affinity binding sites such as those of the PI 3-kinase(s). Proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (5% final) and subjected to SDS-PAGE. When ethanol precipitation was used instead of trichloroacetic acid (since WT binding has been reported to be acid-labile), there was no difference in the protein labeling. After fixation and Coomassie staining, the gels were impregnated with EN3HANCE (NEN Life Science Products) solution, and after drying were exposed at -70 °C for 1–2 weeks with Hyperfilm (Amersham). A size-enriched cDNA library was created in the pSPORT1 plasmid from bovine brain cortex using sucrose-fractionated (>2.5 kb) poly(A)+-selected RNA and the Superscript™ plasmid system for cDNA cloning (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instruction. This library contained 1.25 million primary clones and after amplification was stored in aliquots of glycerol stock at −70 °C. An oligonucleotide primer was designed from the peptide sequence, QLQSIWEQE, obtained from tryptic fragments of the 110-kDa PI 4-kinase, and an antisense primer based on the conserved KDRHNGN sequence that is common to all known PI 4-kinases. PCR amplification using this primer pair (5′-ctgcaRtctatttgggaRcaag-3′ and 5′-attgttaccgttgtgtctgtcctt-3′) yielded a 300-bp product, which was ligated into the PGEM-Easy plasmid (Promega) and subjected to dideoxy sequencing. This DNA fragment, which encoded an amino acid sequence with high homology to PIK1, was random primer-labeled and used to screen the size-enriched bovine brain cDNA library. Homology search of the data base with the 300-bp sequence also revealed high homology to a rat EST (R46930) (Y-162) that was subsequently provided by Dr. Y. Yamada (NIDR, National Institutes of Health) and on sequencing showed extensive homology with PIK1. The 1.3-kb EcoRI/XhoI insert of this clone was also used for screening the bovine brain library in subsequent experiments. Positive colonies were isolated and the plasmids cut withEcoRI/NotI restriction enzymes to determine their insert-size. Several clones were isolated and sequenced, the longest of which (c354) contained a 3-kb insert. The missing 5′ end of the mRNA was obtained by 5′-RACE (version 2.0, Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. The full-length clone used for transfection studies was created by long-range PCR amplification (Elongase, Life Technologies, Inc.) from cDNA prepared by reverse transcriptase (Superscript, Life Technologies, Inc.; Rethrotherm, Epicentre Technologies) from mRNA isolated from cultured bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells. The primers used for this amplification were (5′-aggatccgagaaatggcacacctcag-3′ and 5′-cggcaagctctagagttaccacatgatc-3′), and the 3.3-kb product was ligated into the pcDNA3.1(+) plasmid (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) after digestion with XbaI/BamHI. The isolation of the cDNA encoding the 210-kDa enzyme was initially attempted by colony hybridization of the brain cDNA library with a PCR-amplified fragment of the human PI4Kα, due to the homology indicated by the peptide sequences obtained from the 210-kDa bovine protein. The longest insert isolated was a 3.3-kb product that lacked a poly(A)+ tail due to the use of NotI enzyme during creation of the cDNA library and the presence of an internalNotI site after the stop codon in this sequence. The 3′-untranslated region was then obtained by 3′-RACE, and the 5′ end of the transcript was amplified with PCR using primers based on the rat sequence (32Nakagawa T. Goto K. Kondo H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12088-12094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) that became available during the course of these studies. Completion of the 5′ sequence information was achieved by amplification from the cDNA library with 5′ primers designed on the flanking plasmid (pSPORT1) sequence. Full-length expressable clones were created by long-range PCR amplification from the cDNA of bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells (primers: 5′cgcggatcctgtgca-gagaccggcatgtgtggag-3′ and 5′-cggaattccacacagagaccggctctgattgtc-3′) and ligation of the 6.3-kb product into the pcDNA3.1(+) plasmid after digestion withBamHI and EcoRI. Northern blot analysis was performed utilizing an mRNA panel of several human tissues (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) and the random primer-labeled 1.8-kb fragment of the EcoRI digest of one of the clones (c365) (corresponding to nucleotides 1960–3750 of PI4KIIIβ) or the full 2.9-kb insert of a partial clone of PI4KIIIα (c2D5) (3286–6200). After prehybridization at 42 °C in Hybrisol I (Oncor, Gaithersburg, MD), hybridization was performed overnight at 42 °C. The blot was washed several times with increased stringency with a final wash of 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55 °C for 10 min. The blots were analyzed both by autoradiography and by a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). COS-7 cells were grown to about 70% confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum on 10 cm culture dishes. Cells were transfected with 5 ml of Opti-MEM medium containing 10 μg/ml LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 5 μg plasmid DNA (pcDNA3.1(+), containing the PCR-amplified clone of PI4KIIIβ). After 8 h the medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/10% fetal bovine serum and culture was continued for selected periods. PI 4-kinase activity was then measured in the soluble fractions after lysing the cells in 500 μl of ice-cold Buffer A containing 150 mmNaCl, followed by sonication and centrifugation at 14,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. For [3H]WT binding, the supernatants obtained from two such plates were combined, diluted, and applied to 1-ml DEAE-Sepharose columns, and after washing, eluted with 500 mm NaCl in Buffer A. This eluent was then concentrated on Amicon filters and subjected to PI 4-kinase activity measurement and [3H]WT binding followed by SDS-PAGE. As reported previously (29Downing G.J. Kim S. Nakanishi S. Catt K.J. Balla T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3587-3594Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), two PI 4-kinase activities with native molecular sizes of ∼110 and ∼200 kDa were identified and partially purified from the bovine adrenal cortex. The catalytic properties of the two components were indistinguishable, raising the possibility that the two peaks represent monomeric and dimeric forms of the same enzyme or that the larger is a heterodimer associated with another protein subunit. Based on the presumed similarity with PI 3-kinases, a purification procedure similar to that used for preparation of PI 3-kinases (33Carpenter C.L. Duckworth B.C. Auger K.R. Cohen B. Schaffhausen B.S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19704-19711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Shibasaki F. Homma Y. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8108-8114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was employed by sequential chromatographies on DEAE-Sepharose, SP-Sepharose, heparin-Sepharose, butyl-Sepharose, MonoQ, and MonoS columns (Fig.1). Two activities were clearly separated on MonoQ chromatography, and [3H]WT-17-ol-binding (35Thelen M. Wymann M.P. Langen H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4960-4964Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) was used to correlate the PI 4-kinase activity of the effluent fractions with the [3H]WT labeling of the proteins. As shown in Fig.2, SDS-PAGE analysis of the WT-labeled proteins revealed that the two peaks of PI 4-kinase activity correlated with two labeled proteins of ∼210 and ∼110 kDa. The radioactivity bound to these proteins was only slightly reduced by preincubation of the fractions with 10 nm unlabeled WT (Fig. 3). Such treatment greatly reduced the labeling of PI 3-kinase(s) (data not shown), consistent with the higher affinity of these enzymes for WT (29Downing G.J. Kim S. Nakanishi S. Catt K.J. Balla T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3587-3594Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar).Figure 2Separation of WT-sensitive PI 4-kinase activities by MonoQ ion exchange chromatography. Enzyme preparations enriched by sequential chromatographies (Fig. 1) were loaded on a MonoQ HR 5/5 column and eluted with a gradient of NaCl as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” PI 4-kinase activity measurements and [3H]WT-binding followed by SDS-PAGE analysis was performed on the effluent fractions.

Active fractions eluted from the MonoQ column (Fig. 2) containing the 210-kDa and 110-kDa PI 4-kinase, respectively, were loaded on MonoS HR 5/5 columns and eluted with a KCl gradient as described under “Experimental Procedures.” PI 4-kinase activity measurements and [3H]WT-binding followed by SDS-PAGE analysis were performed on the effluent fractions. [3H]WT-binding was only slightly reduced by 10 min preincubation of the samples with 10 nm unlabeled WT (lower strip of bands) consistent with the lower affinity of these enzymes for WT. Similar treatment greatly reduced the labeling of PI 3-kinase (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Due to their relatively low abundance, these proteins were not purified to homogeneity even after passage through multiple chromatography steps. However, WT labeling allowed their clear identification on SDS gels after Coomassie staining. The two protein bands of interest were then cut out from the gels and digested with trypsin. Only one unequivocal peptide sequence was obtained from the larger enzyme: EFDFFNK, which showed homology to a recently cloned human PI 4-kinase, PI4Kα (36Wong K. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28878-28884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and to the yeast PI 4-kinase, STT4 (37Yoshida S. Ohya Y. Goebl M. Nakano A. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1166-1171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other peptide peaks from the digest were mixtures of peptides that yielded multiple sequences that were homologous to PI4Kα (data not shown). Further purification of the peptides was not attempted because of the minute amounts available. Although the predicted molecular size of PI4Kα is only 97 kDa, we concluded that it probably represents a smaller splice variant of the 210-kDa bovine enzyme, which would be the mammalian homolog of the yeast 200-kDa STT4. Tryptic digestion of the smaller protein yielded seven unequivocal peptide sequences (LSEQLAHTPTAFK, QLQSIWEQE, VENEDEPVR, LATLPTK, EFIK, EPVFIAAGDIR, and EPGVQA). None of these exhibited homology to any known protein sequence available in the data base. However, a computer alignment of the three human PI 3-kinases (α, β, and γ), and the 125-kDa yeast PI 4-kinase, PIK1, together with one of the sequences, QLQSIWEQE, revealed a possible alignment for the latter (see Fig. 8). This served as the basis for designing primers so that further sequence information could be obtained from this enzyme. A primer was designed based on the comparison of the nucleotide sequences encoding QLQSIWEQE, and the corresponding nucleotide sequences of PIK1 and the three PI 3-kinases based on the putative amino acid alignment described above. This primer was used in combination with another primer designed on a conserved sequence (KDRHNGN) that is present in all of the then-known PI 4-kinases (PIK1, STT4, and PI4Kα) but differs slightly in all PI 3-kinases (GDRHNXN). Amplification of a size-enriched bovine brain cDNA library with these primers yielded a 300-bp product with a nucleotide sequence showing extensive homology with PIK1. Screening of the size-enriched bovine brain cDNA library with this product yielded several clones, one of which contained a 3.0-kb insert (c354). Sequencing of this clone confirmed its homology with PIK1, especially within its catalytic domain, and revealed an open reading frame that encoded all seven peptide sequences obtained fro"

Vanillyl-alcohol oxidase (VAO, 1The abbreviation used is: VAO, vanillyl-alcohol oxidase. EC1.1.3.13) from Penicillium simplicissimum is a novel flavoprotein that acts on a wide range of 4-hydroxybenzylic compounds (1Fraaije M.W. Veeger C. Van Berkel W.J.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 2Fraaije M.W. Drijfhout F. Meulenbeld G.H. Van Berkel W.J.H. Mattevi A. Flavins and Flavoproteins XII.in: Stevenson K. Massey V. Williams Jr., C.H. University Press, Calgary, 1997Google Scholar). VAO is a homo-octamer, with each subunit containing 8α-(N 3-histidyl)-FAD as a prosthetic group (3De Jong E. van Berkel W.J.H. van der Zwan R.P. De Bont J.A.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). During catalysis, the flavin cofactor is first reduced and subsequently reoxidized by molecular oxygen to yield hydrogen peroxide. In addition to the oxidation of aromatic alcohols also, demethylation, deamination, and hydroxylation reactions are being catalyzed as shown in Equation 1. By its versatile catalytic potential, VAO may develop as a useful biocatalyst for applications in the fine chemical industry (4Van Berkel, W. J. H., Fraaije, M. W. & De Jong, E. (December 2, 1997) European Patent application 0710289B1.Google Scholar). VAO is readily induced in P. simplicissimum by growth on veratryl alcohol (3De Jong E. van Berkel W.J.H. van der Zwan R.P. De Bont J.A.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Although the enzyme is produced in relatively high amounts, the physiological role of the enzyme remained obscure for some time as VAO is not involved in the degradation of this aromatic alcohol. Only recently, it was found that the VAO-mediated oxidative demethylation of 4-(methoxymethyl)phenol is of metabolic relevance (5Fraaije M.W. Pikkemaat M. Van Berkel W.J.H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 435-439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When P. simplicissimum is grown on this phenolic methylether, VAO is induced and catalyzes the first step of the degradation pathway of 4-(methoxymethyl)phenol. Furthermore, analogs of 4-(methoxymethyl)phenol can easily be envisaged as physiological substrates enabling this ascomycetous fungus to cope with a wide variety of lignin decomposition products (5Fraaije M.W.

A striking feature of all substrates is the necessity of ap-hydroxyl group that is probably a prerequisite for binding. Moreover, a large pK a shift observed upon binding of the competitive inhibitor isoeugenol indicates that substrates become deprotonated upon binding (1Fraaije M.W. Veeger C. Van Berkel W.J.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). For the reaction of VAO with the substrate eugenol, it was established that the oxygen atom incorporated into the formed product coniferyl alcohol is derived from water. From these results, a catalytic mechanism for the hydroxylation of eugenol was proposed which involves formation of ap-quinone methide intermediate (1Fraaije M.W. Veeger C. Van Berkel W.J.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A similar catalytic mechanism has been proposed for the hydroxylation of 4-alkylphenols by the flavocytochrome, p-cresol methylhydroxylase (6Hopper D.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 69: 462-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). So far, no real evidence has ever been presented for the formation ofp-quinone methide intermediates during flavin-mediated reactions. We have suggested that hydride transfer to the oxidized flavin cofactor following deprotonation of the substrate would be a feasible sequence of reactions leading to the formation of the labilep-quinone methide intermediate (1Fraaije M.W. Veeger C. Van Berkel W.J.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Hydride transfer mechanisms have been proposed for several other flavin-dependent oxidases like methanol oxidase (7Menon V. Hsieh C-T. Fitzpatrick P.F. Bioorg. Chem. 1995; 23: 42-53Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and cholesterol oxidase (8Li J. Vrielink A. Brick P. Blow D.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11507-11515Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Recently, Mattevi et al. (9Mattevi A. Vanoni M.A. Todone F. Rizzi M. Teplyakov A. Coda A. Bolognesi M. Curti B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7496-7501Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) provided evidence from crystallographic studies that, ford-amino acid oxidase also, a hydrid transfer is a likely event during catalysis. Because well diffracting crystals of VAO have been obtained, we aim to relate the catalytic properties of this flavoenzyme with the crystal structure in the near future (10Mattevi A. Fraaije M.W. Coda A. van Berkel W.J.H. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1997; 27: 601-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In this paper, we report on the kinetic and catalytic mechanism of VAO with the physiological substrate 4-(methoxymethyl)phenol. Evidence from rapid reaction studies is presented which shows that the hydroxylation of phenolic compounds by VAO involves the formation of ap-quinone methide intermediate. Vanillyl alcohol (4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzyl alcohol; R1⋕OCH3, R2⋕H, and R3⋕OH in Equation 1) was included as a model substrate in this study to examine both an oxidative demethylation and an alcohol oxidation reaction. VAO was purified from P. simplicissimum as described by De Jong et al. (3De Jong E. van Berkel W.J.H. van der Zwan R.P. De Bont J.A.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) with the modification that a 200-liter fermentor was used for cultivation and that cells were disrupted using a Manton-Gaulin homogenizer. The ratio A280/A439 for the purified enzyme was 11.0. Glucose oxidase (grade II) and catalase were from Boehringer Mannheim. H218O (97 mol/100 mol18O) was obtained from Campro (Veenendaal, The Netherlands). Vanillyl alcohol, vanillin (4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde), 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, and 4(methoxymethyl)phenol were purchased from Aldrich. All experiments were performed at 25 °C in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, unless stated otherwise. VAO concentrations were calculated from the molar absorption coefficient of the oxidized form (ε439 nm = 12.5 mm−1 cm−1 (3De Jong E. van Berkel W.J.H. van der Zwan R.P. De Bont J.A.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar)). For 18O incorporation experiments, 195 μl of H218O was added to 400 μl of 1.0 mm substrate solutions. After addition of VAO (25 μl, 200 μm) and catalase (5 μl, 100 μm), the samples were incubated for 5 min at 25 °C and subsequently twice extracted with 500 μl diethylether. After evaporation, the samples were analyzed by GC/MS. GC/MS analysis was performed on a Hewlett Packard HP 5973 MSD and HP 6090 GC equipped with an HP-5 column. Steady-state kinetic experiments were performed essentially as described earlier (1Fraaije M.W. Veeger C. Van Berkel W.J.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Vanillyl alcohol and 4-(methoxymethyl)phenol activity were determined spectrophotometrically by recording the formation of vanillin (ε340 nm (pH 7.5) = 14.0 mm−1 cm−1) and 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (ε340 nm (pH 7.5) = 10.0 mm−1 cm−1), respectively. Oxygen concentrations were varied by mixing buffers saturated with 100% nitrogen and 100% oxygen in different ratios. Stopped-flow kinetics were carried out with a Hi-Tech SF-51 apparatus equipped with a Hi-Tech M300 monochromator diode-array detector (Salisbury, United Kingdom). Spectral scans were collected each 10 ms. For accurate estimation of rate constants, single wavelength kinetic traces were recorded at 439 nm using a Hi-Tech SU-40 spectrophotometer. In anaerobic experiments, solutions were flushed with argon and contained glucose (10 mm) and glucose oxidase (0.1 μm) to ensure anaerobic conditions. To determine the maximal rate of enzyme reduction by 4-(methoxymethyl)phenol and vanillyl alcohol, apparent rates were determined at five different substrate concentrations. To obtain accurate estimations of reduction rate constants observed during anaerobic reduction by vanillyl-alcohol, measurements were also performed at 355 and 393 nm. Deconvolution analysis of spectral data was performed using the Specfit Global Analysis program Version 2.10 (Spectrum Software Assn., Chapel Hill, NC). Solutions containing reduced enzyme (5 μm) were prepared by titrating argon flushed enzyme solutions with dithionite. For generation of the reduced enzyme intermediate complex, the enzyme was anaerobically mixed with a 1.5-fold excess of 4-(methoxymethyl)phenol. Reoxidation of reduced enzyme was measured by monitoring the increase in absorption at 439 nm after mixing with molecular oxygen. Reduced enzyme (5.0 μm) was mixed with varying concentrations of molecular oxygen (10, 21, 50, and 100% saturation) to determine the second-order rate constants for the reoxidation of protein-bound flavin. For enzyme-monitored turnover experiments (11Gibson Q.H. Swoboda B.E.P. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 3927-3934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), air-saturated enzyme and substrate solutions were mixed in the stopped-flow instrument after which the redox state of the flavin cofactor was recorded at 439 nm. In a previous report, we already identified the products formed from 4-(methoxymethyl)phenol and vanillyl alchohol as their corresponding aldehydes (1Fraaije M.W. Veeger C. Van Berkel W.J.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In this study, H218O was used to test the involvement of water in the VAO-mediated conversion of 4-(methoxymethyl)phenol and vanillyl alcohol. Substrate solutions (containing 30% H218O (w/w)) were incubated for 5 min in the presence of a catalytical amount of enzyme. Blank reactions with the aromatic products 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde and vanillin revealed that, under these conditions, less than 5% of the carbonylic oxygen atoms had exchanged with H218O. For the VAO-mediated conversion of 4-(methoxymethyl)phenol, it was found that the aromatic product 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde was fully hydroxylated by action of water (97 ± 4%) (Fig. 1). The incorporation of18O confirms an earlier finding (1Fraaije M.W. Veeger C. Van Berkel W.J.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) that conversion of 4-(methoxymethyl)phenol by VAO results in cleavage of the methoxyl group as methanol. The VAO catalyzed oxidation of vanillyl alcohol to vanillin did not result in significant 18O incorporation (Fig. 1). This shows that with this alcoholic substrate water is not involved in the enzymatic reaction. By measuring the VAO activity upon varying the concentration of oxygen at different 4-(methoxymethyl)phenol concentrations, a set of parallel Lineweaver-Burk plots was obtained. This suggests that for this reaction a ping-pong mechanism may be operative. Parallel line kinetics can, however, also occur in some limited cases of a ternary complex mechanism where some specific rate constants are relatively small (12Palmer G. Massey V. Singer T.P. Biological Oxidations. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1968: 263-300Google Scholar,13Porter D.J.T. Voet J.G. Bright H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4464-4473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows a secondary plot of the extrapolated turnover rates at saturating oxygen concentrations versusthe concentration of 4-(methoxymethyl)phenol. From this, the steady-state kinetic parameters with 4-(methoxymethyl)phenol could be calculated (Table I). The steady-state kinetic parameters for vanillyl alcohol were similarly determined (again showing series of parallel secondary plots) and were in the same range as for 4-(methoxymethyl)phenol (k cat = 3.3 s−1, K m, S = 160 μm, K m, O2 = 28 μm). The relatively high K m value for vanillyl alcohol might result from the more polar character of the benzylic moiety compared with 4-(methoxymethyl)phenol (1Fraaije M.W. Veeger C. Van Berkel W.J.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).Table IKinetic constants for the reaction of 4-(methoxymethyl)phenol with vanillyl-alcohol oxidase from P. simplicissimum (pH 7.5, 25 °C)ConstantExperimentalCalculatedk −1/k 148 μmk 2 (=k red)3.3 s−1k −2∼0k 31-ak 3 ≈k cat/K m (O2).1.5 × 105m−1 s−11.4 × 105m−1 s−1k 41-bk 4 calculated fromk cat =k 2 · k 4/(k 2+ k 4).50 s−1k 50.01 s−1k 63.1 × 105m−1 s−1k cat3.1 s−1K m (S)1-cK m (S) =k 4(k −1 +k 2)/k 1(k 2 +k 4).55 μm45 μmk m (O2)1-dK m(O2) =k 4(k 2 +k −2)/k 3(k 2 +k 4).24 μm21 μm1-a k 3 ≈k cat/K m (O2).1-b k 4 calculated fromk cat =k 2 · k 4/(k 2+ k 4).1-c K m (S) =k 4(k −1 +k 2)/k 1(k 2 +k 4).1-d K m(O2) =k 4(k 2 +k −2)/k 3(k 2 +k 4). Open table in a new tab By measuring the redox state of the flavin cofactor during catalysis (enzyme-monitored turnover), information can be obtained about the rate-limiting step (11Gibson Q.H. Swoboda B.E.P. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 3927-3934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For this, the enzyme was aerobically mixed in the stopped-flow apparatus with a high concentration of substrate. It should be noted here that due to the low solubility of vanillyl alcohol and 4-(methoxymethyl)phenol, the substrate concentrations (500 μm) were not fully saturating. During turnover, the absorbance at 439 nm was monitored to detect the amount of oxidized enzyme present. Fig. 3 shows that with both substrates most of the enzyme is in the oxidized state during turnover. The fraction of oxidized enzyme for both substrates was almost identical, 0.86 for 4-(methoxymethyl)phenol and 0.91 for vanillyl alcohol (Fig.3). This suggests that processes involving flavin reduction are slower than those of the oxidative part of the catalytic cycle. To study the reductive half-reaction of VAO, the oxidized enzyme was mixed with substrate in the stopped-flow spectrophotometer under anaerobic conditions. Reduction of VAO by 4-(methoxymethyl)phenol was a monophasic process when monitored at 439 nm. Diode-array detection revealed that anaerobic enzymatic reaction with 4-(methoxymethyl)phenol resulted in the formation of a species with an intense absorption maximum at 364 nm (ε364 nm = 46 mm−1cm−1) (Fig. 4). During this process, the flavin becomes fully reduced as evidenced by the decrease in absorbance at 439 nm. This indicates that the rate of the reverse reaction must be relatively small. The rate of flavin reduction at saturated substrate concentrations was in the same range as the turnover rate (Table I). pH-dependent anaerobic reductions by 4(methoxymethyl)phenol revealed that the spectral properties of the formed intermediate were not influenced between pH 6.8 and 7.9. Furthermore, reduction at the tested pH values did not result in a significant change of the rate of reduction. When the spectral changes were followed on a longer time scale (>20 s), a very slow decay of the high absorbance intermediate was observed. The resulting spectrum could be characterized as the composite of reduced enzyme and the product 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Indicative for aldehyde formation was the increase in absorbance around 335 nm, which was even more pronounced at higher pH due to deprotonation of the phenolic group (pK a 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde = 7.6). The rate of aldehyde formation under anaerobic conditions was estimated to be 0.01 s−1, which is too slow to be of catalytical relevance. The results obtained from the anaerobic reduction of VAO with 4-(methoxymethyl)phenol are consistent with the following Equation2, Eox+S*⇄k−1k1*Eox∼S*⇄k−2k2*Ered∼Q*→k5*Ered+PEquation 2 where Q represents the high absorbance intermediate. Reduction of VAO by vanillyl alcohol showed biphasic absorption traces at 439 nm. Diode array analysis revealed that during reduction an intermediate spectrum is formed with a typical absorption maximum at 362 nm (Fig. 5, A and B). As can be seen from Fig. 5 A, this intermediate decayed rapidly to yield fully reduced enzyme. For accurate kinetic data, rate constants of both reductive phases were determined at various substrate concentrations by monitoring the reaction at isosbestic points (393 and 355 nm, see Fig. 5 B). It was found that the first rapid phase was an order of magnitude faster compared with the slow phase (k red1 = 24 s−1,K d = 270 μm compared withk red2 = 3.5 s−1,K d = 150 μm; Fig. 6). Using a consecutive irreversible reaction model in which the first reaction corresponds to the fast process, spectral deconvolution produced well defined spectra for the initial, intermediate, and final components (Fig. 5 B, traces A,B, and C). As can be seen from Fig. 5 Bthe distinctive absorption maximum of the intermediate spectrum formed in the first phase showed some resemblance with the intermediate spectrum formed by anaerobic reduction of VAO with 4-(methoxymethyl)phenol (see Fig. 4 inset). This analogy was confirmed by performing the anaerobic reduction experiments with vanillyl alcohol at different pH values (Fig. 5 B). As with 4-(methoxymethyl)phenol, no significant effect of pH on the observed reduction rates was observed. Furthermore, these studies again showed that in contrast to the transient intermediate spectrum, the final spectrum is pH-dependent. This indicates that the final product vanillin is formed only in the second step as the spectral properties of the final spectrum agree nicely with formation of vanillin (pK a = 7.5, λmax = 345 nm). Furthermore, in the case of vanillyl alcohol, the flavin apparently is only partially reduced when the high absorbance intermediate is formed as the absorbance at 439 nm is relatively high after the first reductive phase (Fig. 5 B).Figure 6Double-reciprocal plot of the two reduction rates observed during the anaerobic reductive half-reaction of VAO with vanillyl alcohol (•, k red1; ○,k red2).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To measure the rate of reoxidation, reduced VAO was mixed with molecular oxygen in the stopped-flow spectrophotometer, and the increase of the flavin absorbance at 439 nm was monitored. Reoxidation of free-reduced VAO was a monophasic reaction resulting in formation of fully oxidized enzyme. By varying the concentration of oxygen, it was found that reoxidation of free-reduced VAO is a fast bimolecular process (3.1 ×105m−1 s−1) as has been found for other flavoprotein oxidases (14Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22459-22462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ered(∼L)+O2*→k6(k3)*Eox(∼L)+H2O2Equation 3 For flavoprotein oxidases, the rate of enzyme reoxidation can significantly be influenced by bound ligands (L in Equation3) (15Tan A.K. Ramsay R.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2137-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). For instance, in the case of d-amino acid oxidase from yeast, it was reported that reoxidation of free-reduced enzyme is not of catalytical significance as it is significantly slower than the turnover rate. Only the rate for reoxidation of the reduced enzyme product complex was high enough to account for the observed turnover rate, which is in agreement with the proposed ternary complex mechanism (16Pollegioni L. Langkau B. Tischer W. Ghisla S. Pilone M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13850-13857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the reoxidation rate of reduced VAO was studied in the presence of vanillyl alcohol or its product vanillin, the rates of flavin reoxidation were significantly lower as compared with free-reduced enzyme (1.4 × 105 and 1.1 × 105m−1 s−1, respectively). As reduction by 4-(methoxymethyl)phenol resulted in a relatively stable reduced enzyme-intermediate complex (E red∼ Q), the rate of reoxidation of this complex was measured as well. Therefore, after reducing VAO by 4-(methoxymethyl)phenol, the reduced complex was mixed in the stopped-flow apparatus with oxygen to measure the rate of formation of oxidized enzyme. It was found that the complex readily reacted with oxygen in a fast monophasic process reoxidizing the flavin with simultaneous product formation as evidenced by the increase of absorbance at 335 nm. By varying the oxygen concentration, the second order rate constant for reoxidation of the reduced enzyme intermediate complex was estimated to be 1.5 × 105m−1 s−1. Similar values for the rate of reoxidation have been reported for other flavin-dependent oxidases (15Tan A.K. Ramsay R.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2137-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 16Pollegioni L. Langkau B. Tischer W. Ghisla S. Pilone M.S. J. Biol.

Biochimie ( Paris ). 1995; 77: 631-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The apparent turnover rate with 4-(methoxymethyl)phenol during steady-state conditions is much slower as the rate of reoxidation. Evidently, reoxidation is not determining the rate of catalysis in case of 4-(methoxymethyl)phenol, which is in agreement with the enzyme monitored turnover results. The experiments described here represent the first study on the kinetic mechanism of VAO catalyzed reactions. Furthermore, evidence is presented for the participation of p-quinone methides in the catalytic mechanism of VAO. Previously, we proposed a reaction mechanism for the conversion of eugenol by VAO, which included formation of a p-quinone methide intermediate (1Fraaije M.W. Veeger C. Van Berkel W.J.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Addition of water to this putative electrophilic intermediate would result in the formation of the product coniferyl alcohol. From isotopic labeling experiments, we have demonstrated in the present study the involvement of water during the VAO catalyzed demethylation of 4-(methoxymethyl)phenol. VAO-mediated demethylation of this physiological substrate resulted in the introduction of an oxygen atom originating from a water molecule. This indicates that during catalysis the substrate is activated, after which water can attack the Cα-atom. In contrast, with vanillyl alcohol, no oxygen atom derived from water is introduced into the aromatic product vanillin. The rapid reaction data presented in this paper showed the formation of intermediate reduced enzyme complexes during the reductive half-reaction. Anaerobic reduction of VAO by 4-(methoxymethyl)phenol revealed the formation of an eminently stable intermediate with typical spectral properties (ε364 nm = 46 mm−1 cm−1). The spectral characterisctics of the intermediate binary complex did not resemble any known flavoprotein oxidase complex. Intermediate complexes formed during catalysis of, for example, lactate monoxygenase (19Lockridge O. Massey V. Sullivan P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 8097-8106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) andd-amino acid oxidase (20Massey V. Ghisla S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1974; 227: 446Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar) have specific absorbances above 500 nm and are due to a charge transfer interaction between the reduced enzyme and product. The formation of a flavin adduct as intermediate in the reaction of VAO with 4-(methoxymethyl)phenol is rather unlikely as the spectral properties of the intermediate complex do not resemble any known flavin adduct spectrum (21Ghisla S. Massey V. Choong Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10662-10669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the spectral properties of the formed intermediate generated during the anaerobic reaction of VAO with 4-(methoxymethyl)phenol closely resembled reported spectra of several p-quinone methides of structural analogs of the phenolic substrate (λmax ∼ 360 nm, ε ∼ 40 mm−1) as obtained by chemical synthesis or flash photolysis of the corresponding phenols (22Filar L.J. Winstein S. Tetrahedron Lett. 1960; 25: 9-16Google Scholar, 23Leary G. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1972; II: 640-642Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 24Diao L. Yang C. Wan P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5369-8370Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 25Thompson D. Norbeck K. Olsson L-I. Constantin-Teodosiu D. Van Der Zee J. Moldéus P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1016-1021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Thompson D.C. Perera K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 6-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, spectra of the p-quinone methides of vanillyl alcohol and 4-(methoxymethyl)phenol have never been described. These compounds are highly unstable because of the lack of an electron donating group to stabilize the electrophilic methide carbon atom. The data presented here for VAO-mediated conversion of 4-(methoxymethyl)phenol are all consistent with formation of a p-quinone methide intermediate, which subsequently will react with water. Thep-quinone methide formed from this substrate is highly stabilized in the active site as long as the enzyme remains reduced. This suggests that the active site of the reduced enzyme intermediate complex is solvent inaccesible. Upon reoxidation of the flavin, thep-quinone methide intermediate rapidly reacts with water, indicating that during this process local structural changes occur leading to a more solvent accessible active site. Thep-quinone methide is hydrated to form the unstable hemiacetal product of 4-(methoxymethyl)phenol, which decomposes rapidly to give 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (Equation 4). The presence of reduced glutathione during turnover of 4-(methoxymethyl)phenol did not influence the stoichiometric formation of the aldehyde product, indicating that hydration of the formed p-quinone methide occurs in the enzyme active site. With vanillyl alcohol also, a transient intermediate spectrum was observed during anaerobic reduction with similar spectral characteristics as with 4-(methoxymethyl)phenol. However, with vanillyl alcohol, only half of the flavin is reduced when the maximal amount of the high absorbance intermediate is formed, indicating that the intermediate is already decomposed when the enzyme is fully reduced. When the decay of the intermediate during the second reductive phase is acknowledged, the molar absorption coefficient of the intermediate may well resemble that of the 4-(methoxymethyl)phenol p-quinone methide intermediate. The instability of the formed vanillyl alcoholp-quinone methide may well explain why during oxidation of this alcohol water is not involved in the formation of the aldehyde product. Decay of the initial intermediate formed may correspond to the autocatalytic decomposition of the vanillyl alcoholp-quinone methide leading to vanillin. The biphasic reduction can be interpreted to result from two reactive conformations of the enzyme of which one is able to reduce the flavin rapidly while the other conformation is slow in reduction. In view of this, it is worthy to note that VAO is an octamer composed of relatively stable dimers (27Fraaije M.W. Mattevi A. Van Berkel W.J.H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 33-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Another explanation for the partial reduction observed with vanillyl alcohol is a reversible reduction of the flavin by vanillyl alcohol, which results in an equilibrium of oxidized and reduced enzyme in anaerobic reduction experiments. Whenk 2 ≈ k −2, the ratio of oxidized and reduced enzyme will be 0.5, leading to an apparent partial reduction as shown in Fig. 5. The second phase observed during the reductive half-reaction might then represent product release, which would also result in total reduction of the flavin. In that case, the turnover rate for vanillyl alcohol oxidation would be determined by product release, which has also been found for several other flavoprotein oxidases (11Gibson Q.H. Swoboda B.E.P. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 3927-3934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Porter D.J.T. Voet J.G. Bright H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4464-4473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, analysis of the substrate-dependent reduction rates revealed that the reversible step of reduction must be very small (k −2 < 0.5 s−1) and is too small to explain the relatively high amount of oxidized enzyme present after the first phase of flavin reduction. Furthermore, enzyme-monitored turnover experiments showed that the enzyme is mainly in the oxidized state (91%) during steady-state turnover. As a consequence, with vanillyl alcohol, a reductive step is limiting the turnover rate also. From the rapid reaction kinetic parameters obtained in this study, it can be concluded that VAO catalyzes the oxidative demethylation of 4-(methoxymethyl)phenol via a ternary complex mechanism. Also, the parallel lines pattern of Lineweaver-Burk plots found for the steady-state kinetics are in accordance with a ternary complex mechanism as k −2 is negligibly small andk 3 is relatively large (Table I). Becausek 5 is very small, only a small portion of enzyme will react via a ping-pong mechanism as represented by the left cycle in Scheme I. From single turnover experiments, it could be deduced that the rate of flavin reduction, i.e. formation of the binary complex (k 2 = 3.3 s−1), is by far the rate determining step in catalysis (k cat = 3.1 s−1). The enzyme-monitored turnover results are also consistent with the proposed kinetic mechanism. When the formation of the Michaelis-Menten complex is a relatively fast process (at infinite substrate concentrations), the ratio of enzyme in the oxidized state during steady-state can be calculated by the following. EoxEtotal=(1/k2)+(1/k4)(1/k2)+(1/k3)+(1/k4)Equation 5 For 4-(methoxymethyl)phenol, the calculated ratio is 0.92 (k 2 = 3.0 s−1 at 500 μm), which compares quite well with the experimental obtained value of 0.86. This indicates that the mechanism-based calculated rate of product release (k 4 = 50 s−1) is a reasonable approximation. Taken together, the kinetic data are consistent with a ternary complex mechanism including (right cycle of Scheme I) 1) formation of a Michaelis-Menten complex, 2) flavin reduction and synchronous formation of the reduced enzyme intermediate complex, 3) reoxidation of the reduced enzyme complex by molecular oxygen with the concomitant conversion of the intermediate to form the final product, and 4) product release completing the catalytic cycle. Although a ternary complex mechanism is operative with 4-(methoxymethyl)phenol, with vanillyl alcohol, the reaction may also follow a ping-pong mechanism (represented by the left cycle in Scheme I). With this substrate, the binary reduced enzyme intermediate complex readily decomposes to form product without prior reoxidation of the flavin. In both cases, the rate of substrate-mediated flavin reduction is mainly limiting the overall rate of catalysis. From the results presented in this study, it can be concluded that VAO efficiently converts the transient formed p-quinone methides. Quinone methides are highly electrophilic compounds and are thought to be involved in several toxicological processes. Studies have shown that formation of analogous quinone methides can result in (cyto)toxic effects by forming covalent bonds with cellular nucleophiles like proteins or DNA (25Thompson D. Norbeck K.

Preliminary release of the reactive product intermediate formed by VAO would also result in spontaneous reactions with water or other nucleophiles and could, therefore in vivo, elicit possible deleterious effects. Clearly, efficient hydration of the p-quinone methide in the active site of the enzyme is a prerequisite for the microorganism to exclude potential toxic effects. We thank Dr. N. C. M.

In this study, we have heterologously overexpressed and purified CrtJ to homogeneity and shown by gel mobility shift assays that CrtJ is biologically active. DNase I footprint analysis confirms molecular genetic studies by showing that CrtJ binds to conserved palindromic sequences that overlap the −10 and −35 promoter regions of the bchC operon. Graphs of the percentage of DNA bound versus protein concentration show sigmoidal curves, which is highly indicative of cooperative binding of CrtJ to the two palindromic sites. A binding constant for interaction of CrtJ with the palindrome that spans the −10 region was calculated to be 4.8 × 10−9m, whereas affinity for the palindrome that spans the −35 region was found to be 2.9 × 10−9m. Binding of CrtJ to the bchCpromoter region was also found to be redox-sensitive, with CrtJ exhibiting a 4.5-fold higher binding affinity under oxidizingversus reducing conditions.

Rhodobacter capsulatus is a purple nonsulfur photosynthetic bacterium that regulates synthesis of its photosynthetic apparatus in response to alterations in oxygen tension and light intensity. Oxygen tension at atmospheric levels (21%) results in virtual suppression of photopigment production, whereas reduced oxygen tension (<1%) promotes cellular differentiation that results in the formation of an intracellular membrane that houses the light-driven energy-generating photosystem (1Cohen-Bazire G. Sistrom W.R. Stanier R.Y. J. Cell. Comp. Physiol. 1957; 49: 25-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar). Oxygen regulation of photosystem synthesis is known to be controlled, in part, by regulating transcription of photosynthesis genes (reviewed in Refs. 2Bauer C.E. Blankenship R.E. Madigan M.T.

One regulatory circuit, RegB-RegA, is a phosphorylation cascade responsible for anaerobic activation of light harvesting and reaction center structural genes that are coded by the puf,puh, and puc operons. RegB is a histidine kinase that initiates a phosphorylation cascade when the cells are growing in an anaerobic environment (4Inoue K. Kouadio J.L. Mosley C.S. Bauer C.E.

In a previous study, we observed that disruption of an open reading frame termed crtJ (ORF469) resulted in the aerobic production of photopigments (7Bollivar D.W. Suzuki J.Y. Beatty J.T. Dobrowlski J. Bauer C.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 622-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Genetic and transcriptional studies have indicated that crtJ appears to code for an aerobic repressor of bacteriochlorophyll (bch), carotenoid (crt), and light harvesting-II (puc) gene expression (8Penfold R.J.

We also observed that cell-free extracts derived from wild type R. capsulatus cells are able to promote the formation of a stable gel mobility shift with abchC promoter fragment, whereas extracts from acrtJ-disrupted strain were unable to do so (11Ponnampalam S.N. Buggy J.J. Bauer C.E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2990-2997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gel shift (11Ponnampalam S.N. Buggy J.J. Bauer C.E. J.

Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2037-2045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), have indicated that CrtJ is most likely interacting with a conserved palindrome (gTGT-N12-ACAc) that is present in the CrtJ-regulatedbch, crt, and puc promoters. However, direct proof that CrtJ recognizes the conserved palindrome sequence has not been demonstrated. In this study, we have heterologously overexpressed and purified CrtJ to homogeneity. Gel mobility and DNase I protection analysis were utilized to demonstrate that CrtJ indeed binds to a conserved palindrome sequence that is present in two copies of thebchC promoter. We also demonstrate that binding of CrtJ to the bchC promoter is affected by the redox state of the binding buffer. Strain NM522 was used for routine cloning procedures. For overexpression of CrtJ, strain BL21(DE3) was utilized (13Sauer, R. T. (1979) Molecular Characterization of the Repressor and Its Gene cI. Ph.D. thesis, Harvard University.Google Scholar).

Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Ampicillin and kanamycin were used at 100 and 30 μg/ml, respectively. CrtJ was expressed in Escherichia coli using a T7 RNA polymerase-based overexpression system that appended the amino terminus of CrtJ with a His6 tag (Novagen). For this construction, the CrtJ coding region (14,821–16,209 base pairs of the photosynthesis gene cluster; Ref. 20Alberti M. Burke D.E. Hearst J.E. Blankenship R.E. Madigan M.T. Bauer C.E. Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria.

The upstream and downstream oligonucleotide primers, 5′CCCATATGCGACGGGAGGCCTTGCA and 5′CCTCTAGAACGGTCCTGGAGCAGGCGTT, respectively, were designed to contain an NdeI restriction site at thecrtJ start codon and an XbaI site at the stop codon (underlined bases). The PCR-amplified fragment was subsequently cloned into SmaI-digested pUC19 and then subcloned into theNdeI-HindIII restriction sites of pET28(a)(+) (Novagen), resulting in the recombinant plasmid, pET28::CrtJ. The expression plasmid pET28::CrtJ was transformed into the pT7 RNA polymerase expression strain BL21(DE3), and CrtJ was then expressed to high levels by isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) induction as described previously (16Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6003) Google Scholar, 17Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar). The cell pellet from a 100-ml culture was then resuspended in 4 ml of ice-cold binding buffer composed of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 5 mmimidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and the cells were then disrupted by sonication. The lysate was then clarified by centrifugation at 39,000 × g for 20 min with the supernatant further clarified by filtration through a 0.45-μm membrane (Gelman Sciences) to prevent clogging of the resin during column chromatography. Purification of His6-appended CrtJ was performed using nickel column affinity chromatography as described by the resin manufacture (Novagen). Fractions containing the highest CrtJ concentrations as visualized by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were pooled, yielding a typical concentration of 0.30 mg/ml and dialyzed overnight in 1 liter of buffer composed of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 50 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, and 20% glycerol. The purified protein was then partitioned into 30-μl aliquots, subjected to rapid freezing using a dry ice/ethanol mixture, and stored at −70 °C. PCR amplification and purification of a 32P-labeled DNA probe containing the bchCpromoter region was prepared as described by Ponnampalam et al. (11Ponnampalam S.N. Buggy J.J. Bauer C.E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2990-2997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For determination if purified CrtJ was active, a gel mobility shift assay was performed that compared DNA binding properties of purified CrtJ with that of a crude lysate that was prepared as described by Ponnampalam et al. (11Ponnampalam S.N. Buggy J.J. Bauer C.E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2990-2997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For this analysis, 3 μl of 32P-end-labeled bchC DNA probe (10 fmol/3 μl) was added to 2.5 μl of poly(dI·dC) nonspecific competitor DNA (0.20 μg/μl). The DNA solution was then added to a 15-μl reaction containing either purified CrtJ protein (0.50–1.0 μg) or crude lysate (2 μg) in a reaction buffer composed of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.1, 50 mm potassium acetate, 20% glycerol (v/v). Each reaction was then incubated for 20 min at 30 °C, loaded on a native 6% Tris-glycine-EDTA-buffered polyacrylamide gel, and electrophoresed at 16 mA for 2.5 h at 4 °C. To ascertain if DNA binding of purified CrtJ is redox-sensitive, purified CrtJ was diluted into a 30-μl reaction buffer containing 9 fmol of 32P-end-labeled bchC DNA probe and 3 μl of a 10 mg/ml heparin solution. To facilitate the transport of electrons from the oxidizing/reducing agent to the protein center, 1.5 μl of ethanol and 1.0 μl of water-soluble redox mediators were also added to the mix (21Silverstein T. Cheng L.L. Allen J.F. Biochim. Biophys. 1993; 1183: 215-220Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The ethanol-soluble mediators used were 1,4-benzoquinone (2.5 μg/ml),N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylphenylenediamine (3.0 μg/ml), diaminodurene (12 μg/ml), 1,2-naphthoquinone (3.0 μg/ml), 5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (3.0 μg/ml), duroquinone (4.0 μg/ml), 2,5-dihydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone (3.5 μg/ml), anthraquinone (saturated), and 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (3.0 μg/ml). The water-soluble mediators used were phenazine methosulfate (7.0 μg/ml), anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (7.5 μg/ml), anthraquinone-2-sulfonate (7.5 μg/ml), benzyl viologen (1.0 μg/ml), and methyl viologen (1.0 μg/ml). The protein samples were incubated for 30 min on ice in the presence of 10 mm sodium dithionite, argon gas, oxygen gas, or 20 mm potassium ferricyanide. Oxygen gas was bubbled through the sample continuously for 5 min. Argon gas was bubbled through the protein sample alternately with degassing by vacuum several times prior to addition of argon. After the 30-min redox incubation period, 3 μl of 32P-end-labeled probe (10 fmol) was added to the samples, which were then incubated for an additional 20 min at 30 °C. 3 μl of heparin (10 μg/ml) was then added as a competitor, and the samples were then electrophoresed at 4 °C as described above. A 183-base pair DNA segment containing the bchCXYZ promoter region was obtained by PCR amplification using oligonucleotide primers 5′-GTTCGGACCCGGCTTTGACC and 5′-TTCACCAAGGTGTCGAAACCG with amplification conditions as described for the gel mobility shift assays. For selective labeling of DNA strands, one of the primers in the PCR reaction was 5′-32P-end-labeled prior to amplification. The amplified segment was purified as described for the gel mobility shift assay. Binding of purified CrtJ to the DNA fragment prior to DNase I digestion involved conditions similar to those described for the gel shift assays with the reaction mix composition containing 4 μl of end-labeled DNA (12 fmol), 82 μl of gel mobility shift buffer, and 9 μl of CrtJ at varying concentrations. After incubating the binding reaction at 30 °C for 20 min, DNase I (0.50 μg/ml) was added to the mixture, and the digestion was allowed to proceed for 2 min at room temperature. The reaction was then stopped by the addition of 100 μl of DNase I stop solution and electrophoresed on a 5% urea-denaturing Long Ranger polyacrylamide gel as described previously (22Bauer C.E. Hesse S.D. Gumport R.I. Gardner J.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 513-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A modified Maxam and Gilbert G + A chemical sequencing reaction was used for determining the location of DNase I protection (23Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9013) Google Scholar). EC50 values for CrtJ binding to the bchC promoter region were calculated using a modified method of Brenowitz et al. (24Brenowitz M. Senear D.F. Shea M.A. Ackers G.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8462-8466Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Briefly, CrtJ DNA binding isotherms to the bchC promoter region were generated by DNase I footprint titration assays using 2-fold protein dilutions ranging from 4 ng to 4 μg. The gel was then analyzed for CrtJ binding isotherms using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) to quantitate the level of CrtJ protection of a single band in the upstream and downstream palindromes. Values were corrected for loading by normalization with a band from an unprotected region. Nitrocellulose filter binding assays according to the method of Witherell and Uhlenbeck (25Witherell G.W. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), were utilized to determine the fraction of isolated CrtJ that was active in DNA binding, the level of which was then used to correct the EC50 values for CrtJ binding to the bchC promoter region. For this determination, 1.2 pmol (62.5 ng) of purified CrtJ was incubated with varying amounts (from 0.04 to 3.65 pmol) of 32P-labeled bchC DNA probe that was identical to the probe used for the DNase I footprint titration assay. The sample volume used for each reaction was 30 μl consisting of 10 μl of DNA sample (of varying dilutions), 5 μl of heparin (100 μg/ml), 9 μl of CrtJ (1.2 pmol), and 6 μl of binding buffer. The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min and then filtered through 0.45-μm pore size, pure nitrocellulose filters (number 9138/2, Schleicher and Schuell), which had been previously soaked in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm potassium acetate, and 20% glycerol) for 2 h at room temperature. The filtration time was relatively rapid, with most of the filtrate passing through the nitrocellulose filter within 60 s. The filters were then air-dried for 30 min and counted in a Packard scintillation counter (model Tri-Carb 2100TR) using Bio-Safe II Biodegradable Counting Mixture (Research Products International Corporation). Retention efficiencies for the 32P-labeled DNA calculated as the number of counts retained on the nitrocellulose filter compared with the number of counts retained on the filter at saturating levels of the protein ranged from 60 to 95%. A control assay was also done in which no protein was added to the varying amounts of DNA used to ascertain the background level of DNA that bound to the nitrocellulose filter. The Hill coefficient was determined by using a nonlinear regression analysis to fit the Hill equation given by y = a/1 + (x/E) −n, where a is the maximum value of y as x approaches infinity,y corresponds to the fractional occupancy of the binding site on the DNA molecule, x is the protein concentration (nM), E is the EC50 value, which corresponds to half-maximal saturation of each binding site, andn is the Hill coefficient. The Hill coefficients for the binding of CrtJ to both the upstream and downstream palindromes were obtained from a DNase I footprint titration assay from which site binding isotherms were generated. The Hill coefficients were then determined from a graph of fractional saturation versusprotein concentration. A His-tagged version of CrtJ was overexpressed in E. coli using a T7-based overexpression system. As demonstrated by the SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis polypeptide profile in Fig.1, IPTG-based induction of T7 RNA polymerase resulted in high level overexpression of CrtJ, which was predominantly found in the soluble fraction (lane 3). CrtJ was subsequently isolated to a high level of purity (>95% as judged by Coomassie Blue staining;lane 4) by affinity binding of the His6-tagged CrtJ to a Ni2+ column. Gel retardation (mobility shift) assays were subsequently performed to ascertain if isolated CrtJ was active. As a control, we performed a gel retardation assay with crude cell lysates obtained from wild type and CrtJ-disrupted R. capsulatus cells. In confirmation of previous results (11Ponnampalam S.N. Buggy J.J. Bauer C.E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2990-2997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we observed that a DNA fragment that contains the bchC promoter region was shifted to a reduced electrophoretic mobility when incubated with the wild type extract (Fig. 2, lane 2). This mobility shift is absent in extracts derived from the crtJ-disrupted strain DB469 (lane 3), suggesting that the mobility shift observed with the wild type extract resulted from an interaction of CrtJ with the bchC promoter region. This supposition is supported by mobility shifts obtained with increasing concentrations of purified CrtJ (lanes 4–6) that has an electrophoretic mobility identical to that observed with wild type crude extracts. These results indicate that heterologously expressed CrtJ was isolated in a properly folded form and that it has specificity for a sequence within thebchC promoter region. DNase I protection (footprint) analysis of CrtJ binding to the bchC promoter region was performed on both DNA strands by selectively 5′-end labeling either the top or bottom strand. As seen from the DNase I digestion patterns in Fig. 3, CrtJ protects a region of the top strand ranging from −3 to −52 and on the bottom strand from −1 to −49. Inspection of the protected DNA sequence (Fig. 3) indicates that this region contains two copies of the palindromic sequence TGT-N4-TCAA-N3-ACA, one of which flanks the −10 and the other the −35 region of thebchC promoter (11Ponnampalam S.N. Buggy J.J. Bauer C.E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2990-2997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Ma D. Cook D.N. O'Brien D.A. Hearst J.E. J.

A. 1986; 83: 8462-8466Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Several sites hypersensitive to DNase I digestion are also observed on the top and bottom strands (Figs. 3 and 4). These hypersensitive strands extend 36 base pairs upstream and 58 base pairs downstream from the region of CrtJ protection.Figure 4Summary of the top and bottom strand protection patterns of CrtJ binding to the bchC promoter region.

Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), which involves quantitating the amount of maximal DNA probe bound with a known amount of protein. If the oligomerization state of the protein bound to the DNA probe is known, then it is possible to calculate the percentage of fraction of protein that is active. For our analysis, the CrtJ protein concentration was held constant at 1.2 pm (at approximately half saturation) with the 32P-labeled bchC DNA probe varied in the vicinity of the protein (CrtJ) concentration. As shown in the DNA titration curve in Fig. 5, the amount of DNA bound by the filter rises to a saturation point of 0.11 pmol of DNA (note that this value has been corrected for the efficiency of probe retention by the filter as described under “Materials and Methods”). Assuming that the DNA probe maximally binds to the filter when both palindromes are fully occupied and that two CrtJ bind per palindrome for a total of four CrtJ/probe, then at saturating levels of input DNA bound (0.11 pmol) there must be 0.44 pmol of protein bound by the filter. Thus, the fraction of protein that is active corresponds to 0.44 pmol of protein retained by the filter/1.2 pmol of input protein in the assay, which corresponds to an active protein fraction of 36.7%. Binding isotherms for interactions of CrtJ to each of the individual palindromes were determined using a DNase I footprint titration assay according to the method of Brenowitz et al.(24Brenowitz M. Senear D.F. Shea M.A. Ackers G.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8462-8466Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). This method involves quantitating, by PhosphorImager analysis, CrtJ-mediated protection of a DNase I digestion site in each of the palindromes using small increments of CrtJ and correcting for background. The optical density ratios are then converted to fractional protection values. However, because even at saturating levels of protein, the DNA is not completely protected from DNase I digestion, the fractional protection values have to be converted to fractional saturation values. The fractional saturation values are then plotted against the logarithm of the protein concentration (Fig.6). As shown in Fig. 6, CrtJ protection of the upstream (−21 to −52) and downstream (−1 to −20) palindromes exhibits sigmoidal curves of protection with an average Hill coefficient of 2.5 for each binding site. Since the Hill coefficient is greater than 2, it indicates that there are cooperative interactions among three or more protein subunits that are binding to the two palindromic binding sites. This further supports the hypothesis that CrtJ binds in a multimeric form, possibly as a dimer to each palindromic site and that tetramerization of these dimers induces a cooperative interaction (see “Discussion”). From the fractional saturation values, we can also determine an EC50 value for binding of CrtJ to the upstream and downstream palindromes. The values obtained, after correcting for 37% active protein, are values of 2.9 × 10−9m for binding to the upstream palindrome and 4.8 × 10−9m for binding to the downstream palindrome. Since previous genetic analysis indicated that CrtJ most likely functions as an aerobic repressor (11Ponnampalam S.N. Buggy J.J. Bauer C.E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2990-2997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we next addressed whether binding of CrtJ to the bchC promoter was affected by alterations in the redox state of the binding buffer. For this analysis, we first preincubated CrtJ for 30 min in the presence of a binding buffer that contained soluble redox mediators (to facilitate the transport of electrons from the oxidizing/reducing agent to the protein center) (22Bauer C.E. Hesse S.D. Gumport R.I. Gardner J.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 513-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) as well as various oxidizing/reducing agents. After preincubation, a 32P-end-labeled bchC DNA probe was added to the samples, incubated for an additional 20 min, and then subjected to gel electrophoresis. As shown in the gel shift assays in Fig. 7, preincubation of CrtJ in the presence of a binding buffer that was saturated with oxygen (by bubbling molecular oxygen into the binding buffer) or 20 mm potassium ferricyanide, which have redox values of approximately +800 and +450 mV, respectively, promoted excellent binding conditions. In contrast, preincubation of CrtJ under conditions where oxygen was replaced with the redox neutral gas argon or with 10 mm of the strong reducing reagent sodium dithionite (approximately −600 mV) resulted in a significant reduction of binding activity. Three separate reactions were performed to determine if the observed redox response was reversible. In the first reaction, CrtJ was incubated separately with either 10 mm sodium dithionite or 20 mm potassium ferricyanide for 1 h. In a second reaction, CrtJ was first incubated for half an hour with 10 mm sodium dithionite, an excess of potassium ferricyanide (20 mm) was added, and then the reaction was incubated for a further 30 min. As shown in Fig. 8, the inhibitory effect of reducing conditions is indeed reversible, since the addition of the excess potassium ferricyanide to the CrtJ sample that had been inhibited with dithionite promoted the formation of a stable DNA-protein complex in the gel mobility shift assay (lanes 8and 9). Thus, CrtJ appears to be capable of sensing environmental redox values and adjusting binding accordingly. We next performed gel mobility shift assays with small increments (0.05–0.10 μg) of CrtJ to generate binding isotherms for the determination of EC50 values (effective concentration of CrtJ for 50% response) of CrtJ binding to the bchC promoter region under varying redox conditions. Cooperative binding of CrtJ to the two palindromic sites of the bchC promoter region is also revealed when the percentage of DNA bound is plotted against protein concentration. Sigmoidal curves were obtained indicating cooperativity between the two binding sites (Fig. 9). The EC50 value for CrtJ binding to the bchCpromoter region indicates that CrtJ binding affinity for thebchC promoter increases 4.5-fold under oxidizingversus reducing conditions (Table I). The corrected EC50 values for binding of CrtJ to thebchC promoter region (Table I), as based on gel mobility shifts (the values of which were corrected for percentage of active fraction and for the binding of four CrtJ/promoter fragment), indicates that binding to the promoter fragment is 6.0 × 10−9m under oxidizing conditions (oxygen) and 2.7 × 10−8m under reducing conditions (sodium dithionite). Intermediate EC50 values were obtained for less severe oxidizing/reducing conditions. These values are 8.4 × 10−9m and 1.9 × 10−8m for potassium ferricyanide and argon, respectively (TableI).Table IBinding constants between DNA and purified CrtJ under various redox conditions as calculated by gel mobility shift analysisRedox reagentEC50Corrected EC50 valueμmmOxygen0.0656.0 × 10−9Potassium ferricyanide0.0928.4 × 10−9Argon0.211.9 × 10−8Sodium dithionite0.292.7 × 10−8 Open table in a new tab Our results demonstrate that highly purified His-tagged CrtJ can be readily isolated in an active form by a one-step purification using a Ni2+ charged column. The isolated protein is active as evidenced from gel mobility shift assays where purified CrtJ shows an identical shift with that of the crude lysate of wild type R. capsulatus cells and by the results of our DNase I footprint titration assays. The protection pattern of CrtJ binding to both the top and bottom strands of the bchC promoter region shows an area of protection extending approximately 52 base pairs from −1 to −51. This region contains two conserved palindromic sequences TGT-N12-ACA that are centered around the ς70-like promoter sequences present at the −35 and −10 regions of the bchC operon (11Ponnampalam S.N. Buggy J.J. Bauer C.E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2990-2997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Ma D. Cook D.N. O'Brien D.A. Hearst J.E. J.

Recognition of this palindrome by CrtJ is also supported by prior mutational analysis, which indicated that they were involved in the binding of an aerobic repressor (12Ma D. Cook D.N. O'Brien D.A. Hearst J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2037-2045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence at hand indicates that cooperative interactions occur between CrtJ bound at the two palindromes. Cooperativity is indicated by the formation of sigmoidal curves and by the Hill coefficient obtained for CrtJ binding to the two palindromic sites, which indicates that this interaction involves more than 2.5 CrtJ polypeptides. We also have unpublished data that indicates that CrtJ binds very poorly to DNA segments that contain only one of the two identified bchCpalindromes. 2S. Ponnampalam and C. Bauer, unpublished results. Given well characterized interactions observed among other prokaryotic transcription factors such as the λcI repressor, the nitrogen regulator NtrC, and the lacI repressor in E. coli (27Ptashne M. A Genetic Switch: Gene Control and Phage λ. Cell and Blackwell Scientific Publications, Cambridge, MA1986: 87-93Google Scholar, 28Weiss V. Claverie-Martin F. Magasanik B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 1996; 271: 1247-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar), the most likely scenario is that CrtJ binds as a dimer to each of the palindromes and that the dimers cooperatively interact to form stable tetramers. The EC50 values of CrtJ binding to the bchCpromoter region under oxidizing conditions is 6.0 × 10−9m, as based on gel mobility shift results, which is the same order of magnitude as that of the λcI repressor binding to the right operator site, OR1 (under “physiological conditions”, cI repressor has a K d of 3 × 10−9m for OR1 (13Sauer, R.

This value is, however, several orders of magnitude lower than that observed for other repressors, such as the lac repressor, which has a binding affinity of 10−12m (32Lin S. Riggs A.D. Cell. 1975; 4: 107-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The modest affinity of CrtJ binding to the bchC promoter may reflect the fact that CrtJ-regulated promoters are only moderately repressed (1.5–2-fold) by CrtJ (11Ponnampalam S.N. Buggy J.J. Bauer C.E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2990-2997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Ma D. Cook D.N. O'Brien D.A. Hearst J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2037-2045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is contrasted by the 1,000-fold (32Lin S. Riggs A.D. Cell. 1975; 4: 107-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) repression exhibited by the lac repressor. Since previous genetic analysis indicated that CrtJ functions as an aerobic repressor (8Penfold R.J. Pemberton J.M. Curr. Microbiol. 1991; 23: 259-263Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 9Penfold R.J. Pemberton J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2869-2876Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Gomelsky M. Kaplan S. J.

O'Brien D.A. Hearst J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2037-2045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it was perhaps not surprising to find that CrtJ binds to the bchC DNA fragment better under oxidizingversus reducing conditions. The calculated EC50value of CrtJ binding to the bchC promoter region under oxidizing conditions is 4.5-fold higher than that observed under reducing conditions, suggesting that CrtJ may have redox sensing capabilities. The effect of altering the redox state on CrtJ binding is reversible, suggesting that reducing conditions are not nonspecifically affecting DNA binding activity. Furthermore, CrtJ binding is best under highly oxidizing conditions (such as oxygen-saturated binding buffer), which is a condition that inhibits binding of other redox-responding DNA binding proteins such as FNR, DtxR, SoxR, and Fur. These latter redox-responding proteins have oxygen-labile iron or iron-sulfur clusters that are required for optimal DNA binding capabilities (32Lin S. Riggs A.D.

Schmitt M.P. Holmes R.K. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 1600-1608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the redox-sensing component within CrtJ is yet to be elucidated, we feel that it is unlikely to have a redox-responding iron center. Inspection of the CrtJ sequence indicates no obvious Cys-rich iron binding motifs such as that found in iron binding transcription factors. Atomic absorption spectrometry and EPR of isolated CrtJ also shows no significant levels of iron in the isolated protein preparations.2 A recent study by Gomelsky and Kaplan (41Gomelsky M. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 128-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) indicates that in Rhodobacter sphaeroides a second protein (AppA) may also be involved in controlling redox-sensitive binding by CrtJ. Although no experimental evidence has been obtained for a function for AppA in controlling CrtJ activity, it is possible that AppA may be sensing redox and somehow transmitting this information to CrtJ. A homolog for AppA in R. capsulatus has not yet been described, so at this time we are unable to biochemically ascertain whether AppA affects the in vitro redox response of CrtJ DNA binding. Finally, there are several studies that indicate that CrtJ may be a global repressor of pigment biosynthesis genes and that its presence is conserved in diverse species of anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria. For example, sequence and genetic analysis of the R. capsulatusphotosynthesis gene cluster indicates the presence of similar palindromic motifs within putative promoter sequences for bacteriochlorophyll, carotenoid, and light harvesting-II structural genes (2Bauer C.E.

Thus, any insights into the mechanism of redox responsiveness of CrtJ binding to photosystem promoters could also provide insight into how these additional organisms control photosystem development.

It is transiently expressed in several condensing mesenchymal tissues after epithelial induction. In this study we evaluated the expression of syndecan-1 during skeletal muscle differentiation. The expression of syndecan-1 as determined by Northern blot analyses and immunofluorescence microscopy is down-regulated during differentiation. The transcriptional activity of a syndecan-1 promoter construct is also down-regulated in differentiating muscle cells. The decrease in syndecan-1 gene expression is not dependent on the presence of E-boxes, binding sites for the MyoD family of transcription factors in the promoter region, or myogenin expression. Deletion of the region containing the E-boxes or treatment of differentiating cells with sodium butyrate, an inhibitor of myogenin expression, had no effect on syndecan-1 expression. Basic fibroblast growth factor and transforming growth factor type β, which are inhibitors of myogenesis, had little effect on syndecan-1 expression. When added together, however, they induced syndecan-1 expression. Retinoic acid, an inducer of myogenesis, inhibited syndecan-1 expression and abolished the effect of the growth factors.

Heparan sulfate is present on the cell surface of most, if not all, adherent cells in the form of heparan sulfate proteoglycans. The best characterized cell surface proteoglycans are the syndecans, a family of transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycans that are implicated in a variety of interactions with the pericellular microenvironment (for review, see Refs. 1Bernfield M.

Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2975-2982PubMed Google Scholar). The first member of this family to be discovered, syndecan-1, is a hybrid proteoglycan bearing both heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycans (3Rapraeger A. Jalkanen M. Endo E. Koda J. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11046-11052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This proteoglycan binds a variety of extracellular matrix constituents, such as fibronectin (4Saunders S. Bernfield M. J.

Syndecan-1 has been suggested to be a morphoregulatory molecule because its expression during embryonic development is dynamically regulated and corresponds to morphological boundaries (9Sutherland A.E. Sanderson R.D. Mayes M. Seibert M. Calaarco P.G. Bernfield M. Damsky C. Development. 1991; 113: 339-351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Changes in syndecan-1 expression correlate with morphologic changes during interactions between epithelial and mesenchymal cells in tooth (10Vainio S. Jalkanen M. Vaahtokari A. Sahlberg C. Mali M.

Biol. 1990; 140: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) development. The molecular mechanisms that regulate syndecan expression are only beginning to be explored. Sequences upstream of the first exon of murine syndecan-1 gene have promoter activity. This region contains an array of consensus transcription factors binding sites (14Hinkes M.T. Goldberger O.A. Neumann P.E. Kokenyesi R. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11440-11448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These sites, which include Antennapedia, NF-κB, SP1 (GC and GT box), TATA and CAAT boxes, and five E-boxes (CANNTG), provide potential mechanisms for regulation of syndecan-1 expression. Skeletal muscle cells are a useful model for studying cell differentiation. The fusion of mononucleated myoblasts to form multinucleated myotubes is a central event in skeletal muscle development. The onset and progression of this process are controlled by a complex set of interactions between myoblasts and their environment. Some of the regulatory proteins that control this process have been identified. Thus, when myogenesis begins, myogenic regulatory genes of the MyoD family (myogenin, mrf5, mrf4) are activated (15Emerson C.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 1065-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These factors bind to specific DNA consensus sites called E-boxes, which function as transcriptional enhancers of muscle differentiation genes (for review, see Ref. 16Lundolph D.C. Konieczy S.F. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1595-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Recent data suggest that factors of the MEF2 family are also required to specify muscle fate or to direct muscle differentiation (17Molkentin J.D. Black B.L. Martin J.F. Olson E.N. Cell. 1995; 83: 1125-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). The expression and activity of these master genes are regulated by polypeptide growth factors including bFGF (18Brunetti A. Goldfine I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5960-5963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) (19Brennan T.J. Edmondson D.G. Li L. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3822-3826Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and insulin-like growth factor (20Tollefsen S.E. Lajara R. McCusker R.H. Clemmons D.R. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13810-13817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as by retinoic acid (RA) (21Halevy O. Lerman O. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 154: 566-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). One or more of these growth factors, when present at high levels, hold myoblasts in the undifferentiated state (for review, see Ref. 22Yun K. Wold B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 877-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), whereas RA induces myoblast differentiation (21Halevy O. Lerman O. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 154: 566-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that heparan sulfate proteoglycans are necessary for the modulation of terminal myogenesis (23Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Science. 1991; 251: 1705-1708Crossref Scopus (1291) Google Scholar), probably by acting as low affinity receptor for bFGF (24Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M.

Biochem. 1993; 216: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar,27Brandan E. Carey D.J. Larraı́n J. Melo F. Campos A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 71: 170-176PubMed Google Scholar) and perlecan (28Larraı́n, J., Alvarez, J., Hassell, J. R., and Brandan, E. (1997) Exp. Cell Res., in press.Google Scholar) varies during skeletal muscle differentiation of the C2C12 myoblast cell line. Syndecan-1 is expressed transiently during limb development (13Solursh M. Reiter R.S. Jensen K.L. Kato M. Bernfield M. Dev. Biol. 1990; 140: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) but is absent in adult skeletal muscle (29Saunders S. Jalkanen M. O'Farrel S. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1547-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), making this proteoglycan a good candidate for modulation of bFGF signaling during myoblast differentiation. The presence of E-boxes in the syndecan-1 promoter has led to the suggestion that MyoD or a related protein binds to these sites to cause down-regulation of syndecan-1 expression. The decrease in syndecan-1 expression would attenuate bFGF signaling and promote differentiation of myoblasts (30Bernfield, M., Hinkes, M. T., and Gallo, R. L. (1993)Development (suppl.) 205–212.Google Scholar). In this study we show that expression of syndecan-1 is down-regulated during skeletal muscle differentiation of C2C12myoblasts but by a myogenin- and E-box-independent pathway. Syndecan-1 expression is controlled by a proximal region of the promoter which contains putative SP1, NF-κB, and RA response element binding sites and is strongly influenced by bFGF, TGF-β, and RA. The mouse skeletal muscle cell line C2C12 (31Yaffe D. Saxel O. Nature. 1977; 270: 725-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (1563) Google Scholar) was grown as described by Brandanet al. (32Brandan E. Fuentes M.E. Andrade W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 55: 209-216PubMed Google Scholar). Three days after plating (80% confluence), the medium was changed to differentiation medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% horse serum). Two days later, 0.1 mm cytosine-β-d-arabinofuranoside was added to the culture medium. Thereafter the incubation medium was changed daily. NMuMG mouse mammary epithelial cells and C3H10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts (ATCC) were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) as described (33Elenius K. Määttä A. Salmivirta M. Jalkanen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6435-6441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For experiments, cells were plated at equal density and grow to 60–70% confluence. Total RNA was isolated from cell cultures at the indicated times by guanidium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform extraction and isopropyl alcohol precipitation using RNAzol B (Cinna/Biotecx Laboratories, Inc., Houston, TX) (34Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63190) Google Scholar). RNA samples (15 μg/lane) were electrophoresed through 1.2% agarose/formaldehyde gels, transferred to Nylon membranes (Sigma), and hybridized with probes for myogenin, syndecan-1, and creatine kinase. The probes were prepared as follows. For myogenin, a conserved 672-bp fragment of human myogenin cDNA was amplified by PCR (35Melo F. Carey D.J. Brandan E. J. Cell Biochem. 1996; 62: 227-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). For syndecan-1 and creatine kinase a fragment of 529 bp (from 1505 to 2033 in the cDNA) and 486 bp from 389 to 874 in the cDNA), respectively, were amplified by reverse transcriptase PCR from total RNA obtained from C2C12 cells. Blots were hybridized with random primed labeled probes in a buffer containing 1.0 m NaCl, 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 10% dextran sulfate, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon testes DNA at 65 °C overnight. Hybridized membranes were washed twice at 65 °C in 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate for 5 min and exposed to Kodak x-ray film. Cells to be analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy were grown on glass coverslips, as described previously (27Brandan E. Carey D.J. Larraı́n J. Melo F. Campos A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 71: 170-176PubMed Google Scholar). For cell surface staining the live unfixed cells were incubated in the first antibody solution (1:20 of affinity-purified anti-syndecan-1 (36Carey D. Stahl R.C. Cizmeci-Smith G. Asundi V.K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) in 5% non-fat milk, 0.1m sodium chloride, 0.02 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.4) for 30 min on ice. After removing this solution the cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde, and the bound antibodies were detected by incubating the cells with affinity-purified Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibodies. Nuclei were stained by incubating the cells in 0.1 μg/ml DAPI, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mNaCl for 20 min. After rinsing, the slides were viewed with a Nikon upright microscope equipped for epifluorescence. Conditioned medium from approximately 6 × 108 cells was concentrated in a Q-Sepharose column (Sigma) (2.5 × 15 cm) equilibrated with 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4. After application of the conditioned medium the column was washed with the equilibration buffer until theA 280 of the effluent was 0. Bound proteins were eluted with the same buffer containing 1.0 m NaCl until phenol red was eluted. After dialysis against the equilibration buffer the sample was subjected to high performance liquid chromatography on a 7.5 × 75-mm column of DEAE (Beckman Spherogel TSK DEAE-5PW) equilibrated with the same buffer. The bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 1 m NaCl in the equilibration buffer at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. For immunoblot analysis aliquots were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis in 7.5% polyacrylamide gels, electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and stained with affinity-purified rabbit anti-syndecan-1 antibodies (36Carey D. Stahl R.C. Cizmeci-Smith G. Asundi V.K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Plasmids were purified by Wizard™ Plus Maxiprep kits (Promega). The cells were plated in growth medium 1 day before transfection at a density of 8,000/cm2 in 60-mm plates (Corning). For transfection the cells were incubated for 6 h with Opti-MEM I (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 5 μg of plasmid DNA and 20 μg of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). After transfection the cells were incubated for 14 h in Opti-MEM I containing 10% FCS and 0.5% chick embryo extract. The cells were then washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution and incubated for 2 days in growth medium, followed by 1, 2, or 3 days in differentiation medium. To analyze the effects of growth factors and RA the cells were incubated for 2 days in differentiation medium containing 10 ng/ml bFGF, 2.5 ng/ml TGF-β, or the indicated concentrations of RA. All transfections were performed at least three times with at least two plasmid DNA preparations. At various times the cells were harvested and assayed for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) and β-gal activities. CAT activity was measured as follows. Cell extracts were incubated for 14 h at 37 °C in a reaction mixture containing14C-labeled chloramphenicol (NEN Life Science Products) andn-butyryl-CoA (Promega). The reaction products were extracted with xylene, and the organic phase was counted in a scintillation counter. For the β-gal assay the cell extracts were incubated for 14 h at 37 °C with a buffer containing the substrate ONPG (Promega), and the absorbance was read at 420 nm with a spectrophotometer. For the construction of the syndecan-1 reporter (p-667CAT), the published mouse promoter sequence (14Hinkes M.T. Goldberger O.A. Neumann P.E. Kokenyesi R. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11440-11448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used to design oligonucleotides that were used to amplify by nested PCR a 667-bp upstream fragment that begins 50 bp downstream from the TATA box and contains potential transcription binding sites for SP1 (GC and GT boxes), MyoD (E-boxes) and NF-κB. The fragment was subcloned into the pCAT-basic vector (Promega). For the preparation of a reporter construct without E-boxes (p-244CAT) a 244-bp fragment was amplified by PCR with sense primer (CCT AGG AGG CGT AGA AGG) and antisense primer (CTG CGT TAG GCT CTG TCT CC) using p-667CAT plasmid as template. For construction of the p-myoCAT reporter plasmid, a fragment of 688 bp corresponding to a region of the myogenin promoter which contains the MEF1 and E-boxes sites (from +62 to −626 (37Edmondson D.G. Cheng T. Cserjesi P. Chakraborty T. Olson E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3665-3677Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar)) was amplified by nested PCR using a mouse BALB/c genomic library (ATCC) as template. The amplified fragment was ligated to the pCAT-basic vector as described above. All the pCAT vectors were sequenced using the Sequenase™ kit. A β-gal expression plasmid (RSV-βgal) was obtained from ATCC. This plasmid was co-transfected with the CAT constructs to monitor transfection efficiencies. To evaluate the expression of syndecan-1 in myoblasts, total RNA was isolated from C2C12 myoblasts and from 10T1/2 fibroblasts and NMuMG epithelial cells, two cell lines known to express syndecan-1. Fig. 1 A shows that C2C12 myoblasts express both the major 2.5-kilobase and minor 3.1-kilobase forms of syndecan-1 mRNA at levels comparable to the mouse epithelial cell line (29Saunders S. Jalkanen M. O'Farrel S. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1547-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Fig.1 B shows Western blot analyses of conditioned medium from myoblasts. The proteoglycans were eluted from a DEAE column at different NaCl concentrations (lane 2, 0.85 and lane 3, 1.0 m NaCl) and stained with affinity-purified anti-syndecan-1 antibodies (38Cizmeci-Smith G. Asundi V. Stahl R.C. Teichman L.J. Chernousov M. Cowan K. Carey D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15729-15736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The antibodies recognized a high molecular weight smear in the conditioned medium of myoblasts, which was eluted from the DEAE column at high salt concentration, consistent with staining of a proteoglycan. For comparison, lane 1shows an immunoblot of syndecan-1 present in conditioned medium of Schwann cells transfected with syndecan-1 cDNA (36Carey D. Stahl R.C. Cizmeci-Smith G. Asundi V.K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Together, these results indicate that myoblasts synthesize and release syndecan-1. To evaluate the expression of syndecan-1 during myoblast differentiation total RNA was isolated from myoblasts and from myoblasts induced to differentiate for 2 and 5 days and evaluated by Northern blot analysis. Fig.2 shows a significant decrease in the amount of syndecan-1 mRNA during differentiation, which was evident by day 2 of differentiation and essentially complete by day 5. Fig. 2 also shows the increase of mRNAs coding for creatine kinase and myogenin, skeletal muscle-specific markers that increase during differentiation. To evaluate further the expression of syndecan-1 during skeletal muscle differentiation cell cultures were stained with anti-syndecan-1 antibodies. Fig. 3 shows that myoblasts (panel A) express syndecan-1 that can be detected on the cell surface by immunofluorescent staining. Cells stained 2 days after initiation of differentiation (panel C) showed less immunoreactive syndecan-1. Essentially no staining was observed after 5 days of differentiation (myotubes) (panel E). Together, these results clearly demonstrate that the synthesis of syndecan-1 during differentiation of C2C12 skeletal muscle cells is significantly diminished. To characterize the mechanism underlying this down-regulation syndecan-1 transcriptional activity was measured in transient transfection experiments using a reporter vector consisting of 667 bp of the rat syndecan-1 promoter linked to a CAT reporter gene (p-667CAT). This promoter region contains a putative TATA box sequence and consensus binding sites for several transcriptions factors, including two E-boxes (414 and 289 bp upstream of TATA box). Fig.4 shows the CAT activity in myoblasts transiently transfected with p-667CAT and induced to differentiate. The transcriptional activity decreases significantly in differentiating cells so that by 3 days the activity is essentially abolished. Theinset in Fig. 4 shows transcriptional activity obtained with an expression construct that contains a myogenin promoter fused to a CAT reporter gene. As expected, and in contrast to syndecan-1 promoter activity, transcription driven by the myogenin promoter increases significantly after differentiation is triggered. These results demonstrate that the decrease in syndecan-1 expression which occurs during skeletal muscle differentiation results from a decreased rate of transcription. The syndecan-1 promoter contains several E-boxes, which are DNA binding sites for MyoD and related proteins, including myogenin. Upon induction of muscle differentiation these proteins bind to E-box regions and activate the transcription of skeletal muscle genes, such as creatine kinase (39Olson E.N. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1454-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). To evaluate the role of myogenin in the expression of syndecan-1, myoblasts were incubated for 2 days in differentiation medium with or without sodium butyrate (40Fiszman M.Y. Montorras D. Wright W. Gros F. Exp. Cell Res. 1980; 126: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), an agent known to block transcriptional activity of myogenin. The level of syndecan-1 mRNA was evaluated by Northern blot analyses. Fig. 5 A shows that the decrease in the syndecan-1 mRNA level was independent of the presence of butyrate. In contrast, the expression of creatine kinase was totally abolished by the treatment. These results suggest that myogenin expression is not involved in the decrease of syndecan-1 transcription observed during differentiation. To evaluate directly the role of myogenin and other MyoD proteins on the expression of syndecan-1, myoblasts were transiently transfected with a syndecan-1 promoter that contained the binding sequences for transcription factors SP1 (GC and GT boxes) and NF-κB, but lacked E-boxes (p-244CAT). The expression driven by this promoter was compared with the expression from the p-667CAT vector during differentiation. Fig. 5 B shows that the reporter expression obtained with both constructs was identical, and both were strongly inhibited during differentiation. Together these results suggest that the decrease in syndecan-1 expression observed during myogenesis is not related to the presence of E-boxes in the promoter region. In vitro induction of myoblast differentiation can be obtained by removal of growth factors from the medium. To evaluate the role of growth factors on the expression of syndecan-1, myoblasts were induced to differentiate in the presence and absence of defined growth factors (bFGF and TGF-β) and growth medium (10% FCS), and the expression of p-244CAT was evaluated in transient transfection experiments. Fig. 6shows that treatment of the cells for 2 days with bFGF (10 ng/ml) increased CAT activity slightly compared with differentiation medium (5% horse serum), whereas treatment with TGF-β (2.5 ng/ml) had no effect on syndecan-1 expression. Under these conditions a strong inhibitory effect of bFGF and TGF-β on myogenin expression was observed (data not shown) (18Brunetti A. Goldfine I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5960-5963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Brennan T.J. Edmondson D.G. Li L. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3822-3826Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, when bFGF and TGF-β were added together, activation of syndecan-1 promoter activity was obtained to values similar to those achieved when 10% FCS was used. These results suggest that growth factors like bFGF and TGF-β are necessary to maintain the expression of syndecan-1 and that the sequences contained in the proximal region of the promoter are sufficient to exert such regulation. RA, a vitamin A metabolite, plays a major role in skeletal muscle development (41Momoi T. Miyagawa-Tomita S. Kimura I. Momoi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and skeletal muscle differentiation (21Halevy O. Lerman O. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 154: 566-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.7 A, the presence of RA strongly inhibited the transcriptional activity of p-244CAT. Maximal inhibitory activity was observed at 10−6m RA. Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 7 B, the synergistic stimulatory effect observed for bFGF and TGF-β on syndecan-1 expression was totally abolished by RA. RA treatment also blocked the increase in syndecan-1 transcriptional activity caused by 10% FCS (Fig. 7 B). These results indicate that RA, an inducer of skeletal muscle differentiation, inhibits the expression of syndecan-1 and abolishes the stimulatory effect of bFGF and TGF-β or serum. The sequences responsible of this inhibitory effect are contained in the proximal region of the promoter gene contained in p-224CAT. The results presented in this paper demonstrate that the expression of syndecan-1, a transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan (1Bernfield M. Kokenyesi R. Kato M. Hinkes M.T. Spring J. Gallo R.L. Lose E.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 365-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar), decreases during differentiation of skeletal muscle cells. This conclusion is based on analysis of syndecan-1 mRNA levels, immunofluorescent staining of cells, and the activity of a reporter construct containing a portion of the rat syndecan-1 promoter. This phenomenon correlates well with the observation that in adult skeletal muscle tissue syndecan-1 is absent (29Saunders S. Jalkanen M. O'Farrel S. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1547-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) and with the loss of syndecan-1 in later stages of limb development (13Solursh M. Reiter R.S. Jensen K.L. Kato M. Bernfield M. Dev. Biol. 1990; 140: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The function of syndecan-1 in myoblasts and the consequences of syndecan-1 down-regulation during differentiation are not known. However, several roles for syndecan-1 and its down-regulation can be postulated. It is well known that proliferation of myoblasts is strongly stimulated by bFGF. At the same time this growth factor is a strong inhibitor of skeletal muscle differentiation (18Brunetti A. Goldfine I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5960-5963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Heparan sulfate proteoglycans act as co-receptors for bFGF (24Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar), allowing the binding of the growth factor to its signaling receptor on the plasma membrane and stimulating its biological effects. Therefore, the presence of syndecan-1 in the membrane might be critical for bFGF activity. Previously, we demonstrated that the expression of perlecan, a basal lamina-associated heparan sulfate proteoglycan, also decreases during differentiation (28Larraı́n, J., Alvarez, J., Hassell, J. R., and Brandan, E. (1997) Exp. Cell Res., in press.Google Scholar) and that the synthesis of glypican (26Campos A. Nuñez R. Koenig C.S. Carey D.J. Brandan E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), a lipid-anchored membrane-associated heparan sulfate proteoglycan, increases during differentiation (27Brandan E. Carey D.J. Larraı́n J. Melo F. Campos A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 71: 170-176PubMed Google Scholar). These observations are potentially important in the context of the specificity of action of different heparan sulfate proteoglycans. It has been shown that addition of perlecan but not soluble syndecans or glypican restores bFGF signaling and biological activity to heparan sulfate-deficient fibroblasts (25Aviezer D. Hecht D. Safran M. Eisinger M. David G. Yayon A. Cell. 1994; 79: 1005-1013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). On the other hand, recombinant membrane-associated syndecans or glypican have been shown to promote bFGF signaling in a hematopoietic cell line that expresses low levels of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (42Steinfeld R. Van Den Berghe H. David G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). It can be speculated that down-regulation of syndecan-1 expression, together with the bFGF receptor down-regulation (43Moore J.W. Dionne C. Jaye M. Swain J.L. Development. 1991; 111: 741-748PubMed Google Scholar), makes the cells refractory to the presence of bFGF and therefore allows differentiation of skeletal muscle (44Olwin B.B. Hauschka S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 503-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Experiments to test the effects of constitutive syndecan-1 expression and inhibition of endogenous syndecan-1 expression in myoblasts are in progress. Another potential role for syndecan-1 on the surface of myoblasts is the binding of extracellular matrix adhesive proteins. Syndecan-1 has been shown to bind several extracellular matrix adhesive molecules, including fibronectin (4Saunders S. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar); thrombospondin (5Sun X. Mosher D.F. Rapraeger A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2885-2889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); tenascin (6Salmivirta M. Elenius K. Vainio S. Hofer U. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Thesleff I. Jalkanen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7733-7739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and collagen types I, III and V (7Koda J.E. Rapraeger A. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8157-8162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell adhesion to these matrix proteins might not be required after differentiation when individual muscle fibers are in direct contact with basement membrane extracellular matrix. Furthermore, it has been shown that syndecan-1 can influence cell invasion (45Liebersbach B.F. Sanderson R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20013-20019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Myoblasts are able to migrate through basal lamina during early stages of differentiation (46Hughes S.M. Blau H.M. Nature. 1990; 345: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that the presence of syndecan-1 on the surface of myoblasts may influence their migratory pathway to give rise to slow or fast primary myotubes (47Van Swearingen J. Lance-Jones C. Dev. Biol. 1995; 170: 321-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Syndecan-1 expression in myoblasts appears to be regulated at the level of transcription. It has been suggested that down-regulation of syndecan-1 expression during muscle differentiation could result from the presence of E-boxes, target sites for the action of myogenic regulators such MyoD and myogenin (39Olson E.N. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1454-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar), in the syndecan-1 promoter (30Bernfield, M., Hinkes, M. T., and Gallo, R. L. (1993)Development (suppl.) 205–212.Google Scholar). We tested this by transiently transfecting myoblasts with CAT reporter vectors containing the rat syndecan-1 promoter that contained or lacked E-boxes. Our results clearly demonstrate that the presence of the E-boxes is not required for the decrease in expression of syndecan-1 which is observed after differentiation is triggered. These results are supported by the finding that treatment of differentiating myoblasts with sodium butyrate, an agent known to inhibit myogenin expression (40Fiszman M.Y. Montorras D. Wright W. Gros F. Exp. Cell Res. 1980; 126: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 48Johnston L.A. Tapscott S.J. Eisen H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5123-5130Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), had no effect on the pattern of syndecan-1 expression. Furthermore, treatment of the myoblasts with bFGF or TGF-β strongly inhibited myogenin expression (18, 19, and data not shown), without affecting syndecan-1 expression. Together, these results suggest that syndecan-1 expression in myoblasts is not directly regulated by myogenin. In this study we also found that promoter activity was not significantly affected by bFGF or TGF-β. However, exposure to both growth factors resulted in a significant increase in syndecan-1 gene activity. These results are similar to the finding of Elenius et al. (33Elenius K. Määttä A. Salmivirta M. Jalkanen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6435-6441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) on syndecan-1 expression in fibroblasts. On the other hand, treatment of the cells with RA, an inducer of skeletal muscle differentiation (21Halevy O. Lerman O. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 154: 566-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), inhibited the activity of the syndecan-1 reporter. Furthermore, RA was able to abolish the stimulatory effect of bFGF and TGF-β as well as FCS. This is particularly interesting because both growth factors and RA are known to be expressed in the vicinity of condensing mesenchymal cells (49Wilkinson D.G. Bhatt S. McMahon A.P. Development. 1989; 105: 131-136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 50Vaahtokari A. Vainio S. Thesleff I. Development. 1991; 113: 985-994Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and limb buds during early developmental stages (41Momoi T. Miyagawa-Tomita S. Kimura I. Momoi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the main regulatory elements responsible for the transcriptional regulation of syndecan-1 expression during myoblasts differentiation are contained in the proximal 277-bp segment of the syndecan-1 promoter. This region contains a putative TATA box sequence and consensus binding sites for several transcription factors such as SP1 and NF-κB. Vihinen et al. (51Vihinen T. Maatta A. Jaakkola P. Auvinen P. Jalkanen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12532-12541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that SP1-like transcription factors have an essential role in the regulation of the transcriptional activity of the syndecan-1 gene. This suggests that the down-regulation of syndecan-1 expression during myoblast terminal differentiation could be explained by variations in SP1 activity. There are several possible explanations for a decrease in SP1 activity. Changes in the level of expression of Sp1 during differentiation could occur, as was shown previously for different cells and tissues (52Saffer J.D. Jackson S.P. Annarella M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). An increase of SP1 phosphorylation which decreases its DNA binding activity, as demonstrated in terminal differentiation of liver (53Legget R.W. Armstrong S.A. Barry D. Mueller C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25879-25884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), is also possible. Alterations of co-activators that are required by SP1 to modify gene expression have also been described (54Pugh B.F. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 61: 1187-1197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Finally, recent data demonstrated that SP1 and E2F, a cell cycle-regulated transcription factor, act synergistically to activate dihydrofolate reductase gene transcription in the absence of E2F DNA binding sites (55Lin Y.L. Black A.R. Kostic D. Pajovic S. Hoover C.N. Azizkhan J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1668-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). E2F is sequestered by the retinoblastoma protein during differentiation (56Molkentin J.D. Olson E.N. Curr. Opin. Gen. Dev. 1996; 6: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), making SP1 possible less active and likely explaining the observed decrease in syndecan-1 expression during myoblast terminal differentiation. The inhibitory effect of RA is interesting not only as an explanation for the decrease of syndecan-1 expression during myoblasts differentiation, but also because suppression of syndecan-1 expression has been shown to be associated with malignant conversion (57Kato M. Saunders S. Nguyen H. Bernfield M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 559-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Tumor necrosis factor-α is the only other factor described which restricts the expression of syndecan-1 (58Kainulainen V. Nelimarkka L. Jarvelainen H. Laato M. Jalkanen M. Elenius K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18759-18766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effect of RA on syndecan-1 expression could be explained by the presence of putative RA response elements in the promoter region. This sequence is sufficient to cause the inhibitory effect of RA on the murine Oct4 promoter (59Schoorlemmer J. van Puijenbroek A. van Den Eijden M. Jonk L. Pals C. Kruijer K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1122-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The syndecan-1 promoter region contains sequences that are similar, but not identical to RA response elements. These are located 55, 80, and 100 bp upstream of the TATA box and are included in the p-244CAT reporter. The expression of perlecan during myogenesis is also down-regulated (28Larraı́n, J., Alvarez, J., Hassell, J. R., and Brandan, E. (1997) Exp. Cell Res., in press.Google Scholar). As indicated by Vihinen et al. (51Vihinen T. Maatta A. Jaakkola P. Auvinen P. Jalkanen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12532-12541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), the promoter region of perlecan (60Cohen I.R. Grassel S. Murdoch A.D. Iozzo R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10404-10408Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) resembles that of mouse syndecan-1. The upstream regions of these genes lack canonical TATA and CAAT boxes, but several SP1 transcription factor binding sites are present within the first 200 bp of the promoter. These observations suggest that similar regulatory mechanisms are involved in the regulation of expression of these cell surface macromolecules. In summary, we have found that the expression of syndecan-1 is down-regulated during skeletal muscle differentiation. This phenomenon is modulated by growth factors and RA but is E-box- and myogenin-independent. The regulatory sequences responsible for this modulation are contained within a 277-bp segment of the gene which contains consensus binding sites for several transcriptions factor such as SP1, NF-κB, and RA-binding proteins. These results will help toward understanding the complex regulation during development and differentiation of this key integral membrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan."
https://openalex.org/W2040926317,"Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) is a key factor in bone remodeling. In osteoblasts, IGF-I synthesis is enhanced by parathyroid hormone and prostaglandin E2(PGE2) through cAMP-activated protein kinase. In rats, estrogen loss after ovariectomy leads to a rise in serum IGF-I and an increase in bone remodeling, both of which are reversed by estrogen treatment. To examine estrogen-dependent regulation of IGF-I expression at the molecular level, primary fetal rat osteoblasts were co-transfected with the estrogen receptor (hER, to ensure active ER expression), and luciferase reporter plasmids controlled by promoter 1 of the rat IGF-I gene (IGF-I P1), used exclusively in these cells. As reported, 1 μm PGE2 increased IGF-I P1 activity by 5-fold. 17β-Estradiol alone had no effect, but dose-dependently suppressed the stimulatory effect of PGE2 by up to 90% (ED50 ∼0.1 nm). This occurred within 3 h, persisted for at least 16 h, required ER, and appeared specific, since 17α-estradiol was 100–300-fold less effective. By contrast, 17β-estradiol stimulated estrogen response element (ERE)-dependent reporter expression by up to 10-fold. 17β-Estradiol also suppressed an IGF-I P1 construct retaining only minimal promoter sequence required for cAMP-dependent gene activation, but did not affect the 60-fold increase in cAMP induced by PGE2. There is no consensus ERE in rat IGF-I P1, suggesting novel downstream interactions in the cAMP pathway that normally enhances IGF-I expression in skeletal cells. To explore this, nuclear extract from osteoblasts expressing hER were examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay using the atypical cAMP response element in IGF-I P1. Estrogen alone did not cause DNA-protein binding, while PGE2 induced a characteristic gel shift complex. Co-treatment with both hormones caused a gel shift greatly diminished in intensity, consistent with their combined effects on IGF-I promoter activity. Nonetheless, hER did not bind IGF-I cAMP response element or any adjacent sequences. These results provide new molecular evidence that estrogen may temper the biological effects of hormones acting through cAMP to regulate skeletal IGF-I expression and activity. Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) is a key factor in bone remodeling. In osteoblasts, IGF-I synthesis is enhanced by parathyroid hormone and prostaglandin E2(PGE2) through cAMP-activated protein kinase. In rats, estrogen loss after ovariectomy leads to a rise in serum IGF-I and an increase in bone remodeling, both of which are reversed by estrogen treatment. To examine estrogen-dependent regulation of IGF-I expression at the molecular level, primary fetal rat osteoblasts were co-transfected with the estrogen receptor (hER, to ensure active ER expression), and luciferase reporter plasmids controlled by promoter 1 of the rat IGF-I gene (IGF-I P1), used exclusively in these cells. As reported, 1 μm PGE2 increased IGF-I P1 activity by 5-fold. 17β-Estradiol alone had no effect, but dose-dependently suppressed the stimulatory effect of PGE2 by up to 90% (ED50 ∼0.1 nm). This occurred within 3 h, persisted for at least 16 h, required ER, and appeared specific, since 17α-estradiol was 100–300-fold less effective. By contrast, 17β-estradiol stimulated estrogen response element (ERE)-dependent reporter expression by up to 10-fold. 17β-Estradiol also suppressed an IGF-I P1 construct retaining only minimal promoter sequence required for cAMP-dependent gene activation, but did not affect the 60-fold increase in cAMP induced by PGE2. There is no consensus ERE in rat IGF-I P1, suggesting novel downstream interactions in the cAMP pathway that normally enhances IGF-I expression in skeletal cells. To explore this, nuclear extract from osteoblasts expressing hER were examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay using the atypical cAMP response element in IGF-I P1. Estrogen alone did not cause DNA-protein binding, while PGE2 induced a characteristic gel shift complex. Co-treatment with both hormones caused a gel shift greatly diminished in intensity, consistent with their combined effects on IGF-I promoter activity. Nonetheless, hER did not bind IGF-I cAMP response element or any adjacent sequences. These results provide new molecular evidence that estrogen may temper the biological effects of hormones acting through cAMP to regulate skeletal IGF-I expression and activity. Although postmenopausal osteoporosis is one of the most prevalent age-related skeletal disorders, our understanding of the role of estrogen, which has a critical role in maintaining bone mass, remains incomplete. The principal laboratory animal model of postmenopausal osteoporosis is the ovariectomized (OVX) 1The abbreviations used are: OVX, ovariectomized; IL, interleukin; IGF-I, insulin-like growth factor-I; IGF-I P1, promoter 1 of the rat IGF-I gene; PTH, parathyroid hormone; PKA, cAMP-activated protein kinase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; ER, estrogen receptor; ERE, estrogen response element; DTT, dithiothreitol; bp, base pair(s); CRE, cAMP response element. rat. One consistent observation with this model is an increase in the rate of bone remodeling after OVX-induced estrogen depletion (1Kalu D.N.

Furthermore, consistent with a cause and effect relationship, estrogen administration re-establishes a reduced rate of bone remodeling in the OVX rat. Bone remodeling consists of two opposing events, i.e. bone resorption and formation (6Baron R. Favus M.J. Primer on the Metabolic Bone Diseases and Disorders of Mineral Metabolism. 3rd Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, New York1996: 3-10Google Scholar). Skeletal integrity in adults relies on closely coupled remodeling where there is a balance between these catabolic and anabolic processes. Net bone loss in postmenopausal osteoporosis is thought to result from bone resorption that exceeds formation, even though both processes are accelerated in this condition (7Kalu D.N. Liu C.C. Salerno E. Hollis B. Echon R. Ray M. Bone Miner. 1991; 14: 175-187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 8Turner R.T. Evans G.L. Wakley G.K. J. Bone Miner.

Recent data indicate the involvement of several interleukins (IL-1β and IL-6) in estrogen deficiency-induced bone resorption (10Gowen M. Wood D.D. Ihrie E.J. McGuire M.K.B. Russell G.G. Nature. 1983; 306: 378-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 11Girasole G. Jilka R.L. Passeri G. Boswell S. Boder G. Williams D.C. Manolagas S.C. J. Clin.

Yang M.X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4971-4979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IL-6 has emerged as a pivotal factor in accelerated bone resorption in the estrogen-depeleted state, due in part to the apparent absence of bone loss in OVX mice carrying a knockout of the IL-6 gene (14Poli V. Balena R. Fattori E. Markatos A. Yamamoto M. Tanaka H. Ciliberto G. Rodan G.A. Costantini F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1189-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). While progress has been made in understanding the interactions of estrogen and interleukins in regulating bone resorption, relatively little is known about factors involved in bone formation in the estrogen-depleted state. Recently, several groups reported elevated serum IGF-I levels that returned to normal following estrogen supplementation in OVX rats (15Sato F. Ouchi Y. Masuyama A. Nakamura T. Hosoi T. Okamoto Y.

Bone Miner. 1994; 25: 135-148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Similarly, postmenopausal women given estrogen experience a drop in serum IGF-I levels (17Shewmon D.A. Stock J.L. Rosen C.J. Heiniluoma K.M. Hogue M.M. Morrison A. Doyle E.M. Ukena T. Weale V. Baker S. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1586-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The endocrine influence of elevated levels of circulating IGF-I is likely to include a positive effect on bone formation (18Russell S.M. Spencer E.M.

Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The osteotropic hormone, parathyroid hormone (PTH), while stimulating resorption, also stimulates IGF-I synthesis by osteoblasts through a mechanism involving cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (22McCarthy T.L. Centrella M. Canalis E. Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 1247-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 23Canalis E. Centrella M. McCarthy T.L. J. Clin.

PTH administered intermittently in vivo orin vitro increases osteoblast replication and matrix collagen synthesis (23Canalis E. Centrella M. McCarthy T.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 60-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 28Howard G.A. Bottemiller B.L. Turner R.T. Rader J.I. Baylink D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

An increase in IGF-I expression is in part responsible for the anabolic effect of PTH. In fetal rat calvarial bone explants, a brief exposure to PTH increases the rate of collagen synthesis, and neutralizing antibodies to IGF-I dramatically reduce this effect (23Canalis E. Centrella M. McCarthy T.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 60-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Therefore, IGF-I appears to couple this aspect of bone remodeling. Earlier studies examining the influence of estrogen on IGF-I expression by primary cultures of neonatal rat calvarial osteoblasts indicated a small stimulatory effect (∼2-fold), thought to result from changes in the rate of gene transcription (33Ernst M. Heath J.K. Rodan G.A. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 825-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 34Ernst M. Rodan G.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1081-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, OVX increases IGF-I mRNA expression in the calvariae of growing rats, and this effect can be reversed by the estrogen agonist diethylstilbesterol (35Turner R.T. Backup P. Kline B.C. Colvard D.S. Spelsberg T.C. Spencer E.M. Molecular Concepts of Insulin-like Growth Factors. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1991: 143-153Google Scholar, 36Turner R.T. Bachup P. Shermanm P.J. Hill E. Evans G.L. Spelsberg T.C. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 883-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These latter observations agree with the elevated serum IGF-I levels seen in OVX rats, indicated earlier (15Sato F. Ouchi Y. Masuyama A. Nakamura T. Hosoi T. Okamoto Y. Sasaki N. Shiraki M. Orimo H. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1993; 53: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 16Kalu D.N. Arjmandi B.H. Liu C.-C. Salih M.A. Birnbaum R.S. Bone Miner. 1994; 25: 135-148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Therefore, in vivo and in vitro findings together predict that estrogen may suppress IGF-I expression in skeletal tissue and that this may be focused on the stimulatory effect of agents that induce cAMP. This interpretation is consistent with the lower rate of bone remodeling seen in the estrogen replete versusestrogen-depleted animals. In this study we wished to evaluate the effect of 17β-estradiol on IGF-I promoter activity. Because we previously demonstrated a PKA-dependent increase in IGF-I transcription after exposure to PGE2 in fetal rat osteoblasts (37McCarthy T.L. Centrella M. Raisz L.G. Canalis E. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 2895-2900Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 38Bichell D.P. Rotwein P. McCarthy T.L.

Chem. 1996; 271: 21835-21841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we used this model to examine the influence of 17β-estradiol alone and in combination with PGE2 on IGF-I promoter function. Furthermore, because other studies suggested that estrogen can suppress an increase in cAMP in response to PTH (33Ernst M. Heath J.K. Rodan G.A. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 825-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), we also examined the effect of 17β-estradiol on PGE2-stimulated cAMP in these cultures. Although we find a potent regulatory effect of 17β-estradiol on cAMP-dependent IGF-I expression, it occurs downstream of cAMP accumulation. Primary osteoblast-enriched cell cultures were prepared from the parietal bones of 22-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat fetuses (Charles River Laboratories, Raleigh, NC). Animals were housed and euthanized by methods approved by the Yale University Animal Care and Use Committee. Cranial sutures were eliminated during dissection, and the bones were digested with collagenase for five sequential 20-min intervals. The cell population released during the last three digestions exhibits biochemical characteristics associated with differentiated osteoblasts, including PTH receptors, type I collagen synthesis, and a rise in osteocalcin expression in response to dihydroxyvitamin D3 (41McCarthy T.L. Centrella M. Canalis E. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1988; 3: 401-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 42Centrella M. Canalis E. McCarthy T.L. Orloff J.J. Stewart A.F. Insogna K.L. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Histochemical staining demonstrates that approximately 80% of the cells express alkaline phosphatase, 2T. L. McCarthy and M. Centrella, unpublished data. although this itself is not entirely specific for osteoblasts. However, using these criteria, as well as differential sensitivity to transforming growth factor-β, bone morphogenetic protein-2, various prostaglandins, and the ability to form mineralized nodules in vitro (43Centrella M. Kim J. Pham T. Casinghino S. Rosen V. Wozney J. McCarthy T.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3273-3281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Centrella M. Casinghino S. Gundberg C. McCarthy T.L. Wozney J. Rosen V. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 785: 224-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), these cells are well distinguished from the less differentiated cells released during earlier collagenase digestions. Cells from the last three digestions were pooled and then plated at 4,800 per cm2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 0.1 mg/ml ascorbic acid, penicillin and streptomycin (all from Life Technologies Inc.) and 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma). At the time of transfection, cultures were rinsed twice with phenol red-free, serum-free DMEM. All subsequent culturing was in phenol red-free DMEM, with (growth medium) or without (treatment medium) charcoal-stripped serum, prepared as described by Ernst and Rodan (34Ernst M. Rodan G.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1081-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Rat IGF-I promoter 1 constructs have been described previously (45Hall L.J. Kajimoto Y. Bichell D. Kim S.-W. James P.L. Counts D. Nixon L.J. Tobin G. Rotwein P. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 301-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). A Rous sarcoma virus promoter-driven expression vector for both the human estrogen receptor (pRSV-hER; containing a glycine to valine substitution at position 400), and a recombinant luciferase reporter construct containing two tandem estrogen response elements (ERE from the vitellogenin gene) along with the minimal prolactin promoter ((ERE)2PRL36-Luc), were kindly provided by Dr. Stuart Adler (Washington University School of Medicine). All plasmids were propagated in Escherichia colistrain DH5α with ampicillin selection and were prepared with a Wizard Plus Maxiprep DNA purification kit (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) and the manufacturer's recommended protocol. IGF-I promoter 1-luciferase reporter plasmids (1.25 μg/9.6-cm2 culture well) were co-transfected with pRSV-hER (1.25 μg/culture well). Cultures at 40% confluence were rinsed in serum-free medium and exposed to plasmids in the presence of 0.5% Lipofectin™ (Life Technologies Inc.) for 3 h. The solution was then replaced with growth medium containing 5% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum, and cultures were re-incubated for 48 h. Subconfluent cultures were rinsed with serum-free medium and treated for the indicated times with vehicle (ethanol-diluted 1/1,000 or greater), PGE2, 17β-estradiol, or 17α-estradiol (all from Sigma; each was dissolved in 95% ethanol), either individually or in combination. After treatment, medium was aspirated, and cultures were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in 100 μl of 25 mm Tris phosphate (pH 7.8), 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 2 mm1,2-diaminocyclohexane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100 (cell lysis buffer, Promega Corp.). Nuclei were pelleted at 12,000 × g for 5 min, and supernatants were stored at −75 °C until assay. A commercial kit (Promega Corp.) was used to measure luciferase by single channel photon counting, and enzyme activity was corrected for protein content as determined by the Bradford assay (46Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (218585) Google Scholar). Cultures were transiently transfected with pRSV-hER. After 48 h, cultures were rinsed twice with serum-free phenol red-free DMEM and exposed to control medium or 10 nm 17β-estradiol for 30 min. Cultures were then treated for 5 min with 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, to inhibit endogenous phosphodiesterase activity, prior to a 10-min treatment (at room temperature) with control (ethanol vehicle), PGE2 (1 μm), 17β-estradiol (0.1–10 nm), alone or in combination. Treatments were terminated by aspirating the medium, and the plates were immediately frozen at −75 °C. Cultures were extracted with n-propyl alcohol, and the samples were air-dried and then dissolved in 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 6.2). An aliquot was used to measure cAMP content using a highly specific commercial radioimmunoassay kit (Biomedical Technologies, Inc.). The amount of cAMP in each extract was determined from the linear portion of a standard curve and is expressed as picomoles of cAMP/2-cm2 culture, as reported previously (27McCarthy T.L. Centrella M. Canalis E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15353-15356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Control or pRSV-hER-transfected cultures were rinsed with serum-free medium and exposed to treatment solution for 4 h. Medium was aspirated, and cultures were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C. All subsequent steps were performed on ice or at 4 °C. Cells were harvested with a cell scraper and gently pelleted, and the pellets were washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Nuclear extracts were prepared by the method of Lee et al. with minor modifications (39McCarthy T.L. Thomas M.J. Centrella M. Rotwein P. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3901-3908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Lee K.A. Bindereif A. Green M.R. Gene. Anal. Tech. 1988; 5: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT) with phosphatase inhibitors (1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride), protease inhibitors (0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin; Sigma), and 1% Triton X-100. Nuclei were gently pelleted. Nuclei were resuspended in hypertonic buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.42m NaCl, 0.2 mm Na2EDTA, 25% glycerol, and the phosphatase and protease inhibitors indicated above. Soluble proteins released by a 30-min incubation at 4 °C were collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was collected and aliquoted for storage at −75 °C. Using previously published methods (40Thomas M.J. Umayahara Y. Shu H. Centrella M. Rotwein P. McCarthy T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21835-21841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 48Revzin A. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 346-355PubMed Google Scholar, 49Carey J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), radiolabeled double-stranded probe (Universal DNA, Inc., Tigard, OR) was prepared by annealing complementary oligonucleotides, followed by fill-in of single-stranded overhangs with dCTP, dGTP, dTTP, and [α-32P]dATP, using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. Five to ten μg of nuclear extract protein was preincubated for 20 min on ice with 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) with or without unlabeled specific or nonspecific competitor DNAs in 60 mm KCl, 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 7.5% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, and 0.025% bovine serum albumin. After the addition of 5 × 104 cpm of DNA probe (0.1–0.2 ng) for 30 min on ice, samples were applied to a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel that was pre-electrophoresed for 30 min at 12.5 V/cm at 25 °C in 45 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, 1 mmEDTA. Electrophoresis proceeded for 2.5 h under identical conditions. Dried gels were exposed to x-ray film at −75 °C with intensifying screens. Electrophoretic mobility supershift analysis was performed in select experiments using normal rabbit serum as a negative control and monoclonal anti-rhER antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) for its ability to produce a supershift of hER-bound probe. Sequences of sense strands of oligonucleotides used in the electrophoretic mobility shift assays are as follows: HS3D, 5′-GAGCAGATAGAGCCTGCGCAATCGAAATA-3′ (the minimal binding sequence of the atypical cyclic response element within the HS3D footprint site of the rat IGF-I promoter 1 is underlined (40Thomas M.J. Umayahara Y. Shu H. Centrella M. Rotwein P. McCarthy T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21835-21841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar)) and ERE, 5′-GATCCAAAGTCAGGTCACAGTGACCTGATCAAAGA-3′ (the estrogen response element is underlined in this sequence). 17β-Estradiol, 17α-estradiol, and PGE2 were obtained from Sigma and were 99% pure as determined by TLC. Data were assessed by one way analysis of variance with SigmaStat® software, with the Student-Newan-Keuls method for post hoc comparison. The IGF-I gene has two promoters, and promoter 1 (P1) is used exclusively in cultures of fetal rat osteoblasts (38Bichell D.P. Rotwein P. McCarthy T.L. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 1020-1028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Initial studies were conducted with osteoblast cultures transiently transfected with the longest IGF-I P1-luciferase reporter construct, IGF1711b/Luc (containing 1711 bp of upstream sequence, and the initial 328 bp of transcribed but untranslated exon 1), which we previously found to be most responsive to treatment with the cAMP-inducing agent PGE2 (39McCarthy T.L. Thomas M.J. Centrella M. Rotwein P. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3901-3908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To ensure expression of active estrogen receptors, cultures were co-transfected with the hER expression vector pRSV-hER. Incubation with 17β-estradiol at 0.01–10 nmfor 16 h did not alter basal IGF-I P1 activity (Fig.1, left panel). As a positive control, parallel cultures were co-transfected with pRSV-hER and a recombinant reporter plasmid containing tandem copies of the consensus estrogen response element (ERE) from the vitellogenin gene, and a short segment of the prolactin promoter (plasmid (ERE)2PRL-Luc). Unlike the IGF-I P1 recombinant plasmid, treatment with 17β-estradiol enhanced expression of this ERE-containing reporter gene up to 10-fold (Fig. 1, center panel). Co-transfection with pRSV-hER was required for all 17β-estradiol-dependent responses, including activation of the (ERE)2PRL-Luc construct (data not shown). Fetal rat osteoblasts respond to PGE2 with a rapid increase in IGF-I expression, mediated by PKA-dependent activation of IGF-I P1 (39McCarthy T.L. Thomas M.J. Centrella M. Rotwein P. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3901-3908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This occurs through an atypical CRE located at bp +202 to +209 of exon 1 (40Thomas M.J. Umayahara Y. Shu H. Centrella M. Rotwein P. McCarthy T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21835-21841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and PTH similarly requires this element to enhance IGF-I promoter function (data not shown). As we reported previously, PGE2 (1 μm, 16 h) increased IGF-I P1 activity 5-fold (39McCarthy T.L. Thomas M.J. Centrella M. Rotwein P. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3901-3908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While 17β-estradiol alone was ineffective, co-treatment with PGE2 led to a dose-dependent suppression of IGF-I promoter activation over a concentration range of 0.1–10 nm (ED50∼0.1 nm) (Fig. 1, left panel). This response required expression of hER (Fig. 1, right panel), and an active form of estradiol, since 17α-estradiol was 100–300-fold less potent than 17β-estradiol at blocking PGE2-mediated IGF-I P1 activity (Fig. 1, left panel). By contrast, expression of the ERE-driven reporter gene was not inhibited by co-treatment with 17β-estradiol and PGE2 (see Fig. 3). Time course experiments next were performed to examine the kinetics of inhibition of IGF-I P1 activity by 17β-estradiol. Cells were treated with PGE2 (1 μm) or 17β-estradiol (10 nm), alone or in combination for 3, 6, or 16 h. PGE2-activated expression of the IGF-I P1 reporter gene was rapidly blunted by 17β-estradiol. Both the stimulatory effect of PGE2 on IGF-I promoter activity and the opposing, suppressive influence of 17β-estradiol were observed within 3 h of hormone treatment. Both responses were maintained throughout a 16 h incubation, while the ERE-containing plasmid ((ERE)2PRL-Luc) was activated progressively by 17β-estradiol (Fig. 2). IGF-I P1 lacks a consensus ERE, and yet 17β-estradiol suppressed cAMP-dependent promoter activation. Therefore, an effort was made to localize the region(s) of the promoter responsible for the opposing effect of estrogen on cAMP-mediated gene activation. Deletion of 5′ flanking DNA from nucleotides −1711 to −123 (with respect to the most 5′ transcription start site of rat IGF-I exon 1 (45Hall L.J. Kajimoto Y. Bichell D. Kim S.-W. James P.L. Counts D.

Centrella M. Rotwein P. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3901-3908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or the opposing inhibitory effect of 17β-estradiol (Fig.3). All three of the plasmids tested retained the same 328 bp of exon 1, which preserves the unconventional CRE (located at bp +202 to +209) required for the stimulatory effect of PGE2(40Thomas M.J.

https://openalex.org/W2128539416,"Two distinct, TATA box-containing promoters regulate the transcriptional activity of the Xenopusvitellogenin A1 gene. These two promoters are of different strength and are separated by 1.8 kilobase pairs of untranslated sequence. Estrogen receptor (ER) and its ligand, 17β-estradiol, induce the activity of both promoters. The estrogen response elements (EREs) are located proximal to the downstream i promoter while no ERE-like sequences have been identified in the vicinity of the upstreamio promoter. We show here, that transcriptional activity of the upstream io promoter is Sp1-dependent. Moreover, we demonstrate that estrogen inducibility of theio promoter results from functional interactions between the io bound Sp1 and the ER bound at the proximity ofi. Functional interactions between Sp1 and ER do not require the presence of a TATA box for transcriptional activation, as is demonstrated using the acyl-CoA oxidase promoter. The relative positions that ER and Sp1 occupy with respect to the initiation site determines whether these two transcription activators can synergize for transcription initiation.

The relative positions that ER and Sp1 occupy with respect to the initiation site determines whether these two transcription activators can synergize for transcription initiation. Transcription is one of the levels at which eukaryotic gene expression is controlled. Regulation at this level is achieved through the coordinate and cooperative action of regulatory proteins collectively known as transcription factors. Proteins that regulate RNA polymerase II-dependent gene expression include the factors that associate with RNA polymerase II and form the transcription initiation complex as well as activators that are not directly involved with the recruitment of polymerase II to the promoter (reviewed in Refs. 1Tjian R. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 77: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar and 2Zawel L. Reinberg D. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 67-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). These latter proteins bind specific DNA elements located either upstream or downstream of the core promoter and modulate basal and signal-dependent transcription in a ubiquitous or specific manner. Nuclear hormone receptors (NHR) 1The abbreviations used are: NHR(s), nuclear hormone receptor(s); vtg, vitellogenin; ER, estrogen receptor; ERE, estrogen response element; ERU, estrogen response unit; bp, base pair(s); kbp, kilobase pair(s); nt, nucleotide; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift analysis; ACO, acyl-CoA oxidase; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor; RXR, retinoic X receptor; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; E2, 17β-estradiol. form the best characterized class of transcription factors that are activated by extracellular signals (reviewed in Refs. 3Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schütz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M.

FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2243-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Ligand binding to NHR is correlated with the transcriptional activation or inhibition of target genes. In some instances it is a prerequisite for the entry of the receptor into the nucleus or for DNA binding (reviewed in Ref. 6Beato M. Herrlich P. Schütz G. Cell. 1995; 83: 851-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). Binding of NHR to target promoters requires the presence of a hormone response element. These elements, for the most part, consist of two copies of a hexanucleotide core sequence, which can have direct repeat, palindromic, or inverted palindrome configurations (reviewed in Ref.7Glass C.K. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 391-407PubMed Google Scholar). Contrary to the NHRs that control gene expression in developmental stage-, tissue-, sex specific- and ligand-dependent manner, ubiquitous transcription activators are responsible for the basal expression level of a large number of genes. One such prototypic transcription factor is Sp1, a ubiquitous higher eukaryote protein that activates transcription through its glutamine-rich transactivation domain (8Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). As is the case for the nuclear receptors, Sp1 binding to DNA and subsequent activation of target genes requires the presence of specific regulatory sequences on the promoters of these genes, known as GC boxes with the consensus sequence 5′-GGCGGG-3′ (9Dynan W.S. Tjian R. Nature. 1985; 316: 774-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). The action of transcription activators is thought to be mediated through direct interactions of the activation domain(s) of these proteins with components of the basal transcription machinery (10Choy B. Green M.R. Nature. 1993; 366: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). For instance, Sp1 has been shown to interact with the TAFII110 component of the TFIID complex (11Hoey T. Weinzierl R.O.J. Gill G. Chen J.L. Dynlacht B.D. Tjian R. Cell. 1993; 72: 247-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), while members of the NHR superfamily, such as the estrogen receptor and COUP-TFI, have been reported to interact with TAFII30 and TFIIB, respectively (12Jacq X. Brou C. Lutz Y. Davidson I. Chambon P. Tora L. Cell. 1994; 79: 107-117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 13Ing N.H. Beekman J.M. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17617-17623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such interactions could be responsible for the recruitment of additional basal transcription complex factors, the stabilization of the transcription complex and possibly promoter chromatin rearrangements, which result in an increased transcriptional activity from the target promoter. Promoters of genes regulated by NHRs can contain, in addition to the hormone response element, binding sites for other transcriptional activators; an additional mechanism of transcriptional fine tuning is, thus, possible through functional interactions between distinct transcription factors. Indeed, we have shown previously that the estrogen receptor can transcriptionally synergize with the proline-rich transactivation domain of CTF/NF-I on synthetic promoters (14Martinez E. Dusserre Y. Wahli W. Mermod N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2937-2945Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and that the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)/retinoid X receptor (RXR) heterodimer synergizes with Sp1 for the activation of the rat acyl-CoA oxidase (ACO) promoter (15Krey G. Mahfoudi A. Wahli W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 219-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The genes coding for the egg yolk proteins vitellogenins (vtg) are among the few known targets of direct estrogen receptor action (16Wahli W. Dawid I.B. Ryffel G.U. Weber R. Science. 1981; 212: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). InXenopus laevis four genes, A1, A2, B1 and B2, have been identified that encode distinct but closely related vtgs. All four genes are expressed in developmental stage- (adult), tissue- (hepatocyte), sex- (female), and hormone (estrogen)-dependent manner (reviewed in Ref. 17Wahli W. Trends Genet. 1988; 4: 227-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The promoter of the B1 gene is the best characterized in terms of identification of transcription factor binding sites and nucleosome positioning (18Cardinaux J.-R. Chapel S. Wahli W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32947-32956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Schild C. Claret F.X. Wahli W. Wolffe A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 423-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to the TATA box and estrogen-responsive unit (ERU), there exist several CTF/NF-I, C/EBP, and HNF-3 binding sites. The vtg A1 gene promoter, which has not been studied extensively so far, has a unique feature that consists of the presence of a functional transcription initiation site, io, located 1.8 kbp upstream of the major transcription initiation site, i (20Tremea F. Batistuzzo de Medeiros S.R. ten Heggeler-Bordier B. Germond J.E. Seiler-Tuyns A. Wahli W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1596-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In this work, we have studied the mechanism of estrogen-dependent stimulation of the upstream io promoter. We demonstrate that transcriptional activity from io is mediated by Sp1, which by functional interactions with the estrogen receptor, bound proximal to the i transcriptional initiation site, confers estradiol inducibility to this promoter. The reporter plasmids pA1(−580/+6).CAT, pA1(−1995/+6).CAT, pio.CAT.ERE, and pio.CAT have been described previously (20Tremea F. Batistuzzo de Medeiros S.R. ten Heggeler-Bordier B. Germond J.E. Seiler-Tuyns A. Wahli W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1596-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The ERE.ACO.LUC plasmid contains a single copy of the vtg A2 ERE cloned upstream of position −208 of the rat acyl CoA-oxidase promoter (21Osumi T. Ishii N. Miyazama S. Hashimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8138-8143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was constructed by cloning the ERE.ACO(−208/+20) BglII-HindIII fragment in the corresponding sites of the pGL-2 basic vector (Promega). Vectors pio.TATA.i.CAT and pio.GC.i.CAT were constructed by cloning PCR amplified fragments containing sequences from −1976 to −1803 and from −1976 to −-1848, respectively, of the A1 promoter at position −580 (PstI site) of the pA1(−580/+6).CAT plasmid. TheXenopus estrogen receptor cloned in the expression plasmid pSG5 (pSG5.xER) has been described previously (22Claret F.-X. Chapel S. Garcés J. Tsai-Pflugfelder M. Bertholet C. Shapiro D.J. Wittek R. Wahli W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14047-14055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression vector for Sp1 (pPADH.Sp1) has also been described previously (8Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). The recombinant plasmid Sp1-24 contains the three GC boxes of the io promoter, included in the 63-bpHpaII-HhaI fragment spanning positions −1900 to −1837 of the vtg A1 promoter, in the SmaI site of the pGEM3 vector (Promega). The plasmid Sp1-CAT was constructed by cloning the 62-bp NcoI-FokI fragment, from positions 107 to 168 of the pSV2CAT plasmid (23Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar), which contains the five GC boxes of the SV40 early promoter, into the SmaI site of pGEM3. Plasmid ESV40 contains a 160-bp fragment, positions 180–340 of the SV40 enhancer derived from pSV2CAT, cloned into the SmaI site of pGEM3. TheDrosophila-derived SL-2 cell line was maintained and transfected as described previously (15Krey G. Mahfoudi A. Wahli W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 219-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For the transfection of a single 3-cm diameter plate, 1 μg of xER expression vector, 2 μg of Sp1 expression vector, and 3 μg of reporter plasmid were utilized. For normalization of the transfection efficiency, 0.5 μg of CMV-β-Gal (24MacGregor G.R. Caskey C.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) internal control plasmid were also included in each transfected plate (2.5 × 106 cells). Transfections in HeLa cells were performed as described previously (22Claret F.-X. Chapel S. Garcés J. Tsai-Pflugfelder M. Bertholet C. Shapiro D.J. Wittek R. Wahli W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14047-14055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); 0.5 μg of xER expression vector, 2 μg of reporter plasmid, and 0.5 μg of CMV-β-Gal plasmid were used for each 3-cm diameter plate (2.5 × 105 cells). Nuclear extracts from livers of femaleX. laevis were prepared as described previously (25Corthésy B. Hipskind R. Theulaz I. Wahli W. Science. 1988; 239: 1137-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts from the Xenopus kidney-derived B3.2 cell line (a kind gift of Dr. R. Weber, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland) and from HeLa cells were prepared as described in Ref.26Shapiro D.J. Sharp P.A. Wahli W. Keller M.J. DNA ( N. Y. ). 1988; 7: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar. For footprint experiments the probe used was the 226-bp SalI-PstI fragment derived from the plasmid pA1(−1995/+6).CAT (positions −1995 to −1769 of the vtg A1 promoter). This fragment was end-labeled at theSalI site with [α-32P]dATP and Klenow enzyme as described in ref. 27Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar. The binding reaction was performed on ice for 30 min in a buffer containing 41 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 0.16 mm EDTA, 0.16 mm EGTA, 1.6 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 16% glycerol, in a total volume of 20 μl. For each reaction 1.6 ng of labeled DNA fragment (15,000 cpm) and 1 footprinting unit of purified Sp1 (Promega) were used. DNase I digestion was performed for 3 min on ice with 50 ng of DNase I (Boehringer Mannheim), diluted in 10 mm Hepes, 25 mm CaCl2, pH 7.9. The digestion was stopped by the addition of 83 μl of stop buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 3 μg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA, and 10 μg of proteinase K (Boehringer Mannheim). The samples were incubated at 45 °C for 1 h after which they were extracted twice with phenol/chloroform and the DNA was precipitated by the addition of 3 volumes of ethanol. The samples were analyzed on a 8% sequencing gel along with the G and C + T chemical modification sequencing reactions of the corresponding DNA fragment. For mobility shift assays, Xenopus liver nuclear extracts (4 μg of total protein content) were incubated with 1 ng of labeled probe (Sp1-24) for 30 min on ice in a total volume of 20 μl of binding buffer containing 26 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 50 mmKCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μm ZnSO4, 20% glycerol, and 4 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). For binding competition experiments, the reactions were carried out as above with the exception that the nuclear extracts were incubated for 15 min with the competitor DNA before addition of the radiolabeled probe. For antibody-induced supershift, 3 μl of the human monoclonal anti-Sp1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biochemicals) were included in the reaction mixture. The reaction was incubated for 45 min at room temperature. Protein·DNA complexes were separated from the free probe on a 6% polyacrylamide, 0.5 × TBE (0.09 m Tris borate, 0.002 m EDTA) gel, and they were visualized by autoradiography. For EMSA using methylated probes, the reactions were carried out as above except that either Xenopus liver nuclear extracts or purified Sp1 (Promega) were incubated 10 min on ice before adding 1 ng of the corresponding labeled probe for 30 min on ice. To analyze the importance of cations for DNA binding of Sp1-like activities, Xenopusliver nuclear extracts or purified Sp1 were incubated with 50 mm EDTA for 60 min on ice. The mixtures were then dialyzed twice (1 h each) against 500 ml of the binding buffer used to study protein-DNA interactions (see above), but which was devoid of ZnSO4. The dialyzed mixtures were then brought to a concentration of 0.5 mm metal sulfate salts, CoSO4, ZnSO4, or NiSO4, and incubated during 45 min on ice. The mixtures were then tested in EMSA as described above. Probe Sp1-24 was end-labeled with [α-32P]dATP at the EcoRI site for the coding strand and at the BamHI site for the complementary strand. The labeled probes were partially methylated with dimethyl sulfate as described in Ref. 28Maxam A. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9014) Google Scholar. The chemically modified probes were used in EMSA in the conditions described above but scaled-up five times. Protein·DNA complexes as well as the free probe, electrophoretically separated and visualized by autoradiography, were excised from the gel by electroelution for 2 h at 4 °C in TAE buffer (0.08 m Tris acetate, 0.002 m EDTA). Following electroelution, an equal volume of a solution containing 50 μg of proteinase K, 20 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS was added to the samples, which were then incubated for 30 min at 45 °C. The proteinase K digestion was followed by several phenol/chloroform extractions before the DNA was precipitated and cleaved with 1m piperidine for 30 min at 95 °C. The cleaved fragments were washed several times with 50% methanol before electrophoresis on a 12% polyacrylamide, 7.5 m urea gel. Transcription reactions were performed in a buffer containing 2.6 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm ZnSO4, 0.13 mm ZnCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.015 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 4 mm spermidine, 5 mm creatine phosphate, 0.6 mm of each ATP, CTP, GTP, and UTP, 40 unites of rRNasin (Promega), 1 μg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA, 250 ng of test DNA template (pA1io.CAT.ERE), 100 ng of internal control DNA, pB1(−41/+8).CAT8+, and 15 μg of B3.2 nuclear extracts. Reactions were performed as described previously (29Corthésy B. Wahli W. DNA Protein Eng. Tech. 1989; 2: 68-71Google Scholar), and the transcription products were detected by primer extension using a CAT gene-specific primer complementary to the 30 first nucleotides of the CAT gene. The organization of the 5′-flanking region of the vtg A1 gene is shown in Fig. 1 A. This gene contains two transcription initiation start sites, determined by two different TATA box-containing promoters positioned 1.8 kbp apart, termed i and io for the coding region proximal and distal initiation sites, respectively. The three imperfect estrogen response elements (EREs) are located at positions −663, −375, and −333, i.e. between the two promoters, but physically closer to the i site. Of these three EREs, only the two downstream elements have been shown to be important for the activation of the promoter in B3.2 cells (20Tremea F. Batistuzzo de Medeiros S.R. ten Heggeler-Bordier B. Germond J.E. Seiler-Tuyns A. Wahli W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1596-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Both transcription initiation start sites have been shown previously to be functional in in vitrotranscription assays using either whole or nuclear HeLa cell extracts. In addition, both sites are estrogen receptor- and estradiol-inducible as determined by S1 nuclease analysis using i - and io -specific primers on RNAs extracted from ER-transfected and estradiol-treated B3.2 cells or from liver of estradiol-stimulatedXenopus (20Tremea F. Batistuzzo de Medeiros S.R. ten Heggeler-Bordier B. Germond J.E. Seiler-Tuyns A. Wahli W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1596-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). However, no ERE has been detected up to 2 kbp upstream of the io promoter. Importantly, in the transfection experiments, estrogen inducibility of the io promoter was demonstrated from a template that contains approximately 2 kbp of the A1 promoter (construct pA1(−1995/+6).CAT), i.e.comprising only 200 bp of sequence upstream of the io transcription start site (20Tremea F. Batistuzzo de Medeiros S.R. ten Heggeler-Bordier B. Germond J.E. Seiler-Tuyns A. Wahli W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1596-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). As no ERE is present upstream of the io promoter, we were interested in examining the transcription factors that are responsible for the significant in vitro transcription activity observed from the upstream io promoter and also to understand the mechanism by which the estrogen receptor confers inducibility to this promoter. Computer-aided analysis of the 200 bp immediately upstream of the io transcription start site revealed the existence of several potential cis-acting elements. Of these, the most evident are three GC-rich motifs situated between positions −1862 and −1848 (numbering of the positions is with respect to the major transcription initiation site i of the vtg A1 gene promoter). These GC motifs have sequences corresponding to the consensus Sp1 binding site. In addition, the position of these GC boxes with respect to the initiation site conforms to the criteria previously proposed for Sp1 sites in promoters (30Kadonaga J.T. Jones K.A. Tjian R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 20-23Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (878) Google Scholar). Of interest also is the presence of a PuF binding site (31Postel E.H. Mango S.E. Flint S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5123-5133Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) at positions −1928 to −1917, a sequence with good homology to the Drosophila hunchback binding site (32Treisman J. Desplan C. Nature. 1989; 341: 335-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) at positions −1896 to −1882 and a CCAAT factor (NF-Y) binding site (33Faber M. Sealy L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22243-22254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at positions −1939 to −1930 (see Fig.1 A). In this work, we have analyzed the role of the GC boxes. First, we determined whether the sequence of the io promoter, containing the three GC-rich motifs, is recognized by Sp1 or other DNA-binding protein factors present in Xenopus-derived nuclear extracts. Thus, nuclear extracts either from the Xenopus B3.2 cell line, or fromXenopus female hepatocytes were tested by EMSA using as probe a 64-bp (Sp1-24) fragment containing the GC-rich sequences of the io promoter. As shown in Fig. 1, nuclear extracts either from B3.2 cells (Fig. 1 B), or from hepatocytes (Fig.1 C), contain an activity that specifically binds to the 64-bp probe, forming the Ca complex in gel retardation assays. The binding to the probe was efficiently competed by an excess of either unlabeled Sp1-24 fragment or by an unlabeled fragment (Sp1-CAT) containing the five GC boxes from the SV40 early promoter, which are known to bind Sp1 (34Kadonaga J.T. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5889-5893Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). As a control, the ESV40 fragment that contains no GC boxes was not able to compete for the Ca complex, even at a 250-fold molar excess (Fig. 1, B and C). In contrast, the nonspecific complex, Cx, which appears only with the B3.2 extracts, was efficiently competed with the ESV40 fragment (Fig.1 B). Faster migrating minor complexes that appear to be specifically competed by GC box containing DNA sequences (Fig. 1,B and C) could represent either degradation products of the major binding activity (Ca) or distinct GC box-binding proteins. Specific binding of the nuclear extract activity to the GC sequences of the Sp1-24 fragment was demonstrated by methylation interference experiments. As shown in Fig. 1 D, methylation of G residues in the proximal GC box of the io promoter prevents formation of the Ca complex. Consistently, methylation of the same residues did not influence formation of the nonspecific Cx complex observed with the B3.2 cell extracts (not shown). Thus, we conclude that Xenopus nuclear extracts possess an activity that can specifically recognize the proximal GC box of the io promoter. Based on the G residue methylation interference pattern, which is the same to that observed with purified Sp1 or with Sp1 from HeLa nuclear cell extracts (see below), we conclude that this activity is most likely Sp1. Additional evidence in favor of this conclusion is provided by the observation that the binding activity inXenopus hepatocytes did interact with a Sp1 binding site even when the site is CpG-methylated (Fig. 2,A and B), a property characteristic of Sp1 (Fig.2 B and Ref. 35Höller M. Westin G. Jiricny J. Schaffner W. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1127-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In contrast, as was shown previously Sp1 binding is strongly reduced on binding sites in which some guanines have been replaced by O 6-methylguanines (Fig.2 B and Ref. 36Bonfanti M. Broggini M. Prontera C. D'Incalci M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5739-5742Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). More importantly, this is also confirmed for the Sp1-like binding activity from Xenopus hepatocyte nuclear extracts (Fig. 2 C). We further characterized the biochemical properties of the binding activity in Xenopushepatocytes by assessing its specific requirement for zinc to bind DNA, using a metal reconstitution assay. When Sp1 protein is treatedin vitro with EDTA and then challenged with different metal sulfate salts, it recovers its DNA binding activity when zinc is added, but not when cobalt and nickel are added (Fig. 2 D and Ref.37Kadonaga J.T. Carner K.R. Masiarz F.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 51: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar). The Sp1-like activity in Xenopus hepatocyte nuclear extracts presents an identical behavior (Fig. 2 D). Thus, in the several tests presented so far, the analyzed activity fromXenopus nuclei, which binds to Sp1 sites, has characteristics identical to those of purified Sp1. Therefore, we conclude that, most likely, this activity is XenopusSp1. Further confirmation of the function of the io promoter GC boxes as Sp1 binding sites was provided by the use of purified Sp1 protein in DNase I footprinting and methylation interference experiments (Fig. 3). In the DNase I footprint of labeled Sp1-24 probe, Sp1 protected two regions corresponding to positions −1856 to −1847 and −1884 to −1870 of the promoter (Fig. 3 A). As shown in Fig. 1 A, this region includes the three GC boxes of the io promoter. In gel retardation assays, binding of Sp1 to the Sp1-24 probe results in two specific complexes Ca and Cb, for the faster and slower migrating complexes, respectively (Fig. 3 B). Probes partially methylated and labeled at either strand were used in EMSA with Sp1. The bound, modified probe from the above Ca and Cb complexes was isolated and subjected to piperidine cleavage. As shown in Fig. 3 B, G residue methylation in the bound probe reveals Sp1 binding to the proximal GC box in the case of the Ca complex. Similarly, with the probe isolated from complex Cb, which apparently results from multiple Sp1 molecules binding to all three GC boxes of the io promoter (Fig. 3 B), methylation was observed only in the periphery of these sequences. As expected, activity present in HeLa cell nuclear extracts interacted with the Sp1-24 probe resulting in an EMSA complex that could be supershifted with an antibody directed against human Sp1 (Fig. 3 C, left panel). Methylation interference experiments revealed that the HeLa Sp1 activity interacts with the proximal GC box of the io promoter (Fig.3 C). It is important to note that the same methylation interference pattern is observed on this sequence irrespective of the origin of the binding activity, i.e. nuclear extracts fromXenopus or HeLa cells, or purified Sp1 (compare Figs.1 D, 3 B, and 3 C). From the above it is concluded that Sp1, purified or from HeLa nuclear extracts, is able to recognize and specifically bind to the GC boxes of the io promoter. In addition, the activity present in the Ca EMSA complex from either hepatocyte or B3.2 nuclear cell extracts (Fig. 1, Band C) is most likely the Xenopus homolog of Sp1, as already demonstrated above. The human Sp1 monoclonal antibody could not cross-react with the Xenopus activity either in EMSA or Western blots (not shown), suggesting that the sequence corresponding to the antigen epitope is not well conserved between these two species. This is not surprising considering that the antibody is directed against an 18-residue-long peptide fragment of the human Sp1 protein. Binding of transcription factors to their cognate sites on a promoter is not sufficient to imply activation of the promoter by this factor. To ascertain that Sp1 is involved in the transcriptional activation of the io promoter, we employed two different experimental approaches. First, we performed transient transfection experiments in the Drosophila-derived cell line SL-2 with a reporter plasmid containing the io promoter cloned upstream of the CAT gene coding sequence (construct pio.CAT, see scheme in Fig.4 A) and a Sp1 expression vector. The choice of this particular cell line was justified, because, unlike the mammalian-derived cell lines where Sp1 is ubiquitous, it lacks endogenous Sp1 activity (8Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 A, the activation of the io promoter, as measured by the level of CAT activity, can be amplified by at least 20-fold when the reporter plasmid is cotransfected with the Sp1 expression vector. In contrast, the basal activity of the vtg B1 gene proximal promoter (promoter positions −41 to 8), that does not contain Sp1 sites (38Corthésy B. Car"

We investigated the mechanism of activation of ICa-NS in insulinoma cells using specific pharmacological reagents, and these studies further support an identity between MTX- and GLP-1-activated currents. ICa-NS is inhibited by extracellular application of genistein, econazole, and SKF 96365. This inhibition by genistein suggests that tyrosine phophorylation may play a role in the activation of ICa-NS. ICa-NS is not inhibited by incubation of cells in glucose-free solution, by extracellular tetrodotoxin, nimodipine, or tetraethylammonium, or by intracellular dialysis with 4-aminopyridine, ATP, ryanodine, or heparin. ICa-NS is also not significantly inhibited by staurosporine, which does, however, partially inhibit the MTX-induced rise of intracellular Ca2+ concentration. These effects of staurosporine suggest that protein kinase C may not be involved in the activation of ICa-NS but that it may regulate intracellular Ca2+ release. Alternatively, ICa-NS may have a small component that is carried through separate divalent cation-selective channels that are inhibited by staurosporine. ICa-NS is neither activated nor inhibited by dialysis with KF, KF + AlF3 or GTPγS (guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate)), suggesting that GTP-binding proteins do not play a major role in the activation of this current.

Individual β-cells, however, are often unresponsive to glucose alone, but can become responsive by combined stimulation with glucose and hormones, such as insulinotropic hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1; Ref. 2Holz G.G. Kuhtreiber W.M. Habener J.F. Nature. 1993; 361: 362-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar), that elevate intracellular cAMP levels (3Drucker D.J. Philippe J. Mojsov S. Chick W.L.

One mechanism underlying this increased responsiveness is the enhanced closure of K+ATP channels (2Holz G.G. Kuhtreiber W.M. Habener J.F. Nature. 1993; 361: 362-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). A second mechanism by which GLP-1, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), and cAMP can induce β-cell depolarization is through the activation of voltage-independent, non-selective cation currents (6Leech C.A. Holz G.G. Habener J.F. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1530-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 7Holz G.G., IV Leech C.A. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17749-17757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Similar cation currents are also activated by MTX, a polyether toxin isolated from dinoflagellates that in β-cells has been shown to stimulate insulin secretion and inositol trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) production (8Soergel D.G. Gusovsky F. Yasumoto T. Daly J.W. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 255: 1360-1365PubMed Google Scholar) and to enhance the influx of monovalent cations (9Murata M. Gusovsky F. Yasumoto T. Daly J.W. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 227: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). MTX-sensitive currents are activated by depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores (10Worley III, J.F. McIntyre M.S. Spencer B. Dukes I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32055-32058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and GLP-1 enhances intracellular Ca2+ mobilization through the potentiation of ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release in βTC3 cells (11Gromada J.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Increased cAMP levels stimulate Ca2+ release from secretory granules and reduce mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in β-cells (13Hahn H.J. Gylfe E. Hellman B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 630: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 14Wolters G.H.J. Pasma A. Wiegman J.B. Konijnendijk W. Diabetes. 1984; 33: 409-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). These observations raise the possibility that the activation of non-selective cation currents by PACAP and GLP-1 may be a secondary consequence of glucose- and cAMP-dependent intracellular Ca2+release. The physiological role of Ca2+ release-activated currents in β-cells remains controversial, but such currents have been suggested to play a role in the cholinergic modulation of electrical bursting activity (15Bertram R. Smolen P. Sherman A. Mears D. Atwater I. Martin F. Soria B. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 1-10Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and may control the membrane potential and intracellular Ca2+([Ca2+] i) oscillations in response to nutrient stimulation (10Worley III, J.F. McIntyre M.S. Spencer B. Dukes I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32055-32058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both PACAP (16Yada T. Sakurada M. Ihida K. Nakata M. Murata F. Arimura A. Kikuchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1290-1293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and GLP-1 (17Fehmann H.C. Goke R. Goke B. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 390-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar) are potent insulin secretagogues in the presence of slightly elevated glucose levels. The activation of a voltage-independent, non-selective cation current by these hormones under conditions that stimulate insulin secretion suggests that this current may play an important role in depolarizing β-cells to initiate insulin secretion. The aim of this study is to examine the mechanism of activation of the MTX-sensitive current and to compare the properties of ICa-NS with the current activated by GLP-1, PACAP, and cAMP to determine whether these currents are likely to be carried through the same channels. HIT-T15 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. βTC6 cells were obtained from Dr. Shimon Efrat (Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, NY). HIT-T15 cells (passages 67–75) were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10 mm glucose, 10% heat-inactivated horse serum, and 2.5% fetal bovine serum. βTC6 cells (passages 24–59) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm glucose, 15% horse serum, and 2.5% fetal bovine serum. Culture media also contained 100 units/ml penicillin G and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were plated onto glass coverslips coated with 1 mg/ml of type V concanavalin A (Sigma), which facilitates their adherence to glass. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere incubator, and experiments were conducted 1–5 days post-plating. Cells were bathed in a standard extracellular solution (SES) containing: 138 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 2.6 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES (295 mosm; pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH, approximately 4 mm), and 0.8 mmd-glucose unless indicated as being different in the text. Na+-free,N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMG) solutions were prepared using 138 mm NMG substituted for NaCl and adjusted to pH 7.4 with HCl. A Na+-free, 100 Ca solution was also prepared containing: 100 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES (282 mosm; pH adjusted to 7.4 with KOH, approximately 6 mm) Other test solutions were prepared by substitution of NaCl with 140 mm KCl, CsCl, LiCl, or choline chloride. Ca2+-free solutions were prepared by substituting MgCl2 or MnCl2 for CaCl2. Low [Cl−] o solution was prepared by substituting NaCl with Na-aspartate. Test solutions containing MTX were applied to individual cells by focal application from micropipettes using a PicoSpritzer II pressure ejection system (General Valve, Fairfield, NJ). A gravity-fed bath superfusion system was used to exchange and refresh bath solutions. Maitotoxin, econazole, staurosporine, nimodipine, and glyburide were obtained from Sigma. Tetrodotoxin, SKF 96365, genistein, GTPγS, ryanodine, and heparin were obtained from Calbiochem. Tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA) and 4-aminopyridine (4AP) were obtained from Aldrich. Cells were prepared for measurement of [Ca2+] i by incubation in fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (fura-2 AM; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Cells were loaded in SES supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum, 0.03% pluronic F-127, and 1 μm fura-2 AM for 15 min at room temperature (20–22 °C). Coverslips with fura-loaded adherent cells formed the base of a recording chamber mounted on a temperature-controlled stage (Micro Devices, Jenkintown, PA). Cells were visualized using a Zeiss IM35 microscope equipped with a Nikon UVF100 100× objective. Measurements of [Ca2+] i were performed at 1-s intervals from the average of 10 video frames using a dual excitation wavelength video imaging system (IonOptix Corp., Milton, MA). Experiments were conducted at 32 °C. [Ca2+] i was estimated from the ratio of 510 nm emission fluorescences due to excitation by 350 nm and 380 nm wavelength light from the following equation (18Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J.

Values of β, R min, andR max were determined using fura-2 pentapotassium salt and calibration solutions from Molecular Probes, Inc. Cell resting potentials and membrane currents were measured under current clamp or voltage clamp using either whole-cell or perforated patch configurations (19Horn R. Marty A. J. Gen.

Patch pipettes pulled from borosilicate glass (Kimax-51, tip resistance 2–4 megohms) were fire polished and tip-dipped in K- or Cs-pipette solution containing: 95 mmK2SO4 (or Cs2SO4), 7 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES (pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH; final concentration of Na+ approximately 2 mm). Pipettes were then back-filled with the same solution, to which nystatin (240 μg/ml) was added for perforated patch recording. The patch pipette was connected to an Heka Electronik EPC-9 patch clamp amplifier (Instrutech Corp., Mineola, NY) interfaced with a Macintosh Quadra 840AV computer running Pulse version 8.0 software (Instrutech Corp.). The series resistance (R s) and cell capacitance (C m) were monitored following seal formation, and experiments were conducted whenR s declined to <35 megohms. In voltage clamp experiments, R s was compensated for by 60%. Values are given as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined using Student's t test computed using Lotus 1–2-3 spreadsheets. MTX activates a non-selective cation current in βTC6 cells (Fig.1) that has a reversal potential of -7.8 ± 1.0 mV (n = 72) in SES (142 mm[Na+] o). This current was observed in all cells tested, and its reversal potential becomes more negative as [Na+] o is reduced (Fig. 1, TableI), although the shift is less than predicted from the Nernst potential for Na+. ICa-NS is also observed in solutions where extracellular Na+ is replaced by Cs+, K+, Li+, choline+, or NMG+ and in cells dialyzed with K+, Cs+, Na+, choline+, or NMG+ with Na+ in the bathing solution (TableII), confirming the non-selective nature of this current. Changing from normal [Cl−] o to low [Cl−] o extracellular solution did not affect the amplitude or reversal potential of the current (data not shown), confirming the cation selectivity of ICa-NS.Table ISodium dependence of I Ca-NS reversal potential (mV)142 Na70 Na/70 NMG70 Na/50 Ca14 Na/NMGNa-free/NMGNa-free/100 Ca−7.8 ± 1.0 (72)−6.0 ± 3.7 (5)−21.6 ± 2.1−4.6 ± 2.1 (5)−30.6 ± 2.9−3.4 ± 1.2 (5)−38.4 ± 2.5−13.6 ± 3.3 (6)−39.7 ± 1.8−1.4 ± 0.5 (9)−25.0 ± 1.4Table shows the effect of changing [Na+] o on the reversal potential (mV) of the MTX-activated current (ICa-NS) in βTC6 cells.

It is reported that Ca2+ is impermeant through MTX-activated channels in mouse β-cells (10Worley III, J.F. McIntyre M.S. Spencer B. Dukes I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32055-32058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in contrast with a report that Ca2+ is permeant through such channels in mouse L-cells (21Estacion M. Nguyen H.B. Gargus J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1145-C1152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore decided to re-examine the Ca2+permeability of ICa-NS. Ca2+ influx through MTX-sensitive channels in HIT-T15 cells is suggested by an increase of [Ca2+] i when hyperpolarizing voltage steps are applied following activation of the MTX-sensitive current and by the rapid and reversible fall of [Ca2+] i when extracellular Ca2+ is removed (Figs. 2 and3 A). Fig. 2 shows that a hyperpolarizing voltage clamp step from −70 mV to −100 mV had no effect on [Ca2+] i in a HIT-T15 cell before stimulation with MTX, but that similar voltage steps applied after activation of ICa-NS resulted in a pronounced increase of [Ca2+] i that was reversibly abolished by removal of extracellular Ca2+. Hyperpolarizing pulses applied following activation of non-selective cation currents by GLP-1 (22Leech C.A. Holz G.G. Habener J.F. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Panel A shows simultaneous recordings of membrane current (top trace) and [Ca2+] i (lower trace) from a βTC6 cell (Cm 23.5 pF) bathed in SES and held at −70 mV in perforated patch voltage clamp using K-pipette solution. Bath perfusion with Ca2+-free solution (50 μm EGTA, indicated by bar) produces a small reduction of [Ca2+] i from 138 nm to 118 nm and a small increase in the holding current, these effects are reversed by perfusion with SES. A 10-s pulse of 50 pm MTX induces an inward current and rise of [Ca2+] i. The rise of [Ca2+] i was rapidly and reversibly reduced by bath perfusion with Ca2+-free solution (bar). ICa-NS was slightly reduced by the Ca2+-free solution in this cell. The βTC6 cell shown in B(Cm 7.7 pF) was bathed in SES plus 5 mm TEA, 1 μm TTX, and 1 μm nimodipine and was held at −70 mV using Cs-pipette solution. An inward current developed, and [Ca2+] i fell from 52 nm to 41 nm during bath perfusion with Ca2+-free solution (50 μm EGTA plus TEA, TTX, and nimodipine, indicated by bar). The reversal potential of the current was estimated from voltage ramps (r, data not shown) to be −13 mV. The current rapidly inactivates when SES is reintroduced into the bath and [Ca2+] i increases to 95 nm. A subsequent pulse of 50 pm MTX (30 s, starting atarrow) activates an inward current (reversal potential −12 mV) and a rise in [Ca2+] i. Panel Cshows that activation of ICa-NS increases Mn2+quenching of intracellular fura-2 fluorescence. This HIT-T15 cell (Cm 38.8 pF) was bathed in SES plus 5 mm TEA, 1 μm TTX, and 1 μm nimodipine and was held at −70 mV using Cs-pipette solution. Application of a 60-s pulse of Ca2+-free, Mn2+-substituted solution before MTX produces a gradual quenching of fura-2 fluorescences (i andii), a small increase in the holding current (iii) similar to that seen in panel A,i, with little change in the fluorescence ratio (iv). Stimulation with MTX (1-s pulse, arrow) activates the inward current and rise in [Ca2+] i, and a subsequent 60-s pulse of the Ca2+-free, Mn2+-substituted solution produces rapid quenching of fura-2 fluorescence (i and ii) and a fall in [Ca2+] i (iv) with little effect on membrane current (iii).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We further tested the effects of removal of extracellular Ca2+ to confirm the activation of MTX-sensitive currents by Ca2+-free solutions (10Worley III, J.F.

In 15/18 cells tested, bath perfusion with a Ca2+-free solution containing 50 μm EGTA (the Ca2+ concentration in this solution was measured (using K5 fura-2) to be 150 nm) before stimulation with MTX caused a small, reversible increase of the membrane current and a fall of [Ca2+] i (Fig. 3 A). Holding currents at −70 mV increased from −0.96 ± 0.16 pA/pF in SES to −1.64 ± 0.30 pA/pF (p = 0.005) and [Ca2+] i decreased from 117 ± 15 nm to 99 ± 15 nm on removal of extracellular Ca2+ (not statistically significant,p = 0.4). In 3/18 cells the holding current showed a much larger increase on transfer to Ca2+-free solution (Fig. 3 B). The holding current in these cells increased by −21.8 ± 4.3 pA/pF and [Ca2+] i reduced from 75 ± 15 nm to 37 ± 4 nm(p = 0.1). This current inactivates rapidly, and [Ca2+] i is transiently elevated when SES (2.6 mm Ca2+) is reintroduced to the bath (Fig.3 B). Elevation of [Ca2+] i and activation of a non-selective cation current were also observed in a similar subset of cells following stimulation with thapsigargin (2–10 μm, data not shown), as reported previously (10Worley III, J.F. McIntyre M.S. Spencer B. Dukes I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32055-32058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bath perfusion with Ca2+-free solution after the activation of ICa-NS results in a rapid, reversible fall of [Ca2+] i but has only a small effect on the current amplitude (Figs. 2 and 3 A). The reversal potential of the MTX-activated current in Ca2+-free solution is −10.1 ± 2.8 mV (n = 12), not significantly different (p = 0.43) from the reversal potential measured in SES. These data suggest that Ca2+-influx carries only a small proportion of the current through MTX-sensitive channels in the presence of Na+. However, the rapid and reversible effects of removing extracellular Ca2+ on [Ca2+] i suggests that ICa-NS does permit Ca2+ entry. Further evidence for the influx of divalent cations through MTX-sensitive channels is suggested by increased Mn2+quenching of intracellular fura-2 fluorescence following MTX-stimulation (Fig. 3 C). Fig. 3 C (iand ii) shows the raw fura-2 fluorescence emission values, application of a 60-s pulse of Ca2+-free, Mn2+-substituted solution before stimulation with MTX produces a gradual quenching of the fluorescence signals, a small increase in the holding current (Fig. 3 C, iii), and little or no change in the 350 nm/380 nm fluorescence ratio (Fig.3 C, iv). Following activation of the inward current and rise in [Ca2+] i, a pulse of Ca2+-free, Mn2+-substituted solution produces rapid quenching of fura-2 fluorescence (Fig. 3 C,i and ii) with little or no effect on membrane current (Fig. 3 C, iii) and reduces the fluorescence ratio (Fig. 3 C, iv), consistent with a decrease in [Ca2+] i. Similar activation of Mn2+ quenching has been observed following stimulation of insulinoma cells with PACAP (6Leech C.A. Holz G.G. Habener J.F. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1530-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), cAMP (22Leech C.A. Holz G.G. Habener J.F. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 805: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and thapsigargin (23Leech C.A. Holz G.G. Habener J.F. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar,24Bode H.P. Goke B. FEBS Lett. 1994; 339: 307-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A role for Ca2+ influx through MTX-sensitive channels is further supported by the effects of applying high [Ca2+] o solutions. A Na+-free test solution containing 100 mm Ca2+ was applied to a βTC6 cell prior to stimulation with MTX and produces a small increase of [Ca2+] i (Fig. 4), similar to the effects of applying elevated [Ca2+] o solutions to mouse islets (25Silva A.M. Rosario L.M. Santos R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17095-17103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Application of 100 mm [Ca2+] o solution following stimulation with MTX produces a pronounced inhibition of ICa-NS (Fig. 4) and a negative shift in the reversal potential of the current (Table I). This inhibition of ICa-NS by the 100 mm Ca2+ solution is accompanied by a rise of [Ca2+] i (Fig. 4). These data could be explained by Ca2+ influx through a single class of non-selective cation channel with a lower permeability to Ca2+ than to Na+ under these experimental conditions. Alternatively, ICa-NS may have two (or more) components, one component being monovalent cation selective, and the other, smaller, component being selective for divalent cations. The non-selective cation current activated by 8-bromo-cAMP in HIT-T15 cells is inhibited by whole cell dialysis with Ca2+-free, EGTA-buffered solutions or by loading the cells with BAPTA (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid), a Ca2+ chelator (7Holz G.G., IV Leech C.A. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17749-17757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) leading us to test the dependence of ICa-NS activation on [Ca2+] i (Fig.5). Whole cell recordings from HIT-T15 cells were performed with either normal K-pipette solution (nominally Ca2+-free) or the same solution with 5 mm EGTA added (Ca2+-free). Whole cell dialysis with Ca2+-free intracellular solution inhibited activation of ICa-NS compared with control cells from the same platings dialyzed with nominally Ca2+-free solution or compared with cells in perforated patch voltage clamp (Fig. 5). These observations suggest that physiological [Ca2+] i levels are required for activation of the current. It is notable that dialysis of the cells with Ca2+-free solution does not induce activation of the current alone, whereas dialysis with this solution might be expected to deplete intracellular Ca2+ stores and thus activate store-operated currents. Ca2+-activated non-selective cation (Ca-NS) channels are expressed in β-cells that are activated at cytosolic [Ca2+] > 10−4m and are blocked by 1 mm ATP and also by 10 mm 4AP when applied to the cytosolic face of isolated, inside-out patches (26Sturgess N.C. Hales C.N. Ashford M.L.J. FEBS Lett. 1986; 208: 397-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 27Sturgess N.C. Hales C.N. Ashford M.L.J. Pflugers Arch. 1987; 409: 607-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Activation of ICa-NS is observed with physiological [Ca2+] i levels but inhibition of the current by dialysis of cells with Ca2+-free solutions suggests that it may be carried through Ca-NS channels. To test this possibility, βTC6 cells were bathed in glucose-free SES with 5 mm TEA and 10 nm glyburide added (to block Ca2+-activated K+ channels and K+ATP channels) and dialyzed in the whole cell recording mode with K-pipette solution and 10 mm 4AP either with or without 2 mm ATP. MTX-induced currents in cells dialyzed without ATP had a mean peak amplitude of −23.6 ± 7.9 pA/pF (n = 6), and cells from the same platings dialyzed with 2 mm ATP had peak amplitudes of −22.5 ± 7.5 pA/pF (n = 6, not significantly different, p = 0.9). These data indicate that activation of ICa-NS is not glucose-dependent, consistent with previous reports of MTX-stimulated, glucose-independent insulin secretion (28Lebrun P. Hermann M. Yasumoto T. Herchuelz A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 144: 172-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). These differences in the sensitivity of ICa-NS to [Ca2+] i and to block by ATP and 4AP in whole cell recordings compared with inside-out patches may indicate that ICa-N"

Mammalian reoviruses are members of the Reoviridaefamily, and since their genome is made up of 10 segments of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) 1The abbreviations used are: dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; NTP, nucleoside 5′-triphosphate; dNTP, deoxynucleoside 5′-triphosphate; NTPase, nucleoside triphosphate phosphohydrolase; dNTPase, deoxynucleoside triphosphate phosphohydrolase. and replicates in the cytoplasm, they must encode their own transcriptional and replicative enzymes (1Nibert M.L. Schiff L.A. Fields B.N. Fundamental Virology. 3rd Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 691-730Google Scholar). During reovirus infection, the viral genome remains in the inner capsid (core) of the virus, composed of two major (λ1 and ς2) and two minor (λ3 and μ2) proteins. Gene reassortment experiments have resulted in the assignment of transcriptase activity to λ3 (2Drayna D. Fields B.N. J. Virol. 1982; 41: 110-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although functions of other core proteins have not been firmly established, it is suspected that additional enzymatic functions are needed to achieve transcription and replication of the viral genome. For example, it has been postulated, by analogy with other viruses, that a helicase function could be present in the viral core (1Nibert M.L. Schiff L.A. Fields B.N. Fundamental Virology. 3rd Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 691-730Google Scholar). Nucleic acid helicases unwind double-stranded DNA and/or RNA, a process energetically coupled to the hydrolysis of nucleoside 5′-triphosphates (NTPs) or deoxynucleoside 5′-triphosphates (dNTPs) (3Matson S.W.

These proteins are characterized by seven conserved motifs designated I, Ia, and II-VI (15Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Donchenko A.P. Blinov V.M. Nature. 1988; 333: 22Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Motifs I and II are very well conserved and correspond to the A and B consensus sequences of a nucleotide-binding domain (16Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4269) Google Scholar). Superfamily II includes an expanding group of DNA and RNA helicases that harbor a DEA(D/H) sequence in motif II (17Schmidt S.R. Linder P. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). The sequences present in motifs III–V are less strictly conserved, and their roles are not clearly defined, whereas motif VI is supposed to be involved in nucleic acid binding given its high content of positively charged amino acids (13Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1989; 3: 419-429Crossref Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). The λ1 protein, a major component of the reovirus core, exhibits an affinity for dsRNA and dsDNA in filter binding assays and can also bind single-stranded RNA in gel retardation assays (18Lemay G. Danis C. J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 75: 3261-3266Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). 2M. Bisaillon and G. Lemay, submitted for publication. Furthermore, analysis of gene reassortment has recently resulted in the assignment of NTPase activity present in reovirus cores to the L3 gene encoding λ1 (19Noble S. Nibert M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we present a biochemical characterization of the enzymatic activities exhibited by the λ1 protein encoded by the cloned L3 gene. The protein was expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris and recovered by chromatography using the affinity of the protein for zinc, which is conferred by its zinc-finger motif. This protein was able to hydrolyze all NTPs and dNTPs with release of inorganic phosphate; however, different NTPs and dNTPs are utilized with various efficiencies. The protein can also unwind double-stranded nucleic acid molecules; this reaction requires the presence of a NTP or dNTP at a concentration consistent with a functional coupling between hydrolysis of nucleotide and helicase activity. These findings strongly support the idea that λ1 participates as a helicase during transcription of the viral genome. The methylotrophic yeastP. pastoris strain GS115 (his4) was used for the expression of λ1. All manipulations were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The 5′-end of the cloned L3 gene encoding λ1 was first reconstructed by polymerase chain reaction to remove homopolymers introduced in the original cloning procedure (20Bartlett J.A. Joklik W.K. Virology. 1988; 167: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The λ1 expression plasmid pHIL-L3 was then constructed by inserting the complete L3 gene of reovirus serotype 3 at the uniqueEcoRI site of the pHIL-D2 expression vector. The pHIL-D2 expression vector contains a HIS4 gene, and its uniqueEcoRI site is flanked by the 5′- and 3′-regulatory sequences of the methanol-inducible alcohol oxidase gene (AOX1) ofP. pastoris. Yeast cells were transformed with linear (NotI-digested) DNA of pHIL-D2 or pHIL-L3 and selected on histidine-deficient medium. Transformants were identified, liquid cultures were prepared, and protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.5% methanol for 20 h at 30 °C. The yeast cells were recovered by centrifugation and disrupted with glass beads, and the lysates (1 ml) were submitted to affinity chromatography on zinc chelate affinity adsorbent columns (Boehringer Mannheim). The columns were washed extensively (100 ml) with wash buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 150 mm NaCl), and the bound proteins were eluted sequentially with 1 ml of elution buffers, each made of 0.1m sodium phosphate and 0.8 m NaCl and adjusted at pH 7.5, 7.0, 6.5, 6.0, or 5.5 (21Porath J. Carlsson J. Olsson I. Belfrage G. Nature. 1975; 258: 598-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar). Protein dosage was performed using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Proteins were submitted to electrophoresis on SDS-10% polyacrylamide gels. Following electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose filter and probed with a 1:1000 dilution of monospecific anti-λ1 antibody (a generous gift of Dr. Michael R. Roner, Florida Atlantic University). The antigen-antibody complexes were detected using a goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and the Amersham enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting kit. Standard reactions (22Broyles S.S. Moss B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) were performed in a buffer containing 30 mm Hepes-KOH, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP (4500 Ci/mmol; ICN). Approximately 18 fmol (2.5 ng) of λ1 protein were used in each 15-μl reaction when an enriched λ1 fraction recovered from zinc affinity chromatography was used. The reactions were incubated at various temperatures and stopped by the addition of 0.1 m EDTA at the times indicated. The ATPase activity was detected by the release of32Pi from [γ-32P]ATP. Reaction products (2 μl) were applied onto plastic-backed polyethyleneimine cellulose sheets (Aldrich) and separated by ascending chromatography in 0.375 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 3.5. The sheets were then air-dried and subjected to autoradiography. The Michaelis-Menten constant (K m) was determined by the isotopic dilution method with unlabeled ATP. A similar experiment was performed with [γ-32P]GTP (4500 Ci/mmol; ICN) and unlabeled GTP. The determination of K m for dATP and dCTP was performed with 0.2 pmol of [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol; ICN) or [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol; ICN) using isotopic dilution with unlabeled dATP and dCTP, respectively. In these two cases, deoxynucleoside triphosphate substrates were separated from deoxynucleoside diphosphate reaction products by polyethyleneimine cellulose chromatography in 0.8 m acetic acid and 0.9m LiCl buffer. The spots corresponding to the radiolabeled substrates or reaction products were identified following autoradiography; the corresponding regions were then excised from the polyethyleneimine cellulose sheets; and the radioactivity was measured by Cerenkov counting. For calculations, background values were first subtracted from product values by quantitation of radioactivity at the same level on chromatograms of control unincubated substrate. Thereafter, the ratio of generated products to total material was calculated by quantitation of both reaction products and residual substrate in each lane. The substrate for the DNA helicase assay was prepared by annealing the 17-base pair universal primer (5′-GTAAAACGACGGCCAGT-3′) to single-stranded M13 DNA. Chain elongation was then performed with Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of dGTP, dTTP, and [α-32P]dATP. The resulting substrate contained an extended radiolabeled oligomer of 22 nucleotides hybridized to M13 DNA and was purified by gel filtration (Sephadex G-25) to remove most of the unincorporated nucleotides. The substrate for RNA helicase activity was prepared as a partial RNA duplex using pBluescript II SK+ (Stratagene), which contains the T3 and T7 polymerase promoters. The first strand (59 nucleotides) was prepared by in vitro transcription with T3 RNA polymerase (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) of the SmaI-digested plasmid. The labeled strand (89 nucleotides) was synthesized from theXbaI-digested plasmid in the presence of [α-32P]UTP with T7 RNA polymerase (Pharmacia). The original DNA templates were removed by DNase treatment (RQ1 DNase, RNase-free), extracted in phenol/chloroform, and precipitated with ethanol. The two RNA species were dissolved in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 200 mm NaCl. The RNAs were then annealed by heating to 90 °C for 15 min and cooled to room temperature to produce a tailed RNA molecule with a 17-base pair duplex region. In the standard assay (23Im D.S. Muzyczka N. Cell. 1990; 61: 447-457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), the DNA and RNA substrates (0.3 pmol) were used in a total volume of 15 μl containing 25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 5 mmMgCl2, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 5 mm ATP. Approximately 18 fmol (2.5 ng) of λ1 protein were used in each 15-μl reaction when the enriched λ1 fraction recovered from zinc affinity chromatography was used; incubation was for 30 min at 37 °C. Components were added or removed in some reactions, as described below. The reactions were stopped by adding 0.5% SDS, 50 mm EDTA, and 40% glycerol. The reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 15% (DNA) or 10% (RNA) nondenaturing Tris borate/EDTA-polyacrylamide gels. The gels were dried under vacuum and exposed for autoradiography. Sequence comparisons revealed that λ1 possesses two nucleotide-binding motifs normally present in NTPase (Fig. 1): a PRKTKGKS sequence (A site) in the N-terminal region and a DEAD motif (B site). Furthermore, λ1 harbors the characteristic motifs found in members of the RNA/DNA helicase superfamily II, with slight variations occurring in certain motifs. To study these putative enzymatic activities, the λ1 protein encoded by the cloned L3 gene was expressed using theP. pastoris yeast expression system as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Enrichment of the protein and removal of endogenous yeast ATPases were then achieved by affinity chromatography, taking advantage of the presence of a putative zinc-binding finger motif on λ1. The expression level of λ1 was too low for detection by either Coomassie Blue or silver staining in the purified fractions (data not shown). However, immunoblotting analysis, using a monospecific anti-λ1 antibody, did reveal the enrichment of an immunoreactive protein in the eluted fractions; this protein comigrated with the authentic λ1 protein found in purified reovirions (Fig.2 A). The amount of λ1 protein in these fractions was estimated to be ∼0.5 ng/μl by comparisons with the signal obtained by immunoblotting using serial dilutions of purified reovirus as a standard. Protein dosage also revealed that enrichment of the protein was ∼10-fold compared with the crude lysate (TableI).Table ISummary of λ1 protein enrichmentChromatography stepVolumeTotal proteinλ1 proteinATPase1-aOne unit is defined as the amount of enzyme that will generate 1 fmol of inorganic phosphate/min.Specific activitymlmgngunitsunits/mgpHIL-D2 crude lysate102500254010.2pHIL-D2 eluate fraction1-bThis is the eluate fraction obtained at pH 7.5.12.5000pHIL-L3 crude lysate102508000380015.2pHIL-L3 eluate fraction1-bThis is the eluate fraction obtained at pH 7.5.12.5500340136Aliquots from crude lysates or eluate fractions from affinity chromatography steps were assayed for ATPase activity.

The amount of λ1 protein was estimated by comparisons with the signal obtained by immunoblotting using serial dilutions of purified reovirus as a standard. The volumes listed represent total volumes of each fraction. The λ1 protein expressed in P. pastoris was first tested for its ability to hydrolyze ATP by monitoring the amount of free radioactive inorganic phosphate liberated upon incubation of the protein fractions with [γ-32P]ATP. As shown in Fig. 2(B and C), ATPase activity endogenous to P. pastoris was found in the flow-through and first wash fractions of the zinc column, but dropped to undetectable levels in later wash fractions. Following elution at lower pH, ATPase activity was recovered from cultures harboring the λ1 expression vector (Fig.2 C), whereas equivalent fractions from control cultures harboring vector with no insert were devoid of ATPase activity (Fig.2 B). The same results were obtained from five independent negative cultures and two separate cultures expressing recombinant λ1 (data not shown). A summary of the λ1 enrichment procedure is presented in Table I; the eluate fraction obtained at pH 7.5 was used in the rest of this work. In an effort to further rule out any possible contamination with a copurifying yeast enzyme, thermoresistance of the NTPase activity was examined (Fig. 3). The approach used takes advantage of the fact that reovirus core enzymes are active at high temperature, whereas P. pastoris has an optimal growth temperature of 30 °C, and its enzymes are thus expected to be thermosensitive. Cell extracts from yeast cells harboring the control vector (pHIL-D2) or λ1 expression vector (pHIL-L3) were thus examined for ATPase activity prior to or following heating at 42 °C for an extended period (5 h). This treatment essentially abolished the yeast endogenous ATPase activity (Fig. 3 A), whereas part of the activity was retained in lysates from λ1-expressing yeast cells (Fig.3 B); the ATPase activity present in λ1-enriched fractions from zinc chelate affinity chromatography was completely resistant to thermal inactivation (Fig. 3 D), whereas no activity was found in eluate fractions from yeast cells harboring the control vector pHIL-D2 (Fig. 3 C). The enzymatic activity of recombinant λ1 found in elution fractions was then further investigated. This activity was absolutely dependent on the presence of the divalent cation Mg2+ or Mn2+, whereas the Ca2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+ cations were not effective cofactors (data not shown). The ATPase activity increased sharply with MgCl2concentration, reached a maximum at 2.5 mm, and was constant up to 10 mm (Fig. 4 A). Similar results were obtained when Mn2+ was substituted for Mg2+ (data not shown). To gain additional insight into the λ1-associated ATPase activity, the effect of temperature on the reaction was examined (Fig.4 B). The temperature optimum of the reaction, as judged by the maximum rate of ATP hydrolysis, was 42–50 °C; however, the activity was rapidly lost upon incubation at 50 °C. A 1-h incubation at 42, 37, and 30 °C resulted in similar rates of ATP hydrolysis, whereas the enzyme was less active at 25 °C. The kinetics parameters of the reaction were determined at 37 °C and 10 min, at which time the reaction is still proceeding at its initial rate. The ATPase reaction velocity reached a plateau at ∼7 μm ATP and exhibited a K m of 1 μm as determined by a double-reciprocal plot (Fig.4 C). Identical results were obtained in three separate experiments. To determine the substrate specificity of the λ1 protein, the hydrolysis of other ribonucleotides and deoxyribonucleotides was also tested. The protein exhibited a strong preference for adenosine nucleotides (ATP and dATP), which were hydrolyzed very efficiently. The enzyme displayed some activity on other NTPs and dNTPs tested, although the efficiency was different from one substrate to the other; the order of preference was dATP > ATP > GTP > dCTP according to the k cat values obtained with these substrates (Table II).Table IIKinetic analysis of alternative nucleoside triphosphate phosphohydrolysisSubstrateK m 2-aValues for K m andV max were determined from Lineweaver-Burk plots of hydrolysis activity.

Open table in a new tab The ability of the λ1 protein to unwind double-stranded nucleic acids was then investigated. The RNA helicase reaction catalyzed by the reovirus λ1 protein was demonstrated by strand displacement of a partial RNA duplex as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The λ1-associated RNA helicase activity required the presence of ATP, which could be substituted by either one of the NTPs and dNTPs (Fig.5 A) (data not shown). The unwinding activity was also dependent on the presence of a divalent cation (Mg2+ or Mn2+), as was the NTPase/dNTPase activity. The helicase activity on a DNA substrate was also tested by the ability of the protein to displace (unwind) a short oligonucleotide annealed to single-stranded M13 DNA. As shown in Fig. 5 B, the λ1 protein is able to unwind the partial DNA duplex in the presence of either ATP or dATP. This λ1-associated DNA helicase activity could also be stimulated by all NTPs and dNTPs (data not shown) and had the same requirement for divalent cations as the RNA helicase activity. Additional controls were also performed to ensure that the helicase activity could not be due to a copurifying yeast protein. Crude lysate from control yeast cells was examined for the presence of helicase activity and was found to be negative. Furthermore, the enriched eluate from the zinc affinity column was also negative in the control cells, whereas the activity found in purified λ1 eluate fractions was thermoresistant (Fig. 5 C), as was the NTPase activity. Our understanding of the roles of individual core proteins in reovirus replication is still incomplete, although genetic information has been accumulated during the past few years (24Coombs K.M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4237-4245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Coombs K.M. Mak S.C. Petrycky L.D. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 177-186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Investigation of the biochemical activity of the reovirus λ1 protein was inspired by sequence comparisons with other NTPase/helicase proteins. Although the λ1 protein does not show any significant similarities to other proteins, it possesses the characteristic motifs found in the DEAD subfamily of the RNA/DNA helicase superfamily II. All these motifs are located in the amino-terminal third of λ1; the affinity of the protein for nucleic acids was previously assigned to this region (18Lemay G. Danis C. J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 75: 3261-3266Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Being one of the largest reovirus proteins, the λ1 protein could not be easily expressed in bacterial expression systems. The recently described P. pastoris yeast expression system was instead used as a convenient way to produce recombinant λ1. The expression levels obtained were low but sufficient for investigations of λ1 catalytic activities. The reason for this low expression level is unknown, but might reflect toxicity of NTPase activity when overexpressed, thus resulting in the selection of cell clones expressing lower levels of the protein. Expression levels usingP. pastoris have been reported to vary widely among proteins (Invitrogen). Since a truncated form of λ1 encompassing the zinc-finger motif was previously expressed as a fusion protein in bacterial cells (18Lemay G. Danis C. J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 75: 3261-3266Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and found to attach to zinc chelate columns, 3M. Bisaillon and G. Lemay, unpublished results. this procedure was thus adequate for λ1 recovery. The zinc affinity chromatography procedure allowed us to efficiently reduce endogenous NTPase and helicase activities below the detection level of our assays while enriching both immunodetectable λ1 and its associated NTPase activity by ∼10-fold. Thermoresistance was an additional proof that the NTPase activity measured could not be due to a contaminating yeast protein; although it is expected that NTPase activity could be abundant in yeast cells, those endogenous activities were completely inactivated upon extensive heat treatment. All four NTPs and dNTPs tested were hydrolyzed by λ1, and it is most likely that all NTPs and dNTPs can be hydrolyzed since either one of them can substitute for ATP in the helicase assay. The efficiency of utilization appears to vary among the different NTPs and dNTPs, with the highest rate of hydrolysis for dATP, followed by ATP and other NTPs. However, it should be mentioned that even though allK m values are in the micromolar range, they are lower for NTPs than for dNTPs. At a low concentration of substrates, as might be the case inside the viral core in vivo, ATP will thus likely be the preferred energy source. A NTPase activity has been previously found in purified reovirus cores (19Noble S. Nibert M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Kapuler A.M. Mendelsohn N. Klett H. Acs G. Nature. 1970; 225: 1209-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 27Borsa J. Grover J. Chapman J.D. J. Virol. 1970; 6: 295-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the activity has been recently assigned to λ1 using gene reassortment analysis (19Noble S. Nibert M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the core enzyme is capable of hydrolyzing either NTPs or dNTPs in the presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+ and also has an unusual temperature optimum of 51 °C (27Borsa J. Grover J. Chapman J.D. J. Virol. 1970; 6: 295-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Kapuler A.M. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 4453-4457Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The observation that dATP was more efficiently hydrolyzed relative to ATP at high substrate concentration was also made in previous studies (19Noble S. Nibert M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Borsa J. Grover J. Chapman J.D. J. Virol. 1970; 6: 295-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytic properties of the recombinant λ1 protein analyzed in this study are consistent with these previous findings and further support the idea that λ1 is the protein responsible for the NTPase activity observed in reovirus cores. The recombinant λ1-associated NTPase/dNTPase had an apparent temperature optimum of 50 °C, but the activity declined rapidly at this high temperature, most likely due to thermal inactivation of the enzyme. Recent studies indicated that λ1 interacts with the λ3 (polymerase) and λ2 (guanylyltransferase) core proteins (29Starnes M.C. Joklik W.K. Virology. 1993; 193: 356-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 30Cashdollar L.W. Res. Virol. 1994; 145: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar); such interactions might account for the higher stability of NTPase activity found in purified viral cores compared with the isolated recombinant λ1 protein. The K m values for ATP and GTP hydrolysis calculated from Lineweaver-Burk plots were 1 and 2 μm, respectively. These K m values are in the same range observed for the well studied SV40 large T antigen, which is also a DNA and RNA helicase (31Clertant P. Gaudray P. May E. Cuzin F. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 15196-15203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To date, only three other viral helicases have been shown to possess both DNA and RNA helicase activities; they are SV40 large T antigen, vaccinia virus protein 18R, and hepatitis C virus protein NS3 (32Scheffner M.R. Knippers R. Stahl H. Cell. 1989; 57: 955-963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 33Bayliss C.D. Smith G.L. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 794-800Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Tai C.L. Chi W.K. Chen D.S. Hwang L.H. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8477-8484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One cellular eukaryotic protein, nuclear DNA helicase II, also possesses the ability to unwind dsDNA and dsRNA substrates (35Zhang S. Grosse F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3906-3912Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The reovirus λ1 protein shares with these four helicases the ability to hydrolyze all NTPs and dNTPs. However, SV40 large T antigen unwinds dsDNA when ATP is present, but unwinds dsRNA with UTP, CTP, or GTP as cofactor (32Scheffner M.R. Knippers R. Stahl H. Cell. 1989; 57: 955-963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The bound nucleotide seems to determine whether the T antigen acts as an RNA or DNA helicase. In contrast, the reovirus λ1 protein and hepatitis C virus protein NS3 can use the energy provided by the hydrolysis of any NTPs or dNTPs for both their RNA and DNA helicase activities (34Tai C.L. Chi W.K. Chen D.S. Hwang L.H. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8477-8484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Many viral helicases have high basal NTPase activity in the absence of added nucleic acids. This is the case of the potyvirus-flavivirus-pestivirus proteins that have been recently characterized (36Rikkonen M. Peränen J. Kääriäinen L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5804-5810Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Suzich J.A. Tamura J.K. Palmer-Hill F. Warrener P. Grakoui A. Rice C.M. Feinstone S.M. Collett M.S. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6152-6158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Tamura J.K. Warrener P. Collett M.S. Virology. 1993; 193: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 39Warrener P. Tamura J.K. Collett M.S. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 989-996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this respect, they differ from most cellular proteins of the NTPase/helicase superfamilies. For example, cellular protein p68 and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A exhibit almost no detectable ATPase activity in the absence of RNA (40Abramson R.D. Dever T.E. Lawson T.G. Ray B.K. Thach R.E. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3826-3832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Hirling H. Scheffner M. Restle T. Stahl H. Nature. 1989; 339: 562-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrated that the reovirus λ1 protein, like many viral NTPases, also exhibits NTPase and dNTPase activities in the absence of added nucleic acids. Although it cannot be completely excluded that nucleic acids can stimulate NTPase activity, the addition of various nucleic acids (single-stranded DNA, dsDNA, single-stranded RNA, and dsRNA) has failed to produce a significant change ink cat values for NTPase activity (data not shown). The helicase activity of λ1 was not detected at an ATP concentration of 0.1 μm and was maximal at 10 μm (data not shown). This is consistent with the K m value of 1 μm for ATPase activity and with a probable functional coupling between the two reactions where NTP or dNTP hydrolysis generates the energy required for unwinding of nucleic acids. The significance, if any, of the DNA helicase activity of the λ1 protein is currently not understood, but a previous report already demonstrated the λ1 affinity for dsRNA and dsDNA in filter binding assays (18Lemay G. Danis C. J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 75: 3261-3266Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). As previously mentioned, the NS3 protein from hepatitis C virus is another example of an RNA virus protein with an associated DNA helicase activity. Like the reovirus λ1 protein, the role of the DNA helicase activity in the multiplication cycle or pathogenesis of hepatitis C virus is not yet established (34Tai C.L. Chi W.K. Chen D.S. Hwang L.H. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8477-8484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to earlier genetic evidence that assigned transcriptase activity to λ3, more recent biochemical evidence has confirmed that this protein possesses RNA polymerase activity (29Starnes M.C. Joklik W.K. Virology. 1993; 193: 356-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, the protein appears to be unable by itself to transcribe its natural dsRNA substrate. This has led to the idea that additional proteins are involved in transcription. The λ1-associated RNA helicase activity reported in this study strongly suggests an involvement of this protein in the transcription of the double-stranded reovirus genome. Although it is possible that normal transcription and replication of the viral genome require the formation of a well structured core or the participation of cellular protein(s), this report is the third case, with the previous examples of λ2 and λ3 (29Starnes M.C. Joklik W.K. Virology. 1993; 193: 356-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 42Mao Z. Joklik W.K. Virology. 1991; 185: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), where an actual enzymatic activity could be demonstrated on a solubilized reovirus protein. To our knowledge, this report of λ1 helicase activity is the first demonstration of such an activity in a mammalian dsRNA virus. The reovirus core also contains enzymes that modify the 5′-end of newly synthesized mRNAs by adding a cap structure similar to the one present on cellular mRNAs (43Faust M. Hastings K.E.M. Millward S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1975; 197: 1329-1343Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 44Furuichi Y. Morgan M. Muthukrishnan S. Shatkin A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). An RNA triphosphatase activity (polynucleotide phosphohydrolase) is involved in the formation of the reovirus cap structure by releasing inorganic phosphate from the 5′-triphosphate end of the nascent mRNAs (1Nibert M.L. Schiff L.A. Fields B.N. Fundamental Virology. 3rd Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 691-730Google Scholar). The nature of the core protein involved in this process is currently unknown, but the λ1 protein, with its ability to release the terminal phosphate from free nucleotides, is certainly an attractive candidate to exert a similar activity on polynucleotides harboring a 5′-triphosphate end. We thank Carole Danis for expert technical assistance and Dr. Pierre Belhumeur for suggesting the use of the yeast expression system. We also thank Dr. Michael R. Roner for the generous gift of the anti-λ1 antibody."
https://openalex.org/W2121828312,"By taking advantage of the established chicken B cell line, DT40 cells, which do not express tyrosine kinase Syk or Lyn, functional roles of Syk and Lyn in apoptotic response elicited by cellular stress were investigated. DT40 cells underwent apoptosis after hyperosmotic stress. In Syk-deficient DT40 cells, this apoptotic process was significantly enhanced. Ectopic expression of wild type, but not kinase-inactive, porcine Syk in Syk-deficient cells rescued cells from osmotic stress-induced apoptosis, demonstrating that the presence of functionally active Syk is necessary to protect cells from osmotic stress-induced apoptosis. In comparison, there was no effect on osmotic stress-induced apoptosis in Lyn-deficient DT40 cells. Interestingly, while Syk was not involved in ultraviolet C (UVC)-induced apoptosis, a deficiency of Lyn rendered cells resistant to UVC irradiation. These observations defined Syk and Lyn as important mediators of apoptosis in DT40 cells in response to osmotic stress and UVC irradiation, respectively. Furthermore, osmotic stress, but not UVC irradiation, could activate c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in DT40 cells. A deficiency in either Syk or Lyn did not affect the osmotic stress-induced activation of JNK. We, therefore, concluded that Syk and Lyn regulate the apoptotic responses to osmotic stress and UVC irradiation independently of the JNK pathway in DT40 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2024413697,"Previous studies have indicated that the presence of an E2F site is not sufficient for G1/S phase transcriptional regulation. For example, the E2F sites in the E2F1 promoter are necessary, but not sufficient, to mediate differential promoter activity in G0 and S phase. We have now utilized the E2F1 minimal promoter to test several hypotheses that could account for these observations. To test the hypothesis that G1/S phase regulation is achieved via E2F-mediated repression of a strong promoter, a variety of transactivation domains were brought to the E2F1 minimal promoter. Although many of these factors caused increased promoter activity, growth regulation was not observed, suggesting that a general repression model is incorrect. However, constructs having CCAAT or YY1 sites or certain GC boxes cloned upstream of the E2F1 minimal promoter displayed E2F site-dependent regulation. Further analysis of the promoter activity suggested that E2F requires cooperation with another factor to activate transcription in S phase. However, we found that the requirement for E2F to cooperate with additional factors to achieve growth regulation could be relieved by bringing the E2F1 activation domain to the promoter via a Gal4 DNA binding domain. Our results suggest a model that explains why some, but not all, promoters that contain E2F sites display growth regulation. Previous studies have indicated that the presence of an E2F site is not sufficient for G1/S phase transcriptional regulation.

Our results suggest a model that explains why some, but not all, promoters that contain E2F sites display growth regulation. E2F plays an important role in regulating gene expression at the G1/S phase transition in the mammalian cell cycle. Promoters in which E2F sites contribute to transcriptional regulation are found in genes involved in DNA synthesis (such as dihydrofolate reductase, DNA polymerase α, and thymidine kinase) as well as in genes that are involved in cell cycle control (such as B-myb, several cyclins, and cdc2). E2F-mediated regulation of many of these genes leads to differential expression in G0 and S phase, causing low promoter activity in quiescent cells and increased activity at the G1/S phase boundary (1Slansky J.E. Farnham P.J. Farnham P.J. Transcriptional Control of Cell Growth: The E2F Gene Family. 208. Springer-Verlag, New York1996: 1-30Google Scholar). However, certain promoters contain E2F sites that do not confer growth-regulated transcriptional activity (2Hengstschläger M. Mudrak I. Wintersberger E. Wawra E. Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 1389-1394PubMed Google Scholar, 3Shan B. Chang C.Y. Jones D. Lee W.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Several models have been put forth to explain why certain E2F sites mediate growth regulation and others do not. One such model is based on the fact that E2F is a family of transcription factors of which seven members have been characterized to date. E2F1–5 can heterodimerize with either DP1 or DP2 to create functional E2F activity (4Helin K. Wu C.-L. Fattaey A.R. Lees J.A. Dynlacht B.D. Ngwu C. Harlow E. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1850-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 5Wu C.L. Zukerberg L.R. Ngwu C. Harlow E. Lees J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2536-2546Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Some of the E2Fs are present only at certain stages of the cell cycle (such as E2F1), whereas others are constitutively present (such as E2F4). Also, E2F activity is regulated by the Rb family of proteins (4Helin K. Wu C.-L. Fattaey A.R. Lees J.A. Dynlacht B.D. Ngwu C. Harlow E. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1850-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 5Wu C.L. Zukerberg L.R. Ngwu C. Harlow E. Lees J.A. Mol. Cell.

A. 1995; 92: 2403-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). E2F1–3 preferentially bind Rb, whereas E2F4 and E2F5 mainly bind p107 and p130. Thus, it is possible that growth-regulated promoters have a different composition of E2F protein complexes bound to the promoter DNA than do non-growth-regulated promoters. This model, however, cannot account for results obtained from deletion analyses of growth-regulated promoters. For example, we have shown that deletion of sequences from −410 to −90 of the mouse dihydrofolate reductase promoter can eliminate growth regulation although the E2F sites and surrounding sequences remain intact (10Slansky, J. (1995) Transcriptional Regulation of the Dihydrofolate Reductase Promoter. Ph.D. thesis, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI.Google Scholar). The fact that a particular E2F element can confer growth regulation in a given promoter, but not in a shorter version of the same promoter, suggests that subtle differences in the E2F site are not responsible for distinguishing growth-regulated versusnon-growth-regulated promoters. An alternative model of E2F-mediated growth regulation is based on the interactions of E2F-bound pocket proteins (i.e. Rb, p107, and p130) with upstream factors. Rb, p107, and p130 all contain transcription repression domains. It has been suggested that E2F-bound pocket proteins repress activity of other transcription factors bound to the promoter DNA in the G0 phase of the cell cycle. Then, as cells progress through the cell cycle, the pocket protein is phosphorylated and released from the E2F-DNA complex. This relief of repression now allows high transcriptional activity. Evidence for this model comes from mutational analysis of the E2F sites in certain promoters. For example, in the B-Myb promoter, elimination of E2F binding causes increased promoter activity in G0 phase cells (11Lam E.W.-F. Watson R.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2705-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Since not all upstream factors can be repressed by pocket proteins (12Weintraub S.J. Chow K.N.B. Luo R.X. Zhang S.H. He S. Dean D.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 812-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), the presence of a repressible upstream factor may determine whether a promoter is growth-regulated. We have previously shown that the mouse E2F1 promoter is growth-regulated and that this regulation is dependent upon two E2F sites in the promoter region (13Hsiao K.-M. McMahon S.L. Farnham P.J. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1526-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In this study it was further shown that growth regulation of this promoter was a result of E2F-mediated repression. However, deletion of the −176 to −45 region of the E2F1 promoter can eliminate growth regulation, although the E2F sites located between −40 and −10 are still present. We wished to determine the role of the upstream sequences in mediating this growth regulation. Therefore, we have examined the ability of a variety of transcription factors to reinstate growth regulation to an E2F1 minimal promoter. In contrast to a repression-based model of E2F-mediated regulation, we find that the growth-regulated promoter constructs display S phase-specific activation of transcription. Our results suggest that upstream factors determine whether or not an E2F site-containing promoter displays growth-regulated transcriptional activity and if that regulation is achieved via activation or repression. pE2F1(−45/+36)-Luc and pE2F1(−84/+36)-Luc have been described previously (13Hsiao K.-M. McMahon S.L. Farnham P.J. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1526-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). pE2F1(−45/+36ΔΔE2F)-Luc was made by polymerase chain reaction using pE2F1(−176/+36ΔΔE2F)-Luc (13Hsiao K.-M. McMahon S.L. Farnham P.J. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1526-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) as a template and primers specific for E2F1 and the vector. For synthetic promoter reporter constructs, oligonucleotides of template and nontemplate strand containing various transcription factor binding sites were hybridized and inserted into SmaI-digested pE2F1(−45/+36)-Luc or pE2F1(−45/+36ΔΔ)-Luc. The following double-stranded oligonucleotides (the transcription factor binding sites are underlined) were inserted into the constructs: the proximal CCAAT site of the E2F1 promoter at −70, 5′-CCCGAGCTCGGCCAATGGAAGCTTCCC-3′; the P5–60 YY1 site from the AAV promoter, 5′-TCGAGACGTCGTTTTTGCGACATTTTGCGACAC-3′; a consensus p53 site (14Funk W.D.

NIH 3T3 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained, transfected, serum-starved, and serum-stimulated as described (13Hsiao K.-M. McMahon S.L. Farnham P.J. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1526-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. 1.3 × 105 cells were plated into 60-mm diameter dishes in 5 ml of maintenance medium 16–20 h prior to infection. Immediately following the glycerol shock, the cells were placed in starvation medium containing 0.5% (v/v) serum. After 40–50 h, the cells were harvested or stimulated to enter the proliferative cycle by replacing the starvation medium with medium containing 10% (v/v) serum. Cells were harvested at the indicated times, and luciferase activity was measured. For the cotransfection experiments, 5 μg of reporter plasmid was transfected with a titration range of the Gal4 fusion construct and carrier DNA (15 μg of total DNA/dish). For all transfection experiments, at least two DNA preparations and at last three separate experiments were averaged for each datum point (anerror bar represents the S.E.; see Figs. 1, 2, 3 and 6).Figure 2Some, but not all, endogenous activators can confer growth regulation to the E2F1 minimal promoter.

DNA binding activity was assayed by incubating labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the Sp1 site at −77, the CCAAT site at −68, and the GC box at −50 in the E2F1 promoter with 6 μg of nuclear extract prepared from Friend cells or NIH 3T3 cells using previously described assay conditions (13Hsiao K.-M.

The binding buffers for the GC box probe and the Ea Y box probe were the same as for the Sp1 probe and the CCAAT probe, respectively. For the NF-Y supershift assays, 400 ng of anti-Ya polyclonal antibody and 200 ng of anti-Yb antibody (16Mantovani R. Pessara U. Tronche F. Li X.-Y. Knapp A.-M. Pasquali J.-L. Benoist C. Mathis D.

We have previously reported that the E2F sites in the E2F1 promoter (−176/+98) are necessary for growth-regulated transcription but that these same sites are not sufficient for growth regulation of a minimal (−45/+36) promoter region (13Hsiao K.-M. McMahon S.L. Farnham P.J. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1526-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). One hypothesis that could explain the lack of growth regulation is based on transcriptional repression. Activators that normally bind upstream of the E2F sites could create a strong promoter that can be repressed in G0 by E2F-bound pocket proteins. Truncation of the promoter would remove these activators, leaving only the two E2F sites located from −40 to −10 plus an Sp1 site located downstream of the transcription start site. It is possible that these remaining factors are not sufficient to activate transcription and so promoter activity remains low even after the pocket proteins are released from E2F. To test the generality of a repression-based model of E2F-mediated growth regulation, we determined if growth regulation could be conferred to the E2F1 minimal promoter by activators brought in as Gal4 fusion proteins. The hypothesis stated above requires the activator to confer high transcriptional activity to the minimal E2F1 promoter so that E2F can repress this activity in G0 phase cells. Therefore, we first determined if the Gal4 DNA binding domain (amino acids 1–147) fused to VP16, p53, Ets2, or MyoD could confer high activity to the minimal E2F1 promoter in S phase. Since the E2F1 promoter sequences from −84 to +36 demonstrate growth-regulated activity (11-fold; Fig.1 B), we decided that activators that provide at least as much transcriptional activity to the E2F1 minimal promoter as does the −84/−45 region would score as “potential” regulators. NIH 3T3 cells were cotransfected with Gal4-transcription factor fusion expression constructs and a luciferase reporter construct consisting of one or five Gal4 sites cloned upstream of the E2F1 minimal promoter (Fig. 1 A). For each expression construct, a titration was performed to determine optimal activation of the reporter. Each of these four acidic activators was able to activate the E2F1 promoter having a single Gal4 site, resulting in an increase in luciferase activity ranging from 15-fold (MyoD) to 59-fold (p53) over that seen using the Gal4 DNA binding domain alone (Fig. 1 B). Transcriptional activity mediated by each of these activators exceeded that mediated by the −84/−45 E2F1 promoter region. When the reporter plasmid having five Gal4 sites was used in cotransfection assays, activation by the same transcriptional activators ranged from 27-fold (MyoD) to 296-fold (VP16). To determine whether VP16, p53, Ets2, or MyoD could confer growth regulation to the minimal E2F1 promoter, the Gal4 fusion constructs were analyzed in a serum starvation and stimulation assay using the reporter plasmids described above. In this assay, cells are transfected with the DNA constructs, placed in 0.5% serum for 48–60 h (which causes the cells to arrest in G0 phase), and then stimulated to synchronously enter the cell cycle by the addition of 10% serum. Reporter activity was measured in transfected cells in both G0 and S phase (12 h after serum stimulation); growth regulation is defined as the ratio of activity in S phase of a given promoter construct divided by the activity of the same promoter construct in G0 phase. As a positive control we used the −84/+36 E2F1 promoter. The activity after serum stimulation of the −84/+36 E2F1 reporter plasmid was increased 13-fold at 12 h after serum stimulation, demonstrating that cell cycle synchrony was achieved. However, there was very little change in promoter activity in G0 versus S phase using any of the Gal4 fusion proteins (as measured with either the reporter containing one or five Gal4 sites). Therefore, the presence of these strong activators at the E2F1 minimal promoter does not confer growth regulation. Since reporter activity was high in G0 and S phase, the lack of regulation resulted primarily from a failure to repress transcriptional activity in G0 phase. Since the Gal4 fusion proteins were unable to confer regulation to the E2F1 minimal promoter, consensus transcription factor binding sites were cloned upstream of the promoter to determine if endogenous cellular factors could confer growth regulation. Oligonucleotides containing consensus CCAAT, YY1, p53, NF1, Oct1, Sp1, and AP2 sites as well as a GC element from the Rep3A promoter were cloned immediately upstream of the minimal E2F1 promoter (Fig. 2 A). As with the experiments with the Gal4 fusions, we first determined whether proteins that bind to these sites could increase E2F1 promoter activity. NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with luciferase reporter constructs consisting of consensus transcription factor sites cloned upstream of the E2F1 minimal promoter. We found that CCAAT, YY1, p53 sites, and three copies of the Rep3A GC box increased promoter activity 10-fold (CCAAT) to 300-fold (p53) over that observed from the E2F1 minimal promoter. However, one NF1, three AP2, three Oct1, and three Sp1 sites only marginally activated the E2F1 minimal promoter (Fig.2 B). We then asked whether the four different sites that could activate the E2F1 minimal promoter could confer growth regulation. Reporter constructs with CCAAT, YY1, p53, and Rep3A GC sites were analyzed in a serum starvation and stimulation assay. CCAAT, YY1, and Rep3A GC box binding sites conferred 6–8-fold growth regulation to the E2F1 minimal promoter, whereas p53 only conferred a 3-fold regulation (Fig.2 C). It is possible that certain transcription factors might mediate growth regulation in an E2F-independent manner. To address this possibility, the CCAAT, YY1, GC, and p53 sites were cloned upstream of the minimal E2F1 promoter having mutated E2F sites and tested in the serum starvation and stimulation assay. Promoter constructs with CCAAT, YY1, and Rep3A GC elements no longer showed growth regulation, indicating that regulation of these promoters was dependent upon the presence of both the E2F sites and the upstream sites. Growth regulation was mediated by the p53 binding site in the constructs having wild type or mutated E2F sites, suggesting that the small amount of growth regulation mediated by p53 was independent of E2F (Fig.2 C). The mechanism by which E2F mediates transcriptional activation has been found to differ among promoters. In the B-Myb promoter, the E2F site functions solely to repress promoter activity in G0 phase (11Lam E.W.-F. Watson R.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2705-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), whereas in the dihydrofolate reductase promoter the E2F site mediates regulation by increasing promoter activity in S phase (18Slansky J.E. Li Y. Kaelin W.G. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13 (; Correction (1993) Mol. Cell. Biol.13, 7201): 1610-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 19Fry C.J. Slansky J.E. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1966-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A characteristic of E2F-mediated repression is that mutation of the E2F site results in increased promoter activity in G0 phase cells, with promoter activity in S phase cells remaining high. However, in promoters regulated by E2F-mediated activation, mutation of the E2F site causes a decrease in transcriptional activity in S phase cells, and G0 phase promoter activity remains low. To determine whether regulation of the E2F1 minimal promoter by CCAAT, YY1, and the GC element was mediated by repression in G0 phase or activation in S phase, the DNAs of the different constructs were carefully quantitated, and then equal amounts of DNA were tested in a serum starvation and stimulation assay. Fig. 3 A demonstrates the lack of growth regulation of the E2F1 minimal promoter in the presence or absence of the E2F sites. For the CCAAT constructs, a promoter having wild type or mutated E2F sites had the same luciferase activity in G0cells. However, luciferase activity in S phase of the promoter having mutated E2F sites was lower than activity of the wild type construct (Fig. 3 B). Therefore, the CCAAT site conferred regulation to the minimal promoter by cooperating with the E2F sites to mediate activation in S phase. Mutation of the E2F sites in the Rep3A GC box-containing promoter construct also lowered S phase activity without increasing G0 phase promoter activity (Fig. 3 C). Therefore, as with the CCAAT site, the GC element regulates the minimal promoter by cooperating with E2F sites to mediate activation in S phase. We note that these results obtained using the synthetic E2F1 promoter constructs are in contrast to studies using the natural E2F1 promoter. Mutation of the E2F sites in the −176/+36 promoter results in a significant increase in transcriptional activity in G0phase, indicating that the −176/+36 construct is regulated by repression. For the YY1 site-containing promoter constructs, mutation of the E2F site resulted in a 3-fold increase in activity in G0 phase and a 2-fold drop in activity in S phase (Fig.3 D). From these data we conclude that the growth regulation of the YY1 construct has two components; YY1 activity is repressed in G0 by E2F protein complexes, and YY1 also cooperates with E2F to mediate activation in S phase. This combination of repression and activation is more similar to the results obtained with the −176/+36 E2F1 construct. Although E2F sites have been identified in many promoters, they have not always been found to mediate G1/S phase regulation. The data presented in this study suggest that a promoter needs specific elements in addition to the E2F site to be regulated. Our results indicate that the addition of a CCAAT site, a YY1 site, or multiple GC boxes can confer E2F-dependent activation of transcription to a simple E2F1 promoter that is not growth-regulated. We began these studies with the knowledge that the −176 to −45 region of the E2F1 promoter contained elements that were required for growth regulation. Although a sequence with homology to a YY1 site is found in the E2F1 promoter, we have not been able to detect YY1 binding to this site. 1P. R. van Ginkel, K.-M. Hsiao, H. Schjerven, and P. J. Farnham, unpublished data. The CCAAT oligonucleotide that was cloned upstream of the E2F1 minimal promoter is based on sequence from the E2F1 promoter, and we have previously shown that nuclear protein binds to this site. Sequence comparison of the Rep3A GC box with the E2F1 promoter identified an element located at −45 to −68 that has 78% identity to the Rep3A GC box, and gel shift analyses demonstrated that protein binds to this site (see below). Thus, two of the three elements that we identified as being able to cooperate with E2F factors are found in the E2F1 promoter. However, both the CCAAT and the GC elements have the potential to bind to a number of cellular proteins. To understand how these elements confer regulation to an E2F-responsive promoter, it is important to determine which proteins are cooperating with E2F. At least four proteins with CCAAT box binding activity have been identified: NF-Y (also called CBF, CP1, or HAP), C/EBP, CTF/NF1, and H1TF2 (20Chodosh L.A. Baldwin A.S. Carthew R.W. Sharp P.A.

However, these proteins all prefer distinct sites, and the CCAAT site at −70 in the E2F1 promoter matches that of NFY. NFY is composed of three subunits, NFYa, NFYb, and NFYc (28Maity S.N. Sinha S. Ruteshouser E.C. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16574-16580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29van Huijsduijnen R.H. Li X.Y. Black D. Matthes H. Benoist C. Mathis D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3119-3127Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). To determine if NF-Y binds to the E2F1 promoter, antibodies raised against NF-Y subunits were incubated with nuclear extracts from Friend and NIH 3T3 cells, and gel mobility retardation reactions were performed using a probe containing the CCAAT site from the E2F1 promoter. A DNA-protein complex was observed, which was supershifted by antibodies against either NF-Ya or NF-Yb, but not by heat-treated antibodies, indicating that these supershifts were due to active antibody-antigen interactions (Fig. 4). In a parallel experiment, similar results were obtained using a probe containing the Y box of the major histocompatibility complex Eα gene, which was previously shown to bind NF-Y (30Dorn A. Bollekens J. Staub A. Benoist C. Mathis D. Cell. 1987; 50: 863-872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). These data indicate that NF-Y is the predominant protein in nuclear extract from mouse cells that binds to the CCAAT box from the E2F1 promoter and suggest that NF-Y may contribute to the growth regulation of the E2F1 promoter. Using a gel mobility retardation assay, we demonstrate that protein binds to a region (−68/−45) of the E2F1 promoter that has homology to the Rep3A GC box. A competitor oligonucleotide containing a consensus Sp1 site from the −77 region of the E2F1 promoter competed for binding, while other binding sites did not (Fig.5 A). Using extracts prepared from Friend cells and antibodies to Sp1 and Sp3, we demonstrate that both Sp1 and Sp3 can bind to the −68/−45 region. We observed that neither the Sp1 nor the Sp3 antibodies alone completely supershifted the binding, but Sp1 and Sp3 antibodies together did completely supershift the band (Fig. 5 B). Similar results were obtained using NIH 3T3 cells (data not shown). These findings are very similar to our data obtained from the Rep3A promoter GC element (31Schilling L.J. Farnham P.J. Cell Growth & Differ. 1995; 6: 541-548PubMed Google Scholar) and suggest that the elements from the Rep3A and the E2F1 promoters may bind the same factors,i.e. members of the Sp1 family of transcription factors. Thus, YY1, NF-Y, and Sp1 family members can all cooperate with E2F factors to mediate growth-regulated transcription. At least two of these factors (NF-Y and Sp1) bind to the mouse E2F1 promoter. Although the binding of these factors to an E2F site-containing promoter region may not guarantee growth regulation, we note that many of the promoters known to be regulated by E2F contain at least one of these elements (1Slansky J.E. Farnham P.J. Farnham P.J. Transcriptional Control of Cell Growth: The E2F Gene Family. 208. Springer-Verlag, New York1996: 1-30Google Scholar). Studies of Blau et al. (32Blau J. Xiao H. McCracken S. O'Hare P. Greenblatt J. Bentley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2044-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) suggest that E2F1 does not require cooperation with additional factors to activate transcription in HeLa or 293 cells. Our data, that robust promoter activity in S phase requires E2F plus an additional transcription factor, are in seeming conflict with these results. One possible explanation for the apparent discrepancy is that the studies of Blau et al. employed a Gal4-E2F1 fusion protein. Therefore, we examined whether Gal4-E2F1 would be sufficient to confer growth-regulated activity or if cooperation between Gal4-E2F1 and other transcription factors would still be essential for high activity in S phase. These experiments required that we bring Gal4-E2F1 to a promoter that cannot be bound by endogenous E2Fs. Therefore, we utilized the E2F1 minimal promoter constructs having one or five Gal4 sites upstream of mutated E2F sites. Gal4-E2F1 and the reporter constructs were transfected into NIH 3T3 cells. Titration of the Gal4-E2F1 expression plasmid was performed and was critical for determining growth regulation, since excess Gal4-E2F1 protein will bind all of the Rb in the cell. This would alter cell cycle regulation of the transfected cell. Analysis of these promoter constructs demonstrates that Gal4-E2F1, but not the Gal4 DNA binding domain alone, can confer growth regulation to the E2F1 minimal promoter in the absence of additional transcription factor binding sites (Fig. 6). In the presence of Gal4-E2F1, the promoters with either one or five Gal4 sites had a 7-fold higher activity in S phase than in G0phase. An important question in the field of E2F-mediated growth regulation is why some, but not all, promoters having E2F sites display differential activity in G0 versus S phase. For example, deoxycytidine kinase has an E2F site in its promoter but does not display cell cycle-dependent regulation (2Hengstschläger M. Mudrak I. Wintersberger E. Wawra E. Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 1389-1394PubMed Google Scholar). Also, we and others have previously shown that deletion of sequences upstream of the E2F sites in the dihydrofolate reductase (18Slansky J.E. Li Y. Kaelin W.G. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13 (; Correction (1993) Mol. Cell. Biol.13, 7201): 1610-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), E2F1 (13Hsiao K.-M. McMahon S.L. Farnham P.J. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1526-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), B-Myb (11Lam E.W.-F. Watson R.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2705-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), and DNA polymerase-α (33Pearson B.E. Nasheuer H.-P. Wang T.S.-F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2081-2095Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) promoters greatly reduces growth-regulated transcriptional activity. We have now used the E2F1 minimal promoter to analyze the promoter context necessary for E2F sites to mediate growth regulation. Since many promoters regulated by E2F sites are complex and contain multiple activator binding sites, our initial hypothesis to explain the lack of regulation of the E2F1 minimal promoter was that strong activators were needed for a high transcriptional activity. In G0 phase, this activity would then be repressed by Rb (or other pocket proteins) bound to E2F. As cells enter S phase, Rb phosphorylation would occur, relieving repression of the promoter. However, VP16, p53, Ets2, and MyoD conferred high transcriptional activity in both G0 and S phase, suggesting that simply bringing in strong activators does not ensure regulation of an E2F site-containing promoter. We did find that three different binding sites could confer regulation to the E2F1 minimal promoter. Further study of the mode of E2F-mediated regulation demonstrated that, instead of being repressed by E2F complexes in G0 phase, NF-Y, YY1, and Sp1 can cooperate with E2F to increase activity in S phase. Many cellular promoters that are regulated by E2F proteins also contain consensus Sp1 and CCAAT binding sites (34Slansky J.E. Farnham P.J. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In several cases, these sites are thought to be important for regulation. Studies of the human thymidine kinase promoter and mouse ribonucleotide reductase R2 promoters suggest that both E2F sites and CCAAT sites are critical for growth regulation (35Pang J.H. Chen K.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2909-2916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Filatov D. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25239-25243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Deletion of a region containing Sp1 sites reduces regulation of the dihydrofolate reductase and thymidine kinase promoters (18Slansky J.E. Li Y. Kaelin W.G. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13 (; Correction (1993) Mol. Cell. Biol.13, 7201): 1610-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 37Karlseder J. Rotheneder H. Wintersberger E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1659-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). We note that the results presented in Fig. 2suggest that consensus Sp1 sites cannot cooperate with E2F sites. While our studies were in progress, other groups found that Sp1 sites can influence E2F-mediated transcriptional regulation but that the exact spacing between the Sp1 sites and E2F site is crucial for this to occur (37Karlseder J. Rotheneder H. Wintersberger E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1659-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 38Lin S.-Y. Black A.R. Kostic D. Pajovic S. Hoover C.N. Azizkhan J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1668-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that the differences observed between the ability of the Rep3A Sp1 site versus the consensus Sp1 site to cooperate with E2F are due to differences in spacing and/or orientation of the two elements. This, of course, also suggests that other factors that did not score positive in our assays could possibly cooperate with E2F if the spacing between the sites were optimized. We propose that transcription factor cooperation explains why some, but not all, promoters that contain E2F sites are growth-regulated (Fig.7). A number of hypotheses have been put forth to explain cooperation between transcription factors. One hypothesis is based on the observation that factors may contact different components of the basal transcription machinery. Blau et al. (32Blau J. Xiao H. McCracken S. O'Hare P. Greenblatt J. Bentley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2044-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) suggest that factors that stimulate initiation versuselongation display cooperation because these two types of factors complement each other's function. However, they found that the E2F1 transactivation domain is sufficient to stimulate both initiation and elongation. Their studies, taken in combination with our results showing that Gal4E2F1 can mediate growth regulation, suggest that the cooperation we see is not a result of a second transactivation domain complementing the function of the E2F1 transactivation domain. However, it is possible that E2F1 is not the E2F family member that is bound to the E2F sites in the E2F1 minimal promoter. Perhaps the transactivation domains of other E2Fs cannot stimulate both initiation and elongation and thus require transcriptional synergy to confer growth regulation (Fig. 7 A). We note that NF-Yb, Sp1, and YY1 all have glutamine-rich regions in their activation domains. Therefore, this type of activation domain could be necessary to cooperate with the E2F to mediate activation. A second type of transcription factor cooperation is based on cooperative binding to DNA. It is possible that the ability of Gal4-E2F1 to confer regulation may be due to a property of its heterologous DNA binding domain. In the absence of certain upstream regulators, the endogenous E2F proteins may not be stably bound to the promoter DNA. Perhaps if E2F can be trapped on the DNA through interaction with upstream regulators, then growth regulation can be achieved (Fig. 7 B). Recent studies (37Karlseder J. Rotheneder H. Wintersberger E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1659-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 38Lin S.-Y. Black A.R. Kostic D. Pajovic S. Hoover C.N. Azizkhan J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1668-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) have shown that Sp1 physically interacts with E2F family members and that binding of Sp1 in vivo to the thymidine kinase promoter can influence the occupancy of a nearby E2F site. Physical interaction between NF-Y or YY1 and E2F family members has not been reported. Experiments are in progress that will allow us to distinguish between these two alternative mechanisms of transcriptional synergy. E2F has been postulated to confer growth regulation via repression (e.g. in the B-Myb promoter; Ref. 11Lam E.W.-F. Watson R.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2705-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) and activation (e.g. in the dihydrofolate reductase promoter; Ref. 39Means A.L. Slansky J.E. McMahon S.L. Knuth M.W.

These studies did not determine if the difference in the mechanism by which E2F regulates these two promoters was due to core promoter elements or subtle differences in E2F sites. We have previously shown that a longer −176/+36 E2F1 promoter construct is regulated by repression, whereas we now show that a minimal E2F1 promoter is regulated by activation. Since the same E2F sites are present in both constructs, we suggest that the distinction is due to the variety of transcription factors present in a given promoter (Fig.8). In complex promoters having many upstream sites, E2F's main role may be to keep transcription low in G0phase. In such promoters, mutation of the E2F site will cause an increase in activity in G0 phase cells (Fig. 8,bottom panel). In contrast, in simple promoters that lack upstream factors, E2F may be required for activation. In these promoters, mutation of the E2F site will not result in high transcriptional activity in G0 due to an essential requirement for the E2F transactivation domain for promoter activity (Fig. 8, top panel). Thus, the main effect will be loss of activation in S phase. In support of this model, Fry et al.(19Fry C.J. Slansky J.E. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1966-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) recently showed that in the relatively simple dihydrofolate reductase promoter, the core promoter elements specify activation by E2F. If the dihydrofolate reductase E2F site is replaced by the B-Myb E2F site in the dihydrofolate reductase promoter, this promoter is still regulated by E2F-mediated activation and not repression. In summary, we have used the E2F1 minimal promoter to further characterize the promoter requirements for E2F-mediated growth regulation. We propose that upstream factors influence E2F-mediated growth regulation in two ways: 1) they are required to confer growth-regulated transcriptional activity; and 2) the number and type of upstream regulators determines whether the main role of E2F is activation or repression.

We have examined cytidine and guanosine transport in this cell line and characterized a novel guanosine-specific transporter. Cytidine transport occurred predominately by equilibrative nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR)-sensitive (es) transport. In the presence of Na+, guanosine at various concentrations accumulated at least 6-fold above equilibrium. The initial rate of guanosine transport in Na+ buffer decreased by 75% with the addition of 1 μm NBMPR and the IC50 for NBMPR inhibition was 0.7 ± 0.1 nm. Replacement of Na+ with choline also resulted in a 75% decrease in total guanosine transport. The potent inhibition of guanosine transport by NBMPR and the loss of transport in choline suggested that a Na+-dependent NBMPR-sensitive transporter was responsible for the majority of guanosine uptake. This concentrative, sensitive transporter is Na+ dependent with a stoichiometric coupling ratio of 1:1. This novel transporter, referred to as csg, is guanosine-specific with total guanosine transport inhibited by only 50% in the presence of 1 mmcompeting nucleosides. HL-60, acute myelocytic leukemia cells, do not exhibit csg activity while L1210, murine acute lymphocytic leukemia cells, exhibit csg transport.

Purine and pyrimidine nucleotides, and their related metabolic products, participate in numerous biological processes. Nucleotides can be synthesized endogenously via de novo synthetic pathways and, as a result, are not considered essential nutrients (1Carver J.D. Walker W.A. Nutr. Biochem. 1995; 6: 58-72Crossref Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 2Voet D. Voet J.G. Sawicki D. Silberberg M. Steifel J. Biochemistry. John Wiley and Sons, New York1990: 740-768Google Scholar). However, a number of tissues including hematopoietic and intestinal epithelial cells are deficient in de novo nucleotide synthetic pathways and rely on the salvage of exogenous nucleosides to maintain nucleotide pools and to meet their metabolic demands (3Fox I.H. Kelly W.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 655-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Nucleoside analogs have important clinical applications in the therapy of neoplastic and viral diseases (4Perigaud C.G. Gosselin G. Imbach J.-L. Nucleosides & Nucleotides. 1992; 11: 903-945Crossref Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Most nucleosides and their analogs execute their biological activity intracellularly, but due to their hydrophilic nature do not readily permeate the lipid bilayer. Therefore, the uptake or release of nucleosides and/or nucleoside analogs in mammalian cells is mediated by multiple distinct transport proteins (5Cass C.E. Georgopapadakou N.H. Drug Transport in Antimicrobial and Anticancer Chemotherapy. Marcel Dekker, New York1995: 403-451Google Scholar, 6Belt J.A. Marina N.M. Phelps D.A. Crawford C.R. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1993; 33: 235-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Currently, seven functionally distinct nucleoside transport (NT) processes have been identified. The classification of NT processes is based on functional and pharmacological characteristics including: transport mechanism, e = equilibrative,c = concentrative; sensitivity to nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR), 1The abbreviations used are: NBMPR, nitrobenzylthioinosine; APL, acute promyelocytic leukemia. 1The abbreviations used are: NBMPR, nitrobenzylthioinosine; APL, acute promyelocytic leukemia. s = sensitive, and i = insensitive; and permeant selectivity.In general, equilibrative processes are widely distributed among mammalian cells and tissues and exhibit broad permeant selectivity (6Belt J.A.

There are two discrete equilibrative transporters, NBMPR-sensitive (es) and -insensitive (ei), that have similar kinetic properties, but differ markedly in sensitivity to NBMPR (10Belt J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1983; 24: 479-484PubMed Google Scholar, 11Plagemann P.G.W. Wohlhueter R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 773: 39-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 12Belt J.A. Noel L.D. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 681-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Both equilibrative transporters are inhibited by low concentrations of dipyridamole and dilazep (9Plagemann P.G.W. Wohlhueter R.M. Woffendin C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 947: 405-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The estransporter is inhibited at low concentrations (≤1 nm) (10Belt J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1983; 24: 479-484PubMed Google Scholar) as a direct result of interaction of NBMPR with high affinity binding sites (K d = 0.1–1 nm) (13Jarvis S.M. Young J.D. Biochem. J. 1980; 190: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 14Cass C.E. Gaudette L.A. Paterson A.R.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 345: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), while the ei transporter is not affected by NBMPR up to > 10 μm (10Belt J.A. Mol.

Phelps D.A. Crawford C.R. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1993; 33: 235-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). These transporters are insensitive to NBMPR and dipyridamole at concentrations up to 10 μm (9Plagemann P.G.W. Wohlhueter R.M. Woffendin C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 947: 405-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 15Vijayalakshmi D. Belt J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19419-19423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is evidence for five subclasses of concentrative transporters that display a complex pattern of overlapping permeant selectivities (5Cass C.E. Georgopapadakou N.H. Drug Transport in Antimicrobial and Anticancer Chemotherapy. Marcel Dekker, New York1995: 403-451Google Scholar). Due to overlapping permeant selectivities, a complex phenotype can result whereby one nucleoside may be simultaneously transported by more than one process within one cell or tissue. The nucleosides are transported against a concentration gradient into the cell, coupled with the movement of Na+down a concentration gradient (16Jarvis S.M. William T.C. Lee C.W. Cheeseman C.I. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1989; 17: 448-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Thus, these processes are described as inwardly directed Na+/nucleoside symporters (17Lee C.W. Cheeseman C.I. Jarvis S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 942: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).There are four major Na+ dependent, concentrative, NBMPR-insensitive (ci) transport systems with varying substrate specificities. cif prefers purines and formycin B is the model substrate (18Crawford C.R. Ng C.Y.C. Noel L.D. Belt J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9732-9736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two distinct systems prefer pyrimidines and are both referred to as cit. These similar processes are distinguished by the ability to transport guanosine (15Vijayalakshmi D. Belt J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19419-19423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Gutierrez M. Giacomini K.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1149: 202-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and thymidine is the model substrate for both systems. The fourthci transporter exhibits broad permeant selectivity and is referred to as cib (6Belt J.A. Marina N.M. Phelps D.A. Crawford C.R. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1993; 33: 235-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 20Wu X. Yuan G. Brett C.M. Hui A.C. Giacomini K.M. J. Biol.

J. 1991; 274: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Both adenosine and uridine are substrates for all four ci transporter types (2Voet D. Voet J.G. Sawicki D. Silberberg M. Steifel J. Biochemistry. John Wiley and Sons, New York1990: 740-768Google Scholar). A preliminary report suggested the presence of a concentrative NBMPR-sensitive (cs) transporter in freshly isolated leukemia cells (22Paterson A.R.P. Gati W.P. Vijayalakshmi D. Cass C.E. Mant J.J. Young J.D. Belch A.R. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1993; 34: 14Google Scholar), however, this transport process remains to be characterized.There are large differences in NT activities from one cell type to another (23Jarvis S.M. Hammond J.R. Paterson A.R.P. Clanachan A.S. Biochem. J. 1982; 208: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Some cell types such as human erythrocytes express only a singe NT system, es (24Woffendin C. Plagemann P.G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 903: 18-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), whereas, both es andei are present in various cell lines, including BeWo human choriocarcinoma cells (25Boumah C.E. Hogue D.L. Cass C.E. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Other cell lines such as L1210 murine leukemia cells and IEC-6 mouse intestinal epithelial cells, express multiple transporters, including equilibrative and concentrative transporters, simultaneously (18Crawford C.R.

J. 1993; 294: 693-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) of HL-60 human leukemia cells leads to a decrease in es nucleoside transport activity and increased Na+-dependent nucleoside transport activity (33Sokoloski J.A. Sartorelli A.C. Handschumacher R.E. Lee C.W. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 515-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 34Goh L.-B. Sokoloski J.A. Sartorelli A.C. Lee C.W. Biochem.

Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 3449-3455PubMed Google Scholar).NB4 cells were originally established from the leukemia cells of a patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) (29Lanotte M. Martin-Thouvenin V. Najman S. Balerini P. Valensi F. Berger R. Blood. 1991; 77: 1080-1086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This cell line expresses the specific t[15;17(q22,q11–12)] chromosomal translocation of APL, thus providing a better model for APL than HL-60 cells which were derived from a patient with acute myelocytic leukemia (3Fox I.H. Kelly W.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 655-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) and lack the characteristic chromosomal translocation. In our laboratory, examination of the NT processes present in NB4 cells has revealed a nucleoside transport phenotype different from that of HL-60 cells (31Roovers K.I. Meckling-Gill K.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 166: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Analysis of adenosine, thymidine, and uridine transport unveiled the presence of both ei and estransporter systems, and most significantly the presence of acif transport system (31Roovers K.I. Meckling-Gill K.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 166: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This observation was the first report of the presence of cif in a human cell line. To further establish the nucleoside transporter phenotype of NB4 cells, this study directly examined the characteristics of both cytidine and guanosine transport in this cell line. Here we describe the complete characterization of an NBMPR-sensitive, Na+-dependent guanosine-specific transporter (csg), the first to be described in eukaryotic cells.DISCUSSIONIn this study, the direct examination of guanosine transport revealed the presence of an NBMPR and dipyridamole-sensitive Na+-dependent, guanosine-specific transporter (csg), the first to be described in eukaryotic cells. Concentrative-sensitive transport (cs) has been previously described in abstract form (22Paterson A.R.P. Gati W.P. Vijayalakshmi D. Cass C.E. Mant J.J. Young J.D. Belch A.R. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1993; 34: 14Google Scholar) in freshly isolated human leukemia cells from chronic lymphocytic and acute myelogenous leukemia patients. The characteristics of the csg transporter identified in NB4 cells are different from those of the cs transporter described in freshly isolated leukemia cells. Only adenosine analogs were permeants for the previously described cs transporter, however, the csg transporter does not accept adenosine directly (31Roovers K.I. Meckling-Gill K.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 166: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and only 50% of guanosine transport via this system is inhibited in the presence of a 10-fold greater concentration of adenosine. It seems likely that with the differences between thiscsg transporter and the previously described csprocess that other cs processes will be discovered.NB4 cells exhibit two high affinity NBMPR-binding sites (31Roovers K.I. Meckling-Gill K.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 166: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Both binding sites had K d values in the nanomolar range, 0.1 and 0.35 nm, consistent with the high affinity systems previously described (9Plagemann P.G.W. Wohlhueter R.M. Woffendin C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 947: 405-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). In this study, the NBMPR inhibition of guanosine transport via the csg transporter was 0.7 ± 0.1 nm, suggesting that one of the two NBMPR-binding sites may be that of the csg transporter.The csg transporter was Na+ dependent, K+ is likely too large, and Li+ too small to emulate Na+ in the csg system. The stoichiometric coupling ratio was determined to be 1:1, analogous to the concentrative insensitive (ci) formycin B selective transporter (cif) and both ci thymidine selective processes (cit) (5Cass C.E. Georgopapadakou N.H. Drug Transport in Antimicrobial and Anticancer Chemotherapy. Marcel Dekker, New York1995: 403-451Google Scholar).To provide insight into the structure of this NT membrane protein, permeant selectivity was assessed. In general, the transporter appeared to be highly guanosine specific. Guanosine transport was inhibited by only 55% in the presence of 1 mm competing nucleosides. Other concentrative systems prefer purines (18Crawford C.R. Ng C.Y.C. Noel L.D. Belt J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9732-9736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), pyrimidines (15Vijayalakshmi D. Belt J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19419-19423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Gutierrez M. Giacomini K.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1149: 202-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), or accept both purines and pyrimidines (2Voet D. Voet J.G. Sawicki D. Silberberg M. Steifel J. Biochemistry. John Wiley and Sons, New York1990: 740-768Google Scholar). As well, other concentrative systems experience greater than 50% inhibition in the presence of competing nucleosides at concentrations equal to (43Williams T.C. Jarvis S.M. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) or as little as 2-fold greater (44Jarvis S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 979: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) than the model nucleoside in question. It appears that the substrate specificity of this novel csgtransporter was dependent on both the presence of an intact ribose ring and the existence of particular functional groups. Ganciclovir, although resembling guanosine in its base structure, has a disrupted ribose ring and is unable to compete with guanosine for the transporter. Although there were no statistically significant differences between 2′-deoxyguanosine, inosine, guanine, hypoxanthine, adenosine, or uridine inhibition, 2′-deoxyguanosine appeared to be the most successful competitor of guanosine transport possibly due to the presence of an intact ribose ring and functional groups almost identical to those of guanosine. Guanine, with identical functional groups to guanosine, but without the ribose ring, appeared to compete with less success than 2′-deoxyguanosine. Studies of the estransporter have shown the transporter to be highly stereoselective strongly preferring the d-enantiomer over the l-enantiomer (45Gati W.P. Dagnino L. Paterson A.R.P. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 957-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) with the ability of a molecule to be transported greatly decreased or elevated by loss or substitution of the 3′hydroxyl residue (46Zimmerman T.P. Mahony W.B. Prus K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5748-5754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, manipulation of molecule structure has the potential to alter transport capacity significantly.We examined two commonly studied leukemia cell lines, HL-60 and L1210 cells: only L1210 cells exhibited concentrative-sensitive transport. From these experiments it appears that concentrative-sensitive guanosine transport is not unique to human leukemia cell lines. HL-60 cells were isolated from a patient with acute myelocytic leukemia rather than APL (NB4) (30Dalton Jr., W.T. Ahearn M.J. McCredie K.B. Freireich E.J. Stass S.A. Trujillo J.M. Blood. 1988; 71: 242-247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several differences between HL-60 cells and NB4 cells have already been reported by this laboratory (31Roovers K.I. Meckling-Gill K.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 166: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 47Bhatia M. Kirkland J.B. Meckling-Gill K.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thecsg transporter appears to be another distinguishing feature of the NB4 cell line.Why do NB4 cells express this guanosine-specific transporter? Guanylate ribonucleotides are involved in a variety of biological roles including, RNA and DNA synthesis, and are required for the function of small GTP-binding proteins (such as Ras) and heterotrimeric G proteins involved in signal transduction (2Voet D. Voet J.G. Sawicki D. Silberberg M. Steifel J. Biochemistry. John Wiley and Sons, New York1990: 740-768Google Scholar, 48Weber G. Adv. Enz. Reg. 1988; 27: 405-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 49Sokoloski J.A. Blair O.C. Sartorelli A.C. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 2314-2319PubMed Google Scholar). dGTP pools appear to be rate-limiting in DNA biosynthesis in rat liver and hepatomas (48Weber G. Adv. Enz. Reg. 1988; 27: 405-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). NB4 cells were observed to transport less guanosine when harvested in plateau phases (data not shown) and therefore it is conceivable that the csg transporter provides a means of ensuring that an adequate supply of dGTP is available to the cell to sustain DNA replication and excessive proliferation. In a hematopoietic cell, such as the NB4 cell, de novo synthesis is limiting and the salvage via membrane transporters is likely to be critical.Nucleoside transport processes appear to be regulated during cellular differentiation (21Lee C.W. Sokoloski J.A. Sartorelli A.C. Handschumacher R.E. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 33Sokoloski J.A. Sartorelli A.C. Handschumacher R.E. Lee C.W. Biochem.

Cell Growth & Differ. 1997; 8: 53-59PubMed Google Scholar), retinoic acid, or tiazofurin (an IMP dehydrogenase inhibitor) show a decrease in intracellular GTP and GDP pools (49Sokoloski J.A.

Blood. 1987; 69: 334-337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Providing guanosine and/or guanine at 1–100 μm (concentrations used in this study) to the medium, prevented the GTP depletion and inhibited myeloid maturation (49Sokoloski J.A. Blair O.C. Sartorelli A.C. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 2314-2319PubMed Google Scholar, 50Wright D.G. Blood. 1987; 69: 334-337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in a dose-dependent manner (53Pilz R.B. Huvar I. Scheele J.S. Van den Berghe Boss G.R. Cell Growth & Differ. 1997; 8: 53-59PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the salvage and/or nucleoside transport capabilities of a cell are important when considering the efficacy of intracellular targeted cytotoxic agents. Differentiation has also been observed in vivo in acute myelocytic leukemia patients receiving tiazofurin (51Tricot G.J. Jayaram H.N. Nichols C.R. Pennington K. Lapis E. Weber G. Hoffman R. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 4988-4991PubMed Google Scholar). There has been some suggestion for the involvement of a G-protein modulated signal transduction pathway in the neutrophilic differentiation of HL-60 cells (33Sokoloski J.A. Sartorelli A.C. Handschumacher R.E. Lee C.W. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 515-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). NB4 cells can be terminally differentiated to granulocytes with retinoic acid (29Lanotte M. Martin-Thouvenin V. Najman S. Balerini P. Valensi F. Berger R. Blood. 1991; 77: 1080-1086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Bhatia M. Kirkland J.B. Meckling-Gill K.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and to monocytes with the combination of 12-O-tetradecanolyphorbol-13-acetate and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (52Bhatia M. Kirkland J.B. Meckling-Gill K.A. Leukemia. 1994; 8: 1744-1749PubMed Google Scholar). It will be enlightening to see if when NB4 cells are differentiated to neutrophils or monocytes, the csg is differentially regulated as a result of differences in the requirement for G-proteins and/or guanine ribonucleotides.Cytidine enters NB4 cells via Na+-independent, presumably equilibrative, routes only, resembling thymidine transport (31Roovers K.I. Meckling-Gill K.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 166: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). At a physiological concentration of 5 μm (7Plagemann P.G.W. Wohlhueter R.M. Curr. Top. Membr. Transp. 1980; 14: 225-330Crossref Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 41Traut T.W. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 140: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar), cytidine accumulated 7-fold above equilibrium suggesting rapid intracellular metabolism of the substrate. When growing cells are exposed to physiological concentrations of nucleosides, the intracellular phosphorylation of the nucleoside often exceeds the nucleoside influx. Thus, the intracellular free nucleoside concentration attains a very slow steady state (7Plagemann P.G.W. Wohlhueter R.M. Curr. Top. Membr. Transp. 1980; 14: 225-330Crossref Scopus (275) Google Scholar). At 50 μm cytidine, very little accumulation of the nucleoside occurred, suggesting that the intracellular phosphorylation reaction was saturated at this concentration.In general, dNTP and NTP levels are higher in actively dividing tumor cells than in untransformed dividing cells (41Traut T.W. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 140: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar). For example, proliferating rat hepatoma 3924A cells in cultured monolayers have a 6.5-fold greater dCTP pool size over normal regenerating rat liver (42Jackson R.C. Lui M.S. Boritzki T.J. Morris I.I.P. Weber G. Cancer Res. 1980; 40: 1286-1291PubMed Google Scholar). The large accumulation of cytidine in the NB4 leukemia cell line may be a reflection of the increased requirement for dCTP and CTP to perform DNA replication thereby allowing for rapid and extensive proliferation.In conclusion, we have identified a new Na+-dependent guanosine-specific nucleoside transporter that may play a role in leukemia development, cell proliferation, and myeloid differentiation. This transporter strongly prefers guanosine over other physiological permeants and may provide a new target for chemotherapy. Purine and pyrimidine nucleotides, and their related metabolic products, participate in numerous biological processes. Nucleotides can be synthesized endogenously via de novo synthetic pathways and, as a result, are not considered essential nutrients (1Carver J.D. Walker W.A. Nutr. Biochem. 1995; 6: 58-72Crossref Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 2Voet D. Voet J.G. Sawicki D. Silberberg M. Steifel J. Biochemistry. John Wiley and Sons, New York1990: 740-768Google Scholar). However, a number of tissues including hematopoietic and intestinal epithelial cells are deficient in de novo nucleotide synthetic pathways and rely on the salvage of exogenous nucleosides to maintain nucleotide pools and to meet their metabolic demands (3Fox I.H. Kelly W.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 655-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Nucleoside analogs have important clinical applications in the therapy of neoplastic and viral diseases (4Perigaud C.G. Gosselin G. Imbach J.-L. Nucleosides & Nucleotides. 1992; 11: 903-945Crossref Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Most nucleosides and their analogs execute their biological activity intracellularly, but due to their hydrophilic nature do not readily permeate the lipid bilayer. Therefore, the uptake or release of nucleosides and/or nucleoside analogs in mammalian cells is mediated by multiple distinct transport proteins (5Cass C.E. Georgopapadakou N.H. Drug Transport in Antimicrobial and Anticancer Chemotherapy. Marcel Dekker, New York1995: 403-451Google Scholar, 6Belt J.A. Marina N.M. Phelps D.A. Crawford C.R. Adv.

The cyclosome is inactive in the interphase of the embryonic cell cycle and is converted to the active form in late mitosis in a phosphorylation-dependent process initiated by protein kinase Cdc2-cyclin B. We show here that the active, phosphorylated form of the cyclosome from clam oocytes binds to p13 suc1, a protein known to associate with Cdc2. The following evidence indicates that the binding of the cyclosome to p13 suc1 is not mediated via the Cdc2-cyclin B complex: (a) activated cyclosome binds to p13 suc1-Sepharose following its separation from Cdc2-cyclin B by gel filtration chromatography; (b) cyclosome from interphase extracts, activated by a kinase in which cyclin B has been replaced by an N-terminally truncated derivative fused to glutathione S-transferase, binds well to p13 suc1-Sepharose but not to glutathione-agarose. An alternative possibility, that the phosphorylated cyclosome binds directly to a phosphate-binding site of p13 suc1, is supported by the observation that the cyclosome is efficiently eluted from p13 suc1-Sepharose by phosphate-containing compounds. This information was utilized to develop a procedure for the affinity purification of the cyclosome. A factor abundant in the fraction not adsorbed to p13 suc1-Sepharose stimulates the activity of purified cyclosome. It is suggested that binding of Suc1 may have a role in the regulation of cyclosome activity.

Recent studies have indicated that a large ∼1,500-kDa complex, referred to as the “cyclosome” (1Sudakin V. Ganoth D. Dahan A. Heller H. Hershko J. Luca F.C. Ruderman J.V. Hershko A. Mol. Biol.

Cell. 1995; 81: 279-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar), plays an important role in the degradation of cyclin B at the end of mitosis. Cyclin B is the activating subunit of protein kinase Cdc2. The activation of Cdc2 is required for cells to undergo mitosis, while the inactivation of Cdc2, caused by the specific and regulated proteolysis of its cyclin B subunit, is essential for exit from mitosis (reviewed in Ref. 3Murray A.W. Cell. 1995; 81: 149-152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Studies in cell-free extracts that reproduce embryonic cell cycles showed that cyclin B is degraded by the ubiquitin pathway (4Glotzer M. Murray A.W. Kirschner M.W.

Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 761-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar). Cyclin ubiquitinylation and degradation depends on a partially conserved 9-amino acid motif, the “destruction box,” which is usually located ∼40–50 amino acid residues from the N terminus of mitotic cyclins (4Glotzer M. Murray A.W. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 1991; 349: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1887) Google Scholar).We have been studying the mechanisms of cyclin degradation by fractionation of a clam oocyte cell-free system (7Hershko A.

Three components were identified to be involved in the ligation of ubiquitin to cyclin B: the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1, a specific ubiquitin-carrier protein E2-C (7Hershko A. Ganoth D.

Ruderman J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4294-4299Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and a cyclin ubiquitin ligase activity associated with particulate material. E1 and E2-C are constitutively active, but the particle-associated ligase activity is cell cycle-regulated; it is inactive in the interphase, but becomes activated at the end of mitosis (7Hershko A. Ganoth D. Sudakin V. Dahan A. Cohen L.H. Luca F.C. Ruderman J.V. Eytan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4940-4946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The particle-associated component was extracted with salt, partially purified, and found to be a ∼1,500-kDa complex, the cyclosome (1Sudakin V. Ganoth D. Dahan A. Heller H. Hershko J. Luca F.C. Ruderman J.V. Hershko A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 185-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). The cyclosome acts on both cyclin A and cyclin B and requires intact destruction box sequences of both cyclins. The activity of the cyclosome is regulated by reversible phosphorylation, as indicated by the findings that the active, mitotic form of the cyclosome can be converted to the inactive form by treatment with an okadaic acid-sensitive phosphatase (9Lahav-Baratz S. Sudakin V. Ruderman J.V. Hershko A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9303-9307Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and that the inactive, interphase form of the cyclosome can be converted to the active form by incubation with protein kinase Cdc2-cyclin B (1Sudakin V. Ganoth D. Dahan A. Heller H. Hershko J. Luca F.C. Ruderman J.V. Hershko A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 185-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 9Lahav-Baratz S. Sudakin V. Ruderman J.V. Hershko A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9303-9307Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Activation of the cyclosome by protein kinase Cdc2-cyclin B includes a time lag (1Sudakin V. Ganoth D. Dahan A. Heller H. Hershko J. Luca F.C. Ruderman J.V. Hershko A. Mol. Biol.

A. 1995; 92: 9303-9307Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), which may serve to prevent the premature inactivation of the kinase in the cell cycle. Based on these findings, we suggested the cyclosome has a regulated cyclin-ubiquitin ligase activity, which targets cyclin B for destruction at the end of mitosis (1Sudakin V. Ganoth D. Dahan A. Heller H. Hershko J. Luca F.C. Ruderman J.V. Hershko A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 185-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar).A similar particle, termed the APC, was identified inXenopus egg extracts by King et al. (2King R.W. Peters J.-M. Tugendreich S. Rolfe M. Hieter P. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1995; 81: 279-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). By the use of antibodies that cross-react with Xenopus proteins, these investigators furthermore identified two subunits of the complex as homologues of the products of budding yeast CDC16 andCDC27 genes, which are required for exit from mitosis and the degradation of mitotic cyclins (10Irniger S. Piatti S. Michaelis K. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1995; 81: 269-277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Other subunits of the cyclosome/APC particle have been identified in a variety of organisms (11Tugendreich S. Tomkiel W. Earnshaw W. Hieter P.

Nature. 1996; 384: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and appear to be strongly conserved in evolution. The cyclosome is also involved in the degradation of anaphase inhibitor proteins, which contain destruction box sequences (17Holloway S.L. Glotzer M. King R.W. Murray A.W. Cell. 1993; 73: 1393-1402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 18Funabiki H. Yamano H. Kumada K. Nagao K. Hunt T. Yanagida M.

Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 3081-3093Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). The subunits of the complex responsible for its specific actions, as well as those responsible for the regulation of its activity, have not yet been identified.To define the mode of action and mechanisms of regulation of the cyclosome, its extensive purification is essential. TheXenopus cyclosome/APC particle was purified by immunoprecipitation (2King R.W. Peters J.-M. Tugendreich S. Rolfe M. Hieter P. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1995; 81: 279-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 15Peters J.-M. King R.W. Hoog C. Kirschner M.W. Science. 1996; 274: 1199-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), but such preparations are not suitable for biochemical studies. In the present report we describe the binding of the cyclosome to p13 suc1 and its use for affinity purification. p13 suc1 was originally identified in the fission yeast by its ability to suppress certain temperature-sensitive mutations of Cdc2 (20Hayles J. Beach D. Durkacz B. Nurse P. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1986; 202: 291-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). A homologous protein in budding yeast, designated Cks, was found to bind strongly to the cyclin-dependent kinase (21Hadwiger J.A. Wittenberg C. Mendenhall M.D. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2034-2041Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The Suc1/Cks family of proteins is essential for viability and is highly conserved in evolution (reviewed in Refs. 22Edincott J.A. Nurse P. Structure. 1995; 3: 321-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar and 23Pines J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1399-1402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), but its exact functions remained unknown. Genetic evidence in yeasts indicates multiple roles in the cell cycle, including entry into mitosis, exit from mitosis, and transition between G1 and S phases of the cell cycle (24Moreno S. Hayles J. Nurse P. Cell. 1989; 58: 361-372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 25Tang Y. Reed S.I. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 822-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Recent biochemical studies with immunodepleted extracts of Xenopus eggs further indicated that Suc1/Cks is required in at least two stages of the embryonic cell cycle: in the activation of the Cdc2-cyclin B complex by tyrosine dephosphorylation of Cdc2, and in exit from mitosis due to cyclin B degradation (26Patra D. Dunphy W.G. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 1503-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of Suc1/Cks proteins (27Parge H.E. Arvai A.S. Murtari D.J. Reed S.I. Tainer J.A.

Cell. 1996; 84: 863-874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) have been solved. In addition to the Cdk binding site they contain a highly conserved phosphate-binding site. It has been suggested (but not yet demonstrated) that the latter site may bind to some phosphorylated proteins, and thus Suc1/Cks may have a role in targeting Cdk-cyclin kinases to certain phosphorylated proteins (26Patra D. Dunphy W.G. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 1503-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar,29Bourne Y. Watson M.H. Hickey M.J. Holmes W. Rocque W. Reed S.I. Tainer J.A.

Our evidence suggests that this binding is due to interaction of the cyclosome with the phosphate-binding site of p13 suc1. This information was utilized to develop an affinity procedure for the purification of the cyclosome.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESUbiquitin from bovine erythrocytes, rcm-BSA, STI, andp-nitrophenylphosphate (pNPP) were obtained from Sigma, and okadaic acid was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim.

Cell. 1995; 6: 185-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar), served as the source for affinity purification.Affinity Purification of CyclosomePrior to affinity purification, the cyclosome was converted to the active form by preincubation with ATP (1Sudakin V. Ganoth D. Dahan A. Heller H. Hershko J. Luca F.C. Ruderman J.V. Hershko A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 185-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 9Lahav-Baratz S. Sudakin V. Ruderman J.V. Hershko A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9303-9307Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) as follows. The incubation mixture contained the following in a volume of 1.2 ml: 50 mmHepes-KOH (pH 7.2), 1 mm DTT, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm ATP, 10 mmphosphocreatine, 100 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase, 12 mg of protein of salt extract of fraction 1 from M phase clam oocytes, and 1 μm okadaic acid. Following incubation at 18 °C for 60 min, the sample was mixed with an equal volume of a solution consisting of 500 mm KCl, 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) and 1 mm DTT and then added to 1.2 ml of p13 suc1-Sepharose beads. The beads had been washed previously three times with 10-ml portions of buffer A (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.25 m KCl, and 1 mm DTT). The sample was mixed with beads at 0 °C for 60 min and then transferred to a column (0.7 cm diameter) at 4 °C. The flow-through fraction was collected, together with a 5-ml wash with buffer A. The column was washed with 30 ml of buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 250 mm KCl, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mmDTT, and 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) and then with 10 ml of buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1 mm DTT, and 20% (v/v) glycerol). The cyclosome was eluted either with 30 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, containing 1 mm DTT and 0.2 mg/ml STI, or with 20 ml of 50 mm pNPP in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1 mm DTT, and 0.2 mg/ml STI. The addition of STI was necessary to prevent the adsorption of the dilute enzyme to surfaces. STI was chosen as the carrier protein, since it has a relatively low molecular mass (20 kDa), and thus it does not interfere with the detection of cyclosome subunits, which are of larger size, in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Elution was at a flow rate of 1–1.5 ml/min. When the pH 9 buffer was used for elution, the eluate was collected to a tube containing Tris-HCl, pH 7.2 (0.1m, final concentration), to decrease the pH. Both eluate and flow-through fractions were concentrated with Centriprep-10 concentrators (Amicon), diluted at least 10-fold with 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.2) containing 1 mm DTT and concentrated again to ∼0.5 ml. Glycerol was added to 20% (v/v), and samples were stored at −70 °C. p13 suc1-Sepharose beads could be regenerated by washing with 30 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), followed by a wash with 30 ml of 1 m KCl. The beads were stored in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) containing 0.02% sodium azide.Preparation of GST-Δ88-cyclin B-Cdc2GST-Δ88-cyclin B-Cdc2 was prepared by the incubation of interphase extracts of clam oocytes (in which cyclin B is absent) with recombinant GST-Δ88-cyclin B and ATP, followed by the purification of the active kinase. The reaction mixture contained the following in a volume of 3.6 ml: 15 mg/ml protein of extract of interphase clam oocytes, 0.2 mg/ml GST-Δ88-cyclin B, and other ingredients similar to those described above for preincubation with ATP and okadaic acid, except that the concentration of MgCl2 was 5 mm. Following incubation at 18 °C for 60 min, the formation of active kinase was verified by an assay of histone H1 kinase activity. It was found that H1 kinase activity rose from very low initial levels (∼0.5 units/μg of protein) to levels comparable with those in mitotic extracts (∼60 units/μg of protein). The kinase was then purified by adsorption to p13 suc1-Sepharose, elution with free p13 suc1, and removal of free p13 suc1 by gel filtration, as described (7Hershko A. Ganoth D. Sudakin V. Dahan A.

Chem. 1994; 269: 4940-4946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Assay of Cyclin-Ubiquitin Ligase ActivityReaction mixtures contained the following in a volume of 10 μl: 40 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mg/ml rcm-BSA, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm phosphocreatine, 50 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase, 50 μm ubiquitin, 1 μm ubiquitin aldehyde, 1 pmol of E1, 5 pmol of E2-C, 1 μm okadaic acid, enzyme source as specified, and 1–2 pmol (∼105 cpm) of 125I-labeled cyclin B-(13–91)/protein A. This N-terminal fragment of cyclin B has been shown to be a suitable substrate for destruction box-specific, cell cycle-regulated ubiquitinylation and degradation of mitotic cyclins (1Sudakin V. Ganoth D. Dahan A. Heller H. Hershko J. Luca F.C. Ruderman J.V. Hershko A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 185-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar,4Glotzer M. Murray A.W. Kirschner M.W.

Following incubation at 18 °C for 1 h, the samples were subjected to electrophoresis on a 12.5% polyacrylamide-SDS gel. Results were quantified with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The amount of radioactivity in all cyclin-ubiquitin conjugates was expressed as the percentage of total radioactivity in each lane (1Sudakin V. Ganoth D. Dahan A. Heller H. Hershko J. Luca F.C. Ruderman J.V. Hershko A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 185-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Reactions were conducted in the range linear with enzyme concentration, which was 5–40% 125I-cyclin ligated to ubiquitin. One unit of ligase activity was defined as that converting 1%125I-cyclin to ubiquitin conjugates under the conditions described above.Miscellaneous AssaysActivity of protein kinase cyclin B-Cdc2 was measured by the phosphorylation of histone H1 following adsorption to p13 suc1-Sepharose. Virtually all such activity in extracts of meiotic M phase clam oocytes is due to cyclin B-Cdc2 complexes (data not shown). Histone H1 kinase assays were conducted as described (35Meijer L. Pondaven P. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 174: 116-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), except that the concentration of ATP was 300 μm, and reactions were conducted at 18 °C. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as that causing the incorporation of 1 pmol of phosphate into histone H1 under these conditions. Protein concentration was determined with the Bio-Rad assay, using bovine serum albumin as standard. To estimate the amount of protein bound to beads, proteins were first eluted from beads by mixing with 4 mguanidine hydrochloride for 1 h at room temperature.DISCUSSIONThis study was initiated by the observation that the active form of the cyclosome binds strongly to p13 suc1-Sepharose beads (Fig. 1). Since the best known property of p13 suc1 and of homologous Cks proteins is their ability to bind Cdks (22Edincott J.A. Nurse P. Structure. 1995; 3: 321-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 23Pines J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1399-1402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 29Bourne Y. Watson M.H. Hickey M.J. Holmes W. Rocque W. Reed S.I. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1996; 84: 863-874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), we have first examined the possibility that cyclosome binding is mediated via Cdc2-cyclin B, which is both a substrate of the enzyme and its activator. We did not find evidence for such an indirect binding, since activated cyclosome bound to p13 suc1-Sepharose following its separation from Cdc2-cyclin B (Fig. 2), and cyclosome from interphase extracts activated by GST-Δ88-cyclin B bound well to p13 suc1-Sepharose, but not to GSH-Sepharose (Table I). An alternative possibility, that the cyclosome is bound directly to the phosphate-binding site of p13 suc1 (27Parge H.E. Arvai A.S. Murtari D.J. Reed S.I. Tainer J.A. Science. 1993; 262: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 28Edincott J.A. Noble M.E. Garman E.F. Brown N. Rasmussen B. Nurse P. Johnson L.N.

Cell. 1996; 84: 863-874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) is suggested by its elution by anions such as phosphate or sulfate and more effectively by the phosphate ester p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Table II). Since activation of the cyclosome is due to its phosphorylation (9Lahav-Baratz S. Sudakin V. Ruderman J.V. Hershko A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9303-9307Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar,15Peters J.-M. King R.W. Hoog C. Kirschner M.W. Science. 1996; 274: 1199-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), the latter suggestion provides a straightforward explanation for the observation that only the active form of the cyclosome binds to p13 suc1-Sepharose. A possible role of the anionic-binding site of Cks proteins in their binding to phosphoproteins has been suggested (26Patra D. Dunphy W.G. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 1503-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 29Bourne Y. Watson M.H. Hickey M.J. Holmes W. Rocque W. Reed S.I. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1996; 84: 863-874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), but we are not aware of any previous instance in which this has been shown to take place. It appears that many other phosphorylated proteins may also bind to p13 suc1-Sepharose, since incubation of M phase extracts with ATP and okadaic acid, which promotes the accumulation of phosphorylated proteins, caused a more than 2-fold increase in the binding of total proteins to p13 suc1-Sepharose beads (data not shown).Although many different (presumably phosphorylated) proteins bind to p13 suc1-Sepharose, considerable purification of the cyclosome is obtained by the present affinity procedure. This is aided by the fact that only a part of the proteins bound to p13 suc1 are eluted at pH 9, along with the cyclosome (Table III). Furthermore, the large size of the cyclosome allows its efficient separation from many other proteins in a subsequent step of gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 4). The final preparation, although not homogenous, appears to be highly purified (Fig. 4 B). It does not contain significant amounts of Cdc2-cyclin B protein kinase activity, and no Cdk was detectable by immunoblotting with anti-PSTAIRE antibody (data not shown). It thus appears that this purification procedure may be valuable for future studies on the mode of action of the cyclosome and its regulation by protein kinase Cdc2-cyclin B.In the course of this study, we have observed that the activity of affinity-purified preparations of the cyclosome is greatly stimulated by a factor abundant in the fraction not adsorbed to p13 suc1-Sepharose. In gel filtration chromatography of this flow-through fraction, stimulatory activity eluted in two peaks, the higher molecular size of which may be an aggregate of the smaller factor (Fig. 3). At present, we do not know the mode of action of this stimulatory factor; its purification and characterization are being pursued in our laboratory. The stimulatory factor is apparently not a"

To study the function of the MAL proteolipid we have ectopically expressed a tagged form of MAL in both mammalian and insect cellular backgrounds. Immunofluorescence analysis in transiently transfected COS-7 cells showed the presence of MAL in large vesicular structures, and biochemical analysis identified MAL in the fraction of membranes resistant to Triton X-100 solubilization. Electron microscopic analysis showed that the expression of MAL in Sf21 cells morphologically resulted in the intracellular accumulation of large vesicles with a diameter from 200 to greater than 700 nm that were absent in uninfected or control infected cultures. Thus, ectopic expression of MAL in this heterologous expression system was sufficient to drive the formation of vesicles with a size similar to that of the vesicles detected in mammalian cells. These vesicles were clearly different from the caveolae-like vesicles induced by caveolin expression, as evidenced by co-infection experiments using a recombinant caveolin baculovirus. Taken together, these results suggest that the MAL proteolipid might play a role as a component of the machinery of vesiculation of glycolipid-enriched membranes.

Taken together, these results suggest that the MAL proteolipid might play a role as a component of the machinery of vesiculation of glycolipid-enriched membranes. Protein recruitment plays a role in a number of cellular processes including adhesion, signal transduction, and protein transport. The confinement of certain proteins into specialized membrane microdomains resistant to nonionic detergent (i.e. Nonidet P-40, Triton X-100) solubilization is emerging as one of the mechanisms used by the cell to recruit specific proteins (1Simons K. Wandinger-Ness A. Cell. 1990; 62: 207-210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 2Lisanti M.P. Scherer P. Tang Z.-L. Sargiacomo M.

The high content in both glycolipids and cholesterol makes these microdomains insoluble in detergent (4Hanada K. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. Pagano R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6254-6260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In epithelial Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) 1The abbreviations used are: MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; mAb, monoclonal antibody; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TGN,trans-Golgi network. 1The abbreviations used are: MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; mAb, monoclonal antibody; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TGN,trans-Golgi network. cells, insoluble membranes have been found at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and the plasma membrane (3Parton R.G. Simons K. Science. 1995; 269: 1398-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 5Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2588) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the membrane microdomains at the TGN are involved in the transport of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins, a limited number of transmembrane proteins, and glycolipids to the apical surface (1Simons K. Wandinger-Ness A. Cell. 1990; 62: 207-210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). According to this model, the self-association of glycolipids and cholesterol would form the biophysical basis for formation of the insoluble microdomains. However, to be operative as a route of transport, the glycolipid-enriched microdomains require protein sorting machinery that would minimally consist of a set of proteins to achieve the processes of vesicle formation, cargo recruiting, targeting, and fusion to the apical surface (1Simons K. Wandinger-Ness A. Cell. 1990; 62: 207-210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The MAL cDNA was initially identified during a search for genes selectively expressed during T cell development (6Alonso M.A. Weissman S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1997-2001Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The MALgene is present in human chromosome 2 (7Alonso M.A. Barton D.E. Francke U. Immunogenetics. 1988; 27: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and is organized into four exons, each of which encodes a hydrophobic segment and an adjacent short hydrophilic sequence (8Rancaño C. Rubio T. Alonso M.A. Genomics. 1994; 21: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The MAL protein displays unusual lipid-like properties that render MAL soluble in the organic solvents commonly used to extract cell lipids (9Rancaño C. Rubio T. Correas I. Alonso M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8159-8164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This feature allowed the assignment of MAL to the proteolipid group, which includes other proteins displaying similar lipid-like characteristics (10Schlesinger M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 193-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). More recently, despite the restricted pattern of MAL gene transcription, MAL expression has also been detected in epithelial MDCK cells (11Zacchetti D. Peranen J. Murata M. Fiedler K. Simons K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 465-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and during the maturation of myelin-forming cells (12Kim T. Fiedler K. Madison D.L. Krueger W.H. Pfeiffer S.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 42: 413-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Thus,MAL gene expression is both tissue- and differentiation-specific and appears to be modulated by elements distal to its 5′-proximal promoter region (13Tugores A. Rubio T. Rancaño C. Alonso M.A. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 245-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In all of the cell types in which is expressed, MAL has been identified as a component of detergent-insoluble membrane microdomains (11Zacchetti D. Peranen J. Murata M. Fiedler K. Simons K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 465-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 12Kim T. Fiedler K. Madison D.L. Krueger W.H. Pfeiffer S.E. J. Neurosci.

J. 1997; 321: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This fact, the identification of MAL in TGN-related vesicles in epithelial cells (14Millán J. Puertollano R. Fan L. Rancaño C. Alonso M.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and its predominance in apical transport vesicles in MDCK cells (11Zacchetti D. Peranen J. Murata M. Fiedler K. Simons K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 465-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) have led to the proposal that MAL is a component of the protein sorting or vesiculation machinery of the glycolipid-mediated pathway of transport (11Zacchetti D. Peranen J. Murata M. Fiedler K. Simons K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 465-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 14Millán J. Puertollano R. Fan L. Rancaño C. Alonso M.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Here, we have approached the study of MAL function using overexpression of MAL in both COS-7 cells and Sf21 insect cells. Transient expression of MAL in COS-7 cells, as in other cell lines (11Zacchetti D. Peranen J. Murata M. Fiedler K. Simons K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 465-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 14Millán J. Puertollano R. Fan L. Rancaño C. Alonso M.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), produces the accumulation of MAL in large vesicles. In this work, we have adopted the baculovirus expression system to study the possible vesiculation induced by MAL expression. Similar to the case in COS-7 cells, the expression of the MAL proteolipid in Sf21 insect cells induced thede novo formation of numerous intracellular vesicles ranging in size from 200 to more than 700 nm that almost completely filled the cytoplasm of the infected cells. These vesicles were clearly different from the caveolae-like vesicles induced by caveolin expression (15Li S. Song K.S. Koh S.S. Kikuchi A. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28647-28654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), as evidenced by co-infection experiments. The interaction of MAL with glycolipid-enriched membranes and its ability to generate extensive vesiculation suggest that MAL might be involved in vesiculation of the glycolipid-enriched microdomains. The mouse hybridoma producing mAb 9E10 (IgG1) against the human c-Myc epitope EQKLISEED (16Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell.

Texas Red-conjugated antibodies were from Southern Biotech. Octyl glucoside and Triton X-100 were from Sigma. The baculovirus expression kit for recombinant baculovirus production was from CLONTECH. COS-7 cells were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies), penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml) in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air. Insect Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf21) cells were provided by Drs. Takashi Okamoto and Ikuo Nishimoto (Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School). Sf21 cells were grown at 27 °C in TC100 medium (Life Technologies) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies), penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml). The human MAL cDNA was tagged at its COOH terminus with sequences encoding the c-Myc epitope and a polyhistidine (His7) tag by the polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the 5′- and 3′-ends of the MAL coding sequence and full-length MAL cDNA (6Alonso M.A. Weissman S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1997-2001Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) as template. In addition, the primer corresponding to the 3′-end contained sequences encoding the 9E10 c-Myc epitope and the polyhistidine tag. For MAL expression in COS-7 cells, the polymerase chain reaction product was subcloned into the pCR3 expression vector (Invitrogen). Transfections were performed by electroporation using the Electro Cell Manipulator 600 instrument (BTX, San Diego, CA) For the generation of recombinant baculovirus, the MAL polymerase chain reaction product was subcloned into the pBacPAK9 transfer plasmid vector. A mixture of 2 μg of recombinant plasmid pBacPAK9-MAL and 1 μg of purified engineered baculoviral vector DNA BacPak6 linearized by Bsu36I digestion were co-transfected into Sf21 cells using Lipofectin-based standard protocols (Life Technologies, Inc.). Four days later, culture supernatants were removed and centrifuged at low speed. Clarified supernatants containing wild-type and recombinant baculoviruses were plaque-assayed on Sf21 cell monolayers. Occlusion-negative plaques were picked up and plated onto 2.5 × 106 cells. After 3 days of incubation, cells were collected and analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-c-Myc mAb 9E10. Viral plaques positive for MAL expression were selected and plated again. After three rounds of plaque purification, the plaque with the highest yield of MAL expression was used as recombinant baculovirus stock for subsequent experiments. The expression of MAL protein in the baculovirus system was evaluated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis. Samples were separated by 15% acrylamide gels under reducing conditions and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). After blocking with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk, 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), blots were incubated with mAb 9E10 culture supernatant at a ratio of 1:2 for 1 h, washed several times, and incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase diluted at 1:5,000 in PBS/Tween 20. Blots were developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting kit (ECL, Amersham). COS-7 cells grown on coverslips were washed with PBS, fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, rinsed, and treated with 10 mm glycine in PBS for 10 min to quench the aldehyde groups. The cells were permeabilized with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 10 min, rinsed, and incubated with 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin for 20 min. Coverslips were then incubated with 9E10 mAb culture supernatant for 1 h, rinsed several times, and incubated for 1 h with goat anti-mouse IgG1 antibodies conjugated to Texas Red used at 1:1,000. After washing, the coverslips were mounted on slides. The cells were photographed with a Zeiss Axioskop photomicroscope using Kodak T-Max 400 film. Samples were fixed with glutaraldehyde, postfixed with osmium tetraoxide, and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, as detailed by Sargiacomo et al. (17Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z.

Cells grown to confluence in 100-mm dishes were rinsed with PBS and lysed with 1.8 ml of 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C. The lysate was scraped from the dishes with a rubber policeman, homogenized by passing the sample through a 22-gauge needle, brought to 40% sucrose (w/w) in a final volume of 4 ml, and finally placed at the bottom of an 8-ml 5–30% linear sucrose gradient. Gradients were centrifuged for 15–18 h at 39,000 rpm at 4 °C in an SW41 rotor (Beckman Instruments). Fractions of 1 ml were collected from the bottom of the tube, and aliquots were subjected to immunoblot analysis. For the estimation of the oligomerization state of recombinant MAL, samples were loaded at the top of a 5–40% linear sucrose gradient (4.3 ml) prepared in 25 mm Mes, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl buffer, and 60 mm octyl glucoside. After centrifugation at 50,000 rpm for 10 h in an SW60 rotor (Beckman Instruments), the gradient was fractionated from the top. Aliquots from the different fractions were subsequently subjected to immunoblot analysis using 9E10 mAb. Molecular mass standards (Sigma) were as follows: carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), α-amylase (200 kDa), and apoferritin (443 kDa). The MAL proteolipid has been found as a component of detergent-insoluble membranes in MDCK cells (11Zacchetti D. Peranen J. Murata M. Fiedler K. Simons K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 465-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), oligodendrocytes (12Kim T. Fiedler K. Madison D.L. Krueger W.H. Pfeiffer S.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 42: 413-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and T lymphocytes (14Millán J. Puertollano R. Fan L. Rancaño C. Alonso M.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Transient expression of the MAL protein in mammalian cells produces the accumulation of the MAL proteolipid in large vesicular structures containing membranes resistant to detergent solubilization (11Zacchetti D. Peranen J. Murata M. Fiedler K. Simons K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 465-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 14Millán J. Puertollano R. Fan L. Rancaño C. Alonso M.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We adopted a baculovirus system to express the MAL protein tagged at its COOH terminus with a c-Myc epitope and a polyhistidine tag in Sf21 insect cells. This expression system was used with the double aim of (i) studying the possible vesiculation induced by MAL expression and (ii) purifying MAL protein for in vitroexperiments. Our current model for MAL structure (8Rancaño C. Rubio T. Alonso M.A. Genomics. 1994; 21: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) as well as a schematic of the tagged protein are shown in Fig. 1. Although previous studies have established that tagging with either c-Myc or polyhistidines does not generally interfere with the normal properties of proteins, we first analyzed the incorporation of the tagged MAL protein into detergent-insoluble membranes by centrifugation to equilibrium and determined its presence in vesicular structures by immunofluorescence analysis. Transiently transfected COS-7 cells were extracted in 1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C, and the extracts were subjected to centrifugation to equilibrium on sucrose density gradients to separate lipid-rich resistant membranes from the Triton X-100-soluble material (5Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2588) Google Scholar). After gradient fractionation, aliquots from the different fractions were subjected to immunoblot analysis using 9E10 mAb. Fig. 2 shows that MAL was confined to the low density “floating” fractions (fractions 5–12), in agreement with the reported presence of MAL in detergent-insoluble membranes (11Zacchetti D. Peranen J. Murata M. Fiedler K. Simons K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 465-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 12Kim T. Fiedler K. Madison D.L. Krueger W.H. Pfeiffer S.E. J. Neurosci.

To analyze the doubly tagged MAL protein, COS-7 cells were observed by immunofluorescence at 24 h post-transfection. Fig.3 shows that MAL overexpression caused the accumulation of the tagged protein along the exocytic pathway and in large vesicles at the cells' periphery.Figure 3Immunofluorescence analysis of COS-7 cells transiently expressing a doubly tagged form of MAL.

Possee R.D. The Baculovirus Expression System: A Laboratory Guide. Chapman and Hall, New York1992Crossref Google Scholar). A band of the corresponding size of the tagged protein was specifically detected in the infected samples when cell extracts from uninfected and infected cells were analyzed by immunoblotting with 9E10 mAb (Fig.4), demonstrating that the protein was efficiently expressed in Sf21 cells using the baculovirus system. Baculovirus-driven expression of caveolin has been successfully used to generate caveolae-like structures in the cytoplasm of Sf21 insect cells (15Li S. Song K.S. Koh S.S. Kikuchi A. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28647-28654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We have used this system to address whether expression of MAL can induce vesicles as well. Electron microscopic analysis of uninfected cells (Fig. 5 A) or cells infected with a baculovirus expressing control proteins (not shown) did not show any remarkable difference in their cytoplasmic vesicle content. However, MAL expression induced a massive de novo production of large vesicles in the cytoplasm of the infected cultures (Fig. 5,B–E). More than 100 vesicles were counted, and their sizes were determined. Fig. 5 F shows that the range of vesicle size was from 200 to more than 700 nm in diameter. Quantitative analysis indicated that the major group (36% of the total number of vesicles examined) includes vesicles with a diameter of ∼300–400 nm, whereas 80% of the vesicles have a diameter of ∼200–600 nm. MAL and caveolin are two protein candidates to be elements of the vesicular machinery for protein sorting, operating in the glycolipid-mediated route of transport (11Zacchetti D. Peranen J. Murata M. Fiedler K. Simons K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 465-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar,20Kurzchalia T.V. Dupree P. Parton R.G. Kellner R. Virta H. Lehnert M. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1003-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). In addition, caveolin appears to function in the organization of caveolar architecture (15Li S. Song K.S. Koh S.S. Kikuchi A. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28647-28654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 21Rothberg K.G. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y.-S. Glenney J.R.

A. 1995; 92: 8655-8659Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Whereas caveolin expression in Sf21 cells induced the formation of vesicular structures with a diameter of 50–100 nm resembling intracellular caveolae (15Li S. Song K.S. Koh S.S. Kikuchi A. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28647-28654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), we have shown here that MAL expression induces much larger vesicles. To investigate whether there is any effect on the morphology of their respective vesicles under condition of simultaneous expression, we examined the cytoplasm of cells co-infected with recombinant viruses expressing MAL, caveolin-1α, and caveolin-1β. Fig. 6 shows the simultaneous presence in these cells of two different populations of vesicles: large ones with a size corresponding to those induced by MAL and small ones corresponding to the intracellular caveolae-like vesicles induced by caveolin (15Li S. Song K.S. Koh S.S. Kikuchi A. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28647-28654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This suggests that the vesiculation induced by MAL and caveolin are two separate processes. Caveolin is known to form large homo-oligomers in both mammalian (24Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E. Tang Z.-L. Kubler E. Song K.S. Sanders M.C. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9407-9411Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 25Monier S. Parton R.G. Vogel F. Behlke J. Henske A. Kurzchalia T.V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 911-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) and insect cells (15Li S. Song K.S. Koh S.S. Kikuchi A. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28647-28654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To address whether MAL is also able to form homo-oligomers, we assessed the oligomeric state of recombinant MAL in insect cells by employing an established velocity gradient system (24Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E. Tang Z.-L. Kubler E. Song K.S. Sanders M.C. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9407-9411Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Fig. 7 indicates that, in contrast to caveolin, MAL does not form large oligomers, although dimers, trimers, and even tetramers were detectable. Similar results were obtained in stably transfected epithelial cells (not shown). This indicates that the generation of vesicles induced by MAL expression does not require the formation of large MAL homo-oligomers. The identification of the components of the protein machinery involved in vesicle budding, transport, and fusion is a major focus in modern cell biology (26Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1993) Google Scholar, 27Rothman J.E. Wieland F.T. Science. 1996; 272: 223-227Crossref Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). Especially challenging is the study of the mechanisms of vectorial transport in epithelial cells in which apical and basolateral plasma membrane proteins are sorted at the TGN by inclusion into separate vesicular carriers (28Rodriguez-Boulan E. Powell S.K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 395-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 29Matter K. Mellman I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that one of the routes to the apical membrane in epithelial MDCK cells is mediated by glycolipid-enriched membrane clusters (1Simons K. Wandinger-Ness A. Cell. 1990; 62: 207-210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). One approach to dissect the protein machinery implicated in the glycolipid-mediated pathway of transport in MDCK cells has been the immunoisolation of the transport vesicles (30Wandinger-Ness A. Bennett M.K. Antony C. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 987-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Characterization of the proteins present in the detergent-resistant membrane fraction from apical vesicles has revealed the identity of four of these proteins: caveolin (VIP21) (20Kurzchalia T.V. Dupree P. Parton R.G. Kellner R. Virta H. Lehnert M. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1003-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar), VIP36 (31Fiedler K. Parton R.G. Kellner R. Etzold T. Simons K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1729-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), annexin XIIIb (32Fiedler K. Lafont F. Parton R.G. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1043-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and MAL (VIP17) (11Zacchetti D. Peranen J. Murata M. Fiedler K. Simons K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 465-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that these four proteins might play a role as components of the vesicular transport machinery. Immunofluorescence analysis of transiently transfected epithelial (14Millán J. Puertollano R. Fan L. Rancaño C. Alonso M.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) or COS-7 cells (this report) showed MAL in large ring-like structures at the times of massive overexpression of the protein, whereas a punctate pattern consisting of small vesicular structures is observed at earlier times. The use of the recombinant baculovirus expression system allows a massive overexpression in every cell in the culture, making it possible to observe a great magnification of the effects produced by the protein; these effects are sometimes difficult to detect with lower levels of protein expression. A second advantage of this system is that it allows the analysis of the effects of ectopic protein expression in a nonmammalian protein background. To study the possible formation of vesicles induced by MAL expression, we developed an experimental system in which the human MAL proteolipid has been overproduced in Sf21 cells by using a baculovirus-based vector. Similar to the results of transient expression experiments in mammalian cells, MAL overexpression in the infected insect cells resulted in a large number of intracellular vesicles ranging in size from 200 to more than 700 nm in diameter. These vesicles were absent in infections with control baculoviruses as evidenced by electron microscopy analysis. Caveolin is preferentially located in mammalian cells in specialized invaginations of the plasma membrane called caveolae (21Rothberg K.G. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y.-S. Glenney J.R. Anderson R.G.W. Cell. 1992; 68: 673-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1842) Google Scholar) and consistently induces the formation of caveolae-like vesicles in insect cells (15Li S. Song K.S. Koh S.S. Kikuchi A. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28647-28654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). MAL, which is mainly located in TGN-derived vesicular structures (14Millán J. Puertollano R. Fan L. Rancaño C. Alonso M.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), produces large vesicles in insect cells clearly different from those induced by caveolin as shown in co-infection experiments. It is plausible that both caveolin and MAL may belong to the vesicular transport machinery specific for the glycolipid-enriched microdomains but acting in the generation of different classes of vesicular carriers. Thus, is possible that more that one glycolipid-mediated route of transport can take place in the cell. For instance, caveolin-induced vesicles appear related to specific transport to caveolae, whereas MAL-induced vesicles might be involved in transport to the apical surface. The induction of two different types of vesicles by the simultaneous ectopic expression of MAL and caveolin in insect cells is in agreement with our recent results showing segregation of MAL and caveolin into distinct lipid microenvironments in MDCK cells (33Millán J. Puertollano R. Fan L. Alonso M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 707-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Caveolin expression in insect cells induces intracellular caveolae-like vesicles but not surface caveolae (15Li S. Song K.S. Koh S.S. Kikuchi A. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28647-28654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). One interpretation of these findings is that these vesicles probably represent transient intermediates on the way toward fusion with the plasma membrane to form plasma membrane-attached caveolae. Thus, other factors absent in Sf21 cells may exist to connect these putative precursors to the plasma membrane. Similarly, MAL-induced vesicles in Sf21 cells were also intracellular, and we did not detect any fusion event between the vesicles and the plasma membrane. This suggests that the machinery for fusion of MAL-induced vesicles with the plasma membrane is not also operative in Sf21 cells. However, the heterogeneous size of the vesicles induced by MAL expression suggests that homotypic fusion events might occur, generating larger vesicles. It has been shown that caveolin is found in mammalian cells as large homo-oligomers of up to ∼400 kDa (24Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E. Tang Z.-L. Kubler E. Song K.S. Sanders M.C. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9407-9411Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 25Monier S. Parton R.G. Vogel F. Behlke J. Henske A. Kurzchalia T.V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 911-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). These oligomerization properties were preserved in insect cells expressing recombinant caveolin (15Li S. Song K.S. Koh S.S. Kikuchi A. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28647-28654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). On the contrary, the analysis of the oligomeric state showed that MAL does not form large oligomers but that it can be found as dimers, trimers, and even tetramers in both mammalian and insect cells. The interaction of MAL with itself and with selected endogenous lipid components might provide the basis for membrane vesiculation. In summary, based on the specific presence of MAL in transport vesicles containing detergent-insoluble membranes (11Zacchetti D. Peranen J. Murata M. Fiedler K. Simons K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 465-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 14Millán J. Puertollano R. Fan L. Rancaño C. Alonso M.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), MAL has been proposed to play a role as a component of the transport machinery of the glycolipid-mediated pathway. The results presented in this work showing the induction of extensive vesicle formation by MAL expression in insect cells are consistent with a role for MAL in vesiculation of glycolipid-enriched microdomains.

The α and β subunits contain catalytic sites for cGMP hydrolysis, whereas the γ subunits serve as a protein inhibitor of the enzyme. Visual excitation of photoreceptors enables the activated GTP-bound form of the G-protein transducin to remove the inhibitory action of the γ subunit, thereby triggering PDE-6 activation. The type 5 phosphodiesterase (PDE-5) isoform shares a number of similar characteristics with PDE-6, including binding of cGMP to noncatalytic sites, the cyclic nucleotide specificity, and inhibitor sensitivities.

Here we report that both the recombinant γ subunit and a peptide corresponding to amino acids 24–46 in this protein inhibited the activation of PDE-5 by PKA. Furthermore, immunoblotting airway smooth muscle membranes with a specific antibody against amino acids 24–46 of the PDE-6 γ subunit identified two major immunoreactive small molecular mass proteins of 14 and 18 kDa (p14 and p18). These appear to form a complex with PDE-5, because PDE activity was immunoprecipitated using antibody against the PDE-6 γ subunit. p14 and p18 were also substrates for phosphorylation by a unidentified kinase that was stimulated by a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein. Phosphorylation of p14/p18 in membranes treated with guanine nucleotides correlated with a concurrent reduction in the activation of PDE-5 by PKA. We suggest that p14 and p18 share an epitope common to PDE-6 γ and that this region may interact with PDE-5 to prevent its activation by PKA.

The integration of these diverse cell signals enables the precise co-ordinated regulation of intracellular cyclic nucleotide levels in response to receptor stimulation. PDE-5 from smooth muscle and PDE-6 from photoreceptors share a number of common properties. They have two tightly bound subunits containing both catalytic and noncatalytic cGMP binding sites, hydrolyze cGMP better than cAMP, and are both inhibited by zaprinast. The noncatalytic cGMP-binding site in PDE-5 is formed from an N-terminal tandem repeat that is indicative of gene duplication, whereas the catalytic site is located in the C-terminal region of the protein and is conserved in a number of PDE isoforms (1Beavo J.A. Conti M.C. Heaslip R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 399-405PubMed Google Scholar, 10McAllister-Lucas L.M. Sonnenburg W.K. Kadlecek A. Seger D. Trong H.L. Colbran J.L. Thomas M.K. Walsh K.A.

PDE-6 is expressed in photoreceptor rod cells, where it serves as an effector in the visual transduction signal cascade (11Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10711-10714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Hurly J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 13Chabre M. Deterre P. Eur. J.

This involves the photoexcitation of rhodopsin, the GDP-GTP cyclical activation of the G-protein, transducin, and the subsequent stimulation of PDE-6 activity by the GTP-bound transducin. PDE-6 is a heterotetrameric protein composed of catalytic α and β subunits and two inhibitory γ subunits. The GTP-bound transducin binds to the γ subunits and displaces them, thereby activating PDE-6. PDE-6γ has two additional functions: first, it increases the affinity for cGMP in the PDE-6 noncatalytic site (14Yamazaki A. Batucca P. Ting A. Bitensky M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1982; 79: 3702-3706Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 15Cote R.H. Bownds M.D. Arshavsky V.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4845-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and second, it participates in the activation of transducin GTPase, thereby terminating the activation of PDE activity by the GTP-bound α subunit of transducin (16Arshavsky V.Y. Bownds M.D. Nature. 1992; 357: 416-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Desensitization of PDE-6 activity might also occur via a recently proposed kinase-directed phosphorylation mechanism (17Tsuboi S. Matsumoto H. Jackson K.W. Tsujimoto K. Williams T. Yamazaki A. J.

The phosphorylated γ subunits appear to render PDE-6 refractory to stimulation by transducin. PDE-5 is the major cGMP-binding protein in lung (19Francis S. Corbin J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 722-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It is a homodimer comprised of two identical catalytic subunits, each with the molecular mass of 93 kDa. PDE-5 contains a site (Ser92) that is phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase G (5Thomas M.K. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14971-14978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation of the PDE-5 is kinetically enhanced by the binding of cGMP to the noncatalytic cGMP-binding site. However, no change in enzyme activity has been observed as a consequence of the phosphorylation of purified bovine PDE-5 (5Thomas M.K. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14971-14978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To the contrary, we have demonstrated that the catalytic subunit of PKA can catalyze up to a 10-fold increase in the V max of a partially purified preparation of guinea pig lung PDE-5 (20Burns F. Rodger I.W. Pyne N.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 21Burns F. Pyne N.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 1389-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Activation of PDE-5 by phosphorylation may therefore enhance the rate of cGMP signal termination in intact cells, and this proposal is supported by the observation that cGMP elevating agents elicit rapid transient phosphorylation and activation of PDE-5 in vascular smooth muscle cells (22Wyatt T.M. Francis S.H. McAllister-Lucas L.M. Corbin J.D. FASEB. J. 1994; 8 (abstr.): 372Google Scholar). Multiple similarities in the structure and function of PDE-5 and PDE-6 point to the possibility that PDE-5 might contain its own γ subunits that couple this enzyme to unidentified G-protein-dependent pathway. Here we have characterized the interaction of PDE-5 with recombinant PDE-6γ and have identified two small molecular mass proteins in airway smooth muscle cell membranes that appear to share an epitope common to PDE-6γ. This epitope region interacts with PDE-5 to prevent its activation by PKA. All biochemicals were from Boehringer Mannheim, whereas general chemicals were from Sigma. [γ-32P]ATP, [3H]cGMP, and excitation chemiluminescence detection kits were from Amersham International (Bucks, UK). Ophiophagus Hannah snake venom was from Sigma. Reporter horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit antibody was from the Scottish Antibody Production Unit (Carluke, Scotland). Purified brain protein kinase C containing multiple isoforms was purchased from Calbiochem. The preparation of the primary cultures of guinea pig airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells was achieved as described previously (23Pyne S. Pyne N.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 45: 593-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and 10% (v/v) donor horse serum and were passaged twice using trypsin prior to experimentation. Cells were grown to confluence and routinely used at 15–21 days after the initial preparation. Their identity was confirmed to be smooth muscle by the presence of α-actin, using a smooth muscle-specific mouse anti-α-actin monoclonal antibody (23Pyne S. Pyne N.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 45: 593-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cells were placed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% (v/v) fetal calf serum and 1% (v/v) donor horse serum for 24 h. In some cases, cells were incubated with pertussis toxin (0.1 μg/ml) for 24 h. All fractionation procedures were performed at 4 °C. The medium was removed from the cells and buffer A containing 0.25 msucrose, 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mmbenzamidine was added. Cells were scraped off the plate and passed twice through a 0.25-mm gauge syringe. Cell membranes were collected by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min and resuspended in buffer A. Lung tissue was homogenized in buffer A, using a Turrex homogenizer, and the subsequently obtained homogenate was filtered through cheese cloth and centrifuged at 10,000 × g in a Beckman prep 65 centrifuge for 10 min. The supernatant was removed and recentrifuged at 48,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. The subsequently obtained membrane pellet was resuspended in buffer A. Partial purification of guinea pig lung PDE-5 from a “high speed” supernatant fraction was achieved as described previously by us (20Burns F. Rodger I.W. Pyne N.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Briefly this involved homogenizing guinea pig lung in phosphate buffer containing 20 mmK2HPO4/K2HPO4, pH 6.8, at 4 °C. The homogenate was passed through cheese cloth and centrifuged identically to that described for the preparation of membranes. The high speed (48,000 × g) supernatant was taken for the partial purification of the PDE-5. This was achieved using three chromatographic columns; namely (i) DEAE-Sepharose 6B (PDE was eluted with 0.25 m NaCl in phosphate buffer, pH 6.8); (ii) Affi-gel blue agarose (PDE was eluted with 0.35 mpotassium thiocyanate in phosphate buffer, pH 6.8); and (iii) zinc chelate adsorbent matrix (PDE activity passes straight through the column). This yields a preparation of enzyme that is approximately 10–20% pure, based upon maximal isobutylmethylxanthine-stimulated [3H]cGMP binding to the noncatalytic site of PDE-5. We have previously demonstrated that this enzyme preparation contained a single class of cGMP hydrolytic sites, was potently inhibited by zaprinast (IC50 = 0.68 μm using 0.5 μm cGMP), and could be maximally activated up to 10-fold by the catalytic subunit of PKA (20Burns F. Rodger I.W. Pyne N.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Recombinant wild type PDE-6γ was purified by a combination of cation exchange and reverse-phase chromatography (24Brown R.L. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4922-4926Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) fromEscherichia coli strain BL21 DE3 transformed with an expression plasmid containing PDEγ synthetic gene. The coding sequence for PDEγ from the fusion protein (24Brown R.L. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4922-4926Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) was subcloned into an expression vector pET-11a (Novagen) by Dr. J. Sondek (Yale University). The purity of PDE6γ was estimated to be >95%, and the PDE6γ concentration was determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 7100. The assay of PDE activity was by the two-step radiotracer method (25Thompson W.J. Appleman M.M. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Assays were performed at 0.5 μm[3H]cGMP. All PDE activity measurements were done under conditions of linear rate product formation and where less than 10% of the substrate was utilized during the assay. Partially purified guinea pig PDE-5 and membranes were separately incubated with an “activation mixture” containing final concentrations of 25 μm ATP, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, and the catalytic subunit of PKA (10 units). Incubations were performed at 37 °C for 20 min. Samples were then withdrawn for PDE assay. In experiments where the effect of either PDE-6γ or a peptide corresponding to amino acids 24–46 of PDE-6γ was investigated, we combined each with the PDE prior to the addition of the activation mixture and kinase. In studies investigating the phosphorylation of PDE-6γ peptide (amino acids 24–46), we combined the peptide with the activation mixture and the catalytic subunit of PKA (10 units). In studies using purified protein kinase C (PKC), we added 0.75 mm CaCl2, 50 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, and 0.05 units of PKC to the activation mixture. Each reaction was initiated by adding 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Incubations were performed at 37 °C for 60 min and terminated by the addition of 75 mmorthophosphoric acid. Samples were spotted onto P81 cellulose discs and washed in 3 × 250 ml acetic acid (1%, v/v) washes. The amount of32P-labeled peptide was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. In experiments where ASM membranes were utilized to assess p14 and p18 phosphorylation, the catalytic subunit of PKA was omitted, and the activation mixture was supplemented with [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi/assay). Incubations were performed at 37 °C for 20 min. At the termination of the incubation, membranes were then harvested by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and taken for immunoprecipitation with anti-PDE-6γ antibody. In some experiments, ASM membranes were incubated with varying concentrations of GppNHp (1–100 μm) and ATP (0.005–50 μm) in 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, and 5 mm MgCl2. This was performed at 37 °C for 10 min. GppNHp was prepared in 60 mm NaCl, 5 mmHepes, pH 7.4, and 5 mm MgCl2. At the termination of the incubation, membranes were then harvested by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and taken either for immunoblotting with anti-PDE-6γ or for activation with PKA. ASM membranes were solubilized in 10 mmK2HPO4/K2HPO4 and 0.15m NaCl, pH 6.8 (PBS) containing 1% (w/v) deoxycholate and 0.1% (w/v) SDS for 60 min at 4 °C. The material was harvested and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and 250 μl of supernatant was taken and immunoprecipitated with the anti-PDE-6γ antibody. After agitation for 1–2 h at 4 °C, 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose was added for 30 min at 4 °C. The subsequently obtained protein A-Sepharose immune complex was collected by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, washed three times in PBS, and then taken either for PDE assay or for analysis of [32P]phosphate incorporation into p14 and p18. Nitrocellulose sheets were blocked in 5% gelatin in PBS at 37 °C for 1 h and then probed with anti-PDE-6γ antibody in PBS containing 1% gelatin (w/v) plus 0.05% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 at 37 °C for 12 h. After this time, the nitrocellulose sheets were washed in PBS plus 0.05% (v/v) Nonidet P-40. Detection of immunoreactivity was achieved by incubating nitrocellulose sheets for 2 h at 37 °C with a reporter horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit antibody in PBS containing 1% gelatin (w/v) plus 0.05% (v/v) Nonidet P-40. After washing the blots as described above to remove excess reporter antibody, immunoreactive bands were detected using an excitation chemiluminescence detection kit. To explore the hypothesis that PDE-5 can be regulated by small proteins homologous to PDE-6γ, we have tested the ability of recombinant PDE-6γ to modulate the activity of the partially purified PDE-5. As shown in Fig.1 A, the incubation of PDE-6γ with PDE-5 at 4 °C for 30 min prevented the subsequent activation of PDE-5 by PKA. A doubling in kinase activity does not reduce the inhibitory effect of PDE-6γ, suggesting that the kinase does not compete with PDE-6γ for PDE-5. It is well documented that PDE-6γ interacts with PDE-6 via a central polycationic region whose role is to increase the affinity between PDE-6γ and PDE-6 catalytic subunits (26Brown R.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5918-5925Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 27Artemyev N.O. Hamm H.E. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 28Natochin M. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19964-19969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To establish whether this region of PDE-6γ is responsible for preventing PDE-5 activation by PKA, we studied the effect of a peptide, whose sequence corresponded to amino acids 24–46 in PDE-6γ on the activation of PDE-5 by PKA. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the incubation of PDE-5 with micromolar quantities of the polycationic peptide at 4 °C for 30 min prevented the subsequent activation of PDE-5 by PKA. The effect of PDE-6γ was also concentration-dependent (Fig. 1 B), with an approximately 80% inhibition of the PKA-dependent activation of PDE-5 being evident at 0.3 μm PDE-6γ. The addition of PDE-6γ to the activated PDE-5 was without effect (Fig. 1 C), suggesting that PDE-6γ elicits its effect by preventing the activation process. It was also necessary to show whether PDE-6γ is required to be phosphorylated to inhibit PDE-5. This concern was raised after we found that PDE-6γ can in fact serve as a substrate for PKA (see Fig. 8). A definitive answer came from experiments with the peptide. The peptide does not contain putative sites for the phosphorylation by PKA and indeed was not phosphorylated by this kinase (Fig. 2). The peptide does contain a phosphorylation site for PKC at Thr35 (29Udovichenko I.P. Cunnick J. Gonzales K. Takemoto D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9850-9856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is vigorously phosphorylated by this kinase (Fig. 2). We conclude from these studies that the phosphorylation of PDE-6γ subunit by PKA has no influence upon its interaction with PDE-5.Figure 2Peptide corresponding to the sequence 24–46 in PDE-6γ was phosphorylated by PKC but not by PKA. Purified PDE-6γ peptide (final concentration, 600 μm) was subjected to phosphorylation by PKC and PKA according to “Experimental Procedures.” 32P incorporation into peptide is expressed as means ± S.D. for assays in triplicate from a representative experiment performed three times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Finally we needed to show that the effect of PDE-6γ and the polycationic peptide on the regulation of PDE-5 by PKA was not due to inhibition of the kinase. This was established by demonstrating that neither PDE-6γ nor the polycationic peptide inhibited the PKA-catalyzed phosphorylation of an exogenous substrate, myelin basic protein (Fig. 3). We next attempted to establish whether ASM cell membranes express proteins that contain a similar peptide region to that found in PDE-6γ (amino acids 24–46), because these may serve as inhibitors of PDE-5. Immunoblotting cultured airway smooth muscle membranes with rabbit antibodies raised against amino acids 24–46 of bovine PDE-6γ identified two immunoreactive staining polypeptides in the low molecular mass range (Fig.4 A). These polypeptides each have anM r of 14 and 18 kDa (termed here p14 and p18) and migrated close to recombinant PDE-6γ (see Figs. 8 and 10).Figure 10The effect of combined GppNHp and ATP upon the immunoreactivity of p14 and p18 in washed isolated ASM cell membranes. The immunoblot shows the effect of separate and combined treatments of membranes with GppNHp (100 μm) and ATP (5–500 nm) on the immunoreactivity of p14 and p18. Membranes were pretreated with GppNHp and ATP as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Recombinant PDE6γ (γR) was also electrophoresed along side the ASM samples. These are representative results from three different membrane preparations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also show that the detection of p14 and p18 was reduced when the immunizing peptide was combined with antibody (Fig. 4 B). p14 and p18 appear to form a stable complex with PDE-5 in membranes. This was indicated from experiments in which the anti-PDE-6γ antibody immunoprecipitated PDE activity from detergent solubilized membranes (Fig. 4 C). The finding that a peptide corresponding to amino acids 24–46 of PDE-6γ can modulate the activation of PDE-5 and that an antibody raised to this region identified two low molecular mass proteins suggests that these proteins may function like PDE-6γ. It also indicates that a G-protein-dependent mechanism similar to that regulating PDE-6γ may be present in ASM cell membranes. To test this hypothesis we needed to show that PDE-5 could be activated by PKA in isolated membranes and that this could be modified by p14 and p18 in a G-protein-dependent manner. In this regard, Fig.5 shows that PDE-5 in guinea pig lung and ASM membranes was markedly activated by PKA in the presence of ATP. To assess the role of G-proteins, we have tested the effect of GppNHp (a nonhydrolyzable analogue of GTP) on the activation of PDE-5 by PKA. The addition of GppNHp (1–100 μm) to membranes prevented activation in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.6). The inhibition was not due to direct activation of PKA or binding of this guanine nucleotide to the PDE, because GppNHp was without effect on the activation of partially purified PDE-5 by PKA (data not shown). Further, GppNHp did not modulate membrane PDE-5 activity in the absence of PKA (data not shown).Figure 6GppNHp inhibits PKA-activated PDE-5 activity in isolated ASM cell membranes. Membranes were pretreated with GppNHp and taken for incubation with PKA. The graph shows the concentration-dependent inhibition of PKA-stimulated PDE-5 activity by GppNHp (1–100 μm) in isolated ASM cell membranes. The results are expressed as the means ± S.D. for three different membrane preparations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We show in Fig.7 A that pertussis toxin treatment of ASM cells, which was used to inactivate Gi and Go, reversed the inhibition induced by GppNHp on the PKA-dependent activation of PDE-5. When samples are prepared from membranes treated with GppNHp, a reduction in the immunoreactivity of p14 and p18 was also detected on immunoblots (Fig.7 B). This reduction was prevented in cells pretreated with pertussis toxin (Fig. 7 B) and therefore correlated with the reversal of the inhibitory effect of GppNHp on the PKA-dependent activation of PDE-5. The corresponding appearance of p14 and p18 in the supernatant of GppNHp-treated membranes was not detected, indicating that the reduced immunoreactivity of p14 and p18 was not due to their displacement from the membrane but rather a consequence of a post-translational modification. This may involve phosphorylation of the antibody recognition epitope supported by endogenous ATP. Alternatively, GppNHp may activate a protease that cleaves p14/p18 to remove the epitope. However, phosphorylation in this region is consistent with the following observations. In Fig. 8 we show that p14 and p18 were phosphorylated by an endogenous kinase when radiolabeled ATP is added, and this could be increased by the addition of GppNHp to membranes. In Fig. 9 we show that the addition of ATP (0.5–50 μm) to membranes also induced a reduction in the immunoreactivity of p14 and p18. However, when membranes were washed with buffer A to remove endogenous nucleotides, GppNHp and ATP were only effective when added together (Fig. 10). In Fig. 11, we show that the addition of PDE inhibitors (isobutylmethylxanthine and theophylline, 100 μm) at a concentration that is known to completely inhibit PDE-5 activity negated the effect of GppNHp on the phosphorylation and immunoreactivity of p14 and p18. These observations indicate that PDE-5, p14 and p18, unidentified G-protein, and kinase may be linked in a signal transduction cascade, because their ligand bindings appear to modulate their interactions. The major observations of this study are: (i) recombinant PDE-6γ and a peptide corresponding to amino acids 24–46 of PDE-6γ prevent the PKA-dependent activation of PDE-5 and (ii) airway smooth muscle cells express two small molecular mass proteins (p14 and p18) that are immunologically related to the inhibitory γ subunit of the photoreceptor cGMP phosphodiesterase. p14 and p18 appear to interact with PDE-5, a major cGMP hydrolyzing enzyme that is present in airway smooth muscle. Phosphorylation of membrane-bound p14/p18 is stimulated by guanine nucleotides, and this correlates with a concurrent reduction in the ability of PKA to activate PDE-5. Phosphorylation of p14/p18 appears to be regulated by a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein-dependent kinase. At present we do not know if an additional G-protein is responsible for regulating PDE-5 independently of p14/p18, although our correlative data tend to favor the idea that p14/p18 is responsible for linking a single G-protein to PDE-5. Further evidence for an interaction between PDE-5 and p14/p18 is the formation of a stable complex between these proteins in cell membranes. Experiments with isobutylmethylxanthine and theophylline show that ligand binding to the catalytic site of PDE-5 appears to affect the phosphorylation of p14/p18 by the G-protein-dependent kinase. Ligand binding to catalytic sites is known to increase binding of cGMP to noncatalytic sites in PDE-5, suggesting that interaction of p14/p18 with PDE-5 may be governed by this occupancy. It follows that the association of p14/p18 with PDE-5 may affect the ability of the former to be phosphorylated by the G-protein-dependent kinase. The identity of the G-protein can be considered on the basis of pertussis toxin sensitivity and may be ascribed to Giα, because Goα is not expressed in these cells (30Grady M. Stevens P. Pyne N.J. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1176: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The G-protein can either bind to p14 and p18 to increase their susceptibility to phosphorylation by an unidentified kinase or increase the activity of this kinase directly. The role of a G-protein in regulating PDE-5 indicates the possibility that this signal transduction pathway may originate from the occupancy of a receptor with extracellular ligand. The proposed model for the regulation of PDE-5 by G-protein is distinct from that explaining the regulation of PDE-6 by its own γ and by transducin. In the latter case, γ inhibits PDE-6 activity whereas G-protein reverses this inhibition. The model proposed for PDE-5 bears some limited analogy with another regulatory mechanism that was recently suggested to modulate activation of PDE-6 in amphibian rod outer segments (17Tsuboi S. Matsumoto H. Jackson K.W. Tsujimoto K. Williams T. Yamazaki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15016-15023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Tsuboi S. Matsumoto H. Yamazaki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15024-15029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this case, when PDE-6γ is complexed with the GTP-bound transducin it is phosphorylated by an unidentified kinase. The phosphorylated γ prevents subsequent activation of PDE-6 by GTP-bound transducin. Two functional regions in the γ subunit of PDE-6, a polycationic (amino acids 24–46) and a C-terminal domain, interact with both transducin and PDE-6 catalytic subunits (31Lipkin V.M. Dumler I.L.

The role of the polycationic domain is to provide a second site for interaction, which serves to increase the affinity of PDE-6γ for PDE-6αβ and transducin. However, the peptide corresponding to this region was shown to inhibit the activation of PDE-5 by PKA. The PDE-6γ antibody was raised to this polycationic region, suggesting that p14 and p18 may also contain a similar domain. On the other hand, PDE-5 contains a region that has some homology with the sites in the PDE-6 catalytic subunits that interact with the polycationic region of PDE-6γ (28Natochin M. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19964-19969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In contrast, PDE-5 does not have a region homologous to the site on PDE-6 that was shown to interact with the C terminus of PDE-6γ. Because the polycationic region in PDE-6γ has not been shown to have any catalytic activity on PDE-6, this suggests either that a similar region in p14 and p18 subserves a different function that may be to modulate the activation of PDE-5 by PKA or that this proposed function is conferred to a different domain(s) in p14 and p18. Our finding that the polycationic peptide prevents the PKA-dependent activation of partially purified PDE-5 favors the former proposal. In conclusion, p14 and p18 are PDE-5-associated proteins that appear to be affected by G-protein and kinase-directed regulation. Along with PDE-6γ they may represent a novel class of proteins that differentially modulate the function of various cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases."
https://openalex.org/W1980987767,"Internalization of a variety of different heptahelical G protein-coupled receptors has been shown to be influenced by a number of different structural determinants of the receptors, including the carboxyl terminus. To investigate the role of the carboxyl terminus of cholecystokinin (CCK) receptors in receptor internalization, the rat wild type (WT) CCK-A receptor (WT CCKAR) and the rat WT CCK-B receptor (WT CCKBR) were truncated after amino acid residue 399 (CCKAR Tr399) and 408 (CCKBR Tr408), thereby deleting the carboxyl-terminal 45 and 44 residues, respectively. All WT and mutant CCK receptors were stably expressed in NIH/3T3 cells. Internalization of the CCKAR Tr399 was not significantly different from the WT CCKAR. In contrast, internalization of the CCKBR Tr408 was decreased to 26% compared with the WT CCKBR internalization of 92%. The mutation of all 10 serine and threonine residues (as potential phosphorylation sites) in the carboxyl terminus of the CCKBR to alanines (mutant CCKBR DeltaS/T) could account for the majority of this effect (39% internalization). All mutant receptors displayed similar ligand binding characteristics, G protein coupling, and signal transduction as their respective WT receptors, indicating that the carboxyl termini are not necessary for these processes. Thus, internalization of the CCKBR, unlike that of the CCKAR, depends on the carboxyl terminus of the receptor. These results suggest that, despite the high degree of homology between CCKAR and CCKBR, the structural determinants that mediate the interaction with the endocytic pathway reside in different regions of the receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1985233926,"SEC4 is an essential gene encoding a small GTPase that is involved in Golgi to cell surface transport inSaccharomyces cerevisiae and is a paradigm for studies on the mode of action of Rab proteins. We describe here the features of interaction of Sec4p with the accessory protein Dss4p. Dss4p is found both on membranes and in the cytosol; however, it is the membrane fraction that is complexed to Sec4p. Dss4p, like its mammalian counterpart, Mss4, binds zinc, and disruption of the zinc-binding site disrupts the ability of the protein to interact with Sec4p.DSS4 overexpression can rescue the lethal phenotype of two alleles of SEC4, corresponding to dominant mutations of Ras. We demonstrate that this suppression is due to the ability of Dss4p to form a tight complex with the mutant forms of Sec4p and hence sequester the mutant protein from its inhibitory effect. These results imply an in vivo role for Dss4p as a guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator. In vitro the protein has the ability to stimulate the dissociation rate of both GDP and GTP from Sec4p. We examined the relationship of GDI1 andDSS4 with SEC4 both genetically and biochemically. These results exclude a role for DSS4 in the recruitment of Sec4p/GDI onto membranes. SEC4 is an essential gene encoding a small GTPase that is involved in Golgi to cell surface transport inSaccharomyces cerevisiae and is a paradigm for studies on the mode of action of Rab proteins. We describe here the features of interaction of Sec4p with the accessory protein Dss4p. Dss4p is found both on membranes and in the cytosol; however, it is the membrane fraction that is complexed to Sec4p. Dss4p, like its mammalian counterpart, Mss4, binds zinc, and disruption of the zinc-binding site disrupts the ability of the protein to interact with Sec4p.DSS4 overexpression can rescue the lethal phenotype of two alleles of SEC4, corresponding to dominant mutations of Ras. We demonstrate that this suppression is due to the ability of Dss4p to form a tight complex with the mutant forms of Sec4p and hence sequester the mutant protein from its inhibitory effect. These results imply an in vivo role for Dss4p as a guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator. In vitro the protein has the ability to stimulate the dissociation rate of both GDP and GTP from Sec4p. We examined the relationship of GDI1 andDSS4 with SEC4 both genetically and biochemically. These results exclude a role for DSS4 in the recruitment of Sec4p/GDI onto membranes. The Sec4 protein belongs to the Rab subgroup of the Ras superfamily of small prenylated GTPases (1Salminen A. Novick P.J. Cell. 1987; 49: 527-538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Although Rab proteins are known to play a crucial role in membrane traffic, their mechanism of action is not well understood. Many Rab proteins have been identified, each being found to have a distinct subcellular localization. This finding has led to the hypothesis that each Rab protein functions at a discrete step of exocytic or endocytic transport although it is not the determinant for docking specificity of transport vesicles (2Brennwald P. Novick P. Nature. 1993; 362: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Sec4p has been shown to play an essential role at the final stage of the secretory pathway in yeast (1Salminen A. Novick P.J. Cell. 1987; 49: 527-538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar) and has been proposed to function in a cyclical fashion to control forward traffic between the Golgi and plasma membrane (3Walworth N.C. Goud B. Kabcenell A.K. Novick P.J. Cell. 1989; 8: 1685-1693Google Scholar). GTP-binding proteins have the ability to assume different nucleotide-dependent conformations, and therefore each can act as a regulatory switch. Generally, by analogy to Ras, the GDP-bound form is thought of as the “resting” or inactive state. Exchange of nucleotide for GTP results in activation of the protein until the GTP is hydrolyzed by the GTPase activator protein-stimulated intrinsic GTPase activity. For Rab proteins, this GDP/GTP cycle is accompanied by a physical cycle of localization between the donor and acceptor compartments (4Goud B. Salminen A. Walworth N.C. Novick P.J. Cell. 1988; 53: 753-768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The cycle of nucleotide binding, hydrolysis, exchange, and localization is modulated through interaction with other proteins. Guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI) 1The abbreviations used are: GDI, guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); DTT, dithiothreitol; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; oligo, oligonucleotide. 1The abbreviations used are: GDI, guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); DTT, dithiothreitol; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; oligo, oligonucleotide. is a general factor that complexes with the GDP-bound forms of Rab proteins, shielding their geranylgeranyl groups from the aqueous environment and hence enabling them to shuttle through the cytoplasm (5Pfeffer S.R. Dirac-Svejstrup A.B. Soldati T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17057-17059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). At the donor compartment, a GDI displacement factor receives GDP-bound Rab protein followed by a guanine nucleotide exchange activity that catalyzes the replacement of GDP with GTP. The GTP-bound Rab protein is then incorporated into secretory vesicles. Current questions in the field have focused on the individual roles played by GDI and exchange factors in promoting the recycling of Rab proteins back onto the donor compartment and preparing them for another round of vesicle attachment. One such accessory factor involved in SEC4 regulation was identified as a spontaneous dominant suppressor of the thermosensitive allele sec4-8 at 34 °C and termed DSS4-1 (6Moya M. Roberts D. Novick P. Nature. 1993; 361: 460-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The gene encoding Dss4p is non-essential in vivo but shows a synthetic negative effect in combination with sec4-8. Biochemical characterization of Dss4p, a 17-kDa, hydrophilic protein, shows that it acts on Sec4p as a GDP dissociation stimulator. Because the intracellular concentration of GTP is in excess of that of GDP, a protein that can affect the release of GDP may have the in vivo property of an exchange factor. In this paper we examine the biological role played by Dss4 in the cycle of Sec4 function. Oligonucleotides were prepared by Monica Talmor, Department of Pathology, Yale University.

DSS4 was myc3-tagged at the C terminus with Kunkel mutagenesis (11Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4881) Google Scholar, 12Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D.

Tagged protein was checked for functionality and found to be identical to untagged protein in all respects. Codon 104 of DSS4 was mutated from cysteine to serine by polymerase chain reaction using the oligos ATATCTGCAGATTGTGATAAAGGTCCTA and TTTATCACAATCTGCAGATATCAAATATTTC. His6-tagged Sec4p was produced in a LEU2integrating vector by Kunkel mutagenesis resulting in insertion of a six-histidine stretch after codon 6 of the wild type protein sequence. Saccharomyces cerevisiae Y190 strain was simultaneously transformed with DNA activation and binding domain constructs. After growing for 5–7 days, transformants were monitored for expression of β-galactosidase activity using a 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside filter lift assay. Transformants were also tested for growth on selective media lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine supplemented with 40 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. Cells were grown overnight in minimal medium containing raffinose before being shifted to 2% galactose containing medium for 6 h. The cells were fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate, pH 6.8, before being prepared for thin sectioning. Electron microscopy was carried out as described (13Govindan B. Bowser R. Novick P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1055-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The yeast fractionation was carried out as described (4Goud B. Salminen A. Walworth N.C. Novick P.J. Cell. 1988; 53: 753-768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). After Zymolyase treatment, cells were homogenized in lysis buffer (0.8 m sorbitol, 20 mm triethanolamine, 1 mm EDTA) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml chymostatin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml antipain, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin) with 20 strokes in a tissue grinder (Pestle A, Wheaton Instrumentation Inc.) and centrifuged at 450 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The S1 supernatant was spun at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to yield supernatant (S2) and pellet fractions (P2). The S2 supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 70 min at 4 °C resulting in S3 and P3 fractions. The P2 and P3 pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer. To generate total membrane (HSP) and cytosolic (HSS) fractions, the S1 supernatant was centrifuged for 1 h at 4 °C at 46,000 rpm in a SW50.1 rotor. Vector pRS316 (14Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was digested with KpnI, blunted followed by digestion withSpeI, and then used to subclone a 2.44-kilobase pairHpaI/SpeI fragment containing GDI1. The resulting plasmid (p54.9) was digested with the following pairs of restriction enzymes, HindIII/KpnI,HindIII/SalI, KpnI/EcoRI,SalI/MscI, and the gapped plasmids were transformed into NY420. After 5 days of growth, the plates were stamped to S.D. at 25 and 37 °C. Only the SalI/MscI gapped plasmid showed loss of growth at 37 °C. Plasmid DNA from these cells were rescued into bacteria. Suppression of thesec19-1 allele was demonstrated by transforming each of the opal, amber, and ochre tRNA suppressors into NY420. Transformants were tested for growth at restrictive temperature. Growth at this temperature was only observed in cells transformed with the opal suppressor. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose in the absence of SDS. To detect the presence of small GTP-binding proteins, after a short incubation in binding buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.3% Tween 20, 1 mm DTT, 10 μm ATP), the filters were incubated with [α-32P]GTP at 1 μCi/ml for 1 h. The blots were then washed 6 times with binding buffer, air-dried, and exposed to film. For the zinc overlay assay the filters were washed in metal binding buffer (MBB, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mmNaCl) for 1 h, incubated with 5–10 μCi of65ZnCl2 (2 Ci/g, NEN Life Science Products) per lane in 5–20 ml of MBB for 30 min to 1 h. Filters were then washed for 15 min in three changes of MBB, wrapped in Saran Wrap, and exposed to XAR film (Eastman Kodak) with an intensifying screen. Carbonic anhydrase included in the SDS-PAGE standards was used as a positive control. Cellular protein extracts were prepared by lysis of spheroplasts in KHEM (50 mm KCl, 10 mm EGTA, 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2, 1.92 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT) containing 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors. Solubilized lysates were cleared by centrifugation in a SW50.1 rotor at 36K for 1 h. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (15Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar), adjusted to 3 mg/ml, and immunoprecipitation carried out using 9E10 ascites fluid. For immunoprecipitation from 35S-labeled lysates, cells in log phase were labeled for 3 h with 100 μCi of Pro-Mix (Amersham Corp.), 1 A 600 unit of cells/ml of media. For SDS-PAGE, samples were heated for 5 min at 100 °C in sample buffer containing 2% SDS and run on 15% slab gels. After transfer to nitrocellulose (BA 83, 0.2 μm, Schleicher & Schuell) blots were probed with primary antibody αYpt1p at a dilution of 1/2000, αYpt51p at a dilution of 1/1000, affinity purified αYpt31p at a dilution of 1/400, αGdi1p at a dilution of 1/3000, 9E10 ascites fluid at a dilution of 1/5000. Recombinant Gdi1p and Dss4p were produced according to previously published protocols (16Roberts D.M. Garrett M.D. Novick P.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 84-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 17Garrett M.D. Novick P.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 232-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 18Novick P. Garrett M.D. Brennwald P. Kabcenell A.K. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 352-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). To isolate the Sec4·GDI1p complex, 100 μg of His6-tagged Sec4p containing membranes were incubated with recombinant Gdi1p in buffer A (0.8 m sorbitol, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm GDP, and protease inhibitors) for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was layered on top of a sorbitol barrier consisting of buffer A containing 1.5 m sorbitol and microcentrifuged for 20 min at 4 °C. Supernatants containing the extracted His6-tagged Sec4p·Gdi1p complex were pooled and incubated for 30 min with a 50% slurry of Pro-Bond resin (Invitrogen) that had been prewashed in buffer A containing 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. The resin was then subjected to four washes with buffer A containing 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin and two washes with buffer B (0.8 m sorbitol, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm GDP, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin). At this stage, the resin was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in buffer B either alone or containing 1.5 μmDss4p. The resin was washed a further three times with buffer B followed by elution of the His6-tagged Sec4p with buffer A containing 50 mm EDTA. Duplicate aliquots of the washes and eluates were prepared for SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with either α-Sec4p or α-Gdi1p. GTP dissociation rates were determined (16Roberts D.M. Garrett M.D. Novick P.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 84-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). GTPγS association was carried out under standard conditions. Sec4p was incubated with either Dss4p or control buffer in the presence of 5 nm[35S]GTPγS at 2 μCi/ml at 30 °C. The reaction was initiated by the addition of recombinant Dss4p. Aliquots of the reaction mixture were removed at various times as indicated and filtered through Millipore nitrocellulose filters. Protein-associated radioactivity was assessed in a scintillation counter. To investigate which Rab proteins are complexed to Dss4p in cellular extracts, native immunoprecipitation studies were performed using an epitope-tagged Dss4. Analysis of the immunoprecipitates by a [α-32P]GTP overlay assay showed the presence of at least two GTP-binding proteins (Fig. 1 A, lane 2). These two proteins were identified as Sec4p and Ypt1p by a second round of immunoprecipitation using protein-specific antibodies (Fig. 1 A, lanes 3 and 4). The immunoprecipitates were also probed for the presence of other candidate Rab proteins as follows: Ypt51p acting along the endocytic route (19Singer-Kruger B. Stenmark H. Dusterhoft A. Philippsen P. Yoo J.S. Gallwitz D. Zerial M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and Ypt31p, theS. cerevisiae homolog of the mammalian Rab protein Rab11 that acts in intra-Golgi transport (20Benli M. Doring F. Robinson D.G. Yang X.P. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6460-6475Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The presence of either Ypt51p or Ypt31p could not be detected by Western blotting of the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1 B). Ypt31p was not present in Dss4p immunoprecipitates even from cells expressing Ypt31p from a multicopy plasmid although it has the ability to interact with Dss4p in a two-hybrid assay (data not shown). It is possible therefore that Dss4p interacts in vivo with only a small subset of Rab proteins or that the affinity of interaction of some Rab proteins is too weak to be revealed biochemically. Dss4p is a hydrophilic protein, so it was of interest to know whether the complex of Dss4p and Sec4p exists on membranes or in the cytosolic fraction. To examine this question, native Dss4 immunoprecipitations were performed from post-nuclear supernatants containing wild type (single copy) levels of Dss4 that were fractionated into 100,000 × g pellet (HSP) and supernatant (HSS) fractions. Fig.2 A shows the relative levels of Dss4p in the HSP and HSS fractions when present at single copy and when expressed from a multicopy plasmid. At single copy, Dss4p is equally distributed between HSP and HSS fractions. Increasing the gene dosage and protein level by expression of DSS4 from a multicopy 2μ plasmid results in the same amount of Dss4p associated with the HSP fraction as when present at single copy. The increased Dss4p level of the lysates from cells overexpressing DSS4 is associated with the HSS fraction suggesting that a saturable number of binding sites for Dss4p exists on the membrane. Fig. 2 B shows the distribution of Sec4p immunoreactivity in the different fractions before and after Dss4p immunoprecipitation with Dss4p expressed at single copy. As previously demonstrated (4Goud B. Salminen A. Walworth N.C. Novick P.J. Cell. 1988; 53: 753-768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), Sec4p is distributed between the membrane fraction and the cytosolic fraction where presumably it is in association with Gdi1p. Fig. 2 Cshows the relative levels of Sec4p associated with the Dss4p immunoprecipitations. The majority of the Sec4p found in Dss4p immunoprecipitates is from the HSP and not the HSS fraction. Consistent with this, the amount of Sec4 immunoreactivity remaining in the post-immunoprecipitation supernatants is depleted compared with the levels of Sec4p prior to immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2 B). In the post-immunoprecipitation supernatants, the level of Sec4p associated with the cytosolic HSS fraction is relatively unchanged, and Sec4p immunoreactivity is depleted from the membrane-associated HSP fraction. These data clearly show that the Sec4p·Dss4p complex is present in the HSP or membrane-associated fraction; presumably Sec4p, which is membrane-associated via its C-terminal prenylation, recruits Dss4p onto the membrane although other factors may also play a role in this process. Studies on Rab proteins have been greatly facilitated by knowledge of p21 ras structure/function obtained through mutational analysis and structural studies. Dominant negative point mutations of Ras superfamily members have been used to disrupt wild type protein function. Expression of the dominant negative alleles ofSEC4, with SEC4 N34 andSEC4 I133 behind the regulatable GAL1promoter leads to lethality when these cells are grown with galactose as the carbon source (Table II (3Walworth N.C. Goud B. Kabcenell A.K. Novick P.J. Cell. 1989; 8: 1685-1693Google Scholar)). These point mutations are in the guanine nucleotide-binding site at positions conserved between all Ras superfamily members. SEC4 I133 contains an asparagine to isoleucine substitution and results in a protein unable to bind guanine nucleotides. This SEC4 allele is a dominant negative inhibitor of membrane traffic in yeast (3Walworth N.C. Goud B. Kabcenell A.K. Novick P.J. Cell. 1989; 8: 1685-1693Google Scholar).SEC4 N34 contains a substitution of asparagine for serine at a position that is conserved for all small GTPases and is analogous to the dominant blocking allele Ras Asn-17. In Ras, this mutant may accommodate GDP in its binding pocket but probably adopts a structure intermediate between the GDP- and GTP-bound states (21Farnsworth C.L. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4822-4829Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The lethality of SEC4 I133 andSEC4 N34 can be suppressed with DSS4present on a multicopy plasmid (Table I). The phenotype of these cells was studied by electron microscopy. Cells expressingSEC4 N34 or SEC4 I133 (Fig.3, A and C, respectively) both showed a dramatic accumulation of secretory vesicles when grown in galactose-containing medium to induce expression of the mutant genes (Fig. 3, A and C (22Walworth N.C. Novick P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar)). The vesicles are similar in size and appearance to vesicles present in other late secretory mutants that accumulate post-Golgi vesicles. These data directly demonstrate that although expression of SEC4 I133and SEC4 N34 induces dominant secretory defects resulting in lethality, the formation of secretory vesicles is not inhibited. Similar analysis of SEC4 I133 andSEC4 N34 expressing strains harboring a multicopy plasmid containing DSS4 shows a normal cellular morphology, the vesicle accumulation has been alleviated, and the cells are now viable (Fig. 3, B and D). DSS4 can suppress the dominant acting alleles of SEC4, and this provides an in vivo assay for DSS4 function.Table IIEffect of multicopy DSS4 and GDI1 on the viability of SEC4 mutantsSec4 constructAmino acid change2μ plasmidGlucoseGalactoseWild typeNoneVector only++N34Ser34 → AsnVector only+−I133Asn133 → IIeVector only+−Wild typeNoneGDI1++N34Ser34 → AsnGDI1+−I133Asn133 → IIeGDI1+−Wild typeNoneDSS4++N34Ser34 → AsnDSS4++I133Asn133 → IIeDSS4++SEC4 and mutants were expressed under the control of the glucose-repressible GAL1 promoter.

Plus represents viability and minus inviability for growth on the carbon source as indicated. In the case of Ras, the Ser to Asn and Asn to Ile cognate mutants disrupt normal protein function by competing for GEF interactions to form a stable, catalytically inactive complex (23Hwang Y.W. McCabe P.G. Innis M.A. Miller D.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 274: 394-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the relevant GEF can alleviate the block by tightly complexing with these mutants, which probably adopt a conformation corresponding to a transition state assisted by the GEF (23Hwang Y.W. McCabe P.G. Innis M.A. Miller D.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 274: 394-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 24Hwang Y.-W. Zhong J.-M. Poullet P. Parmeggiani A. J. Biol.

We examined the direct interactions between Dss4p and the Sec4p dominant negative alleles with the yeast two-hybrid system and by immunoprecipitation from yeast lysates. In the two-hybrid assay, direct physical interaction between two proteins can be tested by fusing one of the candidate proteins to the DNA binding domain of a transcription factor. The other candidate is fused to the activation domain of the transcription factor, and interactions between the two candidates are monitored by transcriptional activation of the reporter genes,lacZ and HIS3. Table III shows a summary of these interactions monitored by β-galactosidase activity, and Fig.4 demonstrates growth of two-hybrid pairs on selective media. The DSS4 construct was screened against a panel consisting of SEC4 wild type and various alleles ofSEC4 as indicated. Sec4ΔC contains a deletion of the C-terminal cysteines that are necessary for geranylgeranylation and thus membrane attachment of the protein. Sec4L79 protein is deficient in GTP hydrolysis (27Walworth N.C. Brennwald P. Kabcenell A.K. Garrett M. Novick P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2017-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) as has also been demonstrated for other Rab proteins (28Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lutcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). As predicted from the in vivo suppression data, Dss4p strongly interacts with the Asn-34 and Ile-133 alleles of Sec4p, weakly with the wild type Sec4p, and not at all with the Leu-79 allele. The level of interaction was unchanged regardless of whether the SEC4 construct was lacking the C-terminal prenylation motif, indicating that the observed interaction does not require the geranylgeranylation of Sec4p.Table IIITwo-hybrid interactions of Sec4 mutantsSec4 constructAmino acid changeClassDss4 bindingGDI bindingWild type++++ΔCCys214,215→ ΔWild-type protein lacking C-terminal prenylation+−I133Asn133 → IIeNucleotide binding deficient++++−N34Ser34 → AsnEquivalent to Ras Asn-17++++−L79Gln79 → LeuGTPase-deficient−NDβ-Galactosidase activity was determined by filter assay.

Cells were metabolically labeled with35S followed by 9E10 (α-myc epitope monoclonal) immunoprecipitations of the detergent-solubilized lysates. Lanes 1 and 2 are derived from lysates of cells expressingSEC4 N34 and lanes 3 and 4from cells expressing SEC4 I133. Dss4p efficiently co-precipitated the mutant protein forming a complex stable in the presence of 1% Triton X-100 (Fig. 5). These results indicate that Dss4p can tightly associate with nucleotide-free conformations of Sec4p and hence sequester the mutant protein from its inhibitory function. Overexpression ofGDI1 does not suppress the SEC4 N34mutant (Table II), although such a mutant allele is predicted to be GDP-associated which is favored for interaction with GDI. This result suggests that the Sec4"
https://openalex.org/W1981573675,"The common α subunit of glycoprotein hormones contains five disulfide bonds. Based on the published crystal structure, the assignments are 7–31, 59–87, 10–60, 28–82, and 32–84; the last three comprise the cystine knot, a structure also seen in a variety of growth factors. Previously, we demonstrated that the efficiency of secretion and the ability to form heterodimers by α subunits bearing single cysteine residue mutants in the cystine knot were significantly reduced. These results suggested that the cystine knot is critical for the intracellular integrity of the subunit. To assess if the presence of the free thiol affected the secretion kinetics, we constructed paired cysteine mutants of each disulfide bond of the α subunit. The secretion rate for these monomers was comparable with wild type except for the α-10–60 mutant, which was 40% lower. The recovery of the α7–31 and α59–87 mutants was greater than 95%, whereas for the cystine knot mutants, it was 20–40%. Co-expression of the wild-type chorionic gonadotropin β subunit with double cysteine mutants did not enhance the recovery of α mutants in the media. Moreover, compared with wild-type, the efficiency of heterodimer formation of the α10–60 or α32–84 mutants was less than 5%. Because subunit assembly is required for biological activity, studies on the role of these disulfide bonds in signal transduction were not possible. To bypass the assembly step, we exploited the single chain model, where the α and β subunits are genetically fused. The recovery of secreted tethered gonadotropins bearing mutations in the cystine knot was increased significantly. Although dimer-specific monoclonal antibodies discriminated the conformation of single chain α10–60 and α32–84 mutants from the native heterodimer, these mutants were nevertheless biologically active. Thus, individual bonds of cystine knot are important for secretion and heterodimer formation but not for in vitro bioactivity. Moreover, the data suggest that the native heterodimer configuration is not a prerequisite for receptor binding or signal transduction."

The mCD156 gene is composed of 24 exons and 23 introns and spans approximately 14 kilobases. The first exon encodes most of the signal peptide sequence, and the transmembrane region is encoded by a single exon (19). In contrast, the other regions are composed of multiple exons. Of these, exons 7–12 and 12–15 encode a metalloprotease domain and a disintegrin domain, respectively. Sequence analysis of the 5′-flanking DNA revealed many potential regulatory motifs.

The mCD156 cDNA is 3.2 kb long with an open reading frame encoding 826 amino acids. The extracellular region consisting of 644 amino acids has a metalloprotease (MTP) domain containing the zinc-binding consensus histidine and protease catalytic glutamic residues and a disintegrin domain containing a platelet aggregation inhibitor-like structure, whereas the cytoplasmic region consisting of 143 amino acids contains a proline-rich amino acid sequence containing consensus SH3 (Src homology 3) binding sequence. mCD156 plays a role in infiltration of leukocytes by leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells and degradation of vascular basement membrane (3Higuchi Y.

ADAMs 1–7 are expressed in reproductive organs, mainly the testes, and are implicated in sperm-egg fusion and spermatogenesis. ADAMs 8–12 (meltrin-α) and 15 (metargidin) are of non-reproductive cell origin, including myeloid, muscle, brain, and breast cells. ADAM 12 has been shown to mediate myocyte cell fusion.

Another new family protein designated ADAMST-1 appears to contain thrombospondin-like structures and play a role in tumor cell migration (18Kuno K. Kanada N. Nakashima E. Fujiki F. Ichimura F.

We report here the isolation and characterization of the mCD156 gene and the presence of the cell type-specific, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon (IFN)-γ-inducible promoter activities in its 5′ upstream sequence. We have also determined the mCD156 gene location. Restriction enzymes were purchased from Takara (Kyoto, Japan), Toyobo (Osaka, Japan), Life Technologies, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD), and Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). Agarose ultrapure DNA grade was from Takara. The DNA ligation kit, reverse transcriptase, S1 nuclease, and mung bean nuclease were obtained from Takara, and bovine alkaline phosphatase was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim (Tokyo, Japan). LPS (Escherichia coli serotype 055:B5) was obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Mouse IFN-γ was purchased from Genzyme (Cambridge, MA). Radioactive nucleotides [α-32P]dCTP (3,000 Ci/mmol) and [γ-32P]ATP (6,000 Ci/mmol) were obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Chemicals used for DNA sequencing were obtained from Toyobo. X-ray film (XAR-351) was obtained from Kodak (Rochester, NY). Murine macrophage cell line aHINS-B3 and murine glioblastoma cell line G203 were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing fetal calf serum. The bacteriophage EMBL-3 murine liver library was produced as described previously (19Matsuura K. Ishida T. Setoguchi M. Higuchi Y. Akizuki S. Yamamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21787-21794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Miyazaki Y. Setoguchi M. Yoshida S. Higuchi Y. Akizuki S. Yamamoto S. J. Biol.

Briefly, genomic DNA prepared from BALB/c murine liver was partially digested withMboI, followed by size fractionation via sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. The DNA fragments in the size range of 12–20 kb were inserted into the BamHI site of EMBL-3 arms. The annealed DNA was packaged using a commercial packaging extract (Stratagene Cloning Systems, La Jolla, CA), and then the phage was grown in E. coli Q359 and screened as described. Radioactive probes were prepared by 32P labeling cDNA inserts from an mCD156 clone (1Yoshida S. Setoguchi M. Higuchi Y. Akizuki S. Yamamoto S. Int. Immunol. 1990; 2: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) using nick translation (21Rigby P.W.J. Dickman M. Rhodes C. Berg P. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 113: 237-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (6965) Google Scholar), with a specific activity of 108 cpm/μg of DNA. Filters containing recombinant plaques were screened according to the procedure of Benton and Davis (22Benton W.D. Davis R.W. Science. 1977; 196: 180-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2924) Google Scholar), prehybridized at 42 °C in 6 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's solution for 4 h, and hybridized with 106cpm/ml 32P-labeled insert at 42 °C for 20 h. The filters were exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film with a Fuji intensifying screen at −80 °C for 2 days. Phage clones were subsequently purified by repeated screening cycles. Large scale phage DNA and minipreparations were obtained as described by Maniatis et al. (23Maniatis T. Fritsch F.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). DNA fragments originating from the genomic DNA inserts of phage clones were subcloned into pUC118/119. The pUC118/119 vectors were linearized and ligated for 12 h at 16 °C using a ligation kit purchased from Takara. The ligated DNA was used to transform MV1184 cells. White bacterial colonies were selected. Nucleotide sequences were determined by dideoxy chain termination (24Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar, 25Setoguchi M. Higuchi Y. Yoshida S. Nasu N. Miyazaki S. Akizuki S. Yamamoto S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4515-4522Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) using single-stranded plasmid DNA with modifications as described in the Sequenase technical manual (Toyobo). Nucleotide sequences were determined on DNA subcloned in pUC118/119 vectors using pUC primers. Other oligonucleotides used as primers for sequencing were synthesized using an automated DNA synthesizer (model 8700, Biosearch). Sequences were determined on both strands. S1 nuclease mapping was performed according to a modified method of Berg and Sharp (26Berg A.J. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1978; 12: 721-732Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1570) Google Scholar). A single-stranded DNA corresponding to theSalI-BamHI fragment containing the region from the 5′ upstream to intron 1 of the mCD156 gene was prepared using M13KO7 phage as a vector and annealed with an end-labeled oligonucleotide primer, a synthetic 30-base single-stranded oligomer (3′-TGGTGTCCATAAGACGCTGAGCAGCCAGAG-5′) corresponding to bp +143 to +172 of the first exon of the mCD156 gene. The annealed DNA was incubated with 400 μm dNTPs and 10 units of the Klenow fragment ofE. coli DNA polymerase for 30 min at 37 °C. The mixture was heated to 65 °C for 5 min to inactivate the Klenow fragment and then chilled on ice. After digestion with PstI and alkali denaturation, the extended primer was separated on alkaline gel electrophoresis. Total RNA, 50 μg from aHINS-B3 cells, was then hybridized for 16 h at 50 °C with the extended primer in 40 mm Pipes, pH 6.4, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, and 80% formamide. Following hybridization, the reaction was diluted 10-fold with S1 nuclease buffer (300 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, and 3 mmZnCl2), and 10 μg of salmon sperm DNA. S1 nuclease (130 units) was added. The reaction mixture was then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction mixture was terminated by the addition of termination buffer (2.5 m ammonium acetate and 50 mm EDTA), and the DNA·RNA hybrids were extracted with phenol, precipitated with ethanol, resuspended in 80% formamide, heated to 90 °C, and resolved on a 6% acrylamide, 8 murea gel. The probe for primer extension analysis was the end-labeled synthetic 30-base single stranded oligomer used in the S1 nuclease protection. Total cellular RNA was isolated from aHINS-B3 cells. The primer was annealed to 100 μg of total RNA by heating the reaction mixture for 15 min at 80 °C in 20 μl of 80% formamide, containing 400 mm NaCl, 40 mmPipes, pH 6.4, and 1 mm EDTA. The resulting DNA·RNA hybrid was ethanol precipitated and dissolved in reverse transcriptase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm2-mercaptoethanol KCl, 10 mm MgCl2) in the presence of 1 mm deoxynucleotides, 100 units of reverse transcriptase, and 60 units of RNase inhibitor. After 90 min at 42 °C, the DNA·RNA hybrids were phenol extracted, ethanol precipitated, dissolved in loading buffer (95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol FF), heated to 90 °C, and resolved on a 6% acrylamide, 8 murea sequencing gel. mCD156G1 clone containing the 2776-bp nucleotides corresponding to bases −2279 to 498 of the 5′ upstream, exon 1 and intron 1 sequence of the mCD156 gene was digested with XbaI and SphI. The insert in the linealized DNA was 3′ deleted with exonuclease III. Aliquots (2.5 μl) were removed 1-min intervals and mixed with 50 μl of 2 × mung bean nuclease buffer. After heating for 5 min at 65 °C, the samples were incubated with mung bean nuclease for 60 min at 37 °C. The 3′-deleted samples were then digested with the Klenow fragment followed by T4 DNA ligase treatment. To determine the extent of deletion, each mutant was sequenced as described previously (19Matsuura K. Ishida T. Setoguchi M. Higuchi Y. Akizuki S. Yamamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21787-21794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Selected mutants was digested with HindIII and inserted into theHindIII site of the multicloning site containing pSVmCAT. This plasmid containing the 2033-bp nucleotides corresponding to bases −1943 to 90 was digested with KpnI-SmaI and subjected to successive treatment with exonuclease III, mung bean nuclease, and Klenow fragment as above. Each 5′-deleted DNA was ligated with T4 DNA ligase. Plasmid DNA was prepared by alkaline lysis followed by two centrifugation steps through CsCl to isolate supercoiled plasmid DNA. Plasmid DNA was transfected into the mouse macrophage line aHINS-B3 and the mouse glioblastoma line G203 by calcium phosphate coprecipitation as described previously (19Matsuura K. Ishida T. Setoguchi M. Higuchi Y. Akizuki S. Yamamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21787-21794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were seeded at 2 × 106 cells/plate. For transient transfections, a mixture of the test CAT hybrid gene (20 μg equivalent) and the transfection control plasmid (20 μg) pCH110 containing the β-galactosidase gene was precipitated in Hepes-buffered saline, pH 7.1, and then added to the plates. After 4 h, the cells were given a 1.5-min glycerol shock followed by a wash with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Fresh medium was then added and the incubation continued for 24 h. 24 h after transfection, the cells were stimulated with LPS (100 ng/ml) or IFN-γ (200 units/ml) for 16 and 24 h, respectively. Cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, incubated with 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA for 5 min on ice, harvested by scraping and centrifugation, and resuspended in 180 μl of 0.25 mTris-HCl, pH 8.0. Extracts were prepared by freeze-thaw and centrifuged. Supernatants were collected and assayed for protein according to the method of Bradford (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217529) Google Scholar). CAT was assayed as described previously (19Matsuura K. Ishida T. Setoguchi M. Higuchi Y. Akizuki S. Yamamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21787-21794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extract was incubated with [14C]chloramphenicol and 0.2 mg of acetyl-CoA for 1.5 h at 37 °C, and the products were separated by thin layer chromatography. The CAT activity for each construct was normalized to β-galactosidase activity from the same sample. The relative CAT activity for each deletion mutant was expressed as a percentage of that of wild type −390/+90CAT stimulated with LPS. Mouse chromosomes were prepared according to a published procedure (28Feng G.S. Shen R. Heng H.H.Q. Tsui L.-C. Kazlauskas A. Pawson T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1745-1750PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, lymphocytes were isolated from mouse spleen and cultured at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum, 3 μg/ml concanavalin A, 10 μg/ml LPS, and 5 × 10−5m 2-mercaptoethanol. After 44 h, the cultured lymphocytes were treated with 0.18 mg/ml bromodeoxyuridine (Sigma) for an additional 14 h. The synchronized cells were washed and recultured at 37 °C for 4 h in α-minimal essential medium with thymidine (2.5 μg/ml) (Sigma). Chromosome slides were made by the conventional method used for human chromosome preparation (hypotonic treatment, fixation, and air drying). The genomic DNA of mCD156G2 containing a 15-kb insert spanning nearly the entire coding regions except the most 5′ end (see Fig. 1) were biotinylated with dATP using the Life Technologies, Inc. BioNick labeling kit (15 °C, 1 h) (29Heng H.H.Q. Tsui L.-C. Chromosoma ( Berl. ). 1993; 102: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). The procedure for FISH detection was performed according to the method of Heng et al. (30Heng H.H.Q. Squire J. Tsui L.-C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9509-9513Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) and Heng and Tsui (29Heng H.H.Q. Tsui L.-C. Chromosoma ( Berl. ). 1993; 102: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Briefly, slides were baked at 55 °C for 1 h. After RNase A treatment, the slides were denatured in 70% formamide in 2 × SSC for 2 min at 70 °C, followed by dehydration with ethanol. The probe was denatured at 75 °C for 5 min in a hybridization mix consisting of 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, and human cot I DNA, and prehybridized at 37 °C for 15 min. The probe was then loaded on the denatured slides. After overnight hybridization, slides were washed and detected as well as amplified using a published method, FISH signals and the DAPI banding pattern were recorded separately by taking photographs, and the assignment of the FISH mapping data with chromosomal bands was achieved by superimposing FISH signals on DAPI-banded chromosomes (30Heng H.H.Q. Squire J. Tsui L.-C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9509-9513Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 31Heng H.H.Q. Tsui L.-C. FISH Detection on DAPI Banded Chromosomes. Humana Press, Clifton, NJ1994Crossref Google Scholar). The mCD156 mRNA was 3.1 kb (Fig. 1), from which mCD156 cDNA was cloned and characterized (1Yoshida S. Setoguchi M. Higuchi Y. Akizuki S. Yamamoto S. Int. Immunol. 1990; 2: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). A genomic library, prepared from anMboI partial digest of BALB/c mouse DNA inserted into EMBL-3, was screened using randomly labeled mCD156 cDNA. Two positive clones, designated mCD156G1 and mCD156G2, were selected for further analysis. Mapping and sequence analysis of these inserts established that clone mCD156G1 contained nearly the entire 5′ half of the message for mCD156 but not for the 3′ half of the gene, whereas clone mCD156G2 contained a 15-kb insert spanning nearly the entire coding regions except the most 5′ end. The mCD156 gene is composed of about 14 kb, 24 exons and 23 introns. Fig. 1 is a line drawing of the intron-exon organization of the gene. The introns range in size from 71 (intron 11) to 2,687 (intron 22) bp. Large introns (intron 1, 907 bp; intron 2, 1,340 bp; and 22) occur on the 5′ and 3′ side of the gene, and a cluster of exons is found between them. Analysis of splice junction sequences revealed that all intron-exon junctions followed the normal consensus sequence rules (32Brenathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 349-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3298) Google Scholar), except at intron 11 where the acceptor splice site AG was replaced by TA (Table I). Exons comprise approximately 22.8% of the gene; about 18% of the total gene actually codes for amino acids.Table IExon-intron organization of the mCD156 geneExon no.Exon size5′ Splice siteIntron size3′ Splice sitebpbp−111173CACCAGgtgagt907ctgaagCAGTAGP AV A24252104CACTGGgtaagt1340atccagGGCCAGH WG Q6061377GAACAGgtaagc142ttccagGGACCT N RD L8687479GAGCAGgtatgg77ccttagGACCATE QD H112113577CCTCAGgtatnt477cctcagGGGCTT L RG F1731746184CCACGGgtgagc216ccctagAACTGGP RN W194195763CAAGAGgtatgg82ttccagTTCCAGQ EF Q217218869GACAAGgtgggt173ctgcagCTTTATD KL Y2732749167TATCACgtgagt166ttccagGGGGGT I TG V3003011082AATCAGgtaact245tcatagGACCACN QD H35035111148GCATCGgtagtc71cccataGCTCCAI GS K40941012179CCTCAGgtctgt291tcccagGACTGTP QD C4394401390TGCAAGgtaagt96gaccagGTGAAGC KV K50350414190GGCCAGgtgagg84ccacagGTGCTCP GA R5285291576TGGCAGgtaagc264ctgcagGATCAA G RI N58358416166GGAAAGgtgagt392ttccagGTTTGCG KV C6096101778CATGGGgtatgt397ctccagGTATGCH GV C6416421894AAGCAGgtaagg498tcccagCGTCTAA AS T67968019115GAGGAGgtgagg693gcctagGAGTGT R RS V73273320160CCTGCAgtaagt461ctcaagCCTCCAP AP P7547552166AATCAGgtaagc473caatagTTTAGAN QF R7717722251AAGCAGgtaagg2687tcccagGTCAAGK QV K7967972375ACTCAGgtgagc424tggcagGGAGCTT QG A24587ATAGATcaatcaCodon numbers are above the nucleotide sequence. Open table in a new tab Codon numbers are above the nucleotide sequence. Exons are often associated with separate structural or functional domains of a protein (32Brenathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 349-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3298) Google Scholar), such as in the immunoglobulin (33Rogers J. Early P. Carter C. Calame K. Bond M. Hood L. Wall R. Cell. 1980; 20: 303-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). However, the exon organization of the mCD156 gene is partially predictable based on the predicted protein structure (Figs. 1 and 2). The mCD156 protein is composed of a signal peptide, a pro-MTP, an MTP, a disintegrin, a CR, an EGF, a transmembrane, and a cytoplasmic domain. The first exon encodes most of the signal peptide sequence, and the transmembrane domain is encoded by a single exon (25Setoguchi M. Higuchi Y. Yoshida S. Nasu N. Miyazaki S. Akizuki S. Yamamoto S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4515-4522Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In contrast, other regions are comprised of multiple exons. Exons 2–6 encode a pro-MTP domain; exons 7–12, an MTP domain; exons 12–14, a disintegrin domain; exons 14–18, a CR domain, including an EGF domain within exons 17–18. The cytoplasmic region shows a proline-rich amino acid stretch that is encoded by exons 20–23. The carboxyl-terminal residues that have little proline and the total 3′-untranslated region are encoded by exon 24. The exon-intron organization of the ADAM 11 gene has been reported (34Katagiri T. Harada Y. Emi M. Nakamura Y. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1995; 68: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The numbers of its exons and introns were 25 and 26, respectively, resembling those of the mCD156 gene. Therefore, we compared amino acids encoded by each exon between mCD156 and ADAM 11 (Fig. 2). It is of note that 12 exons out of 24 of mCD156 correspond to the homologous regions of exons of ADAM 11; for example, the boundary between exons 3 and 4 of the mCD156 gene corresponds to that between exons 1 and 2 of the ADAM 11 gene. The transcription start sites of the mCD156 gene were analyzed by S1 nuclease protection. An antisense single-stranded DNA probe (231 bp) corresponding to the region spanning from site (+172) to an upstreamPstI site (−183) (see “Experimental Procedures”) was constructed. The results suggested the presence of a major transcription start site approximately 114 nucleotides upstream of the translation start site (Fig. 3 A). The transcriptional initiation site demonstrated by S1 nuclease protection was confirmed by primer extension (see “Experimental Procedures”). An antisense synthetic oligonucleotide was used for primer extension using RNA isolated from aHINS-B3 cells and reverse transcriptase. A single transcriptional initiation site 134 nucleotides upstream of the translation start site was identified (Fig. 3 B), which confirmed the S1 nuclease result. The 5′ upstream region contained a number of potential regulatory sequences, as shown in (Fig. 4). TATA box-related elements (TATAGA) were identified at positions −25 to −20, possibly directing transcription from the indicated position +1 (Fig. 4). Although it differs from the canonical sequence by a G in the 5th position and although G and C are rare in TATA sequences and are associated with down-mutations in some promoters, the human β-globin promoter TATA box contains a G (35Mayers R.M. Tilly K. Maniatis T. Science. 1986; 232: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Other TATA box-related sequences, TATAA and AAATTT, are found further upstream, although these sequences appears to be too distant to direct transcription from the cap site. Another regulatory element, the atypical GC box-related motif GGGAGG (CCTCCC), is located at positions −295 to −290 and −231 to −226. Commonly, binding sites for Sp-1 are located near the TATA box, but in some cases, such as hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase, they are further upstream (36Reynolds G.A. Basu S.K. Osborne T.F.

The CAAT (ATTG) box and its reverse sequences are found at positions −225 to −222, −217 to −214, −168 to −164, and −112 to −109 (37Chodosh L.A. Baldwin A.S. Carthew R.W. Sharp P.A.

An NF-1 binding site exists at positions −49 to −37 (39Gronostajski R.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5545-5559Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The interleukin (IL)-6 response element motif, CTGGGA (TCCCAG), is found at positions −621 to −616 and −200 to −195. The IL-6 response element is present in many acute phase response genes such as mouse serum amyloid A, rat α2-macroglobulin, and C-reactive protein (40Kunz D. Zimmermann R. Heisig M. Heinrich P.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 1121-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and in the complement component 5 gene. The NF-IL-6 binding site and its reverse sequence are located at positions −591 to −588, −422 to −415, and −324 to −318. A minimal motif of IFN-stimulated response element, GAAANN, and its reverse sequence exists in the region between −358 and −338 (41Sims S.H. Cha Y. Romine M.F. Gao P.-Q. Gottlieb K. Deisseroth A.B.

However, net differences in enzyme production between acute and chronic wounds may be modulated by soluble factors present within the tissue environment. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, FGF-2) and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF, FGF-9), which are produced during wound healing, inhibited collagenase-1 expression by keratinocytes in a dose-dependent manner. However, KGF was >100-fold more effective than bFGF at inhibiting collagenase-1 expression, suggesting that this differential signaling is transduced via an FGF receptor that binds these ligands with different affinities. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis of human keratinocyte mRNA for fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) revealed expression of only FGFR-2 IIIb, the KGF-specific receptor, which also binds bFGF with low affinity, and FGFR-3 IIIb, which does not bind bFGF or KGF. FGFRs that bind bFGF with high affinity were not detected. Our results suggest that bFGF and KGF inhibit collagenase-1 expression through the KGF cell-surface receptor (FGFR-2 IIIb). Because bFGF induces collagenase-1 in most cell types, cell-specific expression of FGFR family members may dictate the regulation of matrix metalloproteinases in a tissue-specific manner.

Wound repair is a highly organized process that requires a series of spatially and temporally regulated events to heal a tissue defect. Among these, effective proteolytic degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; bFGF, basic FGF; MMP, matrix metalloproteinases; TGF, transforming growth factor; KGF, keratinocyte growth factor; FGFR, FGF receptor; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; bp, base pair(s). 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; bFGF, basic FGF; MMP, matrix metalloproteinases; TGF, transforming growth factor; KGF, keratinocyte growth factor; FGFR, FGF receptor; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; bp, base pair(s). macromolecules by various proteases is necessary to remodel the damaged tissue, promote neovascularization, and facilitate efficient migration of cells during re-epithelialization (1Mignatti P. Rifkin D.B. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. Clark R.A.F. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of Wound Repair. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1996: 427-474Google Scholar). Yet, in chronic ulcers, the overproduction of matrix-degrading proteases and/or the lack of production of their natural inhibitors probably contributes to the underlying pathogenesis of the non-healing state by interfering with normal repair processes and by perpetuating matrix destruction. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) constitute a family of zinc-dependent enzymes that collectively have the capacity to degrade virtually all components of the ECM (2Birkedal-Hansen H. Moore W.G.I. Bodden M.K. Windsor L.J. Birkedal-Hansen B. DeCarlo A. Engler J.A. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1993; 4: 197-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2631) Google Scholar). While most members of this family possess overlapping substrate specificities, the metallocollagenases, a subgroup of the MMP gene family, have the unique ability to initiate cleavage of fibrillar collagens I, II, and III at a specific locus in their triple helical domain. At physiologic temperature, cleaved collagen molecules denature into gelatin and become susceptible to further digestion by other proteases. Of the three known human collagenases, collagenase-1 (MMP-1) is the enzyme principally responsible for collagen turnover in most tissues and, in particular, the skin. Previous studies from our laboratories and others have shown that basal keratinocytes at the leading edge of migration in both normally healing wounds and chronic ulcers invariantly express collagenase-1 (3Saarialho-Kere U.K. Chang E.S. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1952-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 4Stricklin G.P. Li L. Jancic V. Wenczak B.A. Nanney L.B. Am. J.

Dermatol. 1995; 104: 982-988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Signal for collagenase-1 is confined to the basal layer of epidermis, diminishes progressively away from the wound edge, and is absent in intact skin. Furthermore, collagenase-1 expression is rapidly induced in wound edge keratinocytes after injury, persists during the healing phase, and ceases following wound closure (6Inoue M. Kratz G. Haegerstrand A. Ståhle-Bäckdahl M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 104: 479-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In chronic, non-healing wounds expression of this MMP is prominent and excessive, whereas in normally healing wounds its expression is transient and localized precisely to areas of active re-epithelialization (3Saarialho-Kere U.K. Chang E.S. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1952-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 7Saarialho-Kere U.K. Kovacs S.O. Pentland A.P. Olerud J. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. J. Clin.

We have demonstrated that collagenase-1 expression by basal keratinocytes is induced following contact with native type I collagen, 2B. D. Sudbeck, B. K. Pilcher, H. G. Welgus, and W. C. Parks, (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, in press. 2B. D. Sudbeck, B. K. Pilcher, H. G. Welgus, and W. C. Parks, (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, in press. and the activity of this enzyme is required for cell migration (9Pilcher B.K. Sudbeck B.D. Dumin J. Krane S.M. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Thus, expression of matrix-degrading enzymes by keratinocytes during cutaneous wound repair is a normal and programmed response to injury, and altered cell-matrix interactions may play a critical role in regulating this response. In addition to cell-matrix interactions, soluble mediators present in the ECM during wound repair may influence collagenase-1 expression. Keratinocyte collagenase-1 production is stimulated by several growth factors including transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α)/epidermal growth factor (10Lyons J.G. Birkedal-Hansen B. Pierson M.C.

Furthermore, several of these growth factors (e.g.epidermal growth factor and hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor) can augment ECM-directed collagenase-1 expression by keratinocytes (11Dunsmore S.E.

In effect, while cell contact with specific matrices establishes the primary “on and off” signals, soluble mediators may finely control the net output of collagenase-1 by keratinocytes. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, FGF-2) and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF, FGF-9) belong to a family of heparin-binding growth factors that exert a variety of effects on multiple cell types (16Basilico C. Moscatelli D. Adv. Cancer Res. 1992; 59: 115-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). bFGF is widely expressed in vivo, is a potent angiogenic factor, and induces collagenase-1 production by cultured fibroblasts (17Chua C.C.

Med. 1990; 172: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Likewise, inhibition of KGF signaling in basal keratinocytes of epidermis following injury impairs re-epithelialization, presumably by inhibiting keratinocyte proliferation (31Werner S. Smola H. Liao X. Longaker M.T. Krieg T. Hofschneider P.H. Williams L.T. Science. 1994; 266: 819-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate that bFGF and KGF down-regulate collagenase-1 expression by keratinocytes in a cell type-specific manner. Additionally, we show that KGF is >100-fold more potent than bFGF in suppressing collagenase-1 production and that keratinocytes express only two fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs): FGFR-3 IIIb, which does not bind bFGF or KGF, and FGFR-2 IIIb, which binds KGF with high affinity, but poorly to bFGF. Thus, bFGF and KGF inhibition of keratinocyte collagenase-1 expression probably occurs exclusively through the KGF (FGFR-2 IIIb) receptor. Recombinant human bFGF, recombinant human KGF, and a polyclonal neutralizing antiserum to bFGF were obtained from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Bovine type I collagen (Vitrogen-100) was purchased from Celltrix Laboratories (Palo Alto, CA). Human keratinocytes were harvested from healthy adult skin from reduction mammoplasties or abdominoplasties as described previously (15Sudbeck B.D. Parks W.C. Welgus H.G. Pentland A.P. J. Biol.

Briefly, the subcutaneous fat and deep dermis were removed, and the remaining tissue was incubated in 0.25% trypsin in phosphate-buffered saline. After 16 h, the epidermis was separated from the dermis with forceps, and the keratinocytes were scraped into Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The keratinocyte suspension was added to fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and 0.1% penicillin/streptomycin. A specified amount of keratinocyte suspension was then plated onto tissue culture dishes coated with 1 mg/ml Vitrogen. Under these culture conditions, the keratinocytes proliferate, migrate, differentiate, and cornify similar to cells in vivo. Growth on native type I collagen is necessary for induction of collagenase-1 and keratinocyte adhesion (5Saarialho-Kere U.K. Vaalamo M. Airola K. Niemi K.-M. Oikarinen A.I. Parks W.C. J. Invest.

The amount of collagenase-1 accumulated in keratinocyte-conditioned medium was measured by indirect competitive ELISA (33Cooper T.W. Bauer E.A. Eisen A.Z. Collagen Relat.

This ELISA is completely specific for collagenase-1, has nanogram sensitivity, and detects both active and zymogen enzyme forms, as well as collagenase-1 bound to tissue inhibitor of metalloproteases (TIMP) or bound to substrate. Results were obtained from triplicate determinations and were normalized to total cell protein as quantified by the BCA protein assay (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Postconfluent keratinocytes plated on type I collagen were cultured for 24 h in the presence of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/fetal calf serum containing control or experimental solutions. The culture wells were then washed and replaced with methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% dialyzed fetal calf serum (to remove free amino acids), 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mml-glutamine, 0.1 mm each of nonessential amino acids, 50 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (ICN Radiochemicals, Irvine CA), and the identical concentrations of experimental reagents.

Samples were precleared with protein A-Sepharose (Zymed, San Francisco, CA), and supernatants were incubated with antibody for 1 h at 37 °C and then overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose and washed extensively. Radiolabeled proteins were resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by fluorography. Total incorporated radioactivity was determined from the same conditioned medium by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. Total RNA was isolated from cultured keratinocytes by phenol-chloroform extraction (38Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63019) Google Scholar). RNA (5 μg) was denatured and resolved by electrophoresis through a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel, transferred overnight to Hybond N+ (Amersham Corp.), and hybridized with radiolabeled collagenase-1 (39Goldberg G.I.

The cDNA probes were labeled by random priming (Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany) with [α-32P]dCTP (NEN Life Science Products). Following hybridization, the membranes were washed and exposed to x-ray film for an appropriate duration. To determine which FGFRs were expressed by both human keratinocytes and fibroblasts, total RNA was harvested as above. RNA was treated with RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega, Madison, WI) to remove any contaminating DNA as described (40Swee M.H. Parks W.C. Pierce R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14899-14906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). DNase-treated RNA (5 μg) was reverse transcribed with random hexamers using kit reagents and under the manufacturer's recommended conditions (GeneAmp RNA PCR kit, Perkin-Elmer, Norwalk, CT). For each sample, a parallel reaction was run without reverse transcriptase as a control. Expression of FGFRs 1–4 in human keratinocytes was detected by polymerase chain amplification of cDNA using a single primer pair to amplify conserved sequences in the tyrosine kinase domain of all FGFRs (41McEwen D.G. Ornitz D.M. Biotechniques. 1997; 22: 1068-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The primer sequences used for PCR were DO156 (5′-TCNGAGATGGGAGRTGATGAA-3′) and DO158 (5′-CCAAGTCHGCDATCCTTCAT-3′), which produce a 341-bp product. PCR was for 30 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min, followed by a final extension step of 72 °C for 7 min. To determine which members of the FGFR family were expressed, PCR products were analyzed by restriction digestion analysis with PstI, BalI,ScaI, or NarI. Digested fragments were separated by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by silver staining. To determine the expression of FGFR-2 isoforms (IIIb and IIIc) by human keratinocytes and fibroblasts, we amplified random primed cDNA with specific primers as described (42Pekonen F. Nyman T. Rutanen E.-M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 95: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cDNA was amplified for FGFR-2 IIIb using the 5′S primer corresponding to a region within the FGFR-2 IIIb-specific exon K: 5′-CAATGCAGAAGTGCTGGCTCTGTTCAA-3′. FGFR-2 IIIc was amplified using the 5′S primer corresponding to a region within the FGFR-2 IIIc specific exon B: 5′-GTTAACACCACGGACAA-3′. The 3′AS primer used in both PCR reactions was from nucleotides 2093–2112 of the cDNA coding for FGFR-2 IIIb. The same 3′AS primer was used for amplification of both FGFRs, since the nucleotide sequence is identical for both isoforms in this region (27Miki T. Bottaro D.P. Fleming T.P. Smith C.L. Burgess W.H.

PCR was for 40 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min, followed by a final extension step of 72 °C for 7 min. The predicted fragment size was 822 bp for the FGFR-2 IIIb and 830 for FGFR-2 IIIc. The products were separated through a 2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Further specificity was determined by transfer to Hybond N+ followed by Southern hybridization with a radiolabeled product-specific oligonucleotide probe. The probe was labeled by terminal transferase (Boehringer Mannheim) with [α-32P]dCTP. Following hybridization, the membranes were washed and exposed to x-ray film for an appropriate duration. To determine the expression of FGFR-3 isoforms (IIIb and IIIc) by human keratinocytes and fibroblasts, we amplified random primed cDNA with specific primers as described (45Scotet E. Houssaint E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1264: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The 5′S primer used (5′-GCACCGGCCCCATCCTGCAGGCGG-3′) corresponds to nucleotides 789–811 of the human FGFR-3 gene, and the 3′AS primer used (5′-TACACACTGCCCGCCTCGTCAGC-3′) corresponds to nucleotides 1135–1158 of the FGFR-3 gene, generating a product with a predicted size of 369 bp. PCR was for 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 68 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min followed by a final extension step of 72 °C for 7 min. Following amplification, products were analyzed by restriction digestion analysis with HaeII andTaqI, allowing subsequent identification of IIIb and IIIc isoforms. Products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred to Hybond N+, and hybridized with a radiolabeled product-specific oligonucleotide probe. The probe was labeled by terminal transferase with α [32P]dCTP. Following hybridization, the membranes were washed and exposed to x-ray film for an appropriate duration. Previous reports have documented the capacity of bFGF to stimulate collagenase-1 production in cells of mesenchymal origin (18Sasaki T. J. Dermatol. 1992; 19: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 19Okamura K. Sato Y. Matsuda T. Hamanaka R. Ono M. Kohno K. Kuwano M. J Biol.

Consistent with these studies, we found that bFGF increased collagenase-1 production by human dermal fibroblasts in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.1 A). At 1.0 ng/ml bFGF, collagenase-1 production was augmented 5-fold over control levels. To assess if bFGF modulates keratinocyte collagenase-1 production, cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of growth factor for 72 h, and collagenase-1 accumulation in the medium was quantified by ELISA. In contrast to other cell types, bFGF potently inhibited keratinocyte collagenase-1 expression, with an ED50 of ∼1.0 ng/ml (Fig. 1 B). Preincubation with anti-bFGF neutralizing antiserum abolished collagenase-1 down-regulation (Fig. 1 C), thus demonstrating that the effect was due to the growth factor itself and not to a contaminant. Metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that bFGF inhibited keratinocyte collagenase-1 production at the level of new enzyme synthesis (Fig. 2 A). Immunoprecipitation of the same conditioned media for stromelysin-1 showed similarly reduced expression of this MMP (Fig. 2 B), whereas the synthesis of 92-kDa gelatinase and TIMP-1 was unchanged (data not shown). Inhibition of collagenase-1 and stromelysin-1 expression was specific, since synthesis of total secreted proteins by keratinocytes increased slightly following bFGF treatment (TableI). The disparity in bFGF concentrations required to effectively inhibit keratinocyte collagenase-1 production in Figs. 1and 2 reflect the individual skin donors examined, whom we have found to exhibit variable sensitivities to the growth factor.Table ITotal protein synthesisConditionProtein synthesis1-aValues for protein synthesis are in trichloracetic acid-precipitable counts/min.Control12,258 ± 1068bFGF (1.0 ng/ml)13,279 ± 2167bFGF (25 ng/ml)16,622 ± 956KGF (1.0 ng/ml)16,220 ± 3723KGF (10 ng/ml)15,237 ± 676The same labeled cellular proteins used for immunoprecipitation of collagenase-1 (Fig. 2 and 4B) were instead precipitated with 20% trichloroacetic acid as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data presented are the means ± S.D. of triplicate determinations from three separate wells per treatment.1-a Values for protein synthesis are in trichloracetic acid-precipitable counts/min.

Total RNA was isolated from keratinocytes that had been treated for 24 h in the absence or presence of bFGF (25 ng/ml) and was analyzed by Northern hybridization. bFGF inhibited steady-state collagenase-1 mRNA levels, causing a 68% reduction when compared with untreated controls (Fig.3 A). Identically treated cells were cultured for 48 h, and collagenase-1 protein was quantified by ELISA (Fig.3 B). bFGF inhibited collagenase-1 protein expression (57%) proportionally to the drop in mRNA levels (68%), indicating pretranslational regulation. Although bFGF consistently inhibited keratinocyte collagenase-1 expression, we often had to use relatively high concentrations (≥10 ng/ml) of the growth factor to observe this activity (Fig. 2 and other data not shown). Because multiple FGFs bind to more than one FGFR with different affinities (48Partanen J. Makela T.P. Eerola E. Korhonen J. Hirvonen H. Claesson-Welsh L. Alitalo K.

KGF, a mesenchymal cell-derived cytokine that acts specifically on epithelial cells (24Rubin J.S. Osada H.-J. Finch P.W. Taylor W.G. Rudikoff S. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 802-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar), was chosen as a candidate because of its relevance to epidermal wound repair. Paralleling the effects of bFGF, treatment of cultured keratinocytes with increasing concentrations of KGF resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of collagenase-1 expression (Fig. 4 A). Futhermore, KGF was more potent, consistently demonstrating an ED50 of ∼0.01 ng/ml, at least 100-fold lower than bFGF. As demonstrated by metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation, KGF inhibited collagenase-1 production (Fig. 4 B). Again, KGF was effective at lower concentrations than bFGF (Fig. 4 A versusFig. 1 B). As observed for bFGF, stromelysin-1 biosynthesis was also inhibited by KGF treatment, whereas 92-kDa gelatinase and TIMP-1 were unaffected (data not shown). Total protein synthesis was mildly increased by KGF (Table I), indicating the specificity of its collagenase-related activity. Northern hybridization was performed to determine if KGF inhibited collagenase-1 production in a manner similar to bFGF. Keratinocytes treated with KGF (1.0 ng/ml) displayed a dramatic reduction in collagenase-1 mRNA compared with untreated cells (Fig. 5 A). To compare KGF inhibition of collagenase-1 mRNA with collagenase-1 protein, conditioned media samples from the same skin donor were analyzed by ELISA. Quantitation demonstrated that inhibition of secreted collagenase-1 protein closely paralleled decreased mRNA levels (Fig. 5 B; 69versus 70%, respectively). FGFs activate a fa"

Although microinjection of the purified protein in early studies made its use technically challenging, the dynamic range of aequorin has always recommended it for studies of physiological transitions in [Ca2+] i (1Cobbold P.H. Rink T.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 313-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The cloning of one of the members of this family of proteins made it possible to transiently transfect cells with cDNAs encoding aequorin and thereby circumvent the need for microinjection (2Inouye S.

Recently, aequorin has been creatively applied to the measurement of Ca2+ in discrete cellular subdomains, such as the near mitochondrial membrane (4Rizzuto R. Simpson A.W. Brini M. Pozzan T.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5467-5475Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), by creating chimeras of targeting sequences of intracellular organelle marker proteins with aequorin. This offers a clear advantage of selective measurement of [Ca2+] i in various subcellular domains over the current alternative of fluorescent dyes that are distributed uniformly in the cytosol.Ca2+-sensitive adenylyl cyclases (even when transfected heterologously) are directly regulated by changes in [Ca2+] i (9Cooper D.M.F. Mons N. Karpen J.W. Nature. 1995; 374: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 10Mons N. Cooper D.M.F. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 536-542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The regulation by Ca2+ is due predominantly to capacitative Ca2+entry; Ca2+ released from internal stores or nonspecific entry of Ca2+ via ionophore is unable to regulate Ca2+-sensitive adenylyl cyclases (11Chiono M. Mahey R. Tate G. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1149-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 12Fagan K.A. Mahey R. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12438-12444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). However, somewhat paradoxical is the fact that measurements of global cytosolic [Ca2+] i, using the fluorescent Ca2+-indicator fura-2, reveal that Ca2+released from internal stores or nonspecific entry of Ca2+via ionophore reports far higher levels of [Ca2+] i than are achieved by capacitative Ca2+ entry (11Chiono M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 12438-12444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Such findings have led us to propose that Ca2+-sensitive adenylyl cyclases may be in close proximity to capacitative channels and that the actual [Ca2+] i that the enzyme encounters may be significantly different from cytosolic [Ca2+] (12Fagan K.A. Mahey R. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12438-12444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Therefore, in the present study, we have constructed a full-length chimera of aequorin and the Ca2+-inhibitable type VI adenylyl cyclase (ACVI) with the purpose of measuring [Ca2+] i, under a variety of physiological conditions, in the microdomain in which Ca2+-sensitive adenylyl cyclases reside.RESULTSThe design chosen for the adenylyl cyclase/aequorin chimera was to place aequorin, linked at the N terminus with the HA1-epitope, downstream of the murine ACVI. It seemed that the adenylyl cyclase might tolerate the inclusion of a large addition at the C-terminal, since the Drosophila ACI homolog carries a substantial C-terminal addition with no deleterious consequence for its activity (27Levin L.R. Han P.L. Hwang P.M. Feinstein P.G. Davis R.L. Reed R.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 479-491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). In addition, substitution at the N terminus of aequorin does not affect its activity, whereas substitution at the C terminus eliminates Ca2+ binding (28Nomura M. Inouye S. Ohmiya Y. Tsuji F.I. FEBS Lett. 1991; 295: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The strategy used to construct the full-length ACVI-aequorin chimera was first to adopt a two-stage PCR protocol to ligate the 3′ 356 base pairs of the ACVI (13Yoshimura M. Cooper D.M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6716-6720Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) upstream of, and in frame with, HA1-aequorin (25Brini M. Marsault R. Bastianutto C. Alvarez J. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9896-9903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). This initial construct could then be readily ligated to the major 5′ component of the ACVI cDNA. After confirming the desired sequence of the cloned PCR fusion product, the partial cyclase/aequorin chimera was religated to the remainder of the ACVI cDNA (Fig. 1), and the full-length ACVI/AEQ cDNA was expressed in HEK 293 cells.Since the chimera included the full coding sequence of an adenylyl cyclase, it was possible to determine whether a functional adenylyl cyclase activity was expressed and to evaluate the subcellular localization of any such activity. Thus, vector alone (control), ACVI, and ACVI/AEQ were transfected into HEK 293 cells. Cells were lysed and fractionated on a continuous sucrose gradient (Fig. 2), and adenylyl cyclase and marker enzyme activities were assessed. Both wild type- and ACVI/AEQ-transfected cells showed exactly the same sedimentation profile as control-transfected cells, although the adenylyl cyclase-transfected cells had 3-fold higher activities than control-transfected cells (Fig. 2). Adenylyl cyclase activity sedimented with 5′-nucleotidase activity (an enzyme known to reside at the plasma membrane) and at a lighter density than the mitochondrial fraction (indicated by cytochrome c oxidase activity), which supports its appropriate plasma membrane localization.The foregoing biochemical fractionation data indicate appropriate subcellular localization of the adenylyl cyclase chimera by gross criteria and apparently unchanged overall activity. 2Immunohistochemical experiments using a pan-cyclase antibody directed against the C terminus indicated that approximately 25% of HEK 293 cells transfected with either wild type or chimeric ACVI cDNA showed strong immunoreactivity at the cell periphery consistent with plasma membrane labeling (N. Mons and D. M. F. Cooper, unpublished observations). The next series of experiments asked whether the full functional properties associated with ACVI were retained in the chimera. ACVI is an adenylyl cyclase that is inhibited by [Ca2+] in the submicromolar range in vitroand inhibited strictly by capacitative Ca2+ entry in vivo (11Chiono M. Mahey R. Tate G. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1149-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 12Fagan K.A. Mahey R. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol.

The fractions corresponding to the peak adenylyl cyclase activity from sucrose gradients (viz. 32–44% sucrose; see Fig. 2) were pooled and sedimented, and their response to a range of EGTA-buffered Ca2+ concentrations was evaluated. When the adenylyl cyclase activity in plasma membranes from either the ACVI- or the ACVI/AEQ-transfected HEK 293 cells are compared, it is clear that a significant (approximately 3-fold) increment in activity is obtained over that of cells transfected with vector alone (Fig. 3 A). Strikingly, the chimeric adenylyl cyclase shows exactly the same concentration dependence for inhibition by Ca2+ as the unmodified ACVI. Maximal inhibition of approximately 40% is observed at 1 μm Ca2+. As an internal control for the free [Ca2+] established in this assay, cerebral cortical membrane adenylyl cyclase activity was assayed and yielded a stimulatory response over the same range of free [Ca2+], in keeping with the predominance of Ca2+-stimulated isoforms of adenylyl cyclase in this tissue (9Cooper D.M.F.

Membrane preparations of mouse cerebral cortex, which express predominantly Ca2+/calmodulin-stimulable adenylyl cyclase activity were assayed in the same conditions, with the addition of calmodulin (1 μm; ▵), to corroborate the specificity of the effects produced by submicromolar [Ca2+] on these two forms of adenylyl cyclase. Data are means ± S.E. of triplicate determinations from an experiment that was repeated twice with similar results. B, effect of capacitative Ca2+ entry on the activity of expressed ACVI and ACVI/AEQ in HEK 293 cells. cAMP accumulation was measured in intact HEK 293 cells transiently expressing vector alone (○), ACVI (•), or ACVI/AEQ (▪) and plotted as a function (percentage) of the Ca2+-free condition. (Values are normalized from a control cAMP accumulation of 1.0, ACVI/AEQ activity was 1.5, and ACVI activity was 3.5 in the experiment shown.) Capacitative Ca2+ entry was evoked by emptying the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ stores with the sarco-/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin (100 nm) in a Ca2+-free Krebs medium. After 4 min, the indicated [Ca2+]ex were added to promote Ca2+ influx, and cAMP accumulation was measured over the subsequent minute. Assays were conducted in the presence of forskolin (10 μm) and prostaglandin E1 (20 μm), which stimulates adenylyl cyclase via the G-protein αs subunit. Data are means ± S.D. of triplicate determinations from an experiment that was repeated four times with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The critical biological hallmark of Ca2+-sensitive adenylyl cyclases, whether they are stimulated or inhibited by [Ca2+] i, is a strict dependence on capacitative Ca2+ entry for their regulation in vivo, rather than release from calcium stores or nonspecific cytosolic elevation of [Ca2+] i (9Cooper D.M.F.

Therefore, the most discriminating test of the appropriate cellular localization of the chimeric construct was whether it retained sensitivity to capacitative Ca2+ entry. Thus, the sensitivity to capacitative Ca2+ entry of the chimeric construct and the native ACVI was compared (Fig. 3 B). HEK 293 cells transfected with control vector, ACVI, or ACVI/AEQ were treated with the sarco-/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase inhibitor, thapsigargin, in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ to deplete inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive internal stores and to activate capacitative Ca2+ entry mechanisms. Such a regimen has been shown previously to generate robust capacitative Ca2+entry, which in turn regulates both endogenous and transfected Ca2+-sensitive adenylyl cyclases (11Chiono M. Mahey R. Tate G. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1149-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 12Fagan K.A. Mahey R. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12438-12444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). When a range of extracellular [Ca2+] were introduced to the bathing medium to initiate capacitative Ca2+ entry and the cAMP response measured, it was clear that both ACVI- and ACVI/AEQ-transfected cells showed the same (approximately 40%) maximal inhibition (Fig. 3 B). In the presence of 4 mmCa2+, the activity of ACVI and ACVI/AEQ was reduced to 61 ± 7.9% and 58 ± 4%, respectively (Fig. 3 B). These values were not statistically different from each other but were quite clearly statistically different from controls, p< 0.005. These data then unequivocally establish the cellular disposition of the chimeric adenylyl cyclase and predict its probable ability to serve as a sensor of Ca2+ at the plasma membrane.The final series of experiments evaluated the ability of the adenylyl cyclase/aequorin chimera to measure [Ca2+], both in vitro and in vivo compared with cytAEQ. An in vitro calibration curve of cytAEQ and ACVI/AEQ luminescence was fitted to EGTA-determined free [Ca2+] (Fig.4). After a crude separation of cell lysate from the cell membrane fraction for use in the in vitro calibration assay, 89% of the cytAEQ luminescence activity was in the cell lysate, while 89% of the ACVI/AEQ luminescence activity was in the cell membrane fraction. The results shown in Fig. 4 demonstrate that the aequorin portion of the ACVI/AEQ chimera is active and can measure a range of [Ca2+]free in vitro. The relationship between [Ca2+] and log(L/L max) for ACVI/AEQ was not significantly different from that of cytAEQ. Together, these data indicate that fusing the type VI adenylyl cyclase to the N terminus of aequorin does not significantly alter its Ca2+-sensing activity. Nonlinear curve fitting of the untransformed data yielded macroscopic K d values of 1.71 × 10−5m and 1.78 × 10−5m and Hill coefficients of 2.38 and 2.45 for cytAEQ and ACVI/AEQ, respectively.Figure 4Measurement of [Ca2+] using the aequorin-mediated luminescence activity of ACVI/AEQ and cytAEQ. In vitro calibration of ACVI/AEQ and cytAEQ luminescence to EGTA-buffered [Ca2+] was performed. TheL/L max ratios were obtained by determining the immediate rate of light output (L, counts/s) upon mixing cell lysates from cytAEQ-expressing cells or cell membranes from ACVI/AEQ-expressing cells with known [Ca2+] and determining the total integrated number of counts in the sample (L max) upon exposure to saturating [Ca2+]. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of triplicate determinations from an experiment that was repeated twice with similar results. (The in vitro[Ca2+]/log(L/L max) relationships for ACVI/AEQ and cytAEQ were virtually identical in two separate experiments.)View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To investigate whether the plasma membrane-targeted ACVI/AEQ could report changes in [Ca2+] i in vivo, the luminescence of ACVI/AEQ and cytAEQ were evaluated in transfected HEK 293 cells under conditions of agonist-induced Ca2+-release from intracellular stores or capacitative Ca2+ entry (Fig.5). The addition of the muscarinic cholinergic agonist, carbachol, to a suspension of HEK 293 cells transfected with either the cytAEQ or the ACVI/AEQ in the absence of extracellular Ca2+produced a rapid rise (<3 s to peak) in aequorin luminescence, which was converted to [Ca2+] i (Fig. 5 A). Luminescence did not increase in response to carbachol in cells where the intracellular Ca2+ stores had been depleted by a pretreatment with 200 nm thapsigargin, which demonstrated that the aequorin-expressing cells were actually measuring increases in [Ca2+] i due to Ca2+ release (data not shown; these conditions mimic earlier treatments of these cells using fura-2 to measure [Ca2+] i; Ref. 12Fagan K.A. Mahey R. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12438-12444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Cells transfected with the cytosolically distributed cytAEQ reported a significantly larger peak in [Ca2+] i upon stimulation by 200 μm carbachol than cells expressing the plasma membrane-bound ACVI/AEQ: 2105 ± 364 nm versus 1160 ± 136 nm (n = 3), respectively (Fig. 5 A). The likely explanation for this difference is the disparate location of the two Ca2+sensors within the cell, since there was no difference in their ability to measure Ca2+ in vitro (Fig.4). 3It is important to note that these differences cannot reflect different degrees of expression of the two probes, since an L max value is measured for each determination to normalize differences in expression. Furthermore, expression of the cyclase chimera (or other Ca2+-sensitive adenylyl cyclases) does not affect global [Ca2+] i rises, as measured by fura-2 Ca2+ (data not shown). The plasma membrane-bound Ca2+-sensor (ACVI/AEQ) detects Ca2+, which is released from intracellular stores at a level that is considerably lower than the levels detected by the uniformly cytosolically distributed Ca2+-sensor (cytAEQ), presumably due to the reuptake into intracellular Ca2+ stores and the activation of Ca2+ extrusion mechanisms. If this explanation is correct, it would be predicted that the plasma membrane-bound ACVI/AEQ would detect higher [Ca2+] i during Ca2+ entry than the cytosolic aequorin. To evaluate this prediction, capacitative Ca2+ entry was activated in HEK 293 cells transfected with either the ACVI/AEQ or the cytAEQ by adding 4 mm Ca2+ to cells that had been pretreated with 100 nm thapsigargin for 10 min in nominally Ca2+-free buffer (Fig. 5 B). In support of the prediction, cells expressing the plasma membrane-bound ACVI/AEQ reported a rapid rise in [Ca2+] i, which was consistently higher than was detected by the cytosolically distributed cytAEQ: 1225 ± 117 nm versus 660 ± 61 nm (n = 5), respectively.Figure 5In vivo [Ca2+] i measurements with cytAEQ- and ACVI/AEQ-transfected HEK 293 cells. A, HEK 293 cells transfected with either cytAEQ or ACVI/AEQ were stimulated with carbachol (200 μm) in Ca2+-free buffer (supplemented with 0.2 mmEGTA) at the time indicated by the arrow, and the resulting luminescence was measured and converted to [Ca2+] i. The upper trace is the carbachol response in cytAEQ cells, and the lower trace is the carbachol response in ACVI/AEQ cells. The traces shown are the means of triplicate determinations from a representative experiment that was repeated on three separate days with similar results.B, HEK 293 cells transfected with either cytAEQ or ACVI/AEQ were pretreated with 100 nm thapsigargin for 10 min in Ca2+-free buffer to activate capacitative Ca2+channels. Prior to the start of the experiment, 0.2 mm EGTA was added, and capacitative Ca2+ entry was initiated by adding 4 mm Ca2+ at the times indicated by thearrows. The resulting luminescence was measured and converted to [Ca2+] i. The upper traceis the capacitative Ca2+ entry response in the ACVI/AEQ cells, and the lower trace is the capacitative Ca2+ entry response in the cytAEQ cells. The traces shown are the means of triplicate determinations from a representative experiment that was repeated on 5 separate days with similar results. All experiments were performed at 30 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONBy a wide variety of criteria, the presently described adenylyl cyclase/aequorin chimera is fully functional and retains the properties of both parent molecules. The adenylyl cyclase/aequorin is localized in the same cellular regions as native ACVI; the activities of the two forms of the enzyme and their sensitivity to Ca2+, bothin vitro and in vivo, are identical. Aequorin, whether free in the cytosol or tagged onto the C terminus of ACVI, has unaltered affinities and properties for responding to Ca2+and can measure [Ca2+] i. In the intact cell, the ACVI/AEQ reports lower concentrations of released Ca2+reaching the plasma membrane than does the cytosolically distributed cytAEQ. During capacitative Ca2+ entry, however, the ACVI/AEQ reports a much higher [Ca2+] i at the plasma membrane than is seen by the cytosolically distributed cytAEQ. This finding is quite compatible with the reuptake, buffering, and extrusion mechanisms that are expected to reduce the amount of released Ca2+ reaching microdomains within the plasma membrane and to reduce the amount of Ca2+ reaching the cytosol during Ca2+ influx. These data provide an explanation for the fact that capacitative influx preferentially regulates Ca2+-sensitive adenylyl cyclases rather than Ca2+ released from internal stores, although global increases in [Ca2+] i due to released Ca2+ are much greater (11Chiono M. Mahey R. Tate G. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1149-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 12Fagan K.A. Mahey R. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12438-12444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar).A wide variety of precise information can be anticipated from the application of this construct to a range of physiological situations. For instance, the dynamics of [Ca2+] i in the immediate environment of a Ca2+-sensitive adenylyl cyclase and how this relates to the regulation of the enzyme can be determined. This is impossible to do with a cytosolically distributed Ca2+ indicator. Along with the limitation of not being able to resolve Ca2+ dynamics within a microdomain, cytosolically distributed fluorescent EGTA derivatives such as fura-2 can reach intracellular concentrations of 20 μm and greater. At these concentrations, fluorescent Ca2+-indicators such as fura-2 can actually alter the true kinetics of the response by acting as a Ca2+ buffer (25Brini M. Marsault R. Bastianutto C. Alvarez J. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9896-9903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). However, the concentration of a recombinantly expressed protein would be considerably lower than 1 μm and would not be expected to contribute to the intracellular Ca2+ buffering capacity. In addition, the cyclase chimera can serve as a novel plasma membrane-embedded [Ca2+] i sensor, which, given the extreme dependence of Ca2+-sensitive cyclases on capacitative entry rather than release, could allow the monitoring of a very selective subpool of [Ca2+] i. The jellyfish protein aequorin with its co-factor, coelenterazine, has been used for over 3 decades to measure cytosolic calcium ([Ca2+] i) 1The abbreviations used are: [Ca2+] i, cytosolic calcium; HEK 293 cells, human embryonic kidney cells; ACVI, adenylyl cyclase type VI; ACVI/AEQ, adenylyl cyclase/aequorin chimera; cytAEQ, HA1-tagged aequorin; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. 1The abbreviations used are: [Ca2+] i, cytosolic calcium; HEK 293 cells, human embryonic kidney cells; ACVI, adenylyl cyclase type VI; ACVI/AEQ, adenylyl cyclase/aequorin chimera; cytAEQ, HA1-tagged aequorin; PCR, polymerase chain reaction.

Although microinjection of the purified protein in early studies made its use technically challenging, the dynamic range of aequorin has always recommended it for studies of physiological transitions in [Ca2+] i (1Cobbold P.H. Rink T.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 313-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar).

It has been suggested that activation of Syk is dependent on Lyn. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the phosphorylation and activation of several downstream effector molecules in parental DT40, DT40Syk− and DT40Lyn−B cells. The phosphorylation and activation of p90Rsk was ablated in Syk-deficient B cells but unaffected in Lyn-deficient B cells while the phosphorylation/activation of Ras GTPase activating protein (Ras GAP) and mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase required both Syk and Lyn. Thus, these data indicate that Syk can be activated in the absence of Lyn after BCR cross-linking and results in the activation of p90Rsk via a MAP kinase-independent pathway in DT40Lyn− cells. We also demonstrated that BCR mediates the activation of p70S6k. However, activation of p70S6k in DT40Syk− and DT40Lyn−cells was comparable with that observed in parental cells. Thus, either Syk or Lyn may be sufficient for activation of p70S6k, or activation of p70S6k occurs independently of both Syk and Lyn. The kinase activity of Syk was required for the phosphorylation/activation of each of these downstream effector molecules but only the phosphorylation of Ras GAP was affected in cells expressing a mutant of Syk in which tyrosines 525 and 526 were substituted to phenlyalanines.

Nukada T. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). DT40 cells deficient in Lyn and Syk (DT40Lyn− and DT40Syk−, respectively) were generated by gene interruption (26Takata M. Sabe H. Hata A. Inazu T. Homma Y. Nukada T. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). It was shown that BCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of PLC-γ2 was abolished in DT40Syk− cells, indicating Syk is required for this event. In contrast, the phosphorylation of PLC-γ2 was only modestly decreased, and the activation of PLC-γ2 was unaffected in DT40Lyn− cells (22Kurosaki T. Takata M. Yamanashi Y. Inazu T. Taniguchi T. Yamamoto T. Yamamura H. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1725-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 26Takata M. Sabe H. Hata A. Inazu T. Homma Y. Nukada T. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T.

In this study, we compared DT40Syk− and DT40Lyn− cells with parental DT40 cells to determine the requirements for Lyn and Syk for the activation of several downstream effectors of BCR-induced signaling, including Ras GTPase activating protein (Ras GAP) (27Yagura H. Oyaizu N. Pahwah S. Blood. 1993; 81: 1535-1539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Gold M.R. Crowley M.T. Martin G.A. McCormick F. DeFranco A.L. J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 7538-7543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the serine/threonine kinases, p90Rsk and p70S6k, involved in the regulation of ribosomal S6 protein that functions in the efficient translation of some proteins in mitogen-activated cells (30Kozma S.C.

Ras GAP regulates Ras by converting the active GTP bound form of Ras into the inactive GDP bound form and may also function as an effector of Ras (34Trahey M.T. Wong G. Halenbeck R. Rubinfeld B.

Marshall M.S. Scolnick E.M. Sigal I.S. Gibbs J.B. Nature. 1988; 335: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Activation of Ras can lead to activation of MAP kinases (ERK1 and ERK2), which in turn can lead to activation of p90Rsk. Alternatively, p90Rsk, as well as p70S6k, can be activated independently of MAP kinases (36Kalab P. Kubiak J.Z. Verlhac M.H. Colledge W.H. Maro B. Development. 1996; 122: 1957-1964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By comparing anti-Ig-induced responses in the parental and mutant DT40 cell lines, we dissected the multiple signal transduction pathways that lead to the activation of these downstream effectors. Together with previous results, our data indicate that in addition to activation of signal transduction pathways that include both Lyn and Syk and lead to activation, for example of MAP kinase, cross-linking of the BCR also results in activation of Syk that can occur independently of Lyn and that is sufficient for the activation of p90Rsk. We also demonstrated that p70S6k is activated in B cells following cross-linking of the BCR. Finally, either Lyn or Syk is sufficient for activation of p70S6k, or BCR-induced activation of p70S6k does not require Syk or Lyn. The chicken B cell line, DT40, was cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 1% chicken serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. DT40Lyn− and DT40Syk− cells were cultured in the same medium containing 2 mg/ml G418 (37Kinch M.S. Sanfridson A. Doyle C. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1729-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Wild type and mutants of Syk were cloned into the expression vector pApuro (38Lankester A.C. van Schijndel G.M.W. Fromme J. Cordell J.L. Van Lier R.A.W. Van Noesel C.J.M. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 2157-2162PubMed Google Scholar) and transfected into DT40Syk− cells by electroporation using a gene pulser apparatus (Bio-Rad) at 330 V, 250 microfarad, and selected in the presence of 0.5 μg/ml puromycin. Two independent transfectants of each mutant that expressed comparable amounts of Syk by immunoblotting were further selected by Southern blotting of genomic DNA (data not shown). All results are representative of at least three experiments using a minimum of two independent clones expressing wild type or each mutant form of Syk. For induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of Lyn, Syk, and Ras GAP, cells were stimulated with 10 μg/ml anti-chicken IgM mAb (M4) for 3 min. For activation of p90Rsk and p70S6k, cells in an exponential growth phase were serum starved for 8 and 12 h prior to stimulation, respectively. The indicated numbers of cells were stimulated with 10 μg/ml M4 anti-IgM monoclonal Ab or 100 nm phorbol ester (phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu), Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were quickly chilled on ice and pelleted by centrifugation immediately after stimulation. Cell pellets were lysed in 500 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (1 × PBS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/ml soy bean trypsin inhibitor, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% deoxycholate, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 100 mm sodium orthovanadate) for 15 min on ice. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min. Clarified cell lysates were normalized based on protein concentration as determined using the BCA® kit (Pierce), and equal amounts of protein were subjected to immunoprecipitation or immunoblotting for each lysate. For Ras GAP immunoprecipitation, the clarified cell lysates (equivalent to ∼1 × 108 cells) were precleared with normal rabbit Ig overnight at 4 °C before polyclonal anti-Ras GAP Ab (Transduction Laboratories, KY) was added. For Lyn, Syk, p90Rsk, and p70S6k immunoprecipitation, the post-nuclear extracts (equivalent to ∼5 × 107 cells) were incubated directly with polyclonal anti-Lyn Ab (a generous gift from Dr. J. Cambier, CO), anti-Syk Ab (a generous gift from Dr. J. Bolen, DNAX, CA), anti-p90Rsk, or anti-p70S6k (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA) at 4 °C overnight. Immune complexes were precipitated with 30 μl of protein A/G plus®-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for p90Rsk immunoprecipitation or protein A-agarose beads (Life Technologies, Inc.) for all other immunoprecipitations for an additional 3-h incubation at 4 °C. For anti-Lyn and anti-Syk immunoprecipitation, the beads were washed twice with lysis buffer followed by two washes with PBS. For anti-Ras GAP, p90Rsk, and p70S6k immunoprecipitation, the precipitates were washed 5 times with RIPA buffer without SDS (1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 158 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μg/ml soy bean trypsin inhibitor) followed by two washes with lysis buffer and then PBS. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling in Laemmli buffer containing 0.4% dithiothreitol and resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE. Proteins with molecular mass less than 45 kDa were run off gels to obtain better separation of the proteins of interest from the Ab or to obtain increased resolution when determining shifts in mobility. The proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and subjected to immunoblotting. The blots were blocked with TNB buffer (30 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 75 mm NaCl, 3% bovine serum albumin) overnight at 4 °C. Polyclonal anti-Syk, anti-p90Rsk, anti-p70S6k Ab, monoclonal anti-Ras GAP Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA), or monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine Ab (4G10) was added at the concentrations suggested by the manufacturers. For anti-Ras GAP and phosphotyrosine immunoblotting, the blots were further incubated with 15 μg/ml polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse Ab for 1 h at 4 °C, whereas in p90Rsk immunoblotting, the blots were incubated with 15 μg/ml polyclonal rabbit anti-goat Ab for 1 h at 4 °C. The blots were then incubated with 1 μCi/ml iodinated protein A for 45 min at room temperature followed by autoradiography. For immunoblotting of ERK1 and phosphorylated MAP kinase, cells were stimulated and lysed as described above. Cell lysates were normalized by BCA® kit (Pierce), and 100 μg of cell lysates (equivalent to ∼2 × 106 cells/lane) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The blots were blocked and blotted as described above using anti-ERK1 Ab (Transduction Laboratories, KY) or anti-phospho-MAP kinase Ab (New England Biolabs Inc., MA). The blots were developed as described above. Anti-Rsk immunoprecipitates were prepared as above and washed once with kinase buffer (30 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mg/ml protein kinase A inhibitor (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)). The immune complexes were resuspended in 12.5 μl of kinase buffer with 0.3 mg/ml S6 peptide (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 5 μCi of [γ32P]ATP (6000Ci/mmol), followed by incubation at 30 °C for 10 min. The reactions were terminated by adding 7.5 μl of 3 × Laemmli sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. Samples were resolved on an 18.5% polyacrylamide gel. Gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography followed by quantitation using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) and Image QuaNT software. Anti-p70S6k immunoprecipitates were prepared as described above and washed once with kinase buffer (50 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 30 μm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml protein kinase A inhibitor). The immune complexes were then resuspended in 12.5 μl of kinase buffer containing 0.3 mg/ml S6 peptide and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. The reactions were terminated by adding 7.5 μl of 3 × Laemmli buffer and boiled for 5 min. Samples were then resolved on an 18.5% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was then dried and subjected to autoradiography. The relationship between Lyn and Syk in BCR-mediated activation has not been clearly defined. In one study, anti-Ig-induced activation of PLC-γ, a direct substrate of Syk (39Sillman A.L. Monroe J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 270: 11806-11811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 40Law C.-L. Chandran K.A. Sidorenko S.P. Clark E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1305-1315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was unaffected in a Lyn-deficient cell line, DT40Lyn−, but abolished in a Syk-deficient cell line, DT40Syk− (26Takata M. Sabe H. Hata A. Inazu T. Homma Y. Nukada T. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). This result suggested that the anti-Ig-induced activation of PLC-γ required Syk activation but could occur in the absence of Lyn. However, it has also been suggested that activation of Syk is abolished in DT40Lyn− cells, suggesting that Lyn is required for activation of Syk (22Kurosaki T. Takata M. Yamanashi Y. Inazu T. Taniguchi T. Yamamoto T. Yamamura H. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1725-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In view of this paradox, we tested the hypothesis that Syk can be activated in the absence of Lyn by directly comparing BCR-mediated signaling in DT40Syk−, DT40Lyn−, and parental DT40 cells. Using an optimal concentration of anti-Ig Ab (10 μg/ml M4), we found that the anti-Ig-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of several species, including proteins with approximate molecular masses of 55 and 65 kDa, was defective in DT40Lyn− cells compared with parental DT40 cells (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, the anti-Ig-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of a different subset of phosphoproteins including species with molecular masses of 87, 100, and 110 kDa was defective in DT40 Syk− cells (Fig.1 A). We have observed these differences consistently in many independent experiments. Consistent with previous reports, the anti-Ig-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Lyn in DT40Syk− cells was comparable with that in parental cells (Fig. 1 B). Furthermore, we detected anti-Ig-induced tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1 C) and kinase activity (data not shown) of Syk in DT40Lyn− cells, albeit to a lesser extent, compared with parental DT40 cells (Fig. 1 C). Taken together with previous studies, these data indicate that although Lyn may be an upstream effector of Syk in BCR-mediated signaling, Syk can also clearly be phosphorylated via a Lyn-independent pathway in B cells. We then sought to establish whether the suboptimal phosphorylation of Syk in DT40Lyn− resulted in activation of Syk and to identify potential downstream effectors in addition to PLC-γ that could be activated via a Lyn-independent but Syk-dependent pathway. Although we have not yet identified the tyrosine phosphorylated proteins, pp87, pp100, and pp110, present in DT40Lyn− cells but absent in DT40Syk−cells, we have established that these protein species are neither the p85 or p110 subunits of PI3-kinase nor p120c-cbl (data not shown). Since it has been suggested that BCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation leads to activation of a series of serine/threonine kinases (29Tordai A. Franklin R.A. Patel H. Gardner A.M. Johnson G.L. Gelfand E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7538-7543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated whether the phosphorylation and activation of any serine/threonine phosphorylated proteins/kinases requires Syk but could occur in the absence of Lyn. One of the major serine/threonine kinases activated in B cells is p90Rsk (29Tordai A. Franklin R.A. Patel H. Gardner A.M. Johnson G.L. Gelfand E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7538-7543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). p90Rsk is one member of a serine/threonine kinase family that like the S6 kinase, p70S6k, regulates the phosphorylation and activity of ribosomal S6 protein and that is thought to be involved in translational control during the cell cycle (41Price D.J. Grove J.R. Calvo V. Avruch J. Bierer B.E. Science. 1992; 257: 973-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 42Edelmann H.M. Kuhne C. Petritsch C. Ballou L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 963-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Based on mobility shift assays (Fig.2 A) and in vitro kinase assays (Fig. 2, B and C), we found that ligation of surface Ig induced activation of p90Rsk in parental DT40 cells as well as DT40Lyn− cells. However, the anti-Ig-induced activation of p90Rsk was abolished in DT40Syk− cells, indicating that Syk is required for anti-Ig-induced activation of p90Rsk (Fig. 2,B and C). The failure to activate p90Rsk in anti-Ig-stimulated DT40Syk− cells was not due to an intrinsic defect in p90Rsk, since stimulation with phorbol ester (PDBu) resulted in similar activation of p90Rsk in DT40Syk−cells, as observed in DT40Lyn− cells or parental DT40 cells. Thus, these data provide additional evidence supporting the hypothesis that Syk can be functionally activated via a Lyn-independent pathway that is sufficient for activation of the pathway leading to the activation of p90Rsk. To date, two mitogen-induced S6 kinase families have been identified, the Rsk family (including p90Rsk) and p70/85 S6 kinases. It was shown that the members of these two families are regulated by different mechanisms (25Couture C. Baier G. Oetken C. Williams S. Telford D. Cardine A.M. Baier-Bitterlich G. Fischer S. Burn P. Altman A. Mustelin T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5249-5258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is well documented that cross-linking of BCR induces activation of p90Rsk (29Tordai A. Franklin R.A. Patel H. Gardner A.M. Johnson G.L. Gelfand E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7538-7543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but only CD38-induced activation of p70S6k in B cells has been reported (43Patel H.R. Terada N. Gelfand E.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 507-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 44Kitanaka A. Ito C. Nishigaki H. Campana D. Blood. 1996; 88: 590-598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We sought to determine whether p70S6k could also be activated by BCR-mediated signaling by comparing the mobility of p70S6k on SDS-PAGE and kinase activity of p70S6k in DT40 cells with that in DT40Syk− and DT40Lyn−cells. Cross-linking of surface Ig induced a shift in mobility of p70S6k on SDS-PAGE in parental DT40 cells (Fig. 3,bottom panel). Furthermore, the shift in mobility corrrelated with the activation of p70S6k kinase activity (Fig. 3,top panel). Interestingly, both anti-Ig and PDBu-induced activation of p70S6k were unaffected in DT40Syk− and DT40Lyn− cells compared with parental cells, indicating that either Lyn or Syk is sufficient for anti-Ig-induced activation of p70S6k or that neither kinase mediates the activation of the signal transduction pathway that leads to activation of p70S6k. We next compared the protein tyrosine kinases required for anti-Ig-induced activation of MAPK and Ras GAP since the Ras/Raf/Mek/MAPK pathway has been implicated in activation of p90Rsk in B cells (29Tordai A. Franklin R.A. Patel H. Gardner A.M. Johnson G.L. Gelfand E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7538-7543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We measured the anti-Ig-induced phosphorylation of MAPK in DT40Syk− and DT40Lyn− cells since activation of MAPK involves its phosphorylation on tyrosine and threonine residues. Interestingly, we observed that the anti-Ig-induced phosphorylation of MAPK, unlike p90Rsk, is abolished in both DT40Syk− and DT40Lyn− cells compared with parental cells (Fig.4 A). This result indicated that activation of MAPK depends on Syk and Lyn, and thus the BCR-induced activation of p90Rsk in the Lyn-deficient DT40 cells (Fig. 2) must be mediated by an MAPK-independent pathway. These data do not, however, exclude the possibility that MAPK can also mediate anti-Ig-induced activation of p90Rsk in parental DT40 cells. Overall, these data are consistent with previous reports that p90Rsk can be activated with or without activation of MAPK in Xenopus oocytes (36Kalab P. Kubiak J.Z. Verlhac M.H. Colledge W.H. Maro B. Development. 1996; 122: 1957-1964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We then examined the anti-Ig-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Ras GAP, which negatively regulates Ras by converting the GTP-bound Ras (the active form) into the GDP-bound Ras (the inactive form) (34Trahey M.T. Wong G. Halenbeck R. Rubinfeld B. Martin G.A. Ladner M. Long C.M. Crosier W.J. Watt K. Koths K. McCormick F. Science. 1988; 335: 1697-1699Crossref Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 35Vogel Dixon R.A.F.

It was previously shown that cross-linking of BCR induced the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of Ras GAP (27Yagura H. Oyaizu N. Pahwah S. Blood. 1993; 81: 1535-1539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Gold M.R. Crowley M.T. Martin G.A. McCormick F. DeFranco A.L. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 377-386PubMed Google Scholar). However, the upstream effectors of this event in B cells were not determined. We found that the anti-Ig-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Ras GAP is ablated in DT40Syk− and DT40Lyn− cells, suggesting again that both Syk and Lyn are required for this event (Fig.4 B). To map the structural elements required for the activation of Syk-dependent substrates, we transfected DT40Syk− cells with either wi"

However, the corresponding single Goα mutant protein (D273N) did not bind either xanthine nucleotides or guanine nucleotides. Interestingly, the introduction of a second mutation to generate the Goα subunit D273N/Q205L switched nucleotide binding specificity to xanthine nucleotide. The double mutant protein GoαD273N/Q205L (GoαX) bound xanthine triphosphate, but not guanine triphosphate. Recombinant GoαX (GoαD273N/Q205L) formed heterotrimers with βγ complexes only in the presence of xanthine diphosphate (XDP), and the binding to βγ was inhibited by xanthine triphosphate (XTP). Furthermore, as a result of binding to XTP, the GoαX protein underwent a conformational change similar to that of the activated wild-type Goα. In transfected COS-7 cells, we demonstrate that the interaction between GoαX and βγ occurred only when cell membranes were permeabilized to allow the uptake of xanthine diphosphate. This is the first example of a switch in nucleotide binding specificity from guanine to xanthine nucleotides in a heterotrimeric G protein α subunit.

This is the first example of a switch in nucleotide binding specificity from guanine to xanthine nucleotides in a heterotrimeric G protein α subunit. G proteins transduce receptor-generated signals across the plasma membranes of eukaryotic cells. They are heterotrimeric complexes composed of α, β, and γ subunits. Each of the subunits belongs to a multigene protein family, containing at least 18 distinct α, 5 β, and 11 γ subunits. Hundreds of seven-transmembrane receptors activated by a great variety of hormones, neuromediators, and growth factors are coupled to G proteins. Receptor-induced activation of a G protein leads to exchange of GDP for GTP bound to the α subunit. The GTP-bound α subunit is released from the αβγ trimeric complex, and both free α and βγ dimers are capable of modulating activities of effector enzymes and ion channels (1Neer E.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 249-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar, 2Simon M.I. Strathman M.P. Gautam N. Science. 1991; 252: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar, 3Gilman A.G. Annu Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4713) Google Scholar). G protein-mediated signaling is complicated; a single receptor can activate more than one kind of heterotrimer, and both the activated α and the βγ subunits can interact with multiple effectors. For example, the thrombin receptor is known to couple to G12, Gi, and Gq family members (4Grand R.J.A. Turnell A.S. Grabham P.W. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 353-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), and physiological responses may be the result of contributions by both α and βγ subunits. Furthermore, cross-talk between these different G protein-regulated pathways makes the networks even more complex. One way to analyze this complex network is to specifically activate a particular Gα in vivo to discern its function without interference from other G proteins. As a first step toward this goal, we used site-specific mutagenesis to switch the nucleotide specificity of Gα from guanine to xanthine nucleotides. In cells, xanothine monophosphate is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of GMP; however, the steady-state concentrations of XDP 1The abbreviations used are: XDP, xanthine diphosphate; XTP, xanthine triphosphate; DTT, dithiothreitol; NDK, nucleotide diphosphate kinase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PTX, pertussis toxin; PLCβ2, phospholipase C β2. and XTP are relatively low (5Henderson J.F. Paterson A.R.P. Nucleotide Metabolism. Academic Press, New York1973: 97-169Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, by subsequent introduction of XTP, we should be able to specifically activate the mutant protein. The α subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins belong to the GTPase superfamily that also includes factors involved in ribosomal protein synthesis, such as EF-Tu, and a large number of Ras-like small guanine nucleotide binding proteins (6Bourne H.R.

Both Gα structures had nearly identical binding pockets for the guanine nucleotide, which was similar to the guanine nucleotide binding pocket revealed in the crystal structures of Ras (12De Vos A.M.

One of the conserved features was the interaction between a specific Gα amino acid residue and the guanine nucleotide ring, i.e. a hydrogen bond from the side chain of a conserved aspartic acid (Asp-268 in transducin) to the N-1 nitrogen and the N2 amine of the guanine ring (see Fig.1 a). Asp-268 of transducin belongs to a conserved motif (NKXD) found in the GTPase superfamily. It has been shown that the characteristic hydrogen bond formed with the aspartic acid residue determines the specificity of guanine nucleotide binding in other GTP-binding proteins, such as EF-Tu and Ras (15Der C.J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 24046-24049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), leads to active proteins regulated by xanthine nucleotides instead of guanine nucleotides. In this report, we studied the effect of the similar D273N mutation on nucleotide binding specificity of Goα. Myristoylated recombinant mouse GoAα was expressed in Escherichia coli. Conditions for growth, induction, and lysis of the Goα-expressing cells were described previously (24Slepak V.Z. Wilkie T.M. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1414-1423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The D273N mutation was introduced in both wild-type Goα and the activated mutant GoαQ205L by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. The oligonucleotide TTTCTAAACAAGAAAAATTTATTTGGCGAGAAGATTAAGAAGTC was annealed to uracil-containing single-stranded DNA from the plasmids pGoα and pGoαQ205L. The resulting vectors were designated as pGoαD273N and pGoαX. We subcloned wild type and mutant Goα cDNAs into theE. coli expression vector pET-15b (Novagen), which added a peptide of 20 amino acids MGSS(H6)SSGLVPRGSH containing the His6 tag and a thrombin site upstream of the amino terminus of Goα. These clones were used to transform the E. coli strain BL21(DE3), and proteins were expressed. After harvesting the culture, cell extracts were resuspended in the binding buffer (5 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 160 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1 mm βMe). Binding to the Ni2+-NTA resin was according to the protocol provided by Novagen. The His6-tagged protein was eluted with a gradient of imidazole concentration (5–500 mm). The Goα and various mutant proteins eluted at about 250 mmimidazole. Proteins were then transferred to TED buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT) with 0.1 mm MgCl2 and 0.1 mm nucleotide diphosphate (GDP or XDP as appropriate) by gel filtration. Purified proteins were stored in 50% glycerol at −70 °C. XTPγS was synthesized from XDP and ATPγS with nucleotide diphosphate kinase (NDK) as described previously (25Goody R.S. Eckstein F. Schrimer H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 276: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To produce 35S-labeled XTPγS, the reaction contained 10 μm XDP, 1 μm[35S]ATPγS, and 10 units NDK (Sigma) in 100 μl of NDK buffer (1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 2 h. The resulting concentration of [35S]XTPγS was about 1 μm (1 μCi/pmol). The radiochemical purity of XTPγS was monitored by thin layer chromatography on Avicel/DEAE plates (Analtech) in 0.07 nHCl. Binding of [35S]GTPγS and [35S]XTPγS to the recombinant Goα and the mutant proteins was performed as described (24Slepak V.Z. Wilkie T.M. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1414-1423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding reaction contained 0.5 μg of purified protein or 200 μg of crude E. coli protein in TED buffer with 0.1 mmMgCl2, 1 μm ATP, and 0.1 μmGTPγS or XTPγS (20,000 cpm/pmol). For the time course experiments, 20-μl aliquots were withdrawn from a 200-μl reaction, diluted 10-fold with ice-cold TED buffer containing 0.1 mmMgCl2, filtered through a 0.45-μm nitrocellulose filter, washed, and dried. The amount of bound radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Approximately 0.1 μg of purified recombinant Goα was preincubated with nucleotide at room temperature for 30 min in the TED buffer. 10 ng of trypsin was then added to the mixture, and the reaction was terminated after 10 min by addition of an equal volume of 2 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer and heating for 3 min at 100 °C. The proteolytic pattern was subsequently analyzed by Western blot using antibodies against Goα. Pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation was performed as described (24Slepak V.Z. Wilkie T.M. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1414-1423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.1 μg of recombinant Goα was mixed with 0.1 μg of purified retinal βγ subunit complex in the presence of the appropriate nucleotide and incubated for 10 min at room temperature before addition of the reaction mixture (final concentration of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 0.5 μm [32P]NAD (20,000 cpm/pmol), and 10 μg/ml pertussis toxin (List Biologicals)). Reactions were incubated for 30 min at room temperature and terminated by the addition of 5 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were resolved on SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. 1 × 105 cells/well were seeded in 12-well plates 1 day before transfection. All transfection assays contained a total amount of 1 μg of DNA; the plasmid pCIS encoding β-galactosidase was used to maintain a constant amount of DNA. To each well, 1 μg of DNA was mixed with 5 μl of lipofectamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 0.5 ml of Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.), and five h later, 0.5 ml of 20% fetal calf serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was added to the cells. After 48 h, cells were assayed for inositol phosphate levels as described previously (26Wu D. Lee C.H. Rhee S.G. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1811-1817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Wu D. Katz A. Lee C.H. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25798-25802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transfected COS-7 cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in 200 μl of permeabilization solution consisting of 115 mmKCl, 15 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7, 1 mm EGTA, 100 μm ATP, 0.37 mm CaCl2 (to give a free Ca2+ concentration of 100 nm), and 200 units/ml α-toxin with or without 0.1 mm XDP for 10 min at 37 °C. Then 2 μl of 1 m LiCl was added before the inositol phosphate assay. To change the binding specificity of Goα from guanine nucleotides to xanthine nucleotides, we replaced Asp-273 by an asparagine residue, which was expected on the basis of structural analysis to coordinate with xanthine instead of guanine (Fig.1 b). This mutation was introduced into both the wild-type Goα subunit and the GTPase-deficient Goα mutant (Q205L). We chose Goα because myristoylated Goα can be expressed inE. coli, and it has been shown that many of the characteristics of the recombinant Goα protein are similar to those of the protein isolated from brain. To further characterize the function of XTP-bound Goα mutants, we purified these proteins in the form of non-myristoylated His6-tagged Goα by affinity chromatography on a Ni2+-NTA column. It has been shown that the non-myristoylated form of Goα has identical nucleotide binding properties compared with the myristoylated form, and it also forms trimeric complexes with βγ subunits although the affinity to βγ is much less than the myristoylated form (44Denker B.M. Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6272-6277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The nucleotide binding of Goα, GoαD273N, and GoαX (GoαD273N/Q205L) was assayed with [35S]GTPγS and [35S]XTPγS. In E. coli crude extracts, Goα reached maximum binding of GTPγS in about 30 min (Fig. 2 a). As expected, Goα showed no affinity for XTPγS. However, GoαX revealed a switch in nucleotide specificity. As shown in Fig. 2 b, GoαX had high affinity for XTPγS but not for GTPγS. Interestingly, only the double mutant was active while GoαD273N did not bind either GTPγS or XTPγS (data not shown). Goα binds GTPγS very tightly in the presence of 1 μm Mg2+ (28Higashijima T. Ferguson K.M. Sternweis P.C. Smigel M.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 762-766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Higashijima T. Ferguson K.M. Sternweis P.C. Ross E.M. Smigel M.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 752-756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both Goα (Fig. 2 c) and GoαX (Fig. 2 d) did not exchange bound [35S]NTPγS when excess non-radioactive nucleotides were subsequently added. The purified His6-tagged proteins in general retained the properties of the untagged myristoylated α subunits. However, we detected some differences in nucleotide binding. His6-tagged Goα or GoαX bound GTPγS or XTPγS, respectively, but the binding was less stable than with the untagged myristoylated protein. In the case of His6-tagged Goα, the bound GTPγS could be exchanged after excess non-radioactive GTPγS was added (Fig. 2 c). Similar behavior was observed in the XTPγS binding of pure His6-tagged GoαX, which also showed distinct nucleotide exchange after non-radioactive XDP or XTP were added to the binding reaction (Fig. 2 d). The decrease in nucleotide affinity was apparently the result of the presence of the His6-tag. Although the nucleotide binding of His6-tagged proteins was less stable, the specificity of binding was clearly maintained, and the mutant bound the xanthine nucleotides rather than the guanine nucleotides. As expected, the purified single mutant GoαD273N did not show any nucleotide binding activity (data not shown). Guanine nucleotides protect G protein α subunits, including Goα, from complete proteolytic degradation (30Hurley J.B. Simon M.I. Teplow D.B. Robishaw J.D. Gilman A.G. Science. 1984; 226: 860-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 31Graziano M.P. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15475-15482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Denker B.M. Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6272-6277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pattern of fragments derived from partial tryptic digestion can be used as an indicator of the conformation of the protein. In the presence of GDP, Goα is hydrolyzed by trypsin resulting in two products, a stable 25-kDa and an unstable 17-kDa peptide. Binding of non-hydrolyzable analogs of GTP can induce an active conformation of the Goα subunit, which is resistant to proteolytic degradation, and protects a stable 37-kDa polypeptide from further degradation. In the case of the activated mutant GoαQ205L, GTP can also protect the remaining 37-kDa polypeptide from complete proteolytic digestion by trypsin because GoαQ205L lacks GTPase activity. Fig. 3 ashows that XTP protects GoαX from proteolysis by trypsin (lanes 4 and 5), whereas in the control experiment, GTPγS protected wild-type Goα (lane 8). This experiment indicates that GoαX binds XTP without hydrolyzing it. After binding to XTP, GoαX must have assumed a conformation similar to that of GTPγS-bound wild-type Goα. In this experiment, wild-type Goα needed only 1 μm GTPγS to prevent complete proteolysis. Similarly, GoαX was sufficiently protected in the presence of 1 μm XTP. It is noteworthy that GTPγS, but not GTP, was also able to protect GoαX from complete tryptic digestion although this protection required GTPγS concentrations above 100 μm (lanes 1, 2, and 3). Thus, GoαX has a much lower affinity for GTPγS than for XTP. We did not detect any of GTPγS binding activity of GoαX in our nucleotide binding assay because the highest concentrations of [35S]GTPγS used in the reaction were micromolar. Consistent with the results of the nucleotide binding experiments, the single mutant GoαD273N was not protected by any nucleotides including GTP, GTPγS, and XTP up to millimolar concentrations (data not shown). The interaction of Goα with the βγ complex can be assayed by ADP-ribosylation of the α subunit induced by pertussis toxin (PTX) because ADP-ribosylation requires the formation of the heterotrimeric complex (33Bokoch G.M. Katada T. Northup J.K. Hewlett E.L. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2072-2075Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Casey P.J. Graziano M.P. Gilman A.G. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 611-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Modification (by ADP-ribosylation) of recombinant Goα catalyzed by PTX is the same in the presence of GTP or GDP because of the GTPase activity of Goα. However, GTPγS strongly inhibits the modification since Goα cannot hydrolyze GTPγS. GTPγS binding thus promotes the dissociation of the trimeric αβγ complex and prevents the ADP-ribosylation of the Goα subunit. The activated GoαQ205L mutant lacks GTPase activity, and the effect of GTP on ADP-ribosylation is similar to that of GTPγS on the wild-type Goα. Therefore, PTX labeling can be used not only to examine βγ binding but also GTPase activity. Fig. 3 b shows that purified Goα was ADP-ribosylated by pertussis toxin (lane 7), and the labeling was strongly inhibited by GTPγS (lane 6). In contrast, GoαX was modified by pertussis toxin only in the presence of XDP (lane 4) but not with GDP (lane 5), and as expected, the reaction was strongly inhibited by XTP (lane 2), whereas GTP had no effect (lane 3). Therefore, only XDP-bound GoαX can form trimeric complexes with βγ, and binding of XTP induces dissociation of the trimeric complex. As a control, we did not detect any ADP-ribosylation of GoαX when GTPγS, GTP, or XTP alone was present (data not shown). Consistent with the results of trypsin digestion, this experiment indicated that XTP was not hydrolyzed by GoαX. The quantitation of [32P]ADP-ribose incorporation revealed that the labeling of GoαX was proportional to the amount of βγ used and reached a maximum at a GoαX:βγ ratio of 1:1, similar to wild-type Goα (data not shown). Interestingly, high concentrations (over 100 μm) of GTPγS also inhibited the ADP-ribosylation of GoαX (Fig.3 b, lane 1), offering further evidence that GoαX was able to bind GTPγS with low affinity. As expected, GoαD273N did not interact with βγ and was not modified by pertussis toxin in the presence of either GDP or XDP (data not shown). In transfected COS-7 cells, β1γ2 is able to activate PLCβ2, and the activation of PLCβ2 can be inhibited by cotransfection with Goα because of competition for βγ (35Slepak V.Z. Katz A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 270: 4037-4041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We cotransfected COS-7 cells with PLCβ2, β1, γ2, and GoαD273N or GoαX and found that both Goα mutants did not inhibit PLCβ2 activity, whereas wild-type Goα did. This experiment indicates that both mutants do not bind βγ in COS-7 cells and is consistent with the in vitro experiments on PTX-induced ADP-ribosylation. GoαX bound βγ only in the presence of XDP, and because XDP concentration is negligible inside the cell, the interaction did not occur. To deliver XDP into cells, we tried to permeabilize COS-7 cells by several methods including digitonin treatment, electroporation, and α-toxin (36Ahnert-Hilger G. Mach W. Fohr K.J. Gratzl M. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 31: 63-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We found that only α-toxin gave us consistent results and had no effect on the PLCβ2 activities stimulated by βγ. After incubating cells with α-toxin in the presence of XDP, we found that GoαX inhibited PLCβ2 activity, whereas GoαD273N was not affected by XDP (Fig.4). In the control experiments, we found that adding GDP or GTP to the permeabilization buffer had no effect on the PLCβ2 activity of cells transfected with the Goα mutants (data not shown). This experiment shows that the Goα mutants behave similarly in vitro and in cultured cells; GoαX binds βγ only when exogenous XDP is available. We engineered a mutant of Goα that switched nucleotide binding activity from guanine nucleotides to xanthine nucleotides. The mutation (D273N) was at a conserved residue of the NKXD motif that appears in all GTPase superfamily proteins. Crystal structures of transducin and Gi showed that this aspartic acid residue participated in hydrogen bonding to the guanine ring (Fig.1 a). The proposed interaction between the mutagenized Asn and the xanthine ring is shown in Fig. 1 b in which the hydrogen bond is “flipped” when compared with wild-type Gα. Similar single Asp→Asn mutations have been made in other GTP binding proteins, including EF-Tu (17Hwang Y.W. Miller D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13081-13085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Weijland A. Parmeggiani A. Science. 1993; 259: 1311-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), Ypt1 (19Jones S.

Science. 1995; 269: 1422-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), and E. coli adenylosuccinate synthetase (23Kang C. Sun N. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24046-24049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in active proteins regulated by xanthine nucleotides instead of guanine nucleotides. However, the similar D119N mutant of H-Ras induced transformation of NIH-3T3 cells with efficiency indistinguishable from wild-type H-Ras (16Feig A.L. Pan B.-T. Roberts T.M. Cooper G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4607-4611Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 37Zhong J.-M. Chen-Hwang M.-C. Hwang Y.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10002-10007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Although the mutant D119N Ras exhibited decreased affinity for GTP and increased affinity for XTP (by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude), the high intracellular concentration of GTP (millimolar) probably ensures that the protein is still bound to the guanine nucleotides in the cell. Interestingly, we found the corresponding D273N mutation in Goα did not result in binding of either GTPγS or XTPγS, whereas the D273N/Q205L double mutant, GoαX, switched nucleotide binding ability. When examining the crystal structure of transducin, it is not clear why the Gln→Leu mutation (position 200 in transducin α), which is at the opposite side of the nucleotide binding pocket from the Asp→Asn mutation (position 268 in transducin α), rescued the xanthine nucleotide binding of GoαD273N. It is interesting to note that GoαX binds GTPγS at concentrations higher than 100 μm. In our nucleotide binding experiments, we could not observe this binding because the affinity was weak, requiring concentrations higher than 1 μm [35S]GTPγS, which was the highest concentration that we could use. The P–S bond of the γ phosphate in GTPγS is longer than the P–O bond in GTP, which not only prevents nucleotide hydrolysis when binding to G protein α subunits, it also results in qualitatively different interactions and different affinities. In vitro experiments using limited trypsin digestion and PTX-induced ADP-ribosylation showed that GoαX retained the characteristic properties of wild-type Goα in the presence of XDP or XTP. In addition, our data confirm the assumption that diphosphate nucleotides are required for the interaction of G protein α subunits with βγ subunits. XTP-bound GoαX assumed a trypsin-resistant conformation similar to that of the activated wild-type Goα and stimulated βγ dissociation from the trimeric complex, suggesting that GoαX can be activated by XTP. In transfected COS-7 cells, PLCβ2 is activated by G protein βγ subunits, and the activity is inhibited when cotransfecting with Goα because of the competition for βγ. To study βγ binding of the mutant GoαX in vivo, we looked for inhibition of PLCβ2 activity as an indication of βγ binding. We found that GoαX did not affect βγ-stimulated PLCβ2 activity because of the absence of XDP. To turn on βγ binding, we used α-toxin to make cell membranes permeable to XDP, and indeed under these conditions, GoαX attenuated PLCβ2 activity. G protein-derived βγ subunits are shown to be able to bind many proteins other than Gα, and may be involved in many signal transduction pathways. We demonstrated that XDP can be delivered into cells and GoαX may be used as a βγ quencher that can make the cellular βγ pool unavailable to other βγ effectors. The ability to turn on and off βγ in vivo could be useful to better understand the physiological function of βγ. Goα is one of the G protein α subunits whose functions are not well understood although there is some evidence supporting a role in the regulation of calcium channels (38Kleuss C. Hescheler J. Ewel C. Rosenthal W. Schultz G. Wittig B. Nature. 1991; 353: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 39Taussig R. Sanchez S. Rifo M. Gilman A.G. Belardetti F.

Nature. 1996; 380: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar), it is difficult to differentiate the activities of Goα and βγ in some situations when activated receptors release both Goα and βγ subunits. This is one of the problems that the GoαX mutant might be used to address. The channel may be activated directly by adding XTP without releasing free βγ in cells that have been transfected with cDNA expressing the mutant protein. Cross-talk between the different G protein-mediated signaling pathways has been well demonstrated. Activating GoαX directly and instantly by XTP would avoid the interference of other pathways and help us to differentiate individual pathways. Introducing this mutation into other G protein α subunits may be used to study their functions as well. We thank members of the Simon laboratory for helpful discussions and Drs. Lorna Brundage and Tau-Mu Yi for comments on the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2081745781,"Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5 (eIF5) interacts in vitro with the 40 S initiation complex (40 S·AUG·Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP) to mediate the hydrolysis of ribosome-bound GTP. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, eIF5 is encoded by a single copy essential gene, TIF5, that encodes a protein of 45,346 daltons. To understand the function of eIF5in vivo, we constructed a conditional mutant yeast strain in which a functional but a rapidly degradable form of eIF5 fusion protein was synthesized from the repressible GAL promoter. Depletion of eIF5 from this mutant yeast strain resulted in inhibition of both cell growth and the rate of in vivo protein synthesis. Analysis of the polysome profiles of eIF5-depleted cells showed greatly diminished polysomes with simultaneous increase in free ribosomes. Furthermore, lysates of cells depleted of eIF5 were dependent on exogenously added yeast eIF5 for efficient translation of mRNAs in vitro. This is the first demonstration that the TIF5 gene encodes a protein involved in initiation of translation in eukaryotic cells. Additionally, we show that rat eIF5 can functionally substitute yeast eIF5 in translation of mRNAsin vitro as well as in complementing in vivo a genetic disruption in the chromosomal copy of TIF5. Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5 (eIF5) interacts in vitro with the 40 S initiation complex (40 S·AUG·Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP) to mediate the hydrolysis of ribosome-bound GTP. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, eIF5 is encoded by a single copy essential gene, TIF5, that encodes a protein of 45,346 daltons. To understand the function of eIF5in vivo, we constructed a conditional mutant yeast strain in which a functional but a rapidly degradable form of eIF5 fusion protein was synthesized from the repressible GAL promoter. Depletion of eIF5 from this mutant yeast strain resulted in inhibition of both cell growth and the rate of in vivo protein synthesis. Analysis of the polysome profiles of eIF5-depleted cells showed greatly diminished polysomes with simultaneous increase in free ribosomes. Furthermore, lysates of cells depleted of eIF5 were dependent on exogenously added yeast eIF5 for efficient translation of mRNAs in vitro. This is the first demonstration that the TIF5 gene encodes a protein involved in initiation of translation in eukaryotic cells. Additionally, we show that rat eIF5 can functionally substitute yeast eIF5 in translation of mRNAsin vitro as well as in complementing in vivo a genetic disruption in the chromosomal copy of TIF5. Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5 (eIF5), 1The abbreviations used are: eIF, eukaryotic translation initiation factor; 5-FOA, 5-fluoroorotic acid; Ub, ubiquitin; kb, kilobase pair(s). in conjunction with GTP and other initiation factors, plays an essential role in initiation of protein synthesis (for reviews, see Refs. 1Maitra U.

In vitro studies using purified initiation factors have shown that the overall initiation reaction proceeds with the initial binding of the initiator Met-tRNAf as the Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP ternary complex to a 40 S ribosomal subunit followed by the positioning of the 40 S preinitiation complex (40 S·eIF3·Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP) at the initiation AUG codon of the mRNA to form the 40 S initiation complex (40 S·eIF3·mRNA·Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP). The initiation factor eIF5 then interacts with the 40 S initiation complex to mediate the hydrolysis of ribosome-bound GTP. Hydrolysis of GTP causes the release of eIF2·GDP (and Pi) from the 40 S ribosomal initiation complex which is essential for the subsequent joining of the 60 S ribosomal subunit to the 40 S complex to form a functional 80 S initiation complex (80 S·mRNA·Met-tRNAf) that is active in peptidyl transfer (6Trachsel H.

The purified protein was shown to be essential for the joining of 60 S ribosomal subunits to the 40 S initiation complex to form the 80 S initiation complex (7Peterson D.T. Safer B. Merrick W.C. J.

In these initial studies the apparent molecular weight of the purified protein varied between 125,000 (10Merrick W.C. Kemper W.M. Anderson W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 5556-5562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 150,000–168,000 (11Schreier M.H. Erni B. Staehelin T. J. Mol.

In our laboratory, however, using an assay that measured directly the formation of an 80 S initiation complex by the joining of 60 S ribosomal subunits to a preformed AUG-dependent 40 S initiation complex, we purified eIF5 both from mammalian cells (15Raychaudhuri P.

Chem. 1993; 268: 5754-5762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified mammalian and yeast proteins were shown to be monomers that migrated on SDS gels with an apparent molecular weight of about 58,000 and 54,000, respectively (15Raychaudhuri P.

More recently, we have cloned and expressed the mammalian cDNA encoding functional eIF5 of calculatedM r = 48,926 (20Das K. Chevesich J. Maitra U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The S. cerevisiae gene encoding eIF5, designated TIF5, has also been characterized and shown to be a single copy essential gene that encodes a protein of 45,346 daltons (23Chakravarti D. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10524-10533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified mammalian protein has also been used to characterize in vitro the eIF5-mediated subunit joining reaction using AUG-dependent 40 S initiation complex as a substrate (8Raychaudhuri P. Chaudhuri A. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2140-2145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Chakrabarti A. Maitra U. J. Biol.

However, the involvement of either the 49-kDa mammalian eIF5 or the 45-kDa yeast protein in translation of natural mRNAs in vivo orin vitro has not yet been defined. This is relevant in view of previous observations (1Maitra U. Stringer E.A. Chaudhuri A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 51: 869-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 2Hershey J.W.B. Annu. Rev.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995: 31-69Google Scholar) that proteins, e.g. eIF5A (25Kang H.A. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3934-3940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), isolated on the basis of their ability to stimulate partial reactions in the initiation pathway, were later shown not to be involved in translation of mRNAs in vivo. In this paper, we have used the S. cerevisiae system to further characterize the function of eIF5 in protein synthesis in vivo. We have constructed a conditional eIF5 expression system in which functional eIF5 was expressed from a transcription unit consisting of a ubiquitin gene cassette which acts as a protein destabilizing genetic element fused to the NH2 terminus of the open reading frame of the yeast TIF5 gene under the transcriptional control of GAL10 promoter. Similar expression systems were previously used by Park et al. (26Park E.C. Finley D. Szostak J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1249-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and Kang and Hershey (25Kang H.A. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3934-3940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as an effective way to rapidly deplete yeast cells of protein of interest. The effect of depletion of eIF5 on cell growth as well as protein synthesis in vivo and in vitro were then analyzed. The results of these experiments show that eIF5 plays an essential role in translation of mRNAs in vivo and in vitro. Additionally, the rat cDNA encoding functional eIF5 was expressed in yeast cells lackingTIF5. We demonstrate that the rat protein can functionally substitute for the homologous yeast protein in vivo. Yeast strains were grown at 30 °C in either YPD medium (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) Bacto-peptone, and 2% (w/v) dextrose) or in YPGal medium where 2% (w/v) galactose (glucose-free) replaced dextrose as the carbon source. Where indicated, haploid yeast cells were also grown in either synthetic complete medium containing galactose as the sole carbon source, designated SGal media (2% galactose, 0.67% Bacto-yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 0.2% amino acid mixture) or in SD medium where 2% dextrose replaced galactose as the carbon source. Forin vivo [35S]methionine incorporation, the 0.2% amino acid mixture in either the SGal or the SD media did not contain methionine. These methionine-lacking media were designated SGal-Met and SD-Met, respectively. Yeast transformations and tetrad analysis were performed as described by Rose et al. (27Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics; A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Methods for plasmid and genomic DNA preparations, restriction enzyme digestion, DNA ligation, cloning, and bacterial transformation were according to standard protocols (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A 2.8-kb yeast genomic fragment containing the entire eIF5 gene (TIF5) (23Chakravarti D. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10524-10533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was separately cloned into theXhoI/HindIII sites of centromeric plasmids pRS316 (URA3-based) (29Siroski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and pRS315 (LEU2-based) (29Siroski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to yield pRS316-TIF5 and pRS315-TIF5, respectively. In these newly constructed plasmids the expression of yeast eIF5 is under the transcriptional control of its endogenous promoter present in the inserted 2.8-kb fragment. For expression of yeast and mammalian eIF5 under the control of galactose-inducible GAL1 promoter, we first isolated a 0.6-kb BamHI/EcoRI fragment containing GAL1-GAL10 promoter from plasmid pBM272 (30Johnston M. Davis R.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1440-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar), and cloned it at the same sites of pRS315 to generate a new recombinant vector, pTM100. For cloning of the yeast eIF5 open reading frame into pTM100 vector, two primers were synthesized bearing the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal ends of yeast eIF5 coding sequences (23Chakravarti D. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10524-10533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that were flanked by BamHI andEcoRI restriction sites: NH2 terminus, 5′-dGCGCGCGGATCCATGTCTATTAATATTTGTAG-3′; COOH terminus, 5′-dATCCGGAATTCCTATTCGTCGTCTTCTTC-3′. These primers were used in high fidelity-polymerase chain reaction using Pyrococcus DNA polymerase I (Stratagene) and the polymerase chain reaction product was digested with BamHI and EcoRI and cloned into the same sites of pGEM7Zf(+) vector to yield pGEM-TIF5. DNA sequencing of the eIF5 coding region in the recombinant plasmid indicated error-free DNA synthesis. The 1.218-kb TIF5 coding region was then excised from pGEM-TIF5 by digestion with BamHI andXbaI and cloned into the same sites of pTM100 vector to generate the new recombinant plasmid pTM100-TIF5. For expression of mammalian eIF5 under GAL1 promoter, the recombinant rat eIF5 expression plasmid, pETIF5 (20Das K. Chevesich J. Maitra U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3058-3062Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 22Chaudhuri J. Das K. Maitra U. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4794-4799Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), was digested withEcoRI, blunt-ended by treatment with klenow DNA polymerase in the presence of 4 dNTPs, and then cut with XbaI to generate the 1.34-kb fragment that contained the entire coding sequence of rat eIF5 cDNA, starting 42 base pairs upstream of the initiating ATG codon and 8 base pairs after the termination codon. This fragment was then cloned into the NotI (blunt-ended)/XbaI sites of pTM100 vector to yield the new recombinant plasmid pTM100-EIF5. We also constructed a plasmid for conditional expression of a rapidly-degradable form of yeast eIF5 fusion protein (see Fig. 1). For this purpose, the coding region of TIF5 was first fused in-frame to a lacI-flu segment present in the plasmid pGEM-flu (26Park E.C. Finley D. Szostak J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1249-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) as follows. The vector pGEM-TIF5 was digested withBamHI and SphI and the 1.235-kb BamHI (blunt-ended)/SphI fragment containing the entireTIF5 coding region was cloned into the PstI (blunt-ended)/SphI site of the vector pGEM-flu to yield pGEM-flu-TIF5. This new vector was then cut with BamHI andSphI and the resulting 1.34-kb lacI-flu-TIF5fragment was fused in-frame to the ubiquitin gene, UBI4 (26Park E.C. Finley D. Szostak J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1249-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) under the control of the GAL10 promoter as follows. The plasmid pUB23 which contains the UBI4 gene was cut withEcoRI and BamHI and the resultingEcoRI/BamHI fragment that encodes URA3 upstream activation sequence of the GAL promoter (UAS Gal)-ubiquitin (Ub)-X (whereX is the trinucleotide codon for arginine) was ligated with the BamHI/SphI fragment that encodes thelacI-flu-TIF5 gene derived from the pGEM-flu vector. The resulting EcoRI/SphI fragment was then cloned into the EcoRI/SphI site of the centromericHIS3 vector pSE362 (26Park E.C. Finley D. Szostak J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1249-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) to generate pUB-TIF5R (Fig. 1). Expression of yeast eIF5 from the GAL10 promoter in this plasmid initially generates a NH2-terminal ubiquitinylated eIF5 fusion protein, which is rapidly processed in yeast cells by a deubiquitination enzyme to yield free ubiquitin plus an eIF5 fusion protein having arginine (R) as the NH2-terminal amino acid (see Fig. 1). The haploid yeast strain TMY101 (see Table I), containing the chromosomal copy of the TIF5gene disrupted with TRP1 marker gene and harboring the plasmid pRS316-TIF5 that expresses yeast eIF5 from its own promoter, was constructed from the diploid strain W303(a/α) following the one-step gene disruption method of Rothstein (31Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (2033) Google Scholar) as described for a similar disruption procedure with URA3 gene by Chakravarti and Maitra (23Chakravarti D. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10524-10533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The newly generated diploid strain (tif5::TRP1/TIF5) was then transformed with plasmid pRS316-TIF5 and Ura+ transformants were selected. One of the transformants was then sporulated at 30 °C, and the resulting tetrads were dissected and spores were germinated on YPD plates followed by selection on SD-Trp-Ura plates. Only spores containing the tif5::TRP1 gene and harboring the plasmid, pRS316-TIF5 will germinate to yield Trp+Ura+ colonies. This haploid strain, named TMY101 (Table I), was the host strain used for all plasmid shuffling experiments described in this study. The genotype of theTIF5 loci on the chromosome and on the plasmid of TMY101 was confirmed by Southern blot analysis (23Chakravarti D. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10524-10533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using relevant DNA restriction fragments as probes. For construction of haploid yeast strains for conditional expression of ubiguitinated eIF5 fusion protein, the strain TMY101 was transformed with LEU2-plasmid pRS315-TIF5, and Trp+Ura+Leu+ transformants were selected on SD plates and replica-plated onto another SD plate which contained uracil and 5-FOA to promote the loss of the URA3plasmid, pRS316-TIF5. The yeast strain recovered from the 5-FOA plate, designated TMY203, has the disrupted chromosomal copy ofTIF5 but now harboring pRS315-TIF5 as the complementing plasmid. This strain was then transformed with pUB-TIF5R that contains the TIF5 gene fused to the ubiquitin gene cassette (see Fig.1). The resulting Leu+His+Ura+transformants were then selected and grown in SGal-His-Ura media to promote the loss of the LEU2-plasmid, pRS315-TIF5 by segregation. The newly generated yeast strain, which has the disrupted chromosomal copy of the TIF5 gene, but harboring only the plasmid, pUB-TIF5R, was selected on appropriate SGal media. This strain, designated TMY201R, expresses R-eIF5 fusion protein (arginine at the NH2 terminus of the mature protein (Fig. 1).Table IYeast strains usedStrainGenotypeRef. or sourceW303αMATαleu2–3,112 his3–11,15 ade2–1 trp1–1 ura3–1 can1–10031Rothstein R.J.

The cells were harvested and 3A 600 units of cells were resuspended in 100 ml of YPD medium supplemented with 0.4 mg/ml adenine sulfate and grown for about 10 h at 30 °C. Following addition of cycloheximide (50 μg/ml), cultures were rapidly chilled in an ice-water bath and centrifuged. The cells were washed twice with LHB buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 30 mm MgCl2, and 50 μg/ml cycloheximide). The washed cells were then suspended in 1.2 ml of the LHB buffer and lysed by vortexing with an equal volume of glass beads. After adding an additional 0.5 ml of the same buffer, the cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation first at 12,000 × g for 10 min, followed by recentrifugation at 17,600 × g for another 10 min. Equivalent amounts of A 260 absorbing material (approximately 10 A 260 units in 200 μl) were layered on 11 ml of 7–47% (w/v) sucrose gradients in either a low salt buffer (10 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.0, 12 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NH4Cl) or in a high salt buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 15 mm MgCl2, 800 mm KCl (32Sachs A.B.

The gradients were fractionated in an ISCO density gradient fractionator and the absorbance profile at 254 nm was analyzed in an ISCO UA-5 absorbance monitor. The strain TMY201R was grown in YPGal supplemented with adenine sulfate (0.4 mg/ml) overnight at 30 °C (A 600 ≈ 1.0). Cells were harvested and suspended in YPD medium containing adenine sulfate (0.4 mg/ml) such that the initial absorbance at 600 nm was about 0.03 and grown at 30 °C for about 18 h (about 2 generations in YPD medium) when growth was nearly completely arrested. Cells were then harvested and cell-free translation extracts were prepared and mRNA-dependent cell-free translation was performed using [35S]methionine as the labeled amino acid as described by Hussain and Leibowitz (33Hussain I. Leibowitz M.J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1986; 46: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Total RNA of S. cerevisiae was isolated as described by Rose et al.(27Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics; A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) while poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from total yeast RNA by chromatography on oligo(dT)-cellulose columns (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) using the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. Luciferase mRNA was purchased from Promega and capped at the 5′ end with vaccinia guanylylmethyltransferase as described (34Shuman S. Moss B. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 170-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The vaccinia enzyme was a kind gift of Dr. Stewart Shuman of Sloan-Kettering Cancer Institute, New York. Purified eIF5 from rabbit reticulocyte lysates as well as recombinant rat eIF5 were isolated as described (18Chevesich J. Chaudhuri J. Maitra U. J. Biol.

Yeast eIF5 was purified from S. cerevisiae strain BJ926, as described by Chakravarti et al. (19Chakravarti D. Maiti T. Maitra U. J . Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5754-5762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified yeast eIF5 preparation exhibited two polypeptide bands of 54 and 56 kDa upon SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Each of the two polypeptides was found to contain eIF5 activity and they were immunologically related to each other (19Chakravarti D. Maiti T. Maitra U. J . Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5754-5762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The preparation of specific rabbit antisera against purified rabbit and yeast eIF5 and their affinity purification were as described (17Ghosh S. Chevesich J. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5134-5140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Chakravarti D. Maiti T. Maitra U. J . Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5754-5762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The procedure used for preparation of yeast cell lysates for immunoblot analysis was adapted from that described by Sachs and Davis (35Sachs A.B. Davis R.W. Cell. 1989; 58: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). To understand the function of eIF5 in the yeastS. cerevisiae, we depleted yeast cells of endogenous eIF5 and measured the effects of such depletion on cell growth as well as protein synthesis in vivo and in vitro. We initially constructed a haploid yeast strain in which the chromosomal copy of the TIF5 gene was inactivated by disruption withTRP1 marker gene and the essential eIF5 function was provided by maintenance of a centromeric plasmid that contained the open reading frame of the TIF5 gene under the transcriptional control of the GAL1 promoter. This yeast strain, designated TMY201 (Table I), as expected, grew on YPGal plates but did not form detectable colonies on YPD plates (data not shown). To deplete yeast cells of eIF5, TMY201 cells were grown in galactose-containing medium to early exponential growth phase and then transferred to glucose medium to turn off transcription of theTIF5 gene from the GAL1 promoter and thus, in essence turning off synthesis of new eIF5 protein in cells. Surprisingly, we observed that under these conditions, cell growth continued normally for five to six generations before declining. Immunoblot analysis of cell lysates showed that while the level of eIF5 progressively decreased with time following transfer from galactose to glucose medium, a significant level of eIF5 was still detectable in cell lysates even after six generations of growth (data not shown). Presumably, the rate of degradation of pre-existing eIF5 protein was not rapid enough to deplete yeast cells of detectable levels of eIF5 within one or two generations. In view of the observation (9Chakrabarti A. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14039-14045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Ghosh S. Chevesich J. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5134-5140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that eIF5 acts catalytically in initiation of protein synthesis in vitro, the presence of very low levels of the protein in yeast cells may be sufficient to sustain slow cell growth for many generations even in the absence of new eIF5 synthesis. Furthermore, because depletion of eIF5 in TMY201 cells required several generations of growth under repressing conditions, we were concerned of the possibility that many secondary effects might be induced under these conditions that could complicate interpretation of results obtained with such eIF5-depleted cells. To further lower the cellular level of eIF5 and to ensure more rapid depletion of eIF5 from yeast cells following transfer to repressing conditions, we constructed a haploid yeast strain TMY201R as described under “Experimental Procedures” in which the chromosomal copy of the TIF5 gene was inactivated with TRP1 marker gene and the strain was kept viable by maintenance of theURA3-centromeric plasmid that harbors a conditional eIF5 expression system in which eIF5 was expressed from a genetic cassette designed to destabilize the eIF5 protein. In such a system, constructed by utilizing a strategy first used by Park et al. (26Park E.C. Finley D. Szostak J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1249-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and later by Kang and Hershey (25Kang H.A. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3934-3940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), eIF5 was expressed from a transcription unit consisting of a ubiquitin gene cassette (Ub-X-lacI-TIF5) which acts as a protein destabilizing element fused to the NH2 terminus of the open reading frame of the TIF5 gene under the transcriptional control ofGAL10 promoter (Fig. 1). The eIF5 fusion protein synthesized from this construct contains ubiquitin at the NH2 terminus followed by a 31-amino acid segment of the lacI repressor which acts as a recognition element for ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation by NH2-terminal recognition pathway (36Bachmair A.

The hERR differs from these classical nuclear hormone receptors in that (a) it has no known activating ligand, making it an “orphan receptor”; and (b) the intact protein as well as the isolated DBD bind as a monomer to a 5′-extended version of the estrogen/retinoid receptor half-site:TCAAGGTCA. 2S. A. Kliewer and R. M. Evans, unpublished results. Similar response elements are recognized by a number of key monomer-binding orphan receptors, including murine steroidogenic factor-1/embryonal long terminal repeat-binding protein (14Ikeda Y.

Science. 1991; 252: 848-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In particular, steroidogenic factor-1 recognizes CCAAGGTCA, is a major regulator of the expression of steroidogenic enzymes (19Parker K.L. Schimmer B.P. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1993; 4: 46-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and has been implicated in sex determination (20Ingraham H.A. Lala D.S. Ikeda Y. Luo X. Shen W.-H. Nachtigal M.W. Abbud R. Nilson J.H. Nilson J.H. Parker K.L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2302-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). hERR1 has recently been found to activate the expression of human lactoferrin in endometrium and mammary gland cell lines and hence must play a role in modulating immune responses and cell growth (21Yang N. Shigeta H. Shi H. Teng C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5795-5804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Although there is currently no structural data available on monomer-binding nuclear hormone receptors, several functional/mutagenesis studies have identified a carboxyl-terminal extension (CTE) of the zinc-finger modules as a second structural determinant that contributes to DNA binding. Studies of the hERR homolog, FTZ-F1, have identified a 30-residue CTE termed the FTZ-F1 box (residues after Glu-171 in hERR2), which contributes a factor of 1000 to the binding constant; this region is proposed to be responsible for binding the 5′-end base pairs in the FTZ-F1 response element (22Ueda H. Sun G.-C. Murata T. Hirose S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5667-5672Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In contrast, a shorter 12-amino acid CTE in the RXR termed the T box is helical and has been implicated in providing protein-protein interactions that stabilize the homodimer (12Lee M.S. Kliewer S.A. Provencal J. Wright P.E. Evans R.M. Science. 1993; 260: 1117-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 23Wilson T.E. Paulsen R.E. Padgett K.A. Milbrandt J. Science. 1992; 256: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a chimeric protein, generated between the zinc fingers of the RXR and a carboxyl-terminal element in nerve growth factor I-B called the A box, binds as a monomer to the nerve growth factor I-B response element (23Wilson T.E. Paulsen R.E. Padgett K.A. Milbrandt J. Science. 1992; 256: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Thus, while the CTE of the RXR is helical and contributes to the binding affinity via protein-protein interactions, the monomer-binding receptors have an as yet structurally uncharacterized CTE that provides additional binding affinity via protein-DNA interactions. The present NMR studies of the hERR2 DBD, which consists of the zinc-finger modules and the CTE, represent a first step toward defining the structural basis of these interactions. The hERR2 DBD (residues 96–194) was expressed in BL21 cells using the pGEX-2T vector (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), which produces an amino-terminal fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase. Unlabeled protein was expressed at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani broth by induction for 4 h with 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside once cells had reached A 600 ∼ 0.8. 15N-Labeled protein was obtained using a minimal medium at pH 7.2 containing 44 mm Na2HPO4, 22 mmKH2PO4, 9 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgSO4, 0.1 μm CaCl2, 0.02 μm FeCl3, 0.1 mmZnCl2, 1% glucose, 1 mg/liter thiamine, and 1 g/liter (15NH4)2SO4 (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories). Cells were pelleted and resuspended in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 250 mmKCl, 5 μm ZnCl2, 30 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Triton X-100. After one freeze-thaw cycle, cells were lysed by sonication. The high DTT concentration was necessary to recover the hERR2 fusion protein from the pellet since there was extensive protein cross-linking via disulfide bonds. The sonicate was cleared by centrifugation for 15 min at 15,000 × g. Glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Pharmacia) were added to the crude cell lysate along with 100 mm DTT and 100 μm ZnCl2. After a 1-h incubation at 5 °C, the fusion protein·glutathione-Sepharose complex was pelleted and washed three times with a phosphate-buffered saline solution containing 100 mm DTT and 1 mmZnCl2. The first wash was done with 0.8 m NaCl to remove DNA. The pelleted protein/beads were then resuspended in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmCaCl2, 100 mm DTT, and 100 μmZnCl2 containing 50 units/ml bovine thrombin (Sigma) and incubated at room temperature until all of the hERR2 DBD had been cleaved from the glutathioneS-transferase·glutathione-Sepharose complex, at which point the proteolysis reaction was quenched with 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The eluted protein was concentrated with an Amicon flow cell (YM-3) and purified by HPLC using a C18reverse-phase column (Vydac). After an initial wash with 27% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, protein was eluted with a 0.6%/min acetonitrile gradient. Fractions containing the hERR2 DBD were lyophilized and weighed. The yield of pure hERR2 (>97%) was 2 mg/l of culture for labeled protein and 10–15 mg/liter for unlabeled protein. Protein was homogeneous based upon SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, HPLC, and electrospray mass spectral analysis (calculated M r = 11,416; observedM r = 11,417). Mass spectral analysis of the15N-labeled hERR2 DBD indicated >97% incorporation of label. The electrospray mass spectrum of the native hERR2 DBD showed anM r of 11,547 as expected for hERR2 with two bound zinc atoms. To improve the level of expression of the hERR2 DBD in Escherichia coli and the stability of the protein in vitro, a C163A mutation that removes a non-coordinating sulfhydryl group and a number of silent mutations designed to favor the biased codon usage in E. coli were introduced into the gene for the hERR2 DBD. 3D. R. Casimiro, S. M. Holmbeck, and P. E. Wright, unpublished results. NdeI and BamHI sites flanking the DBD gene were also incorporated via polymerase chain reaction. The NdeI/BamHI hERR2 DBD fragment was cloned into pET24a behind a T7/lacO promoter (24Dubendorff J.W. Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219 (2nd Ed.): 45-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), and the expression plasmid was then introduced into a lysogenic E. coli strain (BL21(DE3)). Uniformly 15N-enriched protein sample was prepared using a minimal medium similar to that described above, except that the concentrations of glucose and (15NH4)2SO4 were 3 and 2 g/liter, respectively. 13C,15N-Labeled protein was obtained with a minimal medium in which [13C6]glucose (ISOTEC) was used. Gene expression was induced by adding isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at a cell density ofA 600 ∼ 1.0–1.2. 1 h after isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction, rifampicin was added to the culture to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml; the cells were incubated for another 5 h at 37 °C. The protein was isolated and purified to homogeneity (>95%) following a protocol similar to that used for the wild-type hERR2 DBD, with the exclusion of the glutathione-Sepharose chromatography step. The yield of purified DBD improved to 10 mg/liter of minimal medium. Gel-shift assays were carried out using32P-end-labeled oligonucleotides that represent the recognition site for hERR2, with two additional GC base pairs added on either end for stability (5′-GCTCAAGGTCACG-3′ and the complementary strand). Labeling and assays were performed using standard procedures (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The gel was 5% acrylamide (1:50 bisacrylamide) in 45 mm Tris borate. Incubations were carried out for 30 min at 25 °C in 6% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl, and 0.5 mmMgCl2, with DNA at <3.7 nm, hERR2 (wild-type and C163A) varied from 23 μm to 23 nm, and poly(dI·dC) at 0.1 μg/μl. The lyophilized hERR2 DBD samples were resuspended in 6 m urea containing 0.5 mmZnCl2 and 100 mm DTT and immediately passed over a PD-10 gel filtration column (Pharmacia) equilibrated with NMR buffer (20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.5–6.7), 100 mm KCl, 0.3 mm ZnCl2, and 5% D2O). After the addition of 10 mmDTT-d 10, the sample was concentrated with a Centricon 3 membrane to give a final hERR2 DBD concentration of 0.8–1.5 mm. All solvents used for sample preparation were purged with argon gas. Since the protein precipitated at pH <6.5, all NMR experiments were carried out at pH 6.5–6.7. All NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker DMX750, AMX600, and AMX500 spectrometers at 300 K. The 1H carrier was set on H2O/HOD in all experiments and shifted to the center of the amide region during acquisition in the HSQC experiments. Phase-sensitive detection was achieved using either time proportional phase incrementation (26Marion D. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 113: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (3524) Google Scholar) or TPPI-States (27Marion D. Driscoll P.C. Kay L.E. Wingfield P.T. Bax A. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M.

Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 6511-6513Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar) were recorded with 200-, 100-, and 50-ms mixing times. A NOESY spectrum with an 80-ms mixing time was also recorded in D2O.

Two-dimensional homonuclear data were recorded with 128–320 scans, 512t 1 increments, and 8192 data points/increment and at 500-MHz proton carrier frequency. A spectral width of 12,500 Hz was used in the F2 dimension, while spectral widths of 6250–7000 Hz were used in the F1 dimension (12,500 Hz in the double quantum experiment). Digital oversampling by a factor of 2 was used to reduce base-line distortion (37Delsuc M.A. Lallemand J.Y. J. Magn. Res. 1986; 69: 504-507Google Scholar). Two-dimensional {1H-15N} HSQC and NOESY-HSQC (100-ms mixing time) spectra were acquired using standard methods (38Bax A. Ikura M. Kay L.E. Torchia D.A. Tschudin R. J. Magn.

Soc. 1989; 111: 1515-1517Crossref Scopus (594) Google Scholar) data were recorded with mixing times of 100 and 150 ms, using 128t 1 (1H) increments, 32t 2 (15N) increments, and 16 free induction decays of 1024 data points/increment pair. Three-dimensional TOCSY-HSQC data were recorded in the same manner, with a spin-lock period of 40 ms. All multidimensional data were processed using either a modified version of the FTNMR software provided by Dr. Dennis Hare (Hare Research) or the Triad software package (Tripos Associates). Spectra were Fourier-transformed after applying a lorentzian-to-gaussian weighting function in the directly detected dimension and a shifted sine bell weighting function in the indirectly detected dimension(s). The water signal was removed from all spectra by applying a low pass filter to the time domain data (42Marion D. Ikura M. Bax A. J. Magn. Res. 1989; 84: 425-430Google Scholar). Three-dimensional constant-time HNCA and HNCOCA spectra were collected on the 13C,15N-labeled C163A hERR2 DBD following established methods (43Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Magn. Res. 1992; 96: 432-440Google Scholar); pulsed-field gradients were incorporated in these schemes for solvent suppression. These spectra were recorded at 600 MHz with 32 t 1 increments (15N carrier at 117.75 ppm, spectral width of 1429 Hz), 64t 2 increments (13C-α carrier at 54 ppm, spectral width of 4225 Hz), and 16 free induction decays of 1024 data points for the directly detected 1H resonances (carrier at 8.2 ppm, spectral width of 5434 Hz). Heteronuclear {1H-15N} steady-state NOEs for the C163A hERR2 DBD were also measured at 600 MHz using two-dimensional HSQC experiments (44Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 12593-12594Crossref Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). To minimize magnetization transfer from water to any rapidly exchanging amide protons, a 6-s relaxation/irradiation delay was employed between passes through the pulse sequence, and water was suppressed with flip-back and gradient pulses. The recombinant hERR2 DBD (residues 96–194) exhibited a high affinity for the 5′-extended half-site sequence, 5′-TCAAGGTCA-3′, in gel-shift assays.2Analysis of the holoprotein by pneumatically assisted electrospray spectrometry gave a molecular mass 130 ± 2 Da higher than that of the apoprotein, indicative of two tightly bound zinc ions/polypeptide (data not shown). These data are consistent with the prediction that hERR2 is a zinc-finger DNA-binding protein (3Giguere V. Yang N. Segui P. Evans R.M. Nature. 1988; 331: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). NMR studies were carried out on the recombinant DBD peptide, which contains the putative 66-amino acid (ZnCys4)2-type zinc-finger domain and the requisite 26-amino acid CTE for high affinity monomer binding to the extended half-site sequence (22Ueda H.

Biol. 1993; 13: 5794-5804Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). 87% of the backbone protons, 53% of the side-chain protons, and 86% of the backbone nitrogens have been assigned for Leu-102–Arg-174. Sequence-specific assignments were made using the NOE-based sequential assignment procedures (46Billeter M. Braun W. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 155: 321-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar) and are summarized in the two-dimensional {1H-15N} HSQC spectrum (Fig.1). Sequential d NN connectivities in two-dimensional NOESY and NOESY-HSQC spectra were used to connect most of the residues, with the help of two-dimensional TOCSY and COSY spectra to identify spin systems. The double quantum spectrum was especially helpful in resolving ambiguities in the assignment of side-chain protons and in assigning glycine CαH protons. Assignment ambiguities due to overlap could usually be resolved using the three-dimensional NOESY-HSQC and TOCSY-HSQC spectra in conjunction with the higher resolution two-dimensional {1H-15N} HSQC spectrum. In cases where both15N and 1H shifts were overlapped, a high resolution two-dimensional {1H-15N} HSQC spectrum obtained at lower temperature (292 K) proved useful. The sequential and medium-range NOE connectivities, summarized in Fig.2, clearly identify two helices, but show no sign of helix formation after the Gly-Met termination site for helix-2. Of the 77 backbone amide cross-peaks observed, 67 could be assigned to 68 residues, while the remainder exhibited no sequential connectivities. The majority of the unassigned residues are in what is a highly basic loop region in finger-2 (residues 149–155) of other structurally characterized nuclear hormone receptors and in the carboxyl-terminal region. Resonances for 15 of the 20 residues C-terminal of Arg-174 could not be assigned since sequential and medium-range NOEs are either weak or absent.Figure 2Sequential and medium-range NOEs in the hERR2 DBD (residues 96–178). Unassigned carboxyl-terminal residues are not shown. Sequential d NN,d αN, and d βN NOEs are categorized as strong, medium, or weak, according to theheight of the boxes. Medium-range NOEs are represented by bars connecting the appropriate residues. Resonance assignments for the segment C-terminal of Arg-174 were made on the basis of spin-type (Val-178, Tyr-185, and Asn-193) and weak (Asp-190 and Ser-191) d αN.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The medium-range NOEs summarized in Fig. 2 show one 13-residue helix (Glu-121–Gly-133) that starts at the carboxyl-terminal end of finger-1 and a second 12-amino acid helix (Gln-156–Gly-167) that starts at the carboxyl-terminal end of finger-2. The region after helix-2 shows no sign of secondary structure and may be disordered (see below). There is also a short antiparallel β-sheet between Cys-103/Leu-104 and Ser-119/Cys-120 based upon strongd αN connectivities and long-range NOEs between Cys-103 CαH and Cys-120 NH and between Ser-119 CαH and Leu-104 NH. This same β-sheet is also present in homologous sequences of the retinoid X (12Lee M.S. Kliewer S.A. Provencal J. Wright P.E. Evans R.M.

It is also interesting to note that the Val-105 and Cys-106 amide protons are two of the most persistent (along with three others discussed below) in D2O (∼30 h), suggesting that they are both protected from solvent and probably involved in strong internal hydrogen bonds. The equivalent residues in other zinc-finger proteins have been shown, through structural and/or H2O/D2O exchange data, to be hydrogen-bonded to S-γ of the first zinc-finger cysteine ligand (7Härd T.

This amide to S-γ hydrogen bond may be present in hERR2 based upon homology and the slow hydrogen/deuterium exchange rate. On the basis of long-range NOEs that had been identified (Fig.3 A), the 66-amino acid zinc-finger domain (i.e. up to the Gly-Met termination signal for helix-2) of hERR2 consists of two helices that are packed against each other to enclose a hydrophobic core consisting of Phe-126, Phe-127, Thr-130, Ile-131, Phe-160, and Leu-164 (Fig. 3 B). Long-range NOEs between residues in or near this hydrophobic core and Val-173 indicate that the region just past helix-2 also folds onto this hydrophobic core. A similar overall pattern of long-range NOEs was observed in the RXR (12Lee M.S. Kliewer S.A. Provencal J. Wright P.E. Evans R.M. Science. 1993; 260: 1117-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), suggesting that this part of the structure has a fold very similar to that of the retinoid X, estrogen (9Schwabe J.W.R.

The slow exchange rates for the amide protons of Cys-123, Lys-124, and Ala-125 suggest that these residues may be buried in the protein interior, which is reasonable since they reside on the amino-terminal end of helix-1, near the hydrophobic core. Alignment of the sequence with those of structurally characterized receptor molecules suggests that Cys-163 of hERR2 is not involved in coordinating zinc ions. The homologous cysteines in these hormone receptors are found close to the hydrophobic core and are partially solvent-accessible. Assuming that Cys-163 has similar spatial orientation, it could facilitate aggregation via disulfide formation at the high protein concentrations and temperatures employed for the NMR experiments and cause sample degradation over extended periods of time. Hence, to increase the intrinsic stability and solubility of hERR2, Cys-163 was replaced with an alanine. Alanine was chosen because it has comparable hydrophobic character to cysteine since it is probable that Cys-163 is partly buried. Gel-shift studies indicate that both the wild-type and C163A hERR2 DBDs have comparable affinities for the extended half-site sequence (data not shown). With the aid of the existing data for the wild-type hERR2 DBD, the proton and nitrogen chemical shifts were reassigned for the mutant protein from two- and three-dimensional 15N-edited spectra. Based on perturbations of amide proton and nitrogen chemical shifts (Fig. 4), the mutation has little effect on the structure, other than minor perturbations of groups near the hydrophobic core where Cys-163 is located. The perturbations of15N shifts for some residues in finger-1 (Fig.4 A) are consistent with long-range NOE data (Fig.3 A) that indicate that this region of finger-1 participates in the formation of the hydrophobic core. It should be noted that the three-dimensional 15N-edited spectra for the mutant protein did not enable us to extend the backbone resonance assignments beyond what was defined for the wild-type protein. Because of dramatically improved expression levels with the mutant gene construct, a uniformly13C,15N-labeled sample of the C163A hERR2 DBD was prepared, and triple-resonance experiments were recorded. The combination of three-dimensional HNCA and HNCOCA spectra allowed us to establish inter-residue connectivities using 13C-α chemical shift values and to complete the backbone assignments for the CTE of hERR2. The 13C-α chemical shift provides a reliable index of the local secondary structure; a downfield or upfield shift in δ(13C-α) is indicative of a helix or β-stranded configuration, respectively (54Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 363-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar, 55Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 311-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1791) Google Scholar). Comparison of the C-α chemical shifts in the mutant protein with random coil values (Fig. 5 A) reveals the same two helical elements observed in the wild-type DBD. Furthermore, the analysis establishes that the CTE does not adopt a regular secondary structure, but has chemical shifts characteristic of a random coil. The absence of long-range NOEs and most sequential NOEs for residues C-terminal of Arg-174 also provides strong evidence that the CTE is unstructured. It has been generally surmised that unstructured regions of a protein are characterized by increased main-chain flexibility. The dynamic properties of the DNA-binding domain of hERR2 in solution were evaluated by measuring heteronuclear {1H-15N} NOEs for the C163A variant. The magnitude of the steady-state {1H-15N} NOE is highly sensitive to the dynamics of the1H-15N vector; negative or small positive NOE values are diagnostic of significantly fast motions relative to the overall tumbling rate of the molecule. Residues in the CTE and the N terminus of the C163A hERR2 DBD exhibit diminished heteronuclear NOEs relative to those in the zinc-finger core (Fig. 5 B). The loop (Thr-148–Ser-155) between the sixth and seventh ligating cysteines represents the most flexible region of the zinc-finger core. In the CTE, the heteronuclear NOE begins to decrease C-terminal of Val-173, with near zero values reported for Arg-179–Arg-187 and negative values observed for the last six residues. This trend in heteronuclear NOE for the CTE is consistent with an unstructured polypeptide tethered to the folded zinc-finger domain. The flexible nature of the CTE also explains the absence of sequential and long-range interactions involving this region that could be identified from the two- and three-dimensional NOESY data sets. The evidence indeed supports that the functionally critical CTE of hERR2 is dynamically disordered. The region encompassing residues 103–168 of hERR2 shares a strong sequence homology with the zinc-finger domains of numerous members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. This domain and a region (CTE) immediately downstream of it comprise the minimum motif for site-specific 1:1 binding to an extended version of the canonical half-site sequence (5′-TCAAGGTCA-3′). We have constructed a recombinant form of the DBD of hERR2 and shown that it binds two zinc(II) ions/polypeptide. NMR structural analysis of the DBD indicates a polypeptide fold consisting of two orthogonally packed helices within the putative zinc-finger domain; this fold is typical of those observed in steroid and retinoid receptors. These data confirm that hERR2 is a member of the nuclear hormone receptor family of zinc-finger transcription factors. The zinc-finger domains of nuclear hormone receptors contain nine highly conserved cysteines, yet only the eight N-terminal cysteines are involved in coordinating the zinc ions. We have replaced the ninth cysteine (Cys-163) of hERR2 with an alanine. Comparison of the functional and solution NMR properties of the mutant with those of the wild-type protein suggests that Cys-163 is important neither for the proper folding of the polypeptide around the zinc sites nor for binding of the DBD to the cognate DNA. We cannot, however, exclude a functional role for this invariant cysteine in vivo. It is the 26-amino acid CTE that is of greatest functional interest in hERR2 since the equivalent regions in nerve growth factor I-B (23Wilson T.E. Paulsen R.E. Padgett K.A. Milbrandt J. Science. 1992; 256: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), steroidogenic factor-1 (19Parker K.L. Schimmer B.P. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1993; 4: 46-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and FTZ-F1 (FTZ-F1 box) (22Ueda H. Sun G.-C. Murata T. Hirose S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5667-5672Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) have been shown to provide key interactions for monomeric instead of dimeric binding to DNA (see above). The region has further been proposed to provide sequence-specific contacts with the 5′-base pairs in the response element (TCAAGGTCA in hERR2) (45Wilson T.E. Fahrner T.J. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5794-5804Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Prior to this work, no structural information was available on the CTE elements of monomer-binding receptors. The CTE of the hERR2 DBD (Fig.3 A) contains sequences corresponding to the T and A boxes in a number of structurally characterized dimer-binding receptors. In the RXR, the T box is helical and has been implicated in stabilizing the homodimer via protein-protein interactions (12Lee M.S. Kliewer S.A. Provencal J. Wright P.E. Evans R.M. Science. 1993; 260: 1117-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In the ternary complex of the thyroid hormone receptor, the RXR, and DNA (13Rastinejad F. Perlmann T. Evans R.M. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1995; 375: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar), the CTE of the thyroid hormone receptor does not participate in the dimer interface. Instead, the T box serves as a connecting loop to a long helical A box, which makes extensive nonspecific contacts with the DNA backbone. It is evident that the CTE of the thyroid hormone receptor has a different functional role than those of the monomer binders. Unlike those of the RXR and the thyroid hormone receptor wherein helices have been observed, the carboxyl-terminal T/A box region of hERR2 appears to be disordered, having no identifiable secondary structure. This is based on (a) C-α chemical shifts (Fig.5 A) that approach random coil values; (b) reduced heteronuclear {1H-15N} NOEs (Fig.5 B); (c) the appearance of an additional six HSQC peaks when gradient pulses or spin-lock purge pulses are used, rather than presaturation, for water suppression (data not shown); and (d) sequential NOEs that are either weak or absent. Since the CTE contributes to both affinity and specificity, it may adopt a defined secondary structure upon DNA binding as in the trprepressor or glucocorticoid receptor (8Luisi B.F. Xu W.X. Otwinowski Z. Freedman L.P. Yamamoto K.R. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1991; 352: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar, 56Record Jr., M.T. Spolar R.S. Science. 1994; 263: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar), or it may adopt an ordered but extended structure as in GATA-1 (57Omichinski J.G. Clore G.M. Schaad O. Felsenfeld G. Trainor C. Appella E. Stahl S.J. Gronenborn A. Science. 1993; 261: 438-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Preliminary NMR studies of the C163A hERR2-DNA complex suggest that ordering of the CTE does occur upon binding to DNA,3 and studies of the structure of the complex are currently in progress.

The net vectorial transport of bile acids into the biliary drainage system is the major determinant of bile secretion. Transport across the canalicular domain of the hepatocyte represents the rate-limiting step in this system. Studies in canalicular membrane vesicles have indicated that canalicular bile acid efflux is predominantly driven by ATP, but electrochemical membrane potential may also drive canalicular bile acid transport to a certain extent. Most data suggest that several distinct transporters, or transport systems, are involved (1Blitzer B.L. Boyer J.L.

It is a ∼110-kDa phosphoglycoprotein localized to the canalicular domain of hepatocytes. It was purified by bile acid affinity chromatography from detergent-solubilized rat liver canalicular membrane vesicles (7Sippel C.J. Ananthanarayanan M. Suchy F.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 21: G728-G737Google Scholar). Internal amino acid sequence analysis revealed it to be identical to the rat liver ecto-ATPase and to the cell adhesion molecule cell CAM 105. It has a carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail of 71 amino acids, a single membrane-spanning domain, and a large extracellular amino-terminal tail of 423 amino acids, which has extensive homology with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and the immunoglobulin supergene family. Transfection studies have shown that CBATP mediates ecto-ATPase, cell adhesion, and bile acid efflux activities in heterologous COS cells (8Sippel C.J. Suchy F.J. Ananthanarayanan M. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2083-2091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Cheung P.H. Thompson N.L. Earley K. Culic O. Hixson D. Lin S.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6139-6146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies have shown that R98 within an ATPase consensus sequence at the extreme amino terminus is required for ecto-ATPase activity and that the 108 amino acid amino-terminal domain is required for cell adhesion activity (10Sippel C.J.

Deletion of the cytoplasmic tail is associated with loss of bile acid efflux, ecto-ATPase, and cell adhesion activities, even though the protein is appropriately localized to the external surface of the plasma membrane and can bind ATP (8Sippel C.J.

Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6139-6146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of phosphorylation consensus sequences in the cytoplasmic tail shows that protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation of Ser503 is required for bile acid efflux activity, that tyrosine kinase-dependent phosphorylation of Tyr488 regulates bile acid efflux activity, but neither phosphorylation is necessary for ecto-ATPase activity. Finally, bile acid efflux activity of CBATP was found to be dependent on ATP, particularly extracellular ATP, but not on its own ecto-ATPase activity (12Sippel C.J. Fallon R.J. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19539-19545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In these previous studies, the bile acid efflux activity of CBATP was demonstrated in transfected COS cells by first loading the cells with [3H]taurocholate via nonspecific pinocytosis using the approach that had been pioneered in studies of efflux of chemotherapeutic agents by the multidrug resistance gene products (MDR) (8Sippel C.J. Suchy F.J. Ananthanarayanan M. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2083-2091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To get sufficient nonspecific uptake, the membrane potential of the transfected COS cells had to be clamped pharmacologically with valinomycin (8Sippel C.J. Suchy F.J. Ananthanarayanan M. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2083-2091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although this system allowed us to show that CBATP had bile acid efflux activity and that this could be proven by a number of genetic criteria, the assay was cumbersome and was not amenable to studying the role of membrane potential in bile acid efflux. To develop a more physiological system and a system that could be more easily manipulated pharmacologically, we have established a model system in which uptake of [3H]taurocholate is mediated by transfection of a cloned bile acid importer, IBAT, and efflux is assayed by cotransfection of CBATP cDNA. Wild-type and mutant rat CBATP constructs have been described previously (8Sippel C.J. Suchy F.J. Ananthanarayanan M. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 24303-24310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This includes pExp3, R98ACBATP, Y488F-CBATP, T502,S503A-CBATP, and truncated CBATP. The hamster IBAT construct (IBAT-44 final) has also been described previously (13Wong M.H. Oelkers P. Craddock A.L. Dawson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1340-1347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The CEA cDNA (gcg:humcea; Ref. 14Barnett T. Goebel S.J. NothDurft M.A. Elting J.J. Genomics. 1988; 3: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), kindly provided by Thomas Barnett, was subcloned into theHindIII-XbaI site of pCDM8. Three new constructs, R98A CEA, CBATP-CEA chimera, and CBATP-R98ACEA chimera, were generated using the polymerase chain reaction overlap extension technique (15Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Snisky J.W. White T.H. PCR Protocols. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1990: 177-180Google Scholar) and then subcloned into the pCDM8 vector. For R98ACEA, the outside primers corresponded with nucleotides 85–100 and 993–1012 of CEA together with a spacer of four nucleotides, a newEcoRI restriction site, and a new BamHI restriction site (5′-TCATGAATTCAGAGGAGGACAGAGC-3′; 5′-GGCACGTATAGGATCCACTA-3′). The inside primers corresponded to nucleotides 393–416 of CEA (5′-CGCATACAGTGGTGCAGAGATAAT-3′; 5′-ATTATCTCTGCACCACTGTATGCG-3′). The resulting polymerase chain reaction fragment was subcloned into wild-type CEA in the pCDM8 vector, which had been digested previously withEcoRI/BamHI and purified away from the wild-type internal fragment. For the CEA-CBAT chimera, the outside primers corresponded to nucleotides 1563–1585 of CEA and nucleotides 1628–1651 of CBATP together with new EcoRI and XbaI restriction sites, and the inside primers corresponded to nucleotides 2122–2136 of CEA (five amino acids just external to the membrane insertion site of CEA) and nucleotides 1316–1330 of CBATP (transmembrane domain of CBATP): outside primers (5′-CAGTGGCCACAGCAGGACTACAG-3; 5′-GAATTCTCTAGACTGGTGCAGTCAGCAGGACAGACA-3′); inside primers (5′-TGAGAGGCCAGAATTGACTGTGATGCTCTT-3′; 5′-AAGAGCATCACAGTCAATTCTGGCCTCTCA-3′). The resulting 0.95-kilobase polymerase chain reaction fragment was digested withBalI and XbaI and cloned into pBluescript together with a 1.5-kilobase BalI/EcoRI partial digest of wild-type CEA. The resulting insert was removed atHindIII/XbaI to be subcloned into pCDM8. A similar strategy was used for the CBATP-R98ACEA chimera using the R98ACEA construct described above. In each case, the constructs were characterized by restriction map analysis (16Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 166: 557-580Crossref Scopus (8216) Google Scholar, 17Birnboin H.C. Boly J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 7: 1513-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (9908) Google Scholar) and by dideoxynucleotide sequencing (18Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4767-4771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar) to confirm the construct and to exclude polymerase chain reaction sequence artifacts. COS 1 cells were transfected by the DEAE-dextran method and used for experimental purposes 48 h after transfection (19Cullen B.R. Berger S.L. Kimmel A.R. Methods in Enzymology. 152. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1987: 692-693Google Scholar). In specific experiments, cellular ATP was depleted by incubating transfected COS cells for 20 min at 37 °C in DMEM without glucose but supplemented with 20 mm2-deoxyglucose and 10 mm sodium azide. Under these conditions, cellular concentrations of ATP could be lowered from 800–1200 μm to 6–8 μm, as determined by the ATP luciferase assay (20Yih L.H. Hunag H. Jan K.Y. Lee T. Cell Biol. Int. Rep. 1991; 15: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Results were normalized for protein concentration as determined by the Lowry assay (21Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under these conditions, cell viability as determined by trypan blue exclusion (22Blitzer B. Ratoosh S.L. Donovan C.B. Boyer J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 6: G48-G53Google Scholar) was not significantly different between these depleted cells and undepleted cells (data not shown). Transfected Cos cells were incubated with DMEM supplemented with [3H]taurocholate in excess. At the end of the uptake period, cell monolayers were lysed in 1n NaOH, and the cell lysates were subjected to scintillation counting. In separate experiments, the time, temperature, and concentration of [3H]taurocholate were varied to determine the optimal conditions for uptake. Transfected Cos cells were incubated with [3H]taurocholate under optimal conditions for uptake. At the end of the uptake period, monolayers were washed extensively in PBS and incubated for specified time intervals in DMEM alone for the efflux period. In specified experiments, 5 μm ATP, 1 mm DIDS, and/or unlabeled taurocholate were added. Extracellular medium was harvested, and cell monolayers were lysed in 1 n NaOH. The extracellular medium and cell lysates were then subjected to scintillation counting. Counts in the extracellular medium were converted to picomoles on the basis of the specific activity of the initial [3H]taurocholate and then plotted as pmoles/milligram protein/minute. Kinetic data (K m and V max) were determined on the basis of the resulting curves. Ecto-ATPase activity was measured by a method described previously (23Lin S.-H. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14408-14414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) 48 h after transfection. For Western blot analysis, antibody to CBATP was used in a protocol described previously (7Sippel C.J. Ananthanarayanan M. Suchy F.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 21: G728-G737Google Scholar). Methods described previously were also used for studies of biosynthesis (24Perlmutter D.H. Punsal P.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16499-16503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cell surface iodination (25Lederkremer G.Z. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1237-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and immunoprecipitation followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis/fluorography (24Perlmutter D.H. Punsal P.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16499-16503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We determined the conditions under which uptake of [3H]taurocholate was saturated in COS cells transfected with IBAT alone or IBAT and CBATP cDNA together. To determine the duration of time necessary for saturation of uptake, transfected COS cells were incubated at 22 °C with [3H]taurocholate, 400 μm, for several different time intervals (Fig.1 A). Cells were lysed in 1 n NaOH and subjected to scintillation counting. Uptake was time-dependent, reaching a plateau within 20 min. There was no significant difference between cells transfected with IBAT alone and cells transfected with IBAT and CBATP together. Then the transfected COS cells were incubated for 20 min with [3H]taurocholate, 400 μm, at several different temperatures (Fig. 1 B). Uptake was temperature-dependent, reaching a plateau at 22 °C. There was no significant difference between cells transfected with IBAT alone and those transfected with IBAT and CBATP together. Next, the transfected COS cells were incubated for 20 min at 22 °C in [3H]taurocholate in several different concentrations (Fig. 1 C). The results show that uptake was concentration-dependent, reaching a plateau between 200 and 400 μm. In COS cells transfected with IBAT and CBATP, there was a minimal decrease in the amount of uptake as compared with COS cells transfected with IBAT alone. This is probably due to efflux mediated by cotransfected CBATP. Efflux mediated by cotransfected CBATP does not have a more significant effect in Fig. 1 C or any effect in Fig. 1, A and B, because these experiments were done in the absence of exogenous ATP. Because efflux mediated by CBATP is stimulated by exogenous ATP (see Fig. 3), this means that there will be minimal efflux mediated by CBATP during uptake studies done in the absence of exogenous ATP. Even when exogenous ATP is present, CBATP pumps [3H]taurocholate out of cells less efficiently than IBAT pumps [3H]taurocholate into cells. For uptake mediated by IBAT, K m ≅ 23 μm and V max ≅ 396 pmol/mg protein/min (13Wong M.H. Oelkers P. Craddock A.L. Dawson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1340-1347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and for efflux mediated by CBATP in the presence of exogenous ATP, K m ≅ 70 μm andV max ≅ 400 pmol/mg protein/min (Fig.2 A). When uptake of [3H]taurocholate was assayed in the presence of exogenous ATP (5 mm), there was ∼40–50% reduction in uptake after 60 min in COS cells cotransfected with IBAT and CBATP as compared with COS cells transfected with IBAT alone (Fig. 1 D).Figure 3Effect of ATP on bile acid efflux in cotransfected COS cells. Cells were cotransfected with IBAT and CBATP cDNA and studied 48 h later. At that time, the cells were incubated for 20 min at 22 °C with 400 μm[3H]taurocholate to load the cells as well as 20 mm 2-deoxyglucose and 10 mm sodium azide to deplete cellular ATP. Previous studies have shown that these conditions severely deplete cellular ATP levels but do not affect cell viability or one function of CBAT, its ecto-ATPase activity (20Yih L.H. Hunag H. Jan K.Y. Lee T. Cell Biol. Int. Rep. 1991; 15: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These conditions did not significantly alter uptake of [3H]taurocholate (data not shown). The cells were then washed and incubated for 5 min at 22 °C with fresh unlabeled medium in the absence or presence of 1 mm DIDS and in absence or presence of ATP in several different concentrations.

(bars).IC, cell monolayers; EC, extracellular medium.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Taken together, the experiments in Fig. 1 (A–C) show that uptake reaches a plateau at 200–400 μm in the cotransfected cells and establish a time of 20 min, temperature of 22 °C, and concentration of [3H]taurocholate of 400 μm as optimal for the subsequent studies. In each case, the uptake of [3H]taurocholate was 20-fold or more greater in COS cells transfected with IBAT alone or both IBAT and CBATP than untransfected COS cells and COS cells transfected with CBATP alone and pharmacologically clamped with valinomycin (8Sippel C.J. Suchy F.J. Ananthanarayanan M. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2083-2091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Next, we examined the possibility that CBATP mediated bile acid efflux under these conditions. For Fig. 2 A, COS cells were transfected with IBAT alone, cotransfected with IBAT and CBATP, or cotransfected with IBAT and a mutant CBATP (T502A, S503A-CBATP). Our previous studies had shown that this mutant CBATP did not undergo protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation and lacked bile acid efflux activity, even though it was appropriately targeted to the external surface of the plasma membrane (12Sippel C.J. Fallon R.J. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19539-19545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After 48 h, the cells were incubated at 22 °C for 60 min with [3H]taurocholate in several different concentrations. At the end of this time interval, the cells were washed extensively and incubated at 22 °C for 5 min in the absence of [3H]taurocholate, in the presence of ATP, and in the absence or presence of DIDS. Radioactivity appearing in the extracellular medium was determined by scintillation counting. The results show that there was DIDS-sensitive, concentration-dependent, and saturable efflux only in cells cotransfected with IBATP and CBATP, not in cells transfected with IBAT alone or cotransfected with IBAT and mutant T502A, S503A-CBATP. Efflux had curvilinear characteristics, with a V max of 400 pmol/mg protein/min and aK m of 70 μm. These values are similar to those obtained using our previous assay system. These values are also similar to values that have been reported previously in canalicular vesicle studies (17Birnboin H.C. Boly J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 7: 1513-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (9908) Google Scholar). For the studies shown in Fig.2 A, we also measured radioactivity remaining in cell lysates. The results were plotted as pmoles/mg protein/minuteversus concentration of taurocholate and showed that disappearance from the cell had almost identical curvilinear characteristics, K m and V maxvalues (data not shown) as observed in Fig. 2 A for appearance in the extracellular medium. In both cases, however, we did not determine what proportion of taurocholate that is in the cells is freely available for efflux. Thus, the K m andV max values reported here must be considered estimates which apply only if all the taurocholate in the cell is freely available for efflux. Next, we examined the time course of efflux mediated by CBATP (Fig.2 B). COS cells transfected with IBAT alone or cotransfected with IBAT and CBATP were incubated for 60 min at 22 °C with [3H]taurocholate 400 μm. At the end of this time interval, the cells were washed extensively and then incubated at 22 °C for several different time intervals in medium supplemented with unlabeled taurocholate (400 μm) and 5 mmATP in the absence or presence of 1 mm DIDS. At the end of each time interval, the extracellular medium was harvested, and the cell monolayers were lysed for analysis by scintillation counting. Results are reported as a relative percentage using counts present in the cell lysate at time 0 as arbitrarily designated 100%. There was no difference in the counts present in the cell lysates at time 0 for cells transfected with IBAT alone or cells cotransfected with IBAT and CBATP. For cells cotransfected with IBAT and CBATP, the results show that there is time-dependent disappearance of radioactivity from the cells between time 0 and 5 min, coincident with the appearance of radioactivity in the extracellular medium. Almost 80% of the initial radioactivity has disappeared from the cells by 5 min of the chase period, and a similar percentage has appeared in the extracellular medium. The majority of this disappearance from cell monolayers and appearance in extracellular medium is DIDS-sensitive. There is, however, some radioactivity that leaks from the cells in the presence of DIDS. Interestingly, this DIDS-insensitive fraction has different kinetics, reaching a plateau within 3 min. For cells transfected with IBAT alone, there is some time-dependent disappearance of radioactivity from the cells and appearance of radioactivity in the extracellular medium. It is much less than that observed in the cotransfected cells. Only 30% of the initial radioactivity disappears, even by 10 min. This disappearance is completely insensitive to DIDS and is identical in magnitude and kinetics to the DIDS-insensitive fraction of the cotransfected cells, therefore providing evidence that it represents nonspecific diffusion. Unlabeled taurocholate was used in this experiment to optimize the chase effect, but similar results have been observed without unlabeled taurocholate (data not shown). Taken together, these studies show that CBATP can mediate specific, facilitated efflux of taurocholate in cotransfected COS cells and that its efflux properties can be detected more easily, over a longer duration of time and in the absence of the pharmacologic agent valinomycin originally used to promote nonspecific uptake of taurocholate by clamping the membrane potential. Now we could use this assay to examine the possibility that bile acid efflux mediated by CBATP is driven by ATP and/or membrane potential differences. COS cells were cotransfected with IBAT and CBATP and then, 48 h later, the cotransfected cells were incubated in 2-deoxyglucose and sodium azide under conditions associated with depletion of cellular ATP but without affecting cell viability. During this same 20-min interval, 400 μm[3H]taurocholate were also added to the medium for uptake studies. The cells were then washed extensively, and separate monolayers were incubated in the absence or presence of 1 mm DIDS and in the absence or presence of exogenous ATP in several different concentrations for an efflux assay of 5 min (Fig.3). The results show that there is no efflux in the absence of ATP. It also shows that efflux is absolutely dependent on ATP. The effect of extracellular ATP is concentration-dependent and saturable with aK m ≅ 10 μm andV max of 300 pmol/mg protein/min. To determine whether the electrochemical potential of the membrane drives bile acid efflux activity mediated by CBATP, we examined the effect of clamping the membrane potential with valinomycin. Cells were cotransfected with IBAT and CBATP and then, 48 h later, incubated with 150 μm [3H]taurocholate in the absence and presence of DIDS and in the absence or presence of 100 μm valinomycin, an ionophore that clamps the membrane potential (8Sippel C.J.

The results show that valinomycin does not inhibit bile acid efflux (data not shown). Taken together, these data indicate that bile acid efflux mediated by CBATP is dependent on ATP but not on the electrochemical membrane potential. Thus, it cannot account for electrogenic bile acid transport demonstrated previously in canalicular membrane vesicles (26Nishida T. Chez M. Gaitman Z. Arias I.M.

https://openalex.org/W2041057096,"A novel cDNA fragment, named cca1 (confluent 3Y1 cell-associated 1), was previously isolated on the basis of preferential accumulation of the corresponding mRNA in growth-arrested confluent but not in growing subconfluent rat 3Y1 cells. The cca1 cDNA was found to consist of 5022 nucleotides with an open reading frame of 1905 nucleotides, encoding a protein of 635 amino acids. Unlike the 3Y1 cell case, cca1 mRNA was not detected in confluent 3Y1 BU, 3Y1 BU/pTK, 3Y1-16E6, or F2408 cells, whose growth patterns monitored by phalloidin staining and bromodeoxyuridine incorporation were different from those of the confluent 3Y1 cells. A restoration of the confluent 3Y1-type growth pattern was observed in the cca1 cDNA-introduced 3Y1 BU and 3Y1 BU/pTK cells after reaching confluence but not in the cDNA-introduced 3Y1-16E6 or F2408 cells. The results allow us to conclude that cca1 is required but not sufficient for formation of growth-arrested confluent monolayer of 3Y1 cells.

The results allow us to conclude that cca1 is required but not sufficient for formation of growth-arrested confluent monolayer of 3Y1 cells. 3Y1, a 3T3-type Fischer rat cell line, has widely been utilized as a model system to study whether or not viral or cellular gene(s) can transform cultured cells (1Kimura G. Itagaki A. Summers J. Int. J. Cancer. 1975; 15: 694-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). When the cells reach confluence in cultured dishes, they stop growing and change their shape from a spindle-like form to a cobblestone-like form, so that the cell sheet becomes a typical monolayer of low cell density. In contrast, 3Y1 cells bearing E6 genes of oncogenic human papillomaviruses such as type 16 (hereafter called 3Y1-16E6) continue to grow without changing their morphological characteristics after reaching confluence, so that the cell sheet becomes a higher cell density than that of the original 3Y1 cells (2Hiraiwa A. Kiyono T. Segawa K. Utsumi K.R. Ohashi M. Ishibashi M. Virology. 1993; 192: 102-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A derivative line of 3Y1 (named 3Y1 BUr-1 by others and hereafter called 3Y1 BU) and F2408 cell line (established independently from the 3Y1 line) also keep growing without changing their shape after reaching confluence. This difference in growth patterns between 3Y1 and the latter three cell lines has led us to speculate that 3Y1 cells carry a gene(s) whose mRNA is up-regulated after confluence so as to bring about the growth arrest. The speculation was supported by findings with hybrids between 3Y1 and 3Y1 BU or F2408. In both cases, the growth pattern of the 3Y1 cells appeared dominant, 1Y. Hayashi, T. Kiyono, M. Fujita, and M. Ishibashi, unpublished data. prompting us to isolate the candidate gene(s). As an approach to isolation of cDNAs whose corresponding mRNAs are detectable in growth-arrested confluent but not in growing subconfluent 3Y1 cells, we chose the mRNA differential display method (3Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4697) Google Scholar, 4Liang P. Averboukh L. Pardee A.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3269-3275Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). Our screening allowed us to obtain four cDNA fragments that satisfied this criterion: one of them was considered to be a rat homologue of gas1 (growtharrest-specific reported by others (5Del Sal G. Ruaro M.E. Philipson L. Schneider C. Cell. 1992; 70: 595-607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), but the other three appeared novel and were tentatively named cca1–cca3 (confluent 3Y1 cell-associated) (6Hayashi Y. Kiyono T. Fujita M. Ishibashi M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1352: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). RNase protection assay with a cca1 cDNA fragment as a probe revealed that although 3Y1 cells contained an appreciable amount of the mRNA after confluence as expected, the other line cells referred in the above did not. In the present paper, we describe (i) the construction of cca1 cDNA covering a large open reading frame (ORF), 2The abbreviations used are: ORF, open reading frame; aa, amino acid; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; nt, nucleotide(s); kb, kilobase pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; gapdh, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline.

The cells were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum except where specified. Fisher rat-derived embryonic 3Y1 cells (1Kimura G. Itagaki A. Summers J. Int.

Virology. 1992; 187: 343-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) were generously donated by Dr. Kimura and Dr. Hakura, respectively. The thymidine kinase-minus 3Y1 BUr-1 cells (called 3Y1 BU cells for convenience) were also kindly provided by Dr. Kimura. 3Y1 cells containing E6 gene of human papillomavirus type 16, called 3Y1-16E6 cells, were prepared as described earlier (2Hiraiwa A. Kiyono T. Segawa K. Utsumi K.R. Ohashi M. Ishibashi M. Virology. 1993; 192: 102-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Neomycin-resistant cells were selected in the medium supplemented with 200 mg/ml G418. PA317 and COS cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimal essential medium with 10% fetal calf serum for packaging of retrovirus (8Miller A.K. Buttimore C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2895-2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar) and for transient expression of cca1 cDNA, respectively. Cells harvested 2 days before reaching confluence were used as subconfluent cells and 3 days after as confluent cells. To monitor the growth activity of 3Y1 BU cells by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation, the cells were transfected with pTK4 containing the herpesvirus thymidine kinase gene (9Fujita M. Murata K. Shiku H. Blood. 1994; 84: 2591-2596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), followed by selection in the medium supplemented with 100 mm hypoxantine, 0.5 mm aminopterin, and 20 mm thymidine. 300 colonies of drug-resistant cells were pooled (named 3Y1 BU/pTK) and used as 3Y1 BU equivalents in the BrdUrd incorporation assay. The cca1 cDNA fragment (372 nucleotides (nt)) used as probe DNA for cca1 cDNA cloning was obtained as one of four cDNA fragments isolated by the mRNA differential display method on the basis of the preferential accumulation of the corresponding mRNAs in confluent but not in subconfluent 3Y1 cells (6Hayashi Y.

A cDNA library was constructed with 1 μg of poly(A)+RNA extracted from confluent 3Y1 cells (SuperScript Choice system, Life Technologies, Inc.). First strand cDNA synthesis was performed using an oligo(dT) primer. After second strand cDNA was synthesized, the obtained double stranded cDNA was ligated toEcoRI (NotI) adaptors. After size fractionation, 50 ng of EcoRI-adapted double stranded cDNA was cloned into the Lambda ZAPII vector arm (Stratagene). The recombinant λ DNA was packaged with packaging extract (Gigapackll Gold, Stratagene), and then the resulting phage was mixed with strain XL1-Blue MRF′ host cells and plated on NZY plates. The library contained 2 × 106 recombinants. For screening, 1 × 105plaques of the amplified library were plated at a density of 5000 plaque forming units/100 × 150 mm2 dish. Duplicate lifts were made from each of 20 dishes using nylon membranes (Gene Screen, NEN Life Science Products). The membranes were hybridized with cca1 probe labeled with [32P]dCTP, and those plaques that specifically hybridized with the probe were isolated. After a second plaque hybridization, six clones were isolated, the longest of which was found to contain a 3.8-kb cDNA region. When the library was rescreened, no cDNA clone with a length of more than 3.8 kb could be isolated. We therefore generated the remaining 5′ DNA region (1.2 kb) by the rapid amplification of cDNA ends method (5′-AmpliFINDER RACE, CLONTECH). Three independent clones were isolated by independent PCR and sequenced (Sequencing PRO, Toyobo). Although sequence heterogeneity was observed for the GC-rich portion of the 5′-untranslated region, a probable sequence was determined. The DNA fragment obtained was ligated at the EcoO109I site (nt 1173) to the above cDNA clone. To amplify the entire 1905-nt ORF (nt 363–2267) of the cca1 cDNA, the 11AFNOT primer containing the nt 347–377 region of the cDNA and the 11AP5 primer corresponding to the nt 3436–3450 region of the cDNA were used. The retroviral vector derived from the moloney murine leukemia virus, named pLRNL, contains the neomycin resistance gene under control of Rous sarcoma virus promoter (10Emi N. Friedmann T. Yee J.K. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1202-1207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To obtain cca1 cDNA expression vector (pLRNL-cca1), the 3.6-kb DNA fragment containing the cDNA region of 3571 nt (nt 345–3915) was introduced into the BamHI site of the pLRNL vector. To construct pLRNL-cca1(-atg), the six nucleotides (nt 360–365) containing the first ATG site of the cDNA were replaced with aBamHI site, and the BamHI fragment containing 3550 nt (nt 366–3915) of the cDNA was cloned into theBamHI site of the pLRNL vector. By using this first ATG-minus construct, the N-terminal region-deleted protein (222 amino acids (aa); aa 414–635) would be expected to be produced from the ATG (nt 1602) for the second methionine. The upstream in-frame stop codon was located in the vector DNA sequence. To express cca1 cDNA in COS cells at a high level, the pEF-BOS vector containing the promoter region of human elongation factor 1α and the SV40 replication origin was used (11Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar). After removing the stuffer DNA by digesting the vector with BstXI andNotI, the DNA sequence for the Myc epitope (10 aa; EQKLISEEDL) located just before the new cloning site (BamHI) was introduced as a BstXI-NotI fragment so as to produce the expression vector for the Myc epitope-tagged protein (pEF-Myc). The cca1 cDNA expression vector, pEF-Myc cca1, was constructed by cloning the BamHI fragment of pLRNL-cca1(-atg) into pEF-Myc vector. The rat gapdh sequence was amplified with specific primers (CLONTECH) by PCR, using oligo(dT) primed 3Y1 cDNAs as template DNAs. The PCR product was cloned into pMOSBlue-T vector (Amersham Corp.), and then the resulting plasmid, pMOS-gapdh, was used for the preparation of the control probe for the RNase protection assay. 10-μg aliquots of pLRNL-cca1, pLRNL-cca1(-atg), or pLRNL were introduced into the amphotropic helper line PA317 (8Miller A.K. Buttimore C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2895-2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar) by electroporation (Gene Pulser, Bio-Rad) at 350 V and 500 microfarad. Two days post-transfection, the medium was harvested from the cells, filtered, and then used for infection in the presence of 8 μg/ml polybrene (Sigma). 200–300 colonies of neomycin-resistant cells were pooled and used as the plasmid DNA-introduced cells. Total RNA samples were extracted from the cultured line cell by the acid guanidium thiocyanate-phenol/chloroform method as described previously (12Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63169) Google Scholar) or by using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Total RNAs were also prepared from several organs of 10 week-Fischer rats (male) using ISOGEN (Nippon Gene). Poly(A)+ RNA fractions were enriched using oligo(dT)-Latex (OLIGOTEX-dT30, Roche). RNase protection assays were performed with antisense strand RNA probes synthesized with T7 polymerase (MAXIscript, Ambion). Total RNA was hybridized with RNA probes at 42 °C overnight. After RNase treatment with 0.5 units of RNaseA and 20 units of RNase T1 (RPAII, Ambion), the protected RNA was electrophoresed on 5% urea-polyacrylamide gels. The cca1 RNA probe corresponds to the 372-nt cca1 cDNA sequence (nt 4651–5022). Because the pLRNL-cca1 plasmid DNA lacks the 3′ DNA region of cca1 cDNA (nt 3916–5022), the cca1 mRNA transcribed from the exogenous template derived from this plasmid DNA would not be expected to be protected by the cca1 probe. Therefore, the cca1* probe corresponding to the 384-nt cDNA sequence (nt 345–728) was used to detect the mRNA transcribed from the plasmid DNA template, as well as the endogenous template. The size of the band protected by the cca1* probe in the mRNA transcribed from pLRNL-cca1(-atg) DNA was slightly smaller (363 nt), because the plasmid DNA lacked the 21-nt DNA sequence (nt 345–365) of the cDNA region corresponding to the probe. An oligopeptide (IPTTYEKQRADDPC) of the predicted CCA1 protein (aa 38–53) was synthesized, coupled with keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and then used for immunization of rabbit. For purification of the antibodies against CCA1 protein by affinity chromatography, rabbit serum was applied to the 2-fluoro-1-methylpyridinium toluelene-4-sulfonate-activated cellulofine column coupled with the 15-aa oligopeptide. The bound antibodies were eluted with 0.1 m glycine-HCl (pH 2.5) and immediately neutralized with 1 m Tris. After NaCl and sodium azide were added to 0.15 m and 0.03%, respectively, the resulting fraction was used as the anti-CCA1 antibodies (0.1 mg/ml protein). For Western blotting, cell lysates were prepared by adding sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue), followed by vigorous mixing and boiling for 5 min. After SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, proteins were blotted electrophoretically onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) and blocked by soaking in PBS-T buffer (0.1% Tween 20 in PBS) supplemented with 10% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% sodium azide at 4 °C overnight. After washing with PBS-T buffer, the membranes were incubated with rabbit anti-Myc epitope antibodies (Medical & Biological Laboratories) at 3 μg/ml or rabbit anti-CCA1 antibodies at 0.3 μg/ml and then were probed with horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Zymed), both steps for 1 h at room temperature, and finally proteins were visualized using the ECL system (Amersham Corp.). BrdUrd incorporation assays were performed using a cell proliferation kit (Amersham Corp.) with slight modifications. Briefly, the cells were labeled by incubation for 24 h in fresh medium supplemented with BrdUrd, fixed in acid-ethanol (5% acetic acid and 5% distilled water in ethanol) for 30 min at room temperature, and incubated with mouse anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibody for 1 h at room temperature. After incubation with horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG at room temperature for 30 min. BrdUrd incorporation into nuclei was visualized by staining with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride. The percentage of BrdUrd-incorporating cells was determined by counting the mean numbers of BrdUrd-incorporating cell in three different areas in two independent experiments. After culturing in chamber slides (Nunc), cells were fixed with 4% freshly prepared paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min and permeabilized for 10 min with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS as described (13Hedberg K.M. Bell P.B.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 219: 266-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Cells were then incubated with tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma) in a moist chamber for 20 min. The organization of the cytoskeletal actin filaments of the cells was then examined under a fluorescent microscope. A cDNA clone (3.8 kb) was isolated from the confluent 3Y1 cell library using the cca1 probe obtained as described under “Materials and Methods.” The remaining DNA region (1.2 kb) was generated with 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends method and then ligated to the above cDNA clone at the overlapping EcoO109I site. Thus obtained cca1 cDNA consisted of 5022 nt (Fig. 1), which was compatible with the size of the corresponding mRNA estimated by Northern blot analysis (5 kb) (6Hayashi Y. Kiyono T. Fujita M. Ishibashi M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1352: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). There was an ORF of 1905 nt, which started from the first ATG (nt 363) right after the in-frame TGA stop codon (nt 354) and encoded a 635-aa protein with a calculated molecular mass of 69 kDa. The DNA sequence (GCAATGG) including the first ATG resembled Kozak's consensus sequence (14Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4168) Google Scholar). To preclude the possibility that the ORF was a chimeric artifact between two partially identical fused ORFs, a reverse transcription-PCR experiment was conducted with 11AFBAM and 11AP5 primers, designed to amplify the entire ORF as described under “Materials and Methods”: a single PCR product with the size and restriction enzyme sites expected was detected from the mRNA of confluent 3Y1 cells (data not shown). The 3′-untranslated DNA region contained a polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) at nt 5005 (−17 nt from first A of poly(A) tail; shown as underlined in Fig.1) and three copies of the consensus element (ATTTA; shown asboxed in Fig. 1) involved in mRNA instability (15Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3123) Google Scholar) at nt 3884, 3948, and 4749. The DNA region (372 nt) used as the cca1 probe for the isolation of the above cDNA clone was located at nt 4651–5022. Homology searches indicated that cca1 cDNA and the predicted amino acid sequences have no similarities to genes and proteins accessible in the data bases of GenBank™ and EMBL nucleotide sequence and SWISS-PROT, PIR, and PRF protein sequence. RNA preparations in a number of rat organs were examined for the cca1 mRNA level. The cca1 mRNA was detected in all organs tested with relative amounts in brain and jejunum comparable with that in confluent 3Y1 cells (Fig.2). A single protein band was detected with both anti-Myc epitope (lane 2in Fig. 3 A) and anti-CCA1 antibodies (lane 2 in Fig. 3 B) in COS cells transiently transfected with the cDNA for the Myc-tagged CCA1 protein (pEF-Myc cca1). In each case, the size of the protein detected was estimated to be 70 kDa, compatible with the size of the predicted molecular mass of CCA1 protein (69 kDa). Immunofluorescent analysis of the COS cells transfected with pEF-Myc cca1 indicated a cytoplasmic location for the protein (data not shown). In confluent 3Y1 cells, the anti-CCA1 antibodies we prepared could not detect any specific proteins (data not shown). Because the relative level of cca1 mRNA in confluent 3Y1 cells was found to be only less than one-thousandth of that in the COS cells transfected with pEF-Myc cca1 (data not shown), it seemed likely that the level of the CCA1 protein in the confluent 3Y1 cells was too low for antibody detection. During the formation of confluent 3Y1 monolayer, 3Y1 cells changed their shape (Fig.4 A) with a different organization of the cytoskeletal actin filament (Fig. 4 B), and the percentage of BrdUrd-incorporating cells was reduced to 6% (Fig. 4 C). In contrast, 3Y1 BU, its derivative (3Y1 BU/pTK), 3Y1-16E6, and F2408 cells retained their typical morphology with the same actin filament organization even after confluence, and a considerably higher percentage of cells continued to incorporate BrdUrd (see TableI). The observations were essentially the same for over at least 1 week after confluence (data not shown). Using RNA preparations of the above cells, the cca1 mRNA level in 3Y1 BU, 3Y1 BU/pTK, 3Y1-16E6, and F2408 cells were compared with those in 3Y1 cells. In the former cells, cca1 mRNA was not detected irrespective of their culture conditions (Fig. 5 and Table I). The results indicate that cca1 mRNA level is up-regulated in association with the growth pattern of confluent 3Y1 cells.Table IAssociation of cca1 mRNA levels with cell growth patternsCellsCulture conditioncca1 mRNA levelActin filament organizationPercentage of BrdUrd incorporating cells3Y1Subconfluence−Stress fibers100Confluence+Cortical filaments63Y1 BUSubconfluence−Stress fibersND1-aND, not determined.Confluence−Stress fibersND3Y1 BU/pTKSubconfluence−Stress fibers100Confluence−Stress fibers203Y1–16E6Subconfluence−Stress fibers100Confluence−Stress fibers24F2408Subconfluence−Stress fibers100Confluence−Stress fibers591-a ND, not determined.

The obtained RNAs were all analyzed for the cca1 mRNA level by RNase protection assay using a gapdh probe as a control. cca1 probe protects 372 nt of the mRNA as described in the legend of Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the association of cca1 mRNA accumulation with the confluent 3Y1-type growth pattern was causative or coincidental, the pLRNL-cca1, pLRNL-cca1(-atg), or pLRNL vector was introduced into 3Y1 BU, 3Y1 BU/pTK, 3Y1-16E6, and F2408 cells, and then the cells obtained were examined for restoration of the 3Y1-type growth pattern after reaching confluence by phalloidin staining and BrdUrd incorporation. The pLRNL-cca1 was designed to produce the entire CCA1 protein (635 aa; aa 1–635), whereas the pLRNL-cca1(-atg) was expected to give rise to an N-terminal deleted protein (222 aa; aa 414–635) translated from the second methionine (shownboxed in the amino acid sequence in Fig. 1). When the growth pattern of 3Y1 BU/pTK cells carrying pLRNL-cca1 (termed 3Y1 BU/pTK/pLRNL-cca1 cells for convenience, with the others also named similarly) was monitored by phalloidin staining, the confluent 3Y1 BU/pTK/pLRNL-cca1 cells changed their actin filament organization from predominantly actin stress fibers to mainly cortical actin filaments (a in Fig. 6 A), which was indistinguishable from that of the confluent 3Y1 cells (b in Fig. 4 B). Similar results were obtained in the cca1 cDNA-introduced 3Y1 BU cells (data not shown). In contrast, a consistent pattern of actin stress fibers was detected in the 3Y1 BU/pTK/pLRNL-cca1(-atg) (b in Fig. 6 A) and 3Y1 BU/pTK/pLRNL cells (c in Fig. 6 A), independent of their culture conditions. Similarly, no significant alternation of the actin filament organization was observed after introduction of cca1 cDNA into 3Y1-16E6 or F2408 cells (data not shown). When the growth patterns of the 3Y1 BU/pTK/pLRNL-cca1, the 3Y1 BU/pTK/pLRNL-cca1(-atg), and the 3Y1 BU/pTK/pLRNL cells were monitored by BrdUrd incorporation, almost all these cells in subconfluent culture were found to incorporate BrdUrd into their nuclei. After confluence, only 3% of the 3Y1 BU/pTK/pLRNL-cca1 cells were found to be BrdUrd-incorporating cells. In contrast, the values were 19% for the 3Y1 BU/pTK/pLRNL-cca1(-atg) cells and 20% for the 3Y1 BU/pTK/pLRNL cells, essentially the same as for 3Y1 BU/pTK cells (20%). Similarly, no significant decrease in the percentage of BrdUrd-incorporating cells after reaching confluence was observed on introduction of cca1 cDNA into 3Y1-16E6 or F2408 cells (data not shown). cca1 mRNA levels after reaching confluence were determined by the RNase protection assay with the cca1* probe additionally used to detect the mRNA transcribed from the exogenously introduced template, as well as the endogenous template. The amounts of cca1 mRNA in both 3Y1 BU/pTK/pLRNL-cca1 and 3Y1 BU/pTK/pLRNL-cca1(-atg) cells were estimated to be 10 times as much as in confluent 3Y1 cells (comparelanes 3 and 4 with lane 1 in Fig.6 B) and to be essentially the same in the cca1 cDNA-introduced cells derived from 3Y1 BU, 3Y1-16E6, or F2408 cells (data not shown). However, the anti-CCA1 antibodies we prepared failed to detect any specific proteins in 3Y1 BU/pTK/pLRNL-cca1 cells (data not shown). To study whether or not the cca1 cDNA might exert a growth suppressive effect on subconfluent cells, the doubling time of cca1 cDNA-introduced 3Y1 BU/pTK cells was compared with that of the unintroduced cells. No significant differences were observed (data not shown), indicating that cca1 cDNA in itself was not sufficient to suppress cell growth in subconfluent 3Y1 BU/pTK cells. cca1 cDNA fragment was previously isolated on the basis of preferential accumulation of the corresponding mRNA in growth-arrested confluent but not in growing subconfluent 3Y1 cells (6Hayashi Y. Kiyono T. Fujita M. Ishibashi M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1352: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Different from 3Y1 cell case, cca1 mRNA was found not to be detected in confluent 3Y1 BU, 3Y1 BU/pTK, 3Y1-16E6, or F2408 cells, whose growth patterns monitored by BrdUrd incorporation and phalloidin staining were different from that of the confluent 3Y1 cells (Table I). When cca1 cDNA was introduced into 3Y1 BU or 3Y1 BU/pTK cells, a restoration of the confluent 3Y1-type growth pattern was observed after reaching confluence. The results indicated that cca1 is required for formation of the growth-arrested monolayer of 3Y1 cells. However, the lack of any significant alternation of the growth pattern on introduction of cca1 cDNA into 3Y1-16E6 or F2408 cells and no significant growth suppressive effect of the cca1 cDNA on the subconfluent 3Y1 BU/pTK cells imply that the up-regulation of the other gene(s) may also be required for the influence to be exerted. Introduction of a first ATG-deleted cDNA into the 3Y1 BU/pTK cells failed to restore the confluent 3Y1-type growth pattern after reaching confluence. Because the cca1 mRNA level in the cells was almost the same as the level in the undeleted cca1 cDNA-introduced 3Y1 BU/pTK cells (Fig. 6 B), it was considered that not only the expression of cca1 mRNA corresponding to the ORF but also the production of the entire CCA1 protein were required for the biological activity. The cca1 mRNA was found to be ubiquitously distributed with different levels (Fig. 2), which were not necessarily consistent with their growth activities; it should be noted that heart harbored a low mRNA level, whereas jejunum with its high growth rate demonstrated the greatest amount of mRNA observed. Further examinations of cca1 mRNA level in the different types of cells in each organ are required to reveal association of the mRNA level with growth-arrested cell state in vivo. Mouse sarcoma cells transfected with a cDNA for the liver cell adhesion molecule change their morphology from round or spindle like form to a cobblestone-like form after reaching confluence by increasing the cell adhesiveness through the formation of adherens and gap junctions (16Mege R.M.

The mechanisms underlying the similar morphological changes observed in 3Y1 cells remain to be elucidated, but the present isolation of cca1 cDNA provides an important clue toward their elucidation. We are grateful to Dr. M. Tatematsu for generously providing total RNAs of several rat organs, C. Yamada for expert technical assistance, and Dr. K. Koike for helpful comments in the preparation of this manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2094740735,"The species and tissue specificity of apolipoprotein (apo) B mRNA editing is determined by the expression of apoB editing catalytic polypeptide 1 (APOBEC-1), the cytidine deaminase that catalyzes apoB mRNA editing. To understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate the transcription of APOBEC-1, we characterized rat APOBEC-1 cDNA and genomic DNA. cDNA cloning and RNase protection analysis showed two alternative promoters for the tissue-specific expression of APOBEC-1 in the liver and intestine, Pliv and Pint. Both promoters lack a TATA box, and Pint belongs to the MED-1 class of promoters, which initiate transcription at multiple sites. We also identified two allelic forms of the APOBEC-1 gene from the characterization of two rat APOBEC-1 P1 genomic clones, RE4 and RE5. The RE4 allele is 18 kilobases long and contains six exons and five introns, whereas the RE5 allele contains an additional ∼8 kilobases of intron sequences and an extra exon encoding a 5′-untranslated region; however, the APOBEC-1 transcripts from the two alleles appear to have similar, if not identical, functions. Transgenic mouse studies showed that Pliv was preferentially used in the liver, kidney, brain, and adipose tissues, whereas Pint was preferentially used in the small intestine, stomach, and lung. Our results suggest that the tissue-specific expression of APOBEC-1 is governed by multiple regulatory elements exerting control over a single coding sequence.

B mRNA, which is synthesized abundantly in the liver and intestine, encodes two forms of apoB protein that are crucial for lipoprotein metabolism (1Innerarity T.L. Borén J. Yamanaka S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2353-2356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The full-length apoB, apoB-100, is required for the synthesis and assembly of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) by the liver. VLDL are converted to low density lipoproteins (LDL) in which apoB-100, the sole apolipoprotein component of LDL, mediates the uptake and removal of LDL from the circulation by the LDL receptor pathway. Mutations in apoB-100 or in the LDL receptor that disrupt ligand-receptor interactions, resulting in high LDL cholesterol levels and an increased risk of atherosclerosis (2Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. Weisgraber K.H. Bersot T.P. Krauss R.M. Vega G.L. Grundy S.M. Friedl W. Davignon J. McCarthy B.J. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1337-1349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4284) Google Scholar). The second form of apoB, apoB-48, is essential for the synthesis and transport of large triglyceride-rich chylomicrons. ApoB-48 is generated from an apoB mRNA that has been modified by a unique post-transcriptional mechanism, namely apoB mRNA editing. A specific cytidine residue in apoB mRNA, C6666, is deaminated to a uridine. This C to U change generates an in-frame stop codon, which leads to the production of apoB-48, the amino-terminal 48% of apoB-100 (1Innerarity T.L. Borén J. Yamanaka S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2353-2356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). ApoB editing has both tissue and species specificity. The intestine of all mammals edit apo-B mRNA, but lower species such as avians and amphibians lack sequence determinants in their apoB sequence and editing activity in their intestines and synthesize only apoB-100. In some mammals, such as dogs, horses, mice, and rats, the liver also possesses editing activity (4Greeve J. Altkemper I. Dieterich J.-H. Greten H. Windler E. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1367-1383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All other mammals examined, including humans, synthesize only apoB-100 in the liver. The editing of apoB mRNA by the liver has important metabolic consequences. In mice and rats, VLDL-containing apoB-48 is not converted to LDL, and therefore in these species, the low levels of LDL and the resistance to hypercholesterolemia when fed a high-cholesterol, high-fat diet are partly due to the synthesis of apoB-48-containing VLDL (4Greeve J. Altkemper I. Dieterich J.-H. Greten H. Windler E. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1367-1383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The probable basis for this species- and tissue-specific expression of apoB mRNA editing was suggested by the identification of the cytidine deaminase that catalyzes this process, APOBEC-1, an acronym for apoB editing catalytic polypeptide1. APOBEC-1 alone is insufficient to catalyze apoB mRNA editing and requires auxiliary protein(s). Theoretically, the tissue and organ specificities could be determined by the expression of either APOBEC-1 or the auxiliary protein(s). However, auxiliary protein activity is found in most organs and tissue extracts, while APOBEC-1 is selectively expressed. In rabbits and humans, APOBEC-1 is mainly expressed in the small intestine, with low abundance in the colon (rabbit) and only trace amounts in other tissues (5Hadjiagapiou C. Giannoni F. Funahashi T.

In rats, APOBEC-1 mRNA is found at high levels in the spleen and small intestine and at lower levels in the liver, colon, kidney, and lung (8Teng B. Burant C.F. Davidson N.O. Science. 1993; 260: 1816-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). In mice, mRNA expression is highest in the small intestine, liver, and spleen, followed by the kidney, lung, muscle, and heart (9Nakamuta M. Oka K. Krushkal J. Kobayashi K. Yamamoto M. Li W.-H. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13042-13056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The reason for the species-specific differences in the expression of APOBEC-1 is not clear. It could relate to differences in transcriptional regulatory sequences of the APOBEC-1 gene from different species or in concentrations of the trans-acting protein factors acting on the APOBEC-1 gene in the livers and other tissues of different species. In addition to its tissue specificity, apoB mRNA editing is also regulated during development by hormones and diet (10Baum C.L. Teng B.-B. Davidson N.O. J. Biol.

Since APOBEC-1 is the key enzyme in apoB mRNA editing, the mechanism of APOBEC-1 gene expression has important functional implications. Discernment of the species- and tissue-specific regulation of APOBEC-1 expression could be significant for apoB lipoprotein metabolism. For example, if humans expressed low levels of APOBEC-1 in the liver, as do mice and rats, less apoB-100 VLDL would be synthesized, lowering plasma levels of LDL. To understand how species-specific, tissue-specific, developmental stage-specific, and hormonal regulatory signals of APOBEC-1 gene are integrated, it will be crucial to identify the cis-acting elements involved in each aspect of the regulatory mechanism. In the present studies, we identified two promoters involved in tissue-specific regulation of APOBEC-1 gene and tested their functions in transgenic mice. We also identified two allelic forms of the rat APOBEC-1 gene. Three P1 plasmid clones (RE4, RE5, and RE6) were identified by screening a rat P1 genomic library (Genome System) using primer sets R235 and R320 (the sequences of all oligonucleotides used in this study are shown in Table I). The insert size of the P1 plasmid clones was determined by restriction enzyme digestion atNotI and SalI sites in the vector. The existence of the rat APOBEC-1 gene in these clones was confirmed by Southern blotting with probes generated from rat APOBEC-1 cDNA (kindly provided by Dr. Donna Driscoll, Cleveland Clinic Foundation). To characterize the genomic structure of APOBEC-1 in RE4, severalBamHI genomic fragments derived from RE4, which hybridized to APOBEC-1 cDNA, were subcloned into the plasmid pBS.SK+. (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). One of these subclones, RE4.B2.0K, which contains Exon 2 and its flanking sequences, was used as a probe for the restriction fragment length polymorphism experiments. These genomic subclones, as well as the RE4 P1 genomic clone, were sequenced with primers corresponding to rat APOBEC-1 cDNA sequences. The number and size of exons and the positions of exon-intron junctions were determined by comparing genomic DNA and cDNA sequences. The distance between exons was determined by the extra-long (XL) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method (XL-PCR kit,CLONTECH) with exon-specific primers under the conditions suggested by the manufacturer and the following PCR program: 1 min at 94 °C; 16 cycles of 15 s at 94 °C, 10 min at 68 °C; 12 cycles of 15 s at 94 °C, 10 min at 68 °C with an auto extension of 20 s per cycle; 10 min at 72 °C. The promoter sequences were determined by oligonucleotide walking using aTaq Dye-Deoxy Terminator automatic sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems).Table IOligonucleotides used in this studyOligonucleotideSequence1-aAll sequence are shown 5′ to 3′.PositionM49-ratCTGAATGCATCTGACTGGGAGAGACAAGTAGCTGRat apoBM50-ratCGGATATGATACTGTTCGTCAAGCRat apoBL8.ACTCTGGGTAGTCTCTGATTTGTGGExon 1aL8.SCCACCAATCAGAGACTACCCAGAGExon 1aR235AACACCAGCTGCTCCATTACCTGGExon 4R320AAATAAACAGAGTTACATGGGGGTExon 4RE48.ATTCTGCCTTCAAAATCCAACTCTCExon 1RE48.SGAGAGTTGATTTTGAAGGCAGAAExon 1RE.PE-1TCGGAACTCATCTTGCTCTCTGTGTCTCTGGAExon 2RE.PI-9SGTTTAACCGTCACTCTGGAATTTPintRE.PL-2SGCTCTTGTCGGTTTGTGTCTGTPlivRE153ATTGGTGTTTTGGCTCGTGTGTCGCExon 4RE153SGCGACACACGAGCCAAAACACCAAExon 4RE4+5AGTTCTGGTGCTCTCTTCCTCTTGAPintRE5.DS-1TTCAGTTCTTGCCTTCACGTTTCTPintRE514ATACGTACAGCCTCACCCACAGATGExon 5RE514SCATCTGTGGGTGAGGCTGTACGTAExon 5RE644AGGATGTGGGGTGGTAGCCTTTGGTExon 6RE644SACCAAAGGCTACCACCCCACATCCExon 6REP.LGTGCCTACTCCCGCTACAGAACCAExon 1REP.L-ICCGAGGAAGGAGTCCAGAGACACAExon 41-a All sequence are shown 5′ to 3′. Open table in a new tab The structures of the RE5 and RE6 genomic clones were determined by restriction mapping and XL-PCR analysis. The intestinal promoter sequence and the sequence 5′ of the promoter in RE5 were determined by sequencing a 6.5-kilobase (kb) XhoI fragment subcloned into pBS.SK+. Exon 1a was located by subcloning a 4.7-kbXhoI/BamHI fragment into pZero vector (Invitrogen) and analyzing the subclone by XL-PCR. XL-PCR was used to determine the genomic structure of the RE5-type APOBEC-1 gene 5′ to Exon 1a. The distance between Exon 1 and Exon 1a was determined by direct PCR amplification of Lewis rat genomic DNA with primers hybridizing to these two exons (REP.L, L8-A) using the Expand Long Template PCR system (Boehringer Mannheim) with the following modification. To achieve optimal amplification of these genomic fragments, we used PCR Buffer 1 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.2, 16 mm (NH4)2SO4, 1.75 mm MgCl2) provided with this kit and added dimethyl sulfoxide to a final concentration of 4% in the reaction. Lewis rat genomic DNA (200 ng) was used as the template. After 1 min at 94 °C, the PCR reaction was performed for 10 cycles of 10 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, 8 min at 68 °C; 20 cycles of 10 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, 8 min at 68 °C, with an extension of 20 s at 68 °C in each cycle. A final 10-min extension at 68 °C was added after the last cycle. The genomic sequences immediately upstream of Exon 1 and Exon 2 of the Lewis rat APOBEC-1 gene were cloned by conventional Taq PCR with primers derived from the RE4 and RE5 genomic clones (RE.PL-2S and RE48A; RE5.DS-1 and RE4+5.A) and directly ligated into pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen), and their sequences were determined by automatic sequencing. Sprague-Dawley, Fischer, and Lewis rat tails were obtained from Harlan Sprague-Dawley. Genomic DNA was extracted after proteinase K digestion. Additional Sprague-Dawley genomic DNA samples were obtained fromCLONTECH. The genomic DNA was digested withBamHI. Randomly primed DNA probes were generated from RE4.B2.0K and used for Southern blot analysis. Total RNA was prepared from rat and transgenic mouse tissues by homogenizing tissues in RNA STAT-60 total RNA/mRNA isolation reagent (Tel-Test “B,” Inc.) followed by chloroform extraction. For Northern blot analysis of rat APOBEC-1, a cDNA fragment containing the entire coding sequence of rat APOBEC-1 was used to generate randomly labeled probes. Total RNA (20 μg) from different rat tissues was fractionated on a 1% agarose/formamide gel and transferred to a nylon membrane. The blot was first hybridized to a 32P-labeled APOBEC-1 probe to detect APOBEC-1 mRNA and then stripped and reprobed with a32P-labeled glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) probe. The riboprobe APOBEC-5′ is a 5′ RACE product cloned in a pBS.SK+ plasmid, containing sequences from 8 to 318 nucleotides (nt) of the liver transcript. Linearization of this plasmid at the EcoRI site and transcription with T7 polymerase generated a 340-nt riboprobe. pGEM3.REP (a gift from Dr. Donna Driscoll) contains the entire coding sequence of rat APOBEC-1, 33 nt of 5′-UTR, and 50 nt of 3′-UTR. Digestion of this plasmid at theSspI site and transcription by SP6 polymerase generated a 230-nt riboprobe, APOBEC-3′, which protects a 202-nt fragment at the 3′ end of APOBEC-1 mRNA. A genomic fragment containing 118 bp of Exon 2 and 203 bp of its 5′-flanking sequence was cloned by PCR with primers RE.PI.9S and RE.PE-1. The resulting 321-bp PCR product was cloned into a pCR2.1 vector. Transcription of the plasmid linearized at aBamHI site in the vector with T7 polymerase generated the riboprobe Int.St for the mapping of intestinal start site of APOBEC-1. A 230-nt GAPDH probe was generated by digestion of the plasmid pTRI-GAPDH-mouse (Ambion) with DdeI followed by transcription with SP6 polymerase. Antisense riboprobes were synthesized by in vitro transcription in the presence of [α-32P]cytidine 5′-triphosphate (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham). A total of 40 μg of RNA was coprecipitated with 1–5 × 105 of radiolabeled riboprobe. The substrate and probe RNA were redissolved in 30 μl of hybridization buffer (80% formamide, 40 mm PIPES, pH 6.4, 200 mm sodium acetate, and 1 mm EDTA), denatured at 85 °C for 3 min, and hybridized at 60 °C for 18 h. The unhybridized RNAs were digested with 10 units of RNase ONE (Promega) in 300 μl of RNase ONE digestion buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 200 mm sodium acetate) for 1 h at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by adding 30 μl of Stop Solution (10% SDS, 1.0 mg/ml yeast tRNA), and the protected RNA fragments were precipitated by ethanol and analyzed on a 6 or 8% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gel, followed by autoradiography. Specific protected RNA fragments were quantitated by Scanalytics Ambis Radioisotopic Imaging System. Final values were expressed as a ratio of APOBEC-1/GAPDH to correct for differences in RNA content. First-strand cDNA was generated from DNase I-treated total rat RNA by reverse transcription with Superscript RT (Life Technologies). Random primers were used for reverse transcription except in 3′ RACE, where an oligo(dT)-containing adapter primer (Life Technologies) was used to prime the synthesis of cDNA. After RNase H digestion, one-tenth of the reverse transcription reaction was used directly for PCR amplification except for the 5′ RACE (see below). The resulting PCR products were analyzed on agarose gels and directly cloned to PCR II vector by TA cloning unless otherwise specified. To map the 5′ end of the rat intestinal APOBEC-1 by 5′ RACE, the cDNAs was purified with GlassMAX Spin Cartridge (Life Technologies) and modified by adding a polydeoxycytidine sequence to the 3′ end with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. cDNA clones representing the 5′ termini of APOBEC-1 were amplified by PCR with an anchor primer that hybridized to the poly(dC) sequence and with antisense APOBEC-1 primers (RE514A and RE153A) in two sequential nested PCR reactions. The 5′ end of rat liver APOBEC-1 cDNA was cloned from rat liver 5′-RACE ReadyTM cDNA (CLONTECH). PCR was performed with 2 μl of cDNA, the 5′ anchor primer, and APOBEC-1 antisense primer RE514A for the primary reaction and RE153A for the secondary reaction. The resulting PCR products were cloned into pBS.SK+ vector. The 3′ terminus of APOBEC-1 was determined by 3′ RACE. Oligo(dT)-primed cDNA was amplified with an antisense primer hybridizing to the oligo(dT) anchor primer and sense primers hybridizing to rat APOBEC-1 gene (RE153S). Exon 1a and alternatively spliced forms of APOBEC-1 were cloned by reverse transcriptase-PCR from Lewis rat liver RNA with a sense primer hybridized to Exon 1 (REP.L) and an antisense primer hybridized to Exon 4 (RE153A). The expression of Exon 1a in rats with different APOBEC-1 genotypes and in transgenic mice was determined by reverse transcriptase-PCR with REP.L primer and a 32P-labeled RE153A primer. P1 plasmids containing either rat APOBEC-1 genomic sequence RE4 or RE5 were digested with SalI andNotI to release the genomic insert. The 52-kb RE4 and 78-kb RE5 inserts were separated from the vector sequence on 1% low-melting-point agarose gels by pulsed field gel electrophoresis using the Bio-Rad CHEF-PRIII system. These fragments were purified by gelase (Epicenter) digestion and dialyzed against Microinjection Buffer P (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 30 μm spermine, 70 μmspermidine). The constructs were injected into F2 C57/BL6XSJL murine zygotes at a concentration of 2–3 ng/μl. Transgenic mice were identified by Southern blot analysis with APOBEC-1 cDNA probe. Three independent lines of transgenic mice for each construct were established, and the expression of rat APOBEC-1 was determined by RNase protection assay with APOBEC-3′ riboprobe. Primer extension of apoB was carried out essentially as described previously with the following modification (14Yamanaka S. Balestra M.E. Ferrell L.D. Fan J. Arnold K.S. Taylor S. Taylor J.M. Innerarity T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8483-8487Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The rat and mouse liver cDNA were prepared by reverse transcription with Superscript reverse transcriptase. The primers used to amplify rat and mouse apoB were M49-rat and M50-rat and M49-mouse and M50-mouse. Plasma samples from Lewis or Fisher rats fasted for 6 h were analyzed for lipoprotein contents by agarose gel electrophoresis, ultracentrifugation followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, anti-apoB Western blot, and fast protein liquid chromatography, as described previously (14Yamanaka S. Balestra M.E. Ferrell L.D. Fan J. Arnold K.S. Taylor S. Taylor J.M. Innerarity T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8483-8487Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). To determine the structure of the rat APOBEC-1 gene and its regulatory sequences, we obtained three bacteriophage P1 genomic clones by the PCR screening of a Sprague-Dawley rat genomic library. The sizes of the DNA inserts in these P1 clones, as determined by SalI/NotI digestion, are: RE4, 52 kb; RE5, 78 kb; and RE6, 86 kb (Fig.1 A). The presence of the APOBEC-1 gene in these genomic clones was confirmed by Southern blot analysis with a full-length rat APOBEC-1 cDNA probe. The shortest clone, RE4, was chosen for further characterization of the genomic structure of the rat APOBEC-1 gene. The exon-intron organization and the exon-intron junctions of the APOBEC-1 gene were determined by direct DNA sequencing of the RE4 P1 plasmid and its subclones with a series of oligonucleotides spanning the length of APOBEC-1 cDNA. Intron length was determined by XL-PCR (XL-PCR) amplification of genomic clones with primers that hybridized to the 5′ and 3′ exon sequence flanking the introns. These results yielded the APOBEC-1 genomic structure diagrammed in Fig. 1 B. Table IIdisplays a summary of the sizes of the exons and introns. The RE4 rat APOBEC-1 gene contained six exons and five introns, spanning a total of 18 kb. The RE4 P1 plasmid contained 3.8 kb of 5′ sequence and 30 kb of 3′ sequence flanking the APOBEC-1 gene. Restriction mapping with a rare-cutting endonuclease Sfi showed that RE5 and RE6 clones contain more 3′ sequences flanking the APOBEC-1 gene than RE4. At the 3′ end, RE5 and RE6 are 22 and 21 kb longer than RE4, respectively (Fig. 1 A). At the 5′ end, RE6 is 4 kb longer than RE4. Although RE5 appears to have more 5′-flanking sequence, as will be described, it is a longer allelic form of the rat APOBEC-1 gene, and the RE5 P1 clone is missing the first exon of the rat APOBEC-1 gene.Table IIExon-intron organization of the rat APOBEC-1 geneExonLengthNucleotideAmino acidFeatureIntronLengthbpkb11121 –112Noncoding12-aThis intron is found in the RE4-type allele, but not in the RE5-type allele, of the rat APOBEC-1 gene.4.21a2-bThese exon and introns are found in the RE5-type allele, but not in the RE4-types allele, of the APOBEC-1 gene.147RE5-type1.1a2-bThese exon and introns are found in the RE5-type allele, but not in the RE4-types allele, of the APOBEC-1 gene.62122113 –2341 –6Start codon1a.22-bThese exon and introns are found in the RE5-type allele, but not in the RE4-types allele, of the APOBEC-1 gene.6.4328235 –2626 –15234398263 –66015 –148Catalytic, RNA binding385120661 –780149 –188Leucine-rich motif40.56229781 –1009189 –229Stop codon522-a This intron is found in the RE4-type allele, but not in the RE5-type allele, of the rat APOBEC-1 gene.2-b These exon and introns are found in the RE5-type allele, but not in the RE4-types allele, of the APOBEC-1 gene. Open table in a new tab The previously published rat APOBEC-1 intestinal cDNA sequence contains 30 bp of 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) and 105 bp of 3′-UTR (8Teng B. Burant C.F. Davidson N.O. Science. 1993; 260: 1816-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Because liver APOBEC-1 mRNA (∼1.2 kb) is significantly larger than intestinal mRNA (∼1.0 kb) (6Yamanaka S. Poksay K.S. Balestra M.E. Zeng G.-Q. Innerarity T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21725-21734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) it seemed likely that the rat liver APOBEC-1 mRNA contains additional 5′- or 3′-untranslated sequences. We used 5′ and 3′ RACE and RNase protection analysis to analyze the APOBEC-1 transcripts from the liver and small intestine of the Sprague-Dawley rat. Using 5′ RACE, we compared the 5′-UTR of rat liver APOBEC-1 cDNAs with that of the published rat intestinal APOBEC-1 cDNA (8Teng B. Burant C.F. Davidson N.O. Science. 1993; 260: 1816-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar) and found that the rat liver APOBEC-1 cDNAs contained additional 5′-UTR nucleotides. These results suggest that the longer rat liver APOBEC-1 transcripts are initiated by a unique liver promoter located upstream of the intestinal promoter. We performed RNase protection analysis using the riboprobes depicted in Fig. 2 A to investigate the longer and shorter forms of APOBEC-1 transcripts expressed in the liver and small intestine of Sprague-Dawley rats. The antisense riboprobe APOBEC-5′ allowed us to distinguish between the two forms of APOBEC-1 transcripts. The antisense riboprobe APOBEC-3′ protects the same fragments in both forms of APOBEC-1 mRNA. Consistent with the previous findings by Teng et al. (8Teng B. Burant C.F. Davidson N.O. Science. 1993; 260: 1816-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar), rat APOBEC-1 was expressed abundantly in the small intestine and at a lower level in the liver (Fig. 2 B, APOBEC-3′). The majority of the liver transcripts were in the longer form, represented by the protected fragment of 310 bp, whereas only a very small amount of intestinal APOBEC-1 transcripts was in the longer form (Fig. 2 B, APOBEC-5′). Four predominant fragments ranging from 210 to 150 nt were protected by the APOBEC-1 mRNA from the rat small intestine (Fig. 2 B). To investigate the origin of these intestinal transcripts, we performed 5′ RACE-PCR using rat intestinal RNA as a substrate. Eight different clones were analyzed. The transcriptional start sites of the clones are shown in Fig. 3 A. Two clones started in Intron 1 with the longer clone starting 59 bp upstream from the beginning of Exon 2. Six clones had start sites in Exon 2 sequences, which may account for the protected bands between 150 and 180 nt observed in the RNase protection assay. Therefore, we demonstrated that the intestinal APOBEC-1 promoter initiates promiscuous transcription at multiple sites. The transcription initiation sites for the intestinal APOBEC-1 mRNA transcripts were collectively called Pint. The base encoding the first nucleotide of the longest intestinal transcript was designated as +1.Figure 3Rat APOBEC-1 gene promoter sequences and transcriptional start sites.

The liver transcripts are initiated at three separate and distinct sites at the beginning of Exon 1 (Fig. 3 B). The promoter located at the beginning of Exon 1 was designated Pliv, since it is preferentially used in the liver. Thus, these results suggest that two distinct promoters, Pint and Pliv, are used to direct the tissue-specific expression of the rat APOBEC-1 gene. We determined the sequence of ∼670 bp of the 5′-flanking sequence of Pint (Fig. 3 A) and ∼1 kb of 5′-f"
https://openalex.org/W2016334878,"Investigation of the comparative activities of various inhibitors of farnesyl:protein transferase (FPTase) has led to the observation that the presence of phosphate or pyrophosphate ions in the assay buffer increases the potency of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) competitive inhibitors. In addition to exploring the phenomenon of phosphate synergy, we report here the effects of various other ions including sulfate, bicarbonate, and chloride on the inhibitory ability of three FPP competitive compounds: Cbz-His-Tyr-Ser(OBn)TrpNH<sub>2</sub> (2), Cbz-HisTyr(OPO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>)-Ser(OBn)TrpNH<sub>2</sub>(3), and α-hydroxyfarnesyl phosphonic acid (4). Detailed kinetic analysis of FPTase inhibition revealed a high degree of synergy for compound 2 and each of these ions. Phosphorylation of 2 to give 3 completely eliminated any ionic synergistic effect. Moreover, these ions have an antagonistic effect on the inhibitory potency of compound 4. The anions in the absence of inhibitor exhibit non-competitive inhibition with respect to FPP. These results suggest that phosphate, pyrophosphate, bicarbonate, sulfate, and chloride ions may be binding at the active site of both free enzyme and product-bound enzyme with normal substrates. These bound complexes increase the potency of FPP competitive inhibitors and mimic an enzyme:product form of the enzyme. None of the anions studied here proved to be synergistic with respect to inhibition of geranylgeranyl transferase I. These findings provide insight into the mechanism of action of FPP competitive inhibitors for FPTase and point to enzymatic differences between FPTase and geranylgeranyl transferase I that may facilitate the design of more potent and specific inhibitors for these therapeutically relevant target enzymes."

In addition, purified chaperonin from Paracoccus denitrificansis a mixture of a large number of tetradecamers and a small number of heptamers (10Ishii N. Taguchi H. Sumi M. Yoshida M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 299: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The physiological meaning of such a divergence in the quarternary structure of chaperonin has not been understood. Recently, we found that when T.holo-cpn is incubated with ATP and K+, it splits into two parts at the equator plane between the two rings of Tcpn607, producing cone-shaped particles (Tcpn607·Tcpn107) and ring-shaped particles probably corresponding to Tcpn607 (17Ishii N. Taguchi H. Sasabe H. Yoshida M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Then we observed that the products of the split reaction can reassociate to form T.holo-cpn under the appropriate conditions (18Yamakoshi M. Taguchi H. Ishii N. Yoshida M. Structure and Function of Molecular Chaperones.in: Fink A.L. Goto Y. Marcel Dekker Inc., 1997Google Scholar). In contrast to the split reaction, Todd et al. (14Todd M.J. Walke S. Lorimer G. Truscott K. Scopes R.K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14932-14941Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) reported that the single-ring T. brockii cpn607 dimerizes to form a double-ring structure in the presence of T. brockiicpn107 and ATP. These results raise the question of whether GroEL14 also undergoes the tetradecamer-heptamer transition. Here, we report that when GroEL14 and T.holo-cpn are incubated with ATP and KCl, hybrid chaperonins such as GroEL7·Tcpn607·Tcpn107 are formed as a result of the heptamer exchange reaction. This suggests that ATP/K+-dependent transient dissociation of a tetradecamer into heptamers occurs not only in Thermuschaperonin but also in GroEL. Isopropylmalate dehydrogenase (IPMDH) from T. thermophilus strain HB8 was a kind gift from Dr. T. Oshima and his colleagues (Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Science, Hachioji, Japan) (19Yamada T. Akutsu N. Miyazaki K. Kakinuma K. Yoshida M. Oshima T. J. Biochem. 1990; 108: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). (2R*,3S*)-3-Isopropylmalic acid, a substrate of IPMDH, was purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Corp. T.holo-cpn was purified as described previously (9Taguchi H. Konishi J. Ishii N. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22411-22418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Taguchi, H., and Yoshida, M. (1997) Methods Enzymol. in press.Google Scholar). Tcpn6014expressed in E. coli was purified using modifications of procedures described previously (12Amada K. Yohda M. Odaka M. Endo I. Ishii N. Taguchi H. Yoshida M. J. Biochem. 1995; 118: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The lysate of E. colicells containing expressed Tcpn6014 was heated at 70 °C for 20 min. The supernatant containing Tcpn6014 was recovered by centrifugation and applied to a hydrophobic interaction chromatography (Butyl-Toyopearl). The fractions containing Tcpn6014 were pooled and concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation. The concentrated protein solution was applied to a gel permeation HPLC column (G3000SWXL; Tosoh) equilibrated with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 100 mmNa2SO4, and 20% (v/v) methanol. The fractions containing Tcpn6014 were further purified by a DEAE-5PW HPLC column. Tcpn107 expressed in E. coli was purified as described previously (12Amada K. Yohda M. Odaka M. Endo I. Ishii N. Taguchi H. Yoshida M. J. Biochem. 1995; 118: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). GroEL14 and GroES7 were purified as described previously (21Murai N. Makino Y. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28229-28234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) from the lysate of E. coli cells bearing the multicopy plasmid pACYC 184 carrying groES-groEL genes, which was a kind gift from Dr. K. Ito (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan) (22Ito K. Akiyama Y. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2243-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A mutant GroELAEX14 (C138S, C458S, C519S, D83C, and K327C) was purified as described previously (21Murai N. Makino Y. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28229-28234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Purified chaperonins were stored as a suspension in 65% ammonium sulfate at 4 °C. T.holo-cpn or Tcpn6014 (5 μg) was mixed (final volume, 10 μl) with GroEL14 (5 μg) and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min in Buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2) containing 1 mmATP, unless otherwise indicated. The sample solutions were applied to nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (6% acrylamide), and electrophoresis was continued for about double the duration of the period required for the leading dye (bromphenol blue) to reach the front of the gel. The protein bands were stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Only the regions of the chaperonin protein bands are shown in the figures. The ammonium sulfate precipitate of the mixture of parent and hybrid chaperonins was solubilized in a minimum volume of Buffer B (25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 5 mm MgCl2) and applied to a Sephadex G-25 (Pharmacia) column to remove the excessive salts. The eluted protein solution was applied to a DEAE-5PW (Tosoh) column equilibrated with Buffer B and eluted with a 0–1.0 m NaCl gradient at 1 ml/min. The chromatography was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm. ATPase activities were assayed by measuring the amount of produced inorganic phosphate (23Geladopoulos T.P. Sotiroudis T.G. Evangelopoulos A.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Typically, the reaction was started by the addition of ATP (final concentration, 1 mm) to Buffer A containing 0.88 μm 2Concentrations of chaperonins are expressed as those of the indicated forms of the oligomer complexes. GroEL14 or Tcpn6014 and, when indicated, 1.3 μmGroES7 or Tcpn107. The assay solution was preincubated for 10 min at 37 °C before the addition of ATP. The reactions were terminated by the addition of perchloric acid after incubations at 37 °C for 5, 10, 15, and 20 min. The solution was treated with a malachite green reagent, and the absorbance at 630 nm was measured. One unit of activity is defined as the activity that hydrolyzes 1 μmol of ATP/min. IPMDH (16.2 μm) denatured in 6.4 m guanidine HCl was diluted 25-fold at 37 °C in Buffer A containing the components indicated in the figure legends. After a 20-min incubation at 37 °C, an aliquot was withdrawn, and the reactivated IPMDH activity was determined as described previously (9Taguchi H. Konishi J. Ishii N. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22411-22418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford with bovine serum albumin as a standard (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216412) Google Scholar). Proteins were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis either on a 10% polyacrylamide gel in the presence of SDS (SDS-PAGE) or on 6% polyacrylamide gels without SDS (native PAGE) (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar). To obtain higher resolution on the native PAGE, electrophoresis was continued for about double the duration of the period required for the leading dye (bromphenol blue) to reach the front of the gel. Gels were stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. After we found the T.holo-cpn split (17Ishii N. Taguchi H. Sasabe H. Yoshida M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we attempted to identify the heptameric state of GroEL under various conditions but had no success. If GroEL14 splits only transiently in its ATPase cycle, we could not detect the heptamer GroEL by the usual methods. Then we used Thermus chaperonin as a trap for GroEL7, that is, we incubated GroEL14 with ATP/K+ in the presence of T.holo-cpn and examined whether the hybrid chaperonin containing GroEL7 and Tcpn607 was formed. We took advantage of the different electrophoretic mobility of GroEL14 and T.holo-cpn in native PAGE (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1–5) to identify the hybrid. As shown in Fig. 1 A, lane 6, two closely moving bands appeared between T.holo-cpn and GroEL14 when they were incubated with ATP/K+. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequences of the two bands confirmed that the upper band contained GroEL, Tcpn60, and Tcpn10 and that the lower band contained GroEL and Tcpn60 (data not shown). Yields of phenylthiohydantoin derivatives from GroEL, Tcpn60, and Tcpn10 (upper band) were generally close to each other, indicating that the upper and lower bands corresponded to GroEL7·Tcpn607·Tcpn107 and GroEL7·Tcpn607, respectively. As described later, an analysis of isolated hybrid chaperonins supported the structures described above. For these hybrids to be formed, heptamer exchange reactions should occur, that is, both T.holo-cpn and GroEL14 should split into heptamers that then rebind each other with a random combination into tetradecamers. Hereafter, we term the hybrid chaperonins as follows: GroEL7·Tcpn607·Tcpn107, Hybrid (EL-60–10); and GroEL7·Tcpn607, Hybrid (EL-60). 3The term Hybrid (EL-60–10) does not necessarily mean that Tcpn107 is attached to the Tcpn607ring in the hybrid. Although several lines of preliminary results, such as the protease sensitivity of each ring in the hybrid and the relatively weak affinity of Tcpn107 to GroEL14, suggest that Tcpn107 is at the Tcpn607 ring side, we cannot exclude the possibility that some Tcpn107is at the GroEL7 ring side. The conditions required for the formation of hybrid chaperonins were the same as those required for the split reaction of T.holo-cpn (17Ishii N. Taguchi H. Sasabe H. Yoshida M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar); formation was absolutely dependent on ATP and K+, and other combinations such as adenosine 5′-(β, γ-imino) triphosphate + K+ (Fig. 1 A, lane 7), adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) + K+ (data not shown), ADP + K+ (lane 8), and ATP + Na+(lane 10) were not effective in generating hybrids. When free Mg2+ was removed by trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexanetetraacetic acid, no hybrid was formed (lane 9). The relatively high concentrations of ATP and K+ were necessary. The hybrid formation was half-maximal at ∼50 μm ATP and ∼50 mm K+ and saturated at ∼300 μm ATP and ∼300 mmK+ (Fig. 1, B and C). The addition of excess Tcpn107 to the reaction mixture resulted in an increased yield of hybrid chaperonins with a simultaneous decrease of T.holo-cpn (Fig. 1 D, lane 2), but the addition of GroES7 had only little, if any (lane 3), effect. The hybrids were formed rapidly. In 1 min (Fig. 1 E,lane 5), hybrids with an amount similar to that formed in 10 min (lane 6) were detected, and a significant amount of hybrids was formed even in 20 s (lane 4). That is as fast as a single ATPase turnover in the GroEL catalytic cycle (6Todd M.J. Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G.H. Science. 1994; 265: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). The ATPase activity of Thermus chaperonin at 37 °C, the temperature at which hybrid formation was observed, is very low (see Fig. 5); hydrolysis of a single ATP molecule by Tcpn6014takes ∼15 s. Nevertheless, hybrid chaperonin was formed within 20 s. This result means that only the hydrolysis of a single ATP by Tcpn6014 is sufficient to form the hybrid chaperonins. This rapid formation of hybrid might be related to the observation that the formation of a tetradecamer from T. brockiicpn607 is also very rapid, occurring before all the cpn60 subunits could hydrolyze ATP (14Todd M.J. Walke S. Lorimer G. Truscott K. Scopes R.K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14932-14941Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Although the real reason why the hybrid was formed in such a short period is not known, one of the possible explanations is that the initial single turnover by one cpn60 in the tetradecamer might induce a quarternary structural change in the double ring of cpn607 in the presence of a high concentration of K+. To know whether cpn10 is required for hybrid formation or not, next we used Tcpn6014 instead of T.holo-cpn as one of the parent chaperonins. Tcpn6014 was isolated from recombinantE. coli (12Amada K. Yohda M. Odaka M. Endo I. Ishii N. Taguchi H. Yoshida M. J. Biochem. 1995; 118: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and we confirmed that Tcpn6014also split in the presence of ATP/K+. 4Unpublished observations. The hybrid chaperonin was formed between Tcpn6014 and GroEL14 in the presence of ATP/K+ (Fig. 2, lane 6). Unlike the experiment using T.holo-cpn, only a single band appeared between the parent chaperonins. As expected, this band was indeed Hybrid (EL-60), because NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing showed that the band contained an almost equal amount of Tcpn60 and GroEL. It is likely that in the experiments described in Fig. 1, Hybrid (EL-60) was formed at first, and Hybrid (EL-60–10) was generated next by attaching Tcpn107 to Hybrid (EL-60). In spite of the fact that the condition required for hybrid formation as described above was the same condition required for the split reaction of Thermus chaperonin (17Ishii N. Taguchi H. Sasabe H. Yoshida M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 18Yamakoshi M. Taguchi H. Ishii N. Yoshida M. Structure and Function of Molecular Chaperones.in: Fink A.L. Goto Y. Marcel Dekker Inc., 1997Google Scholar), there was no direct evidence of a requirement for ATP hydrolysis by GroEL14 for hybrid formation. To address the question, we used a GroEL mutant called GroELAEX instead of the wild-type GroEL as a parent chaperonin (21Murai N. Makino Y. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28229-28234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). GroELAEX is a mutant in which apical and equatorial domains in the same GroEL subunit can be cross-linked in a reversible manner (apical-equatorial cross (X)-link) (21Murai N. Makino Y. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28229-28234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In the presence of a reducing reagent, GroELAEX14 retains normal functional activity as a chaperonin. In contrast, oxidized GroELAEX14, which is locked in a “closed” conformation by an interdomain disulfide bond, can bind but not hydrolyze ATP (21Murai N. Makino Y. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28229-28234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Therefore, the requirement for ATP hydrolysis of GroEL14 in the hybrid formation would be tested in the presence or absence of a reducing reagent. Note that theThermus chaperonins have no cysteine residue (12Amada K. Yohda M. Odaka M. Endo I. Ishii N. Taguchi H. Yoshida M. J. Biochem. 1995; 118: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Just like wild-type GroEL14, the hybrid chaperonin was formed from GroELAEX14 and Tcpn6014 in an ATP/K+-dependent manner under reducing conditions (Fig. 3, lane 6). However, the hybrid was not formed under the oxidizing condition (lane 2), whereas the ATPase activity of GroELAEX14 was completely blocked (21Murai N. Makino Y. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28229-28234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Wild-type GroEL14 was able to form the hybrid with Tcpn6014, irrespective of reducing or oxidizing conditions (lanes 4 and 8). The inability of oxidized GroELAEX14 to form hybrid chaperonin indicates that ATP binding is not sufficient for hybrid formation and that the occurrence of ATP hydrolysis on GroEL14 is essential for hybrid formation. The hybrid between GroEL14 and Thermus chaperonins was separated from the parent chaperonins with anion-exchange HPLC (Fig. 4, A and B). The hybrid chaperonin fraction contained Hybrid (EL-60–10) and Hybrid (EL-60) (see Fig. 7 A, lane 5). In a similar manner, Hybrid (EL-60) was also purified (see Fig. 7 A, lane 4). The relative staining intensities of the GroEL band and the Tcpn60 band in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4, inset, lanes 1and 2) were almost the same, again confirming that the hybrid chaperonins consisted of equal molar amounts of each chaperonin subunit. The molecular sizes of the isolated hybrid chaperonins were the same or very close to those of the parent chaperonins, because they were eluted from a gel-permeation HPLC column at the same retention time as that of GroEL14 (data not shown). When hybrid chaperonins formed from GroEL14 and T.holo-cpn were examined by electron micrograph, two kinds of particles, GroEL14-like rectangular particles and bullet-shaped particles similar to T.holo-cpn, were observed (data not shown). Hybrid (EL-60) hydrolyzed ATP at 0.09 unit/mg−1 at 37 °C (Fig.5). Because T.holo-cpn and Tcpn6014hydrolyzed ATP very slowly at 37 °C (∼0.002 unit/mg−1), the ATPase activity of Hybrid (EL-60) would be mainly attributed to hydrolysis by the GroEL7 ring moiety in the hybrid. The hybrids produced from GroEL14 and T.holo-cpn, a mixture of Hybrid (EL-60–10) and Hybrid (EL-60), exhibited ATPase activity at 0.08 unit/mg−1. As reported for GroEL14 (e.g., Ref. 26Todd M.J. Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8560-8567Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), the addition of GroES7 or Tcpn107 inhibited the ATPase activity of GroEL14 (35–40% inhibition). The ATPase activity of the hybrid chaperonins was also inhibited by GroES7 and Tcpn107 (55–60% inhibition for Hybrid (EL-60), and ∼30% inhibition for the mixture of Hybrid (EL-60–10) and Hybrid (EL-60)).Figure 7The stability of hybrid chaperonins under various conditions. A and B, isolated hybrid chaperonins (4 μg of each) were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min in Buffer A in the absence (A) or presence (B) of 1 mm ATP. C, isolated hybrid chaperonins (4 μg of each) were incubated at 70 °C for 10 min in Buffer A.D, isolated hybrid chaperonins (4 μg of each) were treated with 0.2 μg of proteinase K at 25 °C in Buffer A. After a 30-min incubation, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (final concentration, 5 mm) was added to stop the proteolysis. Sample solutions were analyzed with 6% native PAGE as described in the legend to Fig.1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We examined the effect of hybrid chaperonins on the folding of IPMDH from T. thermophilus under a condition in which the yield of spontaneous folding was only ∼10% (Fig. 6). The following experiments were carried out in the presence of ATP. Under this condition, GroEL14 alone hardly promoted reactivation (less than 10% reactivation of IPMDH activity), and GroES7 was required for effective GroEL-promoted folding. Tcpn107 was as effective as GroES7 in this GroEL-promoted folding assay. In contrast to GroEL14, Tcpn6014 alone was able to promote folding of IPMDH (∼35%). Further addition of Tcpn107 increased the yield of reactivation about twice, whereas the effect of GroES7 was only marginal. Similar to GroEL14, Hybrid (EL-60) alone had almost no effect on folding (less than 10%), and the addition of GroES7 or Tcpn107 was required for effective folding (80–90%). In the case of the mixture of Hybrid (EL-60–10) and Hybrid (EL-60), the folding of IPMDH was promoted moderately (∼35%) even in the absence of GroES7 or Tcpn107, probably due to the endogenous presence of Tcpn107. The inclusion of GroES7 or Tcpn107 in the solution caused additional promotion of folding (50–60%). Thus, it is clear that both Hybrid (EL-60) and Hybrid (EL-60–10) are active in promoting protein folding. The isolated hybrid chaperonins were very stable. After storage at 4 °C for 3 weeks, about 90% of the hybrid chaperonins were still in the hybrid forms (data not shown). To investigate whether the two heptamer rings of hybrid chaperonins could reexchange each other in the presence of ATP/K+, we incubated the hybrid chaperonins with ATP/K+ and analyzed them by native PAGE. As shown in Fig. 7 B, regeneration of the parent chaperonins, GroEL14 and T.holo-cpn (or Tcpn6014), was not observed, irrespective of whether Hybrid (EL-60) or Hybrid (EL-60–10) was used as a starting hybrid chaperonin. Further addition of either GroES7 or Tcpn107 did not change the result (data not shown). This result was unexpected, because if the hybrid chaperonin split in the presence of ATP/K+, as observed for Thermuschaperonin, parent chaperonins should be regenerated more or less as a result of random reassociation of heptamers. Then we examined the effects of heat (70 °C for 10 min) or proteinase K treatment on the stability of the hybrid chaperonins. As shown in Fig. 7, Cand D, Thermus chaperonin was resistant to both treatments under the conditions tested, whereas GroEL was destroyed. After the isolated hybrid chaperonins were incubated at 70 °C for 10 min, the hybrid chaperonins disappeared completely, andThermus chaperonin but not GroEL14 appeared (Fig. 7 C, lanes 4 and 5). Treatment with proteinase K also gave the same results (Fig. 7 D,lanes 4 and 5). These results indicate that only when the GroEL7 moiety of the hybrid is denatured or proteolyzed, survived heptamer rings of Tcpn60 can reassociate to form Tcpn6014 or T.holo-cpn. In this report, we demonstrated ATP/K+-dependent formation of the hybrid between GroEL14 andThermus chaperonin. This is a result of the heptamer exchange reaction between both chaperonins. One can argue the possibility that the hybrids are made up from three stacked heptamers (GroEL14·Tcpn607), that is, that GroEL14 simply binds Tcpn607 as a substrate protein. This possibility was excluded from the analysis of molecular size with gel-permeation HPLC, the observation of molecular shape by electron micrograph, and the estimation of the molar ratio of GroEL:T.cpn60 from phenylthiohydantoin derivatives recovered in Edman degradation and from the staining intensity of the bands in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4, inset). The random incorporation of each cpn60 monomer into the tetradecamers is also very unlikely. If it really happened, numerous protein bands corresponding to the complexes with various combinations of parent chaperonin monomers should have appeared between the bands of parent chaperonins in native PAGE. However, only a single band appeared between parent chaperonins when the hybrid was formed from GroEL14 and Tcpn6014 (Fig. 2). In addition, under the experiment conditions, bands of monomeric GroEL and monomeric Tcpn60 with meaningful staining intensity were not observed in native PAGE (data not shown). Therefore, there is little possibility, if any, that dissociation into monomers occurs before formation of the hybrid. Hybrid formation is not restricted to the combination ofThermus chaperonins and GroEL and is also observed between Tcpn6014 and chaperonin from P. denitrificans(10Ishii N. Taguchi H. Sumi M.

Nature. 1996; 383: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) reported that the hybrid between wild-type GroEL14 and mutant GroEL14, called MR1 (mixed ring), is formed at 42 °C in the presence of ATP and K+. These observations suggest that hybrid formation is not an exceptional event but a rather common reaction among chaperonins from several species. Because the conditions for hybrid formation are nearly physiological, hybrids can be formed even in a living cell. Indeed, when we expressed Tcpn6014 in E. colicells, a part of the chaperonin was purified as a form of hybrid chaperonin that was separated from Tcpn6014 by anion-exchange HPLC (see “Experimental Procedures”).4Furthermore, the observation that single-ring T. brockiicpn60 dimerizes to a tetradecamer in the presence of both adenine nucleotides and cpn10 (14Todd M.J. Walke S. Lorimer G. Truscott K. Scopes R.K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14932-14941Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) also implies that there is a heptamer exchange in the bacterium. Unless GroEL14 and Tcpn6014 split into GroEL7 and Tcpn607, hybrid formation is impossible. The ATP/K+-dependent split of Thermuschaperonin has been established, and Tcpn607 can be readily detected and isolated (17Ishii N. Taguchi H. Sasabe H. Yoshida M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A stable heptameric form of cpn60 has also been isolated from T. brockii (13Truscott K.N. H⊘j P.B. Scopes R.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 14Todd M.J. Walke S. Lorimer G. Truscott K. Scopes R.K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14932-14941Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and from mitochondria (15Miller S.G. Leclerc R.F. Erdos G.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 407-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 16Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G.H. Seetharam R. Gupta R.S. Oppenheim J. Thomas J.O. Cowan N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 695-698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A possible heptameric form of GroEL has been reported by two groups. Mendoza et al. (28Mendoza J.A. Demeler B. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2447-2451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that a GroEL species, possibly heptamers, is detected in the presence of 3 m urea after the addition of unfolded rhodanese. Mizobata and Kawata (29Mizobata T. Kawata Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1209: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) observed a GroEL species exhibiting decreased light scattering in the presence of less than 1 m guanidine HCl, and they speculated that the species is a heptamer of GroEL (29Mizobata T. Kawata Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1209: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We also observed a decrease in light scattering of GroEL14 in response to the addition of ATP.4 The fact that the hybrid is formed between wild-type GroEL14 and mutant MR1-GroEL14 under the appropriate conditions implies that not only mutant MR1-GroEL14 but also wild-type GroEL14 splits into heptamers (27Burston S.G. Weissman J.S. Farr G.W. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Therefore, GroEL14 most likely splits, although the final conclusion on the presence of GroEL7 should be reserved until success in isolating the heptameric form of GroEL has been achieved. Once the hybrid is formed, it is very stable. Parent chaperonins are not regenerated from hybrid chaperonin even in the presence of ATP/K+ (Fig. 7). If the split into heptamers is an obligatory step in the functional reaction cycle of the chaperonin, parent chaperonin should be formed as a result of a heptamer exchange reaction. Two explanations are possible: (a) split reaction occurs only once before the chaperonin starts the first turnover of the functional cycle; or (b) split reaction occurs in each of the reaction cycles, but reassociation always happens to heterologous combinations (GroEL7-Tcpn607) rather than homologous combinations (GroEL7-GroEL7 or Tcpn607-Tcpn607), thus producing the hybrid again. However, the latter possibility is unlikely, if not impossible, because the parent GroEL14 is not regenerated from the hybrid GroEL7·MR1-GroEL7 in the presence of ATP/K+ (27Burston S.G. Weissman J.S. Farr G.W. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and it is not easy to assume that wild-type GroEL7 has a much higher affinity to mutant MR1-GroEL7 than it does to wild-type GroEL7. A requirement for high concentrations of ATP and K+ is also contradictory to the notion that the split is one of obligatory steps in the chaperonin functional cycle. Steady-state ATPase activity of GroEL14 is inversely dependent on K+; it is saturated at ∼5 mm K+ in the presence of 50 μm ATP and at ∼300 mm K+ in the presence of 2 μm ATP (26Todd M.J. Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8560-8567Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 30Viitanen P.V. Lubben T.H. Reed J. Goloubinoff P. O'Keefe D.P. Lorimer G.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5665-5671Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). On the contrary, hybrids were formed only when concentrations of both K+ and ATP were high, and the yield of hybrids was saturated at ∼300 mm K+ and ∼300 μm ATP (Fig. 1,C and D). If either one of the concentrations was reduced, the yield of hybrids decreased, and no hybrid formation was observed at 5 mm K+/1 mm ATP or at 300 mm K+/2 μm ATP. Therefore, the requirement of K+ for hybrid formation is a different phenomenon than the K+ requirement for steady-state ATPase activity. Although the occurrence of the heptamer exchange reaction has been established, understanding of its functional and physiological significance awaits further study. We thank Drs. K. Ito and Y.

This protein has an apparent molecular mass of 105 kDa and has been designated dTAFIII105.Drosophila S-2 cell extracts that were immunodepleted of dTAFIII105 were substantially reduced in their capacity to support tRNA gene transcription. A protein (far Western) blot analysis revealed that dTAFIII105, present in a TFIIIB fraction, directly interacts with TATA-binding protein (TBP). Coimmunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that this protein associates with TBP in S-2 cell extracts. Our previous studies have identified a mutation at position 332 within Drosophila TBP that changes a highly conserved arginine residue to a histidine residue, which renders it specifically defective in its ability to support RNA polymerase III transcription in S-2 cells (Trivedi, A., Vilalta, A., Gopalan, S., and Johnson, D. L. (1996) Mol. Cell. Biol. 16, 6909–6916). We further demonstrate that extracts prepared from a stable cell line expressing epitope-tagged wild-type TBP exhibit an increase in tRNA gene transcription, whereas extracts derived from cells expressing the mutant TBP protein do not. Coimmunoprecipitation assays and far Western blot analysis demonstrate that this mutation in TBP abolishes its ability to stably interact with dTAFIII105. Thus, we have identified both aDrosophila protein that is directly associated with TBP in the TFIIIB complex, dTAFIII105, and an amino acid residue within the highly conserved carboxyl-terminal region of TBP that is critical for dTAFIII105-TBP interactions.

III requires several ancillary factors (for reviews, see Refs. 2Willis I.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar and 3Geiduschek E.P. Tocchini-Valentini G.P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 873-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). There are three major classes of RNA pol III promoters, typified by the genes encoding tRNA, 5 S RNA, and U6 RNA. The tRNA class of promoters utilizes transcription factor IIIB (TFIIIB) and TFIIIC. The 5 S RNA gene additionally requires TFIIIA. The U6 RNA class of promoter, in vertebrates, requires a multiprotein complex referred to as SNAPc-PTF-PBP, one of the two TFIIIC subcomplexes, the TATA-binding protein (TBP), and possibly other components of TFIIIB (4Sadowski C.L.

Thus, in addition to RNA pol III, the only other component that is required for the transcription of all classes of RNA pol III promoters is TFIIIB. TFIIIB is a multisubunit protein complex that contains TBP and at least two TBP-associated factors (TAFs). TBP has been shown to be essential for the transcription of all cellular genes (for a review, see Ref. 7Hernandez N. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1291-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). It is associated with at least 13 distinct TAFs that form the TFIID complex, which is specific for the transcription of RNA pol II genes (8Dynlacht B.D. Hoey T. Tjian R.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2749-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Another complex, B-TFIID, consisting of TBP and a single large TAF, has also been implicated in RNA pol II transcription (11Chiang C.M. Ge H. Wang Z. Hoffmann A. Roeder R.G.

A. 1992; 89: 8140-8144Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For the transcription of RNA pol I promoters, TBP is associated with three unique TAFs that compose the SL1 complex (13Comai L. Tanese N. Tjian R. Cell. 1992; 68: 965-976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 14Eberhard D. Tora L. Egly J.M. Grummt I. Nucleic Acids. Res. 1993; 21: 4180-4186Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In addition, another complex, SNAPc-PTF-PBP, which is thought to associate with TBP (4Sadowski C.L. Henry R.W. Lobo S.M. Hernandez N. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1535-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and is used to transcribe specific small nuclear RNA genes, is composed of four polypeptides (4Sadowski C.L.

Biol. 1995; 15: 2019-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Thus, the ability of TBP to form these distinct TBP·TAF complexes dictates its role in the transcription of specific cellular promoters. The structure of TFIIIB is best understood in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Yeast TFIIIB is composed of TBP, a 70-kDa polypeptide (BRF1/PCF4/TDS4; yTFIIIB70) (15Colbert T. Hahn S.

Cell. 1992; 71: 211-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) first suggested a direct interaction between yTFIIIB70 and TBP. This interaction has been confirmed by in vitro experiments using recombinant TBP and yTFIIIB70 (21Huet J. Conesa C. Manaud N. Chaussivert N. Sentenac A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3433-3439Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 22Khoo B. Brophy B. Jackson S.P. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2879-2890Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In addition, yTFIIIB70 has been shown to interact with the 135-kDa subunit of TFIIIC (23Bartholomew B. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5181-5189Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 24Chaussivert N. Conesa C. Shaaban S. Sentenac A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15353-15358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and the 34-kDa subunit of RNA pol III (25Werner M. Chaussivert N. Willis I.M. Sentenac A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20721-20724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies are consistent with the observation that TFIIIC bound to the DNA serves to recruit TFIIIB to the template, and TFIIIB then functions as an initiation factor to recruit RNA pol III (26Kassavetis G.A. Braun B.R. Nguyen L.H. Geiduschek E.P. Cell. 1990; 60: 235-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The structure of TFIIIB in higher eucaryotes is less well defined. Human TFIIIB preparations have been reported to contain, in addition to TBP, polypeptides of (i) 190, 96, 87, and 60 kDa (27Chiang C.M. Ge H. Wang Z. Hoffmann A. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2749-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar); (ii) 150, 82, and 54 kDa (28Lobo S.M. Tanaka M. Sullivan M.L. Hernandez N. Cell. 1992; 71: 1029-1040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar); and (iii) 172 kDa and a TBP-associated factor L of undefined size (29Taggart A.K. Fisher T.S. Pugh B.F. Cell. 1992; 71: 1015-1028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, the largest polypeptide in these preparations appears to result from contamination of TFIIIA with the B-TFIID complex (30Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7026-7030Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In Xenopus, TFIIIB was reported to be composed of TBP and at least two additional polypeptides of 92 and 75 kDa (31McBryant S.J. Meier E. Leresche A. Sharp S.J. Wolf V.J. Gottesfeld J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 16: 4639-4647Crossref Google Scholar). A cDNA encoding a non-TBP component of the TFIIIB complex has been cloned from human cells (30Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7026-7030Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 32Mital R. Kobayashi R. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7031-7042Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal region of hTFIIIB90 exhibits high sequence similarity to yTFIIIB70, while the carboxyl-terminal region contains a high mobility group protein 2-related domain. A recombinant protein containing 394 amino acids of the carboxyl-terminal region of TFIIIB90 strongly associates with TBP, while an amino-terminal 300-amino acid fragment of the protein interacts relatively weakly. TFIIIB has been shown to be a key target for the regulation of RNA pol III gene activity in several diverse processes. Alterations in TFIIIB activity have been shown to occur during different stages of cell differentiation (33Meissner W. Ahlers A. Seifart K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5888-5897Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), cell growth (34Tower J. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 35Dieci G. Duimio L. Peracchia G. Ottonello S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13476-13482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and the cell cycle (36Gottesfeld J.M. Wolf V.J. Dang T. Forbes D.J. Hartl P. Science. 1994; 263: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar,37White R.J. Gottlieb T.M. Downes C.S. Jackson S.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1983-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In addition, increases in TFIIIB activity have been shown to mediate the induction of RNA pol III genes in response to certain viral proteins such as the hepatitis B virus X protein (38Wang H.D. Yuh C.H. Dang C.V. Johnson D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6720-6728Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax protein (39Gottesfeld J.M. Johnson D.L. Nyborg J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1777-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The activation of cellular protein kinases also increases TFIIIB activity (40Garber M.E. Vilalta A. Johnson D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thus, the determination of the structure of TFIIIB and its interactions with other transcription components is fundamental to our understanding of RNA pol III gene regulation. We have previously shown that TBP is a limiting factor for RNA pol III transcription in Drosophila S-2 cells (1Trivedi A. Vilalta A. Gopalan S. Johnson D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6909-6916Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Both stable and transient transfection of epitope-tagged TBP enhanced transcription of transfected tRNA and U6 RNA gene promoters. We further determined whether the stimulation in transcription was a direct result of increased TBP complexes at these promoters. A mutant TBP protein that changed a highly conserved arginine residue to a histidine at position 332 within the carboxyl-terminal region was expressed and found to be specifically defective in its ability to support transcription of either of the RNA pol III promoters. However, the mutant TBP protein completely maintained its ability to support transcription of two RNA pol II promoters. These results demonstrated that the TBP-dependent increase in RNA pol II gene activity is not sufficient for enhanced RNA pol III transcription; rather, a direct effect on RNA pol III promoters is required. Although other transcription components may also be limiting for the transcription of RNA pol III genes, these studies demonstrate that TBP is one component that limits the expression of these genes. In this study, we have investigated why the mutation at position 332 within Drosophila TBP renders it defective for RNA pol III transcription. To do so, we have identified a polypeptide within theDrosophila TFIIIB complex. This represents the first identification of a Drosophila RNA pol III transcription factor. This subunit, TAFIII105, associates with epitope-tagged TBP that is expressed in a Drosophila S-2 stable cell line. In contrast, TAFIII105 fails to associate with the epitope-tagged mutant TBP332 protein. Far Western blot analysis revealed that TBP, but not TBP332, binds to TAFIII105 present in a TFIIIB fraction. Our results provide the first report of a TBP mutation that eliminates its ability to support RNA pol III transcription by disrupting its direct association with a subunit of the TFIIIB complex in Drosophila cells. Furthermore, these studies provide new physical evidence that the carboxyl-terminal direct repeat within TBP directly interacts with the TFIIIB subunit. Early passage Drosophila Schneider S-2 cells were grown in Schneider medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Gemini). Medium for F-TBP and F-TBP332 cell lines additionally contains hygromycin B (Boehringer Mannheim) at 250 μg/ml. F-TBP and F-TBP332 cell lines were obtained by stable transfection of Drosophila Schneider S-2 cells as described previously (1Trivedi A. Vilalta A. Gopalan S. Johnson D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6909-6916Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic (S100) extracts derived from Drosophila Schneider S-2 cells, F-TBP cells, or F-TBP332 cells were prepared according to the method of Dingermann (41Dingermann T. Sharp S. Appel B. DeFranco D. Mount S. Heiermann R. Pongs O. Soll D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 3907-3918Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). F-TBP and F-TBP332 cells were treated with 500 μm CuSO4 48 h prior to harvesting the cells. The Drosophila TFIIIB and TFIIIC/TFIID fractions were obtained by fractionation of S-2 cell S100 extracts on phosphocellulose (Whatman P-11) as described previously (40Garber M.E. Vilalta A. Johnson D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 42Segall J. Matsui T. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11986-11991Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The TFIIIB fraction was eluted stepwise at 0.35 m KCl, and the TFIIIC/TFIID fraction was eluted at 1 m KCl. The plasmid, pArg-maxi, used as template forin vitro transcription reactions, contains a derivative of aDrosophila tRNAArg gene that has an additional 12 nucleotides inserted between the internal promoter regions (43Dingermann T. Sharp S. Schaack J. Soll D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10395-10402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). pF-TBP denotes an expression plasmid that produces an amino-terminally Flag-tagged (MDYKDDDDK) Drosophila TBP protein. pF-TBP332 contains a mutation within the TBP cDNA corresponding to amino acid position 332 that changes an arginine residue to a histidine residue. The expression of both TBP proteins is under the control of the metallothionein promoter. These plasmids were used to produceDrosophila Schneider S-2 stably transfected cell lines as described previously (1Trivedi A. Vilalta A. Gopalan S. Johnson D.L. Mol. Cell.

Plasmids pCITE-FTBP and pCITE-FTBP332, used as templates for in vitro transcription/translation, were obtained by subcloning the epitope-tagged wild-type and mutant TBP cDNAs into plasmid pCITE-2b (Novagen) using NcoI andSalI restriction sites. Transcription assay mixtures contained 0.3 μg of DNA template; 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9); 5 mm MgCl2; 3 mm dithiothreitol; 100 mm KCl; 10% glycerol; 0.5 mm each ATP, CTP, and UTP; and 0.1 mm [α-32P]GTP (6 Ci/mmol) in a 60-μl final volume. Equal amounts of protein (160 μg) from each extract were used in the experiment shown in Fig. 1. The amount of extract used for each reaction was previously determined to be within the linear range of the assay. Reactions were incubated for 1 h at room temperature and stopped by the addition of 0.1% SDS and 400 mg/ml proteinase K. After 15 min at 37 °C, RNA was purified by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation and analyzed by electrophoresis on 8 m urea, 8% polyacrylamide gels. Transcription products were visualized by autoradiography and quantitated by densitometry. Proteins from the cell extracts were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7.5%) followed by blotting onto nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell) by the semidry method described by Kyhse-Andersen (44Kyhse-Andersen J. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1984; 10: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (2154) Google Scholar). Total DrosophilaTBP was detected with affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies raised against Drosophila TBP (kindly provided by J. Kadonaga, University of California, San Diego). The M5 monoclonal antibody (Eastman Kodak Co.) specific for the Flag epitope was used to specifically detect the Flag-tagged F-TBP and F-TBP332 proteins (45Hopp T.P. Prickett K.S. Price V. Libby R.T. March C.J. Cerretti P. Urdal D.L. Conlon P.J. Biotechnology. 1988; 6: 1205-1210Crossref Scopus (751) Google Scholar).Drosophila TAFIII105 was detected using anti-human IIIB90 rabbit polyclonal antibodies that were affinity-purified (30Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7026-7030Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase-linked antibodies (Vectastain) and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (HRPL kit; National Diagnostics) were used to detect bound antibodies. Far Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (21Huet J. Conesa C. Manaud N. Chaussivert N. Sentenac A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3433-3439Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Twenty micrograms of protein from the designated phosphocellulose P-11 fractions was subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose as described for Western blot analysis. After the transfer, the filters were rinsed briefly in distilled water followed by incubation at 4 °C for 1 h in buffer E (20 mmHEPES (pH 7.9), 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mmEDTA, 20% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) containing 5% nonfat milk and 100 mm KCl. Filters were rinsed in buffer E containing either 100 mm KCl (for the “low stringency” wash) or 350 mm KCl (for the “high stringency” wash) and then incubated with 35S-labeled F-TBP or F-TBP332 (100,000 cpm/ml) overnight at 4 °C. The filters were washed twice for 15 min at 4 °C with buffer E containing either 100 mm KCl or 350 mm KCl and then once with the same buffer without glycerol. The filters were then washed with 15% trichloroacetic acid followed by a wash with 50% ethanol. The bound F-TBP or F-TBP332 was detected by autoradiography, and bands were quantified using a Bioimage scanner. For the immunodepletions and immunoprecipitation assays, equal amounts of protein, typically 300–600 μg, from the cytoplasmic extracts were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 5 μl of the antibodies specified. Protein A-Sepharose (Santa Cruz) was pretreated by incubating equal volume amounts of the resin and the cytoplasmic extract. After a 1-h incubation on ice, the sample was centrifuged to pellet the resin, the supernatant was discarded, and the resin pellet was resuspended in buffer E to the original volume. Protein A-Sepharose was added (15 μl each) to the cytoplasmic extracts that had been incubated with antibody, and the samples were incubated at 4 °C overnight with gentle mixing. Samples were centrifuged, and the immunodepleted supernatants were used for in vitrotranscription assays. For analysis of the immunoprecipitated proteins, the pellets were washed extensively with buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 350 mm KCl, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. The pellets were then resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Equal volume amounts of the samples were used for Western blot analysis. Drosophila S-2 cells were previously used to generate stable cell lines that express epitope-tagged wild-type and mutant TBP proteins (1Trivedi A. Vilalta A. Gopalan S. Johnson D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6909-6916Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). TBP expression plasmids were constructed to contain a nine-amino acid Flag epitope coding region fused at the amino terminus of a DrosophilaTBP cDNA, and the genes were placed under the control of the metallothionein promoter, which is inducible with copper. The S-2 cell line generated by stable transfection of the expression plasmid containing the wild type TBP cDNA is designated F-TBP. The stable cell line generated by transfection of the expression plasmid harboring a mutation within the TBP cDNA that results in an arginine to histidine change at position 332 in the protein is designated F-TBP322. We have previously shown that when the F-TBP stable line is induced with copper, transient expression of a tRNA gene promoter is enhanced. However, when the F-TBP332 cell line is induced with copper to express the mutant protein, no increase in the expression of the RNA pol III promoter is observed (1Trivedi A. Vilalta A. Gopalan S. Johnson D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6909-6916Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To further determine if the differential abilities of the overexpressed wild type and mutant proteins to enhance RNA pol III transcription could be reproduced in vitro, we prepared extracts from the two stable cell lines and determined their transcriptional activities. As shown in Fig. 1, cytoplasmic extracts derived from the F-TBP cells consistently exhibited at least a 3-fold increase in the transcriptional activity of a tRNA gene template compared with the parental S-2 cell extracts. In contrast, extracts derived from the cells expressing F-TBP332 actually exhibited an approximate 3-fold decrease in their ability to support tRNA gene transcription compared with the S-2 cell extracts. The 10-fold difference in the transcriptional activities of extracts derived from the F-TBP and F-TBP332 stable lines can not be attributed to differences in the amount of expressed F-TBP and F-TBP332 proteins, since we have previously shown that similar levels of these proteins are produced (1Trivedi A. Vilalta A. Gopalan S. Johnson D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6909-6916Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, these results provide further evidence that the mutation at position 332 in the TBP protein renders it defective in RNA pol III transcription and that TBP is a limiting transcription component inDrosophila. Previous studies have shown that transient expression of epitope-tagged TBP enhanced transcription from both TATA-containing and TATA-lacking RNA pol III promoters, whereas expression of epitope-tagged TBP332 failed to stimulate either promoter class (1Trivedi A. Vilalta A. Gopalan S. Johnson D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6909-6916Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These results suggested that the arginine residue at position 332 is important for TBP interactions with other proteins in both the tRNA and U6 RNA gene transcription complexes. TBP has been found to be associated with at least one other polypeptide in the TFIIIB complex in the yeast and human systems. In the human system, a polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of 90 kDa, hIIIB90, has been identified that interacts with TBP in the TFIIIB complex (30Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7026-7030Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether the mutation at position 332 inDrosophila TBP affected its ability to associate with the corresponding Drosophila TAF. To do so, antibodies directed against hIIIB90 were first used to identify the analogous TAF in a partially purified TFIIIB fraction derived from DrosophilaS-2 cell extracts. Western blot analysis revealed that the antibodies cross-reacted with a Drosophila polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of 105 kDa, compared with the 90-kDa cross-reacting polypeptide present in HeLa extracts (Fig.2 A). A faint signal was also observed in both lanes in a region corresponding to approximately 65 kDa. Since this signal was also observed in lanes where no protein was present, this represents a nonspecific interaction. To further determine the specificity of the interaction of the 105-kDa protein with the antibodies, this polypeptide was immunodepleted from S-2 extracts using the anti-hIIIB90 antibodies, and the ability of the resultant extracts to transcribe a tRNA gene template was assessed. As shown in Fig.2 B, immunodepletion with the hIIIB90 antibodies substantially reduced the transcriptional activity of the extract (approximately 15-fold) compared with mock-depleted extracts. Together, these results suggest that the 105-kDa polypeptide is theDrosophila equivalent to the hIIIB90 protein. To further assess whether the 105-kDa protein was a subunit within the TFIIIB complex, we determined whether this polypeptide was associated with TBP. Extracts were prepared from S-2, F-TBP, and F-TBP332 cell lines that had been induced with copper sulfate, and immunoprecipitation studies were performed to examine protein-protein interactions (Fig. 3). The extracts were immunoprecipitated with Drosophila TBP antibodies (αTBP), the Flag epitope antibodies (αFlag), or the hIIIB90 antibodies (αhIIIB90). The resultant immunoprecipitates were then analyzed by Western blot to determine the presence or absence of F-TBP, F-TBP332, or the 105-kDa protein. We first determined whether the 105-kDa protein was associated with TBP present in all extracts. When extracts were immunoprecipitated with αhIIIB90 and the resultant precipitates were probed with αTBP, we found that TBP coprecipitated with the 105-kDa protein in all three extracts (Fig. 3 A). Likewise, immunoprecipitation with αTBP resulted in the coprecipitation of the 105-kDa protein (Fig. 3 B). These results demonstrate that the 105-kDa polypeptide is physically associated with TBP inDrosophila cells. To further determine whether the 105-kDa polypeptide is directly associated with TBP, we used a protein blot (far Western) analysis to examine the interaction of F-TBP with polypeptides within a phosphocellulose-derived TFIIIB (Fig. 4 A). Proteins within the TFIIIB fraction were separated on SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose"

Two biologically highly active natural retinoids have been identified, all-trans-retinoic acid (t-RA) and 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA). The RXRs exclusively bind 9-cis-RA, whereas the RARs bind both isomers of RA with comparable affinity. Recently published results suggest that RARs have the same binding site for t-RA and 9-cis-RA but with different determinants (1–3). Antagonist binding on RARα has been suggested to induce distinct conformational changes in comparison with agonist binding. To elucidate the region minimally required for efficient binding of agonist (t-RA and 9-cis-RA) and antagonist Ro 41-5253 to the RARα, we generated N- and C-terminally truncated mutants of the receptor. Characterization of these deletion mutant proteins using protease mapping and ligand binding experiments revealed that different parts of the ligand-binding domain are necessary for t-RA, 9-cis-RA, and antagonist binding. Three distinct regions of the ligand-binding domain of the human retinoic acid receptor-α are required for binding of t-RA (RARα187–402), 9-cis-RA (RARα188–409), and the antagonist Ro 41-5253 (RARα226–414).

Rachez C. Formstecher P. Lefebvre Ph Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5477-5485Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated recently that Cys-235, Arg-217, and Arg-294 of hRARα play a role in antagonist binding, showing specific requirements for efficient antagonist binding to hRARα (3Lamour F.P.Y. Lardelli P. Apfel C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5386-5392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown by competitive binding experiments, t-RA competes with the antagonist for RARα binding (40Keidel S. LeMotte P. Apfel C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 287-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This strongly suggests that the antagonist shares a common binding site with the RA isomers. To analyze the minimal structural requirements for an efficient binding of either t-RA, 9-cis-RA, or Ro 41-5253 to the hRARα, we generated N- and C-terminally truncated RARα mutants. Characterization of these deletion-mutant proteins using protease mapping and ligand binding experiments revealed that different parts of the ligand-binding domain of RARα are necessary for t-RA, 9-cis-RA, and antagonist binding. [3H]t-RA (50 Ci/mmol) was obtained from NEN Life Science Products. 9-cis-[3H]RA (25 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Amersham Corp. [3H]Ro 41-5253 (28 Ci/mmol), unlabeled RA isomers and analogues were synthesized at F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., Basel, Switzerland. All procedures using retinoids were carried out under dimmed light. The TNT® coupled reticulocyte lysate system was purchased from Promega. [35S]Methionine (>1000 Ci/mmol),14C-methylated protein molecular weight markers, and Amplify™ were obtained from Amersham. Restriction enzymes were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. Trypsin (type I: from bovine pancreas) was purchased from Sigma. The human RARα cDNA insert of pT7-RARα (42Keidel S. Rupp E. Szardenings M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 1141-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) was subcloned as a MscI-BamHI fragment into pSG5-MscI giving pSG5-RARα. pSG5-MscI was constructed by replacing the EcoRI-BamHI fragment of pSG5 (43Green S. Issemann I. Sheer I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 369Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar) with a linker containing an MscI site. RARα deletion mutants were produced by PCR. The correctness of the sequence was confirmed by sequencing. For N-terminal deletions: removal of theEcoRI site of pET3a (44Studier F.W. Moffat B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4819) Google Scholar) was carried out by restriction withEcoRI, fill-in reaction and religation, yielding pET3a-ΔE. The linker (5′-TATGGAATTCTAGCGCTTA-3′), including a start codon and a subsequent EcoRI site, was ligated into theNdeI site of pET3a-ΔE giving pET3a-E. pSG5-M was constructed by ligation of the linker (5′-AATTGCTACCACCATGGAATT-3′) in the EcoRI site of pSG5. The mutants were generated by PCR using pT7-RARα as template. The PCR products were restricted withEcoRI-BamHI (located in the 5′ primer and 3′ primer, respectively) and cloned into pET3a-E (expression inEscherichia coli for binding studies) or pSG5-M (in vitro translation for limited proteolytic digestion). For C-terminal deletions, the mutants were generated by PCR using pT7-RARα as template, 5′ primers (positions 466–486), and 3′ primer containing a BamHI site. The PCR products were restricted with SacI-BamHI and cloned into either the full-length pSG5-RARα restricted withSacI-BamHI (in vitro translation for limited proteolytic digestion) or the truncated pET3a-RARα-Δ155 restricted with SacI-BamHI (expression inE. coli for binding studies). RARα deletion mutants were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLys (44Studier F.W. Moffat B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4819) Google Scholar). Expression and solubility problems occurred with the N-terminal deletion mutants hRARα-Δ188, -Δ189, -Δ225, -Δ226, and -Δ227 expressed in E. coli. These truncated proteins were synthesized with the TNT® coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) for the determination of the IC50values. For these last mutant receptors, a 40–60% specific binding was sufficient to allow the IC50 determination. SinceK d values, for either t-RA or 9-cis-RA, have been established for the C-terminal point mutants of hRARα (aa 405–419) (2Tate B.F. Grippo J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20258-20263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), we determined the binding activity of the C-terminally truncated receptors by Scatchard analysis for the same ligands. From the N-terminally truncated hRARα (aa 187–227), no binding activity was determined previously, and we verified the binding activity by IC50 determination. The binding assays (K d and IC50 determinations) were performed as described elsewhere (3Lamour F.P.Y. Lardelli P. Apfel C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5386-5392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human RARα (wt or truncated) in pSG5 was in vitro transcribed and translated in the presence of [35S]methionine by using rabbit reticulocyte lysates as specified by Promega. The limited proteolytic digestions were performed as described elsewhere (40Keidel S. LeMotte P. Apfel C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 287-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). An important region for the t-RA binding (aa 186–198) was defined previously in hRARα by a N-terminally truncated receptor (41Lefebvre B. Rachez C. Formstecher P. Lefebvre Ph Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5477-5485Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A C-terminal deletion to position 403 resulted in a moderate decrease in affinity for the same ligand (41Lefebvre B. Rachez C. Formstecher P. Lefebvre Ph Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5477-5485Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a C-terminal deletion to position 404 of hRARα exhibited aK d of 0.3 nm for t-RA (2Tate B.F. Grippo J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20258-20263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To determine the precise region of the hRARα-LBD required for an efficient t-RA binding, we used binding assays and protease mapping to probe t-RA binding to N- and C-terminally truncated hRARα-LBD (Figs. 1 and2).Figure 2Effect of t-RA (lanes 11–16), 9-cis-RA (lanes 17–22), and Ro 41-5253 (lanes 23–27) on limited tryptic digestion of RARα wild type (wt) and N-terminal deletion mutants.

The experimental conditions were the same as described in the legend to Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A K d of 1.1 nm for t-RA was obtained with the hRARα-LBD (aa 155–462) (Table I). This value is in the range of the K d published for the full-length hRARα expressed in E. coli or COS cells (0.67 nm (42Keidel S. Rupp E. Szardenings M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 1141-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), 1.7 nm (45Ostrowski J. Hammer L. Roalsvig T. Pokornowski K. Reczek P.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Among the N-terminally truncated receptors, the hRARα-Δ187 exhibited good protection against trypsin digestion when bound to t-RA. A strongly reduced signal was observed for the digestion of the hRARα-Δ188 truncated receptor under the same conditions. At the C-terminal end of the receptor, the same tendency was observed with the two mutants hRARα-Δ402 and hRARα-Δ401. In regard to the binding activity of these mutant receptors, the N-terminally truncated hRARα-Δ187 exhibited a K d value 4.5-fold higher than the wild type hRARα-LBD, whereas a deletion of a single further amino acid abolished the binding activity in such a way that neitherK d nor IC50 could be determined (TableII).Table IIEffect of truncation of the N-terminal portion of the hRARα on binding of t-RA, 9-cis-RA, and the antagonist Ro 41–5253The IC50 values are the mean of two single experiments.1 NB, no binding activity detectable. Open table in a new tab The IC50 values are the mean of two single experiments. 1 NB, no binding activity detectable. Similar experiments were carried out using N-terminally truncated mutants of hRARγ. We found that hRARγ-Δ189 (hRARα-Δ187) was able to bind t-RA with an affinity comparable with the full-length hRARγ, whereas hRARγ-Δ190 (hRARα-Δ188) showed no detectable binding activity to this ligand (data not shown). Therefore, it appears that, while the C-terminal region of the D domain of RARα (aa 188–199) is required for efficient binding of the t-RA, the C-terminal part of the E domain (aa 403–419) and the entire F domain can be deleted without affecting the ability of the RARα to bind its natural t-RA ligand (see Fig. 3). Two contradictory results have been published concerning the binding of 9-cis-RA to C-terminal deletion mutants of hRARα. Lefebvre et al. (41Lefebvre B. Rachez C. Formstecher P. Lefebvre Ph Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5477-5485Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) observed that a deletion up to position 403 of the hRARα expressed in E. coli resulted in a moderate decrease in affinity for 9-cis-RA (41Lefebvre B. Rachez C. Formstecher P. Lefebvre Ph Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5477-5485Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a small region (aa 405–419) within the ligand binding domain of a truncated hRARα was demonstrated to be required for the 9-cis-RA binding (2Tate B.F. Grippo J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20258-20263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In our study, a K d value of 1 nm was determined for the binding of 9-cis-RA to the hRARα-LBD. This value is in agreement with the range of the reported data for the truncated receptors expressed in E. coli (0.3 nm for the hRARα-Δ419 (2Tate B.F. Grippo J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20258-20263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and 1.2 nm for the hRARα-LBD (3Lamour F.P.Y. Lardelli P. Apfel C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5386-5392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). After the limited trypsin digestion of the N-terminally truncated hRARα liganded to 9-cis-RA, the corresponding protection was almost completely abolished for the mutant hRARα-Δ189, and a reduction of the signal was already observed for the mutant hRARα-Δ188 (Fig. 2). At the C-terminal end of the receptor, the digestion of the hRARα-Δ409 liganded to 9-cis-RA by trypsin yielded a band of the appropriate size, whereas the truncated hRARα at the next residue (hRARα-Δ408) exhibited only a faint band (Fig. 1). IC50 and K d determinations for the binding of the 9-cis-RA to the above mentioned truncated receptors confirmed the N- and C-terminal deletion borders of the hRARα concerning the RA isomer. No 9-cis-RA binding was detectable to the hRARα-Δ189, whereas a 5-fold higher IC50 value was obtained for the binding of the t-RA isomer to the hRARα-Δ188 in comparison with the hRARα-LBD (Table II). At the C-terminal end, a 35-fold higher K d value, was obtained for the hRARα-Δ409, while the hRARα-Δ408 bound the 9-cis-RA more than 150-fold less efficiently than the hRARα-LBD (Table I). From these results, it is clear that the C-terminal region of the D domain of RARα (aa 189–199) is required for an efficient binding of 9-cis-RA. Furthermore, the C-terminal part of the E domain (up to aa 409) is also crucial for the binding efficiency of this ligand to the hRARα (see Fig. 3). The antagonist Ro 41-5253 has been reported to induce a different conformational change when bound to the hRARα (40Keidel S. LeMotte P. Apfel C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 287-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). It has also been shown recently that Ro 41-5253, as well as other antagonists, exhibit distinctly different requirements for efficient binding to hRARα (3Lamour F.P.Y. Lardelli P. Apfel C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5386-5392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we determined an IC50value of 16 nm for the binding activity of the antagonist Ro 41-5253 to the hRARα-LBD (Table I). Limited trypsin proteolysis of the N- and C-terminally truncated hRARα bound to Ro 41-5253 led to the definition of the N-terminal deletion border between the residue D226 and the residue Lys-227 and the C-terminal deletion border between the residue L414 and M413 of the E region of the hRARα-LBD. Concerning the binding activity of Ro 41-5253 to the truncated hRARαs, 24- and 15-fold higher IC50 values for hRARα-Δ227 and hRARα-Δ413 have been observed, respectively, in comparison with the hRARα-LBD (Tables I and II). Remarkably, the hRARα-Δ226 and the hRARα-Δ414 mutant exhibited only a 2- and 3.5-fold reduction in IC50, respectively, in comparison with the hRARα-LBD. These results evidence distinctly different requirements of the N- and C-terminal regions of the ligand-binding domain of the hRARα for binding Ro 41-5253 compared with the two other ligands t-RA and 9-cis-RA (see Fig. 3). It has been shown that the binding of both t-RA and 9-cis-RA induces a different conformational change in hRARα to that observed with the binding of the antagonist Ro 41-5253 (40Keidel S. LeMotte P. Apfel C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 287-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). At present, several arguments allow one to think that, depending on the chemical structure of the ligands, distinctly different determinants are required for the efficient binding to the RARs. Recently published results also showed distinct determinant requirements for the binding of different ligands to the estrogen receptor (47Ekena K. Weis K.E. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5069-5075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The recently described crystal structure of the RARγ ligand-binding domain bound to t-RA has clarified the ligand binding interactions. Modeling 9-cis-RA in the hRARγ binding pocket revealed that the binding site of this receptor was likely to be very similar to that of t-RA (1Renaud J.P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). In addition, three residues have been shown to play a significant role in ligand binding (agonist and antagonist) to hRARα, whereas Cys-235, Arg-217, and Arg-294 have been shown to be important residues of the hRARα-LBD, specifically for antagonist interactions (3Lamour F.P.Y. Lardelli P. Apfel C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5386-5392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, Arg-269 of the hRARβ (Arg-276 of hRARα and Arg-278 of hRARγ) has been shown to be a crucial residue for RA binding (48Tairis N. Gabriel J.L. Gyda I.I.I M. Soprano K.J. Soprano D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19516-19522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49Tairis N. Gabriel J.L. Soprano K.J. Soprano D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18380-18387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These findings and the highly conserved amino acid homology of the E domain of the RARs (92%) (23Lotan R. Clifford J.L. Biomed. Phamacother. 1991; 45: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) suggest that the binding conditions of t-RA to the three subtypes of receptors RARα, -β, and -γ are very similar. It also indicates that these ligands may compete for a unique binding site in the RARs. In the present study, the 30-fold higher K d value for 9-cis-RA binding to the C-terminal deletion hRARα-Δ409 reinforces the role of the residue Ile-410 in the 9-cis-RA binding as shown by Tate and Grippo (2Tate B.F. Grippo J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20258-20263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We have provided evidence by this study that the complete F domain can be removed without disturbing the ability of the hRARα to bind any ligand. The C-terminal part of the E domain of the hRARα (to aa 414) is sufficient for the efficient binding of the antagonist Ro 41-5253, whereas further deletion of the E domain of the hRARα to positions 409 or 402 for 9-cis-RA and t-RA, respectively, does not disturb the ability of the receptor to bind these two ligands. Interestingly, t-RA and 9-cis-RA require the C-terminal part of the D domain of the hRARα (from aa 187 and 188, respectively), while the D domain and the N-terminal part of the E domain (aa 155 to 226) are not required for the efficient binding of the antagonist Ro 41-5253. From the crystal structure of the hRARγ-LBD bound to t-RA and the modeled 9-cis-RA in the hRARγ binding pocket, less distance was expected between the ligand 9-cis-RA and the C-terminal region of the hRARγ (helix-11 and helix-12) in comparison with the t-RA spatial disposition (1Renaud J.P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). It was also clear that the C-terminal part of helix-1 overlaps with the C-terminal part of helix-3. The importance of residue Cys-235 of the hRARα in antagonist binding (3Lamour F.P.Y. Lardelli P. Apfel C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5386-5392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) indicates a role of the helix-3 in antagonist binding. Remarkably, all of helix-1 can be deleted without disturbing antagonist binding, whereas this completely abolishes agonist binding. An explanation for this could be that the C-terminal part of helix-1 may stabilize the spatial location of helix-3 required specifically for the binding of the agonists. Taken together, these results indicate that three different fragments of hRARα are minimally required for the binding of t-RA, 9-cis-RA, and Ro 41-5253. The data shown here suggest that distinct determinants of hRARα are either directly involved in the binding of these three ligands or, alternatively, they are needed to maintain the binding pocket in an appropriate conformation as a prerequisite for the binding of each of the isomers of RA as well as Ro 41-5253. Limited trypsin digestion of either wild type or truncated receptor yielded the same digested peptides corresponding to the potential cleavage sites (data not shown). The undigested mutant receptors showed positions in the gel that were in accordance with their calculated molecular weights (Fig. 1, lanes 2–13; Fig. 2, lanes 2–10). Also, the molecular weights of the fragments as determined from the SDS gel were in good accordance with the magnitude of the truncation of the mutants (Figs. 1 and 2). This indicates that the binding of either the agonists t-RA and 9-cis-RA or the antagonist Ro 41-5253 to the truncated receptors induces the same conformational change in all the mutants as that observed with the full-length RARα. In this study, we demonstrate that with trypsin digestion of 9-cis-RA-bound full-length hRARα, the resulting 30-kDa fragment is less protected against further proteolysis than the one derived from the analogous experiment with t-RA. This was evidenced by the time course of tryptic digestion of RARα bound to t-RA versus 9-cis RA-bound receptor (Fig.4). These results were further confirmed by tryptic proteolysis with increasing protease concentrations (data not shown). These differences in the proteolytic resistance cannot be explained by distinct affinities of the RA isomers to the RARα, because both exhibit K d values in the range of 1 nm(Tables I). The decreased stability of the 30-kDa fragment obtained from RARα bound to 9-cis-RA could reflect the higher off-rate of 9-cis-RA from RARα in comparison with the t-RA. Displacement assays have demonstrated that 9-cis-RA exhibits about 2-fold higher off-rates from murine RARα than t-RA (38Allenby G. Janocha R. Kazmer S. Speck J. Grippo J.F. Levin A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16689-16695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Time course experiment using Ro 41-5253 as ligand yielded also a decreased stability of the 25-KDa antagonist characteristic fragment compared with the stable 30-kDa fragment observed with t-RA (Fig. 4). Incubation of the receptor with Ro 41-5253 or 9-cis-RA instead of t-RA in the digestion assay could result in more unliganded receptors, or fragments, for a short period of time. During this time, they might change to a more relaxed conformation, more accessible to the protease. In conclusion, we have evidenced that three distinct regions of the of the hRARα-LBD are required for the efficient binding of t-RA, 9-cis-RA, and the antagonist Ro 41-5253. t-RA binding requires the region of the hRARα-LBD from amino acid 187 to amino acid 402, 9-cis-RA requires the region of the hRARα-LBD from amino acid 188 to amino acid 409, while the antagonist requires the region of the hRARα-LBD from amino acid 226 to amino acid 414.
