https://openalex.org/W2048515321,"A subtraction cDNA library enriched for RNA sequences preferentially expressed in growth-arrested cells was prepared. Six cDNA clones were identified, varying in abundance from 2% to 0.0002% of the library and in size from 0.8 to 10 kb. The corresponding mRNAs are downregulated with different kinetics upon induction of growth by serum. The kinetics of induction after serum starvation and density-dependent inhibition of two of these growth-arrest-specific (gas) genes were investigated in more detail. Two cell lines transformed by viral onc genes did not express the two gas genes. The full-length cDNA for one gene has been sequenced and the protein product preliminarily characterized by in vitro translation."

https://openalex.org/W1991372941,"We have been studying a population of bipotential glial progenitor cells in the perinatal rat optic nerve and brain in an attempt to understand how cells choose between alternative fates in the developing mammalian central nervous system (CNS). This cell population gives rise initially to oligodendrocytes and then to type-2 astrocytes, both of which apparently collaborate in sheathing axons in the CNS. In vitro studies suggest that oligodendrocyte differentiation is the constitutive pathway of development for the oligodendrocyte-type-2-astrocyte (O-2A) progenitor cell, whereas type-2 astrocyte differentiation depends on a specific inducing protein. This protein is present in the developing optic nerve when type-2 astrocytes are differentiating and can induce O-2A progenitor cells in vitro to express glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker of astrocyte differentiation. Here we show that the type-2-astrocyte-inducing protein is similar or identical to ciliary neutrotrophic factor (CNTF), which promotes the survival of some types of peripheral neurons in vitro, including ciliary ganglion neurons. This suggests that CNTF, in addition to its effect on neurons, may be responsible for triggering type-2 astrocyte differentiation in the developing CNS."

One of these, a polypeptide of relative molecular mass 19,0001 is structurally related to epidermal growth factor2–4 and binds to epidermal growth factor receptor stimulating proliferation of uninfected cells in vitro6–7 and in vivo8. Here, we show that a second, and much more abundant secretory polypeptide, is also encoded by vaccinia virus and is structurally related to the superfamily of complement control proteins. Members of this family can block complement-mediated induction of the inflammatory response, and engulfment, killing and lysis of bacteria and viruses9,10."

https://openalex.org/W1560711427,"The human gene-specific upstream stimulatory transcription factor (USF) is required, both in vivo and in vitro, for maximal expression of the major late promoter (MLP) of adenovirus. We report here the complete purification and identification of USF from HeLa cell nuclei. The protein was followed throughout its purification using a quantitative filter binding assay. With a combination of classical purification techniques and fast-flow protein liquid chromatography, USF can be purified to homogeneity starting either with a standard HeLa cell nuclear extract or with a higher salt extract from (lysed) HeLa cell nuclei (nuclear pellet extract). Approximately 20,000-fold purification from the nuclear pellet extract and 80,000-fold from the nuclear extract are necessary to obtain homogeneous preparations of the transcription factor. A maximum of 20,000 molecules of USF appear to be present in HeLa cells. Two major forms of the USF protein can be distinguished both by their slightly different mobilities in sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis (apparent molecular weights 44,000 and 43,000, respectively) and by different electrophoretic mobilities of the corresponding protein-DNA complexes. Both forms of USF are heat-stable and interact with the MLP as monomers. Antibodies elicited against purified HeLa USF interact with the transcription factor bound to the MLP upstream element."

https://openalex.org/W1967424821,"The ELH prohormone is proteolytically processed into at least nine peptides which govern egg-laying behavior in Aplysia. Quantitative immunocytochemistry demonstrates that peptides derived from the prohormone are packaged into distinct vesicle classes. Further experiments suggest the segregation occurs via a rapid initial proteolytic cleavage of the prohormone followed by sorting at the trans Golgi. Egg-laying hormone (ELH) immunoreactivity is localized to the cell body and processes, while bag cell peptide (BCP) immunoreactivity is greater in the cell body. Steady state levels of the amino-terminal set of peptides including the BCPs are 3- to 8-fold lower than the carboxy-terminal cleavage products, such as ELH. Thus, intracellular packaging and routing of the peptides cleaved from a single prohormone regulate their localization and levels in these neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2053393022,"A novel x-ray diffraction technique, multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) phasing, has been applied to the de novo determination of an unknown protein structure, that of the ""blue"" copper protein isolated from cucumber seedlings. This method makes use of crystallographic phases determined from measurements made at several wavelengths and has recently been made technically feasible through the use of intense, polychromatic synchrotron radiation together with accurate data collection from multiwire electronic area detectors. In contrast with all of the conventional methods of solving protein structures, which require either multiple isomorphous derivatives or coordinates of a similar structure for molecular replacement, this technique allows direct solution of the classical ""phase problem"" in x-ray crystallography. MAD phase assignment should be particularly useful for determining structures of small to medium-sized metalloproteins for which isomorphous derivatives are difficult or impossible to make. The structure of this particular protein provides new insights into the spectroscopic and redox properties of blue copper proteins, an important class of metalloproteins widely distributed in nature."
https://openalex.org/W1515792029,"The gene-specific upstream stimulatory transcription factor (USF) is required for maximal expression of the adenovirus major late promoter in vivo as well as in vitro. We have examined the DNA binding and transcriptional properties of USF purified to near-homogeneity from HeLa cell nuclei (Sawadogo, M., Van Dyke, M. W., Gregor, P. D., and Roeder, R. G. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 11985-11993). The 44-and 43,000-dalton forms of USF displayed identical affinities for the major late promoter upstream sequence. Specific binding parameters were greatly influenced by neighboring sequences, but not by the topological state of the DNA. The dissociation rate was highly dependent upon the concentration of competitor DNA, indicating that USF can efficiently transfer from one binding site to another by passing through a doubly bound intermediate state (direct transfer mechanism). Transcription stimulation by purified USF showed titration curves identical to those observed with cruder preparations of the transcription factor. However, the overall stimulation observed at saturating USF concentration was significantly lower with the purified protein. By contrast, interaction with TATA box-binding RNA polymerase II transcription factor D was observed with both USF-containing fractions. This could suggest the existence of two different mechanisms for upstream sequence-dependent transcription stimulation, where one critical component (or some necessary modification of the upstream factor itself) may be missing in reactions reconstituted with purified USF."

https://openalex.org/W2039247251,"The myosin light chain kinase requires calmodulin for activation. Tryptic cleavage of the enzyme generates an inactive 64-kilodalton (kD) fragment that can be further cleaved to form a constitutively active, calmodulin-independent, 61-kD fragment. Microsequencing and amino acid analysis of purified peptides after proteolysis of the 61- and 64-kD fragments were used to determine the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal sequences of the 64-kD fragment. Cleavage within the calmodulin-binding region at Arg505 generates the catalytically inactive 64-kD fragment, which is incapable of binding calmodulin. Further digestion removes a carboxyl-terminal fragment, including the pseudosubstrate sequence Ser484-Lys-Asp-Arg-Met-Lys-Lys-Tyr-Met- Ala-Arg-Arg-Lys-Trp-Gln-Lys-Thr-Gly-His-Ala-Val-Arg505 and results in a calmodulin-independent 61-kD fragment. Both the 61- and 64-kD fragments have the same primary amino-terminal sequences. These results provide direct support for the concept that the pseudosubstrate structure binds the active site and that the role of calmodulin is to modulate this interaction. Pseudosubstrates may be utilized in analogous ways by other allosterically regulated enzymes."

https://openalex.org/W1488647065,"Ellman's reagent was used to induce an oxidative stimulus on the exofacial membrane sulfhydryl groups of the human erythrocyte. Thiol-disulfide exchange occurring extracellularly was monitored using resonance Raman spectroscopy, and intracellular changes were observed by 1H spin echo nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the intact cell. The stimulus caused oxidation and depletion of the glutathione pool, which was followed at higher concentrations of Ellman's reagent by a depletion of intracellular ergothioneine levels. Larger changes are induced intracellularly than would be expected from the stoichiometry of the reaction at the exofacial surface. A mechanism is proposed which links exofacial sulfhydryl receptor sites via the transport proteins to spectrin and glutathione. The consequences for the cellular redox balance of an extracellular stimulus of this type are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1981700569,"Cell contraction and relaxation were measured in single voltage-clamped guinea pig cardiomyocytes to investigate the contribution of sarcolemmal Na+-Ca2+ exchange to mechanical relaxation. Cells clamped from -80 to 0 millivolts displayed initial phasic and subsequent tonic contractions; caffeine reduced or abolished the phasic and enlarged the tonic contraction. The rate of relaxation from tonic contractions was steeply voltage-dependent and was significantly slowed in the absence of a sarcolemmal Na+ gradient. Tonic contractions elicited in the absence of a Na+ gradient promptly relaxed when external Na+ was applied, reflecting activation of Na+-Ca2+ exchange. It appears that a voltage-dependent Na+-Ca2+ exchange can rapidly mechanically relax mammalian heart muscle."
https://openalex.org/W2065749107,"In this report it is shown that the PHT1-1 line of transgenic mice exhibited a pattern of developmental abnormalities when the mice were homozygous for the transgene insertion. Hindlimbs were uniformly truncated at the distal end of the femur, resulting in a ""legless"" appearance. Forelimbs lacked anterior structures including digits and the radius. The brains had many defects, particularly in the anterior structures of the cerebrum, including the olfactory lobes. Craniofacial malformations in the form of facial clefts also commonly occurred. Furthermore, heterozygotes of this line, with only one copy of the DNA insertion, and other transgenic lines carrying the same DNA construct appeared normal, suggesting that in the PHT1-1 line a gene significant in mammalian development has been disrupted."
https://openalex.org/W1555103147,"In glutathione redox buffers, rat liver, microsomal 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase rapidly equilibrates between a reduced, active form and an oxidized, inactive form. At pH 7.0, 37 degrees C, the second order rate constant for inactivation of the reduced enzyme by GSSG is 1700 +/- 200 M-1 min-1, approximately 20-fold faster than the reaction of GSSG with a typical, unhindered thiol of pKa 7.7. High concentrations of GSH or lower concentrations of dithiothreitol restore the activity of the oxidized enzyme. The oxidation of the enzyme by GSSG is only 30-fold slower in the presence of saturating levels of both substrates. The incomplete inhibition of thiol/disulfide exchange by substrates can lead to significant changes in the activity of the enzyme during the assay when glutathione is present. At redox equilibrium, both in the absence and presence of substrates, the activity of the enzyme depends on the quantity [GSH]2/[GSSG], suggesting that the redox transition involves the formation of a protein-SS-protein disulfide. The equilibrium constant for the reaction HMGRred + GSSG in equilibrium HMGRox + 2 GSH is 0.55 +/- 0.07 M in the absence of substrates and 0.20 +/- 0.02 M in the presence of saturating levels of both substrates. Thus, HMG-CoA reductase is very sensitive to dithiol oxidation both kinetically and thermodynamically. Significant changes in the oxidation state and activity of this enzyme could be expected to result from normal changes in the thiol/disulfide oxidation state of the cellular glutathione redox buffer."
https://openalex.org/W1540246217,"The light-activated NADP-malate dehydrogenase (NADP-MDH) catalyzes the reduction of oxaloacetate to malate in higher plant chloroplasts. This enzyme is regulated in vivo by the ferredoxin-thioredoxin system through redox reactions. NADP-MDH has been photoactivated in vitro in a chloroplast system reconstituted from the pure protein components and thylakoid membranes. Photoactivation was accompanied by the appearance of new thiol groups (followed by [14C]iodoacetate incorporation). 14C-Carboxymethylated NADP-MDH has been purified from the incubation mixture and its amino-terminal sequence analyzed. Two [14C]carboxymethylcysteines were identified at positions 10 and 15 after light activation, while they were not detected in the dark-treated protein. In addition, the analysis of the tryptic digest of light-activated [14C]carboxymethylated NADP-MDH revealed that the radioactive label was mostly incorporated in Cys10 and Cys15, indicating that these 2 residues play a major role in the light activation mechanism. Moreover, an activation model, in which photoreduced thio-redoxin was replaced by the dithiol reductant dithio-threitol, has been developed. When NADP-MDH was activated in this way, the same sulfhydryls were found to be labeled, and alternatively, they did not incorporate any radioactivity when dithiothreitol reduction was performed after carboxymethylation in denaturating conditions. These results indicate that activation (by light or by dithiothreitol) proceeds on each subunit by reduction of a disulfide bridge located at the amino terminus of the enzyme between Cys10 and Cys15."
https://openalex.org/W2405211893,"We have studied the molecular composition of the nuclear lamina in rat tissues of distinct embryological origin and the occurrence of the nuclear lamins during in vitro differentiation of the mouse F9 teratocarcinoma cell line. Immunochemical analysis demonstrated that all rat tissues contained the three major lamin forms (lamins A, B, and C) previously recognized in rat liver nuclei; however, other minor cross-reactive components were also identified in some tissues. The amount of the 67-kDa lamin B complexed with lamins A and C in the laminae of different tissues ranged from a stoichiometry of much less than 1 to approximately 1. Furthermore, it was found that F9 stem cells and their differentiated progeny express only lamin B, and Northern blotting analysis indicated that these cells fail to accumulate lamin A and C mRNA. Chemical cleavages and peptide mapping suggested that the 67-kDa lamin B form was of similar primary structure in all differentiated tissues and F9 cells. Employing antibodies with different affinities for phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated lamin B, we showed that the apparent invariance in the expression of this polypeptide is overriden by a heterogeneity produced via tissue-specific phosphorylation. Because similar differences in antibody recognition could be reproduced in vitro by phosphorylating lamin B with protein kinase A, we have concluded that the tissue-specific modifications of this protein may occur at consensus sites recognized by this enzyme. These data support the hypotheses that the lamins can form functional laminae by associating at various combinations, and that processes including differential lamin synthesis and post-translational modification can produce a steady state lamina heterogeneity."
https://openalex.org/W1504512890,"Primary cultures of adult rat hepatocytes grown in serum-free hormonally defined medium were shown, for the first time, to be capable of supporting the 3-methylcholanthrene-inducible expression of cytochrome P-450d. Such cultures were used to investigate the mechanism of the induction of cytochrome P-450c and P-450d mRNAs. After 1 day of growth in culture, P-450c and P-450d mRNAs were induced 33- and 28-fold, respectively, by 3-methylcholanthrene treatment. A similar magnitude of induction was achieved after 2-5 days growth in culture. However, the relative abundance of the two mRNAs before and after treatment decreased linearly over the 5-day time course. Kinetic analysis revealed that induction of both genes was rapid and could be observed less than 2 h following treatment. Accumulation of both mRNAs was linear for 8 h, reaching a plateau by 12 h. Expression then remained constant for at least 12 additional hours. In vitro nuclear run-on experiments revealed a 3.9- and 2.0-fold transcriptional induction of the P-450c and P-450d genes, respectively. This is in contrast to the large induction of accumulation of these mRNAs observed at steady state. Thus, the 3-methylcholanthrene induction of P-450c and P-450d mRNAs in the hepatocyte cultures appeared to be mediated primarily at the post-transcriptional level. Experiments on rat liver showed that, in vivo, P-450d is also regulated primarily at the post-transcriptional level. However, P-450c was found to be regulated primarily transcriptionally."
https://openalex.org/W1568944399,"The mechanisms by which thyroid hormones increase hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase mRNA levels were investigated in hypophysectomized rats. Feeding these rats a diet supplemented with 0.5% desiccated porcine thyroid powder resulted in a 5-fold increase in the rate of transcription of the HMG-CoA reductase gene as measured by in vitro run-on transcription assays in isolated rat liver nuclei. Time courses of change in reductase mRNA, showing the kinetics of approach to new steady-state levels, indicate that reductase mRNA is also 4-6-fold more stable in thyroid hormone-treated animals than in non-treated animals. Reductase mRNA decayed with a half-life of 2.5 h when mevinolin, a potent inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, and colestipol, a bile acid sequesterant, were removed from the diet of hypophysectomized rats. When these drugs were removed from the diet of thyroid hormone-treated hypophysectomized rats, reductase mRNA decayed with a half-life of 15 h. Treating rats with only mevinolin and colestipol increased reductase mRNA levels without stabilizing the mRNA. Administration of cycloheximide to thyroid hormone treated rats rapidly decreased HMG-CoA reductase mRNA levels by destabilizing reductase mRNA and decreasing reductase gene transcription. Cycloheximide treatment had no effect on beta-actin gene transcription or steady state levels of beta-actin mRNA. These results suggest that a short-lived protein(s) may mediate the transcriptional and post-transcriptional effects of thyroid hormones on HMG-CoA reductase mRNA levels."
https://openalex.org/W1487675143,"Ion exchange chromatography at high pH with pulsed amperometric detection of the eluted glycans permitted resolution of the eight major components in the mixture of asparagine-linked glycans derived from the single glycosylation site of ovalbumin. The individual glycans were first partially separated according to size, and were characterized by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry and specific enzymatic degradation with beta-galactosidase and endoglycosidase H; subnanomolar quantities of all eight components could subsequently be unequivocally identified in the elution diagram. To ascertain that the chromatographic separation of the ovalbumin glycan mixture was not restricted to the asparagine-linked glycans, it was established that the corresponding mixture of reducing oligosaccharides (asparagine removed) or Asn-oligosaccharides blocked at the alpha-amino group with biotin gave very similar resolution of the eight glycans. In the absence of pure reference compounds, the quantification of the different glycans by the amperometric detection system was evaluated by comparing the electrochemical signal to the molecular ion peak intensity in the mass spectrometer. With one exception, the two methods were in good agreement, which suggests that the amperometric detection system yields a valid quantitative estimate for most of these chemically related compounds."
https://openalex.org/W1510985467,"Egg laying in Aplysia is mediated by a battery of neuropeptides released from the bag cell neurons. Predominant intermediates in the proteolytic processing of the Aplysia egg-laying hormone neuropeptide precursor were characterized using biochemical and immunological techniques. Following removal of the signal peptide, a rapid cleavage at the tetrabasic sequence Arg-Arg-Lys-Arg separates the amino and carboxyl regions of the prohormone. Processing of the carboxyl-terminal portion of the precursor then proceeds rapidly via two further cleavages at dibasic residues, resulting in a well defined product mixture within 4 h of chase. By contrast, processing of the amino-terminal side of the molecule proceeds only partially to completion after 20 h of chase and a well defined set of intermediates is not observed. Molecular genetic, physiological, and behavioral studies in conjunction with the biochemical investigations presented here are defining the information flow which governs the egg-laying behavior of Aplysia."

https://openalex.org/W2082279174,"Previous studies have shown that adrenalectomy augments arginine vasopressin (AVP) messenger RNA levels in the adult paraventricular nucleus. It is now demonstrated that unilateral lesions in the lateral septal nucleus enhance the adrenalectomy-induced expression of AVP mRNA. This effect was entirely ipsilateral to the lesion and most prominent in the rostral paraventricular nucleus and related nuclei. Moreover, AVP and AVP mRNA were found to be colocalized with oxytocin in a few neurons. These results indicate that mRNA expression is modulated by synaptic influences and raise the possibility that synaptically mediated selection of neuronal phenotypes is a dynamic feature of the mature central nervous system."

https://openalex.org/W1515549528,A plasmid containing the mouse interferon-alpha 1 gene under control of the mouse metallothionein-I promoter was used for the construction of transgenic mice. Four transgenic mice (two males and two females) were obtained containing 1 to over 10 copies of the introduced DNA. Both males appeared to be sterile. One of the female mice founded a transgenic strain in which the foreign DNA was transmitted to her offspring in a Mendelian fashion. In this strain most male animals are sterile or turn sterile with time. Northern blot analysis of several tissues of these animals shows that expression of the introduced interferon gene occurs only in the testis. In some of the animals biologically active interferon could also be detected in testes homogenates. Histological examination of testis tissue shows an ongoing degeneration of spermatogenic cells leading to calcium deposits and complete atrophy of the seminiferous tubules.

https://openalex.org/W1606799494,"Structurally abnormal type I collagen was identified in tissues and cultured fibroblasts from a case of lethal perinatal osteogenesis imperfecta. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of the CNBr peptides demonstrated that the alpha 1(I)CB7 peptide from the alpha 1(I) chain of type I collagen existed in a normal form and a mutant form with a more basic charge distribution (Bateman, J. F., Mascara, T., Chan, D., and Cole, W. G. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 4445-4451). Sequencing of cloned alpha 1(I) cDNAs prepared using mRNA from the patient's fibroblasts demonstrated that one clone had a single base substitution of A for G which resulted in the substitution of arginine for glycine 664 within the alpha 1(I)CB7 peptide. To determine whether this mutation was responsible for the peptide map abnormality, in vitro transcription of mRNA from the mutant cDNA was performed using an SP6 vector system. The mRNA was then translated into mutant protein in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Peptide analysis of the protein produced from the mutant cDNA demonstrated the same altered charge distribution of the alpha 1(I)CB7 peptide as observed with tissue- and cell-derived mutant collagen peptides. This finding confirmed that the arginine for glycine 664 sequence abnormality defined in the cDNA clone was the mutation causing the observed protein peptide map defect. This mutation is consistent with the functional abnormalities of collagen observed in this case such as reduced helical stability, reduced secretion, increased degradation, and excessive posttranslational modification of lysine."

All the identified cleavages occurred either COOH-terminal to or between pairs of basic amino acids, with plasma kallikrein recognizing Lys-Lys, Lys-Arg, and Arg-Arg as processing signals. Moreover, plasma kallikrein was found to cleave at the COOH terminus of the basic pairs of amino acids preceding enkephalin sequences thereby releasing the biologically active form of the peptide with the free NH2-terminal Tyr needed for receptor recognition."
https://openalex.org/W1542124038,"Neutral glycolipids in PC12 cells were examined. A major neutral glycosphingolipid, isolated from a chloroform/methanol extract of the cells, was found to contain only galactose and glucose at a ratio of 3:1 and identified as ceramide tetrahexoside by fast atom bombardment (FAB) mass spectrometry. Its saccharide sequence was determined by a new method developed here using endoglycoceramidase (Ito, M., and Yamagata, T. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 14278-14282). The glycosphingolipid was digested with endoglycoceramidase to produce oligosaccharide which was subsequently pyridylaminated. The fluorescence-labeled oligosaccharide was digested with a series of specific exoglycosidases and fractionated by high performance liquid chromatography. The 2-aminopyridyl oligosaccharide was hydrolyzed by alpha-galactosidase to give a 2-aminopyridyl oligosaccharide which was identified as 2-aminopyridyl lactose by high performance liquid chromatography, indicating the glycolipid structure to be Gal alpha Gal alpha Gal beta GlcCer. Ceramide trihexoside obtained by limited digestion of the intact glycolipid was clearly identical with ceramide trihexoside obtained from human erythrocytes, according to NMR spectroscopy and methylation analysis. From these and other data on the intact glycolipid, obtained by methylation analysis and NMR spectroscopy, its structure was confirmed as Gal alpha 1-3Gal alpha 1-4Gal beta 1-4Glc beta 1-1Cer, III3-Gal alpha-globotriaosylceramide.

https://openalex.org/W1554306015,"We re-examined the electrical and stoichiometric properties of the Na+-L-lactate cotransporter using highly purified brush-border membrane vesicles prepared from the whole cortex of rabbit kidney. A valinomycin-induced K+ diffusion potential (interior-negative) stimulated Na+ gradient-dependent L-lactate uptake. However, this stimulation reflected catalytic rather than energetic activation as an inside-negative membrane potential did not induce net uphill lactate accumulation in the presence of Na+ but in the absence of a Na+ concentration gradient. Additional evidence for electroneutrality of the cotransporter was the finding that, under voltage-clamped conditions, L-lactate flux was a hyperbolic function of extravesicular Na+ concentration with a Hill coefficient (n) of 1.0. Moreover, the plot of V/[Na+]n versus V was linear for n = 1, indicating that one Na+ ion is co-transported with an anionic lactate1- molecule. Finally, addition of L-lactate to vesicles under Na+ equilibrium conditions failed to generate an inside-positive membrane potential as monitored by 3,3'-dipropylthiodicarbocyanine iodide fluorescence quenching, arguing against Na+-L-lactate cotransport by an electrogenic process. Taken together, these data indicate that the luminal Na+-L-lactate co-transporter is electroneutral with a stoichiometry of 1."

https://openalex.org/W1541328642,"The mode of attachment of the membrane-bound form of the chromaffin granule glycoprotein dopamine beta-hydroxylase has been investigated; specifically, the possibility of a covalently attached glycosyl phosphatidylinositol anchor has been examined in detail. Incubation of fragmented chromaffin granule membranes with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C led to no solubilization of dopamine beta-hydroxylase activity. Further, chemical analyses of the inositol and phosphate content of the soluble form of dopamine beta-hydroxylase indicate that the enzyme contains no covalently attached phosphate or inositol. The results of these studies allow elimination of phosphatidylinositol as a source of membrane anchoring for dopamine beta-hydroxylase and, coupled with previously available data, argue against a post-translational covalent modification of the enzyme as the mechanism of membrane attachment. Possible alternative models for the anchoring of membranous dopamine beta-hydroxylase are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1511880678,"Hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (refers to hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase from any species in general) has been purified to apparent homogeneity from the teleost fish Fundulus heteroclitus. The enzyme was characterized for native (210 kDa) and subunit molecular mass (54 kDa), isoelectric point (6.65), amino acid composition, substrate specificity, and metal dependence. Glucose 6-phosphate, galactose 6-phosphate, 2-deoxyglucose 6-phosphate, glucose 6-sulfate, glucosamine 6-phosphate, and glucose were found to be substrates in the reaction with NADP+, but only glucose was a substrate when NAD+ was used as coenzyme. A unique reaction mechanism for the forward direction was found for this enzyme when glucose 6-phosphate and NADP+ were used as substrates; ordered with glucose 6-phosphate binding first. NAD+ was found to be a competitive inhibitor toward NADP+ and an uncompetitive inhibitor with regard to glucose 6-phosphate in this reaction; Vmax = 7.56 mumol/min/mg, Km(NADP+) = 1.62 microM, Km(glucose 6-phosphate) = 7.29 microM, Kia(glucose 6-phosphate) = 8.66 microM, and Ki(NAD+) = 0.49 microM. The use of alternative substrates confirmed this result. This type of reaction mechanism has not been previously reported for a dehydrogenase."
https://openalex.org/W1591676294,"It has been shown previously that chicken ovalbumin synthesized and secreted in a heterologous cell system is glycosylated at the correct site and that the oligosaccharides at that site, similar to the protein made in hen oviduct, are predominantly of the hybrid type (Sheares, B. T., and Robbins, P. W. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 83, 1993-1997). This site-specific glycosylation of Asn293, but not Asn312, suggested a prominent role for the nascent protein chain rather than the specific cell type in directing the proper attachment of oligosaccharide chains. In the present study, the effect of glycosylation at Asn293 on the glycosylation of Asn312 has been investigated. Using a 20-base oligodeoxynucleotide primer containing a 2-base mismatch, the codon for Asn293 in the chicken ovalbumin gene (AAC) was changed to that for Gln (CAA), thereby preventing glycosylation at amino acid 293. Constructions containing this mutation were transfected into mouse L (tk-) cells which were subsequently labeled with [35S]methionine. Ovalbumin secreted by these cells was recovered by immunoaffinity chromatography and analyzed for the presence of an oligosaccharide attached at Asn312. Treatment of the material with peptide:N-glycosidase F demonstrated that ovalbumin molecules containing Gln substituted for Asn293 were not glycosylated. This further supports our earlier hypothesis that the nascent protein chain is responsible for directing site-specific glycosylation of ovalbumin, and that the presence of an oligosaccharide chain at the first site has no influence on glycosylation at the second site."

Crystals are obtained by a change in pH and ionic strength using Na2CO3. They can also be obtained by a change in ionic strength only using NaBr as the precipitant. The space group of both forms is C222(1) with a = 133, b = 116, c = 104 A and one molecule/asymmetric unit. Still photographs show reflections to 3.0-A resolution."
