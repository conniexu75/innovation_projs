https://openalex.org/W1986366581,"Several flavin-dependent enzymes of the mitochondrial matrix utilize NAD(+) or NADH at about the same operating redox potential as the NADH/NAD(+) pool and comprise the NADH/NAD(+) isopotential enzyme group. Complex I (specifically the flavin, site IF) is often regarded as the major source of matrix superoxide/H2O2 production at this redox potential. However, the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH), branched-chain 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH), and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complexes are also capable of considerable superoxide/H2O2 production. To differentiate the superoxide/H2O2-producing capacities of these different mitochondrial sites in situ, we compared the observed rates of H2O2 production over a range of different NAD(P)H reduction levels in isolated skeletal muscle mitochondria under conditions that favored superoxide/H2O2 production from complex I, the OGDH complex, the BCKDH complex, or the PDH complex. The rates from all four complexes increased at higher NAD(P)H/NAD(P)(+) ratios, although the 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase complexes produced superoxide/H2O2 at high rates only when oxidizing their specific 2-oxoacid substrates and not in the reverse reaction from NADH. At optimal conditions for each system, superoxide/H2O2 was produced by the OGDH complex at about twice the rate from the PDH complex, four times the rate from the BCKDH complex, and eight times the rate from site IF of complex I. Depending on the substrates present, the dominant sites of superoxide/H2O2 production at the level of NADH may be the OGDH and PDH complexes, but these activities may often be misattributed to complex I."

We hypothesized that different pathophysiologic insults would produce characteristic patterns of released glycocalyx fragments. We collected plasma from healthy donors as well as from subjects with respiratory failure due to altered mental status (intoxication, ischemic brain injury), indirect lung injury (non-pulmonary sepsis, pancreatitis), or direct lung injury (aspiration, pneumonia). Mass spectrometry was employed to determine the quantity and sulfation patterns of circulating glycosaminoglycans. We found that circulating heparan sulfate fragments were significantly (23-fold) elevated in patients with indirect lung injury, while circulating hyaluronic acid concentrations were elevated (32-fold) in patients with direct lung injury. N-Sulfation and tri-sulfation of heparan disaccharides were significantly increased in patients with indirect lung injury. Chondroitin disaccharide sulfation was suppressed in all groups with respiratory failure. Plasma heparan sulfate concentrations directly correlated with intensive care unit length of stay. Serial plasma measurements performed in select patients revealed that circulating highly sulfated heparan fragments persisted for greater than 3 days after the onset of respiratory failure. Our findings demonstrate that circulating glycosaminoglycans are elevated in patterns characteristic of the etiology of respiratory failure and may serve as diagnostic and/or prognostic biomarkers of critical illness.

https://openalex.org/W2093187956,"Abnormal blood cell production is associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Bone-derived FGF-23 (fibroblast growth factor-23) regulates phosphate homeostasis and bone mineralization. Genetic deletion of Fgf-23 in mice (Fgf-23(-/-)) results in hypervitaminosis D, abnormal mineral metabolism, and reduced lymphatic organ size. Elevated FGF-23 levels are linked to CKD and greater risk of CVD, left ventricular hypertrophy, and mortality in dialysis patients. However, whether FGF-23 is involved in the regulation of erythropoiesis is unknown. Here we report that loss of FGF-23 results in increased hematopoietic stem cell frequency associated with increased erythropoiesis in peripheral blood and bone marrow in young adult mice. In particular, these hematopoietic changes are also detected in fetal livers, suggesting that they are not the result of altered bone marrow niche alone. Most importantly, administration of FGF-23 in wild-type mice results in a rapid decrease in erythropoiesis. Finally, we show that the effect of FGF-23 on erythropoiesis is independent of the high vitamin D levels in these mice. Our studies suggest a novel role for FGF-23 in erythrocyte production and differentiation and suggest that elevated FGF-23 levels contribute to the pathogenesis of anemia in patients with CKD and CVD."
https://openalex.org/W1982252060,"The majority of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) cases as well as many patients suffering from frontotemporal lobar dementia (FTLD) with ubiquitinated inclusion bodies show TDP-43 pathology, the protein encoded by the TAR DNA-binding protein (Tardbp) gene. We used recombinase-mediated cassette exchange to introduce an ALS patient cDNA into the mouse Tdp-43 locus. Expression levels of human A315T TDP-43 protein were 300% elevated in heterozygotes, whereas the endogenous mouse Tdp-43 was decreased to 20% of wild type levels as a result of disturbed feedback regulation. Heterozygous TDP-43(A315TKi) mutants lost 10% of their body weight and developed insoluble TDP-43 protein starting as early as 3 months after birth, a pathology that was exacerbated with age. We analyzed the splicing patterns of known Tdp-43 target genes as well as genome-wide gene expression levels in different tissues that indicated mitochondrial dysfunction. In heterozygous mutant animals, we observed a relative decrease in expression of Parkin (Park2) and the fatty acid transporter CD36 along with an increase in fatty acids, HDL cholesterol, and glucose in the blood. As seen in transmission electron microscopy, neuronal cells in motor cortices of TDP-43(A315TKi) animals had abnormal neuronal mitochondrial cristae formation. Motor neurons were reduced to 90%, but only slight motoric impairment was detected. The observed phenotype was interpreted as a predisease model, which might be valuable for the identification of further environmental or genetic triggers of neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2086517869,"Anoectochilus roxburghii was grown under different shade treatments–50%, 30%, 20%, and 5% of natural irradiance–to evaluate its photosynthetic characteristics, chloroplast ultrastructure, and physiology. The highest net photosynthetic rates and stomatal conductance were observed under 30% irradiance, followed in descending order by 20%, 5%, and 50% treatments. As irradiance decreased from 50% to 30%, electron transport rate and photochemical quenching increased, while non-photochemical quenching indexes declined. Reductions in irradiance significantly increased Chl a and Chl b contents and decreased Chl a/b ratios. Chloroplast ultrastructure generally displayed the best development in leaves subjected to 30% irradiance. Under 50% irradiance, leaf protein content remained relatively stable during the first 20 days of treatment, and then increased rapidly. The highest peroxidase and superoxide dismutase levels, and the lowest catalase activities, were observed in plants subjected to the 50% irradiance treatment. Soluble sugar and malondialdehyde contents were positively correlated with irradiance levels. Modulation of chloroplast development, accomplished by increasing the number of thylakoids and grana containing photosynthetic pigments, is an important shade tolerance mechanism in A. roxburghii."
https://openalex.org/W2142822714,"Transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4), a calcium-permeable channel, is highly expressed in the apical membrane of choroid plexus epithelial cells (CPECs) in the brain. The function of TRPV4 is unknown. Here, we show physical and functional interaction between TRPV4 and anoctamin 1 (ANO1) in HEK293T cells and CPECs. Chloride currents induced by a TRPV4 activator (GSK1016790A) were markedly increased in an extracellular calcium-dependent manner in HEK293T cells expressing TRPV4 with ANO1, but not with ANO4, ANO6, or ANO10, the mRNAs of which were expressed in the choroid plexus. We also found physical interaction between TRPV4 and ANO1 in both HEK293T cells and choroid plexus. We observed that ANO1 was activated at a warm temperature (37°C) in HEK293T cells and that the heat-evoked chloride currents were markedly enhanced after GSK1016790A application in CPECs. Simultaneous stimulation by warmth and hyposmosis induced chloride current activation in wild-type, but not in TRPV4-deficient, CPECs. Cell volume changes were induced by ANO1-mediated chloride currents in parallel with membrane potential changes, and the cell volume was significantly decreased at negative membrane potentials by TRPV4-induced ANO1 activation. Thus, physical and functional interactions between TRPV4 and ANO1 can modulate water transport in the choroid plexus.—Takayama, Y., Shibasaki, K., Suzuki, Y., Yamanaka, A., Tominaga, M.

https://openalex.org/W2152322205,"The 10 Plasmodium 6-Cys proteins have critical roles throughout parasite development and are targets for antimalaria vaccination strategies. We analyzed the conserved 6-cysteine domain of this family and show that only the last 4 positionally conserved cysteine residues are diagnostic for this domain and identified 4 additional “6-Cys family-related” proteins. Two of these, sequestrin and B9, are critical to Plasmodium liver-stage development. RT-PCR and immunofluorescence assays show that B9 is translationally repressed in sporozoites and is expressed after hepatocyte invasion where it localizes to the parasite plasma membrane. Mutants lacking B9 expression in the rodent malaria parasites P. berghei and P. yoelii and the human parasite P. falciparum developmentally arrest in hepatocytes. P. berghei mutants arrest in the livers of BALB/c (100%) and C57BL6 mice (>99.9%), and in cultures of Huh7 human-hepatoma cell line. Similarly, P. falciparum mutants while fully infectious to primary human hepatocytes abort development 3 d after infection. This growth arrest is associated with a compromised parasitophorous vacuole membrane a phenotype similar to, but distinct from, mutants lacking the 6-Cys sporozoite proteins P52 and P36. Our results show that 6-Cys proteins have critical but distinct roles in establishment and maintenance of a parasitophorous vacuole and subsequent liver-stage development—Annoura, T., van Schaijk, B.

The interaction of TRAIL with death receptor 4 (DR4) and DR5 can trigger apoptotic cell death. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of TRAIL signaling in neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI). Using a neonatal mouse model of HI, mRNA, and protein expression of TRAIL, DR5 and the TRAIL decoy receptors osteoprotegerin (OPG), mDcTRAILR1, and mDcTRAILR2 were determined. In vitro, mRNA expression of these genes was measured in primary neurons and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) after inflammatory cytokine (TNF-α/IFN-γ) treatment and/or oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD). The toxicity of these various paradigms was also measured. The expression of TRAIL, DR5, OPG, and mDcTRAILR2 was significantly increased after HI. In vitro, inflammatory cytokines and OGD treatment significantly induced mRNAs for TRAIL, DR5, OPG, and mDcTRAILR2 in primary neurons and of TRAIL and OPG in OPCs. TRAIL protein was expressed primarily in microglia and astroglia, whereas DR5 co-localized with neurons and OPCs in vivo. OGD enhanced TNF-α/IFN-γ toxicity in both neuronal and OPC cultures. Recombinant TRAIL exerted toxicity alone or in combination with OGD and TNF-α/IFN-γ in primary neurons but not in OPC cultures. The marked increases in the expression of TRAIL and its receptors after cytokine exposure and OGD in primary neurons and OPCs were similar to those found in our animal model of neonatal HI.

https://openalex.org/W2024843967,"In many developing countries including Ethiopia, maternal morbidity and mortality still pose a substantial burden and thus progress towards the fifth Millennium Development Goal (MDG) remains slow. Raising awareness of women about the danger signs of pregnancy and childbirth is the first essential step in accepting appropriate and timely referral to obstetric care. However, in Ethiopia little is known about the knowledge level of mothers about obstetric danger signs. The objective of this study was to assess the status of knowledge of danger signs of pregnancy and childbirth among mothers who gave birth in the past two years prior to the survey in Tsegedie district, Tigray regional state, Ethiopia.A Community based cross-sectional study was conducted from November 20, 2012 to June 30, 2013 on a randomly selected sample of 485 women who had at least one delivery in the past two years. Multistage sampling technique was employed to select the study participants. A pre-tested structured questionnaire was used to collect quantitative data. Focus group discussion and in-depth interviews were utilized to supplement the Quantitative data. Bivariate and multivariate data analysis was performed using SPSS version 17.0 software.Four hundred eighty five mothers participated in the study making a response rate of 100%. Vaginal bleeding was the most commonly mentioned danger signs of pregnancy (49.1%) and childbirth (52.8%). Two hundred eighty five (58.8%) and 299 (61.6%) of respondents mentioned at least two danger signs of pregnancy and childbirth respectively. One hundred seventy (35.1%) and 154 (31.8%) of respondents didn't know any danger signs of pregnancy and childbirth respectively. Educational status of the mother, place of delivery and having functional radio were found to be independent predictors of knowledge of women about the danger signs of pregnancy and childbirth.Educational status of the mother, place of delivery and having functional radio were independently associated with knowledge of women about obstetric danger signs. Thus, provision of information, education and communication targeting women, family and the general community on danger signs of pregnancy and childbirth and associated factors was recommended."

Importantly, this E2-induced metabolic flare is predictive of the clinical effectiveness of anti-estrogens and, as a result, downstream metabolic regulators of E2 are expected to have utility as targets for the development of anti-breast cancer agents. The family of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatases (PFKFB1–4) control glycolytic flux via their product, fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F26BP), which activates 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK-1). We postulated that E2 might promote PFKFB3 expression, resulting in increased F26BP and glucose uptake. We demonstrate that PFKFB3 expression is highest in stage III lymph node metastases relative to normal breast tissues and that exposure of human MCF-7 breast cancer cells to E2 causes a rapid increase in [14C]glucose uptake and glycolysis that is coincident with an induction of PFKFB3 mRNA (via ER binding to its promoter), protein expression and the intracellular concentration of its product, F26BP. Importantly, selective inhibition of PFKFB3 expression and activity using siRNA or a PFKFB3 inhibitor markedly reduces the E2-mediated increase in F26BP, [14C]glucose uptake, and glycolysis. Furthermore, co-treatment of MCF-7 cells with the PFKFB3 inhibitor and the anti-estrogen ICI 182,780 synergistically induces apoptotic cell death. These findings demonstrate for the first time that the estrogen receptor directly promotes PFKFB3 mRNA transcription which, in turn, is required for the glucose metabolism and survival of breast cancer cells.

The most potent activator of PFK-1 is a shunt product of glycolysis, fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F26BP), which can override the allosteric inhibition by ATP and stimulate PFK-1, glucose uptake, and flux through the entire glycolytic pathway (8.Van Schaftingen E.

E2, cycloheximide, and actinomycin D were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. ICI 182,780 (Fulvestrant) was purchased from Tocris. PFK158 was provided by Advanced Cancer Therapeutics. The compound consists of (E)-l-(pyridyn-4-yl)-3-(7-(trifluoromethyl)quinolin-2-yl)-prop-2-en-l-one. Antibodies against PFKFB3 and β-actin were purchased from Proteintech and Sigma-Aldrich, respectively. Whole cell lysates were harvested using Pierce lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors. Protein concentration was determined by the BCA method (Pierce). Proteins were separated on 10% Mini PROTEAN TGX gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TBS-T (0.1% Tween 20) and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. Amersham Biosciences ECL Western blotting detection reagent (GE Healthcare) was used to detect protein bands. The membranes were visualized on Biomax ML film (Kodak). MCF-7 and T-47D cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). MCF-7 cells were maintained in Improved Minimum Essential Medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and Pen-Strep (Invitrogen). T-47D cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 0.2 unit/ml bovine insulin. Cells were serum-starved (5% dextran-coated charcoal-stripped FBS) in phenol red-free media for 72 h prior to E2 treatments. Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy spin columns (Qiagen). Reverse transcription was performed by using random primers and the High Capacity cDNA Archive Kit (Applied Biosystems). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed with the ABI PRISM 7500 using TaqMan primers and probes for PFKFB3 and control gene β-actin purchased as Assays-on-DemandTM Gene Expression Products (Applied Biosystems). Analysis and -fold differences were determined using the comparative CT method. Unless otherwise indicated, -fold change was calculated from the ΔΔCT values with the formula 2-ΔΔCT. Experiments were repeated at least three times. Five-μm sections of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tumor tissue were mounted on charged glass slides and dried at 58 °C for 60 min. Slides were first deparaffinized with xylene, and then epitope retrieval was carried out using citrate buffer in a 2100 Retriever (PickCell Laboratories). The sections were blocked with 10% goat serum for 1 h, then incubated with primary antibody (anti-PFKFB3 1:50; Proteintech) overnight, followed by an HRP-linked goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:300; Pierce). The sections were developed with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB; Vector Laboratories) for 2 min, and nuclei were counterstained with hematoxylin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 min. PBS washes were performed between all steps. The slides were dehydrated in graded alcohols (100, 95, and 80% ethanol (v/v) in H2O) and cleared in xylene, and coverslips were attached with Permount (Fisher Scientific). Slides were scanned using a ScanScope XT Digital Slide Scanner (Aperio) and data analyzed with the positive pixel count algorithm (ImageScope; Aperio). ChIP experiments were performed using the simpleChIP kit (Cell Signaling) and following the manufacture's instructions. In brief, 107 MCF-7 cells/immunoprecipitation were treated with vehicle control EtOH or 10 nm E2 for 1 h. Chromatin was cross-linked by incubating the cells with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min. Immunoprecipitation of the lysed extracts was performed using the following ChIP grade antibodies: anti-ERα (HC-20), anti-ERβ (H-150) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, or normal rabbit IgG (Cell Signaling). The primers used for PCR of the PFKFB3 promoter region containing an ERE were: (−2023 to −2198), CGCGTTATTGACAGACAGGA (FWD)/AGCTCACAGGGAGAGCAGAG (REV), and (−2982 to −3308), CTCCTGAGCTCAAGCAATCC (FWD)/GGGTGCTGAGTGGAATCCTA (REV). As a positive control, primers flanking the established ERE in the human pS2 (trefoil factor 1 (TFF1)) gene promoter were used (17.Bourdeau V. Deschênes J. Métivier R. Nagai Y. Nguyen D.

Primers to a distal region (−9196 to −9432), AGTTGAATCGCTGCAAAGGT (FWD)/ACCCAGGTGAAATCAACAGC (REV) of the PFKFB3 promoter were used as a negative control. MCF-7 cells were treated with EtOH vehicle control, 10 or 100 nm E2 for the indicated times. Cells were washed in PBS and lysed in NaOH/Tris acetate by heating at 80 °C for 5 min. Lysates were neutralized to pH 7.2 by adding ice-cold acetic acid and HEPES. F26BP concentration was determined using the method described by Van Schaftingen et al. (9.Van Schaftingen E. Hue L. Hers H.G. Control of the fructose-6-phosphate/fructose 1,6-bisphosphate cycle in isolated hepatocytes by glucose and glucagon: role of a low-molecular-weight stimulator of phosphofructokinase.Biochem. J. 1980; 192: 887-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). MCF-7 cells were treated with EtOH vehicle control, 10 or 100 nm E2 for the indicated time periods and subsequently placed in glucose-free RPMI 1640 medium for 30 min. 2-[14C]Deoxyglucose (0.25 μCi/ml; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added for an additional 15 min, and cells were then washed three times with ice-cold RPMI 1640 medium containing no glucose. Cell lysates were collected in 500 μl of 0.1% SDS, and scintillation counts (counts/min) were measured using 350 μl of lysate. Protein concentration was determined using the BCA assay according to the manufacturer's instructions and measured on a Powerwave XS plate reader (Biotek). Counts were normalized to protein concentration. MCF-7 cells growing in 6-well plates were incubated in 500 μl of complete medium containing 1 μCi of 5-[3H]glucose for 60 min in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The medium was then collected and centrifuged for 5 min at 8000 rpm to pellet any cells. To separate the 3H2O formed via glycolysis from the 5-[3H]glucose added to the medium, an evaporation technique in a sealed system was utilized. Briefly, 150 μl of medium aliquots were added in open tubes that were placed upright inside scintillation vials containing 1 ml of H2O. The scintillation vials were sealed, and the 3H2O produced by glycolysis through enolase and released to the medium was allowed to equilibrate with the H2O in the outer vial for 48 h at 37 °C. The amounts of 3H2O that had diffused into the surrounding H2O was measured on a Tri-Carb 2910 liquid scintillation analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and compared with 3H2O and 5-[3H]glucose standards. Protein concentration was determined using the BCA assay according to the manufacturer's instructions and measured on a Powerwave XS plate reader. Counts were normalized to protein concentration. Cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well. Cells were transfected with control siRNA or PFKFB3 siRNA (Invitrogen) using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent (Invitrogen) and allowed to incubate for 48 h prior to E2 treatment. pAdenoG-HA (vector) and PFKFB3-HA adenovirus (human) were purchased from Applied Biological Materials. For infection experiments, MCF-7 cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well and allowed to attach overnight. The cells were then placed in 1 ml of medium containing 1 × 106 viral particles and allowed to incubate for 48 h. MCF-7 cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well and starved for 72 h prior to treatment. Cells were incubated with 10 nm E2 and dimethyl sulfoxide, 100 nm ICI 182,780, 5 μm PFK158 or the combination of ICI 182,780 and PFK158 for 24 h. Cells were washed with PBS and stained with Annexin V and PI (BD Pharmingen). Fluorescence was measured using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using FloJo (Tree Star). Annexin V−/PI − (live) and Annexin V+/PI + (late apoptotic) cells were quantified by the frequency of fluorescently labeled cells, and statistical significance was assessed by the two-sample t test (independent variable). Previously, PFKFB3 expression was found to be elevated in primary breast adenocarcinomas (12.Atsumi T. Chesney J. Metz C. Leng L. Donnelly S. Makita Z. Mitchell R. Bucala R. High expression of inducible 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (iPFK-2; PFKFB3) in human cancers.Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5881-5887PubMed Google Scholar). We confirmed high PFKFB3 expression in stage II breast adenocarcinomas relative to normal breast tissues using immunohistochemical analyses (Fig. 1A). We also examined the metastatic breast adenocarcinoma cells in lymph nodes resected from patients suffering from stage III breast cancer and observed an incremental increase in PFKFB3 protein expression (Fig. 1A). This increase in PFKFB3 expression in stage II and lymph node metastases then was statistically confirmed using digital immunohistochemical image analysis (Fig. 1B). Given that E2 increases the glucose uptake of ER+ breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo (6.Dehdashti F. Mortimer J.E. Trinkaus K. Naughton M.J. Ellis M. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Welch M.J.

Ventura F. Rosa J.L. Bartrons R. 6-Phosphofructo-2-kinase (pfkfb3) gene promoter contains hypoxia-inducible factor-1 binding sites necessary for transactivation in response to hypoxia.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53562-53570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), we postulated that ER and its ligand, E2, might regulate PFKFB3 mRNA expression. Initially, we examined PFKFB3 mRNA expression by real-time RT-PCR after exposure to EtOH (vehicle control), or 10 or 100 nm E2 for 1, 3, 6, and 24 h. We observed a marked increase in PFKFB3 mRNA levels after only 1 h of exposure to either 10 or 100 nm E2 (Fig. 2A). PFKFB3 mRNA returned to near basal levels after 3 and 6 h of incubation with E2 but was still statistically increased relative to the vehicle control (Fig. 2A). Importantly, co-culture with the anti-estrogen ICI 182,780 (ICI; 100 nm) blocked the induction of PFKFB3 mRNA indicating that the ER is required for the up-regulation of PFKFB3 mRNA expression (Fig. 2A). In addition, pretreatment of MCF-7 cells with the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D, suppressed the increase in PFKFB3 mRNA indicating that new mRNA synthesis is required whereas pretreatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, had no effect (Fig. 2A). We next examined endogenous PFKFB3 protein expression in response to E2 and found that PFKFB3 protein significantly increased after 3 h and 6 h of exposure to 10 or 100 nm E2 but returned to baseline after 24 h (Fig. 2, C and D). Similar to PFKFB3 protein, the steady-state concentration of its product, F26BP, significantly increased after 3 h and 6 h of exposure to 10 and 100 nm E2 (Fig. 2B). To then monitor the effect of E2 on glucose uptake, MCF-7 cells were placed in phenol red-free medium supplemented with 5% dextran-coated charcoal-stripped serum for 72 h prior to the addition of E2 and 2-[1-14C]deoxy-d-glucose (2-[14C]DG). We observed a time-dependent increase in glucose uptake in MCF-7 cells exposed to 10 and 100 nm E2 for 3–24 h (Fig. 2E). We next examined glycolysis by measuring the release of 3H2O from 5-[3H]glucose via enolase which is downstream of PFK-1 in the glycolytic pathway. We found that E2 also caused a marked increase in glycolysis by MCF-7 cells that coincided with the observed increase in glucose uptake (Fig. 2F). Given that the F26BP concentration returns to near baseline 6 h after stimulation by E2, we suspect that the maintenance of increased glucose metabolism observed at 24 h is mediated by secondary events that regulate glucose transporters and/or glycolytic enzymes. Importantly, we did not observe an increase in the mRNA expression of several key control steps in glycolysis including GLUT1–4, hexokinase, PFK-1, and pyruvate kinase at 24 h (data not shown). We also assessed PFKFB3 expression after 10 nm E2 exposure in a second ER+ breast cancer cell line (T-47D) and found that PFKFB3 mRNA and protein were increased 3.9-fold (1 h) and 3.0-fold (3 h), respectively (data not shown). We next analyzed the 5′ PFKFB3 promoter sequence using the TRANSFAC software (Biobase) to identify putative transcription factors binding sites, including the ER. Our analysis revealed four putative half-site ERE sites located around the −2000 and −3000 regions along with several SP1 sites. To investigate whether the E2-induced increase in PFKFB3 mRNA involves recruitment of the ER to the PFKFB3 promoter we performed ChIP assays using primers that could amplify the −2000, −3000, and a distal region of the PFKFB3 promoter. We used antibodies against ERα and ERβ to immunoprecipitate the chromatin collected from MCF-7 cells treated with 10 nm E2 for 1 h and then performed real-time quantitative PCR to determine recruitment to the PFKFB3 promoter. Our results demonstrate a 4-fold enrichment in the recruitment of the ERα to the −2000 region of the PFKFB3 promoter after 1 h of E2 exposure (Fig. 3A (real-time PCR) and Fig. 3B (2% agarose gel as a representative example)). We did not observe a significant recruitment of the ERα to the −3000 region or a distal region of the PFKFB3 gene which is devoid of putative EREs. We also observed no recruitment of the ERβ to the PFKFB3 gene and found that primers recognizing the pS2 promoter, a previously described ERα target (18.Liu X.F. Bagchi M.K. Recruitment of distinct chromatin-modifying complexes by tamoxifen-complexed estrogen receptor at natural target gene promoters in vivo.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15050-15058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), amplified the pS2 promoter sequence as a positive control. In summary, these studies demonstrate that stimulation of MCF-7 cells with 10 nm E2 for 1 h causes an increase in ERα recruitment to the PFKFB3 promoter. To determine whether the stimulation of glucose uptake by E2 requires PFKFB3 expression, we next analyzed E2-stimulated glucose uptake by MCF-7 cells transfected with a control or PFKFB3-specific siRNA. Briefly, MCF-7 cells were transiently transfected with either control siRNA or PFKFB3 siRNA, and, 48 h later the cells were exposed to vehicle or the physiologically relevant 10 nm E2 for 3 h followed by incubation with 2-[14C]DG. We confirmed that PFKFB3 protein expression was decreased by transfection with PFKFB3 siRNA relative to the control siRNA and found that the PFKFB3 siRNA completely blocked the E2-mediated up-regulation of PFKFB3 expression (Fig. 4, A and B). PFKFB3 has the highest kinase:bisphosphatase ratio of the PFKFB family, and we postulated that inhibition of PFKFB3 expression would suppress the intracellular F26BP concentration. We found that transfection with the PFKFB3 siRNA (which does not affect the other family members) markedly reduced the F26BP concentration in vehicle- and E2-stimulated MCF-7 cells after 3 h (Fig. 4C). To test the hypothesis that PFKFB3/F26BP is required for the stimulation of glucose uptake and glycolysis by E2, we examined the effect of PFKFB3 siRNA on the 2-[14C]DG uptake and 3H2O release (i.e. glycolysis) stimulated by E2. We found that transfection with the PFKFB3 siRNA reduced basal glucose uptake and glycolysis and completely blocked the stimulation of glucose uptake and glycolysis caused by E2 at 3 h (Fig. 4, D and E). Taken together, these data indicate that E2 rapidly stimulates glucose uptake in part by increasing PFKFB3 expression and F26BP. We next postulated that inhibition of the kinase activity of PFKFB3 by a clinical-grade PFKFB3 inhibitor, PFK158, would, like the PFKFB3 siRNA, attenuate the E2-mediated stimulation of F26BP and glucose uptake and glycolysis. Initially, we identified a concentration of PFK158 that does not affect viability after 3 h of exposure (3 μm; data not shown). We then examined the effect of PFK158 on PFKFB3 protein expression in the absence and presence of 10 nm E2 and observed relatively little effect on the E2-induced expression of PFKFB3 (Fig. 5, A and B). However, we did observe a marked decrease in the E2-stimulated F26BP (Fig. 5C), 2-[14C]DG uptake (Fig. 5D) and glycolysis (Fig. 5E). These data indicate that selective inhibition of the substrate-binding domain of PFKFB3 is sufficient to completely block the ability of E2 to stimulate glucose uptake. Of note, whereas transfection of unstimulated MCF-7 cells with the PFKFB3 siRNA significantly reduced glucose uptake and glycolysis (Fig. 4, D and E), exposure of unstimulated MCF-7 cells to PFK158 did not reduce glucose uptake or glycolysis (Fig. 5D, 5E). We believe that this disparity may be because of the relative potency of PFK158 which competitively but not completely inhibits PFKFB3 (unlike the PFKFB3 siRNA which essentially depletes all PFKFB3 protein). Given that both PFKFB3 siRNA and PFK158 can suppress the E2-stimulated increase in F26BP, glucose uptake, and glycolysis, we sought to determine whether PFKFB3 expression by itself would result in similar biochemical changes. We transiently expressed PFKFB3 in MCF-7 cells and found that forced expression of PFKFB3 mRNA (Fig. 6A) and protein (Fig. 6, C and D) can increase the steady-state concentration of F26BP (Fig. 6B), glucose uptake (Fig. 6E), and glycolysis (Fig. 6F) in MCF-7 cells. To determine the utility of combining anti-estrogens with PFKFB3 inhibitors, we next examined the effects of 100 nm ICI 182,780, a commonly prescribed pure anti-estrogen compound, a pro-apoptotic concentration of PFK158 (5 μm at 24 h), or combined 100 nm ICI 182,780 + 5 μm PFK158 on apoptosis using Annexin V/PI staining by flow cytometry. We observed that the addition of ICI 182,780 caused a synergistic increase in late apoptotic MCF-7 cells relative to that caused by PFK158 alone after 24 h of exposure (Fig. 7, A and B). These data suggest that the addition of PFK158 to anti-estrogen therapeutic agents may increase response rates and perhaps the durability of responses in preclinical and clinical studies. In this study, we describe PFKFB3 as an early molecular target of estradiol via direct binding of the ER to the PFKFB3 promoter. We also show that E2 up-regulates PFKFB3 expression in ER-responsive MCF-7 cells, increasing the steady-state concentration of F26BP, glucose uptake, and glycolysis. Although our study does not characterize all of the potential mechanisms by which E2 increases glucose metabolism, our results do demonstrate that PFKFB3 expression and activity are required to mediate E2-mediated glucose uptake and glycolysis. We postulate that the increase in F26BP by E2 leads to the stimulation of PFK-1 which, in turn, may cause a reduction in the PFK-1 substrate Fru-6-P, which is in equilibrium with Glc-6-P, an allosteric inhibitor of hexokinase, which itself is required for glucose uptake (19.Gregoriou M. Cornish-Bowden A. Trayer I.P. Isotope-exchange evidence for allosteric regulation of hexokinase II by glucose 6-phosphate and for an obligatory addition of substrates.Biochem. Soc.

Chem. 1982; 363: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Importantly, the ability of PFKFB3 to regulate glucose uptake has been demonstrated previously by work showing that genetic ablation of the pfkfb3 gene reduces F26BP and glucose uptake in transformed cells in vivo and in vitro (22.Telang S. Yalcin A. Clem A.L. Bucala R. Lane A.N. Eaton J.W. Chesney J. Ras transformation requires metabolic control by 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase.Oncogene. 2006; 25: 7225-7234Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The therapeutic implications of our observation that E2 requires PFKFB3 to stimulate glucose metabolism in vitro are 2-fold: (i) F26BP may be required for the metabolic flare induced by E2 in breast cancer patients; and (ii) combined inhibition of PFKFB3 and ER functions may be an effective therapeutic strategy for ER+ stage IV breast cancer patients. The activation of the ER by estrogens serves a critical role in cancer initiation and progression, and their antagonists have proven efficacy in the treatment of breast cancers. Anti-estrogen therapies include selective ER modulators such as Tamoxifen that act as partial receptor agonists, estrogen synthesis inhibitors such as aromatase inhibitors, and receptor expression inhibitors such as the anti-estrogen ICI 182,780. Each of these modalities is effective in 50–70% of breast cancer patients initially, but recurrent ER+ breast tumors respond to such anti-estrogen treatments in only ∼30% of patients, and durable responses are even rarer (23.Ingle J.N. Pharmacogenomics of endocrine therapy in breast cancer.J. Hum. Genet. 2013; 58: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Consequently, there is an important need to identify novel ER signaling targets, such as PFKFB3, to guide the development of therapeutic strategies to maximize endocrine responses. Our observation that E2 increases PFKFB3 expression and F26BP synthesis is the first report that ER signaling regulates PFKFB3 expression and activity. PFKFB3 is a key regulator of glucose metabolism and has proven to be an important target for antineoplastic therapy (24.Clem B.F. O'Neal J. Tapolsky G. Clem A.L. Imbert-Fernandez Y. Kerr 2nd, D.A. Klarer A.C. Redman R. Miller D.M. Trent J.O. Telang S. Chesney J. Targeting 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (PFKFB3) as a therapeutic strategy against cancer.Mol. Cancer Ther. 2013; 12: 1461-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Additionally, PFKFB3 ChIP experiments demonstrate interaction of the ERα at the half-site EREs located on the −2000 region of the PFKFB3 promoter. Based on these results, we envision the following series of events mediated by exposure of ER+ breast cancer cells to E2: (i) E2 increases PFKFB3 transcription by a mechanism involving ERα occupancy of the PFKFB3 promoter; (ii) the increase in PFKFB3 mRNA translates into an increase in protein and more importantly, an increase in the product, F26BP; and (iii) F26BP activates PFK-1, an essential control enzyme for the entire glycolytic pathway, which reduces Fru-6-P and Glc-6-P, resulting in less allosteric inhibition of hexokinase and increased glucose uptake (Fig. 8). In this study we have found that PFKFB3 and its product, F26BP, are induced by E2 and required for the E2-mediated stimulation of glucose uptake and glycolysis. We also have found that a PFKFB3 inhibitor undergoing phase I trial testing in solid tumor patients, PFK158, causes a synergistic increase in apoptosis by ER+ breast cancer cells when combined with the widely used anti-estrogen ICI 182,780. These observations support the conduct of Investigational New Drug-enabling preclinical toxicity and efficacy studies of combinations of PFK158 and ICI 182,780 to facilitate the eventual development of phase I/II trials in ER+ stage IV breast cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W1986718746,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Recently, we have shown that Notch1 inhibition resulted in substantial cell death of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells in vitro. New compounds targeting Notch signal transduction have been developed and are now being tested in clinical trials. However, the tumorigenic role of individual Notch receptors in vivo remains largely unclear. Using a KrasG12D-driven endogenous NSCLC mouse model, we analyzed the effect of conditional Notch1 and Notch2 receptor deletion on NSCLC tumorigenesis. Notch1 deficiency led to a reduced early tumor formation and lower activity of MAPK compared with the controls. Unexpectedly, Notch2 deletion resulted in a dramatically increased carcinogenesis and increased MAPK activity. These mice died significantly earlier due to rapidly growing tumor burden. We found that Notch1 regulates Ras/MAPK pathway via HES1-induced repression of the DUSP1 promoter encoding a phosphatase specifically suppressing pERK1/2. Interestingly, Notch1 but not Notch2 ablation leads to decreased HES1 and DUSP1 expression. However, Notch2-depleted tumors showed an appreciable increase in β-catenin expression, a known activator of HES1 and important lung cancer oncogene. Characteristically for β-catenin upregulation, we found that the majority of Notch2-deficient tumors revealed an undifferentiated phenotype as determined by their morphology, E-Cadherin and TTF1 expression levels. In addition, these carcinomas showed aggressive growth patterns with bronchus invasion and obstruction. Together, we show that Notch2 mediates differentiation and has tumor suppressor functions during lung carcinogenesis, whereas Notch1 promotes tumor initiation and progression. These data are further supported by immunohistochemical analysis of human NSCLC samples showing loss or downregulation of Notch2 compared with normal lung tissue. In conclusion, this is the first study characterizing the in vivo functions of Notch1 and Notch2 in KrasG12D-driven NSCLC tumorigenesis. These data highlight the clinical importance of a thorough understanding of Notch signaling especially with regard to Notch-targeted therapies."
https://openalex.org/W1992004872,"Physiologically, only a few primordial follicles are activated to enter the growing follicle pool each wave. Recent studies in knock-out mice show that early follicular activation depends on signaling from the tuberous sclerosis complex, the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. However, the manner in which these pathways are normally regulated, and whether or not TGF-β acts on them are poorly understood. So, this study aims to identify whether or not TGF-β acts on the process. Ovary organ culture experiments showed that the culture of 18.5 days post-coitus (dpc) ovaries with TGF-β1 reduced the total population of oocytes and activated follicles, accelerated oocyte growth was observed in ovaries treated with TGF-βR1 inhibitor 2-(5-chloro-2-fluorophenyl)pteridin-4-yl]pyridin-4-yl-amine (SD208) compared with control ovaries, the down-regulation of TGF-βR1 gene expression also activated early primordial follicle oocyte growth. We further showed that there was dramatically more proliferation of granulosa cells in SD208-treated ovaries and less proliferation in TGF-β1-treated ovaries. Western blot and morphological analyses indicated that TGF-β signaling manipulated primordial follicle growth through tuberous sclerosis complex/mTORC1 signaling in oocytes, and the mTORC1-specific inhibitor rapamycin could partially reverse the stimulated effect of SD208 on the oocyte growth and decreased the numbers of growing follicles. In conclusion, our results suggest that TGF-β signaling plays an important physiological role in the maintenance of the dormant pool of primordial follicles, which functions through activation of p70 S6 kinase 1 (S6K1)/ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) signaling in mouse ovaries. Physiologically, only a few primordial follicles are activated to enter the growing follicle pool each wave. Recent studies in knock-out mice show that early follicular activation depends on signaling from the tuberous sclerosis complex, the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. However, the manner in which these pathways are normally regulated, and whether or not TGF-β acts on them are poorly understood.

https://openalex.org/W2015260661,"Glutathione-dependent enzymes play important protective, repair, or metabolic roles in cells. In particular, enzymes in the glutathione S-transferase (GST) superfamily function in stress responses, defense systems, or xenobiotic detoxification. Here, we identify novel features of bacterial GSTs that cleave β-aryl ether bonds typically found in plant lignin. Our data reveal several original features of the reaction cycle of these GSTs, including stereospecific substrate recognition and stereoselective formation of β-S-thioether linkages. Products of recombinant GSTs (LigE, LigP, and LigF) are β-S-glutathionyl-α-keto-thioethers that are degraded by a β-S-thioetherase (LigG). All three Lig GSTs produced the ketone product (β-S-glutathionyl-α-veratrylethanone) from an achiral side chain-truncated model substrate (β-guaiacyl-α-veratrylethanone). However, when β-etherase assays were conducted with a racemic model substrate, β-guaiacyl-α-veratrylglycerone, LigE- or LigP-catalyzed reactions yielded only one of two potential product (β-S-glutathionyl-α-veratrylglycerone) epimers, whereas the other diastereomer (differing in configuration at the β-position (i.e. its β-epimer)) was produced only in the LigF-catalyzed reaction. Thus, β-etherase catalysis causes stereochemical inversion of the chiral center, converting a β(R)-substrate to a β(S)-product (LigE and LigP), and a β(S)-substrate to a β(R)-product (LigF). Further, LigG catalyzed glutathione-dependent β-S-thioether cleavage with β-S-glutathionyl-α-veratrylethanone and with β(R)-configured β-S-glutathionyl-α-veratrylglycerone but exhibited no or significantly reduced β-S-thioether-cleaving activity with the β(S)-epimer, demonstrating that LigG is a stereospecific β-thioetherase. We therefore propose that multiple Lig enzymes are needed in this β-aryl etherase pathway in order to cleave the racemic β-ether linkages that are present in the backbone of the lignin polymer."
https://openalex.org/W1999705209,"The hexa-coordinate heme in the H2S-generating human enzyme cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) acts as a redox-sensitive regulator that impairs CBS activity upon binding of NO(•) or CO at the reduced iron. Despite the proposed physiological relevance of this inhibitory mechanism, unlike CO, NO(•) was reported to bind at the CBS heme with very low affinity (Kd = 30-281 μm). This discrepancy was herein reconciled by investigating the NO(•) reactivity of recombinant human CBS by static and stopped-flow UV-visible absorption spectroscopy. We found that NO(•) binds tightly to the ferrous CBS heme, with an apparent Kd ≤ 0.23 μm. In line with this result, at 25 °C, NO(•) binds quickly to CBS (k on ∼ 8 × 10(3) m(-1) s(-1)) and dissociates slowly from the enzyme (k off ∼ 0.003 s(-1)). The observed rate constants for NO(•) binding were found to be linearly dependent on [NO(•)] up to ∼ 800 μm NO(•), and >100-fold higher than those measured for CO, indicating that the reaction is not limited by the slow dissociation of Cys-52 from the heme iron, as reported for CO. For the first time the heme of human CBS is reported to bind NO(•) quickly and tightly, providing a mechanistic basis for the in vivo regulation of the enzyme by NO(•). The novel findings reported here shed new light on CBS regulation by NO(•) and its possible (patho)physiological relevance, enforcing the growing evidence for an interplay among the gasotransmitters NO(•), CO, and H2S in cell signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2151293938,"To avoid genomic instability, cells have developed surveillance mechanisms such as the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) and the DNA damage response. ATM and MDC1 are central players of the cellular response to DNA double-strand breaks. Here, we identify a new role for these proteins in the regulation of mitotic progression and in SAC activation. MDC1 localizes at mitotic kinetochores following SAC activation in an ATM-dependent manner. ATM phosphorylates histone H2AX at mitotic kinetochores, and this phosphorylation is required for MDC1 localization at kinetochores. ATM and MDC1 are needed for kinetochore localization of the inhibitory mitotic checkpoint complex components, Mad2 and Cdc20, and for the maintenance of the mitotic checkpoint complex integrity. This probably relies on the interaction of MDC1 with the MCC. In this work, we have established that ATM and MDC1 maintain genomic stability not only by controlling the DNA damage response, but also by regulating SAC activation, providing an important link between these two essential biological processes."
https://openalex.org/W2008001776,"Mice and humans lacking caveolae due to gene knock-out or inactivating mutations of cavin-1/PTRF have numerous pathologies including markedly aberrant fuel metabolism, lipodystrophy, and muscular dystrophy. We characterized the physiologic/metabolic profile of cavin-1 knock-out mice and determined that they were lean because of reduced white adipose depots. The knock-out mice were resistant to diet-induced obesity and had abnormal lipid metabolism in the major metabolic organs of white and brown fat and liver. Epididymal white fat cells from cavin-1-null mice were small and insensitive to insulin and β-adrenergic agonists resulting in reduced adipocyte lipid storage and impaired lipid tolerance. At the molecular level, the lipolytic defects in white fat were caused by impaired perilipin phosphorylation, and the reduced triglyceride accumulation was caused by decreased fatty acid uptake and incorporation as well as the virtual absence of insulin-stimulated glucose transport. The livers of cavin-1-null mice were mildly steatotic and did not accumulate more lipid after high-fat feeding. The brown adipose tissues of cavin-1-null mice exhibited decreased mitochondria protein expression, which was restored upon high fat feeding. Taken together, these data suggest that dysfunction in fat, muscle, and liver metabolism in cavin-1-null mice causes a pleiotropic phenotype, one apparently identical to that of humans lacking caveolae in all tissues."

We now report that Cx37, another member of the connexin family of proteins, is expressed in osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and osteocytes. Mice with global deletion of Cx37 (Cx37−/−) exhibit higher bone mineral density, cancellous bone volume, and mechanical strength compared with wild type littermates. Osteoclast number and surface are significantly lower in bone of Cx37−/− mice. In contrast, osteoblast number and surface and bone formation rate in bones from Cx37−/− mice are unchanged. Moreover, markers of osteoblast activity ex vivo and in vivo are similar to those of Cx37+/+ littermates. sRANKL/M-CSF treatment of nonadherent Cx37−/− bone marrow cells rendered a 5-fold lower level of osteoclast differentiation compared with Cx37+/+ cell cultures. Further, Cx37−/− osteoclasts are smaller and have fewer nuclei per cell. Expression of RANK, TRAP, cathepsin K, calcitonin receptor, matrix metalloproteinase 9, NFATc1, DC-STAMP, ATP6v0d1, and CD44, markers of osteoclast number, fusion, or activity, is lower in Cx37−/− osteoclasts compared with controls. In addition, nonadherent bone marrow cells from Cx37−/− mice exhibit higher levels of markers for osteoclast precursors, suggesting altered osteoclast differentiation. The reduction of osteoclast differentiation is associated with activation of Notch signaling. We conclude that Cx37 is required for osteoclast differentiation and fusion, and its absence leads to arrested osteoclast maturation and high bone mass in mice.

Bellido T. Beyond gap junctions: Connexin43 and bone cell signaling.Bone. 2013; 52: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Six connexin proteins arrange in the cell membrane to form hemichannels or connexons. Connexins mediate intercellular communication through gap junction channels formed by two connexons that connect adjacent cells or as unopposed hemichannels, via the release of small molecules to the extracellular medium (2.Nielsen M.S. Nygaard Axelsen L. Sorgen P.L. Verma V. Delmar M. Holstein-Rathlou N.H. Gap junctions.Compr. Physiol. 2012; 2: 1981-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The C terminus of connexin proteins faces the cytoplasm and through interactions with kinases and structural molecules participate in the regulation of intracellular signaling independently of channel activity (3.Hervé J.C. Derangeon M. Sarrouilhe D. Giepmans B.N. Bourmeyster N. Gap junctional channels are parts of multiprotein complexes.Biochim. Biophys.

Most cells express multiple connexins that form hemichannels composed of one or two different connexins (4.Segretain D. Falk M.M. Regulation of connexin biosynthesis, assembly, gap junction formation, and removal.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1662: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Cx43, for example, can form hemichannels with Cx37, Cx40, or Cx46. In addition, hemichannels composed by one connexin protein in one cell can dock with hemichannels formed by another connexin in a neighboring cell to form heterotypic gap junction channels, which exhibit unique properties, different from channels composed by only one connexin (5.White T.W. Paul D.L. Goodenough D.A. Bruzzone R. Functional analysis of selective interactions among rodent connexins.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 459-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In bone, Cx43 is the main connexin expressed in osteoblasts, osteocytes, and osteoclasts, and it has been the focus of research on the role of this family of proteins in the skeleton (1.Plotkin L.I. Bellido T. Beyond gap junctions: Connexin43 and bone cell signaling.Bone. 2013; 52: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). A recent gene array study showed that Cx37 (GJA4) is also expressed in bone cells, and it is five times more abundant in osteocytes than in osteoblasts (6.Paic F. Igwe J.C. Nori R. Kronenberg M.S. Franceschetti T. Harrington P. Kuo L. Shin D.G. Rowe D.W. Harris S.E. Kalajzic I. Identification of differentially expressed genes between osteoblasts and osteocytes.Bone. 2009; 45: 682-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). However, Cx37 expression in osteoclasts and their precursors has not been examined. In addition, the relative expression level of Cx37 compared with Cx43 in bone and the role of Cx37 on bone cell function remain unknown. Cx37 is expressed in monocytes/macrophages, platelets, kidney, and ovaries, but it is more abundant in endothelial cells in the blood vessels (7.Söhl G. Willecke K. Gap junctions and the connexin protein family.Cardiovasc. Res. 2004; 62: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 8.Chanson M. Kwak B.R.

Connexins and the kidney.Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2010; 298: R1143-R1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, Cx37 deletion does not impair vascular function because Cx40, which is also expressed in endothelial cells, can compensate for the absence of Cx37 (10.Figueroa X.F. Duling B.R. Gap junctions in the control of vascular function.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2009; 11: 251-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 11.Simon A.M. McWhorter A.R. Vascular abnormalities in mice lacking the endothelial gap junction proteins connexin37 and connexin40.Dev. Biol. 2002; 251: 206-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Indeed, double knock-out mice lacking both Cx37 and Cx40 die at birth as result of vascular abnormalities. The main phenotypic characteristic of Cx37 null mice is female sterility caused by lack of terminal oocyte maturation, absence of ovulation, and accumulation of abnormal corpora lutea. In contrast, male homozygous Cx37−/− and heterozygous Cx37+/− mice breed normally. Variants of the Cx37 gene are associated with several human diseases. Thus, a Cx37 gene polymorphism resulting from replacement of serine 319 (319S in designations below) by proline (319P in designations below) in the regulatory cytoplasmic tail is a diagnostic marker for atherosclerosis in humans; with higher risk for myocardial infarction and reduced risk of coronary artery disease in patients carrying the Cx37–319S allele. The increased permeability exhibited by Cx37–319P hemichannels may mediate the differential effects of the two Cx37 polymorphic alleles. In addition, Cx37–319P, but not Cx37–319S, decreases proliferation when transfected into HeLa or SK-HEP-1 cells (12.Morel S. Burnier L. Roatti A. Chassot A. Roth I. Sutter E. Galan K. Pfenniger A. Chanson M. Kwak B.R. Unexpected role for the human Cx37 C1019T polymorphism in tumour cell proliferation.Carcinogenesis. 2010; 31: 1922-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The proline variant can be phosphorylated by GSK3β, an event that leads to reduced channel activity and decreased proliferation in HeLa cells. Interestingly, the same human gene polymorphism is associated with bone mass in a Japanese population, with men carrying the Cx37–319S allele exhibiting lower total body, lumbar spine, femoral neck, and trochanter bone mineral density (BMD) (13.Yamada Y. Ando F. Shimokata H. Association of candidate gene polymorphisms with bone mineral density in community-dwelling Japanese women and men.Int. J. Mol. Med. 2007; 19: 791-801PubMed Google Scholar). We examined in the current study the skeletal phenotype of mice with global deletion of Cx37. We found that Cx37 is expressed in osteoblasts, osteocytes, and osteoclasts, albeit at lower levels than Cx43. Nevertheless, lack of Cx37 impairs osteoclastogenesis, without affecting osteoblast differentiation or function. Our data indicate that reduced bone resorption in Cx37 null mice leads to increased bone mass and bone volume, in particular in cancellous bone of the vertebrae. Mice with global deletion of Cx37, generated by A. Simon (14.Simon A.M. Goodenough D.A. Li E. Paul D.L.

Burt (University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ), were maintained in a C57BL/6 background. Mice expressing green fluorescent protein under the control of the dentin matrix protein 1 promoter (DMP1-GFP) in a C57BL/6 background were previously described (15.Kalajzic I. Braut A. Guo D.

All mice were fed a regular diet and water ad libitum and maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle. All protocols involving mice were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Indiana University School of Medicine. Mice were genotyped by PCR using specific primer sets as follows: wild type allele was detected using 5′-TGC TAG ACC AGG TCC AGG AAC-3′ and 5′-GTC CCT TCG TGC CTT TAT CTC-3′, and the mutant allele was detected by 5′-GAT CTC TCG TGG GAT CAT TG-3′ and 5′-TGC TAG ACC AGG TCC AGG AAC-3′. An amplified fragment of 750 bp corresponds to the wild type allele and of 233 bp to the mutant allele. The mice received intraperitoneal injections of calcein (20 mg/kg; Sigma) and alizarin red (20 mg/kg; Sigma) 7 and 2 days before sacrifice, respectively, to allow for dynamic histomorphometric measurements (16.Rhee Y.

Bone marrow cells were isolated from Cx37+/+ and Cx37−/− by flushing the bone marrow out with α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 15% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin and then plated at a density of 4 × 105/cm in 24-well plates for 48 h. Nonadherent cells were collected and either plated for osteoclast formation or digested to obtain mRNA.

Adherent cells were collected after the initial 48 h in culture, plated at a density of 4 × 105/cm2, and cultured until reaching 95–100% of confluence. Then differentiation medium (α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid, and 10 mm β-glycerophosphate) was added. Medium was changed every third day.

Brun L.R. Murphy T.R. Farlow N.R. Robling A.G. Bellido T. Plotkin L.I. Absence of Cx43 selectively from osteocytes enhances responsiveness to mechanical force in mice.J. Orthop. Res. 2013; 31: 1075-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). qPCR was performed using the housekeeping gene GAPDH, and the ΔCt method. Primers and probes were designed using the Assay Design Center (Roche Applied Science) or were commercially available (Applied Biosystems). Vertebrae (L6 and L2 for 2.5- and 5-month-old mice, respectively) were dissected, fixed, and embedded in methyl methacrylate. Static historphometric analysis was performed on TRAP-stained sections, as previously described (20.Bivi N. Condon K.W. Allen M.R. Farlow N. Passeri G. Brun L.R. Rhee Y. Bellido T. Plotkin L.I.

Dynamic histomorphometric analysis of bone sections was performed on unstained sections, avoiding the primary spongiosa. All measurements were obtained using OsteoMeasure high resolution digital video system (OsteoMetrics Inc., Decatur, GA). The terminology and units used are those recommended by the Histomorphometry Nomenclature Committee of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (27.Dempster D.W. Compston J.E. Drezner M.K. Glorieux F.H. Kanis J.A. Malluche H. Meunier P.J. Ott S.M. Recker R.R. Parfitt A.M.

Res. 2013; 28: 2-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (1757) Google Scholar). Femora and lumbar (L5) vertebrae obtained from 5-month-old mice were tested via three-point bending and compression, respectively, following previously published protocols with modifications (28.Plotkin L.I. Bivi N. Bellido T. A bisphosphonate that does not affect osteoclasts prevents osteoblast and osteocyte apoptosis and the loss of bone strength induced by glucocorticoids in mice.Bone. 2011; 49: 122-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Briefly, bones were thawed to room temperature, hydrated in 0.9% saline, and loaded to failure at 2 mm/min with force versus displacement data collected at 10 Hz using a servo-hydraulic test system (Test Resources). Femora were loaded to failure in an anterior-posterior direction with the upper contact area at the mid-diaphysis (50% total bone length), and the bottom contact points centered around this point and separated by 8 mm. The posterior processes and end plates were removed prior to testing of the vertebra. Structural mechanical properties, ultimate load, stiffness, and energy to failure were determined from the load deformation curves using standard definitions, whereas material level estimations of ultimate stress, modulus, and toughness were calculated using standard equations. Cross-sectional moment of inertia and anterior-posterior diameter were determined by μCT and were used to calculate material level properties, as previously described (29.Allen M.R. Reinwald S. Burr D.B. Alendronate reduces bone toughness of ribs without significantly increasing microdamage accumulation in dogs following 3 years of daily treatment.Calcif. Tissue Int. 2008; 82: 354-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Plasma C-telopeptide fragments (RatLaps; Immunodiagnostic Systems Inc., Fountain Hill, AZ), osteocalcin (Biomedical Technologies, Soughton, MA), and sclerostin levels (ALPCO Immunoassays, Salem, NH) were measured as described by the manufacturer. Alkaline phosphatase activity was assessed by a standard automated method using a Randox Daytona chemical analyzer. Ovaries were fixed in 3.7% PBS-buffered formaldehyde at room temperature for 48 h, followed by transfer to 70% ethanol. Specimens were subsequently dehydrated in ascending ethanol concentrations and embedded in paraffin. 5-μm-thick sections were processed for hematoxilin and eosin staining. Images were acquired using an Olympus BX51 TRF microscope equipped with a digital camera. The data were analyzed by using SigmaPlot (Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA). Differences were evaluated by Student's t test and considered significant for p < 0.05. All values are reported as the means ± S.D. Gene expression analysis shows that Cx37 is expressed in whole bone at approximately four times lower levels than Cx43 (Fig. 1a). Cx37 can also be detected at much lower levels than Cx43 in the OB-6 osteoblastic cells, in immortalized osteoblastic calvaria cells, and in MLO-Y4 osteocytic cells. In primary osteoblasts, the expression of Cx37 is ∼300 times lower than that of Cx43, whereas in primary osteocytes it is ∼60 times lower (Fig. 1b). In addition, Cx37 is detected in osteoclasts generated by treatment of nonadherent bone marrow cells with M-CSF and sRANKL. In these osteoclast cultures, the expression of Cx37 is also lower than Cx43 (∼120-fold). Cx37-deficient mice did not exhibit gross abnormalities at birth and qualitatively appear to have a distribution of cartilage and mineralized bone similar to that of wild type littermates (Fig. 2a). Body weight was similar in male mice from either genotype from 2 to 5 months (Fig. 2b). Femoral length was not different between phenotypes at 5 months of age (15.19 ± 0.27 versus 15.44 ± 0.18 mm for wild type Cx37+/+ and Cx37−/− mice, respectively). Female mice exhibit a slight increase in weight at 1 (not shown), 2, and 5 months of age (Fig. 2b). Male Cx37−/− mice exhibit higher total (5–9%), spinal (11–21%), and femoral (8–21%) BMD compared with wild type littermates at each age examined (Fig. 2c). Female Cx37-deficient mice also exhibit higher bone mass, albeit less than males, with a 3–4% increase in total BMD and a 5–7% increase in femoral BMD at 4 and 5 month of age. μCT analysis showed higher bone volume and trabecular number in the cancellous bone of the lumbar vertebra at 2.5 and 5 months of age (Fig. 3a). This was associated with increased trabecular thickness and a tendency toward higher trabecular number in the young animals. In the older mice, only trabecular number was higher. Similar effects of Cx37 deletion were observed in the cancellous bone in the distal femur at 2.5 months of age (Fig. 3b). However, there were no differences between genotypes in 5-month-old mice. Deletion of Cx37 does not result in major changes in cortical architecture or bone material density in the femoral midshaft compared with wild type littermates, with only a slight but significant reduction in cortical thickness (Fig. 3c). Lumbar vertebrae from Cx37 null mice exhibited higher energy to ultimate load, an indication of the capacity of the bone to resist compression forces (Fig. 4a). Ultimate force and stiffness showed a tendency toward higher values in mice lacking Cx37, but the difference did not reach significance. Deletion of Cx37 resulted in higher cortical bone strength as evidenced by increased ultimate force and mechanical stiffness, compared with wild type littermates in the cortical bone of the femoral midshaft (Fig. 4b). Estimations of material properties, on the other hand, showed no difference between genotypes. Static histomorphometry revealed a lower number of osteoclasts per bone surface and reduced bone surface covered by osteoclasts and eroded surface/BS on the vertebral cancellous surface of Cx37−/− mice compared with controls at 2.5 and 5 months of age (Fig. 5, a and b). The number of osteoblasts/BS and the bone surface covered by osteoblasts, on the other hand, was not different between genotypes at either age. The lower osteoclast parameters combined with the lack of change on osteoblasts resulted in an increase in quiescent bone surface in Cx37−/− mice. Dynamic histomorphometry showed no differences in mineralizing surface/BS, mineral apposition rate, and bone formation rate/BS, parameters that reflect osteoblast number and activity in 5-month-old mice (Fig. 5c). Differences in circulating markers of bone resorption (C-telopeptide fragments) or formation (osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase) or in sclerostin, the inhibitor of Wnt signaling, were not detected in either male or female mice at 2, 3, or 5 months of age (Fig. 6).FIGURE 6Circulating markers of bone formation and resorption are not altered in mice expressing or lacking Cx37. Circulating levels for C-telopeptide fragments (CTX), alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, and sclerostin were measured in serum of Cx37+/+ and Cx37−/− mice at the indicated ages.

https://openalex.org/W2144318738,"Development in foraging behaviour and dietary intake of many vertebrates are age-structured. Differences in feeding ecology may correlate with ontogenetic shifts in dispersal patterns, and therefore affect foraging habitat and resource utilization. Such life-history traits have important implications in interpreting tropho-dynamic linkages. Stable isotope ratios in the whiskers of sub-yearling southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina; n = 12) were used, in conjunction with satellite telemetry and environmental data, to examine their foraging habitat and diet during their first foraging migration. The trophic position of seals from Macquarie Island (54°30'S, 158°57'E) was estimated using stable carbon (δ(1) (3)C) and nitrogen (δ(15)N) ratios along the length of the whisker, which provided a temporal record of prey intake. Satellite-relayed data loggers provided details on seal movement patterns, which were related to isotopic concentrations along the whisker. Animals fed in waters south of the Polar Front (>60°S) or within Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) Statistical Subareas 88.1 and 88.2, as indicated by both their depleted δ(1) (3)C (<-20‰) values, and tracking data. They predominantly exploited varying proportions of mesopelagic fish and squid, and crustaceans, such as euphausiids, which have not been reported as a prey item for this species. Comparison of isotopic data between sub-yearlings, and 1, 2 and 3 yr olds indicated that sub-yearlings, limited by their size, dive capabilities and prey capture skills to feeding higher in the water column, fed at a lower trophic level than older seals. This is consistent with the consumption of euphausiids and most probably, Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), which constitute an abundant, easily accessible source of prey in water masses used by this age class of seals. Isotopic assessment and concurrent tracking of seals are successfully used here to identify ontogenetic shifts in broad-scale foraging habitat use and diet preferences in a highly migratory predator."
https://openalex.org/W2003135630,"Adult-derived human liver stem/progenitor cells (ADHLSC) are obtained after primary culture of the liver parenchymal fraction. The cells are of fibroblastic morphology and exhibit a hepato-mesenchymal phenotype. Hepatic stellate cells (HSC) derived from the liver non-parenchymal fraction, present a comparable morphology as ADHLSC. Because both ADHLSC and HSC are described as liver stem/progenitor cells, we strived to extensively compare both cell populations at different levels and to propose tools demonstrating their singularity. ADHLSC and HSC were isolated from the liver of four different donors, expanded in vitro and followed from passage 5 until passage 11. Cell characterization was performed using immunocytochemistry, western blotting, flow cytometry, and gene microarray analyses. The secretion profile of the cells was evaluated using Elisa and multiplex Luminex assays. Both cell types expressed α-smooth muscle actin, vimentin, fibronectin, CD73 and CD90 in accordance with their mesenchymal origin. Microarray analysis revealed significant differences in gene expression profiles. HSC present high expression levels of neuronal markers as well as cytokeratins. Such differences were confirmed using immunocytochemistry and western blotting assays. Furthermore, both cell types displayed distinct secretion profiles as ADHLSC highly secreted cytokines of therapeutic and immuno-modulatory importance, like HGF, interferon-γ and IL-10. Our study demonstrates that ADHLSC and HSC are distinct liver fibroblastic cell populations exhibiting significant different expression and secretion profiles."

This P-TEFb equilibrium determines the state of growth and proliferation of the cell. In this study, the release of P-TEFb from the 7SK snRNP led to increased synthesis of HEXIM1 but not HEXIM2 in HeLa cells, and this occurred only from an unannotated, proximal promoter. ChIP with sequencing revealed P-TEFb-sensitive poised RNA polymerase II at this proximal but not the previously annotated distal HEXIM1 promoter.

Even though the pathobiology of the resulting retinal degeneration has been characterized in several animal models, its complex molecular mechanism is not well understood. Here, we expressed P23H bovine rod opsin in the nervous system of Caenorhabditis elegans. Expression was low due to enhanced protein degradation. The mutant opsin was glycosylated, but the polysaccharide size differed from that of the normal protein. Although P23H opsin aggregated in the nervous system of C. elegans, the pharmacological chaperone 9-cis-retinal stabilized it during biogenesis, producing a variant of rhodopsin called P23H isorhodopsin. In vitro, P23H isorhodopsin folded correctly, formed the appropriate disulfide bond, could be photoactivated but with reduced sensitivity, and underwent Meta II decay at a rate similar to wild type isorhodopsin. In worm neurons, P23H isorhodopsin initiated phototransduction by coupling with the endogenous Gi/o signaling cascade that induced loss of locomotion. Using pharmacological interventions affecting protein synthesis and degradation, we showed that the chromophore could be incorporated either during or after mutant protein translation. However, regeneration of P23H isorhodopsin with chromophore was significantly slower than that of wild type isorhodopsin. This effect, combined with the inherent instability of P23H rhodopsin, could lead to the structural cellular changes and photoreceptor death found in autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa.

The disease is characterized by night blindness and progressive loss of peripheral vision due to rod photoreceptor cell death. Secondary cone photoreceptor cell death then causes legal blindness at later stages of RP. According to its inheritance type, RP is classified as autosomal dominant (ad), autosomal recessive (ar), and X-linked. Among more than 44 RP causal genes, mutations in the RHO gene encoding rhodopsin, the rod-specific G protein-coupled receptor, account for 25% of adRP cases (5.Daiger S.P. Bowne S.J. Sullivan L.S.

Gene delivery of the chaperone proteins preserved retinal structure and function in P23H TG rats (21.Gorbatyuk M.S. Knox T. LaVail M.M. Gorbatyuk O.S. Noorwez S.M. Hauswirth W.W. Lin J.H. Muzyczka N.

Interestingly, a single low dose of the heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitor HSP990 enhanced visual function and delayed photoreceptor degeneration in P23H TG rats, most likely by promoting degradation of the mutant protein (23.Aguila M. Bevilacqua D. McCulley C. Schwarz N. Athanasiou D. Kanuga N. Novoselov S.S. Lange C.A. Ali R.R. Bainbridge J.W. Gias C. Coffey P.J. Garriga P. Cheetham M.E. Hsp90 inhibition protects against inherited retinal degeneration.Hum Mol. Genet. 2013; 10.1093/hmg/ddt613PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, a P23H knock-in mouse model was developed to more faithfully recapitulate the genotype and phenotype of adRP patients. No significant inner segment opsin accumulation was observed in these mice, and the P23H opsin was rapidly degraded (24.Sakami S. Maeda T. Bereta G. Okano K. Golczak M. Sumaroka A. Roman A.J.

One unknown aspect is whether P23H opsin-induced UPR is the major factor triggering photoreceptor death, because P23H rhodopsin can be expressed in cell culture without cellular destabilization (8.Noorwez S.M. Kuksa V. Imanishi Y. Zhu L. Filipek S. Palczewski K. Kaushal S.

Also, homozygous P23H knock-in mice form discs at the ciliary protrusion of photoreceptors, suggesting that P23H rhodopsin can escape ER quality control and reach the rod outer segments (ROS) (25.Sakami S. Kolesnikov A.V. Kefalov V.J. Palczewski K. P23H opsin knock-in mice reveal a novel step in retinal rod disc morphogenesis.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2014; 23: 1723-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Even though heterozygous P23H knock-in mice had less than 10% P23H rhodopsin, they still exhibited aberrant internal membrane structures in their ROS (25.Sakami S. Kolesnikov A.V. Kefalov V.J. Palczewski K. P23H opsin knock-in mice reveal a novel step in retinal rod disc morphogenesis.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2014; 23: 1723-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This suggests that P23H rhodopsin residing in ROS could be toxic to photoreceptors. In homozygous young P23H knock-in mice with cone-signaling genetically ablated, electroretinogram recordings clearly demonstrated that P23H rhodopsin could initiate phototransduction (25.Sakami S. Kolesnikov A.V. Kefalov V.J. Palczewski K. P23H opsin knock-in mice reveal a novel step in retinal rod disc morphogenesis.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2014; 23: 1723-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Because of the instability of P23H opsin in existing expression systems, isolation of P23H rhodopsin was difficult (8.Noorwez S.M. Kuksa V. Imanishi Y. Zhu L. Filipek S. Palczewski K. Kaushal S. Pharmacological chaperone-mediated in vivo folding and stabilization of the P23H-opsin mutant associated with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa.J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 16278-16284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Therefore, knowledge of P23H rhodopsin's biochemical properties is limited. Is P23H rhodopsin folded or misfolded? Is it correctly disulfide bonded? Is the mutant pigment protein functional, i.e. can it regenerate efficiently and initiate phototransduction? How does it differ from WT rhodopsin? In this study, we investigated these questions by in vitro and in vivo assays of P23H bovine isorhodopsin generated by Caenorhabditis elegans. C. elegans is a transparent free-living nematode with a life span of 2–3 weeks (26.Edgar R.S. Wood W.B. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans: a new organism for intensive biological study.Science. 1977; 198: 1285-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The adult worm contains 302 neurons that form a simple nervous system (27.White J.G. Southgate E. Thomson J.N. Brenner S.

Isorhodopsin can be purified from large cultures of TG worms for biochemical characterization. C. elegans lack vision and do not express any endogenous visual pigments. However, TG expression of bovine opsin produced a 9-cis-retinal-dependent coupling of light exposure to the loss of locomotion in worms due to activation of the endogenous Gi/o signaling cascade by photoactivated isorhodopsin (28.Salom D.

Here, we sought to further characterize the P23H mutant opsin to obtain molecular insights into the mechanism of photoreceptor degeneration driven by this adRP mutation. P23H bovine opsin was expressed in the nervous system of C. elegans, and its localization and molecular properties were characterized. Our observations suggest a novel molecular mechanism for P23H rhodopsin-induced photoreceptor death in adRP. The Bristol N2 strain of C. elegans used for this study was maintained on nematode growth medium (NGM) (0.25% peptone, 51 mm NaCl, 25 mm K3PO4, 5 μg/ml cholesterol, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2) plates seeded with OP50 at room temperature. Loss-of-function mutants of Gi/o and Gq, goa-1(sa734) and egl-30(md186), respectively, were obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (University of Minnesota, Minneapolis). Primers used to identify homozygous mutants and mutated segments were goa-1(sa734), GCTGCACCACATACAGTGAGTGA (forward) and ACGAAATATTCGGACG TTCTATGG (reverse) with an early stop mutation in codon 52. Standard methods were employed for C. elegans cryostorage and recovery (31.Stiernagle T. Maintenance of C. elegans.WormBook. 2006; : 1-11PubMed Google Scholar). For the pan-neuronal bovine opsin ((b)opsin) expression construct (Genscript, Piscataway, NJ), codon-optimized (32.Stenico M. Lloyd A.T. Sharp P.M.

The pan-neuronal bovine opsin P23H expression construct itself was generated from WT (b)opsin vector by site-directed mutagenesis. TG worm lines were created by injecting WT or P23H opsin constructs (10 ng/μl) and DNA encoding the coral-derived red fluorescent protein (DsRed) (3 ng/μl) under control of the same promoter (PH20). Worms transiently expressing WT opsin or P23H (b)opsin were selected based on DsRed fluorescence. To integrate opsin cDNA into the worm genome, TG worm lines were exposed to 350 × 100 1 μJ/cm2 ultraviolet light (Spectrolinker XL-1500; Spectronics Corp., Westbury, NY), and F3 progeny of integrated TG lines were screened. TG worm lines with the highest expression of WT or P23H (b)opsin were then selected for further experiments. C. elegans samples were prepared according to a published protocol (34.Salom D. Wu N. Sun W. Dong Z. Palczewski K. Jordan S. Salon J.A. Heterologous expression and purification of the serotonin type 4 receptor from transgenic mouse retina.Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 13296-13307Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted with TRI Reagent (from MRC). One μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed with M-MLV reverse transcriptase (AB Applied Sciences). Real time-PCR was performed with TaqDNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science). Quantitative RT-PCR was carried out with SYBR® Master Mix (Invitrogen). Specificities of the quantitative PCR analyses were verified by denaturing curve analyses. Expression levels of particular gene transcripts were calculated based on a standard curve normalized to β-tubulin (tbb-1) levels. Primers used were as follows: P23H rhodopsin, CAATGCTCTAGAATGAACGGAACCGAGG (forward) and CGAAGACCATGAAGAGGTAGG (reverse); tbb-1, TGGTTCCATTCCCACGTC (forward) and TCGTCAACCTCTCTCATGGA (reverse). C. elegans samples were prepared as described previously (34.Salom D. Wu N. Sun W. Dong Z. Palczewski K. Jordan S. Salon J.A.

Briefly, worms were homogenized by sonication and centrifuged to remove debris. Supernatants were centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 15 min, and pellets were mixed in electrophoresis loading buffer, vortexed, and centrifuged briefly, and samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE in 10% Tris/glycine polyacrylamide gels. Immunoblotting was then done with 1D4 mouse monoclonal antibody recognizing the C-terminal peptide of bovine opsin followed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody. Quantification of immunoblot signals was accomplished with National Instruments Vision Assistant 8.5 software. Band intensities were measured and compared among samples loaded on the same gel. Age-synchronized larva stage 4 (L4) or day 1 animals from TG worm lines were sandwiched between two cover glasses, buried in dry ice for 30 min, and then fixed with 100% methanol (10 min), followed by 100% acetone (10 min). These worms were washed with PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, and 1.76 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4) for 0.5 h and incubated overnight at 4 °C with PBS containing Alexa-488-conjugated anti-rhodopsin 1D4 antibody and 0.1% Triton X-100. Stained worms were washed three times with PBS before their examination by confocal microscopy. All imaging was done with a Leica TCS SP2 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Bannockburn, IL). Either live worms immobilized with 10 mm NaN3 on 2% agarose pads or methanol/acetone-fixed worms were used. Stains employed were DsRed (λex = 543/λem = 580–630 nm) and Alexa-488 (λex = 488/λem = 510–530 nm). Age-synchronized L4 animals from TG worm lines were cultured in the dark on foil-covered NGM plates for 13 days with or without 10 μm 9-cis-retinal or DMSO. Because this stain was integrated together with WT or P23H opsin constructs, DsRed was constitutively expressed in the nervous system of TG worms. On day 13, DsRed images were obtained through an upright confocal microscope to analyze the nervous system structure. TG worm lines expressing the highest amounts of P23H or WT opsin were selected and cultured for purification of isorhodopsin. This procedure was modified from that previously reported for WT isorhodopsin (28.Salom D. Cao P. Sun W. Kramp K. Jastrzebska B. Jin H. Feng Z. Palczewski K. Heterologous expression of functional G-protein-coupled receptors in Caenorhabditis elegans.FASEB J. 2012; 26: 492-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Briefly, TG worms were cultured for two generations (5–6 days) in 10 150-mm high growth medium (HGM) culture dishes seeded with HB101 Escherichia coli bacteria and then transferred into a 10-liter fermenter filled with autoclaved S medium (31.Stiernagle T. Maintenance of C. elegans.WormBook. 2006; : 1-11PubMed Google Scholar). Worms then were cultured for two generations at room temperature, pH 7.0, with 50% dissolved oxygen and 300 rpm agitation, until their density reached ∼10 adult worms/μl. For P23H opsin worms, 50 mg of 9-cis-retinal was added to the culture 24 h before harvest, and the entire culture was incubated in the dark for biosynthesis of P23H isorhodopsin. Worm cultures were collected and centrifuged at 382 × g (JA-10; Beckman Instruments, Brea, CA) for 10 min, and the pellet was suspended in minimum S medium. Thirty-ml aliquots of worm suspension were then carefully loaded onto 300 ml of ice-cold 35% sucrose solution and centrifuged at 170 × g (JA-10; Beckman Instruments) for 5 min. The top layer containing live worms was collected, diluted with 1 liter of H2O and centrifuged at 382 × g for 10 min. The worm pellet was washed again with H2O and suspended in 50 mm Bis-tris propane (BTP) buffer, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl with protease inhibitor mixture (Complete Mini, EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science) prior to lysis. When worms were collected for disulfide bond analysis of isorhodopsin, 100 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM, Sigma) was added to the lysis and the wash and elution buffers to modify the free Cys residues. The worm suspension then was lysed with a microfluidizer (M-110Y Microfluidizer Processor, Microfluidic, Newton, MA) at 120 p.s.i. four times, and the debris was pelleted by a 300 × g centrifugation for 10 min. The resulting worm lysate was incubated with 0.7 mg of 9-cis-retinal (greater than a 100:1 chromophore/opsin ratio) to obtain either ground state WT isorhodopsin or stabilize P23H isorhodopsin. Then 100 units of bee venom phospholipase A2 (Sigma) with 1 mm CaCl2 was stirred in at 4 °C for 30 min. After membrane proteins were solubilized with 20 mm n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DDM) under gentle rotation for 1 h at 4 °C, solubilized"
https://openalex.org/W2048521886,"Epithelial cells lining the gastrointestinal tract and kidney have different abilities to facilitate paracellular and transcellular transport of water and solutes. In the kidney, the proximal tubule allows both transcellular and paracellular transport, while the collecting duct primarily facilitates transcellular transport. The claudins and E-cadherin are major structural and functional components regulating paracellular transport. In this study we present the novel finding that the transmembrane matrix receptors, integrins, play a role in regulating paracellular transport of renal proximal tubule cells. Deleting the integrin β1 subunit in these cells converts them from a ""loose"" epithelium, characterized by low expression of E-cadherin and claudin-7 and high expression of claudin-2, to a ""tight"" epithelium with increased E-cadherin and claudin-7 expression and decreased claudin-2 expression. This effect is mediated by the integrin β1 cytoplasmic tail and does not entail β1 heterodimerization with an α-subunit or its localization to the cell surface. In addition, we demonstrate that deleting the β1 subunit in the proximal tubule of the kidney results in a major urine-concentrating defect. Thus, the integrin β1 tail plays a key role in regulating the composition and function of tight and adherens junctions that define paracellular transport properties of terminally differentiated renal proximal tubule epithelial cells."

We identified four serine or threonine residues in the C-terminal domain of Runx2 that are responsible for Pin1 binding and structural modification. Confocal imaging studies indicated that FGF2 treatment strongly stimulated the focal accumulation of Pin1 in the subnuclear area, which recruited Runx2. In addition, active forms of RNA polymerase-II also colocalized in the same subnuclear compartment. Dipentamethylene thiuram monosulfide, a Pin1 inhibitor, strongly attenuated their focal accumulation as well as Runx2 transactivation activity. The Pin1-mediated structural modification of Runx2 is an indispensable step connecting phosphorylation and acetylation and, consequently, transcriptional activation of Runx2 by FGF signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2127157806,"After Helicobacter pylori infection in humans, gastric epithelial cells (GECs) undergo apoptosis due to stimulation by the bacteria or inflammatory cytokines. In this study, we assessed the expression and function of brain angiogenesis inhibitor 1 (BAI1) in the engulfment of apoptotic GECs using human tissue and cells. After induction of apoptosis by H. pylori or camptothecin, there was a 5-fold increase in the binding of apoptotic GECs to THP-1 cells or peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages as assayed by confocal microscopy or conventional and imaging flow cytometry. Binding was impaired 95% by pretreating apoptotic cells with annexin V, underscoring the requirement for phosphatidylserine recognition. The phosphatidylserine receptor BAI1 was expressed in human gastric biopsy specimens and gastric phagocytes. To confirm the role of BAI1 in apoptotic cell clearance, the functional domain of BAI1 was used as a competitive inhibitor or BAI1 expression was inhibited by small interfering RNA. Both approaches decreased binding and engulfment >40%. Exposing THP-1 cells to apoptotic cells inhibited IL-6 production from 1340 to <364 pg/ml; however, this decrease was independent of phagocytosis. We conclude that recognition of apoptotic cells by BAI1 contributes to their clearance in the human gastric mucosa and this is associated with anti-inflammatory effects.—Das, S., Sarkar, A., Ryan, K.

https://openalex.org/W2136892175,"The focal swellings of dendrites (“dendritic beading”) are an early morphological hallmark of neuronal injury and dendrotoxicity. They are associated with a variety of pathological conditions, including brain ischemia, and cause an acute disruption of synaptic transmission and neuronal network function, which contribute to subsequent neuronal death. Here, we show that increased synaptic activity prior to excitotoxic injury protects, in a transcription-dependent manner, against dendritic beading. Expression of activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), a nuclear calcium-regulated gene and member of the core gene program for acquired neuroprotection, can protect against dendritic beading. Conversely, knockdown of ATF3 exacerbates dendritic beading. Assessment of neuronal network functions using microelectrode array recordings revealed that hippocampal neurons expressing ATF3 were able to regain their ability for functional synaptic transmission and to participate in coherent neuronal network activity within 48 h after exposure to toxic concentrations of NMDA. Thus, in addition to attenuating cell death, synaptic activity and expression of ATF3 render hippocampal neurons more resistant to acute dendrotoxicity and loss of synapses.

https://openalex.org/W1974721873,"Recently, ETS-related gene (ERG) gene rearrangements, phosphatase tensin homologue (PTEN) deletions and EGFR family aberrations were characterized as potential biomarkers for prostate cancer (PCa) patient management. Although ERG gene rearrangement has been identified in approximately 50% of localized prostate cancers in western countries, the prognostic significance of this critical molecular event remains unknown in Chinese patients. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry, we evaluated ERG, PTEN and EGFR family aberrations in a cohort of 224 Chinese prostate cancer patients diagnosed in transurethral resection of the prostate (TUR-P). Overall, ERG rearrangement was detected in 23.2% (44/190) cases, of which 54.5% (24/44) showed deletion of the 5′end of ERG. PTEN deletion was identified in 10.8% (19/176) cases. Amplification of EGFR and HER2 genes was present in 1.1% (2/178) and 5.8% (10/173) of cases, respectively. Significant correlation between ERG rearrangement and PTEN deletion was identified in this cohort. EGFR and HER2 aberrations occurred more frequently in PCas without ERG rearrangement than in those with ERG rearrangement, although this did not reach statistical significance. Overall, ERG rearrangement was associated with pre-operative PSA values (P = 0.038) and cancer-related death (P = 0.02), but not with the age, clinical T stage, Gleason score, or Ki-67 labeling index (LI). Notably, multivariate analysis including known prognostic markers revealed ERG rearrangement was an independent prognostic factor (P = 0.022). Additionally, ERG rearrangement status was helpful to identify patients with poor prognosis from PCa group with low Ki-67 LI. In summary, we reported that ERG rearrangement was associated with cancer-related death in Chinese PCa patients. Determination of ERG rearrangement status allows stratification of PCa patients into different survival categories."

It is known that the bioactive compounds present in green tea increase osteogenic activity and decrease the risk of fracture by improving bone mineral density. However, the detailed mechanism underlying these beneficial effects has yet to be elucidated. In this study, we investigated the osteogenic effect of (−)-epicatechin gallate (ECG), a major bioactive compound found in green tea. We found that ECG effectively stimulates osteoblast differentiation, indicated by the increased expression of osteoblastic marker genes. Up-regulation of osteoblast marker genes is mediated by increased expression and interaction of the transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) and Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2). ECG facilitates nuclear localization of TAZ through PP1A. PP1A is essential for osteoblast differentiation because inhibition of PP1A activity was shown to suppress ECG-mediated osteogenic differentiation. Taken together, the results showed that ECG stimulates osteoblast differentiation through the activation of TAZ and RUNX2, revealing a novel mechanism for green tea-stimulated osteoblast differentiation.

We found that ECG effectively stimulates osteoblast differentiation, indicated by the increased expression of osteoblastic marker genes. Up-regulation of osteoblast marker genes is mediated by increased expression and interaction of the transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) and Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2). ECG facilitates nuclear localization of TAZ through PP1A. PP1A is essential for osteoblast differentiation because inhibition of PP1A activity was shown to suppress ECG-mediated osteogenic differentiation. Taken together, the results showed that ECG stimulates osteoblast differentiation through the activation of TAZ and RUNX2, revealing a novel mechanism for green tea-stimulated osteoblast differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2050825930,"Mutations in the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) tumor suppressor gene are common in cancer and can cause resistance to therapy. Using transcriptome analysis we identified MAF as an NF1- regulated transcription factor and verified MAF regulation through RAS/MAPK/AP-1 signaling in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) cell lines. MAF was also downregulated in human MPNST. Acute re-expression of MAF promoted expression of glial differentiation markers in MPNST cells in vitro, decreased self-renewal of embryonic precursors and transiently affected tumor cell phenotypes in vitro by increasing MPNST cell death and reducing metabolic activity and anchorage-independent growth. Paradoxically, chronic MAF overexpression enhanced MPNST cell tumor growth in vivo, correlating with elevated pS6 in vitro and in vivo. RAD001 blocked MAF-mediated tumor growth, and MAF regulated the mTOR pathway through DEPTOR. MAPK inhibition with NF1 loss of function is predicted to show limited efficacy due to reactivation of mTOR signaling via MAF."
https://openalex.org/W1985761719,"Discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) belongs to a unique family of receptor tyrosine kinases that signal in response to collagens. DDR1 undergoes autophosphorylation in response to collagen binding with a slow and sustained kinetics that is unique among members of the receptor tyrosine kinase family. DDR1 dimerization precedes receptor activation suggesting a structural inhibitory mechanism to prevent unwarranted phosphorylation. However, the mechanism(s) that maintains the autoinhibitory state of the DDR1 dimers is unknown. Here, we report that N-glycosylation at the Asn(211) residue plays a unique role in the control of DDR1 dimerization and autophosphorylation. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we found that mutations that disrupt the conserved (211)NDS N-glycosylation motif, but not other N-glycosylation sites (Asn(260), Asn(371), and Asn(394)), result in collagen I-independent constitutive phosphorylation. Mass spectrometry revealed that the N211Q mutant undergoes phosphorylation at Tyr(484), Tyr(520), Tyr(792), and Tyr(797). The N211Q traffics to the cell surface, and its ectodomain displays collagen I binding with an affinity similar to that of the wild-type DDR1 ectodomain. However, unlike the wild-type receptor, the N211Q mutant exhibits enhanced receptor dimerization and sustained activation upon ligand withdrawal. Taken together, these data suggest that N-glycosylation at the highly conserved (211)NDS motif evolved to act as a negative repressor of DDR1 phosphorylation in the absence of ligand. The presence of glycan moieties at that site may help to lock the collagen-binding domain in the inactive state and prevent unwarranted signaling by receptor dimers. These studies provide a novel insight into the structural mechanisms that regulate DDR activation."

Here we show that the predominant form of RyR in skeletal muscle, RyR1, is subject to Cys-directed modification by S-palmitoylation. S-Palmitoylation targets 18 Cys within the N-terminal, cytoplasmic region of RyR1, which are clustered in multiple functional domains including those implicated in the activity-governing protein-protein interactions of RyR1 with the L-type Ca2+ channel CaV1.1, calmodulin, and the FK506-binding protein FKBP12, as well as in “hot spot” regions containing sites of mutations implicated in malignant hyperthermia and central core disease. Eight of these Cys have been identified previously as subject to physiological S-nitrosylation or S-oxidation. Diminishing S-palmitoylation directly suppresses RyR1 activity as well as stimulus-coupled Ca2+ release through RyR1. These findings demonstrate functional regulation of RyR1 by a previously unreported post-translational modification and indicate the potential for extensive Cys-based signaling cross-talk.

https://openalex.org/W2079924157,"The tumor suppressor gene ST18 was originally characterized as the third member of the neural zinc finger transcription factor family. However, little is known about its biological functions. Herein, we demonstrate that, in the pancreas, ST18 expression is restricted to endocrine cells. The detection of ST18 expression in pancreatic β-cells prompted us to investigate its regulation and its role in β-cell mass and function. We show that ST18 expression and activity are increased by cytotoxic concentrations of fatty acids and cytokines in INS832/13 cells. Furthermore, ST18 is also increased in islets of diet-induced obese animals. Overexpression and RNA interference knockdown studies demonstrate that ST18 induces β-cell apoptosis and curtails β-cell replication. Finally, our data suggest that ST18 impairs insulin secretion. Taken together, our findings indicate that ST18 could represent a novel transcriptional mediator of lipotoxicity and cytokine-induced β-cell death. We suggest that genetic or pharmacologic manipulations of ST18 could help maintain a functional β-cell mass."

https://openalex.org/W1973850784,"Embryonic neural crest cells contribute to the development of the craniofacial mesenchyme, forebrain meninges and perivascular cells. In this study, we investigated the function of ß-catenin signaling in neural crest cells abutting the dorsal forebrain during development. In the absence of ß-catenin signaling, neural crest cells failed to expand in the interhemispheric region and produced ectopic smooth muscle cells instead of generating dermal and calvarial mesenchyme. In contrast, constitutive expression of stabilized ß-catenin in neural crest cells increased the number of mesenchymal lineage precursors suggesting that ß-catenin signaling is necessary for the expansion of neural crest-derived mesenchymal cells. Interestingly, the loss of neural crest-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) leads to failure of telencephalic midline invagination and causes ventricular system defects. This study shows that ß-catenin signaling is required for the switch of neural crest cells to MSCs and mediates the expansion of MSCs to drive the formation of mesenchymal structures of the head. Furthermore, loss of these structures causes striking defects in forebrain morphogenesis."

Coupling to its cognate protein, Gs, occurs via restricted collision coupling and is contingent on the presence of cholesterol.

We explored the contribution of the hydrophobic core and of the extended C terminus by examining diffusion of quantum dot-labeled receptor variants in dissociated hippocampal neurons. Single particle tracking of the A2A receptor(1–311), which lacks the last 101 residues, revealed that agonist-induced confinement was abolished and that the agonist-induced decrease in diffusivity was reduced substantially. A fragment comprising the SH3 domain and the guanylate kinase domain of synapse-associated protein 102 (SAP102) was identified as a candidate interactor that bound to the A2A receptor C terminus. Complex formation between the A2A receptor and SAP102 was verified by coimmunoprecipitation and by tracking its impact on receptor diffusion. An analysis of all trajectories by a hidden Markov model was consistent with two diffusion states where agonist activation reduced the transition between the two states and, thus, promoted the accumulation of the A2A receptor in the compartment with slow mobility. Overexpression of SAP102 precluded the access of the A2A receptor to a compartment with restricted mobility. In contrast, a mutated A2A receptor (with 383DVELL387 replaced by RVRAA) was insensitive to the action of SAP102.

The extended carboxyl terminus allows for regulatory input by scaffolding molecules such as SAP102. Adenosine is the metabolite of last resort. Cell damage and hypoxia lead to its extracellular accumulation. As a consequence, four G protein-coupled receptors (termed A1, A2A, A2B, and A3) are activated. The combined action of these four receptors is to orchestrate short- and long-term responses that further mitigate cell damage and activate tissue repair (1.Klinger M. Freissmuth M. Nanoff C. Adenosine receptors. G protein signalling and the role of accessory proteins.Cell Signal. 2002; 14: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). This retaliatory metabolite concept can be exemplified by considering the role of the Gs-coupled A2A receptor in the vasculature, where short-term activation leads to vasodilation and increased blood supply, and long-term activation causes endothelial cell proliferation (2.Sexl V. Mancusi G. Baumgartner-Parzer S. Schütz W. Freissmuth M. Stimulation of human umbilical vein endothelial cell proliferation by A2-adenosine and β2-adrenoceptors.Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 114: 1577-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In addition, adenosine is formed by the sequential action of ectonucleotidases from ATP that is stored in and released from synaptic vesicles (3.Abbracchio M.P. Burnstock G. Verkhratsky A. Zimmermann H. Purinergic signalling in the nervous system. An overview.Trends Neurosci. 2009; 32: 19-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Thus, in the nervous system, adenosine acts as a neuromodulator. In the indirect pathway of the basal ganglia, for instance, volume transmission by adenosine engages striatal A2A receptors and determines the set point for wired transmission (4.Fuxe K. Borroto-Escuela D.O. Romero-Fernandez W. Diaz-Cabiale Z. Rivera A. Ferraro L. Tanganelli S. Tarakanov A.O. Garriga P. Narváez J.A. Ciruela F. Guescini M. Agnati L.F.

Accordingly, genetic deletion of A2A receptors in the brain has complex phenotypic consequences, depending on whether the receptor is deleted globally or eliminated from specific regions (5.Wei C.J.

We examined previously the diffusion mode of the A2A receptor and an artificially palmitoylated version thereof by single particle tracking. These experiments indicated that the absence of the palmitoylated cysteine was required for restricted collision coupling. In addition, the experiment showed that lack of the C-terminal palmitoyl moiety promoted association of the agonist-activated A2A receptor with detergent-resistant membranes and confinement in areas compatible in size with lipid rafts (17.Keuerleber S.

In a parsimonious explanation, agonist-induced changes in the conformation of the heptahelical hydrophobic core determine the diffusive properties of the A2A receptor by increasing its dwell time in cholesterol-rich lipid microdomains. Alternatively, the A2A receptor may be tethered to additional molecules via its extended carboxyl terminus, and this may impinge on its diffusive properties. Here we examined the contribution of the C terminus by comparing the diffusion of a truncated but signaling-competent receptor with the full-length receptor in dissociated hippocampal neurons. The experiments showed that the hydrophobic core does not suffice to explain the diffusive properties of the receptor. The C terminus specifies access of the receptor to areas of low mobility by recruiting scaffolding molecules, one of which was identified as SAP102.

Papain-digested brain tissue (papain, 25 units/ml in Leibovitz L-15 medium containing 2 mm kynurenic acid) was dissociated by trituration. Cells were resuspended in culture medium (Neurobasal A, 2% B27, 1% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 0.4 mm glutamine, and 50 μm kynurenic acid) and plated on glass coverslips coated with poly-d-lysine. The culture medium contained 5-fluorouracil (20 μm) to inhibit cell proliferation. After 5 days, cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Single particle tracking experiments were performed after 7 days in culture. Images of hippocampal neurons cotransfected with the A2A-receptor-CFP and YFP-SAP102 expression vectors were recorded with an epifluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axiovert 200 M) at ×63 magnification. The single particle tracking experiments were performed as described previously in detail (17.Keuerleber S. Thurner P. Gruber C.W. Zezula J. Freissmuth M.

Briefly, transfected cells on coated glass coverslips were labeled with primary antibody recognizing the receptor FLAG epitope and the anti-mouse F(ab′)2-fragment-quantum dot conjugate. Quantum dot conjugates (Q-dots) were mixed with M2 anti-FLAG antibody at equimolar concentrations in Krebs-HEPES buffer (10 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 120 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, and 22 mm glucose) containing 3% casein for blocking of nonspecific binding sites. From this mixture, which contained quantum dots at a concentration of 0.5 μm and antibody at 0.5 μg/μl, aliquots were diluted (∼1:104-1:105) for labeling. After incubating for 20 min at 37 °C, coverslips were rinsed with Krebs-HEPES buffer, inserted into a microscopy chamber (buffer-filled volume of ∼50 μl), and transferred onto the heated stage of an Axiovert 135 M inverted epifluorescence microscope. Recordings were performed at 37° in the presence of adenosine deaminase (5 μg/ml) and, if indicated, of CGS21680 (10 μm). Optical stacks were acquired in Visiview 1.7.0 (Visitron Systems, Puchheim, Germany) as described previously (17.Keuerleber S. Thurner P. Gruber C.W. Zezula J. Freissmuth M.

An intermission by quantum dot blinking of 10 frames duration was tolerated. Recordings with longer blinking events were dismissed, as were trajectories with out-of-focus events. Stacks were recorded at a rate of 50 frames/s, except when full frames were acquired (∼30 frames/s). To exclude spurious trajectories, cells were visualized by bright field illumination immediately after the fluorescence recordings. Stack files were analyzed in MATLAB R2009a (MathWorks, Natick, MA) as described previously (17.Keuerleber S. Thurner P. Gruber C.W. Zezula J. Freissmuth M.

The mean square displacement (MSD) of each particle was calculated using Equation 1, MSD ( n δ t ) = 1 / ( N ‐ 1 ‐ n ) ∑ [ x ( j δ t + n δ t ) - x ( j δ t ) ] 2 + [ y ( j δ t + n δ t ) - y ( j δ t ) ] 2 (Eq. 1) where n is the time lag from start (number of frames), δt is the duration of the optical frame in milliseconds, N is the total number of frames, and j is the index to Σ. Microscopic diffusion coefficients (Dinitial) were estimated by fitting the initial four data points of the mean square displacement (MSDinitial) curve to an affine function (Equation 2), MSD initial ( ∆ t ) = 4 × D initial × ∆ t + 2 σ 2 (Eq. 2) where σ returns the y axis intercept of the linear regression. The pool of Dinitial values obtained in a given experiment (trajectories collected in an experimental setting as defined by the construct(s) used for transfection and by the presence of the receptor agonist during recordings and typically amounting to more than 200 values each) was subjected to a cumulative frequency distribution analysis and depicted as bar chart histogram. In addition, the diffusion mode of each individual trajectory was examined for deviation from random walk (i.e. Brownian) motion, where the cumulative mean square displacement of the particle extends linearly with time. The classification of tracks as following directed or confined diffusion relied on the goodness of fit when tracks were fitted to equations 3 and 4. A diffusion mode was categorized as “confined diffusion” if, according to Equation 3, the ratio of Dintial values over the maximum displacement between any two points of the trajectory (R2) was found to be larger than a predefined threshold (log10 (ψ), set to a conservative value of 10). log 10 ( ψ ) = 0 . 2048 - 2 . 5117 × D initial × t R 2 (Eq. 3) Trajectories displaying a log10 (ψ) greater than the threshold were then fitted by the trust region method to estimate the range covered by a particle traveling in confined diffusion mode. The criterion for “directed diffusion” was met if MSD data were fitted with appreciable goodness to a second-degree polynomial function (Equation 4). MSD = 4 σ 2 + 4 D × ∆ t + ( v × ∆ t ) 2 (Eq. 4) Particles were classified as immobile if none of the derived Dinitial values exceeded a preset value of 0.0075 μm2/s. Assigning particle tracks to non-random motion must inevitably be ambiguous because any given track or major segments of it may occur with residual probability by random movement (20.Wilson K.M. Morrison I.E. Smith P.R. Fernandez N. Cherry R.J. Single particle tracking of cell-surface HLA-DR molecules using R-phycoerythrin labelled monoclonal antibodies and fluorescence digital imaging.J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2101-2109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the automated assignment prevents a significant bias in quantifying the relative size of the four groups of tracks. Pooled trajectories were fitted to a two-state hidden Markov process (21.Das R. Cairo C.W. Coombs D. A hidden Markov model for single particle tracks quantifies dynamic interactions between LFA-1 and the actin cytoskeleton.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2009; 5: e1000556Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Maximum likelihood optimization with a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm returns estimates of the underlying parameters. The set of parameter estimates (θ) comprises the diffusion coefficients characteristic of states 1 and 2 (D1 and D2) and the probabilities of the particle transitioning between state 1 and state 2 (p12 and p21). We implemented, in MATLAB R2011a, the algorithms devised by Das et al. (21.Das R. Cairo C.W. Coombs D. A hidden Markov model for single particle tracks quantifies dynamic interactions between LFA-1 and the actin cytoskeleton.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2009; 5: e1000556Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). For an estimation of forward-backward variables, we made use of the compatible fwdback.m program file, which replaced algorithms 2 and 4 in Ref. 21.Das R. Cairo C.W. Coombs D. A hidden Markov model for single particle tracks quantifies dynamic interactions between LFA-1 and the actin cytoskeleton.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2009; 5: e1000556Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar. The likelihood of the estimate of θ is proportional to the joint probability density function of all the tracks from one experimental group as given by L ( θ | T j N ) ~ P ( T j N | θ ) = ∏ j = 1 N ( P ( T j | θ ) ) (Eq. 5) where Tj is the observed jth trajectory, N is the number of all trajectories per group, and P is the probability of a given trajectory to obey the parameters θ. The burn-in period consisted of 2 × 103 iterations, and the full routine was completed after 2 × 104 iterations. The maximum likelihood estimate for each of the four parameters was derived from a histogram of accepted parameters after burn-in. The coefficient of variation (CV) was calculated in percent of the estimate according to Equation 6, C V % = σ μ × 100 (Eq. 6) where σ is the standard deviation and μ is the mean for the parameter distribution obtained from the optimization procedure. CV values were typically below 1% except where indicated. Optimized parameter estimates were further used to calculate the distribution between mobility states 1 and 2 (π1 and π2, Equation 7). π 1 = p 21 p 21 + p 12 (Eq. 7) Overall mobility of the receptor in an experiment is captured by the effective diffusion coefficient Deff (Equation 8).

https://openalex.org/W1973925102,"To fully define the grammar of American Sign Language (ASL), a linguistic model of its nonmanuals needs to be constructed. While significant progress has been made to understand the features defining ASL manuals, after years of research, much still needs to be done to uncover the discriminant nonmanual components. The major barrier to achieving this goal is the difficulty in correlating facial features and linguistic features, especially since these correlations may be temporally defined. For example, a facial feature (e.g., head moves down) occurring at the end of the movement of another facial feature (e.g., brows moves up), may specify a Hypothetical conditional, but only if this time relationship is maintained. In other instances, the single occurrence of a movement (e.g., brows move up) can be indicative of the same grammatical construction. In the present paper, we introduce a linguistic-computational approach to efficiently carry out this analysis. First, a linguistic model of the face is used to manually annotate a very large set of 2,347 videos of ASL nonmanuals (including tens of thousands of frames). Second, a computational approach is used to determine which features of the linguistic model are more informative of the grammatical rules under study. We used the proposed approach to study five types of sentences--Hypothetical conditionals, Yes/no questions, Wh-questions, Wh-questions postposed, and Assertions--plus their polarities--positive and negative. Our results verify several components of the standard model of ASL nonmanuals and, most importantly, identify several previously unreported features and their temporal relationship. Notably, our results uncovered a complex interaction between head position and mouth shape. These findings define some temporal structures of ASL nonmanuals not previously detected by other approaches."

AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) senses energetic changes and regulates glucose metabolism. In this study, we examined the mechanisms by which AMPK promotes metabolic adaptation in the tumor-bearing liver using a murine model of colon cancer liver metastasis. Knock-out of AMPK α2 significantly enhanced tumor-induced glucose deprivation in the liver and increased the extent of liver injury and hepatocyte death. Mechanistically, we observed that AMPK α2 deficiency resulted in elevated reactive oxygen species, reduced mitophagy, and increased cell death in response to tumors or glucose deprivation in vitro. These results imply that AMPK α2 is essential for attenuation of liver injury during tumor metastasis via hepatic glucose deprivation and mitophagy-mediated inhibition of reactive oxygen species production.

Many studies have attempted to discover therapeutic targets to cure ADPKD. Rapamycin (sirolimus) is one of the most widely used anticancer drugs. It specifically inhibits mTORC1, suppressing cell proliferation. Rapamycin has been applied to various animal models to evaluate its therapeutic effect on ADPKD. It had a dramatic curative effect on ADPKD in preclinical trials (3.Novalic Z. van der Wal A.M. Leonhard W.N. Koehl G. Breuning M.H. Geissler E.K. de Heer E. Peters D.J.

Roscovitine, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, has been tested in jck and cpk mice. Roscovitine administration effectively induces cell cycle arrest, which results in cyst regression (7.Bukanov N.O. Smith L.A. Klinger K.W. Ledbetter S.R. Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya O. Long-lasting arrest of murine polycystic kidney disease with CDK inhibitor roscovitine.Nature. 2006; 444: 949-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In addition, metformin has been suggested as a new inhibitor against the mTOR pathway. Metformin activates AMP-activated protein kinase, which consequently suppresses mTORC signaling (8.Takiar V.

Although several target genes for ADPKD therapy have been suggested, no effective treatment is currently available. In our previous study, the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) was proposed as a potential therapeutic target for polycystic kidney disease (PKD) (11.Park E.Y. Seo M.J. Park J.H.

These mice have enlarged kidneys with numerous cysts, but they live for only 1 month (22.Park E.Y. Sung Y.H. Yang M.H. Noh J.Y. Park S.Y. Lee T.Y. Yook Y.J. Yoo K.H. Roh K.J. Kim I. Hwang Y.H.

Many cytokines and growth factors in cyst fluid affect the inflammatory response, but some molecules are specifically related to cyst enlargement in PKD (23.Cowley Jr., B.D. Ricardo S.D. Nagao S.

For example, overexpression of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) carried by an adenoviral delivery system attenuates cystic growth in Pkd1flox/−:Ksp-Cre mice (24.Wei F. Karihaloo A.

In the present study, we injected adenovirus containing anti-RAGE shRNA into PC2R mice to determine the effect of RAGE on cystogenesis. The reduction in RAGE resulted in slowed cyst growth in vitro and in vivo by decreasing phosphorylated extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) signaling. Furthermore, renal function was improved in the anti-RAGE adenovirus-treated group compared with that in the adenovirus-treated control group by checking the renal function markers blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine. We suggest that RAGE-related signaling may be closely associated with PKD and that RAGE could be a new potential therapeutic target for PKD. We performed an in vitro assay in WT 9-12 cells to confirm whether the generated adenovirus works well. WT 9-12 cells are renal epithelial cells isolated from proximal and distal tubules of human patients with ADPKD. This cell line was purchased from ATCC, and it grows on bovine collagen-coated culture dishes. Approximately 3.5 × 105 cells were seeded in 100-mm dishes, and the adenovirus was applied in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. WT 9-12 cells were infected by adenovirus (multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) = 200). At 24 h after infection, 5 × 103 cells were seeded in each well of a 24-well culture plate. We used the XTT cell proliferation kit (11465015001; Roche Applied Science) and conducted experiments following the manufacturer's instructions. The absorbance was measured at 470 nm. The total number of adenovirus-treated cells was counted using a hemocytometer. The counting experiments were performed three times independently. We adhered to the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals or the equivalent. Mice were cared for under optimal conditions of 12-h light and 12-h dark at 20 °C and 50% humidity, and they had free access to sterilized water and food. PC2R mice were generated by mating human PKD2 transgenic mice with Pkd2+/− mice. Human PKD2 transgenic mice were generated by our laboratory (22.Park E.Y. Sung Y.H. Yang M.H. Noh J.Y. Park S.Y.

Chem. 2009; 284: 7214-7222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and Pkd2+/− mice were obtained from Dr. Stefan Somlo. The PC2R mice were C57BL/6. Experiments using mice were approved by Sookmyung Women's University (SMU-IACUC-2011-0516-008). The PC2R genotyping primers were as follows: human PKD2 forward primer, 5′-ACTGACCGAACATGAACATCA-3′ and reverse primer, 5′-AACCATGACTGATCTGGGAAG-3′; mouse Pkd2, 5′-GCGCCGGCCTAGCTGTCCC-3′, 5′-GTTGTCGCGGCTCCACG-3′, and 5′-GTGCTACTTCCATTTGTCACGTCCTGC-3′. The PCR product of the human PKD2 gene was 500 bp, the wild-type mouse Pkd2 gene was 150 bp, and the knock-out was 350 bp. The genetic status of the PC2R mice was characterized by complete loss of the mouse Pkd2 gene (−/−) but the presence of the human PKD2 gene (+). Genenmed Inc. (Seoul, South Korea) produced control adenovirus and anti-mRAGE shRNA encoding adenovirus. The pAd lox vector has a CMV promoter, and the construct produces adenovirus under the control of the cre-lox recombination system (25.Hardy S. Kitamura M. Harris-Stansil T. Dai Y. Phipps M.L. Construction of adenovirus vectors through Cre-lox recombination.J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1842-1849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For in vivo study, generated adenovirus in HEK293 cells was purified and concentrated (final concentration: 3∼8 × 1011/ml). PC2R mice were utilized at P6 for adenovirus injection. We injected adenovirus (3 × 108 pfu/day) intravenously three times (at P6, P8, and P10) into PC2R mice, and the mice were sacrificed at P15. Kidneys were isolated from mice and fixed in 10% formalin (HT-5011; Sigma). Paraffin-embedded kidneys were sliced into 5-μm width sections. The sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) to observe the entire shape and size of the kidney. Kidney morphology was imaged with an Olympus microscope (Olympus IX81, Tokyo, Japan) and a scan slide module with MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices Corp., Downingtown, PA). Unstained paraffin sections were incubated at 60 °C for 1 h for immunohistochemistry and were consecutively rehydrated in ethanol. Antigen retrieval was performed in a 0.01 m citric acid solution (pH 6.0). After blocking, anti-PCNA primary antibody (FL-261; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-p-ERK primary antibody (4377; Cell Signaling Technology) were added to the sections, and the sections were incubated at 4 °C overnight. Sections were stained with an ABC kit (PK-6200; Vector Laboratories) and a NovaRed kit (SK-4800; Vector Laboratories). H&E staining was performed as a counterstain. Paraffin-embedded kidney sections were rehydrated in serially diluted ethanol, and a 0.01 m citric acid solution was used for antigen retrieval. The following renal tubule markers were used: anti-LTA antibody (FL-1321; Vector Laboratories) for proximal tubules, anti-THP antibody (H-135; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for distal tubules, and anti-DBA antibody (FL-1031; Vector Laboratories) for the collecting duct tubules. DAPI staining was performed to label the nuclei. Fluorescent signals were detected with a fluorescence microscope, and the cystic area was measured automatically using MetaMorph software. Blood was collected from the posterior vena cava and the heart. Serum was isolated in Vacutainers (368972; BD Biosciences), and the BUN and creatinine analysis was performed by Dr. Chulho Lee's laboratory using a Hitachi 7150 Clinical Analyzer (KRIBB, Daejeon, South Korea). A NucleoSpin (Macherey-Nagel, Dueren, Germany) kit was used for isolating mRNA from samples. cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of mRNA with M-MLV reverse transcriptase. A Rotor-Gene PCR machine and software (RG-3000A; Qiagen) were utilized for real time RT-PCR. The diluted cDNA was mixed with SYBR Green (HiTaq SYBR, Q100220; GenePole, South Korea) and the following primers: human RAGE forward, 5′-GAAGGAACAGACCAGGAGACACC-3′ and reverse, 5′-TGCCACAAGATGACCCCAATG-3′; human β-actin forward, 5′-AAGGCCAACCGCGAGAAGAT-3′ and reverse, 5′-CCAGAGGCGTACAGGGATAGCAC-3′. Total protein was extracted from mouse kidneys using Nucleospin (Macherey-Nagel), and protein concentration was measured using a BCA assay (bicinchoninic acid solution, copper II sulfate; Sigma). Protein (30 μg) was separated on a 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel and transferred to PVDF membranes (Pall Corp., Port Washington, NY). The primary antibodies used were RAGE (ab3611; Abcam, Cambridge, MA), β-actin (A300-491A; Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX), p-ERK (4377; Cell Signaling Technology), ERK (9102; Cell Signaling Technology), p-AKT (4060; Cell Signaling Technology), AKT (4691; Cell Signaling Technology), p-MEK (2338; Cell Signaling Technology), MEK (4694; Cell Signaling Technology), p-p38 (9216; Cell Signaling Technology), and p-38 (9212; Cell Signaling Technology). Chemiluminescent signals were detected on an LAS-3000 imager (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). A stripping solution (0.2 m glycine (pH 2.8) and 0.5 m NaCl) was utilized to remove antibodies used previously. The one-tailed t test was performed using GraphPad Prism6 software. A p value < 0.05 was considered significant. We previously demonstrated that inhibiting RAGE expression decreases cyst growth under three-dimensional culture conditions (11.Park E.Y. Seo M.J. Park J.H. Effects of specific genes activating RAGE on polycystic kidney disease.Am. J. Nephrol. 2010; 32: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Because of the long lasting effects of inhibiting RAGE in vitro and in vivo, we generated an adenovirus containing shRNA against RAGE to block downstream RAGE signaling. To confirm the effect of the generated virus, we infected the WT 9-12 cell line with the anti-RAGE adenovirus. Expression levels of RAGE decreased in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown). The anti-RAGE adenovirus (m.o.i. = 200) was added to the cells and reduced RAGE expression in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1, A and B). To determine the effect of RAGE on regulating cell proliferation, WT 9-12 cells were infected with control or anti-RAGE adenovirus (m.o.i. = 200). As a result, down-regulation of RAGE caused a reduction in both viable cell number (Fig. 1C) and total cell number (Fig. 1D) compared with control adenovirus-treated cells at 72 h after infection. These data demonstrate that suppressing RAGE inhibited cell growth in PKD cells. Conditional Pkd1 and Pkd2 knock-out mice have been used previously (24.Wei F. Karihaloo A. Yu Z. Marlier A. Seth P.

The PC2R mouse is a partially rescued Pkd2 knock-out mouse with the human PKD2 transgene, and it has a average lifespan of 28–36 days, similar to Pkd1 or Pkd2 conditional mice (22.Park E.Y. Sung Y.H.

PC2R mice exhibited a smaller body size and lower body weight at P15 than those of wild-type littermates (Fig. 2, A and B, PC2R mice, 5.66 ± 0.98 g, n = 7; wild-type mice, 7.18 ± 1.06 g, n = 5). Further examination revealed that PC2R mice had severe bilateral polycystic kidneys (Fig. 2C). Thus, we thought that PC2R mice were suitable for an experimental therapeutic test. To determine whether the effect of inhibiting RAGE was reproduced in vivo, we utilized PC2R mice in the present study. These mice were injected in the tail vein on P6, P8, and P10 with anti-RAGE adenovirus or control adenovirus (Fig. 3A). The effect of anti-RAGE adenovirus in vivo was sustained for a maximum of 5 days after injection (Fig. 3B). Thus, the mice were killed at P15, and the kidneys were examined. PC2R mice had a high level of RAGE expression compared with WT littermate mice. The anti-RAGE adenovirus-injected pups exhibited down-regulated RAGE expression compared with control pups in terms of mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 3, C and D). RAGE expression was down-regulated by ∼30–40% following anti-RAGE adenovirus treatment in kidney tissues (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, the kidneys of anti-RAGE adenovirus-injected mice had smaller cysts compared with those in control adenovirus-injected mice (Fig. 4A). The RAGE knock-down group showed a significant decrease in the ratio of kidney weight to body weight (Fig. 4B, right). Down-regulated RAGE led to a significant suppression not only in cystogenesis, but also in BUN and creatinine serum levels (Fig. 4C). These results demonstrate that inhibiting RAGE using an adenovirus system suppressed cyst formation in vivo. Renal tubular cysts arise from multiple tubule segments, and the origins of the cysts can be determined by staining with specific antibodies, such as LTA (proximal tubule), DBA (collecting tubule), and THP (distal tubule) (21.Wu G. D'Agati V. Cai Y. Markowitz G. Park J.H. Reynolds D.M. Maeda Y. Le T.C. Hou Jr., H. Kucherlapati R. Edelmann W. Somlo S.

Chem. 2009; 284: 7214-7222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We were able to verify the change in size and the origin of the cysts by using immunohistochemistry with segment-specific antibodies in the anti-RAGE adenovirus-treated and control groups. The PC2R mice developed cysts in multiple parts of the nephron, and the majority of large cysts were stained positively with the collecting duct marker, DBA. In Fig. 5, A and B, we showed that suppressing RAGE by the adenovirus system led to attenuated cyst formation in different nephron segments. Therefore, our data indicate that RAGE inhibition is highly effective against cyst enlargement in PC2R mice. RAGE interacts directly with ERK1 and ERK2, leading to activation of p38 MAPK and NF-κB (28.Ishihara K. Tsutsumi K. Kawane S. Nakajima M. Kasaoka T.

Moreover, blocking RAGE with a neutralizing antibody reduces connective tissue growth factor and phosphorylated ERK expression in diabetic nephropathy (30.Chung A.C. Zhang H. Kong Y.Z. Tan J.J. Huang X.R. Kopp J.B. Lan H.Y. Advanced glycation end products induce tubular CTGF via TGF-β-independent Smad3 signaling.J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2010; 21: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). As the main feature in cystic tissues is aberrant proliferation, we analyzed the effect of RAGE silencing on the proliferation of cystic epithelial regions. First, the number of PCNA-positive cells decreased in cystic epithelia of anti-RAGE adenovirus-injected mice kidneys (Fig. 6A, quantified in Fig. 6B, Con Ad, 17.81 ± 4.8; RAGE Ad, 10.5 ± 2.2). Activation of MAPK/ERK is important for cyst enlargement in PKD and is a cell proliferation marker in PKD (31.Torres V.E. Harris P.C.

Phosphorylated ERK decreased in cyst-lined epithelial cells of anti-RAGE adenovirus-injected mice (Fig. 6C). However, cyst-surrounding tubules showed a positive signal for phosphorylated ERK in both adenovirus-treated PC2R groups and WT group. RAGE associates with multiple signaling pathways, including the PI3K/Akt, MAPK pathways, and NF-κB signaling (33.Riehl A. Németh J. Angel P. Hess J.

https://openalex.org/W2073722688,"Advances in understanding the process of species formation require an integrated perspective that includes the evaluation of spatial, ecological and genetic components. One approach is to focus on multiple stages of divergence within the same species. Species that comprise phenotypically different populations segregated in apparently distinct habitats, in which range is presently continuous but was putatively geographically isolated provide an interesting system to study the mechanisms of population divergence. Here, we attempt to elucidate the role of ecology and geography in explaining observed morphological and genetic variation in an understorey-dwelling bird endemic to southeastern Africa, where two subspecies are recognized according to phenotype and habitat affinity. We carried out a range-wide analysis of climatic requirements, morphological and genetic variation across southeast Africa to test the hypothesis that the extent of gene flow among populations of the brown scrub-robin are influenced by their distinct climatic niches. We recovered two distinct trends depending on whether our analyses were hierarchically structured at the subspecies or at the within subspecies level. Between subspecies we found pronounced morphological differentiation associated with strong reproductive isolation (no gene flow) between populations occupying divergent climatic niches characterized by changes in the temperature of the warmest and wettest month. In contrast, within subspecies, we recovered continuous morphological variation with extensive gene flow among populations inhabiting the temperate and sub-tropical forests of southern Africa, despite divergence along the climate axis that is mainly determined by minimum temperature and precipitation of the coldest months. Our results highlight the role of niche divergence as a diversifying force that can promote reproductive isolation in vertebrates."

Design Cross-sectional measurement of iohexol-based GFR (iGFR) in HIV(+) men (n = 455) receiving antiretroviral therapy, and HIV-uninfected (HIV(−)) men (n = 258) in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study. Methods iGFR was calculated from disappearance of infused iohexol from plasma. Determinants of GFR and the presence of CKD were compared using iGFR and GFR estimated by the CKD-Epi equation (eGFR). Results Median iGFR was higher among HIV(+) than HIV(−) men (109 vs. 106 ml/min/1.73 m2, respectively, p = .046), and was 7 ml/min higher than median eGFR. Mean iGFR was lower in men who were older, had chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, or had a history of AIDS. Low iGFR (≤90 ml/min/1.73 m2) was associated with these factors and with black race. Other than age, factors associated with low iGFR were not observed with low eGFR. CKD was more common in HIV(+) than HIV(−) men; predictors of CKD were similar using iGFR and eGFR. Conclusions iGFR was higher than eGFR in this population of HIV-infected and -uninfected men who have sex with men. Presence of CKD was predicted equally well by iGFR and eGFR, but associations of chronic HCV infection and history of clinically-defined AIDS with mildly decreased GFR were seen only with iGFR."
https://openalex.org/W2056490157,"Background China's one-child-per-couple policy, introduced in 1979, led to profound demographic changes for nearly a quarter of the world's population. Several decades later, the consequences include decreased fertility rates, population aging, decreased household sizes, changes in family structure, and imbalanced sex ratios. The epidemiology of communicable diseases may have been affected by these changes since the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases depend on demographic characteristics of the population. Of particular interest is influenza because China and Southeast Asia lie at the center of a global transmission network of influenza. Moreover, changes in household structure may affect influenza transmission. Is it possible that the pronounced demographic changes that have occurred in China have affected influenza transmission? Methods and Findings To address this question, we developed a continuous-time, stochastic, individual-based simulation model for influenza transmission. With this model, we simulated 30 years of influenza transmission and compared influenza transmission rates in populations with and without the one-child policy control. We found that the average annual attack rate is reduced by 6.08% (SD 2.21%) in the presence of the one-child policy compared to a population in which no demographic changes occurred. There was no discernible difference in the secondary attack rate, −0.15% (SD 1.85%), between the populations with and without a one-child policy. We also forecasted influenza transmission over a ten-year time period in a population with a two-child policy under a hypothesis that a two-child-per-couple policy will be carried out in 2015, and found a negligible difference in the average annual attack rate compared to the population with the one-child policy. Conclusions This study found that the average annual attack rate is slightly lowered in a population with a one-child policy, which may have resulted from a decrease in household size and the proportion of children in the population."

The molecular mechanism by which ligand binding leads to channel opening remains poorly understood, due in part to the lack of a robust method for preparing sufficient amounts of purified, stable protein required for structural and biochemical characterization.

This chimera demonstrates KcsA-like pH-sensitive activity which is modulated by cAMP, reminiscent of the dual modulation in hyperpolarization-activated and cyclic nucleotide-gated channels that display voltage-dependent activity that is also modulated by cAMP. Using this chimeric construct, we were able to measure for the first time the binding thermodynamics of cAMP to an intact cyclic nucleotide-modulated ion channel using isothermal titration calorimetry. The energetics of ligand binding to channels reconstituted in lipid bilayers are substantially different from those observed in detergent micelles, suggesting that the conformation of the chimera's transmembrane domain is sensitive to its (lipid or lipid-mimetic) environment and that ligand binding induces conformational changes in the transmembrane domain. Nevertheless, because cAMP on its own does not activate these chimeric channels, cAMP binding likely has a smaller energetic contribution to gating than proton binding suggesting that there is only a small difference in cAMP binding energy between the open and closed states of the channel.

In addition to the four-helix voltage sensor domain and two-helix pore domain of each monomeric subunit, these channels contain a cyclic nucleotide-binding domain (CNBD) at the C terminus, which is connected to the pore-forming S6 helix via a so-called C-linker. The CNBD and C-linkers are conserved within this subfamily of channels (6.Shabb J.B. Corbin J.D. Cyclic nucleotide-binding domains in proteins having diverse functions.J. Biol.

Binding of cAMP to the CNBD in both CNG and HCN channels is believed to induce a conformational change that promotes channel opening. Current understanding largely derives from electrophysiological experiments on cells heterologously expressing these channels (1.Kaupp U.B. Seifert R. Cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels.Physiol.

Yet the molecular mechanism by which ligand binding to the CNBD changes the closed-open equilibrium (opens the pore) remains unknown. To acquire further insight into the mechanism(s) of HCN (and CNG) channel gating, we sought to probe the thermodynamics of ligand binding to the purified channel, isolated from other cellular components. This has proven difficult because heterologous expression of eukaryotic CNG and HCN channels so far has yielded insufficient functional protein for biochemical and biophysical studies. Only the cytoplasmic C termini (CNBDs with C-linker) from a few HCN channels have proven amenable to large scale purification and crystallization (15.Flynn G.E. Black K.D. Islas L.D. Sankaran B.

MloK1, an HCN channel homolog from Mesorhizobium loti, remains the most promising candidate for biophysical characterization, displaying cyclic nucleotide-dependent ion channel activity when reconstituted into liposomes (24.Clayton G.M.

MloK1 contains the signature GYG selectivity filter sequence found in HCN channels, but the “voltage sensor domain” lacks the arginine repeats that allow voltage sensing (26.Aggarwal S.K.

The transmembrane domain has a structure similar to that of other voltage-gated potassium channels, but the absence of the CNBDs precludes insight into ligand modulation of MloK1. The structures of the isolated MloK1 CNBDs, determined with and without ligand, show that cAMP binding leads to a clamping down of the C-terminal helix over the ligand-binding pocket and repositioning of the N-terminal helix, which in the full-length channel continues with the inner helix of the transmembrane domain (28.Schünke S. Stoldt M. Lecher J. Kaupp U.B. Willbold D. Structural insights into conformational changes of a cyclic nucleotide-binding domain in solution from Mesorhizobium loti K1 channel.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 6121-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In addition, a 16-Å electron microscopy-derived structure of full-length MloK1 in the presence of ligand reveals a symmetrical arrangement of the CNBDs around the transmembrane domain (30.Chiu P.L. Pagel M.D. Evans J. Chou H.T. Zeng X. Gipson B. Stahlberg H. Nimigean C.M. The structure of the prokaryotic cyclic nucleotide-modulated potassium channel MloK1 at 16 Å resolution.Structure. 2007; 15: 1053-1064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Currently, however, a high resolution structure of full-length MloK1 remains elusive, the protein detergent-solubilized is unstable, and binding and activity assays are challenging because of considerable difficulty in removing the ligand (cAMP) as well as protein aggregation at high concentrations. Finally, there have been no reports of successful electrical current measurements from this channel (24.Clayton G.M. Silverman W.R. Heginbotham L. Morais-Cabral J.H. Structural basis of ligand activation in a cyclic nucleotide regulated potassium channel.Cell. 2004; 119: 615-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 25.Nimigean C.M. Shane T. Miller C. A cyclic nucleotide modulated prokaryotic K+ channel.J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 124: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To overcome these difficulties and to obtain the desired information about cyclic nucleotide-channel interactions, we constructed a chimeric channel by attaching the CNBDs of MloK1 to the transmembrane domain of KcsA (Fig. 1A). The design of a conceptually similar chimeric channel (see under “Discussion”), with some functional differences, was reported previously by Ohndorf and MacKinnon (31.Ohndorf U.M. MacKinnon R. Construction of a cyclic nucleotide-gated KcsA K+ channel.J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 350: 857-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Overexpression and purification of the chimera in this report allow for studies that have proven intractable with the full-length MloK1 protein. We show that the chimeric channel is active and that its activity is modulated by pH in a similar manner to KcsA. In addition, the chimera is modulated by cAMP, albeit only in the presence of protons, suggesting the chimera's response to cyclic nucleotides is similar to that of HCN channels. Using this chimera, we were able for the first time to measure the thermodynamics of cAMP binding to a full-length cyclic nucleotide-modulated channel using ITC. Furthermore, we show that the incorporation of the channel in nanodiscs (also termed nanoscale apolipoprotein-bound bilayers, or NABBs (32.Banerjee S. Huber T. Sakmar T.P. Rapid incorporation of functional rhodopsin into nanoscale apolipoprotein bound bilayer (NABB) particles.J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 377: 1067-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 33.Banerjee S. Nimigean C.M. Non-vesicular transfer of membrane proteins from nanoparticles to lipid bilayers.J. Gen. Physiol. 2011; 137: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar)) leads to a 10-fold increase in the apparent cAMP affinity, as compared with the value obtained in detergent micelles. This affinity increase indicates that cAMP binding can induce a conformational change in the transmembrane domains, which are in direct contact with the lipid bilayer and remote from the CNBDs. At the same time, this conformational change is not sufficient by itself to open the channel, suggesting that the energetic contribution to channel opening from cAMP binding is much less than that from proton binding. DNA for the chimeric gene was generated through ligation of KcsA and MloK1 segments (Fig. 1A). The region of overlap between the two segments consists of an RRG sequence contained in residues 121–123 in KcsA and residues 219–221 in MloK1. The chimeric gene was cloned into the pQE60 (Qiagen) plasmid and contains an N-terminal hexahistidine tag. Protein expression was induced with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at an optical density of 0.8 in transformed BL21 (DE3) cells and grown overnight in LB at 20 °C. Pelleted cells were resuspended in a solution of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 200 μm cAMP and sonicated in the presence of leupeptin (2 mg/ml), pepstatin (3 mg/ml), and PMSF (0.17 mg/ml) (Roche Applied Science). The resulting slurry was gently shaken for 2 h with 30 mm n-decyl β-d-maltopyranoside (DM). The lysate was spun down at 32,000 × g and the supernatant applied over a Ni2+ HiTrap chelating column (GE Healthcare). Protein was eluted with 300 mm imidazole in 20 mm Tris, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm DM, 200 μm cAMP, pH 7.6, and further purified over a Superdex 200 10/300 GL gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) using a solution of 20 mm Tris, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm DM, 200 μm cAMP, pH 7.6. The protein concentration was calculated using a factor of 0.476 mg/ml chimera for an absorbance unit of 1 at a wavelength of 280 nm as determined with the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). Tightly bound cAMP was competed off of the chimeric protein with a low affinity analog, as described previously for MloK1 (34.Cukkemane A. Grüter B. Novak K. Gensch T. Bönigk W. Gerharz T. Kaupp U.B. Seifert R. Subunits act independently in a cyclic nucleotide-activated K+ channel.EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 749-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Protein was reloaded onto a Ni2+ HiTrap chelating column (GE Healthcare) and rinsed with a solution of 20 mm Tris, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm DM, pH 7.6 (Rinse Buffer), to remove free cAMP. The protein was then incubated with Rinse Buffer containing 1 mm 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-guanosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (8-pCPT-cGMP) (Sigma) for 30 min, followed by another rinse step, an additional 30-min incubation with 1 mm 8-pCPT-cGMP, another rinse step, an overnight incubation in 10 mm 8-pCPT-cGMP, and a final extensive rinse step using 40 column volumes of rinse buffer. Protein was eluted with 300 mm imidazole and then dialyzed overnight in Rinse Buffer. Chimeric protein for use in bilayer recordings included the construct described above (Fig. 1A) and a variant with an E71A mutation, which removes inactivation at the KcsA selectivity filter (35.Cordero-Morales J.F.

Biol. 2006; 13: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Following gel filtration, protein was reconstituted into liposomes as reported previously (36.Heginbotham L.

Liposome aliquots in reconstitution buffer were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored for future use. Thawed liposomes were briefly sonicated prior to use. Bilayers were assembled using a horizontal planar system with two chambers separated by a partition containing a 100-μm diameter hole (38.LeMasurier M. Heginbotham L. Miller C. KcsA: it's a potassium channel.J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The bilayer was formed manually by applying 10 mg/ml 3:1 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine/1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol in decane over the hole in the partition, and the bilayer formation was monitored electrically using a cycling voltage ramp (39.Chen T.Y. Miller C. Nonequilibrium gating and voltage dependence of the ClC-0 Cl− channel.J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 237-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The cis chamber was filled with 70 mm KCl, 30 mm KOH, 10 mm MOPS, 10 mm succinic acid, and 10 mm Tris, pH 7. The trans chamber was filled with an identical solution where pH varied between 4 and 5.5. Solutions of varying pH and cAMP concentrations were exchanged through the trans chamber. Currents were recorded in Clampex 10 with an Axopatch 200A, digitized with a Digidata 1322A, and analyzed in Clampfit (Molecular Devices). The thallium flux assay and data analysis were conducted as described previously (40.Rusinova R. Kim D.M. Nimigean C.M. Andersen O.S.

Screening for small molecules' bilayer-modifying potential using a gramicidin-based fluorescence assay.Assay Drug Dev. Technol. 2010; 8: 427-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The KcsA/MloK1 chimera used in the flux assay was dialyzed further to reduce the imidazole concentration to submillimolar levels and reconstituted into large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) at a weight ratio of 17 μg of protein to 1 mg of lipid in a 3:1 molar ratio of DOPC to 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (Avanti Polar Lipids) in 100 mm KNO3, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm succinic acid, 25 mm aminonaphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfonate (ANTS) (Sigma), pH 7.0, with 14 mm CHAPS. The suspension was sonicated until completely clear, and the detergent was removed through a 2-h incubation with Bio-Beads (Bio-Rad) (1 g of Bio-Beads/35 mg of CHAPS). The protein/lipid mixture was sonicated briefly, siphoned from the Bio-Beads, and extruded 42 times through a 0.1-μm polycarbonate filter. The external ANTS was removed over a PD-10 desalting column (GE Healthcare), and the LUVs were eluted in a solution of 140 mm KNO3, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm succinic acid, pH 7.0. LUVs with different cAMP concentrations were prepared in parallel, and the appropriate cAMP concentrations were maintained in all solutions used during the reconstitution and functional characterization. ANTS fluorescence quenching in response to thallium influx into the LUVs (through the chimeric channel) was measured using an Applied Photophysics SX.20 stopped-flow spectrophotometer with sequential mixing capability. The excitation wavelength was 352 nm, and the emitted light was recorded using a cutoff filter at 455 nm. Channel activity was determined using a sequential-push mixing sequence, where the LUVs were first rapidly mixed with a solution with a pH and cAMP concentration such that the extravesicular pH and [cAMP] in the mixing chamber had the desired value (40.Rusinova R. Kim D.M. Nimigean C.M. Andersen O.S. Regulation of ion channel function by the host lipid bilayer examined by a stopped-flow spectroflurorimetric assay.Biophys. J. 2014; 106: 1070-1078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). After a 100-ms equilibration, the LUVs were mixed with a solution containing 140 mm KNO3, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm succinic acid, and the appropriate cAMP concentration to determine the initial fluorescence level. Then the LUVs were mixed with the quench solution containing 50 mm TlNO3, 94 mm KNO3, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm succinic acid at the desired cAMP concentration and pH. The lipid bilayer has a very low Tl+ permeability, and Tl+ influx through the open channels caused quenching of the ANTS fluorescence. The fluorescence of the quenched samples was normalized to the initial fluorescence level and fit with a stretched exponential to the first 2–100 ms of the normalized fluorescence quench curve for each sample (41.Ingólfsson H.I. Andersen O.S. Screening for small molecules' bilayer-modifying potential using a gramicidin-based fluorescence assay.Assay Drug Dev. Technol. 2010; 8: 427-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) as shown in Equation 1, F(t)=F(∞)+(F(0)-F(∞))exp(-(t/τ0)β)(Eq. 1) where F(t) is the fluorescence at time t; τ0 is a coefficient with units of time, and β (0 < β ≤1) is a measure of the dispersity of LUV size. The rate of fluorescence quenching at 2 ms was then calculated using Equation 2, F(t)=(β/τ0)(t/τ0)(β-1)(Eq. 2) and changes in channel function were evaluated as the relative changes in k(2 ms). Chimeric channels were incorporated into nanodiscs using a method identical to that previously described for KcsA (33.Banerjee S. Nimigean C.M. Non-vesicular transfer of membrane proteins from nanoparticles to lipid bilayers.J. Gen. Physiol. 2011; 137: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For the apolipoprotein, a variant of the pET28 ZAP1 construct, ZAP1NT, in which the N-terminal 50 residues were truncated and a Q22C (Gln-54 in the original ZAP1) mutation added, was used for these experiments as the truncation results in improved yields. The cysteine was introduced for labeling purposes (described below). ZAP1NT was expressed in BL21 (DE3) cells upon induction with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at an optical density of 0.8 for 3 h at 37 °C in terrific broth media. Centrifuged cell pellets were resuspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, and 300 mm KCl and then sonicated in the presence of protease inhibitors. 6 m guanidinium chloride was added to the sonicated slurry followed by agitation at room temperature (or 4 °C) for 30 min. The lysate was spun down at 32,000 × g, pH adjusted to 7.6 with KOH, and then combined with 4 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Invitrogen) and equilibrated with 20 mm HEPES, pH 6.9, 150 mm KCl, and 6 m guanidinium chloride. The resin was washed twice with an equilibration buffer containing 30 mm imidazole and then one more time in equilibration buffer without the imidazole. 0.5 mm tetramethylrhodamine-5-maleimide was added to the ZAP1NT nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid slurry and allowed to incubate at 4 °C overnight. The ratio of absorbance at 280 nm from the ZAP1NT to the absorbance at 550 nm due to the tag provides a means of separating the 280-nm absorbance signal belonging to the chimeric channel from that of ZAP1NT in the final channel-containing nanodisc, as described previously (32.Banerjee S.

https://openalex.org/W2082857385,"Apolipoprotein B (apoB) is the principal protein component of triacylglyceride (TAG)-rich lipoproteins, including chylomicrons and very low density lipoprotein, which is the precursor to LDL (the ""bad cholesterol""). TAG-rich lipoprotein assembly is initiated by the N-terminal βα1 superdomain of apoB, which co-translationally binds and remodels the luminal leaflet of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The βα1 superdomain contains four domains and is predicted to interact directly with lipids. Using drop tensiometry, we examined the interfacial properties of the α-helical and C-sheet domains and several subdomains to establish a detailed structure-function relationship at the lipid/water interface. The adsorption, stress response, exchangeability, and pressure (Π)-area relationship were studied at both triolein/water and triolein/1-palmitoyl, 2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine/water interfaces that mimic physiological environments. The α-helical domain spontaneously adsorbed to a triolein/water interface and formed a viscoelastic surface. It was anchored to the surface by helix 6, and the other helices were ejected and/or remodeled on the surface as a function of surface pressure. The C-sheet instead formed an elastic film on a triolein/water interface and was irreversibly anchored to the lipid surface, which is consistent with the behavior of amphipathic β-strands. When both domains were adsorbed together on the surface, the C-sheet shielded a portion of the α-helical domain from the surface, which retained its globular structure. Overall, the unique secondary and tertiary structures of the N-terminal domains of apoB support the intrinsic capability of co-translational lipid recruitment. The evidence presented here allows the construction of a detailed model of the initiation of TAG-rich lipoprotein assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2067658147,"Quantitative descriptions of animal vocalizations can inform an understanding of their evolutionary functions, the mechanisms for their production and perception, and their potential utility in taxonomy, population monitoring, and conservation. The goal of this study was to provide the first acoustical and statistical analysis of the advertisement calls of Nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis. Commonly known as the Indian purple frog, N. sahyadrensis is an endangered species endemic to the Western Ghats of India. As the only known species in its family (Nasikabatrachidae), it has ancient evolutionary ties to frogs restricted to the Seychelles archipelago (Sooglossidae). The role of vocalizations in the behavior of this unique species poses interesting questions, as the animal is fossorial and potentially earless and it breeds explosively above the soil for only about two weeks a year. In this study, we quantified 19 acoustic properties of 208 calls recorded from 10 males. Vocalizations were organized into distinct call groups typically composed of two to six short (59 ms), pulsatile calls, each consisting of about five to seven pulses produced at a rate of about 106 pulses/s. The frequency content of the call consisted of a single dominant peak between 1200–1300 Hz and there was no frequency modulation. The patterns of variation within and among individuals were typical of those seen in other frogs. Few of the properties we measured were related to temperature, body size, or condition, though there was little variation in temperature. Field observations and recordings of captive individuals indicated that males engaged in both antiphonal calling and call overlap with nearby calling neighbors. We discuss our findings in relation to previous work on vocal behavior in other fossorial frogs and in sooglossid frogs."

To identify electric remodeling of hypertrophic smooth muscles in partially obstructed murine small intestine, the patch-clamp and intracellular microelectrode recording methods were used to identify the possible electric remodeling and Western blot, immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation were utilized to examine the channel protein expression and phosphorylation level changes in this research. After 14 days of obstruction, partial obstruction caused obvious smooth muscle hypertrophy in the proximally located intestine. The slow waves of intestinal smooth muscles in the dilated region were significantly suppressed, their amplitude and frequency were reduced, whilst the resting membrane potentials were depolarized compared with normal and sham animals. The current density of voltage dependent potassium channel (KV) was significantly decreased in the hypertrophic smooth muscle cells and the voltage sensitivity of KV activation was altered. The sensitivity of KV currents (IKV) to TEA, a nonselective potassium channel blocker, increased significantly, but the sensitivity of IKv to 4-AP, a KV blocker, stays the same. The protein levels of KV4.3 and KV2.2 were up-regulated in the hypertrophic smooth muscle cell membrane. The serine and threonine phosphorylation levels of KV4.3 and KV2.2 were significantly increased in the hypertrophic smooth muscle cells. Thus this study represents the first identification of KV channel remodeling in murine small intestinal smooth muscle hypertrophy induced by partial obstruction. The enhanced phosphorylations of KV4.3 and KV2.2 may be involved in this process."
https://openalex.org/W2150553917,"Secondary forests cover large areas of the tropics and play an important role in the global carbon cycle. During secondary forest succession, simultaneous changes occur among stand structural attributes, soil properties, and species composition. Most studies classify tree species into categories based on their regeneration requirements. We use a high-resolution secondary forest chronosequence to assign trees to a continuous gradient in species successional status assigned according to their distribution across the chronosequence. Species successional status, not stand age or differences in stand structure or soil properties, was found to be the best predictor of leaf trait variation. Foliar δ(13)C had a significant positive relationship with species successional status, indicating changes in foliar physiology related to growth and competitive strategy, but was not correlated with stand age, whereas soil δ(13)C dynamics were largely constrained by plant species composition. Foliar δ(15)N had a significant negative correlation with both stand age and species successional status, - most likely resulting from a large initial biomass-burning enrichment in soil (15)N and (13)C and not closure of the nitrogen cycle. Foliar %C was neither correlated with stand age nor species successional status but was found to display significant phylogenetic signal. Results from this study are relevant to understanding the dynamics of tree species growth and competition during forest succession and highlight possibilities of, and potentially confounding signals affecting, the utility of leaf traits to understand community and species dynamics during secondary forest succession."
https://openalex.org/W2126121683,"3-Methyladenine DNA glycosylase recognizes and excises a wide range of damaged bases and thus plays a critical role in base excision repair. However, knowledge on the regulation of DNA glycosylase in prokaryotes and eukaryotes is limited. In this study, we successfully characterized a TetR family transcriptional factor from Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), namely BCG0878c, which directly regulates the expression of 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase (designated as MbAAG) and influences the base excision activity of this glycosylase at the post-translational level. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assay and DNase I footprinting experiments, we identified two conserved motifs within the upstream region of mbaag specifically recognized by BCG0878c. Significant down-regulation of mbaag was observed in BCG0878c-overexpressed M. bovis BCG strains. By contrast, about 12-fold up-regulation of mbaag expression was found in bcg0878c-deleted mutant M. bovis BCG strains. β-Galactosidase activity assays also confirmed these results. Thus, BCG0878c can function as a negative regulator of mbaag expression. In addition, the regulator was shown to physically interact with MbAAG to enhance the ability of the glycosylase to bind damaged DNA. Interaction between the two proteins was further found to facilitate AAG-catalyzed removal of hypoxanthine from DNA. These results indicate that a TetR family protein can dually regulate the function of 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase in M. bovis BCG both at the transcriptional and post-translational levels. These findings enhance our understanding of the expression and regulation of AAG in mycobacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2073303257,"Motivation The discovery that copy number variants (CNVs) are widespread in the human genome has motivated development of numerous algorithms that attempt to detect CNVs from intensity data. However, all approaches are plagued by high false discovery rates. Further, because CNVs are characterized by two dimensions (length and intensity) it is unclear how to order called CNVs to prioritize experimental validation. Results We developed a univariate score that correlates with the likelihood that a CNV is true. This score can be used to order CNV calls in such a way that calls having larger scores are more likely to overlap a true CNV. We developed cnv.beast, a computationally efficient algorithm for calling CNVs that uses robust backward elimination regression to keep CNV calls with scores that exceed a user-defined threshold. Using an independent dataset that was measured using a different platform, we validated our score and showed that our approach performed better than six other currently-available methods. Availability cnv.beast is available at http://www.duke.edu/~asallen/Software.html."
