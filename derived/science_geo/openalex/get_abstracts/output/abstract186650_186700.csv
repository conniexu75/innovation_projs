https://openalex.org/W2114692337,"Molecular conductance junctions are structures in which single molecules or small groups of molecules conduct electrical current between two electrodes. In such junctions, the connection between the molecule and the electrodes greatly affects the current-voltage characteristics. Despite several experimental and theoretical advances, including the understanding of simple systems, there is still limited correspondence between experimental and theoretical studies of these systems."
https://openalex.org/W2015622350,"The use of semiconductor nanocrystals (quantum dots) as fluorescent labels for multiphoton microscopy enables multicolor imaging in demanding biological environments such as living tissue. We characterized water-soluble cadmium selenide–zinc sulfide quantum dots for multiphoton imaging in live animals. These fluorescent probes have two-photon action cross sections as high as 47,000 Goeppert-Mayer units, by far the largest of any label used in multiphoton microscopy. We visualized quantum dots dynamically through the skin of living mice, in capillaries hundreds of micrometers deep. We found no evidence of blinking (fluorescence intermittency) in solution on nanosecond to millisecond time scales."

Consequently, most selenoprotein genes are misannotated. We identified selenoprotein genes in sequenced mammalian genomes by methods that rely on identification of selenocysteine insertion RNA structures, the coding potential of UGA codons, and the presence of cysteine-containing homologs. The human selenoproteome consists of 25 selenoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1994975655,"Helicobacter pylori translocates the protein CagA into gastric epithelial cells and has been linked to peptic ulcer disease and gastric carcinoma. We show that injected CagA associates with the epithelial tight-junction scaffolding protein ZO-1 and the transmembrane protein junctional adhesion molecule, causing an ectopic assembly of tight-junction components at sites of bacterial attachment, and altering the composition and function of the apical-junctional complex. Long-term CagA delivery to polarized epithelia caused a disruption of the epithelial barrier function and dysplastic alterations in epithelial cell morphology. CagA appears to target H. pylori to host cell intercellular junctions and to disrupt junction-mediated functions."
https://openalex.org/W2162152219,"The evolutionary significance of stress-induced mutagenesis was evaluated by studying mutagenesis in aging colonies (MAC) of Escherichia coli natural isolates. A large fraction of isolates exhibited a strong MAC, and the high MAC variability reflected the diversity of selective pressures in ecological niches. MAC depends on starvation, oxygen, and RpoS and adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate regulons; thus it may be a by-product of genetic strategies for improving survival under stress. MAC could also be selected through beneficial mutations that it generates, as shown by computer modeling and the patterns of stress-inducible and constitutive mutagenesis. We suggest that irrespective of the causes of their emergence, stress-induced mutations participate in adaptive evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2138220389,"Malondialdehyde (MDA) is an endogenous genotoxic product of enzymatic and oxygen radical-induced lipid peroxidation whose adducts are known to exist in DNA isolated from healthy human beings. To evaluate the mutagenic potential of MDA in human cells, we reacted MDA with pSP189 shuttle vector DNA and then transfected them into human fibroblasts for replication. MDA induced up to a 15-fold increase in mutation frequency in the supF reporter gene compared with untreated DNA. Sequence analysis revealed that the majority of MDA-induced mutations occurred at GC base pairs. The most frequent mutations were large insertions and deletions, but base pair substitutions were also detected. MDA-induced mutations were completely abolished when the adducted shuttle vector was replicated in cells lacking nucleotide excision repair. MDA induction of large deletions and the apparent requirement for nucleotide excision repair suggested the possible involvement of a DNA interstrand cross-link as a premutagenic lesion. Indeed, MDA formed interstrand cross-links in duplex plasmids and oligonucleotides. Substrates containing the sequence 5′-d(CG) were preferentially cross-linked, consistent with the observation of base pair substitutions in 5′-d(CG) sites in the MDA-induced mutation spectrum. These experiments provide biological and biochemical evidence for the existence of MDA-induced DNA interstrand cross-links that could result from endogenous oxidative stress and likely have potent biological effects.

Cancer results from the accumulation of multiple mutations in key growth regulatory genes (1Fearon E.R. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1990; 61: 759-767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10032) Google Scholar). These genetic changes are a consequence of the inherent chemical instability of DNA under physiological conditions, errors made by the DNA replication and maintenance machinery, and replication of DNA bases that are chemically modified as a result of exposure to exogenous or endogenous genotoxins (2Lindahl T.

Replication of phage genomes containing a site-specifically positioned M1G lesion in E. coli causes a significant increase in mutation frequency compared with unadducted phage DNA (24Fink S.P. Reddy G.R. Marnett L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8652-8657Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The mutation frequency is increased ∼3-fold if the bacteria replicating the lesion are nucleotide excision repair (NER)-deficient (24Fink S.P. Reddy G.R. Marnett L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8652-8657Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Thus the major MDA-DNA adduct, M1G, is 1) found in human tissues, 2) is mutagenic in bacteria, and 3) is a substrate for NER. An important unanswered question is: is MDA mutagenic in human cells? To address this question, we employed a random mutagenesis approach that has been utilized successfully to evaluate the genotoxicity of a number of chemical agents (25Parris C.N. Seidman M.M. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 117: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The double-stranded shuttle vector, pSP189, was reacted with MDA under physiological conditions and then transformed into human cells for replication. MDA was found to induce mutations in this system demonstrating for the first time that this metabolic product is a human mutagen. Subsequent studies suggested the involvement of a previously uncharacterized lesion, an MDA-DNA interstrand cross-link (ICL). Cells and Plasmids—The pSP189 shuttle vector (25Parris C.N. Seidman M.M. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 117: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), as well as the indicator bacteria, MBM7070, were provided by Michael Seidman (NIA, National Institutes of Health). The transformed human embryonic kidney cell line, Ad293 (American Type Culture Collection), was cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), vitamins, and amino acids. The wild-type GM00637F and NER-deficient XP12Be (Coriel Cell Repository) and XP12RO (James Cleaver, University of California, San Francisco) human fibroblasts are SV40-transformed and express the large T antigen. Both NER-deficient cell lines were originally derived from patients with xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group A and have less than 2% of normal UV repair (26Cleaver J.E. Cortes F. Lutze L.H. Morgan W.F. Player A.N. Mitchell D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3353-3357Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). All cell cultures were found negative for mycoplasma by reverse transcriptase-PCR (Stratagene) two passages prior to experimentation. Modification of pSP189 DNA—The pSP189 vector was amplified from a recA – strain of E. coli, AB2463 (Genetic Stock Center, Yale University, New Haven, CT). Plasmid DNA was purified from the bacteria by alkaline lysis followed by cesium chloride banding (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 2 Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Na+-MDA was synthesized as described previously and dissolved in 125 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The concentration was determined spectroscopically (ϵ267 = 34,200 m–1 cm–1) (28Marnett L.J. Bienkowski M.J. Raban M. Tuttle M.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 99: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Varying amounts of MDA were reacted with pSP189 DNA (0.5 mg/ml in 125 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) for 24 h at 37 °C. Then the DNA was purified from soluble MDA using Centricon 3 centrifugal concentrators (Amicon), washed with 10 volumes of water, and concentrated by ethanol precipitation. A fraction of each pellet was examined by agarose gel electrophoresis to determine the extent of nicking caused by modification. Quantification of M 1 G Levels—M1G levels were determined in MDA-treated plasmid DNA using gas chromatography/electron capture/negative chemical ionization/mass spectrometry (GC/EC/NCI/MS) by a modification of procedures described previously (29Rouzer C.A. Chaudhary A.K. Nokubo M. Ferguson D.M. Reddy G.R. Blair I.A. Marnett L.J. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In brief, [2H2]M1G-deoxyribose (M1G-dR) internal standard was added to the MDA-modified pSP189. The DNA was hydrolyzed enzymatically and then purified of protein using an Ultrafree-Probind 0.45-μm filter (Millipore). An aliquot of the digested material was examined by reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography to quantify the DNA by comparison with known concentrations of authentic nucleoside standards. The remainder of the sample was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography using a monoclonal antibody to M1G coupled to Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) (30Sevilla C.L. Mahle N.H. Eliezer N. Uzieblo A. O'Hara S.M. Nokubo M. Miller R. Rouzer C.A. Marnett L.J. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The M1GdR was eluted with methanol, dried, and then hydrolyzed to the base with 2.5% formic acid. The products were neutralized with 2 mm K2CO3 and reacted with 5% α-bromo-2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorotoluene (Aldrich). The derivatized M1G was purified over 100 mg of silica (Supelclean LC-Si, Supelco), and the eluates were evaporated to dryness and redissolved in methanol. Analysis was performed by GC/EC/NCI/MS on a Hewlett-Packard MS Engine (HP5989A) equipped with a series II Plus gas chromatograph (HP5890). Quantities of M1G were determined from the ratio of the heights of the M1G-PFB peak to the [2H2]M1G-PFB peak as related to a standard curve. Transfection and Rescue of pSP189 —Human cells were transfected with modified or unmodified pSP189 by calcium phosphate coprecipitation (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 2 Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). After 48 h, the cells were lysed, and the plasmid DNA was isolated by the Hirt method (31Hirt B. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 26: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (3351) Google Scholar). The recovered DNA was digested with DpnI to remove unreplicated plasmid prior to transformation or by DpnI plus MboI to demonstrate completeness of DpnI digestion. Detection of Mutations—DNA recovered from the human cells was used to transform MBM7070 E. coli by electroporation (2.5 kV, 200 microfarads, 25 ohms, 0.2-cm electrode gap; Bio-Rad GenePulser) and selected on Luria-Bertani broth agar plates containing ampicillin (50 mg/ml). Mutations in the supF reporter gene of pSP189 were screened for by the addition of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside (X-gal, Gold Biotechnology, Inc.) (60 mg/liter) and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG) (15 mg/liter) to the plates. The supF gene encodes a suppressor tRNA which permits bypass of an amber mutation in lacZ of the MBM7070 genome, thereby allowing expression of β-galactosidase. Transformants with a wild-type copy of supF, in the presence of the inducer IPTG and substrate X-gal, produce blue colonies. Bacteria that receive a copy of pSP189 with a mutation in supF remain lacZ – and therefore, white. The mutation frequency is reported as the number of white colonies divided by the total number of colonies screened. Over 105 bacterial colonies, accumulated from three independent experiments, were screened for mutants for each concentration of MDA tested. Mutation Assay in SOS-induced E. coli—A 50-ml culture of MBM7070 was grown to mid-log phase, harvested by centrifugation, and the pellet resuspended in an equal volume of 10 mm MgSO4. The MBM7070 suspension was SOS-induced by UV irradiation for 2.5 min with a hand-held 254 nm lamp corresponding to a dose of 120 J/m2 resulting in 10% survival. Following irradiation, the bacteria were allowed to recover in SOC media for 30 min in the dark. Bacteria were pelleted and then washed twice with 10% glycerol at 4 °C. Aliquots were transformed with modified pSP189 by electroporation and scored for mutants as described above. Characterization of the Mutations—Mutant colonies were picked, grown overnight in a 5-ml culture of LB containing ampicillin and tetracycline, and then restreaked twice on selective plates containing X-gal and IPTG to confirm their phenotype. Plasmid DNA was amplified and isolated by alkaline lysis. A fraction of each DNA preparation was linearized with EcoRI and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis for alterations in DNA mobility indicative of large insertions or deletions. Mutant DNA was sequenced by thermal cycling (Circumvent Sequencing Kit, New England Biolabs) using the primer oligonucleotide 5′-d(GGCGACACGGAAATGTTGAA), which was 5′-32P-end-labeled. Twenty cycles of amplification were required (94 °C for 1 min; 57 °C for 1 min; 72 °C for 1 min). Reactions were run on an 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel (dPAGE; National Diagnostics) and visualized by autoradiography. Sibling mutants were identified as any pair of mutant DNA that arose from the same MDA-modification reaction and human cell transfection that exhibited the identical mutations and signature sequences and scored only once in the mutational analysis (25Parris C.N. Seidman M.M. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 117: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Plasmid Assay for DNA ICLs—The assay was adapted from the procedure of Hartley et al. (32Hartley J.A. Berardini M.D. Souhami R.L. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 193: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In brief, plasmid pBR322 DNA (40 μg) was linearized with EcoRI, dephosphorylated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase, and then 5′-32P-end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase. Enzyme and excess ATP were removed by phenol extraction and Biospin-6 chromatography (Bio-Rad), respectively. MDA was reacted with DNA (33,000 cpm) in MOPS buffer (125 mm, pH 7.0) for 24 h at 37 °C in a total volume of 25 μl. The samples were heat-denatured at 90 °C for 5 min in the presence of 2.5 μl of strand separation buffer (0.04% bromphenol blue, 0.04% xylene cyanol, 30% Me2SO, 1 mm EDTA) and then rapidly cooled on ice. The denatured single-stranded DNA was separated from non-denatured double-stranded DNA by agarose gel electrophoresis. The gel was dried, and radioactive bands were visualized by PhosphorImager analysis (Amersham Biosciences). Non-denatured linear pBR322 diluted in 15% Ficoll loading buffer was used as a marker of duplex DNA. Oligonucleotide Assay for DNA ICLs—One hundred pmol of dPAGE-purified oligonucleotide 5′-d(CGCGCGGCATG) (Midland) was end-labeled with 32P and repurified as described above. The DNA was dried under vacuum and then resuspended in 20 μl of annealing buffer (10 mm MOPS, pH 7.4 and 6 mm MgCl2) with an equimolar amount of the unlabeled complementary oligonucleotide. The oligonucleotides were annealed by heating at 90 °C for 5 min followed by a slow cool to room temperature. Aliquots of the duplex were modified with 150 mm Na+-MDA (in H2O) or 25 mm β-benzoyloxyacrolein (BBA) (in Me2SO, synthesized as described previously (33Kalinina N.N. Klimko V.T. Protopopova T.V. Skoldinov A.P. Zh. Obshch. Khim. 1962; 32: 2146-2151Google Scholar)) in 125 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at 25 °C for 24 h in a total volume of 20 μl. Alternatively, aliquots of the duplex were modified for3hwith1mm melphalan (in 0.1 n HCl, Sigma), 1 mm mechlorethamine (in 0.1 n HCl, Sigma), or for 1 h with 1 mm N-acetoxy-2-acetyl-aminofluorene (N-AAAF) (in ethanol, NCI Chemical Reference Standard Repositories). Reactions were stopped by the addition of loading dye and loaded directly onto a 20% dPAGE. Sequence Specificity of MDA-DNA ICLs—Six possible nucleoside pairs were screened for MDA cross-linking: G-G, C-C, A-A, G-C, G-A, and C-A in both the 3′ → 5′ and 5′ → 3′ orientation. The pairs were centered, for the most part uniquely, in a series of 10 synthetic oligonucleotide duplexes. The sequences flanking the target sequence contained only AT base pairs to minimize alternative modification sites. The oligonucleotides were 18 bp in length to increase the T m to above room temperature. Inosine was used in place of guanosine wherever possible in order to minimize the number of reactive exocyclic amino groups. The oligonucleotide duplexes shown in Fig. 2 were synthesized. MDA Modification of Plasmid DNA—Double-stranded pSP189 DNA was reacted with a range of concentrations of MDA at physiological temperature and pH (37 °C, pH 7.4, sodium phosphate buffer). Modification was evaluated by determining the levels of M1G in the shuttle vector DNA by GC/EC/NCI/MS. M1G concentrations increased linearly (R = 0.99) with increasing amounts of MDA (Fig. 3A). The range of adduct levels detected corresponds to 0.01 to 0.10 m1G per shuttle vector in the samples used for mutagenesis. Mutation Frequency Induced by MDA in Human Cells— Unmodified or MDA-modified pSP189 was transiently transfected into Ad293 human kidney cells. After ∼2 doubling times, the plasmid was recovered from the cells, transformed into an indicator bacterium, and screened for mutations in the supF reporter gene using a β-galactosidase α-complementation assay. The background mutation frequency in supF from unmodified pSP189 replicated in Ad293 cells was 1.3 × 10–4 which is comparable with published values (34Mah M.C.M. Boldt J. Culp S.J. Maher V.M. McCormick J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10193-10197Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 35Yang J.-L. Maher V.M. McCormick J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3787-3791Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). MDA induced a dose-responsive increase in the mutation frequency ranging from 4.8 to 20 × 10–4 (Fig. 3B). The mutation frequency increased sharply at low concentrations of MDA (0.5–5 mm) and then plateaued or increased only slightly above 25 mm MDA to a maximum of 15-fold above background. At the lowest concentration of MDA tested, the mutation frequency was significantly greater than background (4.8 × 10–4 versus 1.3 × 10–4). Evaluation of lower concentrations of MDA (10 and 100 μm) revealed a 1.9- and 2.1-fold increase in mutation frequency, respectively (data not shown). Several controls were performed to confirm that the mutations observed were a consequence of replication of MDA-induced DNA adducts in human cells. First, because nicks are premutagenic lesions (36Seidman M.M. Bredberg A. Seetharam S. Kraemer K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4944-4948Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), we confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis that exposure of double-stranded pSP189 DNA to MDA did not induce nicking (data not shown). Second, pSP189 vector DNA recovered from the human cells was digested with DpnI prior to transformation of bacteria to remove all DNA that was not replicated by the human cells. Sequential digestion of rescued pSP189 with DpnI and MboI (the latter of which cuts only DNA replicated by mammalian cells) reduced the number of bacterial transformants by >99.5% indicating that DpnI digestion efficiently removed unreplicated DNA. Finally, MDA-modified pSP189 was transformed directly into MBM7070 bacterium and found to be non-mutagenic unless the bacteria were SOS-induced with UV irradiation prior to transformation (Fig. 3C). Because non-induced MBM7070 was used for detection of mutations in pSP189 harvested from human cells, this experiment demonstrated that the MDA-induced mutations were not generated in the bacteria during the screen. Characterization of MDA-induced Mutations—A total of 12 spontaneous and 207 MDA-induced mutant plasmids were amplified, and the supF gene was sequenced. A fraction of each mutant plasmid was linearized by EcoRI digestion and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis for a shift in mobility indicative of a large insertion or deletion. One of the spontaneous mutants and 36% of the MDA-induced mutants exhibited such a mobility shift (data not shown). Six percent of the MDA-induced mutants carried multiple mutations within the supF gene. The occurrence of multiple mutations increased with the concentration of MDA used. The classes of mutations induced by MDA did not vary at different concentrations of MDA. Four of the twelve spontaneous mutants sequenced contained a unique mutation within the 250 bp surrounding the 85-bp supF coding sequence (Table I). These included 1 insertion, 1 deletion, and 2 base substitutions. MDA induced predominantly insertions and deletions (63% of all mutations). Large deletions were most frequent (40% of all mutations); however, large insertions also were observed (16% of all mutations). Small insertions and deletions (≤2 bp) were less common; the most frequent were 2-base deletions (3%). Base substitutions comprised 37% of all MDA-induced mutations, the majority of which were at GC base pairs (92% of all substitutions).

Open table in a new tab Positioning of the MDA-induced base substitutions along the supF sequence (Fig. 4) demonstrated that the mutations were spread throughout the reporter gene. There was only one mutational hot spot (defined as >5% of observed mutations at a single base pair) at position 36. This hot spot was unusual in that all three of the possible base substitutions were observed with approximately equal frequency. Position 36 does not correlate with a previously reported hot spot for spontaneous mutations in the supF gene (37Hauser J. Seidman M.M. Sidur K. Dixon K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 38Moraes E.C. Keyse S.M. Tyrrell R.M. Carcinogenesis. 1990; 11: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), but it is a hot spot for UV-(25) and ionizing radiation-induced mutations (39Jaberaboansari A. Dunn W.C. Preston R.J. Mitra S. Waters L.C. Radiat. Res. 1991; 127: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Mutation Frequency Induced by MDA in NER-deficient Fibroblasts—Double-stranded DNA containing M1G is a substrate for bacterial NER (24Fink S.P. Reddy G.R. Marnett L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8652-8657Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Thus, we investigated the ability of MDA-modified pSP189 to induce mutations in human cell lines derived from a patient with xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group A (XP-A). We anticipated that higher mutation frequencies would be observed in the NER-deficient cells compared with repair-competent cells. Contrary to expectations, replication of MDA-modified pSP189 resulted in a complete abrogation of mutagenesis (Fig. 3B). To rule out the possibility that this result was due to a difference between the cell lines other than their DNA repair capacity (e.g. tissue source or mechanism of immortalization), the assay was repeated using another set of wild-type and XP-A-deficient fibroblast lines that are both SV40-transformed (26Cleaver J.E. Cortes F. Lutze L.H. Morgan W.F. Player A.N. Mitchell D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3353-3357Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The same results were obtained, i.e. MDA was unable to induce an increase in mutation frequency above background levels in the absence of NER (data not shown). To rule out the possibility that this unexpected result was due to a highly genotoxic contaminant in the synthetic MDA, a structural analog of MDA, BBA (Fig. 1), was also tested in the mutation assay. BBA is synthesized by a different mechanism than MDA (33Kalinina N.N. Klimko V.T. Protopopova T.V. Skoldinov A.P. Zh. Obshch. Khim. 1962; 32: 2146-2151Google Scholar), and thus it is unlikely to contain similar putative contaminations. BBA was ∼8-fold more mutagenic than MDA (data not shown) consistent with its increased reactivity with DNA under neutral conditions (40Basu A.K. Marnett L.J. Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 2848-2854PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to MDA, however, BBA-induced mutagenesis was NER-dependent. In Vitro Assay to Detect DNA ICLs—Because a mutation spectrum dominated by large rearrangements and the dependence of mutagenesis on functional NER are both consistent with a DNA ICL as a premutagenic lesion, we tested the ability of MDA to form such lesions in vitro. First, linear end-labeled pBR322 plasmid was reacted with MDA under conditions that mimicked the modification of pSP189 DNA. After 24 h at 37 °C, the DNA was heat-denatured and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis for the presence of non-denaturable double-stranded DNA (Fig. 5A). Unreacted DNA was completely denatured to single strands (Fig. 5A, 2nd lane), whereas treatment of the plasmid with 25 mm MDA rendered ∼10% of the sample non-denaturable (Fig. 5A, 4th lane) consistent with the rapid renaturation characteristic of cross-linked DNA. At 50 mm MDA, virtually all of the DNA appeared to be cross-linked. Similarly, a duplex 32P-end-labeled oligonucleotide was reacted with MDA in vitro under conditions identical to those used for plasmid modification. An 11-bp, GC-rich sequence was chosen in accord with the mutation spectrum of MDA in which there was a preponderance of mutations at GC base pairs. The reactions were loaded directly onto a denaturing PAGE gel for separation o"

We report that these deficits are restricted to discontinuous movements. Cerebellar patients exhibited no deficit in temporal variability when producing continuous, rhythmic movements. We hypothesize that the temporal properties of continuous movements are emergent and reflect the operation of other control parameters not associated with the cerebellum. In contrast, discontinuous movements require an explicit representation of the temporal goal, a function of the cerebellum. The requirement for explicit temporal representation provides a parsimonious account of cerebellar involvement in a range of tasks."
https://openalex.org/W2026320244,"Atomic imaging of three-dimensional structures has required a crystal in diffraction or a lens in electron imaging. Whereas diffraction achieves very high resolution by averaging over many cells, imaging gives localized structural information, such as the position of a single dopant atom. However, lens aberrations limit electron imaging resolution to about 1 angstrom. Resolution is reduced further by low contrast from weakscattering or from the limitations on electron dose for radiation-sensitive molecules. We show that both high resolution and high contrast can be achieved by imaging from diffraction with a nanometer-sized coherent electron beam. The phase problem is solved by oversampling and iterative phase retrieval. We apply this technique to image a double-wall carbon nanotube at 1-angstrom resolution, revealing the structure of two tubes of different helicities. Because the only requirement for imaging is a diffraction pattern sampled below the Nyquist frequency, our technique has the potential to image nonperiodic nanostructures, including biological macromolecules, at diffraction intensity–limited resolutions."
https://openalex.org/W2013154277,"Stochastic on-off conductivity switching observed in phenylene-ethynylene oligomers has been explained in terms of changes in ring conformations, or electron localization, or both. We report the observation of stochastic on-off switching in the simplest of wired molecules: octanedithiol, decanedithiol, and dodecanedithiol bonded on an Au(111) surface. Stochastic switching was observed even when a top gold contact was pressed on by a conducting atomic force microscope tip at constant force. The rate of switching increased substantially at 60 degrees C, a temperature at which these films are commonly annealed. Because such switching in alkanethiols is unlikely to be caused by internal molecular electronic changes and cannot be fully accounted for by breaking of the top contact, we argue that the cause is the well-known mobility of molecules tethered to gold via a thiol linkage."

The homeobox gene GLABRA2 (GL2) has been considered a key component, acting farthest downstream in this regulation. GL2 modified to include a transactivating function caused epidermal cells to develop ectopic root hairs or root hair-like structures. With this system, the phospholipase Dzeta1 gene (AtPLDzeta1) was identified as a direct target of GL2. Inducible expression of AtPLDzeta1 promoted ectopic root-hair initiation. We conclude that GL2 exerts its regulatory effect on root-hair development through modulation of phospholipid signaling."

Here we analyze whether PDX-1 functions as a pancreatic differentiation factor and a bona fide master regulator when ectopically expressed in mature fully differentiated liver in vivo. By ectopic and transient PDX-1 expression in liver in vivo, using the first generation recombinant adenoviruses, we demonstrate that PDX-1 induces in liver a wide repertoire of both exocrine and endocrine pancreatic gene expression. Moreover, PDX-1 induces its own expression (auto-induction), which in turn may explain the long lasting nature of the “liver to pancreas” transdifferentiation. Insulin as well glucagon-producing cells are mainly located in the proximity of hepatic central veins, possibly allowing direct hormone release into the bloodstream, without affecting normal hepatic function. Importantly, we demonstrate that hepatic insulin production triggered by Ad-CMV-PDX-1 recombinant adenovirus administration is functional and prevents streptozotocin-induced hyperglycemia in Balb/c mice even 8 months after the initial treatment. We conclude that PDX-1 plays an important instructive role in pancreas differentiation, not only from primitive gut endoderm but also from mature liver.

Transconversion of liver to pancreas may serve as a novel approach for generating endocrine-pancreatic tissue that can replace malfunctioning β-cells in diabetics. The possible role of “master regulator” transcription factors in directing cell fate, taken together with the documented plasticity of many mature tissues and pluripotent cells, motivated us to analyze whether it is possible to redirect the developmental route of cells in liver toward a pancreatic β-cell phenotype. The strategy used for this purpose is ectopic expression of a specific pancreatic master regulator gene. Our hypothesis was that such a developmental redirection was most likely to occur between tissues that are developmentally related, such as liver and pancreas (1Ferber S. Halkin A. Cohen H. Ber I.

During organogenesis PDX-1 is expressed in all cells differentiating toward the exocrine and endocrine components of the pancreas (11Hui H. Perfetti R. Eur. J.

PDX-1 is neither expressed in glucagon producing α-cells nor in mature exocrine pancreas (11Hui H. Perfetti R. Eur. J.

Diabetologia. 2001; 44: 1203-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). We demonstrated previously that transdifferentiation of liver to pancreas could be induced by ectopic expression of PDX-1; expression of PDX-1 in liver induced expression of the otherwise silent endogenous insulin genes and was sufficient to direct the production and secretion of mature, biologically active insulin from a restricted population of cells in the liver in vivo. Furthermore, insulin secreted from liver of PDX-1-treated mice ameliorated streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes (1Ferber S. Halkin A. Cohen H. Ber I. Einav Y. Goldberg I. Barshack I. Seijffers R. Kopolovic J. Kaiser N. Karasik A. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 568-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). In the present study PDX-1 cDNA is delivered in vivo by systemic administration of recombinant adenoviruses that carry the rat PDX-1 gene under the cytomegalovirus promoter (Ad-CMV-PDX-1). This gene delivery system results in efficient transgene expression, mainly in the liver (15Varda-Bloom N. Shaish A. Gonen A. Levanon K. Greenbereger S. Ferber S. Levkovitz H. Castel D. Goldberg I. Afek A. Kopolovitc Y. Harats D. Gene Ther. 2001; 8: 819-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Because genes delivered in vivo by recombinant adenoviruses do not integrate into the host genome, ectopic expression is transient, lasting from days to a few weeks (15Varda-Bloom N. Shaish A.

Therefore, our previous study monitored the effects of the ectopic PDX-1 over a short period (up to 2 weeks), to parallel the predicted time frame of the PDX-1 transgene expression (1Ferber S. Halkin A. Cohen H. Ber I. Einav Y. Goldberg I. Barshack I. Seijffers R. Kopolovic J. Kaiser N. Karasik A. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 568-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). In order to determine whether PDX-1 fulfills the role of a differentiation factor in mature hepatic tissues, we sought to determine whether it induces, in addition to insulin, a broad repertoire of pancreatic markers, especially these that are not considered its immediate targets. Moreover, if indeed PDX-1 acts as a differentiation factor also in mature liver and not only in the primitive gut endoderm, then it may trigger a cascade of events that do not require continuous expression of the transgene. Therefore, we sought to determine whether the transient ectopic PDX-1 induces a long lasting process of liver to pancreas transconversion. Moreover, bona fide master regulators such as MyoD have the capacity to activate their own expression (18Weintraub H. Tapscott S.J. Davis R.L. Thayer M.J. Adam M.A. Lassar A.B. Miller A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5434-5438Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). This has been proven also for PDX-1 but only in pancreatic β-cells (19Ben-Shushan E. Marshak S. Shoshkes M.

Because additional transcription factors such as hepatic nuclear factor 1α and 3β that are known to control PDX-1 expression in pancreatic β-cells are also expressed in liver and could cooperate with the PDX-1 transgene, we sought to analyze whether the endogenous otherwise silent homologue of PDX-1 is induced also in liver in response to the transgene expression, thus in turn directing a long lasting process of liver to pancreas transdifferentiation, also when the transgene is no longer expressed. The present study analyzes PDX-1 capacity to function as a pancreatic differentiation factor in mature liver and investigates part of the mechanism of liver to pancreas transconversion. Moreover, it examines whether the PDX-1-induced liver to pancreas transdifferentiation process carries a therapeutic benefit long after the initial ectopic PDX-1 gene expression decays. Recombinant Adenoviruses—Ad-CMV-PDX-1 was constructed as described previously (1Ferber S. Halkin A. Cohen H. Ber I. Einav Y. Goldberg I. Barshack I. Seijffers R. Kopolovic J. Kaiser N. Karasik A.

Ad-CMV-β-galactosidase (generously contributed by C. B. Newgard) serves as a control for nonspecific effect of adenovirus-mediated gene delivery. Cell Culture—The mouse pancreatic derived cell lines β-TC-1 and α-TC-1 and the rat pancreatic cell line RIN1046-38 were cultured according to conditions published previously (21Seijffers R.

Animals and Recombinant Adenoviruses—Mice were housed in an air-conditioned environment, under a 12-h light/dark cycle, and handled according to institutional animal welfare regulations. 8–9-week-old (18–19 g) BALB/c mice were treated by 1–5 × 1010 plaque-forming units of the indicated recombinant adenoviruses by systemic injection into the tail vein (in a volume of 200–300 μl of physiological saline). Blood was drawn from the tail, for determination of glucose concentration (Accutrend® GC, Roche Applied Science). Liver was harvested for immunohistochemical staining (fixed in 4% formaldehyde and embedded in paraffin), for analysis of gene expression (total RNA), and for determination of pancreatic hormone content in liver. For the last two analyses, hepatic specimens were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –70 °C. RNA Isolation and RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from frozen tissues using Tri-Reagent (Molecular Research Center). RNA samples were treated by 10 units of RQ1 RNase-free DNase I (Promega) for 60 min. cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription (native avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, Chimerx) by using 4 μg of DNA-free total RNA and 0.5 μg of oligo(dT)15. PCR was performed using T3 Thermocycler (Biometra, Göttingen, Germany), and products were separated on 1.8% agarose gels and visualized with ethidium bromide. The sequence of the primers used for PCR and reactions conditions were as listed in Table I. Note that in order to discriminate between expression of the endogenous mouse PDX-1 and the ectopic rat homologue, two sets of specific oligonucleotide primers were designed (see Table I). RNA isolated from the β-TC-1 cell line was used as a control for insulin and somatostatin genes expression, and the α-TC-1 cell line was used for glucagon.Table IPrimer sequences and PCR conditionsGenePrimer sequencesCDNAProductAnnealingCycles°Csμlbpβ-ActinF, ATGGATGACGATATCGCT1570564535R, ATGAGGTAGTCTGTCAGGTRat PDX-1aSpecific primer to rat PDX-1, no recognition of mouse PDX-1.F, CCAAAACCGTCGCATGAAGTG1628606035R, CAGCTCGCCTGGTGGCTGTMouse PDX-1bSpecific primer to mouse PDX-1, no recognition of rat PDX-1.F, CCTTCGGGCCTTAGCGTGTC3396599038R, CGCCTGCTGGTCCGTATTGInsulin IF, TTGCCCTCTGGGAGCCCAAA125362.66038R, CAGATGCTGGTGCAGCACTGInsulin IIF, TCTTCCTCTGGGAGTCCCAC125962.66036R, CAGATGCTGGTGCAGCACTGSomatostatinF, CAGACTCCGTCAGTTTCTGC3262549038R, ACAGGATGTGAAAGTCTTCCAGlucagonF, ATCATTCCCAGCTTCCCAGA2161526038R, CGGTTCCTCTTGGTGTTCATIAPPF, CCACTTGAGAGCTACACCTG2205546037R, GGATTCCCTATTTGGATCCAd-CMV-PDX-1F, CTCAATGGGAGTTTGTTTTGG1 (DNA)569586026R, GGGGGATTAGCACTGAACTCTElastaseF, GGGCACAAACAGACCATCAC2298556038R, GGGATGGGTAAGAAGGTGGTp48F, GAAGGTTATCATCTGCCATCG3211546038R, GGGTGGTTCGTTCTCTATGTTa Specific primer to rat PDX-1, no recognition of mouse PDX-1.b Specific primer to mouse PDX-1, no recognition of rat PDX-1. Open table in a new tab Quantitative Analysis for Pancreatic Gene Expression Using Real Time PCR—RT-PCR was performed on the LightCycler (Roche Applied Science) using SYBR-Green I dye. Amplification conditions included initial denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 55 cycles for both mouse and rat PDX-1, or 30 cycles for β-actin. For both PDX-1 homologues, each cycle included denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s, annealing at 59 °C, and extension at 72 °C for 15 s. Annealing for β-actin was performed at 56 °C for 10 s. The fluorescent signal was monitored 5 s after each cycle at 90 °C for β-actin, 87 °C for mouse PDX-1, and 88 °C for rat PDX-1. Melting curve program was carried out at 68 °C for 40 s to analyze the specificity of the generated products. The RT-PCR for mouse PDX-1 was performed 3 times and for rat PDX-1 2 times. Both rat and mouse PDX-1 levels were normalized to the respective β-actin mRNA levels in the same samples. Pancreatic Hormones Analysis by Immunohistochemistry—Slides of 4-μm paraffin-embedded sections were deparaffinized and incubated in 3% H2O2 and in blocking solution (for both insulin and glucagon detection), using the commercially available Histomouse™-SP Kit (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA). Sections were then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with monoclonal antibodies against human insulin and against human glucagon (Sigma), both at a dilution of 1:200. Because both insulin and glucagon are detected within the same tissue, at the same time using the same dilution of distinct monoclonal antibodies, they are considered extraneous to each other. Slides were exposed to the secondary biotinylated IgG for 30 min at room temperature and then incubated in streptavidin-peroxidase followed by a chromogen peroxide solution. A control using only secondary antibody without primary antibodies followed by streptavidin-peroxidase and a chromogen peroxide solution was performed to rule out possible background of the system. Radioimmunoassay (RIA) of Pancreatic Hormones—Frozen tissues were homogenized in 0.18 n HCl, 35% ethanol. The homogenates were extracted overnight at 4 °C with continuous stirring, and the supernatants were lyophilized. Samples were dissolved in 0.8 ml of RIA Assay Buffer, supplemented by a mixture of protease inhibitors (Sigma). Hepatic insulin and glucagon levels were determined using rat radioimmunoassay (RIA, catalog numbers SRI-13K and GL-32K, Linco, MO, and Coat-A-Count, Diagnostic Products Corp.). Somatostatin concentrations were determined by RIA (Euro-Diagnostica, Sweden). Hepatic content of pancreatic hormones was normalized to the wet weight of extracted tissues. Analyses of Hepatic Function—Serum biochemistry profile consisting of albumin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and total bilirubin and amylase levels was determined using Olympus AU 2700 Apparatus (Olympus, Germany) in serum samples. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was preformed using Two-sample Assuming Unequal Variances t test. Both Pancreatic Endocrine and Exocrine Markers Are Induced in Liver by Ectopic PDX-1 Expression— Fig. 1 shows that ectopic PDX-1 expression in mature liver in vivo activates a wide repertoire of pancreatic genes. Both endocrine and exocrine markers including the exocrine pancreas transcription factor p48 were uniquely expressed in response to ectopic PDX-1 expression in liver (Fig. 1). Control treated mice were mostly negative to pancreatic gene expression. Although insulin gene expression was induced in close to 100% of mice treated by ectopic PDX-1, it was expressed at very low levels that were not translated into protein also in 20–30% of the control treated mice. In the developing pancreas PDX-1 serves as an early molecular marker that temporally correlates with pancreatic commitment (13Guz Y. Montminy M.R. Stein R. Leonard J. Gamer L.W. Wright C.V.E. Development. 1995; 121: 11-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Ahlgren U. Jonsson J. Edlund H. Development. 1996; 122: 1409-1416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Ahlgren U. Jonsson J. Jonsson L.

Our data suggest that PDX-1 recapitulates to some extent its role in pancreas organogenesis, also in a mature fully differentiated tissue, such as liver. PDX-1 Triggers a Long Lasting Process of Liver to Pancreas Developmental Shift—In order to explore the mechanism underlying the PDX-1-induced developmental shift, and to specifically determine whether cells in liver that ectopically express PDX-1 exhibit several pancreatic developmental options that persist for long periods of time, we carefully followed insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin gene expression and protein production for 6 months after the initial, single adenovirus-mediated PDX-1 administration to mice livers in vivo. 8–9-Week-old mice were treated by systemic injection of Ad-CMV-PDX-1, a recombinant adenovirus that carries the rat PDX-1 gene (STF-1) under the control of the CMV promoter (1Ferber S. Halkin A. Cohen H. Ber I. Einav Y. Goldberg I. Barshack I. Seijffers R. Kopolovic J. Kaiser N. Karasik A. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 568-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Pancreatic gene expression in liver was analyzed in comparison to age-matched control mice (treated by either Ad-CMV-β-galactosidase or untreated). Despite the expected transient PDX-1 expression achieved by adenovirus-mediated delivery of the gene to liver, expression of insulin and somatostatin persisted for 6 months, at both the mRNA (Fig. 2) and protein levels (Fig. 4). Glucagon gene expression was evident during the first 4 months (Figs. 2 and 3). Importantly, insulin I and insulin II genes expression was evident in 80–100% of PDX-1-treated mice even 6–8 months after the initial PDX-1 treatment. The increase in insulin and glucagon expression in PDX-1 versus control treated mice livers was further confirmed using real time PCR (data not presented).Fig. 4Quantitative analysis of hepatic content of pancreatic hormones in PDX-1-treated mice.

Glucagon gene is not a direct PDX-1 target gene, and its persistent expression in liver suggests that PDX-1 is functioning as a differentiation factor in this organ. Quantitative Analysis of Insulin, Glucagon, and Somatostatin Hormones Production in PDX-1-treated Livers as a Function of Time after Initial Ad-CMV-PDX-1 Administration—Our data demonstrate that the pancreatic genes expressed in liver as a consequence of ectopic PDX-1 expression are successfully translated into the respective proteins. Immunohistochemical analysis (Fig. 3) localizes the insulin-producing cells mainly in the proximity of central veins even 4–6 months after PDX-1 ectopic gene delivery (Fig. 3, A and C). Although glucagon-positive cells are also localized in the proximity of central veins (Fig. 3B), immunohistochemical analysis of these two hormones performed on sequential slides suggest that these hormones do not co-localize within the same cell. Liver cells present in areas close to the central vein in liver are known to correspond to mature cells (25Lamers W.H. Vermeulen J.L. Hakvoort T.B. Moorman A.F. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 1507-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Quantitative analysis of hepatic insulin stored in the liver of PDX-1-treated mice indicates that even 4–6 months after treatment, hepatic insulin content is about 30–75 ng/g tissue, compared with 1–9 ng/g tissue in age-matched control livers (Fig. 4A). Although this represents a substantial increase compared with control liver, it is about 1.3–3% of pancreatic content (51280 ng/g tissue), even after we take in consideration that liver is about 20-fold larger than pancreas. A significant 2-fold increase in hepatic pro/glucagon and somatostatin content was observed up to at least 4 months after initial Ad-CMV-PDX-1 administration (Fig. 4, B and C). Despite hepatic insulin production, serum insulin and glucose levels in PDX-1-treated mice bearing normal pancreatic function were normal throughout the duration of the experiment (insulin, 1.0 ± 0.5 versus 0.9 ± 0.4 ng/ml, and glucagon, 0.16 ± 0.08 versus 0.12 ± 0.05 ng/ml in PDX-1-treated compared with controls, respectively). The persistent production of pancreatic hormones in liver suggests that ectopic PDX-1 triggers a cascade of events that may not require the continuous presence of the PDX-1 transgene. Ectopic PDX-1 Triggers the Expression of the Endogenous, Otherwise Silent PDX-1 Gene in Liver; a Possible Mechanism of Sustained Liver to Pancreas Transdifferentiation—In order to explain the sustained developmental shift in liver, triggered by the transient ectopic PDX-1 expression, we analyzed whether the transgene induces the expression of otherwise silent pancreatic transcription factors, which in turn dictate the continuous expression of pancreatic genes. An obvious candidate is the endogenous PDX-1 gene itself. To analyze the induction of the endogenous and otherwise silent PDX-1 gene in liver by the ectopic gene, we treated mice by systemic delivery of recombinant adenovirus that directs expression of the rat PDX-1 homologue, and we used specific oligonucleotide primers to distinguish between the ectopic PDX-1 transgene (rat) mRNA (cDNA) and the endogenous mouse mRNA, by RT-PCR. PCR analysis of DNA samples isolated from liver of Ad-CMV-PDX-1-treated mice confirms that the virally encoded transgene disappears between 30 and 56 days after adenovirus injection (Fig. 5A). Fig. 5B demonstrates that the ectopic rat PDX-1 expression parallels the observed presence of delivered viral DNA in liver and also extinguishes after 1 month (Fig. 5A). The only homologue of PDX-1 expressed in treated livers for the whole duration of the experiment is the endogenous and otherwise silent mouse homologue (Fig. 5B). Endogenous PDX-1 expression was exclusive to mice that received the rat PDX-1 transgene, was evident in 75% of ectopic PDX-1-treated mice (21 of 28 mice), and in none of the 25 control treated livers analyzed. By using real time PCR, we further analyzed the identity and quantities of the relative levels of mouse versus rat PDX-1 gene expression in liver as a function of time after the initial treatment, using identical conditions (but different primers), and we normalized it to β-actin within the same samples. As demonstrated in Fig. 5C, the mRNA encoding the ectopic rat PDX-1 is maximal at 5 days, drops by 85% at day 30, and disappears thereafter. By contrast, the endogenous mouse PDX-1 is expressed at substantial levels for the whole duration of the experiment. Unfortunately, due to the high level of homology between the two nuclear proteins, no specific antibody could distinguish between the rat and the mouse homologues of PDX-1, although it seems highly unlikely that the nuclear protein detected only in mouse livers 2–6 months after the initial adenovirus delivery corresponds to the ectopic transiently expressed transgene (data not presented). These data taken together suggest an auto-induction of the endogenous and otherwise silent PDX-1 in liver, which in turn may suggest a mechanistic explanation for the long lasting mode of liver to pancreas transconversion process. Insulin Produced in Liver in Response to PDX-1 Transgene Expression Is Functional and Prevents STZ-induced Hyperglycemia—In order to determine whether PDX-1 gene delivery induces long lasting production of biologically active insulin, we analyzed whether it provides protection against STZ-induced diabetes, even 8 months after the initial Ad-CMV-PDX-1 administration. Mice were treated by 220 mg/kg STZ, and the incidences of hyperglycemia were compared with those in age-matched controls. Sixty percent of the control BALB/c mice developed hyperglycemia (6 of 10) within 3–5 days of STZ injection. By contrast, only 1 of 5 PDX-1-treated mice developed hyperglycemia in response to STZ treatment (20%). In order to analyze whether hepatic insulin production contributed to such a protection, we analyzed the hepatic and the pancreatic insulin content in PDX-1-treated and control mice. Immunohistochemical studies and insulin content analyses revealed that in response to"

Recently, these long known molecules received a renewed interest due to the fact that PIM2 constitute the anchor motif of an important constituent of the mycobacterial cell wall, the lipoarabinomannans (LAM), and that both LAM (phosphoinositol-capped LAM) and PIM are agonists of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), a pattern recognition receptor involved in innate immunity.

PIM appear to be the common anchor of LM and LAM, as LM correspond to polymannosylated PIM and then give rise to LAM by further glycosylation with arabinosyl units. This anchor plays a fundamental role in the biological functions of LAM. Indeed, it is now clearly established that most of the LAM immunoregulatory effects are abolished by alkaline hydrolysis, highlighting the importance of the lipidic part of the anchor (2Gilleron M.

PIM1, PIM3, PIM4, and PIM5 were observed in very small amounts, suggesting that they are biosynthetic intermediates. PIM are known from the 1940s and have been structurally investigated by Ballou and co-workers in the 1960s (9Lee Y.C. Ballou C.E. Biochemistry. 1965; 4: 1395-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). By 1965, studies of deacylated PIM from M. tuberculosis and Mycobacterium phlei revealed the structure of the saccharidic part. PIM6 were the highest PIM which were fully characterized from M. phlei (10Hill D.L. Ballou C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 895-902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and were shown to contain a pentamannoside of sequence Manpα1→2Manpα1→2Manpα1→6Manpα1→6Manpα1→attached to position 6 of the myo-inositol, whereas a Manp unit is linked to the position 2 of the myo-inositol. Recently, the complete structure of native PIM2 has been achieved (1Gilleron M. Ronet C. Mempel M. Monsarrat B. Gachelin G. Puzo G. J. Biol.

PIM2 were shown to recruit natural killer T cells, which have a primary role in the local granulomatous response (1Gilleron M. Ronet C. Mempel M. Monsarrat B. Gachelin G. Puzo G. J. Biol.

Moreover, a role for surface-exposed PIM as M. tuberculosis adhesins that mediate attachment to non-phagocytic cells has also been established (12Cywes C. Hoppe H.C. Daffe M. Ehlers M.R. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 4258-4266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hoppe H.C. de Wet B.J. Cywes C. Daffe M. Ehlers M.R. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3896-3905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of infected macrophages revealed that PIM, among other mycobacterial lipids, are actively trafficked out of the mycobacterial phagosome (14Beatty W.L. Rhoades E.R. Ullrich H.J. Chatterjee D. Heuser J.E. Russell D.G. Traffic. 2000; 1: 235-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). This could be of particular importance relating to the potential role played by these constituents in extending the influence of the bacterium over its surroundings. An unfractionated preparation of PIM, as well as phosphoinositol capped LAM (PILAM), was recently shown to activate cells via Toll-like receptor-2 (TLR-2) (15Jones B.W. Means T.K. Heldwein K.A. Keen M.A. Hill P.J. Belisle J.T. Fenton M.J. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2001; 69: 1036-1044PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of TLR-dependent signaling pathways leads to the activation of genes that participate in innate immune responses, such as expression of cytokines, coactivation molecules, and nitric oxide (16Heldwein K.A. Fenton M.J. Microbes Infect. 2002; 4: 937-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 17Takeda K. Kaisho T. Akira S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 335-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (4767) Google Scholar). Finally, PIM6 as well as ManLAM from Mycobacterium leprae and M. tuberculosis are presented by antigen-presenting cells in the context of CD1b (18Sieling P.A. Chatterjee D. Porcelli S.A. Prigozy T.I.

The high affinity interaction of CD1b molecules with the PIM2 acyl side chains was then established (19Ernst W.A. Maher J. Cho S. Niazi K.R. Chatterjee D. Moody D.B. Besra G.S. Watanabe Y. Jensen P.E. Porcelli S.A. Kronenberg M. Modlin R.L. Immunity. 1998; 8: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The phosphatidylinositol moiety plays a central role in the process of PIM and ManLAM binding to CD1b proteins. Here we investigated the structure of the most polar PIM isolated from M. bovis BCG, PIM6. The earlier NMR studies conducted on PIM2 and PIM6 by Severn et al. (20Severn W.B. Furneaux R.H. Falshaw R. Atkinson P.H. Carbohydr. Res. 1998; 308: 397-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) focused on the deacylated molecules, thus excluding the study of the lipidic moieties. In this study, we investigated the chemical structure of native PIM6, focusing on the characterization of the different “acyl forms,” using sophisticated analytical tools such as MALDI-MS and two-dimensional NMR. Then we demonstrated the capacity of the PIM2 and PIM6 acyl forms to stimulate macrophages to produce cytokines, and we investigated the implication of the different TLR in this process.

Phospholipids were eluted using ammonium acetate containing organic solvents. Indeed, 0.1 m ammonium acetate in chloroform/methanol (1:2, v/v) (fraction A) allowed elution of 750 mg of phospholipids (enriched in phosphatidyl-myo-inositol di-mannosides (PIM2)),and 0.2 m ammonium acetate in chloroform/methanol (1:2, v/v) (fraction B) was subdivided into two fractions. The first volumes allowed elution of 440 mg of phospholipids (cardiolipids essentially), and the next ones allowed elution of 160 mg of phospholipids (mixture of phosphatidyl-myo-inositol dimannosides (PIM2) and hexamannosides (PIM6)), and finally, 0.2 m ammonium acetate in methanol (fraction C) allowed elution of 55 mg of phospholipids (enriched in PIM6). Repeated lyophilizations were necessary to eliminate ammonium acetate salts. PIM from M. smegmatis (ATCC 607) and M. tuberculosis H37Rv (ATCC 27294) were also analyzed. 2M. Gilleron, V. F. J. Quesniaux, and G. Puzo, unpublished data. Purification of the PIM Acyl Forms—Fraction C (20 mg) was loaded in 0.1 m ammonium acetate solution containing 15% (v/v) propanol-1 to octyl-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences) column (20 × 1.5 cm) pre-equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was first eluted with 50 ml of equilibration buffer and then with a linear propanol-1 gradient from 15 to 65% (v/v) (250 ml each) in 0.1 m ammonium acetate solution at a flow rate of 5 ml/h. The fractions were collected every 30 min. 20 μl of each fraction was dried and submitted to acidic hydrolysis (100 μl of trifluoroacetic acid, 2 m, 2 h at 110 °C). The hydrolysates were dried, reconstituted in water, and then analyzed by high pH anion exchange chromatography for mannose content giving the presented chromatogram (Fig. 2A). Fractions were pooled according to the purification profile, and repeated lyophilizations were performed to eliminate ammonium acetate salts. An acetone precipitation step was done on each fraction in order to eliminate contaminants issued from the propanol-1. Finally, 1.2 (fraction I), 1 (fraction II), 7.5 (fraction III), and 3 mg (fraction IV) were obtained. Purification was checked by TLC on aluminum-backed plates of silica gel (Alugram Sil G, Macherey-Nagel, Duren, Germany), using chloroform/methanol/water, 60:35:8 (v/v/v), as migration solvent. A sulfuric anthron spray and a Dittmer-Lester spray were used to detect carbohydrates containing lipids and phosphorus-containing lipids, respectively. Acetolysis Procedure—200 μg of PIM were treated with 200 μl of anhydrous acetic acid-d 4/acetic anhydride-d 6, 1:1 (v/v), at 110 °C for 12 h. The reaction mixture was dried under stream of nitrogen and was submitted to acetylation. The mixture was dissolved in acetic anhydride/anhydrous pyridine, 1:1 (v/v), at 80 °C for 2 h. The reaction mixture was dried under stream of nitrogen. 20 μl of chloroform/methanol, 9:1 (v/v), was added and analyzed in MALDI-Tof-MS in positive and negative modes. Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization-Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-Tof-MS)—Analysis by MALDI-Tof-MS was carried out on a Voyager DE-STR (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) using the reflectron mode. Ionization was effected by irradiation with pulsed UV light (337 nm) from an N2 laser. PIM were analyzed by the instrument operating at 20 kV in the negative ion mode using an extraction delay time set at 200 ns. Typically, spectra from 100 to 250 laser shots were summed to obtain the final spectrum. All of the samples were prepared for MALDI analysis using the on-probe sample cleanup procedure with cation-exchange resin (22Ludwiczak P. Brando T. Monsarrat B. Puzo G. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 2323-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The HABA matrix (from Sigma) was used at a concentration of ∼10 mg/ml in ethanol/water (1:1, v/v). Typically, 0.5 μl of PIM sample (10 μg) in a CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O solution and 0.5 μl of the matrix solution, containing ∼5–10 cation exchange beads, were deposited on the target, mixed with a micropipet, and dried under a gentle stream of warm air. The measurements were externally calibrated at two points with PIM. NMR Analysis—NMR spectra were recorded with an Avance DMX500 spectrometer (Bruker GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany) equipped with an Origin 200 SGI using Xwinnmr 2.6. Samples were dissolved in CDCl3/CD3OD/D2O, 60:35:8 (v/v/v), and analyzed in 200 × 5-mm 535-PP NMR tubes at 308 K. Proton chemical shifts are expressed in ppm downfield from the signal of the chloroform (δH/TMS 7.27 and δC/TMS 77.7). The one-dimensional phosphorus (31P) spectra were measured at 202 MHz with phosphoric acid (85%) as external standard (δp 0.0). All the details concerning NMR sequences used and experimental procedures were detailed in previous study on PIM2 (1Gilleron M. Ronet C. Mempel M. Monsarrat B. Gachelin G. Puzo G. J. Biol.

Immunity. 1999; 11: 115-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar), and their control littermates were bred under specific-pathogen-free conditions in the Transgenose Institute animal breeding facility (Orléans, France). Murine bone marrow cells were isolated from femurs and cultivated (106/ml) for 7 days in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium supplemented with 20% horse serum and 30% L929 cell-conditioned medium (as source of M-CSF, as described in Ref. 27Muller M. Eugster H.P. Le Hir M. Shakhov A. Di Padova F. Maurer C. Quesniaux V.F. Ryffel B. Mol Med. 1996; 2: 247-255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Three days after washing and re-culturing in fresh medium, the cell preparation contained a homogenous population of macrophages. The bone marrow-derived macrophages were plated in 96-well microculture plates (at 105 cells/well) and stimulated with LPS (Escherichia coli, serotype O111:B4, Sigma, at 100 ng/ml), bacterial lipopeptide (Pam3-Cys-Ser-Lys4, EMC microcollections; at 0.5 μg/ml), or PIM preparations at the indicated concentration. Lyophilized PIM preparations were solubilized in Me2SO and added in the cultures at a non-cytotoxic final concentration of 1–1.5% Me2SO (cell viability monitored by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay). Alternatively the macrophages were infected with M. bovis BCG (Pasteur strain 1173P2; kind gift from G. Marchal, Pasteur Institute, Paris, France; at a multiplicity of infection of 2 bacteria per cell). After 18 h of stimulation, the supernatants were harvested and analyzed for cytokine content using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reagents for TNF-α and IL-12p40 (Duoset R & D Systems, Abingdon, UK). Purification of the PIM 6 Acyl Forms from M. bovis BCG—An enriched fraction of phosphatidyl-myo-inositol hexamannosides (PIM6) was purified from M. bovis BCG as described previously (fraction C (1Gilleron M. Ronet C. Mempel M. Monsarrat B. Gachelin G. Puzo G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34896-34904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar)). Briefly, PIM are known to be found in the acetone-insoluble fraction of mycobacterial lipidic extract (28Gilleron M. Vercauteren J. Puzo G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3168-3179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The contaminating neutral compounds were eliminated by QMA anion exchange chromatography, irrigated with neutral eluents. The phospholipids were then eluted with ammonium acetate-containing organic solvents resulting in three fractions, A–C. These fractions were analyzed by ESI-MS in negative mode (1Gilleron M. Ronet C. Mempel M. Monsarrat B. Gachelin G. Puzo G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34896-34904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and revealed that fraction A mainly includes PIM2 containing a total of three and four fatty acids in addition to phosphatidyl-myo-inositol; fraction B contains PIM2 and PIM6 containing a total of three and four fatty acids, and fraction C mainly contains the different acyl forms of PIM6. Fig. 1 presents the negative MALDI spectrum of M. bovis BCG fraction C that is dominated by peaks assigned to deprotonated molecular ions (M – H)– revealing the different acyl forms of PIM6 present in this fraction. From the predominant fatty acids deduced from gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis (not shown), i.e. palmitic (C16), tuberculostearic (C19), and stearic (C18) acids and in minor amounts heptadecanoic acids (C17), the fatty acid composition of each acyl form was determined. We then confirmed mono-acylated forms (1Ac) with C16 (m/z 1543.6) or C19 (m/z 1585.7), di-acylated forms (2Ac) with 2C16 (m/z 1781.8) or 1C16,1C19 (m/z 1823.9), tri-acylated forms (3Ac) mainly with 2C16,1C19 (m/z 2062.1), and tetra-acylated forms (4Ac) mainly constituted by 3C16,1C19 (m/z 2300.3) or 2C16,2C19 (m/z 2342.4). M. tuberculosis H37Rv was found to produce as major PIM families PIM2 and PIM6 in the same acyl forms as the ones described for M. bovis BCG (not shown). To proceed in the separation of the acyl forms, 20 mg of fraction C were applied on an octyl-Sepharose column, using propanol-1 as eluent (Fig. 2A). The different acyl forms were eluted at concentrations of propanol-1 ranging from 25 to 50% and separated into 4 sub-fractions according to the profile elution determined by the mannose content. Each sub-fraction (I to IV) was collected and analyzed by negative MALDI-Tof-MS. MALDI-Tof-MS Characterization of the Octyl-Sepharose Column Fractions—The mass spectra of the fraction I (Fig. 2, B–C) revealed that it contained mono-acylated forms of the molecules (1Ac). Indeed, the analysis of fraction Ia revealed deprotonated molecular ions at m/z 1543.6 characterizing mono-acylated forms with C16 (Fig. 2B), whereas mono-acylated forms with C19 appeared more abundant in fraction Ib (m/z 1585.7) (Fig. 2C). The mass spectrum corresponding to fraction II showed three peaks with an intensity above 10% and were assigned to (M – H)– ions of di-acylated forms: two major peaks at m/z 1781.8 and 1823.9 and one minor one at m/z 1795.8 (Fig. 2D). The two major peaks were characterized as (M – H)– ions of di-acylated forms containing 2C16 and 1C16,1C19, respectively, and the minor peak corresponded to (M – H)– ions of the molecules acylated by 1C16,1C17. The mass spectrum of fraction III (Fig. 2E) revealed two peaks of intensity superior to 10% assigned to tri-acylated forms of the molecules. The major peak at m/z 2062.1 was attributed to (M – H)– ions corresponding to tri-acylated forms containing 2C16,1C19, whereas the minor one at m/z 2090.1 contains 1C16,1C18, and 1C19. The mass spectrum of fraction IV appeared more complex, constituted by a series of peaks (Fig. 2F) between m/z 2230.2 and 2356.4 and assigned to (M – H)– ions of different tetra-acylated forms. Indeed, the most abundant (M – H)– ions at m/z 2300.3 and 2342.4 characterized tetra-acylated forms containing 3C16,1C19 and 2C16,2C19, whereas the ions at m/z 2314.3 corresponded to tetra-acylated forms containing 2C16,2C18. Minor ions at m/z 2272.3, 2286.3, 2328.4, and 2356.4 were attributed to the molecules esterified by 3C16,1C17, 3C16,1C18, 2C16,1C18,1C19, and 1C16,2C18,1C19 or 1C16 and 1C17,2C19, respectively. In addition, species esterified by unsaturated fatty acids were also present as each peak consisted of a –2 analog. Therefore, we have developed a powerful preparative method of fractionation, leading to the purification of four purified PIM6, corresponding to mono-, di-, tri-, and tetra-acyl forms. The structural analysis is further detailed below for the most complex entities, tri- and tetra-acyl forms. Glycosidic Analysis of Native Tetra-acyl Forms—The sequence of glycosyl residues in PIM6 was established using a range of high resolution NMR techniques applied to the tetra-acylated molecules. The 1H NMR spectrum of the native molecules in CDCl3/CD3OD/D2O, 60:35:8 (v/v/v), at 500 MHz showed a complex anomeric proton region (between 4.4 and 5.1 ppm) (Fig. 3). Anomeric signals were investigated thanks to the 1H-13C HMQC spectrum (Fig. 3). Indeed, from the protons resonating between 4.4 and 5.1 ppm, two of them correlated with carbons out of the anomeric zone: proton at δ 5.02 correlated with a carbon at 70.6 ppm and proton at δ 4.53 correlated with a carbon at 71.7 ppm. From previous studies (1Gilleron M. Ronet C. Mempel M. Monsarrat B. Gachelin G. Puzo G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34896-34904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 2Gilleron M. Nigou J. Cahuzac B. Puzo G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 2147-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), they were respectively assigned to H2 of Gro and H3 of myo-Ins. These protons are deshielded due to the presence of gem acyl group. Moreover, the coupling constants measured on the proton at δ 4.53 (J 2,3 2.4 Hz and J 3,4 10.6 Hz) confirmed its attribution to myo-Ins H3. The other proton resonances correlating with carbons resonating around 100 ppm accounted for the six mannose units labeled from I to VI in decreasing order of their chemical shifts. Indeed, integration of the anomeric signals (H1) proved that the signal resonating at 4.88 ppm corresponded to two protons (II1 and III1). The α-anomeric configuration of the mannoses was deduced from the values of the one bound coupling constant (1 J C1,H1) above 170 Hz, measured on non-decoupled 1H-13C HMQC spectrum (not shown). The H2 protons of each α-Manp unit was determined using the COSY spectrum (Fig. 4A) although H2 of system I was partly hidden by the H3/H3′ of glycerol (Gro). The entire spin system of Gro can be analyzed from the COSY spectrum (Fig. 4A) and those of the myo-Ins from the HOHAHA spectrum (Fig. 4B). The six mannose spin systems could be completely assigned (Table I) using 1H-1H HOHAHA (Fig. 4B) and 1H-13C HMQC (Fig. 3). The deshielded values of the chemical shifts of the C2 of units I (δ 78.5) and IV (δ 79.1) and of C6 of units II (δ 65.8) and VI (δ 66.3) revealed the sites of glycosylation of the concerned units. The absence of deshielding concerning the carbons of systems III and V indicated that these units III and V were terminal. The chemical shift of the C6 of unit III (δ 63.9) (Table I) was intermediate between those of the C6 of units I, IV, and V (around 61.5 ppm) that were not glycosylated in C6 and those of the C6 of units II and VI (around 66.0) that were glycosylated in C6. Moreover, H6/H6′ protons of unit III were deshielded (4.02:4.15) (Table I). Thus, these data demonstrated that this unit is acylated in position 6.Table I1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts of the tetra-acylated forms measured at 308 K in CDCl3/CD3OD/D2O, 60:35:8, v/v/v123456ConclusionI5.023.833.643.393.483.47/3.642-O-Linked101.078.570.467.373.461.5II4.883.923.603.493.653.48/3.706-O-Linked101.870.170.967.070.565.8III4.883.843.583.473.784.02/4.15Terminal, 6-O-Acylated101.870.170.867.170.763.9IV4.863.703.683.423.423.51/3.602-O-Linked98.379.170.567.373.061.4V4.783.783.533.373.503.47/3.65Terminal102.370.471.067.471.061.5VI4.633.723.593.423.553.54/3.656-O-Linked99.770.370.867.370.966.3myo-Ins3.974.064.533.553.173.603-O-Acylated76.876.571.770.973.178.7Gro4.19/3.955.023.79/3.761,2-Di-O-Acylated62.970.663.6 Open table in a new tab The glycosidic sequence was next deduced from the inter-residual nuclear Overhauser effect contacts observed in the 1H-1H ROESY spectrum (Fig. 4C).

Thus, the AEP deficiency caused the accumulation of macromolecules in the lysosomes, highlighting a pivotal role of AEP in the endosomal/lysosomal degradation system. Lysosomes contain a variety of acid hydrolytic enzymes including proteases, glycosidases, and lipases and thereby provide the major site for degradation of macromolecules within a cell (1Pfeifer U. Glaumann H. Ballard F.J. Lysosome: Their Role in Protein Breakdown. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1987: 3-59Google Scholar, 2Mellman I. Fuchs R. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 663-700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two processes are responsible for the uptake of molecules in the lysosomes, autophagy and endocytosis. Cytoplasmic components including long-lived proteins and organelles are delivered to the lysosomes via autophagy. Extracellular or cell surface molecules are transported to the lysosomes via endocytic pathways by passing through two sequential intermediates, early and late endosomes. Obstruction of the degradation process in human leads to severe diseases generally called lysosomal storage disease (3Neufeld E.F. Annu. Rev.

Most of these diseases are autosomal recessive inherited disorders caused by a deficiency of a lysosomal enzyme. Thus, lysosomal degradation contributes to maintain homeostasis not only intracellularly but also throughout the body.Asparaginyl endopeptidase (AEP, 1The abbreviations used are: AEP, asparaginyl endopeptidase; VPE, vacuolar processing enzyme; DPPII, dipeptidyl peptidase II; ES, embryonic stem; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; E64, trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane; MCA, 4-methyl-coumaryl-7-amide.1The abbreviations used are: AEP, asparaginyl endopeptidase; VPE, vacuolar processing enzyme; DPPII, dipeptidyl peptidase II; ES, embryonic stem; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; E64, trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane; MCA, 4-methyl-coumaryl-7-amide.

This family was originally identified in higher plants as vacuolar processing enzyme (VPE), which is the enzyme responsible for the processing and maturation of seed storage proteins in the vacuole (6Hara-Nishimura I. Inoue K. Nishimura M. FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). AEP shows the strict substrate specificity toward the carbonyl side of exposed asparagine residues on the surface of substrate molecules (7Hara-Nishimura I. Takeuchi Y. Inoue K. Nishimura M. Plant J. 1993; 4: 793-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 8Dando P.M. Fortunato M. Smith L. Knight C.G. McKendrick J.E. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 743-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). AEP is synthesized as an inactive preproprotein and auto-catalytically processed into the active mature forms. C-terminal and N-terminal propeptides of AEP are sequentially removed during its delivery to the acidic compartment (9Hiraiwa N. Nishimura M. Hara-Nishimura I. Plant J. 1997; 12: 819-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 10Halfon S. Patel S. Vega F. Zurawski S. Zurawski G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 114-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). C-terminal propeptide acts as an auto-inhibitory domain that masks the catalytic site; therefore, the removal of C-terminal propeptide is sufficient for the activation of AEP (11Chen J.M. Fortunato M. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 327-334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kuroyanagi M. Nishimura M. Hara-Nishimura I. Plant Cell Physiol. 2002; 43: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).Although AEP is postulated to have a regulatory role in the biosynthesis of lysosomal enzymes, only a few studies have examined the physiological function of AEP in mammals. The microbial antigen tetanus toxin C fragment is processed into peptides by AEP in the endosomal/lysosomal system of B cells. The generated peptides are then loaded on class II major histocompatibility complex molecules for antigen presentation (13Manoury B. Hewitt E.W. Morrice N. Dando P.M. Barrett A.J. Watts C. Nature. 1998; 396: 695-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Myelin basic protein is a potential human auto-antigen for class II major histocompatibility complex that is implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis. A dominant epitope of myelin basic protein contains a processing site for AEP. The destruction processing of this epitope by AEP limits its presentation in thymus (14Beck H. Schwarz G. Schroter C.J.

Immunol. 2002; 3: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In addition to these functions of AEP, the C-terminal propeptide of AEP was identified as an inhibitor of osteoclast differentiation (17Choi S.J. Kurihara N. Oba Y. Roodman G.D. J. Bone. Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 1804-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The C-terminal propeptide was found to act as an inhibitor of AEP (11Chen J.M. Fortunato M. Barrett A.J. Biochem.

Plant Cell Physiol. 2002; 43: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and so there is a possibility that AEP is involved in the process of osteoclast differentiation.In this study, we examined the physiological function of AEP in vivo by generating and characterizing the AEP-deficient mice. AEP was abundantly expressed in kidney and localized in the late endosomes of the proximal tubule cells. Disruption of the AEP gene led to the enlargement of lysosomes in these cells in an age-dependent manner, which suggests that the materials to be degraded are being accumulated within the lysosomal compartments. Activities of lysosomal proteases, cathepsin B and dipeptidyl peptidase II (DPPII), increased while the cathepsin H activity slightly decreased. These results suggest that AEP has an important role in the endosomal/lysosomal degradation of kidney-proximal tubule cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDUREScDNA Cloning and Northern Blot Analysis—A mouse cDNA encoding AEP was isolated from an 11-day embryonic cDNA library (Clontech). The design of the PCR primers was based on the most conserved region among the plant VPEs, orthologs of AEP (5′-CA(T/C)CA(G/A)GC(G/A/T/C)GA(T/C)GT(G/A/T/C)TG(T/C)CA(T/C)GC-3′ and 5′-GC(G/A/T)AT(G/A)TC(G/A)TC(G/A)TACAT-3′). The PCR fragment amplified with the primers was used for screening the cDNA library. Northern blot analysis was performed with Mouse RNA Master Blot (Clontech). A probe was prepared with a Megaprime DNA-labeling system (Amersham Biosciences) using a SphI-HindIII fragment of AEP cDNA as a template. The signals were detected with BAS-III imaging plate and BAS2000 (Fuji Film). The signal intensities were quantified with the Image Gauge program (Fuji Film).Targeted Disruption of the AEP Gene—A 129/Sv genomic library was donated by Dr. Masahiko Hatano of Chiba University. Genomic clones for AEP were isolated from the library using the AEP cDNA as a probe. Construction of a targeting vector is schematically represented in Fig. 1. A SacI-BamHI 2.2-kb fragment including three putative exons, one of which encodes a catalytic center of Cys-191, was flanked by two identically oriented loxP recombination sites (floxed).

The homologous recombination was identified by PCR using primers 5′-TCTTGTCTTTCAGTATGGGATGGGATGGAGTG-3′ and 5′-TATACGAAGTTATCTCGAGTCGCTCG-3′. To verify the results of PCR screening, the BglII fragment of the genomic DNA extracted from the PCR-positive ES clone was hybridized with the 5′-external probe (data not shown) and the EcoRI fragment was hybridized with the 3′-external probe (Fig. 1B, lane 2). 7 ES clones among 578 neomycin-resistant clones revealed the desired homologous recombination. These clones were also subjected to a Southern blot analysis using a neoprobe to be tested for a single integration. To obtain a deleted allele, an adenovirus vector expressing Cre recombinase (22Kanegae Y. Lee G. Sato Y. Tanaka M. Nakai M. Sakaki T. Sugano S. Saito I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3816-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar) was used to infect two independent ES clones. 35 clones of the selected 46 clones had the desired deletion. The EcoRI fragment of the genomic DNA was subjected to Southern blot analyses using an external 3′ probe to confirm the deletion (Fig. 1B, lane 3).Chimeric mice were generated by the sandwich aggregation method (23Nagy A. Rossant J. Nagy R. Abramow-Newerly W. Roder J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8424-8428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1960) Google Scholar) using two floxed ES cell clones and two deleted ES cell clones. Germ line transmission was confirmed with every clone. Mice heterozygous for the mutation were obtained by cross-breeding of the chimeras with C57BL/6J (B6) females. The resulting heterozygotes were then intercrossed to obtain homozygous and wild-type littermates or further backcrossed with B6 mice. Genotypes were determined by PCR of tail DNA (Fig. 1C). The phenotypes described here were determined with 129/Sv-B6-mixed background mice and identical in the two independent lines with the disrupted allele. Mice were kept under specific pathogen-free conditions in an environmentally controlled clean room at the Center for Transgenic Animals and Plants, National Institute for Basic Biology. The experiments were conducted according to the institutional ethical guidelines for animal experiments and the safety guidelines for gene manipulation experiments.Antibodies—Anti-mouse AEP antibodies were prepared by immunizing rabbits with a bacterially expressed His6-tagged fusion protein of AEP (from Cys-52 to His-164). We used a monoclonal antibody for lamp-2 (rat clone GL2A7) from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (University of Iowa), goat polyclonal antibodies for cathepsin D from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, anti-cathepsin B and anti-cathepsin L antibodies from Drs. Kazumi Ishidoh and Eiki Kominami of Juntendo University, and anti-cathepsin H antibodies from Dr. Yasuo Uchiyama of Osaka University. Cy-3-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratory and Amersham Biosciences. Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes.Immunoblot Analysis—Mice were deeply anesthetized and perfused with PBS before organs were removed. Organs were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, disrupted with Cryopress (CP-100, Microtec Nition, Chiba, Japan), and homogenized in suitable buffers with a Polytron (PT10-35, Kinematica, Lucerne, Switzerland). Protein concentrations were determined with BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The homogenates were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The separated proteins were electrically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes followed by an immunoblot analysis. The bands were visualized with the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences) and analyzed with LAS1000 plus (Fuji Film).Enzyme Assays—Enzyme activity was measured at 37 °C with the selective fluorescent substrate (final concentration of 1 mm) for each protease. Buffers used were 0.1 m sodium citrate phosphate (pH 4.5), 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 m dithiothreitol for AEP (5Chen J.M. Dando P.M. Rawlings N.D. Brown M.A. Young N.E. Stevens R.A. Hewitt E. Watts C. Barrett A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8090-8098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar); 75 mm phosphate (pH 6.0), 1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm cysteine for cathepsin B; 0.1 m acetate (pH 5.5), 1 mm, EDTA, and 2 mm dithiothreitol for cathepsin B/L; 0.1 m phosphate (pH 6.8), 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm cysteine for cathepsin H; and 80 mm borate, 20 mm citrate, 0.1 m phosphate (pH 5.3) for DPPII (24Claus V. Jahraus A. Tjelle T. Berg T. Kirschke H. Faulstich H. Griffiths G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9842-9851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The substrates used were Z-Ala-Ala-Asn-MCA for AEP, Z-Arg-Arg-MCA for cathepsin B, Z-Phe-Arg-MCA for cathepsin B/L; Arg-MCA for cathepsin H, and Lys-Ala-MCA for DPPII. All of the substrates were purchased from Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan). The fluorochromes were quantified using an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and an emission wavelength at 460 nm. One unit of the enzyme activity is the amount of each enzyme that cleaves 1 nmol of substrate/min.RNA isolation and Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from kidney. First-strand cDNA was synthesized by incubating 1 μg of the purified RNA with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT) primers at 37 °C. The resulting cDNA was then subjected to PCR using primers 5′-ATGACCTGGAGAGTGGCTG-3′ and 5′-CGTTGATGTCGTCGGGCA-3′ for AEP transcript and 5′-GTGGGCCGCTCTAGGCACCA-3′ and 5′-CGGTTGGCCTTAGGGTTCAGGGGGG-3′ for β-actin transcript.Immunofluorescent Microscopy—Mice were deeply anesthetized and fixed by vascular perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.2% picric acid, and 0.1 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) at a room temperature. The fixed kidneys were cut into small pieces and cryoprotected in PBS containing 20% sucrose overnight at 4 °C. The samples were embedded in the Tissue-Tek OCT compound (Sakura Finetechnical, Tokyo, Japan) and frozen on the surface of liquid nitrogen. 6-μm-thick sections were cut on a cryostat (Frigocut 2800E, Reichert-Jung) and collected on coated slides. The sections were washed briefly in PBS and permeabilized in PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.3% Triton X-100 to detect both AEP and cathepsin D. In the case of double staining of AEP and lamp-2, sections were permeabilized in PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.3% saponin. The sections were incubated with the primary antibodies followed by fluorescence-labeled secondary antibodies and inspected with a laser-scanning confocal imaging system (LSM510, Carl Zeiss).Electron Microscopy—Mice were fixed as described above with the exception that 2.5% glutaraldehyde was used instead of 4% paraformaldehyde. The removed kidneys were further fixed for 2 h in the same fixative and subjected to standard electron microscopic techniques as described previously (25Yamamoto A. Masaki R. Tashiro Y. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1727-1738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For immunoelectron microscopy, the cryosections prepared as described above were reacted with anti-AEP antibodies followed by colloidal gold-conjugated secondary antibodies. The gold labeling was intensified with a silver enhancement kit (Nanoprobes) as described previously (26Koh S. Yamamoto A. Inoue A. Inoue Y. Akagawa K. Kawamura Y. Kawamoto K. Tashiro Y. J. Neurocytol. 1993; 22: 995-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The cryosections were then dehydrated, embedded in LR White resin (London Resin, Hampshire, United Kingdom), and processed further according to standard electron microscopic technique (25Yamamoto A. Masaki R. Tashiro Y. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1727-1738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ultra-thin sections were observed under a Hitachi H700 electron microscopy (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan).RESULTSAEP-deficient Mice—AEP mRNA expression was by far the highest in kidney (Fig. 1D) as reported previously (5Chen J.M. Dando P.M. Rawlings N.D. Brown M.A. Young N.E. Stevens R.A. Hewitt E. Watts C. Barrett A.J. J. Biol.

J. 1998; 335: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The expression levels in other organs such as eye, liver, and lung were less than an eighth of that in kidney. To demonstrate an in vivo physiological role of AEP, we generated AEP-deficient (AEP–/–) mice. Neither AEP transcript (Fig. 1E) nor protein (Fig. 3A) was detected in the AEP–/– mice, indicating the disruption of this gene.Fig. 3AEP is responsible for processing of multiple lysosomal proteases. A, kidney homogenates (20 μg of proteins) prepared from AEP+/+ (+/+), AEP+/– (+/–), and AEP–/– (–/–) mice were subjected to immunoblotting with specific antibodies against each of AEP, cathepsin H, cathepsin B, and cathepsin L. The AEP deficiency caused an increase in the level of single-chain forms of these proteases. A single-chain form (S) and a two-chain form (T) are indicated on the blot for each enzyme. B, the homogenates were prepared from kidneys of AEP+/+ (black column), AEP+/– (gray column), and AEP–/– (open column) mice. Specific activities of proteases in these homogenates were measured with a selective substrate for each of AEP, cathepsin H, cathepsin B, cathepsin B/L, and DPPII (left panel). The residual activity to cleave Z-Ala-Ala-Asn-MCA in the AEP–/– mice is inhibited by E64 (right panel). Relative specific activities of the AEP–/– and the AEP+/– mice are indicated by percent of the activity of AEP+/+ mice.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Crosses of the AEP+/– mice resulted in progeny with the expected Mendelian frequencies, indicating that AEP was not essential for normal development. The AEP–/– mice were fertile and had no gross anatomical and morphological abnormalities, although they were slightly smaller than the wild-type (AEP+/+) and AEP+/– mice (Fig. 2). The increase in body weight of the AEP–/– mice was almost the same as that of their AEP+/+ and AEP+/– littermates for 20 weeks after weaning. Thereafter, the weight increase of the AEP–/– mice began to stagnate. The body weights of the AEP–/– mice significantly diverged from the AEP+/+ and AEP+/– mice after 40–50 weeks (p < 0.05 for females and p < 0.01 for males). At 50 weeks, the mean weights of AEP+/+ and AEP+/– mice were approximately the same. Their combined mean weights were 38.3 ± 6.34 g for females and 48.21 ± 6.91 g for males. At the same stage, the mean weights of female and male AEP–/– mice were 31.1 ± 4.35 and 38.7 ± 5.85 g, respectively. The mean weights of the 50-week-old AEP–/– mice were approximately 80% of those of the AEP+/+ and AEP+/– littermates.Fig. 2Body weights of AEP–/– mice were less than those of AEP+/+ and AEP+/– mice. Body weights of the AEP–/– mice (n = 10) and the wild-type mice (AEP+/+ and AEP+/–, n = 10) were monitored for 50 weeks after weaning. Differences were significant at the p < 0.05 level for females and at the p < 0.01 level for males.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Processing of Lysosomal Proteases in AEP – / – Mice—Cathepsins B, H, and L are synthesized as preproproteins and processed into their two-chain forms via single-chain forms (29Kirschke H. Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Sheterline P. Lysosomal Cysteine Proteinases: The Protein Profile. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1998Google Scholar). To determine the effect of AEP deficiency on the processing of cathepsins, the kidney homogenates of 4- and 7-month-old mice were subjected to immunoblot analyses with antibodies against each of the cathepsins. In AEP+/+ mice, cathepsins B, H, and L were detected as both the single-chain and two-chain forms (Fig. 3A). In contrast, only the single-chain form of each cathepsin was detected in the AEP–/– mice (Fig. 3A). This result clearly demonstrates that AEP is responsible for processing from the single-chain form into the two-chain form for cathepsins B, H, and L. In addition, it is noteworthy that the amount of cathepsins, especially for cathepsin L, increased in the AEP–/– mice (see “Discussion”).We next determined how the defects in the processing into the two-chain forms influenced the activities of the lysosomal proteases. Protease activities were based on the ability of homogenates of kidneys from 4-month-old mice to cleave selective fluorescent substrates to each enzyme (Fig. 3B). The activity to cleave Z-Ala-Ala-Asn-MCA, a selective substrate for AEP, in the AEP–/– mice was <10% of the AEP+/+ activity, whereas the activity in the AEP+/– mice was 65% of the AEP+/+ activity. The residual activity found in the AEP–/– mice was inhibited by 10 μm trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane (E64) (Fig. 3B, right panel) but not by 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride or 10 μg/ml pepstatin A (data not shown). This result indicates that the E64-sensitive cysteine proteinase(s) may contribute to the remaining activity to cleave the selective substrate for AEP. We did not find notable differences between AEP+/+ and AEP+/– mice in the activities of cathepsins B, L, and H and DPPII (Fig. 3B, left panel). Interestingly, cathepsin B and DPPII activities in the AEP–/– mice were almost twice those in their AEP+/+ littermates, whereas the activity toward the cathepsin B/L substrate was only slightly higher. On the other hand, cathepsin H activity in the AEP–/– mice was only approximately 50% of the activity in AEP+/+ mice.Late Endosomal Localization of AEP in the Kidney-proximal Tubule Cells—AEP was abundant in kidney (Fig. 1D). To determine its distribution in kidney, we performed immunofluorescent microscopy with anti-AEP antibodies. Kidneys of 1-, 3-, and 12-month-old-mice were fixed by perfusion and subjected to the analyses. Essentially, the same results were obtained from each of 1-, 3-, and 12-month-old-mice. AEP was found in a quite restricted region in the cortex (Fig. 4A, right) but not in the medulla, including the collecting tubule or the urinary tubule cells (data not shown). In the cortex, prominent AEP signals were detected at the proximal tubules and weak signals were observed at the distal tubules. In contrast, considerable signals were not detected at glomeruli. Preimmune serum did not make any signals (data not shown).Fig. 4Subcellular localization of AEP in the late endosomes of the kidney-proximal tubule cells.

To elucidate what the structures were, we performed double-labeling immunofluorescent microscopy with antibodies against cathepsin D, a lysosomal protease (Fig. 4B). The AEP-containing structures were mostly found on the apical side of the cells (Fig. 4B, left), whereas cathepsin d-positive lysosomes were distributed in the middle region of the cells (Fig. 4B, middle). AEP was scarcely colocalized with cathepsin D (Fig. 4B, right). These results suggest that AEP is localized in a subcellular compartment other than lysosomes.We next compared the localization of AEP with that of lamp-2, a marker for the late endosomes and lysosomes (30Granger B.L. Green S.A. Gabel C.A. Howe C.L. Mellman I. Helenius A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12036-12043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Most structures stained with anti-AEP antibodies were stained with anti-lamp-2 monoclonal antibody (Fig. 4C, right). This result suggested that AEP was localized in the late endosomes of the kidney-proximal tubule cells. We excluded the possibility that AEP was localized to the early endosomes because almost all of the AEP signals overlapped with those of lamp-2.To demonstrate the subcellular localization in greater detail, immunoelectron microscopy was performed with ultra-thin sections prepared from a kidney of a 4-week-old mouse. In the proximal tubule cells, AEP was localized in electron-lucent multivesicular body-like structures but not in the electron-dense uniform structures (Fig. 4D). The endocytic apparatuses in the proximal tubule cells are classified as follows: apical clathrin-coated pits; small coated and noncoated early endosomes (<0.5 μm); large noncoated endosomes (>0.5 μm); dense apical tubules; and the lysosomes (31Christensen E.I. Birn H. Verroust P. Moestrup S.K. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1998; 180: 237-284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The electron-dense uniform structures represent dense/mature lysosomes. We did not find any gold particle representing the AEP localization on these structures. This result corresponds with the observation that AEP was not colocalized with cathepsin D. The average diameter of the structures containing gold particles was 0.638 ± 0.153 μm (n = 10). The large noncoated endoso"

We detect six frequencies, among which appear the effects of rotational splitting with a spacing of approximately 0.0121 cycles per day, which implies that the star rotates very slowly. A nonadiabatic analysis of the oscillations allows us to constrain the metallicity of the star to Z epsilon [0.017,0.022], which agrees with a similar range derived from spectroscopic data. We provide evidence for the occurrence of core convective overshooting in the star, with alpha(ov) = 0.10 +/- 0.05, and we rule out rigid rotation."
https://openalex.org/W2022866123,"Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by congenital or acquired deficiency of ADAMTS-13, a metalloprotease that cleaves the endothelium-derived ultra-large multimers of von Willebrand factor (ULVWF).

Activity of ADAMTS-13 is usually measured in a static system under non-physiological conditions that require protein denaturation and prolonged incubation. We have demonstrated previously that ULVWF multimers, upon release from endothelial cells, form plateletdecorated string-like structures that are rapidly cleaved by ADAMTS-13. Here we report the direct interaction between ADAMTS-13 and VWF under both static and flowing conditions. ADAMTS-13-coated beads adhered to both immobilized VWF and ULVWF strings presented by stimulated endothelial cells. These beads adhered to VWF under both venous (2.5 dynes/cm2) and arterial (30 dynes/cm2) shear stresses. We then demonstrated that ADAMTS-13 beads adhered to immobilized recombinant VWF-A1 and -A3 domains, but soluble metalloprotease bound preferentially to the A3 domain, suggesting that the VWF A3 domain may be the primary docking site for the metalloprotease. We suggest that tensile stresses imposed by fluid shear stretch endothelial bound ULVWF multimers to expose binding sites within the A domains for circulating ADAMTS-13. The bound enzyme then cleaves within the A2 domain that lies in close proximity and releases smaller VWF multimers into the plasma.

The ADAMTS-13 deficiencies in these patients resulted from either the development of autoantibody against the metalloprotease in the acquired form (22Moake J.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 347: 589-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar) or the presence of mutations in the ADAMTS-13 gene in the congenital form (20Levy G.G. Nichols W.C. Lian E.C. Foroud T. McClintick J.N. McGee B.M. Yang A.Y. Siemieniak D.R. Stark K.R. Gruppo R. Sarode R. Shurin S.B. Chandrasekaran V. Stabler S.P. Sabio H. Bouhassira E.E. Upshaw Jr., J.D. Ginsburg D. Tsai H.M. Nature. 2001; 413: 488-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1424) Google Scholar). Although this proteolysis by ADAMTS-13 reduces the size and potency of ULVWF, it appears to be limited or regulated in vivo. For example, cleavage of VWF in vitro by ADAMTS-13 requires the substrate to be strongly denatured (1 m urea) and requires more than 24 h of incubation (17Furlan M. Robles R. Lamie B. Blood. 1996; 87: 4223-4234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Tsai H.M. Blood. 1996; 87: 4235-4244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This time course would obviously be insufficient to prevent the release of ULVWF into plasma in vivo, indicating that other factors are required for the efficient cleavage of ULVWF. Fluid shear stress may be one of these factors because it enhances the cleavage of plasma VWF in vitro (24Tsai H.M. Sussman I.I. Nagel R.L. Blood. 1994; 83: 2171-2179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, VWF circulating in plasma at a velocity similar to that of blood flow is likely exposed to a minimal amount of shear stress unless it is anchored to the vessel wall, suggesting that vascular endothelium may play an important role in the ULVWF proteolysis. Recently, we have demonstrated that ULVWF multimers secreted from endothelial cells are anchored to the cell surface as extraordinarily long string-like structures capable of binding platelets (13Dong J.F. Moake J.L. Nolasco L. Bernardo A. Arceneaux W. Shrimpton C.N. Schade A.J. McIntire L.V. Fujikawa K. Lopez J.A. Blood. 2002; 100: 4033-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). These ULVWF multimeric strings were rapidly cleaved (100% within 2 min) by ADAMTS-13, usually at their upstream ends. These results suggest that the cleavage of newly released ULVWF may predominantly occur on the surface of endothelial cells, providing an efficient mechanism that prevents the release of the hyper-reactive ULVWF into plasma. This mechanism is consistent with a recent report by Andre et al. (25Andre P. Denis C.V. Ware J. Saffaripour S. Hynes R.O. Ruggeri Z.M. Wagner D.D. Blood. 2000; 96: 3322-3328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showing that GP Ibα-mediated platelet adhesion in vivo to stimulated mouse venular endothelium is dependent upon the endothelial cell-derived VWF. An interesting observation of this study is that platelet adhesion to endothelium begins within 15 s of stimulation and peaks after about 1 min, with a subsequent decrease in the number of adherent platelets. This time sequence coincides with our real time observation of ADAMTS-13 cleavage of ULVWF strings on the surface of stimulated human endothelial cells (13Dong J.F. Moake J.L. Nolasco L. Bernardo A. Arceneaux W. Shrimpton C.N. Schade A.J. McIntire L.V. Fujikawa K. Lopez J.A. Blood. 2002; 100: 4033-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Because ADAMTS-13 is a secreted protein lacking a transmembrane domain, it has to be captured to ULVWF from rapidly circulating plasma. Here we report that ADAMTS-13 interacts with VWF under both static and flowing conditions, and the interaction is predominantly through the A3 domain of VWF. These results may provide a means for ADAMTS-13 to form an enzyme-substrate complex and to cleave VWF strings on endothelial cells in blood flow. Platelet and Plasma Preparations—Freshly drawn blood from 28 healthy donors was used as the source of plasma and platelets under a protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Baylor College of Medicine. All donors signed consent forms before blood was drawn. The donor pool consisted of 16 females and 12 males, ranging in age from 24 to 48 years. Whole blood drawn into 10% acid-citrate dextrose buffer (ACD, 85 mm sodium citrate, 111 mm glucose, and 71 mm citric acid) and was centrifuged at 150 × g for 15 min at 24 °C to obtain platelet-rich plasma (PRP), which was then centrifuged at 900 × g for 10 min to separate the platelets from the plasma. Platelet pellets were washed once with a CGS buffer (13 mm sodium citrate, 30 mm glucose, and 120 mm sodium chloride, pH 7.0) and resuspended in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free Tyrode's buffer (138 mm sodium chloride, 5.5 mm glucose, 12 mm sodium bicarbonate, 2.9 mm potassium chloride, and 0.36 mm dibasic sodium phosphate, pH 7.4). Plasma obtained using d-Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethyl ketone, HCl (75 μm final concentration) as anticoagulant was used as the source of ADAMTS-13. Endothelial Culture—Endothelial cells were obtained from human umbilical veins (HUVEC) under a protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Baylor College of Medicine, as described previously (13Dong J.F. Moake J.L. Nolasco L. Bernardo A. Arceneaux W. Shrimpton C.N. Schade A.J. McIntire L.V. Fujikawa K. Lopez J.A. Blood. 2002; 100: 4033-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar, 26Moake J.L. Turner N.A. Stathopoulos N.A. Nolasco L.H. Hellums J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 1456-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). The umbilical cords were washed with phosphate buffer (140 mm NaCl, 0.4 mm KCl, 1.3 mm NaH2PO4, 1.0 mm Na2HPO4, 0.2% glucose, pH 7.4) and then infused with a collagenase solution (0.02%, Invitrogen). After 30 min of incubation at room temperature, the cords were rinsed with 100 ml of the phosphate buffer. Elutes containing endothelial cells were centrifuged at 250 × g for 10 min. The cell pellets were resuspended in Medium 199 (Invitrogen) containing 20% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 0.2 mm of l-glutamine and plated on culture dishes coated with 1% gelatin. Endothelial cells were activated with 25 μm histamine (Sigma) for 10 min at room temperature before the perfusion experiments. Parallel-plate Flow Chamber—We induced secretion and formation of ULVWF strings on endothelial cells using a previously described method with slight modifications (13Dong J.F. Moake J.L. Nolasco L. Bernardo A. Arceneaux W. Shrimpton C.N. Schade A.J. McIntire L.V. Fujikawa K. Lopez J.A. Blood. 2002; 100: 4033-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar, 27Dong J.F. Berndt M.C. Schade A. McIntire L.V. Andrews R.K. Lopez J.A. Blood. 2001; 97: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Briefly, HUVECs growing in a 35-mm cell culture dish were stimulated with histamine and then assembled to form the bottom of the parallel plate flow chamber (Glycotech, Rockville, MD). The assembled chamber was connected to a syringe pump to draw the Tyrode's buffer containing washed platelets through the chamber at defined flow rates to generate specific wall shear stresses. The chamber was mounted onto an inverted stage microscope (Nikon, Eclipse TE300, Garden City, NY) equipped with a high speed digital camera (Photometrics, Model Quantix, Tucson, AZ) and kept at 37 °C with a thermostatic air bath during the experiments. Acquired images were analyzed offline using MetaMorph software (Universal Images, West Chester, PA). Under this experimental condition, ULVWF released from endothelial cells formed string-like structures that were quantitated by counting individual strings in 20 continuous ×400 view fields after 2-min perfusion of the platelet suspension. For cell-free flow experiments with polystyrene beads coated with test proteins, a glass coverslip coated with proteins under evaluation was assembled as the bottom of the flow chamber. ADAMTS-13 beads in Tyrode's buffer were perfused over the immobilized protein under either 2.5 or 30 dynes/cm2 shear stress. The number of adherent beads were counted after 2 or 5 min of perfusion. Polystyrene Beads and Protein Coating—Polystyrene beads with green fluorescence (0.5 μm in diameter, fluoresbrite YG microspheres, Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA) were coated with purified ADAMTS-13 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, beads were incubated with 200 μl of purified ADAMTS-13 (146 μg of total protein) overnight at room temperature with gentle shaking. Coated beads were washed twice with 0.5 ml of borate buffer, pH 8.5, and then incubated with 1 ml of 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 30 min at room temperature. The beads were washed again with borate buffer and resuspended in PBS buffer containing 1% BSA. Control beads were coated with 10% BSA alone. VWF-coated coverslips were prepared as described previously (27Dong J.F. Berndt M.C. Schade A. McIntire L.V. Andrews R.K. Lopez J.A. Blood. 2001; 97: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 28Dong J. Ye P. Schade A.J. Gao S. Romo G.M. Turner N.T. McIntire L.V. Lopez J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16690-16694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, glass coverslips were incubated with either ULVWF (2 μg/ml), plasma VWF (20 μg/ml), or recombinant VWF A domains (100 μg/ml) for 2 h at room temperature. Non-absorbed proteins were then removed by washing the coverslips with PBS buffer immediately before use. Coverslips coated with 5% of BSA were used as controls. Purification of Plasma VWF and Endothelium-derived ULVWF— Plasma VWF was purified from human cryoprecipitate by glycine and NaCl precipitation and chromatography on a Sepharose 4B column (2.5 × 50 cm, a bed volume of 3000 ml, Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (26Moake J.L. Turner N.A. Stathopoulos N.A. Nolasco L.H. Hellums J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 1456-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). ULVWF multimers were produced from HU-VECs as described previously (10Moake J.L. Rudy C.K. Troll J.H. Weinstein M.J. Colannino N.M. Azocar J. Seder R.H. Hong S.L. Deykin D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1982; 307: 1432-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar, 26Moake J.L. Turner N.A. Stathopoulos N.A. Nolasco L.H. Hellums J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 1456-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 29Ruggeri Z.M. Zimmerman T.S. Blood. 1981; 57: 1140-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For this, the confluent HU-VECS were washed with PBS and incubated with a serum-free medium (insulin 5–10 μg/ml, transferrin 5 μg/ml, M199, 1% glutamine) for 48–72 h. The cultured cells were then treated with 100 μm histamine for 30 min at 37 °C to induce the release of ULVWF. After incubation, the conditioned medium was centrifuged at 150 × g for 10 min to remove cell debris, and the supernatant was used as the source of ULVWF multimers. The multimeric composition of purified plasma VWF and ULVWF was evaluated by SDS, 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and chemiluminescence. Purification of ADAMTS-13—ADAMTS-13 was purified to the DEAE column step from factor VIII/VWF concentrate by the method described earlier (30Fujikawa K. Suzuki H. McMullen B. Chung D. Blood. 2001; 98: 1662-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Purified ADAMTS-13 cleaved VWF in overnight incubation in the presence of 1 m urea and BaCl2, yielding 176- and 140-kDa fragments on reduced SDS-PAGE gels. Purification of Human Glycocalicin—Human glycocalicin was purified from platelets by a method described previously (31Romo G.M. Dong J.F. Schade A.J. Gardiner E.E. Kansas G.S. Li C.Q. McIntire L.V. Berndt M.C. Lopez J.A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 803-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 liters of outdated PRP was centrifuged at 150 × g for 15 min. The platelet pellet was suspended in 500 ml of buffer B (10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4) and sonicated. The resultant suspension was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min to allow the calpain released from the platelets to cleave glycocalicin from membrane-bound GP Ibα. After removal of cell debris, the glycocalicin in the supernatant was first absorbed to a wheat germ Sepharose 4B column and eluted with 2.5% N-acetyl-d-glucosamine and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The eluate was then applied to an ion exchange column (Q-Sepharose Fastflow column; Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with a linear salt gradient of 0–0.7 m NaCl in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Expression and Purification of the Recombinant A Domains of VWF— The recombinant VWF A domains (A1, A2, and A3) were expressed as histidine-tagged fusion proteins (His6) and purified by a method described previously (32Cruz M.A. Diacovo T.G. Emsley J. Liddington R. Handin R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19098-19105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 33Cruz M.A. Yuan H. Lee J.R. Wise R.J. Handin R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10822-10827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 34Cruz M.A. Rivera R. Hayden J. Blood. 2002; 100: 259aCrossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Briefly, for the VWF-A1, the washed bacterial pellet was solubilized by 6.5 m guanidine hydrochloride in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The solubilized proteins, diluted 40-fold in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20, pH 7.8, were eluted with 350 mm imidazole from a Ni2+-chelated Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) (equilibrated with 25 mm Tris-HCl, 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.8 buffer). The isolated protein was adsorbed to and eluted from a heparin-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). The purified polypeptide was dialyzed against 25 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.8. For the VWF-A3, the washed bacterial pellet was solubilized by 7.5 m urea in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8. The solubilized protein was first dialyzed against 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, and then eluted from a Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) with sodium chloride. For the purification of VWF-A2 (amino acids 718–905), the washed pellet was solubilized by 7.5 m urea in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, and the solubilized protein was eluted from a Ni2+-chelated Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 5 m urea, 25 mm Tris-HCl, 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.8 buffer. The purified VWF A2 was dialyzed against 1 m urea, 25 mm Tris-Cl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. The buffer was rapidly changed to TBS, by using a desalting column. Soluble ADAMTS-13 Interaction with VWF A Domains—To evaluate the interaction of ADAMTS-13 with the VWF A domains in fluid phase, we took advantage of the C-terminal histidine tag to capture the recombinant A domains to the CM5 sensor chip (Uppsala, Sweden) using a monoclonal anti-His antibody. For this, each recombinant VWF-A domain was perfused over the anti-His antibody immobilized onto the CM5 sensor chip for 3 min at 25 °C in the BIAcore Biosensor (BIA-core™ 2000, Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Uncaptured protein was removed by washing the chip with 200 μl of PBS buffer for 3 min. The purified ADAMTS-13 was then perfused over the surface at a flow rate of 20 μl/min at 25 °C. Binding was monitored in real time for 3 min and expressed as resonance units. The recombinant I domain of the α2 chain of integrins was used as a negative control. The kinetics of the ADAMTS-13-A3 interaction was also determined by perfusing purified ADAMTS-13 (at 25, 50, 100, and 200 nm) over captured VWF A3. Statistical Analysis—All experimental data are presented as mean ± S.E. The unpaired two-tailed Student's t test was used for data analysis, and a p value less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. ADAMTS-13-coated Beads Adhere to Endothelial Cells and to VWF Strings under Flow—When a suspension of ADAMTS-13-coated fluorescent beads was perfused over histamine-stimulated HUVEC at 2.5 dynes/cm2 shear stress, the majority of adherent beads were bound to VWF strings with a small portion binding directly to endothelial cells (Fig. 1, left). Adhesion of beads to unstimulated endothelial cells was minimal, with no string-like structures formed (Fig. 1, right). When the ADAMTS-13 beads were perfused together with washed platelets (at a ratio of 1:1), they adhered to VWF strings in randomly spaced clusters (Fig. 2, top). The distance between the clusters varied considerably. By comparison, adhesion of washed platelets on strings was evenly distributed, filling the spaces between the clusters of ADAMTS-13 beads (Fig. 2, bottom). ADAMTS-13 that was coated onto polystyrene beads was able to cleave the VWF strings, but cleavage took significantly longer than did cleavage by the enzyme in solution (data not shown). This prolongation in cleavage times could have several causes, among them a decrease in the concentration of available enzyme on the beads compared with the soluble enzyme, diminished enzymatic activity of the bead-immobilized enzyme, or steric interference of the bead with access to the cleavage site. ADAMTS-13 Beads Binds VWF under Static Conditions— The unique pattern of adhesion of ADAMTS-13 beads strongly suggests that ADAMTS-13 directly interacts with VWF strings, but it may also be possible that ADAMTS-13 interacts with endothelium-derived molecules adjacent to VWF strings. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we examined adhesion of ADAMTS-13 beads to purified VWF in a cell-free system. The ADAMTS-13 beads were incubated with immobilized VWF for 10 min at room temperature, and the adherent beads were then counted after removal of unbound beads by PBS washing. ADAMTS-13 beads adhered specifically to immobilized VWF but not to a BSA-coated surface (Fig. 3A). The adhesion was blocked by a synthetic peptide derived from the CUB domain of ADAMTS-13 (HLEPTGT, Sigma Genosys, St. Louis, MO), but not by a scrambled peptide with the same amino acid composition (PELHTTG, Sigma Genosys) (Fig. 3B). In reverse experiments, polystyrene beads coated with ULVWF adhered to ADAMTS-13-coated surfaces but not to BSA surfaces (data not shown). ADAMTS-13 Interacted with Purified VWF under Flow—To determine the strength of the ADAMTS-13-VWF interaction, adhesion of ADAMTS-13-coated beads to immobilized VWF was also tested under flow in two ways. ADAMTS-13 beads were incubated over immobilized VWF for 5 min in a parallel plate flow chamber and then exposed to 2.5 dynes/cm2 shear stress for 2 min by perfusing buffer through the chamber. The adherent beads remaining were then counted. The number of adherent beads is related to the on-rate of the ADAMTS-13-VWF bond (35Dong J. Schade A.J. Romo G.M. Andrews R.K. Gao S. McIntire L.V. Lopez J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27663-27670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, significantly more ADAMTS-13 beads adhered to the VWF matrix than did BSA-coated beads (Student's t test, n = 6). Adhesion of ADAMTS-13 beads to immobilized VWF was also examined at 30 dynes/cm2, a shear stress that is often encountered in small arteries. After a 5-min perfusion at room temperature, adherent beads were counted and found to be significantly higher than those to the BSA surface (Fig. 5, Student's t test, n = 4, * p < 0.001). There was no difference in the numbers of adherent beads at the two shear stresses tested. This experiment is designed to answer two questions. First, can ADAMTS-13 form a bond with VWF quickly enough to attach the beads to immobilized VWF under flow conditions? Second, once formed, is the ADAMTS-13-VWF bond strong enough to withstand the tensile force generated by flowing buffer? Answers to these questions provide physiological relevance of this interaction. ADAMTS-13 Interact with the A Domains of VWF under Flow—Having demonstrated a direct interaction between ADAMTS-13 and VWF, we investigated the regions of VWF that may interact with ADAMTS-13. Because ADAMTS-13 cleaves within the A2 domain of VWF, we first focused on the A domains of VWF as potential ADAMTS-13 docking site(s). ADAMTS-13 beads were incubated with each of the three immobilized recombinant A domains for 5 min and then exposed to a fluid shear stress of 2.5 dynes/cm2 for 2 min. A significantly higher percentage of ADAMTS-13 beads remained adherent to the A1 and A3 surfaces, whereas the adhesion to A2 surface was minimal (Fig. 6, A and B). BSA beads failed to adhere to any of the A domain-coated surfaces. Similarly, ADAMTS-13 beads did not adhere to a BSA-coated surface. Adhesion of ADAMTS-13 beads to the A domains was prevented by pretreatment of these beads with soluble A domains (Fig. 6, C and D). In contrast, glycocalicin, the extracellular portion of GP Ibα1, failed to block binding of ADAMTS-13 to the immobilized A1 domain (Fig. 6C). ADAMTS-13-VWF Interaction Determined by Surface Plasmon Resonance—The previous section demonstrated the interaction between ADAMTS-13 and VWF with both proteins immobilized on a surface. Because immobilization is known to activate VWF (36Olson J.D. Moake J.L. Collins M.F. Michael B.S. Thromb. Res. 1983; 32: 115-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and the interaction between ADAMTS-13 and VWF in vivo likely occurs in solution, we tested by surface plasmon resonance whether soluble ADAMTS-13 would interact with the A domains in the fluid phase. For this, the A domain proteins were first captured through their His tags to the chips coated with a monoclonal anti-His antibody. Soluble ADAMTS-13 metalloprotease was then perfused over the chips. As shown in Fig. 7, ADAMTS-13 predominantly bound to the captured A3 domain and, to a lesser extent, to the A1 and A2 domains. By comparison, it did not bind to the surface coated with the immobilized I domain of the α2 integrin (Student's t test, n = 3). The kinetics of the ADAMTS-13-A3 interaction was determined by perfusion of ADAMTS-13 at concentrations of 25, 50, 100, and 200 nm over the captured A3 under a constant flow of 20 μl/min. The apparent disassociation constant (K d) was calculated to be 58.7 nm. In the current study, we demonstrated by several means that ADAMTS-13 interacts with VWF primarily through the VWF A domains. First, polystyrene beads coated with ADAMTS-13 adhere to ULVWF strings formed on histamine-activated endothelial cells. Second, ADAMTS-13 adhered to immobilized VWF under both static and flowing conditions. Third, ADAMTS-13 beads adhered to the immobilized A1 and A3 domains but significantly less to A2 domain. The finding that glycocalicin failed to block adhesion of ADAMTS-13 beads to the immobilized A1 domain suggests that the ADAMTS-13-binding site on the A1 domain is likely to be different from that of the platelet GP Ib-IX-V complex. In contrast to results obtained with immobilized ADAMTS-13, soluble ADAMTS-13 bound predominantly to the A3 domain and much less to the A1 domain in fluid phase as demonstrated by the surface plasmon resonance experiments. These results, combined with our previous finding that ULVWF forms string-like structures on endothelial cells under flow (13Dong J.F. Moake J.L. Nolasco L. Bernardo A. Arceneaux W. Shrimpton C.N. Schade A.J. McIntire L.V. Fujikawa K. Lopez J.A. Blood. 2002; 100: 4033-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar), provide a mechanism through which ADAMTS-13 cleaves ULVWF multimers that are newly released from endothelial cells. We hypothesize that, upon release from the Weibel-Palade bodies of stimulated endothelial cells through a triggering event, ULVWF multimers are anchored to the surface of endothelial cells and capture circulating platelets. The ULVWF anchorage and wall shear stress as well as torque forces applied to platelets adhered to VWF strings may stretch the ULVWF multimers into the elongated string-like structures to expose either the cleavage site or the anchorage site for ADAMTS-13. As a result, circulating ADAMTS-13 is able to bind to ULVWF strings to form enzyme-substrate complexes to cleave VWF. Once VWF is cleaved at selected sites, the fragments are released into plasma where they no longer experience the tensile stress as they do when tethered to the endothelial surface, and therefore are able to adopt a conformation that is no longer accessible to the metalloprotease. This is consistent with previous studies (37Siedlecki C.A. Lestini B.J. Kottke-Marchant K.K. Eppell S.J. Wilson D.L. Marchant R.E. Blood. 1996; 88: 2939-2950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showing that VWF multimers change from a globular structure to an extended linear one after being exposed to shear stress. This proposed mechanism of cleavage offers several advantages over other mechanisms. First, the cleavage occurs very rapidly under flowing conditions to satisfy the in vivo requirements. Second, it could explain the source of the size heterogeneity of plasma VWF. For example, VWF sites for ADAMTS-13 may not always be available, either because of an unfavorable conformation of the docking site or because of steric hindrance by platelets that adhere to the VWF strings first. In either case, the selective adhesion of ADAMTS-13 to VWF strings likely results in the release of VWF fragments of various sizes, yielding the size heterogeneity observed for plasma VWF. This suggestion is supported by our observation that the adhesion of ADAMTS-13 beads to VWF appears to be selective and discontinuous, leaving spaces of various lengths between two adjacent adhesion sites (Figs. 1 and 2). Third, this mechanism may explain why ADAMTS-13, which coexists with the VWF substrate in plasma, does not completely cleave the plasma VWF to its minimal form. One possibility is that the endothelium-derived ULVWF and plasma VWF interact differently with ADAMTS-13, possibly because of the different conformation of the A domains. We have observed such a difference for the VWF-GP Ib interaction (12Arya M. Anvari B. Romo G.M. Cruz M.A. Dong J.F. McIntire L.V. Moake J.L. Lopez J.A. Blood. 2002; 99: 3971-3977Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). We found that ULVWF forms spontaneous high strength bonds with the GP Ib-IX-V complex, with similar bond strengths to those formed between GP Ib-IX-V and the isolated A1 domain. The plasma form of VWF, on the other hand, does not spontaneously bind GP Ib-IX-V, requiring the modulators ristocetin or botrocetin to do so. When considered in the light of these findings, our current observations lend weight to the notion that the A domain region of VWF exists in an inherently different conformation in ULVWF than in the processed, plasma forms of VWF. Finally, this putative mechanism safeguards against the direct release of hyper-reactive ULVWF into plasma by allowing for its cleavage right at the site of its release. Because the cleavage site on VWF is in the A2 domain, it is logical for ADAMTS-13 to be anchored to the same domain. However, as shown in Fig. 6B, ADAMTS-13 bound equally well to the immobilized A1 and A3 domain but minimally to the A2 domain. Furthermore, when the interaction was induced in fluid phase as demonstrated by the surface plasmon resonance experiments, ADAMTS-13 bound predominantly to the A3 domain (Fig. 7). Because the cleavage of ULVWF in vivo occurs in the fluid phase (the VWF strings are anchored to only a few sites and appeared to wave in the flowing fluid rather than being attached firmly to the endothelial cells (13Dong J.F. Moake J.L. Nolasco L. Bernardo A. Arceneaux W. Shrimpton C.N. Schade A.J. McIntire L.V. Fujikawa K. Lopez J.A. Blood. 2002; 100: 4033-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar)), the ADAMTS-13-A3 interaction may be more relevant for docking the metalloprotease to VWF strings. In summary, we have demonstrated in this study that the VWF cleaving metalloprotease ADAMTS-13 binds to ULVWF under both static and flow conditions. The interaction is strong enough to resist considerable shear stress and has a fast on rate, meeting the critical requirements for the interaction to occur in rapidly flowing blood. Furthermore, the adhesion occurs randomly and discontinuously along the VWF strings with spaces of various lengths between the adhesion sites for ADAMTS-13, a phenomenon that may explain the heterogeneity of the size of plasma VWF. Finally, both A1 and A3 may contain the binding sites for ADAMTS-13, but the A3 domain appears to be more important in vivo for docking the metalloprotease to VWF strings on the surface of endothelial cells in flowing blood."
https://openalex.org/W2045049295,"Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) is a zinc-finger-containing transcription factor, the expression of which is enriched in the postmitotic cells of the intestinal epithelium. KLF4 is a target gene of the tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli (APC). We sought to determine the role of KLF4 in suppressing the tumorigenecity of RKO colon cancer cells, which do not express KLF4. We utilized an established system in RKO cells, in which an inducible promoter controls expression of KLF4. Four independent assays were used to assess the effects of KLF4 induction on tumor cells. We find that KLF4 overexpression reduces colony formation, cell migration and invasion, and in vivo tumorigenecity. The mechanism of action of KLF4 does not involve apoptosis. These findings, along with our previous findings that KLF4 induces G1/S arrest, suggest that KLF4 is a cell cycle checkpoint protein that can reduce tumorigenecity of colon cancer cells."

https://openalex.org/W1981234886,"The Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) encodes a FADD-like interferon converting enzyme or caspase 8 (FLICE) inhibitory protein (vFLIP) that prevents death receptor-mediated apoptosis by inhibiting the recruitment and activation of FLICE. Since vFLIP physically interacts with tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and TRAF2 mediates activation of the jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)/activation protein 1 (AP1) pathway, we hypothesized that vFLIP might also activate this pathway. To evaluate this hypothesis, we transiently and stably transfected a vFLIP expression construct and performed several complementary assays to document that vFLIP activates the JNK/AP1 pathway and does so in a TRAF-dependent fashion. As vFLIP also activates the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway and the NF-κB and JNK/AP1 pathways both modulate cellular interleukin-6 (cIL-6) expression, we postulated that vFLIP induces expression of this cytokine. We show that vFLIP induces cIL-6 expression and activates the cIL-6 promoter, and maximal activation of the cIL-6 promoter by vFLIP requires NF-κB and AP1 activation. In addition, vFLIP and latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA), another KSHV-encoded latent protein, potentiate each other's ability to activate the cIL-6 promoter. Gene silencing experiments by RNA interference demonstrate that vFLIP in BCBL-1 endogenously infected primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) cells mediates JNK/AP1 activation and cIL-6 expression. Thus, we conclude that vFLIP, in addition to its known effects on NF-κB activation, also modulates the JNK/AP1 pathway and induces gene expression from the cIL-6 promoter in a JNK/AP1-dependent fashion."
https://openalex.org/W2036177910,We report a transport study of nonequilibrium quasi-particles in a high-transition-temperature cuprate superconductor using the transient grating technique. Low-intensity laser excitation (at a photon energy of 1.5 electron volts) was used to introduce a spatially periodic density of quasi-particles into a high-quality untwinned single crystal of YBa2Cu3O6.5. Probing the evolution of the initial density through space and time yielded the quasi-particle diffusion coefficient and the inelastic and elastic scattering rates. The technique reported here is potentially applicable to precision measurements of quasi-particle dynamics not only in cuprate superconductors but in other electronic systems as well.
https://openalex.org/W1978391012,"We have previously reported that thrombin, the ultimate serine protease in the coagulation cascades, is a proinflammatory agent that causes proliferation and activation of brain microglial cells. However, participation of its principal receptor, the protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) appears to be limited to promoting microglial proliferation and not induction of inflammatory mediators. In the present study, we now report that thrombin action in promoting inflammatory mediators from brain microglia is mediated through another thrombin receptor, PAR4. Here we show that the PAR4 agonist peptide (PAR4AP, GYPGKF), but not the PAR1AP (TRAP, SFLLRN), induced tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) production not only in cultured murine microglial cells in vitro but also in rat cortex in vivo. Down-regulation of PAR4 expression in microglial cultures by a specific antisense, but not a sense, oligonucleotide reduced PAR4AP-induced TNF-α. Mechanistic studies indicated that, in comparison with PAR1 signaling, prolonged increase of [Ca2+]i and phosphorylation of p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinases, as well as NFκB activation may be responsible for PAR4AP-induced TNF-α production in microglia. Taken together, these results demonstrate that PAR4 activation mediates the potentially detrimental effects of thrombin on microglia, implying that perspectives of exploiting PAR1 as a potential anti-inflammatory target should be shifted toward PAR4 as a much more specific therapeutic target in brain inflammatory conditions associated with neurotrauma and neurodegenerations.

The inflammatory response is part of the normal defensive processes that may produce both beneficial and detrimental effects in tissues.

These include not only infectious CNS diseases but also acute CNS injuries such as traumatic brain injury (TBI) (1Csuka E. Hans V.H. Ammann E. Trentz O. Kossmann T. Morganti-Kossmann M.C. Neuroreport. 2000; 11: 2587-2590Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), spinal cord injury (2Popovich P.G. Prog. Brain Res. 2000; 128: 43-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), stroke, and brain ischemia (3Stoll G. Jander S. Schroeter M. Prog. Neurobiol. 1998; 56: 149-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). In addition, microgliosis is also intimately involved in several chronic neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (4McGeer E.G. McGeer P.L. Exp. Gerontol. 1998; 33: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 5Benveniste E.N. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Accompanying the focal accumulation of activated microglia are elevated inflammatory mediators in the brain, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and several classes of proteases, which are believed to contribute to the delayed or extended neuronal degeneration (1Csuka E.

Since neurons are largely irreplaceable, microglial-based inflammatory damage in the CNS has attracted considerable attention recently. Therefore, efforts to understand the fundamental mechanisms of microglial activation, and unique proinflammatory mediators, may identify novel therapeutic strategies to eliminate microglial deleterious effects. Among a myriad of microglial regulatory factors, the multi-functional serine protease, thrombin, is a recently discovered microglial activator. Prothrombin is highly concentrated in blood, circulating at micromolar levels (6Fenton J.W.d. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1986; 485: 5-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Prothrombin activation and extravasation of active thrombin into CNS parenchyma have been implicated in a number of CNS disorders such as TBI, stroke, ischemia, AD, and ALS (7Akiyama H. Ikeda K.

Neurosurg. 1997; 86: 272-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). It has long been known that thrombin is a proinflammatory agent in other tissues (13Strukova S.M. Biochemistry (Mosc). 2001; 66: 8-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) but it also can induce infiltration of inflammatory cells, edema, and reactive gliosis in the CNS in vivo (10Nishino A. Suzuki M. Ohtani H. Motohashi O. Umezawa K. Nagura H. Yoshimoto T. J. Neurotrauma. 1993; 10: 167-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). However, specific demonstration of direct activation of microglial cells by thrombin was only reported recently (14Moller T. Hanisch U.K. Ransom B.R. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1539-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 15Ryu J. Pyo H. Jou I. Joe E. J. Biol.

Neurochem. 2002; 80: 655-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). From the therapeutic point of view, systemic inhibition of the thrombin proteolytic activity is certain to induce severe anti-coagulation side effects, possibly even fatal bleeding in brain and elsewhere (17Festoff B.W. Mattson M.P. Neuroprotective Signal Transduction. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1997: 221-241Google Scholar). Therefore, identification of specific cellular/molecular target(s) mediating thrombin effect holds the key for developing safe and effective alternative therapeutic strategies. Thrombin-induced cellular effects are primarily mediated by means of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) known as protease-activated receptors (PARs) (18Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (2149) Google Scholar). Among four PARs (PAR1–4) identified so far, thrombin activates PAR1, PAR3, and PAR4, but not PAR2 (19Vu T.K. Hung D.T.

A. 1994; 91: 9208-9212Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). Regarding molecular mechanisms underlying thrombin-induced microglial activation, others have suggested that PAR1 is not involved in activation of microglia, using parameters such as inducible nitric-acid synthase (15Ryu J. Pyo H. Jou I. Joe E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29955-29959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our recent study demonstrated that although the prototypic PAR1 participates in thrombin-induced microglial proliferation, it does not mediate release of thrombin-induced potentially detrimental cytokines, such as TNF-α. This has cast in doubt the perspectives of PAR1 as the therapeutic target to exploit and suggested that more specific therapeutic target(s) remained to be identified. Since PAR3 has been suggested to function primarily as a chaperone for PAR4 rather than transducing signals on its own (18Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (2149) Google Scholar, 23Sambrano G.R. Weiss E.J. Zheng Y.W. Huang W. Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2001; 413: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), we have concentrated on determining just how PAR4 might participate in thrombin-induced microglial activation in this study. The evidence provided here indicates that persistent PAR4 intracellular signaling is largely responsible for thrombin-induced TNF-α release in microglia. The mechanisms involved include prolonged phosphorylation of p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and subsequent NFκB activation.

Cell culture supplies, Iscoves modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDM) and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) media, fetal bovine sera, and other routinely used reagents were from Sigma, GIBCOL, and Fisher. Cell Culture—The mouse microglial cell line, N9, was a gift from Drs. Bottani and Ricciardi-Castagnoli (Università Degli Studi Di Milano-Bicocca, Milan, Italy). Primary microglial cultures from the brains of neonatal C57BL6 mice were prepared and characterized as we previously described (16Suo Z. Wu M. Ameenuddin S. Anderson H.E. Zoloty J.E. Citron B.A. Andrade-Gordon P. Festoff B.W. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 655-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). One night before treatment, we replaced serum-containing media in primary and N9 microglial cells with serum-free DMEM and IMDM (Gly/Ser-free) media, respectively. All treatments were also performed under serum-free conditions in the corresponding culture medium. RT-PCR—Cultured cells were washed and then lysed in Trizol and total RNAs were extracted according to the manufacturer's recommendations. RNA concentrations were based on absorbance at 230, 260, and 280 nm. Reverse transcription-PCR was performed with 0.5 μg of total RNA, downstream primer sequence 5′-CGTACCTTCTCCCTGAACTC and upstream primer 5′-CCCCAGCATCTACGATGATG in a 50-μl volume with 5 units of rTth polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), 0.3 mm dNTPs, 2.5 mm MnOAc, 0.45 μm primer incubated at 60 °C for 30 min, 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min and 60 °C for 1 min. cDNA products were visualized after agarose gel electrophoresis and staining with ethidium bromide under UV light, and images were captured and analyzed with the aid of a CCD camera and NIH Image software. Intracortical Infusion—ALZET® Mini-osmotic pumps (Model 1003D, Alza Corp., Palo Alto, CA) were prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 1 day before surgery, all minipumps were primed in sterile 0.9% saline for at least 6 h, and then weighed, filled with treatment reagents, and weighed again. The concentrations of reagents filled in each minipump were calculated according to the weight difference before and after filling the pump with saline (100 μl/pump), human α-thrombin (11 units/100 μl/pump), PAR1AP (100 μm/100 μl/pump), and PAR4AP (100 μm/100 μl/pump). All procedures were performed under sterile conditions. Twelve male Sprague-Dawley rats (3–4 months old; 250–300 gm) were grouped as: 1) saline, 2) thrombin, 3) PAR1AP, and 4) PAR4AP with 3 rats per group. For surgery, animals were anesthetized with 2% xylazine plus 10% ketamine and immobilized in a rat stereotaxic apparatus. After incising the skin and removing the skull connective tissues, a small hole was drilled followed by placing a 30-gauge cannula into the cortical region using stereotaxic coordinates of bregma: –4.80 mm, right lateral: 3.00 mm and ventral: 1.60 mm according to Paxinos' Rat Brain Stereotaxic Coordinates (36Paxinos G. Watson C. The Rat Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates. 2nd ed. Academic Press, Sydney1986Google Scholar). The pre-filled ALZET osmotic minipump connected to the cannula was placed under the dorsal skin. Ten days following surgery, animals were re-anesthetized and perfused with saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde before removing the brains for immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry—Rat brains were routinely paraffin embedded, formalin fixed and sectioned with a thickness of 20 μm. After routine de-paraffinization, rehydration and blocking, sections were stained with mAb to TNF-α (1:250) followed by goat anti-mouse-Cy3 conjugates (1:500) and GSI-B4-FITC (1:500) staining. The slides were then mounted with Fluoromount and observed under a Nikon Bio-Radiance confocal microscope. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining was performed as previously described (24Suo Z. Fang C. Crawford F. Mullan M. Brain Res. 1997; 762: 144-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Western Blot (WB) Analysis—WB for PAR4 (1:500 dilution of the PAR4 pAb), γ-tubulin (1:1,000), total and phospho-p44/42 MAPK, and semi-quantitative analysis of protein band density were performed routinely as previously described (16Suo Z. Wu M. Ameenuddin S. Anderson H.E. Zoloty J.E. Citron B.A. Andrade-Gordon P. Festoff B.W. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 655-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Ca2 + Imaging—The relative [Ca2+]i changes in response to treatments of thrombin, PAR1AP and PAR4AP in primary microglial cultures were performed with Fluo-4 under a Nikon Bio-Radiance confocal microscope as previously described (16Suo Z. Wu M. Ameenuddin S. Anderson H.E. Zoloty J.E. Citron B.A. Andrade-Gordon P. Festoff B.W. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 655-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Nuclear Extract Preparation and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts from treated N9 microglial cells were prepared essentially as previously described (25Haglund R.E. Rothblum L.I. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1987; 73: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed in cold PBS and harvested by brief centrifugation. Cells were then swollen in hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm KCl) supplied with complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitors (200 pm cypermethrin, 25 μm dephostatin, 50 nm okadaic acid, 50 pm NIPP-1, 25 μm p-bromoter-ramisole oxalate, 5 μm camtharidin, 5 nm microcystin), and disrupted by homogenization with a glass Dounce homogenizer. After centrifugation at 4 °C at 15,000 × g for 10 min, nuclear pellets were collected and resuspended in half-pellet volume of low salt buffer (20 mm HEPES, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.02 m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). With stirring, an additional half pellet volume of high salt buffer (1.2 m KCl in low salt buffer) was added and followed by 30 min incubation with gentle agitation at 4 °C. After centrifugation, nuclear protein extracts were dialyzed against 50-fold excess volume of dialysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, 20% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). Protein concentrations were then determined by the BCA assay. For EMSA, nuclear proteins (5 μg) were incubated for 10 min at 25 °C with binding buffer (Promega) and phophatase inhibitor mixture, followed by addition of 2 μl of 175 nm CY5 fluorescent-labeled oligonucleotide (26Ruscher K. Reuter M. Kupper D. Trendelenburg G. Dirnagl U. Meisel A. J. Biotechnol. 2000; 78: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) containing specific binding sequences for NFκB: (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′) and incubation at room temperature for 30 min. Reactions were stopped by adding 1 μl of 10-fold TBE and the protein-DNA complexes were separated on a 6% DNA Retardation Gel (Invitrogen) and scanned by a Storm 860 Phospho-fluorImager. Measurements of TNF-α Production—TNF-α production into microglial culture media was measured and standardized as previously described (16Suo Z. Wu M. Ameenuddin S. Anderson H.E. Zoloty J.E. Citron B.A. Andrade-Gordon P. Festoff B.W. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 655-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—All qualitative analysis was repeated at least three times. Calcium imaging data were averages taken from three separate experiments. TNF-α levels were measured in duplicate for each sample, and each treatment was quadruplicated. Quantitative data are expressed as mean ± S.E. and analyzed by ANOVA using StatView 6.0 (Abacus Systems, Mountain View, CA). Post-hoc comparisons of means were made using Scheffe's or Tukey's method where appropriate. Mouse Microglia Express PAR4 —To determine whether or not PAR4 is involved in thrombin-induced microglial activation, we first determined whether PAR4 was expressed in microglia. To accomplish this we used both primary microglial cultures derived from C57BL6 mouse cortices with a purity of 96–98%, as we previously reported (16Suo Z. Wu M. Ameenuddin S. Anderson H.E. Zoloty J.E. Citron B.A. Andrade-Gordon P. Festoff B.W. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 655-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), as well as a clonal mouse microglial cell line, N9. Both primary and clonal microglia were cultured in normal growth media, and the cell lysates were analyzed by WB with PAR4-specific pAb. The results shown in Fig. 1 indicated that both primary and clonal mouse microglial cells constitutively express equivalent levels of PAR4 protein. In addition, we have also found PAR4 mRNA expression in the clonal N9 microglial cells (100% purity without contamination of other cell types, Fig. 1). Moreover, others have recently reported in abstract form that N9 and other clonal and primary microglial cells expressed PAR4 mRNA (27Moller T. Baslcaitis S. Xie Y. Weinstein J. Ransom B.R. Hanisch U.K. Soc. for Neurosci. Abst. 2002; 28: 101.103Google Scholar). Therefore, these studies clearly show that murine microglial cells express PAR4 at both mRNA and protein levels. PAR4AP Mimics Thrombin-induced Microglial TNF-α Production in Vitro—Having established that murine microglia express PAR4, we then assessed the effects of PAR4AP on microglial TNF-α production. For this purpose, primary microglial cultures were treated with increasing doses of either human α-thrombin, PAR1AP, or PAR4AP for 24 h as indicated (Fig. 2). TNF-α production in the culture media measured by ELISA showed that both thrombin (p < 0.001, dose versus thrombin) and PAR4AP (p < 0.01, dose versus PAR4AP), but not PAR1AP, dose-dependently induced TNF-α release from the microglial cultures. A peptide containing the same amino acids as PAR4AP, but in a scrambled sequence (KPGFYG), did not induce significant increase of TNF-α production, even at 100 μm, in a parallel experiment (data not shown). These results indicated that PAR4AP, but not PAR1AP, was able to mimic the thrombin-induced microglial TNF-α production in vitro. Thrombin and PAR4AP Activate Microglia in Vivo—To confirm this in vitro finding and extend it in vivo, we infused either saline, α-thrombin (11 units/100 μl), PAR1AP (100 μm/100 μl) or PAR4AP (100 μm/100 μl) separately into rat cerebral cortices with the aid of a pre-set osmotic pump (at 100 μl/72 h) to control the infusion rate. Ten days after the initial stereotactic surgery, brain sections were obtained for histological staining with a microglial marker, GSI-B4, along with a mAb to TNF-α (Fig. 3). We found that thrombin infusion induced significant microgliosis compared with saline infusion (restricted to the needle track). A significant proportion of the reactive microglial cells stained positively for TNF-α. In contrast, although PAR1AP induced a mild microglial proliferation, we were unable to detect TNF-α-positive cells with this peptide. On the other hand, we were surprised to find that PAR4AP induced a massive TNF-α-positive microgliosis, even greater than that observed with α-thrombin. HE staining indicated that PAR1AP induced a mild increase of dark blue-stained small nuclei (assumed microglial cells) without significant lesion, while both thrombin and PAR4AP induced significant increase of microglial cells along with apparent cortical lesions. These results indicate that both thrombin and PAR4AP, but not PAR1AP, were able to induce TNF-α-positive microgliosis in vivo. As such, they generally agree with our in vitro findings. Therefore, these novel findings indicate that PAR4AP can mimic thrombin-induced microglial TNF-α production both in vitro and in vivo. Down-regulation of PAR4 Reduces Thrombin- and PAR4AP-induced TNF-α—Although PAR4AP has been shown to specifically activate PAR4 in other cell types (28Faruqi T.R. Weiss E.J. Shapiro M.J. Huang W. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19728-19734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), to further confirm that PAR4AP-induced TNF-α production in microglial cells was indeed mediated via activation of PAR4, we attempted to down-regulate PAR4 and measured TNF-α production. For this purpose, we synthesized an antisense oligonucleotide (N185) that spanned the initial coding sequence of the murine PAR4 gene as well as a sense oligonucleotide (N186) with a complementary sequence to N185 (“Experimental Procedures”). Following 24-hour treatment of N9 microglial cells, WB of PAR4 revealed a dose-dependent (p < 0.01) reduction of PAR4 expression induced by the antisense N185. In contrast, the sense N186, at a concentration similar to the highest (1 μm) used for N185, failed to show significant effect (Fig. 4). When we increased the concentration of the antisense N185 further to 5 μm, no additional effect on PAR4 down-regulation (∼20% PAR4 remained after 1 μm N185 treatment, data not shown) was found. In addition, after stripping, re-probing with anti-γ-tubulin, a centrosome marker, showed equivalent amount of γ-tubulin expression among different lanes. The results confirmed that the loss of PAR4 expression is not related to cell death or an anti-proliferative response to the oligonucleotides. In parallel with the PAR4 WB analysis, the same PAR4 oligonucleotide-treated microglial cells were further treated with a single dose of either thrombin (100 nm) or PAR4AP (100 μm) for an additional 24 h. TNF-α production in the culture media was quantified by ELISA (Fig. 4). We found that the PAR4 antisense N185 induced a dose-dependent decrease of TNF-α secretion induced by thrombin (p < 0.001, N185 dose versa thrombin) and PAR4AP (p < 0.001, N185 dose versa PAR4AP). In contrast, the PAR4 sense N186 showed no effects on TNF-α secretion induced either by thrombin or PAR4AP. These results indicate that activation of PAR4 specifically mediated effects of thrombin and PAR4AP on microglial TNF-α induction. PAR4 Activation Induces Prolonged [Ca2 + ] i Increase and p44/42 MAPK Activation—Since both PAR1 and PAR4 appear to be expressed and fully functional in microglia, we went further to investigate why these two thrombin receptors might mediate distinct functions, particularly regarding TNF-α induction. Previous data from fibroblasts indicated that soon after activation, PAR1 was immediately desensitized while PAR4 was shut off much more slowly than PAR1 (29Shapiro M.J. Weiss E.J. Faruqi T.R. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25216-25221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). We have recently found that, once activated, microglial PAR1 is rapidly desensitized by G-protein-coupled receptor kinase-5 and -2, while a relatively nonspecific (unrelated to agonist stimulation), sluggish but constitutive PAR4 desensitization may take place in microglial cells. 2Z. Suo, M. Wu, B. A. Citron, G. T. Wong, and B. W. Festoff, manuscript in preparation. To determine if the differential desensitization of these receptors might be responsible for their distinct functions, we compared PAR1 and PAR4 downstream signaling in parallel. Increase of [Ca2+]i is one such downstream signal following PAR activation. When microglial cells were treated with 100 μm PAR1AP, a sharp increase of [Ca2+]i was followed by an immediate and complete decrease of [Ca2+]i to baseline (Fig. 5). Compared with PAR1AP, 100 μm PAR4AP induced a similar steep, although smaller, increase of [Ca2+]i followed by a significantly slower decline curve to ∼300 nm. It then remained at 200 nm above baseline until the end of the record (at least 4 min). The similar upwardly rising curves induced by PAR1AP and PAR4AP indicated that the ability for the two peptides to activate their corresponding receptors was not significantly different. However, the distinct downward curves implied that these two receptors were shut off differently. Changes of [Ca2+]i induced by 100 nm thrombin, which are sufficient to activate both PAR1 and PAR4, showed a curve that appeared to reflect a combination of effects of both PAR1 and PAR4 activation: a sharp upwardly rising curve and a downward curve, comprised of a rapid declining phase followed by a sustained phase. Together, these data suggested that PAR4 activation induced a prolonged [Ca2+]i increase as opposed to PAR1 activation, supporting the concept that PAR4 desensitization is considerably slower than PAR1. In addition to [Ca2+]i increase, we have previously shown that PAR1 activation in microglial cells induced a transient p44/42 MAPK activation with the peak occurring at 30 min (16Suo Z. Wu M. Ameenuddin S. Anderson H.E. Zoloty J.E. Citron B.A. Andrade-Gordon P. Festoff B.W. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 655-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). To further define differences between PAR1 and PAR4 signaling, we analyzed levels of phosphospecific and total p44/42 MAPKs in microglial cells at different time points (Fig. 6). We found that thrombin (100 nm) and PAR1AP (100 μm), as well as PAR4AP (100 μm), induced significant elevation of phosphospecific p44/42 MAPKs at 30 min. However, PAR1AP-induced p44/42 MAPK phosphorylation returned to control level while thrombin- and PAR4AP-induced p44/42 MAPK phosphorylation remained elevated at least 6–24 h after treatments. These results suggested that as compared with PAR1 signaling, PAR4 activation not only induced a prolonged [Ca2+]i increase but also a prolongation of p44/42 MAPK activation, which further supports the observation of “sluggish” PAR4 desensi"

Because ablation of AR activity is a critical goal of prostate cancer therapy, much emphasis has been placed on understanding the accessory proteins that regulate AR function in the prostate. Several co-activators have been shown to be required for full AR activity, including histone acetyl-transferases and TRAP/mediator complexes. SWI/SNF comprises a family of large, multisubunit complexes present in the cell, which contain one of two core ATPases required for nucleosome re-positioning, BRG1 or hBRM. We investigated the specific requirement of the SWI/SNF core ATPases for AR function. Using cells deficient in both BRG1 and hBRM, we show that activation of one AR target promoter, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), requires SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling for activity. A second AR target promoter, probasin, maintained a low level of activation in the absence of SWI/SNF. AR stimulation on the probasin core promoter could be partially induced with BRG1, but hBRM strongly stimulated AR activity. The PSA promoter was only induced by the restoration of hBRM. In contrast, ligand-dependent activation of the estrogen receptor was equally stimulated by BRG1 or hBRM. We demonstrate that the addition of a known enhancer region to the core PSA promoter bypasses the requirement for SWI/SNF on the PSA promoter, indicating that elements upstream of specific proximal promoters can impact the influence of the SWI/SNF complex on target gene activation. Addition of the enhancer to the probasin core promoter failed to impact the SWI/SNF requirement. In summary, SWI/SNF function potently regulates core AR target gene promoter activation, with a preference for hBRM-containing complexes. These studies highlight a role for the enhancer in altering the impact of SWI/SNF action and suggest a disparity in AR target genes for SWI/SNF requirement.

Although these methods are initially effective, recurrent tumors ultimately arise that lead to patient morbidity. The vast majority of such recurrent tumors contains inappropriately activated AR (1Feldman B.J. Feldman D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 34-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (1976) Google Scholar, 2Montgomery J.S. Price D.K. Figg W.D. J. Pathol. 2001; 195: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 14Grossmann M.E.

Restoration of AR activity following androgen ablation is known to occur through multiple mechanisms, including AR amplification, mutation of the AR ligand binding domain (thus allowing activation by non-androgenic steroids), and AR activation through alternate signal transduction pathways (3Culig Z. Klocker H. Bartsch G. Hobisch A. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2002; 9: 155-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 17Jia L. Kim J. Shen H. Clark P.E. Tilley W.D. Coetzee G.A. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 385-392PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, it has also been shown that AR accessory proteins are de-regulated in prostate cancer. For example, the co-activators SRC-1 and TIF2, members of the p160 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) family, are amplified in prostate cancer and are thought to contribute to inappropriate AR activation (18Gregory C.W. He B. Johnson R.T. Ford O.H. Mohler J.L. French F.S. Wilson E.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4315-4319PubMed Google Scholar). In light of these observations, there is an intensive focus on elucidating the role of co-activators in regulating AR activity. In general, AR co-activators serve to stabilize the receptor complex, promote DNA unwinding, and/or recruit the RNA polymerase II complex (19Heinlein C.A. Chang C. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 175-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar, 20Sommer S. Fuqua S.A. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2001; 11: 339-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Type I co-activators, such as SRC-1, TIF2, and pCAF/p300, are recruited by agonist-bound AR. These co-activators either harbor intrinsic HAT activity or recruit HATs to the AR complex. It is believed that the acetylation of lysine residues on core histones loosens chromatin and permits access for transcription factors to bind and activate promoters (19Heinlein C.A. Chang C. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 175-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar, 21McKenna N.J. Nawaz Z. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 2002; 9: 640-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Type II co-activators stabilize the ligand bound conformation of the AR homodimer, which leads to increased activation of androgen responsive genes. For example, the type II co-activator ARA70 stabilizes N- to C-terminal interactions of the androgen receptor, dependent on ligand binding. The increased stability caused by co-activator binding promotes AR activity (19Heinlein C.A. Chang C. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 175-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar, 25Yeh S. Chang C.

Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 287-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Lastly, the TRAP/mediator complexes enhance ligand-dependent AR activity, likely through direct recruitment of RNA polymerase II (27Wang Q. Sharma D. Ren Y. Fondell J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42852-42858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Several other cofactors have been identified, but the mechanisms by which they modulate AR activity have yet to be determined. For several transcription factors, including selected nuclear receptors, the SWI/SNF ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complexes have been implicated in target gene regulation (28Yoshinaga S.K.

The SWI/SNF family encompasses a number of large, multisubunit complexes comprising eight or more proteins. Invariantly, the SWI/SNF complex contains one of two core ATPases, BRG1 or hBRM. These complexes regulate the activity of transcription factors by re-organizing chromatin structure through either facilitating nucleosome condensation (which induces transcriptional repression) or nucleosome dispersion (assisting in transcriptional activation) (38Tyler J.K.

Loss of SWI/SNF activity abrogates RB-mediated transcriptional repression and the ability of RB to arrest cellular proliferation. In contrast, RB enhances association of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) with either BRG1 or hBRM, thus resulting in increased GR activity (51Bourachot B. Yaniv M. Muchardt C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3931-3939Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 52Singh P. Coe J. Hong W. Nature. 1995; 374: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 53Singh P. Chan S.W. Hong W. J. Biol.

The association between BRG1 or hBRM and GR is known to be direct, and recruitment of SWI/SNF complexes to GR may actually stimulate displacement of GR from chromatin, allowing GR to return to the remodeled chromatin with additional transcription factors (30Fletcher T.M. Xiao N. Mautino G. Baumann C.T. Wolford R. Warren B.S. Hager G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3255-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Even though SWI/SNF activity clearly is necessary to repress RB targets and activate GR targets, both events can induce a cessation of cellular proliferation (cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis) (44Strobeck M.W.

Collectively, these observations contribute to the current hypothesis that the SWI/SNF complex can interact with sequence specific transcription factors to either promote or repress target gene activation, dependent on promoter context and complex content. In addition to the GR, SWI/SNF activity has been shown to be essential for estrogen receptor, ERα, activity. ERα fails to activate estrogen-responsive elements in SWI/SNF-defective cells, as demonstrated by transient reporter assay. Using this same system, ERα activity was restored upon co-expression of BRG1 (33Ichinose H. Garnier J.M. Chambon P. Losson R. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 188: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 34DiRenzo J. Shang Y. Phelan M. Sif S. Myers M. Kingston R. Brown M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 7541-7549Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The hypothesis that ERα requires BRG1 activity was further substantiated by the observations that BRG1 can be detected at endogenous ER target promoters in the presence of ligand and that a BRG1-associated factor, BAF57, enhances ERα/SRC-1 activation of estrogen-responsive promoters (35Belandia B. Orford R.L. Hurst H.C. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4094-4103Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Presumably, such induction of ER activity contributes to ER signaling and ER-dependent proliferation in mammary epithelia and carcinoma cells. Here, we probed the importance of SWI/SNF activity for AR function. We show that complete ligand-dependent activation of two distinct AR target promoters (PSA and probasin) requires SWI/SNF function. For PSA, SWI/SNF activity was essential, whereas for probasin low level activation was observed in the absence of SWI/SNF, indicating that this target can be at least partially activated independently of chromatin remodeling. Both core promoters were strongly stimulated by the restoration of hBRM. The re-introduction of BRG1 weakly activated the probasin promoter but was unable to stimulate the transcription of the PSA promoter by the AR. We also demonstrate that an ER-responsive promoter can be equally activated by either BRG1 or hBRM. These data suggest a strong preference for hBRM as the core ATPase for AR activity. Lastly, we report that the addition of a distal enhancer region to the proximal promoters relieved SWI/SNF dependence for PSA but did not impact the probasin promoter in remodeling-dependent target promoters. Thus, upstream elements can influence the requirement of SWI/SNF factors for AR action. Collectively, the data contained herein establish a role for hBRM-containing SWI/SNF complexes on AR activity. Moreover, these data demonstrate a role of enhancer regions in controlling the SWI/SNF requirement and reveal a disparity in AR target promoters with regard to the chromatin-remodeling requirement.

The CMV-β-galactosidase construct was the gift of Dr. Jean Wang (University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA). The PSA61-luc reporter was kindly provided by Dr. Kitty Cleutjens (Erasmus Universiteit, Netherlands) and has been previously described (55Cleutjens K.B. van der Korput H.A. van Eekelen C.C. van Rooij H.C.

The pCG-hBRM plasmid was given to us by Dr. M. Yaniv (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France) (29Muchardt C. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4279-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). The pBabe-dnBRG1 was a gift from Dr. B. Weissman (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). pBS3X-ERE-luc and pCMV5-hERα were kindly provided by Dr. S. Khan (University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH). Probasin-luc (ARR2-luc) was constructed from ARR2-PB, a gift of Dr. R. Matusik (Vanderbilt University) (57Zhang J. Thomas T.Z. Kasper S. Matusik R.J. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4698-4710Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Briefly, ARR2-PB (57Zhang J. Thomas T.Z. Kasper S. Matusik R.J. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4698-4710Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) was digested with KpnI and BamHI. The probasin fragment was subcloned into the KpnI and BglII sites in pGL2-Basic. PSA-luc was provided by Dr. A. Puga (University of Cincinnati) and was generated by digesting PSA61-luc (55Cleutjens K.B. van der Korput H.A. van Eekelen C.C. van Rooij H.C. Faber P.W. Trapman J. Mol Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 148-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) with BglII and HindIII. The PSA promoter was inserted into the BglII and HindIII sites in pGL3-Basic (Promega). ARR2+E-luc was constructed by inserting of the 1.3-kb EcoRV fragment of the PSA enhancer into the SmaI site of ARR2-luc. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). β-Tubulin, BRG1, and hBRM antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). CD44 antibody was a gift from Dr. L. Sherman (Oregon Health Sciences, Portland, OR). Cell Culture and Treatment—SW13, C33A, and CV1 cell lines were obtained from ATCC and maintained in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. SW13, C33A, and CV1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, Atlanta Biologicals, Norcross, GA), 2 mm l-glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Mediatech, Herndon, VA). For SW13, C33A, and CV1 reporter assays, 10% charcoal dextran-treated FBS (CDT, HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT) and phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were utilized. Transfection and Reporter Assays—SW13, C33A, and CV1 cells were transfected in charcoal dextran-treated (CDT) serum, which lacks steroid hormones, with the indicated plasmid constructs using the BES/calcium phosphate protocol (58Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). 0.75 μg of receptor expression plasmid (SG5-AR or ERα), 0.5 μg of reporter construct (ARR2-luc, PSA-luc, PSA61-luc, ARR2+E-luc, or 3X-ERE-luc), 2.65 μg of either pBJ5-BRG1 or pCG-hBRM, 0.1 μg of CMV-β-galactosidase, and empty vector (pcDNA3.1) to a total of 4 μg were transfected for each well of a 6-well dish. Following the transfection, the cells were washed with sterile phosphate-buffered saline. SW13, C33A, or CV1 cells were then allowed to recover for a period of 5–6 h and then supplemented with 0.1 nm DHT (Sigma) or 0.1% ethanol vehicle (EtOH) for 20–24 h. Following stimulation, cells were harvested and luciferase activity was quantified using the Promega luciferase assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI). β-Galactosidase activity was used as an internal control for transfection efficiency and was measured utilizing the manufacturer's recommended protocol for the Galacto-Star kit (Tropix, Bedford, MA). Basal activity (in the presence of ethanol vehicle) was set to “1,” and relative luciferase activity is shown. Experiments were performed at least in triplicate. Averages and standard deviations are shown. Immunoblotting—1 × 105 C33A cells were seeded into a 6-cm dish. The cells were then transfected with 8 μg of either pcDNA 3.1, pBJ5-BRG1, or pCG-hBRM plasmid for 12 h via BES/calcium phosphate. The cells were then washed with sterile phosphate-buffered saline. After 16 h, the cells were trypsinized and pelleted. The cell pellet was lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture containing 10 μg/ml 1,10-phenanthroline, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysis of cells proceeded on ice for 10 min. After brief sonication, lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g, 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was quantified by using a DC protein assay (Bio-Rad), and 30 μg of total protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). The membrane was immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies via standard techniques, and antibodies were detected using Western Lightning chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA). The Proximal Probasin Promoter Retains Minimal Activity in the Absence of BRG1 or hBRM—It has been previously demonstrated that the SWI/SNF complex is necessary for the function of several nuclear receptors. For example, estrogen receptor and glucocorticoid receptor activity is absent or significantly decreased, respectively, in cell lines that are deficient in BRG1 and hBRM, the core ATPase proteins of the SWI/SNF complex. Receptor activity can be rescued through restoration of BRG1 (29Muchardt C. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4279-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 32Chiba H. Muramatsu M. Nomoto A. Kato H.

Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 7541-7549Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). SW13 and C33A cells are defective in both BRG1 and hBRM, and are known to lack SWI/SNF activity (29Muchardt C. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4279-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 59Decristofaro M.F. Betz B.L. Rorie C.J. Reisman D.N. Wang W. Weissman B.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 186: 136-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). To compare, spontaneously immortalized CV1 cells, which express both BRG1 and hBRM (data not shown) were also utilized. As shown in Fig. 1A, CV1 and SW13 cells were transfected with plasmid encoding the estrogen receptor (ERα) and CMV-β-galactosidase (as an internal control for transfection efficiency), and the 3X-ERE-luc reporter construct. ERα activated the ERE reporter 4.9-fold in the presence of 10 nm 17β-estradiol (E2) (left panel). In contrast, addition of 10 nm E2 failed to activate the 3X-ERE-luc reporter in SW13 cells (right panel). These observations are consistent with previous reports demonstrating the requirement of SWI/SNF for ERα activity (34DiRenzo J. Shang Y. Phelan M. Sif S. Myers M. Kingston R. Brown M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 7541-7549Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). To determine if the AR requires the SWI/SNF complex for transactivation, similar experiments were performed. Briefly, SWI/SNF-competent (CV1) or -defective (SW13 and C33A) cells were cultured for 24 h in the absence of steroid hormone (phenol red-free media supplemented with 10% CDT). Cells were then transfected with plasmid encoding the androgen receptor (pSG5-AR), CMV-β-galactosidase, and the ARR2-luc reporter plasmid at the amounts indicated. ARR2-luc is a well characterized, AR-specific reporter construct that contains two copies of the probasin promoter in tandem and directs prostate-specific expression in transgenic mouse models (57Zhang J. Thomas T.Z. Kasper S. Matusik R.J. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4698-4710Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Post-transfection, cells were treated with vehicle (0.1% ethanol) or physiological levels of androgen (0.1 nm DHT) for 20–24 h. Cells were then harvested and processed to detect luciferase and β-galactosidase activity. As can be seen in Fig. 1B, the probasin promoter was induced 138.0-fold by androgen in CV1 cells (left panel) but only 6.6- and 10.0-fold in SWI/SNF-defective SW13 and C33A cells, respectively (middle and right panels). This significant reduction in activity is comparable to that observed with GR in C33A and SW13 cells (29Muchardt C. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4279-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Thus, the AR exhibits significant deficiency in activating the probasin promoter in the absence of core SWI/SNF activity. AR-dependent Activation of the Probasin Promoter Is Induced by the Restoration of BRG1 but Preferentially by hBRM—It has been previously shown that SWI/SNF activity can be restored in SW13 and C33A cells through ectopic expression of BRG1 or hBRM. For example, CD44 expression is lost in BRG1/hBRM-deficient cell lines. The expression of CD44 expression can be restored by transfecting either BRG1 or hBRM into these cells (SW13 or C33A) (44Strobeck M.W. DeCristofaro M.F. Banine F. Weissman B.E. Sherman L.S.

https://openalex.org/W1973744676,"The Ral signaling pathway is critically involved in Ras-dependent oncogenesis. One of its key actors, RLIP/RalBP1, which participates in receptor endocytosis during interphase, is also involved in mitotic processes when endocytosis is switched off. During mitosis, RLIP76 is located on the duplicated centrosomes and is required for their proper separation and movement to the poles. We have looked for actors that associate with RLIP during mitosis. We show here that RLIP/RalBP1 interacts with an active p34cdc2·cyclinB1 (cdk1) enzyme and that this interaction is crucial for the mitotic phosphorylation of Epsin that, once phosphorylated, is no longer competent for endocytosis. We show also that this latter phosphorylation is dependent on Ral signaling. We propose that RLIP/RalBP1 is used as a platform by the mitotic cdk1 to facilitate the phosphorylation of Epsin, which makes Epsin incompetent for endocytosis during mitosis, when endocytosis is switched off.

In physiological signaling as well as in oncogenic transformation, the Ral GTPase is an effector of Ras and is required for transformation (1Urano T. Emkey R. Feig L.A.

Biol. 2001; 21: 5958-5969Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Downstream of Ral, two proteins have been identified as Ral effectors and involve the Ral pathway in trafficking, Sec5 and RLIP76/RalBP1. Sec5 mediates Ral contribution to functioning of the exocyst, and this interaction is critical for basolateral targeting of membrane proteins in polarized cells (6Moskalenko S. Henry D.O. Rosse C. Mirey G. Camonis J.H. White M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 7Polzin A. Shipitsin M. Goi T. Feig L.A. Turner T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1714-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The RLIP76/RalBP1 protein interacts with the POB1/REPS proteins and the adaptin complex AP2, and these latter proteins bind Epsin. These interactions mediate the role of Ral in endocytosis (8Nakashima S. Morinaka K. Koyama S. Ikeda M. Kishida M. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kishida S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3629-3642Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 9Jullien-Flores V. Mahe Y. Mirey G. Leprince C. Meunier-Bisceuil B. Sorkin A. Camonis J.H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2837-2844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During mitosis, a period of the cell cycle devoid of endocytosis (10Pypaert M. Mundy D. Souter E. Labbe J.C. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1159-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), RLIP76, also known as cytocentrin, is found at the centrosome and on spindle microtubules, where it fulfills essential functions, because depletion of RLIP76 leads to monopolar spindles and mitotic catastrophes (11Quaroni A. Paul E.C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 707-718Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The partners of mitotic RLIP76 are not known (11Quaroni A. Paul E.C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 707-718Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus RLIP76 appears as a protein with two faces, one during interphase, one during mitosis, with no functional relationship between these two roles. Pathways downstream of the Ral pathways are conserved in mammals, flies, probably Caenorhabditis elegans, and possibly in all Metazoans. All of the human proteins involved in the pathways downstream and upstream of Ral have an ortholog in Drosophila melanogaster, and these orthologs are networked according to a similar circuitry (12Mirey G. Balakireva M. L'Hoste S. Rossé C. Voegeling S. Camonis J.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1112-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) where d-RLIP is the fly ortholog of human RLIP76/RalBP1 (9Jullien-Flores V. Mahe Y. Mirey G. Leprince C. Meunier-Bisceuil B. Sorkin A. Camonis J.H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2837-2844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Looking for partners of RLIP proteins, we have screened human placenta and Drosophila embryo two-hybrid cDNA libraries with human and fly RLIP as baits, respectively. We show that cyclinB and RLIP interact in vitro as well as in vivo in both species and that RLIP associates with an active cyclinB1·p34cdc2 (cdk1) 1The abbreviations used are: cdk1, cyclin-dependent kinase 1; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; Erk, extracellular signal-regulated kinase. complex. RLIP76 is found in a complex with the endocytotic proteins Numb and Epsin, and this complex, as well as the complex between RLIP76 and AP2, is present both in interphase and during mitosis. Epsin has been shown to be phosphorylated by cdk1 in M phase, which might be related to the absence of endocytosis during mitosis, and this phosphorylation renders Epsin incompetent as a dominant negative molecule on endocytosis (13Kariya K. Koyama S. Nakashima S. Oshiro T. Morinaka K. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18399-18406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We report that RLIP76 interacts in HeLa cells with both the phosphorylated and the non-phosphorylated forms of Epsin and that overexpression of the C terminus of RLIP blocks the phosphorylation of Epsin during mitosis. We propose that, at the onset of G2/M, RLIP proteins function as scaffolds between its interphasic endocytotic partners, including Epsin, and its G2/M partner cdk1. It would correspond to a sensitizer function for enzyme-substrate reaction and would be related to the switching off of endocytosis during mitosis. Surprisingly, blocking Ral signaling has a similar effect on Epsin phosphorylation, which suggests a role for Ral also at the approach of mitosis. Plasmids—For expression of the last 159 amino acids of RLIP76, the coding sequence was amplified using primers gggcggatccctggccatggagcagtttc (forward) and cggcgaattctcagatggacgtctccttcc (reverse) (Invitrogen) and cloned between the BamH1 and EcoR1 sites of pRK5-Myc. Epsin expression plasmid was a gift from Dr. Di Fiore. Myc-tagged Ral binding domain expression plasmids have been described in a previous study (6Moskalenko S. Henry D.O. Rosse C. Mirey G. Camonis J.H. White M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Myc-tagged full-length RLIP76 expression plasmids were generated by subcloning RLIP76 coding sequence in-frame with the 6-myc tag expression region of pCS3-MT (a gift of Dr. D. Turner). Cells and Transfections—HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Schneider S2 cells were cultured in Schneider medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 16.5 mm l-glutamine (Sigma) and 10% fetal bovine serum. HeLa cells were transiently transfected using the calcium phosphate method (14Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). For synchronization, exponentially growing HeLa cells were treated for 12–14 h with nocodazole (5 μg/ml), and plates were shaken mechanically to recover cells in mitosis that attach weakly to the plates. RNA oligonucleotides (21 nucleotides) homologous to RLIP76 were designed as described previously (15Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8186) Google Scholar) and prepared by Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). Oligonucleotides were desalted, deprotected, and annealed according to the manufacturer's instructions and as previously described (15Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8186) Google Scholar). dsRNA oligonucleotide (20 pm) was used for transfection in 100-mm plates. RLIP76 oligonucleotides were 5′-GUAGAGAGGACCAUGAUGUdTdT and 5′-ACAUCAUGGUCCUCUCUACdTdT. siRNAs were transfected with Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's optimized protocol. Biochemistry—Pull-down, immunodepletion, and immunoprecipitation experiments were performed as described (9Jullien-Flores V. Mahe Y. Mirey G. Leprince C. Meunier-Bisceuil B. Sorkin A. Camonis J.H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2837-2844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). cdk1 kinase assay was performed using histone H1 as substrate, according to a previous study (16Jessus C. Rime H. Haccard O. Van Lint J. Goris J. Merlevede W. Ozon R. Development. 1991; 111: 813-820PubMed Google Scholar). When non-radioactive ATP was used, phosphorylated histone H1 was detected using a polyclonal anti-phospho-histone H1 serum (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). Two-hybrid Screening—Two-hybrid screens and assays were carried out using a LexA-based two-hybrid system (17Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar) and yeast strains L40ΔGAL4 (a gift of Drs. P. Legrain and M. Fromont-Racine) or Y187 (Clontech). A 0- to 24-h Drosophila embryo cDNA library was a generous gift of Dr. S. Elledge. Standard techniques in yeast handling were used. Antibodies—The antibodies used in this study were mouse monoclonal anti-myc 9E10 (Roche Applied Science). Monoclonal antibodies to cyclinB1, Numb, and the alpha subunit of adaptin AP2 were purchased from Transduction Laboratories, and a goat polyclonal serum to Epsin1 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies. Drosophila cyclinB was detected using a monoclonal antibody, a gift from Dr. P. Leopold (Nice). Anti-human RLIP76 antibodies have been already described (9Jullien-Flores V. Mahe Y. Mirey G. Leprince C. Meunier-Bisceuil B. Sorkin A. Camonis J.H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2837-2844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-fly RLIP antibodies were generated by immunizing rabbits with GST-RLIP1, and immunoglobulins were recovered by precipitation using 50% ammonium sulfate. Mitotic phospho-Ser/Thr-Pro motifs were detected with MPM2 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). TG3, which detects phospho-nucleolin, was a gift from P. Davis. A Two-hybrid Screen Identifies CyclinB as a Specific Partner of RLIP in Drosophila melanogaster and Homo sapiens— Looking for partners specific of regions of RLIP proteins, we used the last 144 amino acids (of 625 amino acids) of d-RLIP as bait in a two-hybrid screen; among 5 million screened colonies, 11 His+ β-galactosidase+ clones corresponded to cyclinB. We did not identify cyclinB as a prey in any of eight other two-hybrid screens performed on the same library with irrelevant bait proteins, i.e. among 80 millions clones surveyed in various two-hybrid screens. The specificity of the RLIP-cyclinB interaction was further strengthened by the lack of interaction between cyclinB as a prey and various bait proteins (Ral, Ras, RGL, and lamin) (data not shown). CyclinB is composed of 787 amino acids, and all 11 selected clones encoded the GAL4-activation domain fused in-frame with the last 514 amino acids of cyclinB, starting just before the cyclin boxes that bind p34cdc2 (data not shown). We tested whether this interaction is conserved in humans. CyclinB1 was tested in a two-hybrid assay with full-length RLIP76 (the C terminus of RLIP76 autoactivates and therefore cannot be used as a 2H bait) as well as with irrelevant proteins. The results showed that the interaction between cyclinB and RLIP is conserved between Drosophila and humans (data not shown). CyclinB1 Interacts with RLIP76 in Vitro—HeLa cell extracts were prepared either from exponentially growing cells (“E” in Fig. 1) or from a population of cells enriched in mitotic cells (“M” in Fig. 1) by mechanical shake-off of cells pre-treated with nocodazole. Western blot analysis of whole cell extracts showed an increase of cyclinB1 between the exponentially growing cells (E) cells and the mitotic cells (M), validating that the latter population is indeed largely enriched in mitotic cells (Fig. 1). These cell extracts were incubated with GST or with GST-RLIP76 proteins bound to glutathione beads. Proteins bound to the column were analyzed by Western blot with anti-cyclinB1 antibodies. Fig. 1 shows that cyclinB1 binds specifically to GST-RLIP76. CyclinB1 and RLIP76 Interact in Vivo—To assess whether the two proteins actually interact in vivo, we submitted protein extracts from exponentially growing cells (E) and from mitotic cells (M) to immunoprecipitation with anti-RLIP76 antibodies, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed for the presence of cyclinB1 by Western blotting. Fig. 2A shows that cyclinB1 co-immunoprecipitates with RLIP76, whereas non-immune rabbit IgG used as a negative control precipitated neither RLIP76 nor cyclinB1. Conversely, immunoprecipitation with anti-cyclinB1 antibodies could not lead to detect RLIP76 in the immunoprecipitate, probably because only a fraction of cyclinB1 is complexed to RLIP76. To further validate the specificity of this immunoprecipitation, the serum was preincubated with GST or GST-RLIP76 (the anti-RLIP76 serum was obtained by immunizing rabbits with an MBP-RLIP76 fusion protein (9Jullien-Flores V. Mahe Y. Mirey G. Leprince C. Meunier-Bisceuil B. Sorkin A. Camonis J.H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2837-2844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). Preincubation with GST-RLIP considerably reduced the amount of immunoprecipitated cyclinB1, as opposed to preincubation with GST alone (Fig. 2B, upper panel). Two-hybrid assays had suggested that the interaction between RLIP and cyclinB is conserved in flies and human. We tested this conservation using cell extracts from exponentially growing Schneider cells. Whereas pre-immune serum used as a control immunoprecipitated neither d-RLIP nor fly cyclinB, antibodies raised against d-RLIP immunoprecipitated cyclinB together with d-RLIP (Fig. 2C), hence confirming in vivo the conservation of this interaction. Because cyclinB1 is a component of the cdk1 kinase holoenzyme, we tested whether RLIP76 interacts with cyclinB1 alone or complexed to p34cdc2. Cdk1 activity is assessed conventionally by the in vitro phosphorylation of histone H1 and is maximal in mitotic cell extracts (16Jessus C. Rime H. Haccard O. Van Lint J. Goris J. Merlevede W. Ozon R. Development. 1991; 111: 813-820PubMed Google Scholar). Cell extracts prepared from exponentially growing cells and mechanically shaken mitotic cells were incubated with beads bound to p13, GST, or GST-RLIP76. p13 binds cyclinB and constitutes a positive control (Fig. 3). No H1 kinase activity was pulled-down from exponentially growing cell extracts either with GST-RLIP76 or with p13. As opposed to GST, GST-RLIP76 pulled down a strong H1 kinase activity from mitotic cell extracts (Fig. 3). This activity was also immunoprecipitated, only from mitotic cell extracts, with anti-RLIP76 antibodies (Fig. 2B, lower panel), and its level was considerably lower when the serum had been depleted by incubation with GST-RLIP but not with GST (Fig. 2B, lower panel). All together, these results show that RLIP76 associates with the active cdk1 holoenzyme. Finally, we verified that the phosphorylation of histone H1 obtained with mitotic cell extracts immunoprecipitated with anti-RLIP76 antibodies was indeed due to cdk1. The same experiment as described in Fig. 2B was performed again except that non-radioactive ATP was used in the kinase assay. Histone H1 phosphorylation was tested by Western blot using a serum that detects phospho-residues phosphorylated by cdk1 on histone H1. Fig. 3B shows that the signal with this serum is strongly increased in mitotic cell extracts immunoprecipitated with anti-RLIP76 antibodies, strengthening our suggestion that a bona fide cdk1 activity is bound to RLIP76 during mitosis. We questioned the fate of endocytotic complexes containing RLIP76 in mitosis when RLIP76 interacts with cdk1. RLIP76 forms a complex with AP2 and POB1/REPS, and these latter proteins interact with Epsin (9Jullien-Flores V. Mahe Y. Mirey G. Leprince C. Meunier-Bisceuil B. Sorkin A. Camonis J.H. J.

AP2 and Eps15 interact with each other as well as with Numb, a protein involved in endocytosis and in asymmetric division of Drosophila neuroblasts (19Santolini E. Puri C. Salcini A.E. Gagliani M.C.

Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1541-1551PubMed Google Scholar). RLIP was reported to be in a complex with Epsin, and Fig. 4A shows that both AP2 and Numb were co-immunoprecipitated with RLIP76. Preincubating the anti-RLIP serum with GST-RLIP76 decreased the level of both RLIP76 and Numb in the immunoprecipitate (data not shown), as it had been shown for AP2 (9Jullien-Flores V. Mahe Y. Mirey G. Leprince C. Meunier-Bisceuil B. Sorkin A. Camonis J.H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2837-2844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). siRNAs against RLIP76 efficiently knocked-down the amount of RLIP76 without affecting the level of AP2 and Numb in whole cell extracts (Fig. 4A). In HeLa cells transfected with siRLIP76, immunoprecipitation with anti-RLIP76 antibodies showed a strong decrease of Numb and AP2 in the “immunoprecipitate” (Fig. 4A). This interaction between RLIP and Numb is also conserved between human and flies, as is the interaction between RLIP and mu2, the medium chain of the AP2 complex (9Jullien-Flores V. Mahe Y. Mirey G. Leprince C. Meunier-Bisceuil B. Sorkin A. Camonis J.H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2837-2844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 4B). Although RLIP is involved in endocytosis, it has its own function during mitosis. We investigated whether endocytotic complexes containing RLIP76 remained present during mitosis. Fig. 4C shows that, although there is a smaller amount of RLIP76 in whole cell extracts from mitotic cells, Numb and AP2 were found in RLIP immunoprecipitates, showing that complexes between RLIP76 and Numb, as well as between RLIP76 and AP2, are cell cycle-independent. Epsin associates with POB1 and AP2 and is a substrate of the p34cdc2 kinase (13Kariya K. Koyama S. Nakashima S. Oshiro T. Morinaka K. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18399-18406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 21Chen H. Slepnev V.I. Di Fiore P.P. De Camilli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3257-3260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We questioned whether RLIP76, via its interaction with cyclinB, was critical for the mitotic phosphorylation of Epsin by cdk1. In exponentially growing cells, Epsin was present in an anti-RLIP immunoprecipitate, but during mitosis, when less RLIP was immunoprecipitated, Epsin could barely be detected (Fig. 4C). Yet both proteins were actually able to interact in mitotic cells, as evidenced by their co-immunoprecipitation from exponentially growing as well as mitotic cells that have been transiently transfected with expression vectors encoding RLIP76 and Epsin (Fig. 5). Moreover, as expected, in mitotic cells, Epsin was found present as two species with the slower migrating form resulting from its phosphorylation by p34cdc2 (13Kariya K. Koyama S. Nakashima S. Oshiro T. Morinaka K. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18399-18406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and both were co-immunoprecipitated with RLIP. In ex vivo experiments, the affinity between AP2 and Epsin is decreased when Epsin is phosphorylated by p34cdc2 from Xenopus or CHO mitotic cell extracts (13Kariya K. Koyama S. Nakashima S. Oshiro T.

Chem. 1999; 274: 3257-3260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In pull-down experiments with CHO cell extracts, the affinity of phosphorylated Epsin for POB1 is also decreased (13Kariya K. Koyama S. Nakashima S. Oshiro T. Morinaka K. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18399-18406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). An inference of these results would be that Epsin should display an lower interaction with RLIP during mitosis than during interphase. However, Fig. 5 shows that in HeLa cells RLIP76 interacts similarly with cdk1-phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated Epsin. We investigated also whether mitotic HeLa cells also displayed a reduced interaction between AP2 and Epsin as compared with exponentially growing cells. As shown in Fig. 6, all of the endogenous Epsin from mitotic cells exhibited the mobility shift characteristic of its phosphorylation by p34cdc2; yet similar levels of AP2 were found in Epsin immunoprecipitates from mitotic and interphase cells.Fig. 6Epsin forms a cell cycle-independent complex with AP2. Protein extracts from mitotic cells (M) and from exponentially growing cells (E) were immunoprecipitated with anti-Epsin antibodies, and immunoprecipitates were probed for the presence of Epsin and AP2 (alpha chain).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We couldn't use an siRNA approach to work out the RLIP-Epsin association, because knocking down RLIP76 led to a decrease of Epsin in whole cell extracts, a result that would suggest that a large fraction of Epsin is complexed to and stabilized by its interaction with RLIP (data not shown). cdk1 phosphorylates Epsin that is found in a complex with RLIP76 that binds cyclinB/p34cdc2. We tested the hypothesis that RLIP76 is a scaffolding protein that brings together the enzyme, cdk1, and its substrate, Epsin. It is noteworthy that phosphorylation by cdk1 of several proteins involved in endocytosis is concomitant with the shut-off of endocytosis during M phase. The observation that a mutant of Epsin mimicking its phosphorylation by cdk1 is no longer able to interfere with endocytosis, as opposed to wild-type Epsin (13Kariya K. Koyama S. Nakashima S. Oshiro T. Morinaka K. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18399-18406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), is consistent with the hypothesis that the phosphorylation of these proteins would prevent them from performing endocytotic functions during mitosis. The “scaffold” hypothesis was tested by investigating whether the C-terminal region of RLIP76 that corresponds to the region of RLIP that interacts with cyclinB (amino acids 497–655 of d-RLIP) behaves as a dominant negative mutant and blocks Epsin phosphorylation by cdk1 in mitosis. We overexpressed transiently the C terminus of RLIP tagged with a myc epitope. We also overexpressed Epsin, because this gives a clearer view of Epsin mobility shift upon its phosphorylation by cdk1. Fig. 7 shows that overexpressed Epsin displayed a characteristic mobility shift in mitotic HeLa cells. Overexpression of these proteins, alone or together, failed to impair the entry of cells in M phase, as witnessed by the increase in cyclinB1 in cell extracts. However, expression of the C terminus of RLIP76 totally inhibited the mitotic shift of Epsin, hence, its phosphorylation by cdk1; the unique band migrated at the same molecular weight as interphasic Epsin, and the amount are around the sum of the two bands seen in mitosis. The alpha subunit of AP2 also displayed a mitotic shift most probably due to its phosphorylation by a kinase different from cdk1 (13Kariya K. Koyama S. Nakashima S. Oshiro T. Morinaka K. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18399-18406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar); this shift was not affected by expression of the C terminus of RLIP76 (data not shown). To address the question of the specificity of the effect of the C terminus of RLIP76 upon the phosphorylation of Epsin, we tested whole mitotic cell extracts with MPM2, a monoclonal antibody that recognizes mitotic phosphoserines and phosphothreonines (13Kariya K.

Rao P.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2926-2930Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Fig. 8A shows that there was no difference between control cells and cells transfected with the C terminus of RLIP76 or the Ral-binding domain of RLIP76 for all three proteins. Roughly the phospho-pattern in mitotic cells were not modified in conditions where phosphorylation of Epsin is inhibited. Nucleolin is another substrate of cdk1 (23Peter M. Nakagawa J. Doree M. Labbe J.C. Nigg E.A. Cell. 1990; 60: 791-801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), and the TG3 antibody (24Dranovsky A. Vincent I. Gregori L. Schwarzman A. Colflesh D. Enghild J. Strittmatter W. Davies P. Goldgaber D. Neurobiol. Aging. 2001; 22: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) specifically recognizes nucleolin phosphorylated by cdk1. Fig. 8A shows that neither the C terminus of RLIP76 nor the Ral-binding domain prevented the phosphorylation of nucleolin. CyclinB1 was equivalent in all cell extracts, showing that cells were correctly synchronized. Erk was used as a loading control. Fig. 8B shows that, in mitotic cells, there was no difference in the amount of p34cdc2, detected with an anti-PSTAIRE, whether the cells were expressing or not the C terminus of RLIP76. Finally, cdk1 activity measured by a histone H1 kinase assay displayed no difference related to the expression of full-length RLIP76 or the C terminus of RLIP76 as compared with control cells (Fig. 8C). These results confirm that mitosis proceeds while the C terminus of RLIP76 is overexpressed, that global cdk1 activity is not altered, and that the effect observed on the cdk1 phosphorylation of Epsin is specific.Fig. 8RLIP76 is not required for cdk1 activity. A, HeLa cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing the C terminus of RLIP76 or the Ral binding of Sec5. Cell extracts from mitotic cells (M) and from exponentially growing cells (E) were immunoblotted and tested for mitotic phosphorylation (MPM2), cyclinB1, phosphorylation of nucleolin, and Erk1/2 as a loading control. B, same experiment as in A. Cell extracts were tested for the amount of p34cdc2 with an anti-PSTAIRE antibody. C, cell extracts from mitotic cells (M) expressing RLIP76 or its C terminus were incubated with beads loaded with p13. After extensive washing, beads were incubated with histone H1 (3 μg) and [γ-32P]ATP, and histone H1 phosphorylation was detected by autoradiography after SDS-PAGE.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because RLIP76 is an effector of the Ral GTPase, we wondered whether Ral signaled to cdk1 via RLIP76. We overexpressed the Ral binding domain of RLIP that blocks Ral signaling (6Moskalenko S. Henry D.O. Rosse C. Mirey G. Camonis J.H. White M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 25De Ruiter N.D. Burgering B.M. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8225-8235Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and investigated its effect on the phosphorylation of Epsin in mitotic cells. Fig. 7 shows that, although blocking Ral signaling did not impair entry in mitosis (cyclinB is normally increased), it indeed inhibited Epsin phosphorylation, while expression of full-length RLIP76 had no effect (Fig. 7B). A similar effect was obtained by expressing another Ral binding domain, from Sec5 (6Moskalenko S. Henry D.O. Rosse C. Mirey G. Camonis J.H. White M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Several interphasic processes are stopped when cells undergo mitosis, and these resume late in mitosis or at the next G1 cycle. Such is the case for endocytosis, although it is not clear whether endocytosis must stop for mitosis to proceed or whether the absence of endocytosis is a physical consequence of the mitotic process. In cells undergoing mitosis, coated pit invagination is inhibited in vitro by cdk1 (10Pypaert M. Mundy D. Souter E. Labbe J.C. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1159-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and several molecules involved in endocytosis are phosphorylated by the M-phase cdk1 kinase. This phosphorylation is supposed to modify substrate subcellular localization (26van der Sluijs P. Hull M. Huber L.A. Male P. Goud B. Mellman I.

It plays a role in the endocytosis of transmembrane receptors (8Nakashima S. Morinaka K. Koyama S. Ikeda M. Kishida M. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kishida S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3629-3642Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 9Jullien-Flores V. Mahe Y. Mirey G. Leprince C. Meunier-Bisceuil B. Sorkin A. Camonis J.H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2837-2844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At the onset of mitosis, cdk1 phosphorylates POB1 and Epsin, with no apparent consequence for the former. Phosphorylated Epsin was shown to loose its capacity to bind POB1 and AP2 (13Kariya K. Koyama S. Nakashima S. Oshiro T. Morinaka K. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18399-18406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 21Chen H. Slepnev V.I. Di Fiore P.P. De Camilli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3257-3260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). RLIP76 itself is not a target of cdk1 (13Kariya K. Koyama S. Nakashima S. Oshiro T. Morinaka K. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18399-18406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). RLIP76/RalBP1 plays a pivotal role by providing a link between the Ras signaling machinery that transduces extracellular signals and the machinery involved in endocytosis. Signal transduction from Ras to RLIP proceeds via RalGEFs and the Ral GTPases. This Ral signaling module was shown to be involved in receptor endocytosis (8Nakashima S. Morinaka K. Koyama S. Ikeda M. Kishida M. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kishida S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3629-3642Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 9Jullien-Flores V. Mahe Y. Mirey G. Leprince C. Meunier-Bisceuil B. Sorkin A. Camonis J.H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2837-2844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that all of the protein-protein interactions converging to or diverging from RLIP are conserved between flies and humans (12Mirey G. Balakireva M. L'Hoste S. Rossé C. Voegeling S. Camonis J.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1112-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In mitotic cells, RLIP76 is found at the centrosome where it is required for separation of the duplicated centrosomes (11Quaroni A. Paul E.C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 707-718Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a search for partners of RLIP76 and more specifically for partners involved in RLIP function during mitosis, a yeast two-hybrid screen and subsequent two-hybrid assays revealed that cyclinB protein interacts with both fly and human RLIP proteins. These interactions were confirmed in vivo with endogenous proteins. We also show that RLIP76 associates with a catalytically active cyclinB·p34cdc2(cdk1) complex. This is consistent with the fact that in cells almost all cylinB1 is complexed with p34cdc2 whereas some free inactive p34cdc2 kinase is present. To shed light on the functional relationship between endocytotic complexes and the interaction between RLIP76 and cdk1, we tested the cell cycle dependence of the association between RLIP76 and its partners involved in trafficking. We found that RLIP76 can be immunoprecipitated together with Epsin, Numb, and AP2 during interphase as well as during mitosis. Reciprocally, Epsin can be precipitated together with AP2 independently of the phase of the cell cycle. These data differ from those published in two other studies: (i) in brain extracts treated with Xenopus mitotic extracts, Epsin looses affinity for AP2 (21Chen H. Slepnev V.I. Di Fiore P.P. De Camilli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3257-3260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar); (ii) pull-down experiments with CHO cells show that overexpressed Epsin looses its affinity for the alpha subunit of AP2, during mitosis and that the AP2-Epsin interaction displays a lower stability in mitosis versus in interphase (13Kariya K. Koyama S. Nakashima S. Oshiro T. Morinaka K. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18399-18406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We don't know the reasons for this difference, except that the cell types are not the same. We show also that the C-terminal region of RLIP76, equivalent to the region of d-RLIP that interacts with cyclinB and POB1, behaves as a dominant negative mutant that inhibits the mitotic phosphorylation of Epsin. These results suggest the existence of a connection that brings together cdk1 and its substrate Epsin via their interactions with RLIP76. We questioned whether the Ral-RLIP76 signaling cascade was involved in this mitotic function of RLIP76. Because both a dominant active (Ral G23V) as well as a dominant negative (Ral S25N) allele of Ral led to cell death upon nocodazole treatment (data not shown), we blocked Ral signaling by overexpressing the Ral binding domain of RLIP76 (Fig. 7) or Sec5 (not shown). Both situations led to a block of Epsin phosphorylation, although cell cycle progression reflected by the increase in cyclinB1 level in G2/M was normal, as was the amount of p34cdc2 as well as cdk1 activity, measured by a histone H1 kinase assay, and reflected by nucleolin phosphorylation and the global mitotic phospho-pattern. The fact that the same effect was observed by expressing either of these Ral binding domains strongly argues that Epsin phosphorylation requires Ral signaling. We propose that RLIP76/RalBP1 serves as a scaffold protein that brings together proteins forming an endocytotic complex during interphase and cdk1 to switch off endocytosis. One of its substrates would be Epsin; phosphorylated Epsin has lost its capacity to be competent for endocytosis as suggested by its inability to block endocytosis when overexpressed, as opposed to unphosphorylated Epsin (13Kariya K. Koyama S. Nakashima S. Oshiro T. Morinaka K. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18399-18406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Whether the role of RLIP76 as a scaffold for the phosphorylation of Epsin by cyclinB·p34cdc2 could be extended to some other proteins binding directly or indirectly RLIP is under investigation. The capacity of RLIP76 to facilitate phosphorylation of Epsin by cdk1 appears dependent on Ral signaling. This might be due to a destabilization of the RLIP-Epsin complex, which would also point to the matchmaking function of RLIP, in order for Epsin to become phosphorylated by cdk1. Alternatively, it might be due to a stabilizing effect of Ral-GTP, once bound to RLIP, on the cdk1·RLIP76 complex. This would point to the requirement of some Ral signaling during G2/M to switch off endocytosis, in contrast to the proposed requirement of Ral activation for the endocytosis of activated receptors during interphase. Finally, we have shown that RLIP is also complexed with Numb, a protein involved together with p34cdc2 in the asymmetric division of fly neuroblasts (31Tio M. Udolph G. Yang X. Chia W. Nature. 2001; 409: 1063-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), a process where AP2 was recently also found involved (32Berdnik D. Torok T. Gonzalez-Gaitan M. Knoblich J.A. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that, despite the presence of a conserved consensus cdk1 phosphorylation site in both fly and human Numb, we failed to phosphorylate immunoprecipitated human Numb with a mitotic cell extract pulled-down with p13 (data not shown). However, the complex formed by RLIP, cdk1, Numb, and AP2 might be the place where these proteins meet to play their parts in asymmetric division. Is there any other role for an association between RLIP and cdk1? RLIP76 is also found associated with spindle microtubules (11Quaroni A. Paul E.C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 707-718Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a target for cdk1 bound to RLIP could be the microtubule network where MAP2 and MAP4 are phosphorylated by cdk1 (29Kitazawa H. Iida J. Uchida A. Haino-Fukushima K. Itoh T.J. Hotani H. Ookata K. Murofushi H. Bulinski J.C. Kishimoto T. Hisanaga S. Cell Struct.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12574-12582Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) with a subsequent inhibition of their microtubule-stabilizing and -nucleation activity. It has not escaped our notice that this molecular function of RLIP proteins and of Ral might also be used during mitosis. RLIP and cdk1 are both present on mitotic centrosomes where RLIP might bring together cdk1 and substrates that require phosphorylation to be active during spindle pole separation, a process where both cdk1 and RLIP76 are implicated. p13 was a gift from Dr. C.

Contrary to general belief, our data show that newly absorbed cholesterol is neither immediately available for secretion with apoB lipoproteins nor exclusively secreted as part of chylomicrons. Based on our data, cholesterol transport by enterocytes can be broadly classified into two independently modulated, apoB-dependent and -independent, pathways. Cholesterol secretion by the apoB-dependent pathway is induced by oleic acid, is repressed by microsomal triglyceride transfer protein inhibitors, and occurs only with larger apoB-containing lipoproteins. ApoB-independent pathways do not require microsomal triglyceride transfer protein and involve efflux mediated by ABCA1, high density lipoprotein assembly, and possibly other unknown mechanisms. There are at least two different metabolic pools of cholesterol. The newly absorbed and pre-absorbed cholesterol are preferentially secreted via apoB-independent and apoB-dependent pathways, respectively. In contrast to compartmentalization for secretion, these two metabolic pools are equally accessible for cellular esterification. The esterified cholesterol is mainly secreted by the apoB-dependent pathway, whereas both the pathways are involved in the secretion of free cholesterol. Thus, enterocytes transport exogenous cholesterol by several independently regulated pathways raising the possibility that targeting of apoB-independent pathways may result in selective inhibition of cholesterol transport without affecting triglyceride transport.

From these studies, it was established that the dietary cholesterol esters are hydrolyzed in the intestinal lumen, and free cholesterol is solubilized in the bile salt micelles and is taken up by intestinal epithelial cells (2Wilson M.D. Rudel L.L. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 943-955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Phan C.T. Tso P. Front Biosci. 2001; 6: D299-D319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Tso P. Karlstad M.D. Bistrian B.R.

Currently, it is believed that the uptake of cholesterol by the enterocytes is the rate-limiting step in cholesterol absorption (7Dawson P.A. Rudel L.L. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1999; 10: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This is supported by the observation that a man who ate 25 eggs a day did not develop hypercholesterolemia because he absorbed less cholesterol (8Kern Jr., F. N. Engl. J. Med. 1991; 324: 896-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). After uptake, enterocytes esterify cholesterol, a process mediated by acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferases (9Chang T.Y. Chang C.C. Cheng D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 613-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 10Chang T.Y. Chang C.C. Lin S. Yu C. Li B.L. Miyazaki A. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), and package it into chylomicrons for basolateral secretion into the mesenteric lymph. The major sources of cholesterol for absorption are of exogenous and endogenous origins. The exogenous source of cholesterol is food, whereas endogenous cholesterol is derived from bile, desquamated cells, and biosynthesis. Endogenous cholesterol, especially biliary cholesterol, enters the intestinal lumen in association with bile salts and is immediately available for absorption. On the other hand, there is a time delay for the absorption of dietary cholesterol because it needs to be solubilized in bile salt micelles. The differences observed in the metabolism of biliary and dietary cholesterol have been explained based on the differences in the solubilization and uptake (2Wilson M.D. Rudel L.L. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 943-955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that after entering the cells these two pools are handled differently. The intracellular mechanisms for cholesterol packaging in chylomicrons are poorly understood because most of the animal studies involve measurement of radiolabeled cholesterol in the feces and thoracic duct lymph or blood. Recent advances in cellular models to study intestinal lipid absorption have resulted in newer attempts toward the understanding of cholesterol absorption by enterocytes. In this regards, Field and co-workers (11Chen H. Born E. Mathur S.N. Johlin Jr., F.C. Field F.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 771-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 12Field F.J. Born E. Mathur S.N. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 2651-2660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that Caco-2 cells preferentially secrete plasma membrane cholesterol along with triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and that this secretion is modulated by sphingomyelinase. The plasma membrane cholesterol is transported to the endoplasmic reticulum by intracellular vesicles, a process stimulated by oleic acid (13Field F.J. Born E. Chen H. Murthy S. Mathur S.N. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1533-1543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and is replenished by cholesterol obtained from luminal absorption or cellular biosynthesis. We studied the mechanisms involved in the transport of cholesterol, and we observed that intestinal cells compartmentalize absorbed cholesterol and secrete by several mechanisms.

Lipids. 1997; 32: 1113-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-apoA-1 antibody, 4H1, was from Dr. Yves Marcel of the University of Ottawa Heart Institute. Polyclonal anti-apoA-1 antibodies were from Roche Applied Science. Glyburide, 9-cis-retinoic acid, 22-hydroxycholesterol, oleic acid (OA), monopalmitoylglycerol, sodium cholate, sodium deoxycholate, and taurocholate (TC) were from Sigma. Phosphatidylcholine was from Avanti Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Microsomal triglyceride transfer activity (MTP) inhibitor, BMS200150, was a kind gift from Dr. Haris Jamil of the Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. To prepare OA:TC (20 × 1.6:0.5 mm) stocks, 97.4 mg of sodium oleate were added to 10 ml of 10 mm TC solution, mixed by swirling, and incubated at 37 °C until a clear solution was obtained. This stock was filtered (0.2 μm) and stored (–20 °C) in 1-ml batches until use. To prepare micelles for incubation with primary rat enterocytes, lipids were dissolved in chloroform/methanol, 1:1 (v/v), and were dried under nitrogen. Appropriate volumes of DMEM were added to obtain micelles containing 1.4 mm sodium cholate, 1.5 mm sodium deoxycholate, 1.7 mm phosphatidylcholine, 2.2 mm oleic acid, and 1.9 mm monopalmitoylglycerol (10× micelle stock) and mixed. The suspension was sonicated using probe sonicator (550 Sonic Dismembrator, continuous pulse, output setting of 3, 3 min). These micelles (1/10th volume) were then added to enterocyte suspension to obtain physiologic concentrations of micelles (16Redinger R.N. Small D.M. Arch. Intern. Med. 1972; 130: 618-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Studies with Cells—Caco-2 (human colon carcinoma) cells obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) were cultured (75-cm2 flasks, Corning Glassworks, Corning, NY) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing high glucose supplemented with l-glutamine and antibiotic/antimycotic mixture (DMEM) and 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS). For experiments, cells from 70 to 80% confluent flasks were seeded on polycarbonate micropore membrane inserts (Transwells®, 6-well plate, 24 mm diameter, 3 μm pore size, Corning Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) at a density of 1 × 105 cells/cm2. To induce differentiation of these cells, media were changed every other day for 21 days (17Luchoomun J. Hussain M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19565-19572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 18Nayak N. Harrison E.H. Hussain M.M. J.

Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1086-1095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Experiments were conducted using two different pulse and pulse-chase labeling protocols. For the pulse-labeling experiments, cells received 2 ml of DMEM containing 20% FBS, 5 μCi/well [3H]cholesterol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), OA:TC (1.6:0.5 mm) on the apical side and 2 ml of medium with or without 1% BSA on the basolateral side for 17 h. For pulse-chase studies, cells were labeled with cholesterol for 17 h as described above with two exceptions; the OA:TC was omitted from the apical media, and the basolateral side received DMEM + 20% FBS. After pulse labeling, cells were thoroughly washed and incubated with DMEM containing 20% FBS and OA:TC (1.6:0.5 mm) on the apical side and DMEM ± 1% BSA on the basolateral side. Basolateral conditioned media (1.6 ml) were subjected to sequential density gradient ultracentrifugation (see below), and the rest was used for the measurement of apolipoproteins and radiolabeled cholesterol. Density Gradient Ultracentrifugation—Variable amounts of the conditioned media were brought to 4 ml with 1.006 g/ml density solution in SW41 ultracentrifuge tubes (17Luchoomun J. Hussain M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19565-19572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). To adjust the density to 1.12 g/ml, 0.565 g of KBr were added and dissolved by repeated pipetting. Media were sequentially overlaid with 3 ml each of 1.063 and 1.019 g/ml, and 2 ml of 1.006 g/ml density solutions. The tubes were subjected to ultracentrifugation (SW41 rotor, 40,000 rpm, 33 min, 15 °C), and the top 1 ml was aspirated. This was called fraction 1 and represents large chylomicrons (Sf >400) (17Luchoomun J. Hussain M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19565-19572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The gradients were then overlaid with 1 ml of 1.006 g/ml solution and centrifuged (40,000 rpm, 3 h and 30 min, 15 °C), and the top 1 ml was collected (fraction 2, small chylomicrons). The tubes were replenished with 1.006 g/ml solutions and centrifuged (40,000 rpm, 15 °C, 17 h), and the top 1 ml was collected by aspiration. This fraction 3 represents the VLDL size particles. The rest of the contents were fractionated into 1.5-ml fractions numbered 4–10. ApoB and radioactivity were measured in each fraction in triplicate. Secretion of Cholesterol with ApoB Lipoproteins—In most of the experiments, pulse-chase protocol was used to study the secretion of cholesterol with apoB lipoproteins. After 17 h of pulse labeling with [3H]cholesterol, differentiated Caco-2 cells were extensively washed with DMEM. Cells were then incubated for another 24 h in the presence of OA:TC to induce secretion of cholesterol with chylomicrons. To inhibit the secretion of cholesterol with lipoproteins, we used MTP inhibitor (BMS200150, 10 μm) along with OA:TC. Basolateral conditioned media were subjected to density gradient ultracentrifugation. Secretion of ApoB-free Cholesterol—Inhibition of apoB-free cholesterol secretion was studied by the addition of 1 mm glyburide (20Wang N. Silver D.L. Thiele C. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23742-23747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 21Murthy S. Born E. Mathur S.N. Field F.J. J.

Higher concentrations of glyburide were not used because of its insolubility in media. To induce ABCA1 expression (21Murthy S. Born E. Mathur S.N. Field F.J. J.

Commun. 2002; 296: 625-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), Caco-2 cells were treated with DMEM + 20% FBS + 1 μm 9-cis-retinoic acid (RA) + 25 μm 22-hydroxycholesterol (22(OH)C) along with [3H]cholesterol for 17 h. The basolateral side received DMEM + 20% FBS. Cells were washed and then received serum-free DMEM + RA + 22(OH)C on the apical side and serum-free DMEM on the basolateral side. After 8 h, cells were washed and supplemented with DMEM + 1% BSA + RA + 22(OH)C on the apical side and with DMEM + 1% BSA ± 1 mm glyburide on the basolateral side. Basolateral media were collected after 17 h and used for radioactive measurements and density gradient ultracentrifugation. After rinsing cells with PBS, lipids were extracted with isopropyl alcohol. Extraction and Analysis of Free and Esterified Cholesterol—Lipids were extracted from the media and fractions according to the method of Bligh and Dyer (23Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43084) Google Scholar). To 1 ml of media or fractions was added 3.75 ml of chloroform:methanol (1:2, v/v), mixed, and incubated at room temperature with intermittent mixing. After 15 min, 1.25 ml of chloroform was added, mixed, and incubated for 1 min. Subsequently, 1.25 ml of water was added; contents thoroughly mixed and centrifuged (10 min, 5,000 rpm), and the lower phase was collected with a Pasteur pipette. The leftover upper phase was extracted again with 1.25 ml of chloroform and combined with the earlier extract. Organic extracts from cells, media, and fractions were dried under nitrogen, dissolved in 100 μl of chloroform, and separated by thin layer chromatography on PE SIL G Silica gels (Whatman) using hexane:diethyl ether:glacial acetic acid (82:17:2, v/v/v). Bands corresponding to free cholesterol and cholesteryl esters were visualized after iodine exposure, scraped, and counted by liquid scintillation counting. Studies with Rat Primary Enterocytes—Rat enterocytes were isolated using EDTA treatment by the method of Weiser (24Weiser M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2536-2541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as elaborated by Pinkus (25Pinkus L.M. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 77: 154-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and Cartwright and Higgins (26Cartwright I.J. Higgins J.A. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1357-1365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, proximal 1/3rd to ½ portions of the intestines were collected from anesthetized rats, and the luminal contents were emptied and washed with 115 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.96 mm NaH2PO4, 26.19 mm NaHCO3, 5.5 mm glucose buffer, pH 7.4, gassed for 20 min with 95% O2, 5% CO2. One end of the intestines was then tied and filled with 67.5 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm KCl, 0.96 mm NaH2PO4, 26.19 mm NaHCO3, 27 mm sodium citrate, 5.5 mm glucose buffer, pH 7.4, saturated with 95% O2,5%CO2. The intestines were then incubated in a bath containing oxygenated 0.9% saline at 37 °C with constant shaking. After 10–15 min, the luminal solution was discarded and filled with 115 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.96 mm NaH2PO4, 26.19 mm NaHCO3, 1.5 mm EDTA, 5.5 mm glucose, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol buffer, pH 7.4, bubbled with 95% O2, 5% CO2 and bathed in saline as described above. After 15 min the luminal contents were collected and centrifuged (1,500 rpm, 5 min, room temperature), and pellets were resuspended in DMEM saturated with 95% O2, 5% CO2. Isolated enterocytes were incubated with 1 μCi of [3H]cholesterol at 37 °C with constant shaking, and cell suspensions were gassed with 95% O2, 5% CO2 at 15-min intervals. After 1 h, enterocytes were centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 5 min, and the cell pellets were washed with media. After washing, cells were chased for 2 h with DMEM containing 0.14 sodium cholate, 0.15 mm sodium deoxycholate, 0.17 mm phosphatidylcholine, 0.22 mm oleic acid, and 0.19 mm monopalmitoylglycerol micelles in the presence and absence of 10 μm BMS200150. At the end of the incubation, enterocytes were centrifuged (3,000 rpm, 5 min), and supernatants were used for density gradient ultracentrifugation. Other Methods—Protein was measured by the method of Bradford (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217370) Google Scholar). ApoB and apoA-I were quantified in the conditioned media and in different density gradient fractions using a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described previously (14Hussain M.M. Zhao Y. Kancha R.K. Blackhart B.D. Yao Z. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 485-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 15Bakillah A. Zhou Z. Luchoomun J. Hussain M.M. Lipids. 1997; 32: 1113-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Effect of Oleic Acid Supplementation on the Cellular Accumulation and Secretion of Cholesterol—It is generally believed that dietary cholesterol enters the body as part of chylomicrons synthesized by the intestinal cells. We have shown that supplementation of high concentrations of oleic acid (OA) induces chylomicron assembly and secretion by differentiated Caco-2 cells (17Luchoomun J. Hussain M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19565-19572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 18Nayak N. Harrison E.H. Hussain M.M. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 272-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19During A. Hussain M.M. Morel D.W. Harrison E.H. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1086-1095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). To study the effect of OA on the rate of cellular accumulation of cholesterol, differentiated Caco-2 cells were supplemented with [3H]cholesterol in the presence of either taurocholate (TC) or OA:TC on the apical side (Fig. 1A). There were no significant differences in the cellular accumulation of cholesterol under both experimental conditions. We then studied the secretion of radiolabeled cholesterol by these cells (Fig. 1B). Because OA increases secretion of larger apoB-containing lipoproteins by differentiated Caco-2 cells, we were expecting that OA treatment would increase cholesterol secretion. Unexpectedly, OA:TC neither changed the rates nor the amounts of cholesterol secreted compared with TC-treated cells (Fig. 1B). These studies indicate that OA supplementation does not affect cellular uptake and secretion of cholesterol. Consideration was given to the possibility that OA might have increased the secretion of lipoprotein-associated cholesterol. To test this hypothesis, cholesterol secretion by Caco-2 cells was studied under pulse labeling and pulse-chase labeling protocols described under “Experimental Procedures.” Secretion of cholesterol with chylomicrons was evaluated by density gradient ultracentrifugation and compared with the flotation properties of cholesterol in non-conditioned media (Fig. 2). Cholesterol was present at a d > 1.12 g/ml when centrifuged in non-conditioned media containing 1% BSA (Fig. 2A). During continuous pulse, the majority of the cholesterol was in the same fractions as in the non-conditioned media (compare Fig. 2, A with B). A small amount of cholesterol (≈2% of total secreted) was present in fractions 1–3 that correspond to d < 1.006 g/ml. In contrast to pulse labeling, during the chase of the pulse-chase protocol significantly higher amounts of cholesterol (40% of total secreted) were in larger lipoproteins (Fig. 2C, fractions 1–3). These studies indicated that during continuous pulse, the majority of the secreted cholesterol was in the bottom fractions, whereas during pulse-chase protocol significant amounts of cholesterol were in the top fractions that contained larger lipoproteins. In control experiments performed with [3H]mannitol, we determined that the increased amounts of cholesterol in the bottom fractions were not due to paracellular leakage (data not shown). To determine whether the large amounts of cholesterol present unassociated with lipoproteins was due to the presence of BSA in the conditioned media, we repeated these experiments in the presence of serum-free media (SFM) on the basolateral side. Cholesterol was mainly present at a density of 1.02 to 1.06 g/ml when centrifuged in SFM (Fig. 2D, fractions 5–7). During continuous pulse the majority of the secreted cholesterol was in the same fractions (1.02 < d > 1.06 g/ml) as it was in the non-conditioned media (compare Fig. 2, D with E). In addition, two more peaks (fractions 1–3 and 9 and 10) corresponding to d < 1.006 g/ml and d > 1.12 g/ml were evident (Fig. 2E). During pulse-chase (Fig. 2F), cholesterol was in two peaks (fractions 1–3 and 9 and 10) corresponding to d < 1.006 g/ml and d > 1.12 g/ml. Now ≈51% of total secreted cholesterol was with larger lipoproteins. These studies extended earlier observations that during pulse labeling the majority of the secreted cholesterol was not associated with larger lipoproteins, but it was associated with these lipoproteins during the chase. To determine whether cholesterol secretion in d > 1.12 g/ml fraction was unique to differentiated Caco-2 cells, we extended these studies to rat primary enterocytes (Fig. 3). First, we determined the flotation properties of cholesterol given to cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, free cholesterol was mainly present in fractions 4–6. Next, rat primary enterocytes were incubated with cholesterol for 1 h, washed, and then incubated with OA to induce chylomicron assembly and secretion. After 2 h, the conditioned media were subjected to density gradient ultracentrifugation (Fig. 3B). The secreted cholesterol was distributed in fractions 1–4 and 9 and 10. About 51% of the total secreted cholesterol was present in the top four fractions, and the bottom fractions contained 30% of secreted cholesterol. These studies suggest that intestinal cells secrete cholesterol in two forms that can be separated based on their flotation properties. Modulation of Lipoprotein-associated Cholesterol Secretion— Studies described in Figs. 2 and 3 indicated that during pulse-chase experiments higher amounts of cholesterol were secreted with lipoproteins. To determine whether OA-induced chylomicron assembly is required for cholesterol secretion during pulse-chase protocol, differentiated Caco-2 cells were pulse-labeled with [3H]cholesterol for 17 h and then chased with TC, OA:TC, or OA:TC + BMS200150 for 24 h. ApoB, apoAI, and cholesterol levels were measured in the basolateral media. OA:TC treatment specifically increased apoB secretion by 64% without affecting apoAI secretion compared with TC treatment (Table I). BMS200150 decreased the secretion of total apoB by 61% but had no effect on apoAI secretion (Table I). Analysis of cholesterol revealed that OA:TC treatment increased the secretion of cholesterol during chase by 41%. BMS200150 obliterated the OA-induced cholesterol secretion. These studies indicate that OA treatment increases apoB and cholesterol secretion during chase but has no effect on apoAI secretion. The increases in apoB and cholesterol secretion are abolished by the inhibition of MTP.Table IEffect of oleic acid and BSM200150 on the secretion of total apoB, apoA1, and cholesterol by differentiated Caco-2 cellsTCOA:TCOA:TC + BMS200150ApoB (ng·well-1)421.1 ± 20.7691.3 ± 57.2ap < 0.03 when compared with TC.271.9 ± 8.9bp < 0.01 when compared with OA:TC and p < 0.02 when compared with control.ApoA1 (μg·well-1)11.3 ± 0.710.3 ± 0.911.9 ± 0.6Cholesterol (dpm·10-3·well-1)58 ± 0.582.2 ± 1.9cp < 0.04 compared with TC.54.9 ± 2.6dp < 0.01 compared with OA:TC.a p < 0.03 when compared with TC.b p < 0.01 when compared with OA:TC and p < 0.02 when compared with control.c p < 0.04 compared with TC.d p < 0.01 compared with OA:TC. Open table in a new tab Density gradient ultracentrifugation analysis (Fig. 4A) showed that TC-treated cells did not secrete apoB as chylomicrons (Fig. 4A, fractions 1 and 2). Instead the majority of apoB was in smaller VLDL/intermediate density lipoprotein/low density lipoprotein-size lipoproteins (fractions 3–6) as has been described previously (18Nayak N. Harrison E.H. Hussain M.M. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 272-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). OA treatment increased (≈9-fold) the secretion of apoB as part of large and small chylomicrons and VLDL (Fig. 4A, fractions 1–3), consistent with our earlier studies (17Luchoomun J. Hussain M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19565-19572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 18Nayak N. Harrison E.H. Hussain M.M. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 272-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Now, fractions 1–3 contained 70% of secreted apoB. In the presence of the MTP inhibitor, secretion of apoB with large and small chylomicrons was completely inhibited. Instead, apoB was mainly present in smaller lipoproteins (Fig. 4A, fractions 3–6). Next, we looked at the distribution of secreted cholesterol in different lipoprotein fractions (Fig. 4B). There was no cholesterol in larger lipoprotein fractions in the conditioned media of TC-treated cells (Fig. 4B, fractions 1 and 2). Note that these cells secrete apoB as small lipoproteins (fractions 3–6), and these fractions also did not contain any appreciable amounts of cholesterol. The majority of the secreted cholesterol was in the bottom fraction that had no apoB (Fig. 4B, fraction 10). OA treatment drastically increased the secretion of cholesterol in larger apoB lipoproteins (Fig. 4B, fractions 1 and 2), but this treatment had no effect on the amounts of cholesterol secreted unassociated with lipoproteins (Fig. 4B, fractions 9 and 10). In BMS200150-treated cells, concomitant with decreased apoB secretion in larger lipoproteins, there was a significant decrease in the secretion of cholesterol in lipoprotein fractions (Fig. 4B, fractions 1 and 2). Note that BMS200150 had no effect on the secretion of apoB-free cholesterol (Fig. 4B, fraction 10). These studies showed that when apoB was secreted as part of smaller lipoproteins, cholesterol was not associated with these particles. Thus, it appears that OA-induced assembly of larger lipoproteins is essential for the secretion of cholesterol wit"
https://openalex.org/W2023553772,"The tumour suppressor activity of p53 in vivo can be subject to pressure from the physiological stress of hypoxia and we report on the development of a cell system to define the p53-dependent stages in the adaptation of cells to hypoxia. p53(+/+) cells exposed to hypoxia exhibited a transient arrest in G2/M, but escaped from this checkpoint and entered a long-term G(0)/G(1) arrest. By contrast, isogenic p53-null cells exposed to hypoxic conditions exhibited a 6-10-fold higher level of apoptosis, suggesting that p53 acts as a survival factor under limiting oxygen concentrations. Surprisingly, hypoxia-dependent growth arrest in p53(+/+) cells did not result in either p21(WAF1) or HIF-1 protein stabilization, but rather promoted a significant decrease in Ser(392)-site phosphorylation at the CK2/FACT site. However, chemically induced anoxia induced Ser(392)-site phosphorylation as well as stabilization of both p53 and HIF-1 proteins. In contrast to hypoxia, 5-flourouracil (5-FU)-induced p53-dependent cell death correlated with enhanced Ser(392) phosphorylation of p53 and elevated p21(WAF1) protein levels. Hypoxia inhibited 5-FU-induced p53-dependent cell death and attenuated p53 phosphorylation at the ATM and CK2/FACT phosphorylation sites. Although anoxia activates the p53 response, hypoxia silences the p53 transactivation pathway and identifies a physiological signalling model to study mechanisms of p53 inactivation under hypoxic conditions."

Evidence suggests that the resulting MLL fusion genes contribute to leukemogenesis. AF9 is a common MLL fusion partner in acute myeloid leukemia. The AF9 protein functions as a transcriptional activator in artificial reporter gene assays and a structurally related protein in yeast, ANC1/TFG3, is a component of the SWI/SNF complex. Apart from these observations, little is known about the biologic function of AF9 in mammals. We have found that a recently described transcriptional repressor, BCL-6 corepressor (BCoR), interacts with the carboxy-terminus of AF9. The interaction of AF9 with BCoR has been confirmed by independent in vitro and in vivo protein-binding studies. The BCoR gene is expressed as several alternatively spliced transcripts. AF9 only binds BCoR isoforms that contain a unique 34 aa sequence located in the mid-portion of the protein. In artificial reporter gene assays, a BCoR isoform that binds AF9 efficiently suppresses AF9 transcriptional activity, while a nonbinding isoform does not. These results indicate that different isoforms of BCoR have unique biologic properties and that cell function may be partly determined by the different isoforms that are present within the cell."

https://openalex.org/W2141930618,"We cloned a novel cDNA derived from the CARD6 gene locus on chromosome 5p12 of 311 amino acids in length. By immunoprecipitation we detected specific binding of this CARD6-encoding protein to Nod1 (CARD4), Cardiak (Rip2/Rick), NAC (NALP1/DEFCAP/CARD7), and TUCAN (CARD8/Cardinal/NDPP/Dakar), caspase recruitment domain (CARD)-containing proteins implicated in NF-κB and caspase-1 activation but not to other CARD family proteins. Cardiak and Nod1 (but not other CARD proteins) also exhibited opposing effects on CARD6 protein phosphorylation and expression, providing further evidence of functional interactions among these proteins in cells. In transfection experiments, the CARD6 protein suppressed NF-κB induction by Nod1 or Cardiak but did not interfere with NF-κB activation by the CARD-containing adapter protein Bcl10 or the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α, demonstrating specificity of CARD6 for Nod-1 and Cardiak-dependent pathways. In contrast to its effects on Nod1- and Cardiak-dependent NF-κB activation, CARD6 did not interfere with caspase-1-dependent interleukin-1β secretion induced by Cardiak or Nod1. CARD6 also did not affect caspase activation and apoptosis induced by overexpression of Fas, Bax, or other pro-apoptotic stimuli. Thus, CARD6 represents a selective modulator of NF-κB activation by Cardiak and Nod1, adding to the repertoire of CARD-family proteins implicated in inflammatory responses and innate immunity. We cloned a novel cDNA derived from the CARD6 gene locus on chromosome 5p12 of 311 amino acids in length. By immunoprecipitation we detected specific binding of this CARD6-encoding protein to Nod1 (CARD4), Cardiak (Rip2/Rick), NAC (NALP1/DEFCAP/CARD7), and TUCAN (CARD8/Cardinal/NDPP/Dakar), caspase recruitment domain (CARD)-containing proteins implicated in NF-κB and caspase-1 activation but not to other CARD family proteins.

Thus, CARD6 represents a selective modulator of NF-κB activation by Cardiak and Nod1, adding to the repertoire of CARD-family proteins implicated in inflammatory responses and innate immunity. Proteins containing the caspase recruitment domain (CARD) 1The abbreviations used are: CARD, caspase recruitment domain; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; IKK, IκB kinase complex; TNF, Tumor Necrosis Factor; IL, Interleukin; LRR, leucine-rich repeat; wt, wild type. are critically involved in assembly of signal complexes leading to activation of caspase family proteases as well as induction of NF-κB family transcription factors. The CARD represents a protein interaction motif consisting of a bundle of usually six antiparallel α-helices. This protein fold defines a branch of a larger group of closely related domains, comprising four families that include the CARDs, “death domains,” “death effector domains,” and the “Pyrin, AIM, ASC, and death domain-like” (PAAD) (also known as PYRIN, PYD, or DAPIN) domains (1Pawlowski K.

Homotypic interactions among CARD-containing adapter proteins occur with the inactive zymogen forms of caspases that possess N-terminal pro-domains containing complementary CARDs, resulting in formation of multiprotein complexes and leading to protease cleavage and activation by an induced proximity mechanism (6Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10964-10967Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). Caspases represent a family of intracellular cysteine proteases that play important roles in apoptosis and cytokine processing by virtue of their ability to cleave protein substrates involved in cell death or inflammation. Various CARD-containing proteins have also been identified that compete for binding to these pro-caspases or adapter proteins, thereby suppressing caspase activation (for review, see Ref. 7Reed J.C. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 1415-1430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Besides caspase activation, several CARD-containing proteins have been implicated in NF-κB activation, including the Nod1 (CARD4) and Nod2 (CARD15) proteins, Cardiak (Rick/Rip2), Bcl10 (Clap/Ciper/Carmen/mE10/cE10), CARD9, the cIAP1 and cIAP2 proteins, and the MAGUK family of CARD proteins (CARD10, CARD11, and CARD14). These NF-κB-inducing CARD family proteins function in signaling pathways of the adaptive or innate immune system, thus leading to the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB and promoting inflammatory responses (for review, see Ref. 5Bouchier-Hayes L. Martin S.J. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 616-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). NF-κB represents a family of dimeric transcription factors containing the Rel homology domain, which play critical roles in regulating expression of genes involved in inflammation, immunity, and apoptosis (for review, see Ref. 8Karin M. Delhase M. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). NF-κBs are sequestered in the cytoplasm by inhibitory proteins called IκBs. In the classical pathway for NF-κB induction, IκB molecules are removed by proteasome-dependent degradation after phosphorylation by the IκB kinase complex (IKK) complex, thus releasing NF-κB family proteins to enter the nucleus. The IKK complex consists of two related kinases, IKKα/IKK1 and IKKβ/IKK2, and a scaffold subunit IKKγ/Nemo (for review, see Ref. 9Silverman N. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2321-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). Nod1/CARD4, a widely expressed protein, and Nod2 (CARD15), a monocyte-specific protein, have a domain organization reminiscent of the pro-caspase-9-activating protein Apaf1, the pro-caspase-1-activating protein CLAN (Ipaf/CARD12), plant disease resistance “R” proteins, and a large family of PAAD/Pyrin domain-containing proteins, which have been implicated in NF-κB and caspase-1 regulation (10Stehlik C.

This family of related proteins is characterized by the presence the NACHT module, a nucleotide binding oligomerization domain (19Koonin E.V. Aravind L. Trends Biol. Sci. 2000; 25: 223-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), typically followed by a series of leucine-rich repeats (LRRs). The LRRs of these intracellular proteins are analogous to the LRRs found in the extracellular domains of Toll family receptors expressed on the cell surface, which recognize extracellular pathogen-derived molecules such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), bacterial peptidoglycans, CpG DNA, and other structures that create so-called “pathogen-associated molecular patterns” (PAMPs) (20Medzhitov R. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 1: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (3280) Google Scholar). In this regard Nod1 has been reported to function as an intracellular receptor for LPS, whereby LPS binding to the LRRs of Nod1 is envisioned as a signal for inducing oligomerization of the NACHT domains of this protein, triggering NF-κB activation by the induced proximity mechanism by virtue of the ability of the CARD of Nod1 to interact with the corresponding CARD of the IKK-binding protein Cardiak/Rick/Rip2 (21Inohara N.

Nod1 was also recently reported to induce caspase-1 activation in conjunction with Cardiak (26Yoo N.J. Park W.S. Kim S.Y. Reed J.C. Son S.G. Lee J.Y. Lee S.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 299: 652-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), probably reflecting the ability of the CARD of Cardiak to bind the corresponding CARD within the pro-domain of pro-caspase-1. Caspase-1 is responsible for proteolytic processing of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including pro-interleukin (IL)-1β and pro-IL-18 (27Dinarello C.A. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). In addition to its CARD domain, Cardiak contains a serine/threonine kinase domain of uncertain function (28McCarthy J. Ni J. Dixit V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16968-16975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 29Thome M. Hofmann K. Burns K. Martinon F. Bodmer J. Mattman C. Tschopp J. Curr.

Interestingly, Cardiak is recruited to certain Toll-like receptor-signaling complexes after stimulation with their cognate ligands (e.g. LPS, peptidoglycan, and double-stranded RNA). Recently, Cardiak (–/–) mice were also shown to exhibit defects in Toll-like receptor, IL-1, IL-18, and Nod signaling. Moreover, T-cells from Cardiak (–/–) mice displayed defects in NF-κB activation, IL-2 production, proliferation, and differentiation to TH1 cells, suggesting Cardiak functions as a signaling component of relevance to both adaptive and innate immune responses (31Chin A.I. Dempsey P.W. Bruhn K. Miller J.F. Xu Y. Cheng G. Nature. 2002; 416: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 32Kobayashi K. Inohara N. Hernandez L.D. Galan J.E. Nunez G. Janeway C.A.

Here we report cloning and characterization of a cDNA encoding a CARD-containing 311-amino acid protein encoded in the CARD6 gene locus. This CARD6-encoded protein interacts with Cardiak and Nod1 and specifically impairs their ability to induce the transcription factor NF-κB. The CARD6 protein, thus, might regulate the duration of the signaling initiated by these pro-inflammatory proteins or help to set thresholds for their activation so that unintended inflammation is avoided. Bioinformatics—Starting from the sequence of the CARD domain of Apaf1 (33Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2746) Google Scholar), a cascade of PSI-BLAST (34Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaeffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60199) Google Scholar) searches was performed using new “hits” as queries for subsequent searches until no new hits were found, as described elsewhere (35Li W.Z. Pio F. Pawlowski K. Godzik A. Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 1105-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Lower significance hits from this procedure (“saturated BLAST”) were confirmed (or rejected) using the profile-to-profile alignment algorithm FFAS (36Rychlewski L. Jaroszewski L. Li W. Godzik A. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 232-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) against a library of apoptosis-related domains. The detailed analysis of three-dimensional models of the putative CARD domains was a final criterion in accepting/rejecting distant members of the family. After the complete list of proteins in the CARD family was assembled, representative members of the family were used to scan genomic and EST databases with the TBLASTN program. Genomic regions where similarity to the CARD domain was found were again verified against the FFAS server and later analyzed with gene-finding programs (37Burge C. Karlin S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 78-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (3095) Google Scholar) for the presence of other domains until a complete protein sequence was assembled. Three-dimensional models of CARD domains were generated using the MODELLER program (38Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10625) Google Scholar), based on FFAS alignments. Among the predicted CARD family genes thus identified was a locus previously given the name “CARD6” (GenBank™ accession number NM_032587). cDNA Cloning and Plasmid Construction—High fidelity PCR (Stratagene) was used to clone cDNAs encoded by the CARD6 gene from a skeletal muscle cDNA library (Clontech), obtaining a single PCR product of 1107 bp, which was cloned into pcDNA3 plasmids (Invitrogen) and determined by DNA sequencing to contain the complete open reading frame for a 311-amino acid protein followed by a stop codon, a polyadenylation signal, and a poly(A) sequence. Deletion mutants were generated by high fidelity PCR. The Cardiak (K47M) mutant was generated using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Expression plasmids for Apaf1, ASC, Bcl10, Cardiak, Clan, pro-caspase-1, pro-caspase-9, Nac, Nod2, and TUCAN have been described previously (10Stehlik C. Fiorentino L. Dorfleutner A. Ariza E.M.

CARD10, cIAP1, cIAP2, and Nod2 were amplified by reverse transcription-PCR from cDNAs (Clontech, Origene) and cloned into pcDNA3 plasmids (Invitrogen). Pro-caspase-4, pro-caspase-5, Nod1, and RAIDD expression plasmids were kindly provided by Yoshihide Tsuimoto, Alan G. Porter, Gabriel Nunez, and Emad S. Alnemri, respectively. Authenticity of all constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293T and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Where indicated, cells were treated with 10 ng/ml TNFα for 8 h. Transfection of HEK293 cells was accomplished using Superfect (Qiagen), whereas HeLa cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen), holding total DNA content constant. Co-immunoprecipitation Assays—Cells (5 × 105–1 × 106) were lysed in isotonic lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 12.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm NaF, 200 μm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× protease inhibitor mix (Roche Applied Science)). Clarified lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using agarose-conjugated anti-c-Myc, anti-hemagglutinin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma) antibodies. After incubation at 4 °C for 4–12 h, immune complexes were washed 3 times in lysis buffer, separated by SDS/PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-c-Myc, anti-hemagglutinin, anti-FLAG, or anti-caspase-4 antibodies as indicated in conjunction with ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Where indicated, cell lysates (10% volume) were run alongside immune complexes. Alternatively, lysates were directly analyzed by immunoblotting after normalization for total protein content. In Vitro Kinase Assays—HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with plasmids expressing FLAG-Cardiak. After 2 days, cell lysates were prepared, and FLAG-Cardiak protein was immunoprecipitated with agarose-conjugated anti-FLAG M2 antibody. Kinase reactions were initiated by resuspending washed immune complexes in 1 μm of [γ-32P]ATP in 10 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, and 1 mm EDTA) containing CARD6 protein as an exogenous substrate, where Myc-tagged CARD6 protein was generated by transient transfection in HEK293T cells and recovered by immunoprecipitation. After 20 min at 37 °C, reactions were stopped by the addition of an equal volume of SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Phosphatase Treatment—HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding Myc-CARD6 with or without plasmids encoding FLAG-Cardiak. Cleared lysates were diluted 1:20 with 20 μlof reaction buffer (25 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2) and treated with 2 units of calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by adding SDS sample buffer and following with SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting. NF-κB Reporter Gene Assay—Typically, 105 HEK293 cells, cultured in 24-well plates in 5% serum, were transiently transfected with a total of 1 μg of plasmid DNA (normalized for total DNA) including 144 ng of pNF-κB-LUC (Clontech) and 6 ng of a Renilla luciferase gene driven by a constitutive thymidine kinase (TK) promoter (pRL-TK; Promega). Lysates were analyzed using the dual luciferase kit (Promega). Where indicated, cells were treated with 10 ng/ml TNFα for 8 h before analysis. IL-1β Secretion Assay—IL-1β secreted into culture supernatants of HEK293N cells transiently transfected in 24-well plates was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a commercial kit (R&D Systems); data were normalized for cell numbers, and assays were performed triplicate (42Lee S.-H. Stehlik C. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34495-34500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Caspase Activity Assay—HEK293N cells were transiently transfected in 6-well dishes, and at 24 h post-transfection, cells were suspended in caspase lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 25 NaCl, 0.25% Triton X-100, and 1 mm EDTA) and normalized for protein content. Typically, 15–25 μg of lysates were analyzed for protease activity by continuously measuring the release of fluorigenic Ac-DEVD-AFC (Bachem) at 37 °C, as described (43Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence Analysis—HeLa cells were transfected with plasmids encoding green fluorescent protein green fluorescent protein-CARD6 fusion proteins, transferred to 4-well polylysine-coated chamber slides (LabTec) the following day, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde 1 day later, permeabilized with Triton X-100, stained with Topro-3 (Molecular Probes) for detection of nuclei, and analyzed by confocal laser-scanning microscopy (Bio-Rad). Cloning of cDNAs Encoding a CARD-containing Protein Encoded in the CARD6 Gene Locus—Using bioinformatics approaches, we mined the human genome for novel CARD-encoding genes. These efforts resulted in the identification of a candidate gene predicted to encode a protein consisting of a CARD domain as the only recognized domain (Fig. 1A). Subsequently, this locus was given the name CARD6 (GenBank™ accession number NM_032587 by J. Bertin and colleagues), which will be applied here. Using reverse transcription-PCR methods, we cloned cDNAs derived from the CARD6 locus and determined their DNA sequences. A single cDNA was obtained containing an open reading frame of 933 bp in length encoding a protein of 311 amino acid residues (Fig. 1B). Significant homology between residues 1 and 91 is found to other CARD family members (Fig. 1C). The region downstream of the CARD in this CARD6-encoded protein (residues 92 to the C terminus) lacks significant homology to other proteins but contains several potential phosphorylation sites, as predicted by NetPhos 2.0 (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetPhos). Recently, the predicted cDNA sequence of a longer, 1037-amino acid protein with an identical CARD domain was deposited in GenBank™ (GenBank™ accession number NM_032587) under the name CARD6); however, we did not obtain such cDNAs by our cloning method. Besides being shorter, the last 30 amino acids are different in our predicted protein compared with accession number NM_032587. The nucleotide sequence of human cDNA we identified displays significant homology to an automatic prediction of an open reading frame in the mouse by GenBank™ (Fig. 1D). The predicted human and mouse CARD6 proteins share 53.2% amino acid sequence identity (63.4% similarity), although the human CARD6-encoded protein we identified is 26 amino acid residues longer. In addition, the structures of the human CARD6 and mouse CARD6 genes differ in their 3′-ends, with cDNAs derived from the human gene demonstrating sequence identity to regions encompassed in three exons, compared with two exons in the mouse gene (Fig. 1E). The human gene therefore spans at least 18.9 kilobases on chromosome 5p12 (based on genomic clone NT_034769), whereas the mouse Card6 gene spans at least 3.5 kilobases on band a1 of mouse chromosome 15 (based on genomic clone NW_000102). Interestingly, the region of the mouse genome where Card6 resides is syntenic to the chromosome 5p12 region of humans. Tissue Expression of CARD6 mRNA and Subcellular Location of CARD6 Protein—To explore the tissue distribution of CARD6-encoded mRNAs, we hybridized a Northern blot containing poly-A-selected mRNA from multiple human tissues with a 32P-labeled CARD6-specific probe. Two transcripts were detected of ∼4.4 and 6.3 kilobases, which could represent differentially spliced transcripts or utilization of different polyadenylation sites (Fig. 2A). The smaller transcript is found in almost all tissues except for brain, whereas the larger transcript was present only in heart and skeletal muscle. To explore the intracellular location of the CARD6 protein, we transiently transfected HeLa cells with a plasmid encoding a green fluorescent protein-CARD6 fusion protein and analyzed the location of the resulting protein by confocal microscopy. Green fluorescent protein-CARD6 exhibited a diffuse cytoplasmic pattern and in occasional cells was also found in the nucleus, as confirmed by counterstaining of nuclear DNA with Topro-3 (Fig. 2B). CARD6 Interacts with Other CARD Proteins—The CARD is a homotypic interaction domain. Therefore, we tested the ability of the CARD6 protein to associate with several of the known CARD family proteins by co-immunoprecipitation assays after transient co-transfection in HEK293T cells. As demonstrated in Fig. 3, among the 18 CARD family members tested, only Nod1, Cardiak, TUCAN, and NAC preferentially interacted with CARD6 (Fig. 3A). However, we could not detect any association between CARD6 and the other CARD proteins, including CARD-carrying caspases (Fig. 3B). Also we failed to detect CARD6 self-association, although many CARD family members show this ability. Effects of Nod1 and Cardiak on CARD6 Protein Levels— During our studies, we observed that co-expression of Cardiak with CARD6 in HEK293T cells markedly increased CARD6 protein levels and also resulted in a shift in molecular weight of a portion of the CARD6 protein (Fig. 4A), suggestive of a post-translational modification. In contrast, Nod1 did not influence the levels of CARD6 protein (Fig. 4, A and B). However, co-expression of a Nod1 mutant lacking its CARD domain, Nod1 (ΔCARD), resulted in reduced expression of the CARD6 protein (Fig. 4B). When we expressed the three proteins of Nod1, Cardiak, and CARD6 together, we observed that Nod1 abolished the Cardiak-mediated effect on CARD6 protein expression and modification. In contrast, co-expression of just the CARD of Nod1 (Nod1-CARD) with Cardiak and CARD6 did not alter the Cardiak effect on the CARD6 protein (Fig. 4A). In contrast to CARD6, gene transfer-mediated overexpression of Nod1 and Cardiak had no effects on the expression of a variety of other control proteins in similar co-transfection assays (not shown), thus demonstrating the specificity of these results. Investigation of Cardiak Effects on CARD6 Phosphorylation—Because Cardiak possesses a kinase domain (28McCarthy J. Ni J. Dixit V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16968-16975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 29Thome M. Hofmann K. Burns K. Martinon F. Bodmer J. Mattman C. Tschopp J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 16: 885-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar), we investigated whether the modification of CARD6 observed upon co-expression of Cardiak might represent phosphorylation. Accordingly, we co-expressed CARD6 with or without Cardiak in HEK293T cells, prepared cell lysates, and then treated half of the lysates with alkaline phosphatase for comparison with untreated lysates. Indeed, treatment of lysates with phosphatase reversed the modification of the CARD6 protein, which was seen when Cardiak had been co-expressed. Thus, Cardiak appears to induce phosphorylation of the CARD6 protein (Fig. 5A). The effect of Cardiak on CARD6 protein levels made it difficult to determine whether Cardiak directly induces phosphorylation of CARD6 or merely allows sufficient CARD6 protein accumulation so that the modified form of CARD6 becomes detectable. We therefore performed experiments in which Cardiak was immunoprecipitated from transiently transfected HEK293T cells and used for in vitro kinase assays, employing CARD6 as a substrate (Fig. 5B). Autophosphorylation of Cardiak (P-Cardiak) was detected in these kinase assays but not phosphorylation of CARD6 (P-CARD6) (Fig. 5B), suggesting that Cardiak does not directly phosphorylate CARD6. Finally, to resolve the issue of the role of Cardiak in phosphorylation of CARD6, we compared the effects of co-expressing CARD6 with either wild type Cardiak or a kinase-dead mutant of Cardiak, where the lysine 47 was mutated to methionine. Co-expression of CARD6 with Cardiak (K47M) did not inhibit the phosphorylation of CARD6 compared with wild-type Cardiak. Both wild type and K47M Cardiak also resulted in increased levels of CARD6 protein, indicating that the kinase activity of Cardiak is not required for the Cardiak-mediated effect on CARD6 protein levels (Fig. 5C). CARD6 Selectively Suppresses NF-κB Activity Induced by Nod1 and Cardiak—Several Card family proteins have been reported to induce the transcription factor NF-κB, including Nod1 and Cardiak. To explore the effects of CARD6 on NF-κB, HEK293N cells were transiently transfected with control plasmid or an expression plasmid encoding epitope-tagged CARD6 protein and then analyzed for NF-κB reporter gene activity. As shown in Fig. 6, CARD6 does not activate NF-κB when expressed in cells by itself (Fig. 6C). Because it was shown that Nod1 and Cardiak strongly induce NF-κB activation, we investigated the effect of CARD6 on NF-κB activation in cells expressing Nod1, Cardiak, or various other NF-κB-activators, such as Bcl10, a CARD-containing adaptor protein that links signals from B-cell and T-cell antigen receptors to NF-κB activation (44Ruland J.

https://openalex.org/W1979192765,"In astrocytic neoplasms, the number of cells expressing glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is inversely proportional to the extent of anaplasia. The loss of GFAP expression, the principal marker of astroglial cells, in these tumors has been proposed to constitute a step in their development and progression. To test this hypothesis, we crossed p53-negative (p53−/−) mice, which frequently develop astrocytomas after intrauterine exposure to ethylnitrosourea, with GFAP-negative (GFAP−/−) mice or GFAP+/+ controls. Brain tumors of glial origin were found in 12 of 35 GFAP+/+ p53−/− mice (34%) and in 11 of 27 GFAP−/− p53−/− mice (41%). The two groups did not differ in the age at which tumors were detected or in tumor histology or progression. Thus, the loss of GFAP expression frequently seen in high-grade astrocytomas does not constitute a step in tumor development. Rather, it may represent the undifferentiated state of these cells."

Here, we demonstrate the expression and functional role of cGMP-dependent protein kinases (PKGs) in rat adrenal cortex. Expression of PKG II is restricted to adrenal zona glomerulosa (ZG) cells, whereas PKG I is localized to the adrenal capsule and blood vessels. Activation of the aldosterone system by a low sodium diet up-regulated the expression of PKG II, however, it did not change PKG I expression in adrenal cortex. Both, activation of PKG II in isolated ZG cell and adenoviral gene transfer of wild type PKG II into ZG cells enhanced aldosterone production. In contrast, inhibition of PKG II as well as infection with a PKG II catalytically inactive mutant had an inhibitory effect on aldosterone production. Steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein that regulates the rate-limiting step in steroidogenesis is a new substrate for PKG II and can be phosphorylated by PKG II in vitro at serine 55/56 and serine 99. Stimulation of aldosterone production by PKG II in contrast to stimulation by PKA did not activate StAR gene expression in ZG cells.

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system plays a pivotal role in the regulation of salt and water homeostasis by promoting the constriction of arterioles within the renal and systemic circulation and reabsorption of sodium in proximal segments of the nephron through angiotensin II (Ang II). 1The abbreviations used are: Ang II, angiotensin II; ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; PKG, cGMP-dependent protein kinase; ODQ, 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one; PDE, phosphodiesterase; sGC, soluble guanylyl cyclase; StAR, steroidogenic acute regulatory protein; VASP, vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein; ZG, zona glomerulosa; NP, natriuretic peptide; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; 8-pCPT-cGMP, 8-para-chlorophenylthio-cGMP; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MS, mass spectrometry; RIA, radioimmunoassay; WT, wild type.1The abbreviations used are: Ang II, angiotensin II; ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; PKG, cGMP-dependent protein kinase; ODQ, 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one; PDE, phosphodiesterase; sGC, soluble guanylyl cyclase; StAR, steroidogenic acute regulatory protein; VASP, vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein; ZG, zona glomerulosa; NP, natriuretic peptide; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; 8-pCPT-cGMP, 8-para-chlorophenylthio-cGMP; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MS, mass spectrometry; RIA, radioimmunoassay; WT, wild type. Ang II also stimulates aldosterone production from adrenal zona glomerulosa (ZG), which promotes the reabsorption of sodium, by activating sodium-potassium ATPases and epithelial sodium channels (reviewed in Ref. 1Weber K.T. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 345: 1689-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Regulation of aldosterone production is under the multifunctional control of different factors among which the most important are adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), Ang II, and K+. These factors utilize a variety of transduction mechanisms, including activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), protein kinase C (PKC), and regulation of cytosolic free calcium. Acute stimulation of steroid production requires both the synthesis of new proteins and protein phosphorylation. The delivery of the steroid substrate cholesterol from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane, a process mediated by the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), represents the rate-limiting step for the production of aldosterone and other steroids (reviewed in Ref. 2Stocco D.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 193-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). StAR is a phosphoprotein that has several putative phosphorylation sites for different protein kinases (cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases, PKC). However, until now only PKA-specific phosphorylation at serine 56 and serine 194 of StAR has been demonstrated and shown to increase the delivery of sterol substrate and, in part, to account for the immediate effects of cAMP on steroid production (3Arakane F. King S.R. Du Y. Kallen C.B. Walsh L.P. Watari H. Stocco D.M. Strauss III, J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32656-32662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Although multiple factors control aldosterone production, only natriuretic peptides (NPs) and nitric oxide (NO), which have effects partially mediated by the second messenger cGMP, are potent inhibitors of agonist-induced aldosterone synthesis in ZG cells (4Barrett P.Q.

Intracellular cGMP effects can be mediated by a number of effectors, including cGMP-gated channels, cGMP-dependent protein kinases, and cGMP-regulated phosphodiesterases (reviewed in Refs. 7Lohmann S.M.

Several reports indicate that cGMP-driven inhibition of ACTH-stimulated aldosterone synthesis is, at least in part, mediated by cGMP-stimulated phosphodiesterase (PDE 2) that is expressed at high levels in ZG cells (9MacFarland R.T.

Mammalian PKG exists as two major forms, PKG I, a soluble enzyme consisting of α and β isoforms derived from alternative splicing from one gene, and PKG II, a myristoylated, membrane-associated form derived from a second gene (7Lohmann S.M.

One of the major functions of PKG I is the regulation of intracellular Ca2+, which inhibits vascular smooth muscle contraction, platelet aggregation, and endothelial cell permeability (7Lohmann S.M.

Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1671-1676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to PKG I, PKG II often has a quite different localization and certain distinct and specific functions. Included in the few known PKG II functions are the phosphorylation and activation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in intestinal mucosa (13Vaandrager A.B. Smolenski A.

Expression of PKG II in adrenal cortex is restricted to ZG cells, whereas PKG I is localized in the adrenal capsule and blood vessels. We present strong evidence that PKG II serves as an important regulator of basal aldosterone production and that the stimulation of aldosterone production by PKG II correlates with the phosphorylation of StAR protein but not with an activation of StAR gene expression in ZG cells. Animal Experiments and Immunohistochemistry—Male Sprague-Dawley rats (200–300 g) were used in all experiments. Low sodium diet rats were kept for 5 days on a diet containing 0.02% NaCl (0.6% NaCl, is a standard diet). After 5 days rats were killed by decapitation, and adrenal glands were dissected to the adrenal capsule with zona glomerulosa (cortex) and remaining adrenal tissues (medulla) and used for Western blotting. For immunohistochemistry, rats were perfused through the abdominal aorta with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and sections of adrenal gland were prepared from three control and three low sodium diet rats. The sections were incubated with affinity-purified PKG II (1:100) or PKG I (1:200) (18Markert T. Vaandrager A.B. Gambaryan S. Pöhler D. Häusler C. Walter U. De Jonge H.R. Jarchau T. Lohmann S.M. J.

The specificity of immunofluorescent staining was verified by pre-absorption of affinity-purified antibodies with the respective recombinant PKG II or PKG I proteins (data not shown) as described previously (19de Vente J.

Animal experiments were performed in accordance with the German animal protection law. Western Blot Analysis—Adrenal cortex and medulla were homogenized in PBS containing protease inhibitors (Complete™, Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany). SDS gel loading buffer was added to the homogenate and directly to freshly isolated and cultured ZG or NCI cells.

For visualization of the signal, goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase was used as secondary antibodies, followed by ECL detection (Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany). Preparation of Zona Glomerulosa Cells—Cells were prepared from a dissected rat adrenal capsule with ZG by collagenase digestion and mechanical disaggregation as described previously (23Gallo-Payet N. Payet M.D. Chouinard L. Balestre M.N. Guillon G. Cell Signal. 1993; 5: 651-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For experiments in freshly isolated cells, the cells were suspended in DMEM (50–100 × 105 cells/sample) and preincubated for1hat37 °C in the cell culture incubator. After this resting period, cells were resuspended in 1 ml of fresh DMEM with different combinations of substances to be tested: ACTH 1–24 peptide (Organon, Toronto, Canada), ODQ (Calbiochem, Alexis, Laeufelfingen, Switzerland), forskolin (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany), 8-pCPT-cGMP, R p-8-pCPT-cGMPS (BioLog, Bremen, Germany). For primary culture, cells were plated into 6-well plates at a density of 7–10 × 104 cells/well. After 2 days cells were directly used for experiments of aldosterone production or were first infected with adenovirus containing cDNA of rat PKG II or adenovirus encoding a catalytically inactive form of rat PKG II (PKG II K482A). Experiments on NCI-h295R Cells—NCI adrenocortical cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured in DMEM/Ham's F-12 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 1% insulin-transferrin-sodium selenite premixed (ITS, Roche Applied Science) in 6-well plates. The cells were grown until confluence, washed with PBS, and fresh media with tested substances was added to cells for 6 h, then media was removed and used for aldosterone determination.

As a control, a vector encoding a catalytically inactive rat PKG II (PKG II-K482A) was used. The inactive mutant was generated using PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis to replace the essential Lys482 with Ala within the ATP binding site of PKG II, confirmed by sequencing, and inserted into an adenoviral vector using the method described previously (13Vaandrager A.B. Smolenski A. Tilly B.C. Houtsmuller A.B. Ehlert E.M. Bot A.G. Edixhoven M. Boomaars W.E. Lohmann S.M. de Jonge H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

ZG cells cultured for 2 days were infected with adenoviral vectors (1011 particles/ml) then incubated for a further 24 h for PKG II expression. Adenovirus were then removed, and 1 ml of DMEM with or without test substances was added to cells for 1 h, then medium was removed and used for aldosterone determination, and cells were harvested for Western blot analysis of PKG II expression and VASP phosphorylation. In Vitro Phosphorylation of StAR Protein—For overexpression and protein purification the full-length StAR protein cDNA was cloned by reverse transcription-PCR using published sequence information (24Clark B.J.

All constructs were confirmed by sequence analysis. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were transfected with pEBG-StAR, and GST-StAR protein was purified in a glutathione column and phosphorylated in vitro by PKG II and the catalytic subunit of PKA type II as described (26Butt E. Immler D. Meyer H.E. Kotlyarov A. Laaβ K. Gaestel M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7108-7113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and 32P incorporation was visualized by autoradiography. Mass Spectrometry Analysis—Full-length rat StAR cDNA was cloned into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of pGEX4T1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) to generate GST-StAR fusion protein. Expression and purification of the GST fusion protein was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Purity was analyzed by examination of Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE. Purified StAR protein was phosphorylated in vitro by PKG II and the catalytic subunit of PKA type II, and separated by SDS-PAGE. Gel pieces were washed sequentially for 10 min in tryptic digestion buffer (10 mm NH4HCO3) and digestion buffer:acetonitrile (1:1). These steps were repeated three times and led to a shrinking of the gel. It was reswollen with 2 μl of protease solution (trypsin at 0.05 μg/μl) in digestion buffer and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Analysis of the resulting peptides was carried out using a nano-HPLC system coupled directly to an electrospray ionization-ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with a custom-built nano-electrospray ion source (LCQ™ Classic, Thermo Finnigan, San Jose, CA). 15 μl of 5% (v/v) formic acid was added to the gel pieces, and the peptides were extracted by sonication for 15 min. The extraction step was repeated once. The supernatants were transferred to glass tubes, and the peptides were automatically flushed and preconcentrated on a μC18 precolumn (Nano-Precolumn™, 0.3-mm inner diameter × 1 mm, C18 PepMap™, LC Packings Dionex, Idstein, Germany) for 10 min with 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and a flow of 40 μl/min. Tryptic peptides were injected automatically on the reversed-phase C18 column (75-μm inner diameter × 250 mm, C18 PepMap™, 5-μm particle size, LC Packings Dionex) using the Switchos™ system (LC Packings Dionex). Separation of the peptides was carried out in a gradient consisting of 0.5% (v/v) formic acid (solvent A) and 0.5% formic acid 84% acetonitrile (solvent B) with 5–15% B in 10 min, 15–20% B in 10 min, 20–50% B in 70 min, and 50–100% B in 5 min. The flow rate was adjusted from 200 μl/min to 160 nl/min using a precolumn split. Eluting peptides were transferred online to a heated capillary (Pico Tip™, FS360-20-10, New Objective Inc., Cambridge, MA) of an ion trap mass spectrometer (LCQ™ Classic, Thermo Finnigan). The following electrospray ionization parameters were used: spray voltage, 1.8–2.15 kV; capillary temperature, 200 °C; capillary voltage, 42 V; tube lens offset voltage, 30 V; and the electron multiplier at –950 V. The collision energy was set automatically depending on the mass of the parent ion. Gain control was set to 107. The data were collected in the centroid mode using one MS experiment (Full-MS) followed by three MS/MS experiments of the three most intensive ions (intensity at least 3 × 105). “Dynamic exclusion” was used for data acquisition with an exclusion duration of 5 min and an exclusion mass width of ± 1.5 Da. Aldosterone RIA—Aldosterone concentration in the culture medium was determined by RIA using a commercially available aldosterone kit (DPC Biermann, Bad Nauheim, Germany). Statistical Analysis—The data shown were pooled from at least triplicate experiments. Values are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Differences between groups were analyzed by Student's t test. Analysis of variance was used for the dose-response experiments. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Localization of PKGs in Adrenal Gland and Experiments on Low Sodium Diet—In adrenal cortex PKG II is localized in ZG cells (Fig. 1, A and B), whereas localization of PKG I is restricted to the adrenal capsule and blood vessels (Fig. 1, C and D). Low sodium intake resulted in the activation of the reninangiotensin system, increase of plasma aldosterone levels, hyperplasia and hypertrophy of ZG cells, and an increase of cytochrome P450 aldosterone synthase activity, and StAR protein expression (27Lehoux J.G.

In our experiments a low sodium diet activated the expression of PKG II, whereas the expression levels of PKG I and the C-subunit of PKA did not change during the experiment. The increase in PKG II expression was restricted to the ZG and was not observed in adrenal medulla (Fig. 2). Low sodium diet also increased PKG II-positive cells in ZG without changing PKG I expression and localization (Figs. 1 and 2).Fig. 2A low sodium diet activated the expression of PKG II in rat adrenal cortex but not adrenal medulla. Adrenal capsule with ZG (adrenal cortex) and remaining tissues, including zona fasciculata and reticularis, and adrenal medulla (adrenal medulla) were separated from control and low sodium diet-fed rats as described under “Experimental Procedures” and processed for Western blot analysis. A 5-day low sodium diet strongly activated expression of PKG II but not PKG I and the C-subunit of PKA only in ZG.

Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3594-3601Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Therefore, in our experiments we used selective PKG activator (8-pCPT-cGMP) and inhibitor (Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS) in concentrations that do not affect phosphodiesterases (30Butt E. Nolte C. Schulz S. Beltman J. Beavo J.A. Jastorff B. Walter U. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 2591-2600Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The absolute values of aldosterone production were consistent with published results; however, the values are expressed as percent or -fold increase from control to compare data from different cell preparations. In freshly isolated ZG cells activation of PKG II stimulated and inhibition of PKG II inhibited basal aldosterone production dose-dependently (Fig. 3A). The inhibitory effect of Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS on aldosterone production was mimicked by ODQ, the inhibitor of soluble guanylyl cyclase (Fig. 3B). To investigate whether PKG II effects on aldosterone production are independent of other stimuli the following experiments were performed on freshly isolated ZG cells in which the aldosterone production was stimulated by ACTH, forskolin, or Ang II. Stimulation of ZG cells with ACTH or forskolin resulted in ∼6-fold, and with Ang II ∼3-fold, increase of aldosterone production. Further activation of PKG II with 8-pCPT-cGMP, like in the experiments on basal aldosterone production (compare with Fig. 3A), is enhancing stimulated aldosterone production (138 ± 7% for ACTH, 134 ± 6% for forskolin, and 145 ± 8% for Ang II, p < 0.05). Inhibition of PKG II with Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS is inhibiting stimulated aldosterone production (69 ± 7% for ACTH, 70 ± 6% for forskolin, and 64 ± 5% for Ang II, p < 0.05) (Fig. 3C), indicating that PKG II effects in ZG cells are independent from other stimuli. cGMP Analogs Had No Effect on Aldosterone Production from NCI Cells—To demonstrate that specific effects of cGMP analogs on aldosterone production are mediated by PKG II, NCI cells, a cell line that secretes aldosterone in a regulated manner and does not express PKG II (Fig 4A), were used in the same way as rat ZG cells experiments. 8-pCPT-cGMP and Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS in the same concentrations (100, 300, and 500 μm) had no effect on aldosterone production (Fig 4B). Forskolin stimulated aldosterone production 6.5 ± 1.8-fold (values comparable with rat ZG cells), however, in contrast to rat ZG cells (Fig. 3C) 8-pCPT-cGMP and Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS (500 μm) had no additional effects on forskolin-stimulated aldosterone production (Fig. 4C). Gene Transfer of PKG II Enhanced cGMP-dependent Aldosterone Production from ZG Cells—To obtain direct evidence that PKG II stimulates aldosterone production, ZG cells were infected with adenoviral vectors expressing either wild type PKG II (PKG II-WT) or, as control, a catalytically inactive PKG II-K482A mutant. Overexpression of PKG II-WT greatly increased the ability of 8-pCPT-cGMP to stimulate aldosterone production. In contrast, the aldosterone production caused by 8-pCPT-cGMP stimulation of endogenous PKG II was suppressed by overexpression of the catalytically inactive PKG II-K482A mutant. Overexpression of PKG II-WT and PKG II-K482A had no effect on forskolin-stimulated aldosterone production (Fig. 5, upper panel) and, thus, apparently did not affect PKA-mediated effects of cAMP elevated by forskolin. Western blot analyses confirmed these conclusions. Western blots (Fig. 5, PKG II Western blot) demonstrated the amount of endogenous PKG II in ZG cells and the higher amounts of overexpressed PKG II-WT and mutant PKG II-K482A. The activity of PKA and PKG II was examined by VASP phosphorylation using the phosphorylation-specific antibody, which recognized VASP only when it is phosphorylated at Ser239 (Fig. 5, P-VASP Western blot). Phosphorylation of VASP at Ser157 altered the apparent molecular mass of VASP in SDS-PAGE from 46 to 50 kDa (double band in Fig. 4, P-VASP Western blot). Overexpression of PKG II-K482A had no effect on PKA activity (forskolin bands on P-VASP Western blot, Fig. 5), and inhibitory effect of PKG II-K482A correlates with inhibition of PKG II activity (Fig. 5, P-VASP Western blot). In Vitro Phosphorylation of StAR Protein by PKG II and Identification of Phosphorylation Sites—Activation of steroidogenesis and aldosterone production by ACTH is directly correlated with phosphorylation of StAR protein by PKA (3Arakane F. King S.R. Du Y. Kallen C.B. Walsh L.P. Watari H. Stocco D.M. Strauss III, J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32656-32662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). To investigate whether PKG II-stimulated aldosterone production from ZG cells also correlated with StAR protein phosphorylation and whether StAR is a substrate for PKG II, we cloned the full-length StAR cDNA from rat adrenal gland and overexpressed it as a GST fusion protein in HEK-293 cells. After purification recombinant StAR protein was phosphorylated by the catalytic subunit of PKA and by PKG II. After exposure of the membrane, StAR protein was identified by Western blot analysis (Fig. 6). Incorporation of phosphate with approximately similar levels was observed after 30 min of incubation with both kinases. For identification of PKG II and PKA phosphorylation sites, rat StAR cDNA was cloned in PGEX4T1 vector, and, after protein purification, it was phosphorylated in vitro by PKA and PKG II. Rat StAR contains several PKA and PKG consensus motifs for serine phosphorylation: serine 55/56 (RRRSS), serine 99 (KKES), serine 195 (KRRGS), and serine 276 (KRKLES). In the present study, phosphorylation of amino acids was determined by mass spectrometry. A complete trypsin digest of StAR, phosphorylated by either PKA or PKG, was fractionated on a nano-HPLC connected online to an ion-trap mass spectrometer. The resulting MS/MS spectra of the phosphopeptides of rat StAR phosphorylated by PKA led to the unequivocal identification of serine 55/56 and serine 194 in rat StAR, corresponding to the human serine 56/57 and serine 195 phosphorylation sites described earlier (3Arakane F. King S.R. Du Y. Kallen C.B. Walsh L.P. Watari H. Stocco D.M. Strauss III, J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32656-32662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In addition, another yet unknown phosphorylation site at serine 276 was detected. This site is not conserved among all species and absent, for example, in mouse.

All-trans retinoic acid (RA) is a potent inhibitor of MCF-7 cell proliferation, but the mechanism by which growth regulation is achieved remains unclear. We investigated the effects of RA on the regulation of the IGF-IR and its key signaling elements: IRS-1, IRS-2, and SHC. Treatment of MCF-7 cells with RA caused a significant reduction in IRS-1 protein and tyrosine phosphorylation levels at a concentration and time consistent with RA-mediated growth inhibition. IRS-1 regulation is selective, as RA did not influence IRS-2 or SHC levels. Downstream signaling events were also selectively reduced, as RA abrogated IGF-I-stimulated AKT activation but did not alter erk1/2 activation. To confirm the importance of IRS-1 regulation by RA, we examined the response to RA in MCF-7 cells overexpressing IGF-IR and IRS-1. RA resistance was observed in MCF-7 cells overexpressing IRS-1 but not IGF-IR. This suggests that RA-mediated growth inhibition requires the selective downregulation of IRS-1 and AKT. Therapeutic agents targeting the IRS-1/PI 3-kinase/AKT pathway may enhance the cytostatic effects of RA in breast cancer, since overexpression of IRS-1 and AKT have been reported in primary breast tumors."
https://openalex.org/W1999946768,"Interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 are two structurally and functionally related cytokines that have overlapping but also distinct biological activities. One of the components of the IL-13 receptor, the alpha2 chain (IL-13Ralpha2), has been reported to downregulate the cell responsiveness to IL-13, without affecting IL-4 signaling. Here, we report that TNFalpha synergizes with either IL-4 or IL-13 in inducing the IL-13Ralpha2 chain at both the mRNA and protein levels in the HaCaT human keratinocyte cell line. Further studies by 5'RACE identified as yet undescribed exonic sequences of the IL-13Ralpha2 5'UTR, provided evidence for the expression of alternatively spliced IL-13Ralpha2 transcripts and defined the transcription start of the IL-13Ralpha2 gene. A 1.5 kb region upstream of the first exon of the IL-13Ralpha2 gene displayed basal promoter activity when inserted in a reporter plasmid and transiently transfected in HaCaT cells. This promoter activity was further increased in response to IL-4 and IL-13. Furthermore, by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and site-directed mutagenesis, we showed that the IL-4/IL-13-induced promoter activity depended upon a positively acting STAT6 response element. Finally, TNFalpha was shown to potentiate IL-4/IL-13-induced IL-13Ralpha2 promoter activity when the same reporter construct was studied in stably but not in transiently transfected cells. These results suggest that the synergistic effect of TNFalpha on IL-4/IL-13-induced IL-13Ralpha2 expression is dependent upon chromatin re-modeling events."

https://openalex.org/W2005582973,"At physiological concentrations, low density lipoprotein (LDL) increases the sensitivity of platelets to aggregation- and secretion-inducing agents without acting as an independent activator of platelet functions. LDL sensitizes platelets by inducing a transient activation of p38MAPK, a Ser/Thr kinase that is activated by the simultaneous phosphorylation of Thr180 and Tyr182 and is an upstream regulator of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2). A similar transient phosphorylation of p38MAPK is induced by a peptide mimicking amino acids 3359–3369 in apoB100 called the B-site. Here we report that the transient nature of p38MAPK activation is caused by platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1), a receptor with an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif. PECAM-1 activation by cross-linking induces tyrosine phosphorylation of PECAM-1 and a fall in phosphorylated p38MAPK and cPLA2. Interestingly, LDL and the B-site peptide also induce tyrosine phosphorylation of PECAM-1, and studies with immunoprecipitates indicate the involvement of c-Src. Inhibition of the Ser/Thr phosphatases PP1/PP2A (okadaic acid) makes the transient p38MAPK activation by LDL and the B-site peptide persistent. Inhibition of Tyr-phosphatases (vanadate) increases Tyr-phosphorylated PECAM-1 and blocks the activation of p38MAPK. Together, these findings suggest that, following a first phase in which LDL, through its B-site, phosphorylates and thereby activates p38MAPK, a second phase is initiated in which LDL activates PECAM-1 and induces dephosphorylation of p38MAPK via activation of the Ser/Thr phosphatases PP1/PP2A.

Blood. 1984; 64: 365-374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Part of this sensitization is mediated via activation of p38MAPK and cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), which, together with a second stimulus, leads to more liberation of arachidonic acid and the formation of thromboxane A2 (1Surya I.I. Gorter G. Mommersteeg M. Akkerman J.W.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1165: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 6Hackeng C.M. Relou I.A. Pladet M.W. Gorter G. van Rijn H.J. Akkerman J.W. Thromb. Haemost. 1999; 82: 1749-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A second mechanism involved in sensitization is the activation of p125 focal adhesion kinase (FAK) with its still poorly characterized effects on the formation of focal adhesions and cytoskeletal rearrangements (7Hackeng C.M.

Acta. 2001; 1540: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Activation of p38MAPK by LDL is rapid (within 10 s at 1 gram/liter LDL) and occurs at LDL concentrations within the physiological range (0.6–1 gram/liter LDL), suggesting that it may affect platelets in the circulation during diet-induced changes in the lipoprotein profile. p38MAPK is a member of the family of proline-directed serine/threonine kinases that is activated by the simultaneous phosphorylation of Thr180 and Tyr182 (9Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2040) Google Scholar, 10Ono K. Han J. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar). LDL-induced p38MAPK activation is insensitive to many inhibitors of signal transduction in platelets including the Ca2+ chelator 1,2-bis(2-amino phenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA), suggesting that it is an early step in the activation cascade initiated by LDL (6Hackeng C.M. Relou I.A. Pladet M.W. Gorter G. van Rijn H.J. Akkerman J.W. Thromb. Haemost. 1999; 82: 1749-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). An exception is an increase in cAMP, which is a potent inhibitor of p38MAPK activation (6Hackeng C.M. Relou I.A. Pladet M.W. Gorter G. van Rijn H.J. Akkerman J.W. Thromb. Haemost. 1999; 82: 1749-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The receptor through which LDL initiates p38MAPK and FAK activation in platelets has not yet been characterized but is probably not identical to the classical apoB/E receptor that mediates LDL uptake in fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells, because an antibody directed against the ligand binding domain of the classical LDL-receptor does not change the binding of LDL to platelets (11Pedreno J. de Castellarnau C. Cullare C. Sanchez J. Gomez Gerique J. Ordonez Llanos J. Gonzalez Sastre F. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1992; 12: 1353-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 12Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4343) Google Scholar). Furthermore, LDL binding to platelets is normal in platelets from patients with familial hypercholesterolemia who lack the apoB/E receptor (11Pedreno J. de Castellarnau C. Cullare C. Sanchez J. Gomez Gerique J. Ordonez Llanos J. Gonzalez Sastre F. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1992; 12: 1353-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We have recently identified an activating domain in LDL that induces p38MAPK activation in platelets (13Relou I.A.M. Gorter G. van Rijn H.J. Akkerman J.W.N. Thromb. Haemost. 2002; 87: 880-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The major apolipoprotein of LDL is apoB100, a 4563-amino acid-long protein that is wrapped around the lipid particle and possesses a recognition site for the apoB/E receptor in the so called B-site (14Boren J. Lee I. Zhu W. Arnold K. Taylor S. Innerarity T.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1084-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). A B-site peptide mimetic consisting of 11 amino-acids with a strong positive charge induced a rapid phosphorylation of p38MAPK, reaching a peak value after 30 s and returning to pre-stimulation values 5–10 min later (13Relou I.A.M. Gorter G. van Rijn H.J. Akkerman J.W.N. Thromb. Haemost. 2002; 87: 880-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The extent of p38MAPK activation was in the range found with 1 gram/liter LDL, and the sensitivity to inhibitors of the signaling steps also resembled that of LDL. This is an important observation, because variations between donors, a long isolation procedure, and, specifically, its susceptibility to oxidative modification have led to conflicting interpretations with respect to the platelet-activating properties of LDL (15Malle E. Sattler W. Platelets. 1994; 5: 70-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Because platelet sensitization by LDL might be one of the factors that contribute to the development of thrombo-atherosclerotic disease, its down-regulation is equally important as it prevents persistent platelet sensitization. At present, there is little insight into this mechanism. The presence of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1 or CD31) is of specific interest because its cytoplasmic tail contains a so-called immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM), which is a characteristic of receptors that mediate inhibitory signals (16Newman P.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 17Newton-Nash D.K. Newman P.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 682-688PubMed Google Scholar, 18Patil S. Newman D.K. Newman P.J. Blood. 2001; 97: 1727-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The ITIM family comprises several members such as PECAM-1, FcγRIIb, signal-regulating protein, CD22, and killer inhibitory receptor; of these, only PECAM-1 is present on human platelets (16Newman P.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 19DeLisser H.M. Newman P.J. Albelda S.M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1993; 184: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). PECAM-1 is a 130-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules (20Newman P.J. Berndt M.C. Gorski J. White G.C. Lyman S. Paddock C. Muller W.A. Science. 1990; 247: 1219-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Its 574-amino acid extracellular domain is organized into six Ig-like homology domains (21Guselnikov S.V. Ershova S.A. Mechetina L.V. Najakshin A.M. Volkova O.Y. Alabyev B.Y. Taranin A.V. Immunogenetics. 2002; 54: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). There is a single transmembrane domain and a 118-amino acid cytoplasmic tail. The ITIM motif is characterized by the consensus sequence (L/I/V/S)XYXX(L/V) (16Newman P.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The expression of PECAM-1 is restricted to hematopoietic and vascular cell types such as platelets, monocytes, neutrophils, and endothelial cells (20Newman P.J. Berndt M.C. Gorski J. White G.C. Lyman S. Paddock C. Muller W.A. Science. 1990; 247: 1219-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). The functions of PECAM-1 are diverse and include roles in angiogenesis, vasculogenesis, integrin regulation, and the transendothelial migration of leukocytes (22DeLisser H.M. Newman P.J. Albelda S.M. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 490-495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The activation of PECAM-1 is accompanied by phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic part of the molecule. The cytoplasmic tail of PECAM-1 contains twelve serine, four threonine, and five tyrosine residues (20Newman P.J. Berndt M.C. Gorski J. White G.C. Lyman S. Paddock C. Muller W.A. Science. 1990; 247: 1219-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Which of these residues are phosphorylated depends on the type of agonist. Both resting and thrombin receptor activating peptide (TRAP)-stimulated platelets show predominantly serine phosphorylation of PECAM-1, provided that the cells do not aggregate. When suspensions are stirred and aggregates are formed, PECAM-1 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated (23Modderman P.W. von dem Borne A.E. Sonnenberg A. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 613-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The contact of platelets with collagen leads to strong PECAM-1 phosphorylation on tyrosine residues (24Jackson D.E. Ward C.M. Wang R. Newman P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6986-6993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). A second means to activate PECAM-1 in platelets is by cross-linking with the specific antibody PECAM-1.3, which results in tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tail. Upon receptor activation, the cytoplasmic ITIM-motif recruits and activates a Src-homology 2 (SH2) domain containing protein-tyrosine phosphatases such as SHP-1 and SHP-2 (25Hua C.T. Gamble J.R. Vadas M.A. Jackson D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28332-28340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Both SHP-1 and SHP-2 are essential components in PECAM-1-mediated generation of inhibitory signals, and their recruitment and activation depend on the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on the PECAM-1 cytoplasmic tail (26Henshall T.L. Jones K.L. Wilkinson R. Jackson D.E. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 3098-3106Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Earlier studies have shown that p38MAPK activation by the B-site in LDL is maximal after 1–2 min and is followed by a gradual decline to pre-activation values. In the present study we investigated whether PECAM-1 takes part in the down-regulation of LDL-induced p38MAPK activation. Furthermore, we determined whether the down-regulation of p38MAPK activation was mediated by the action of phosphatases.

Human α-thrombin was purchased from Kordia Life Science (Leiden, The Netherlands) The peptide RLTRKRGLKLA (molecular weight, 1311), designated the B-site peptide, represents the apoB receptor-binding domain (Arg3359 to Ala3369) of apoB100. The peptide was synthesized by standard solid-phase peptide synthesis and purified by C18 reverse-phase chromatography (HPLC, Genosphere Biotechnologies, Paris, France). The purity of the peptide was >99% as determined by high pressure liquid chromatography, and the molecular weight was verified by matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry by the manufacturer. Lipoprotein Isolation—Lipoproteins were isolated as described previously (27Hackeng C.M. Huigsloot M. Pladet M.W. Nieuwenhuis H.K. van Rijn H.J. Akkerman J.W.N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

In short, fresh, non-frozen plasma from four healthy subjects each containing less than 100 mg of lipoprotein(a) per liter was pooled, and LDL (density range, 1.019–1.063 kg/liter) was isolated by sequential flotation in a Beckman L-70 ultracentrifuge. Centrifugations (20 h; 17,5000 × g; 10 °C) were carried out in the presence of NaN3 and EDTA. The LDL preparations contained only minimal amounts of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) (0.20 ± 0.07 nmol/mg), lipid peroxides (6.7 ± 1.9 nmol/mg), and contaminating plasma proteins (below or within reported values for native LDL). Lp(a) concentrations, determined with the use of a specific antibody (Apotech, Organon Technika), were below 14 mg/liter. Lipoproteins were stored at 4 °C under nitrogen for no longer than 14 days, and before each experiment they were dialyzed overnight against 104 volumes of 150 mmol/liter NaCl. ApoB100 and lipoprotein(a) concentrations were measured using the Behring Nephelometer 100. The concentration of LDL was expressed as grams of apoB100 protein per liter. Platelet Isolation—Freshly drawn venous blood from healthy volunteers was collected with informed consent into 130 mmol/liter trisodium citrate (1:10, v/v). The donors claimed not to have taken any medication during the 2 weeks prior to blood collection. Platelet-rich plasma was prepared by centrifugation (200 × g; 15 min; 20 °C). Gel-filtered platelets were isolated by gel filtration through Sepharose 2B equilibrated in Ca2+-free Tyrode's solution (137 mmol/liter NaCl, 2.68 mmol/liter KCl, 0.42 mmol/liter NaH2PO4, 1.7 mmol/liter MgCl2, and 11.9 mmol/liter NaHCO3, pH 7.25) containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin and 5 mmol/liter glucose. Gel-filtered platelets were adjusted to a final count of 2 × 1011 platelets/liter and incubated with LDL and other agonists with and without stirring (900 rev·min–1) at 37 °C as indicated under “Results.” Measurement of p38MAPK and cPLA2—Gel-filtered platelets were incubated at 37 °C with LDL, B-site peptide, or thrombin as indicated. After incubation, 100-μl aliquots were mixed (1:10, v/v) with cold lysis buffer (radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 10% protease inhibitor mixture and 5 mm NaVO3) and subsequently taken up in Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were heated prior to SDS-PAGE (12%). Proteins were electrophoretically transferred (1 h; 100 volts) to a nitrocellulose membrane using a mini-protean system (Bio-Rad). The blots were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline (1 h; 4 °C) and incubated with the PhosphoPlus p38MAPK (Thr180/Tyr182) or p38MAPK antibody (1:2000 in 1% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Tween in PBS; 16 h; 4 °C). Both antibodies are raised against residues 171–186 of human p38MAPK. After washing, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit (1:2000; 1 h; 4 °C), and p38MAPK was visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence reaction. For semi-quantitative determination of the amount of dual phosphorylated or total p38MAPK, the density of the bands was analyzed using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). For the measurement of cPLA2 phosphorylation, samples were withdrawn and collected in Laemmli sample buffer. Measurement of cPLA2 was based on the mobility shift on SDS-PAGE that accompanies phosphorylation of the protein (28Hackeng C.M. Franke B. Relou I.A. Gorter G. Bos J.L. van Rijn H.J. Akkerman J.W. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 231-238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The running buffer for electrophoresis of cPLA2 was pH 8.3. cPLA2 was detected using the monoclonal antibody 4-4B-3C. Immune complexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. PECAM-1 Tyrosine Phosphorylation and Coprecipitation with PP2A—Platelets were incubated with LDL, the B-site peptide, or thrombin as indicated (37 °C). After incubation, 500-μl aliquots were mixed with cold lysis buffer (1:10, v/v) as described above and precipitated with goat polyclonal anti-PECAM-1 (1 μg) and protein G-Sepharose for 3 h (4 °C). After washing with lysis buffer, samples were taken up in Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were heated (5 min; 100 °C) prior to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7.5%) and the Western blotting procedure. The blots were blocked in 5% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (1 h; 4 °C) and incubated with monoclonal 4G10 antibody (1:2000 in 1% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20 in TBS; 16 h; 4 °C) or polyclonal SEW antibody (1:2000 in 1% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20 in TBS; 16 h; 4 °C). Co-immunoprecipitation of PP2 was determined by incubating the blots with the anti-PP2A antibody (1: 1000 in 1% BSA and 0.05% Tween in TBS; 16 h; 4 °C). After washing, the membranes were incubated with peroxidase-linked anti-mouse (1: 5000; 1 h; 4 °C) or anti-rabbit IgG (1:10000; 1 h; 4 °C), and phosphorylation was visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence reaction. Statistics—Data are expressed as means ± S.D. with the number of observations (n). PECAM-1 Inhibits LDL-induced Phosphorylation of p38MAPK—LDL (1 gram/liter) induced a rapid phosphorylation of p38MAPK, reaching a peak value after 30 s and returning to pre-stimulation values after 10–20 min (Fig. 1A, left panel). Thus, following a first phosphorylation step, phosphatases were activated that brought p38MAPK back to the range found in resting platelets. This dephosphorylation of p38MAPK is distinctly faster than that observed with LDL preparations isolated in the presence of the anti-bacterial agent thimerosal, which was commonly used in earlier studies (6Hackeng C.M. Relou I.A. Pladet M.W. Gorter G. van Rijn H.J. Akkerman J.W. Thromb. Haemost. 1999; 82: 1749-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 29Weidtmann A. Scheithe R. Hrboticky N. Pietsch A. Lorenz R. Siess W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1131-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Thus, following an initial phase in which p38MAPK was phosphorylated, both LDL and a peptide mimetic of the B-site of apoB100 (13Relou I.A.M. Gorter G. van Rijn H.J. Akkerman J.W.N. Thromb. Haemost. 2002; 87: 880-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) induced dephosphorylation of p38MAPK, bringing the enzyme back to the state found in resting platelets. To investigate whether PECAM-1 played a role in the dephosphorylation of p38MAPK, the receptor was activated with the antibody PECAM-1.3, which is specific for the ectodomain of PECAM-1. Incubation of platelets with this antibody (1 μg/ml) for 10 min resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of PECAM-1, illustrating that the receptor was activated (Fig. 1A, right panel). No further activation of PECAM-1 was found by cross-linking the PECAM-1.3 antibody with anti-mouse Fab fragments. When platelets were first treated with the PECAM-1.3 antibody for 10 min and thereafter stimulated with LDL (1 gram/liter) for 1 min, the phosphorylation of p38MAPK was reduced to 70% compared with platelets that were not treated with the PECAM-1.3 antibody (Fig. 1B). A further cross-linking of PECAM-1 resulted in a reduction in phosphorylation of p38MAPK to 40%. A similar inhibition by PECAM was observed at the level of cPLA2, which is a downstream target of p38MAPK in LDL-induced signaling (6Hackeng C.M. Relou I.A. Pladet M.W. Gorter G. van Rijn H.J. Akkerman J.W. Thromb. Haemost. 1999; 82: 1749-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To assess a possible involvement of the FcγRIIa receptor-mediated pathway in the anti-PECAM-1.3-induced activation of PECAM-1 and the concomitant dephosphorylation of p38MAPK, studies were repeated in the presence of antibody IV.3, an inhibitor of FcγRIIa (data not shown). The inhibition by PECAM-1 activation was unchanged. This observation, together with literature data that show that p38MAPK is activated by FcγRIIa activation rather than inhibited by it illustrate that the inhibition by PECAM of LDL-induced p38MAPK phosphorylation is independent of FcγRIIa. LDL Activates PECAM-1—The observation that PECAM inhibited the LDL-induced phosphorylation of p38MAPK raised the question of whether LDL itself was capable of activating PECAM-1, thereby down-regulating the initial activation of p38MAPK-activating pathways. Platelets were incubated with LDL, and the phosphorylation of PECAM-1 was visualized on Western blots after immunoprecipitation of the receptor (Fig. 2A). As a control, platelets were stimulated with thrombin (0.5 units/ml; 2 min; 37 °C) with and without stirring. Stirring resulted in an enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of PECAM-1, whereas serine phosphorylation was equal under both conditions, which was in agreement with earlier observations (23Modderman P.W. von dem Borne A.E. Sonnenberg A. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 613-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Western blots with an appropriate antibody revealed that LDL induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PECAM-1 but was incapable of inducing phosphorylation of serine residues. The LDL (1 gram/liter)-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PECAM-1 was transient, showing a maximum after 1 min of stimulation and down-regulation after prolonged incubation (Fig. 2B). Also, the B-site peptide induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PECAM-1, which is in line with the concept that the B-site mediates the activation of PECAM-1 by LDL. After immunoprecipitation of PECAM-1, an additional band at ∼125 kDa was co-precipitated. Reprobing of the blots with the polyclonal anti-PECAM-1 (SEW) and an antibody against focal adhesion kinase revealed that the upper band represents PECAM-1 and the lower band focal adhesion kinase (data not shown). The inhibitor of Src kinases, PP1 (10 μm), abrogated tyrosine phosphorylation of PECAM-1, suggesting a role for Src kinases (Fig. 2C). Indeed, upon LDL stimulation, a 60-kDa band co-precipitated with PECAM-1 upon LDL stimulation. After reprobing with a specific antibody, this band could be identified as c-Src, indicating that a complex was formed between c-Src and PECAM-1 upon stimulation by LDL. Down-regulation of LDL Signaling by PECAM-1 Depends on Serine/Threonine Phosphatases—PECAM-1 is known to initiate inhibitory signaling pathways by recruitment of the tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2. As p38MAPK is activated upon phosphorylation of both threonine and tyrosine residues, the involvement of serine/threonine phosphatases as well as tyrosine phosphatases was investigated. To investigate the contribution of serine/threonine phosphatases, platelets were incubated for 0.5 min with 1 μm okadaic acid, a concentration known to inhibit the serine/threonine phosphatases PP1 and PP2A (30Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2151) Google Scholar, 31Haystead T.A. Sim A.T. Carling D. Honnor R.C. Tsukitani Y. Cohen P. Hardie D.G. Nature. 1989; 337: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). This treatment resulted in a strong potentiation of p38MAPK activation by LDL (1 gram/liter) and the B-site peptide (100 μm) and changed the transient activation into a more sustained activation compared with LDL-stimulated p38MAPK in the absence of the inhibitor (Fig. 3A). We next investigated whether inhibition of tyrosine phosphatases with vanadate interfered with the phosphorylation state of p38MAPK. Platelets were preincubated for 30 min with 100 μm sodium vanadate. This treatment completely abolished the phosphorylation of p38MAPK by LDL and the B-site peptide (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, the tyrosine phosphorylation of PECAM-1 induced by LDL and the B-site peptide was preserved by vanadate treatment and even increased to levels above the range found in the absence of the inhibitor (Fig. 3C). Thus, inhibition of tyrosine phosphatases augmented the Tyr phosphorylation of PECAM-1 induced by LDL and the B-site peptide, thereby potentiating the dephosphorylation of p38MAPK to such an extent that any rise in phosphorylated p38MAPK was prevented. A combination of the two inhibitors induced a dual response. During the first 5 min there was complete inhibition of p38MAPK phosphorylation as observed with vanadate alone. Thereafter, a slight recovery became detectable, but the recovery was later and considerably lower than that seen with okadaic acid alone (Fig. 4A). Thus, following a period in which inhibition by vanadate was predominant, a second phase became apparent in which dephosphorylation of p38MAPK by PECAM-1 was opposed by okadaic acid. Concurrent analysis of PECAM-1 phosphorylation showed that, in the period of p38MAPK inhibition, PECAM-1 was maximally phosphorylated. The later recovery of p38MAPK phosphorylation was accompanied by a fall of phosphorylated PECAM-1, which was slightly faster than in the presence of vanadate alone (Fig. 4B). Because the effect of okadaic acid on the dephosphorylation of p38MAPK suggested the involvement of a phosphatase of the PP1/PP2a type, a possible co-association between PECAM-1 and PP2A was investigated. Stimulation by LDL induced a transient co-association between Tyr-phosphorylated PECAM-1 and PP2A, supporting the conclusion that PECAM-1 regulates dephosphorylation of p38MAPK through PP2A (Fig. 5). ApoB100 is the main protein constituent of LDL and consists of 4563 amino acids wrapped around the lipid particle. The B-site is the domain in apoB100 that binds to the apoB/E receptors on cells that remove plasma cholesterol from the circulation. A peptide that mimics this region between Arg3359 and Ala3369 of apoB100 induced a transient activation of platelet p38MAPK, showing a maximal phosphorylation after 1 min of stimulation (13Relou I.A.M. Gorter G. van Rijn H.J. Akkerman J.W.N. Thromb. Haemost. 2002; 87: 880-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Also, LDL induced a rapid and transient phosphorylation of p38MAPK with approximately similar kinetics as observed with the B-site peptide. It is possible that this down-regulation at prolonged incubation times might reflect a protection mechanism that prevents extensive platelet activation in the circulation by LDL. Here we report that the down-regulation of phosphorylated p38MAPK is mediated by PECAM-1. PECAM-1 activation by a specific receptor cross-linking antibody led to Tyr-phosphorylation of PECAM-1 and p38MAPK dephosphorylation. A second cross-linking Fab fragment in addition to the PECAM-1 antibody did not induce much more PECAM-1 tyrosine phosphorylation, although literature data suggest that Fab fragments are required for optimal PECAM-1 activation (32Cicmil M. Thomas J.M. Leduc M. Bon C. Gibbins J.M. Blood. 2002; 99: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Activation of PECAM-1 with the PECAM-1.3 antibody resulted in a decrease in LDL-induced phosphorylation of p38MAPK, and a further activation of PECAM with additional Fab fragments led to a further reduction in the phosphorylation of the enzyme. These observations make PECAM-1 an important inhibitor of LDL-induced p38MAPK phosphorylation. P38MAPK is activated by dual phosphorylation of the p38MAPK of Thr180 and Tyr182, and the inhibition by PECAM-1 is therefore likely to impair further signaling to downstream effectors. Indeed, activation of PECAM-1 also inhibits the phosphorylation of cPLA2, which is a key step in the mobilization of arachidonic acid and the further formation of thromboxane A2. This makes PECAM-1 a key factor in the control of LDL-induced platelet sensitization. There is little insight into the mechanisms by which PECAM-1 is activated under physiological conditions. The activation of PECAM-1 could be the result of agonists present in the circulation that induce a protection mechanism against cardiovascular complications. Platelet activation through the collagen receptor glycoprotein VI results in PECAM-1 tyrosine phosphorylation, which may function to negatively limit growth of platelet thrombi on collagen surfaces (18Patil S. Newman D.K. Newman P.J. Blood. 2001; 97: 1727-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 32Cicmil M. Thomas J.M. Leduc M. Bon C. Gibbins J.M.

Chem. 2000; 275: 27339-27347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, platelet activation through thrombin receptors leads to PECAM-1 activation. Activated non-aggregated platelets exhibit serine phosphorylation of PECAM-1 in contrast to aggregated platelets, which show tyrosine phosphorylated PECAM-1 (23Modderman P.W. von dem Borne A.E. Sonnenberg A. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 613-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The present experiments suggest a role for LDL as an agonist for PECAM-1-mediated platelet inhibition. Incubation of platelets with LDL or the B-site peptide induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PECAM-1 with an optimum after 2–5 min. Neither LDL nor the B-site peptide induced phosphorylation of serines on PECAM-1, which is in contrast to PECAM-1 stimulation by thrombin. Our data also reveal that in non-aggregated platelets PECAM-1 can be tyrosine phosphorylated, because LDL is not an aggregation-inducing agent. Upon incubation of platelets with LDL, a band with a slightly lower molecular weight compared with PECAM-1 co-precipitates with this receptor. This band interacted strongly with an antibody against focal adhesion kinase. LDL is a potent activator of focal adhesion kinase via the Src kinase Fgr and triggers the phosphorylation of the six tyrosine residues with kinetics that differ greatly form those induced by thrombin (35Relou I.A.M. Bax L.A.B. van Rijn H.J.M. Akkerman J.W.N. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 407-416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Okadaic acid is an inhibitor of the serine/threonine phosphatases PP1 and PP2A (36Fernandez J.J. Candenas M.L. Souto M.L. Trujillo M.M. Norte M. Curr. Med. Chem. 2002; 9: 229-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). When platelets were preincubated with this inhibitor, the transient phosphorylation of p38MAPK by LDL and the B-site peptide changed into a persistent activation and reached levels far above the maximal phosphorylation observed in untreated platelets. A recent study on p38MAPK phosphorylation by collagen revealed that PP2A mediates the dephosphorylation, and a similar role might be present in platelets stimulated by LDL (37Sundaresan P. Farndale R. FEBS Lett. 2002; 528: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). p38MAPK is activated by dual phosphorylation on tyrosine and threonine residues by dual specific MAPK kinases 3 and 6 (MKK3/6) (38Cuenda A. Alonso G. Morrice N. Jones M. Meier R. Cohen P. Nebreda A.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4156-4164Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 39Han J. Lee J.D. Jiang Y. Li Z. Feng L. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2886-2891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). MKK6 is activated by phosphorylation on Ser151 and Thr155 by an upstream enzyme termed MKK kinase. Thus, the dephosphorylation of p38MAPK by PP1/PP2A might be the result of a direct effect of these phosphatases on p38MAPK, but an indirect effect caused at the level of upstream kinases is equally feasible. Vanadate is an inhibitor of tyrosine phosphatases. When platelets were preincubated with this inhibitor, the transient tyrosine phosphorylation of PECAM-1 was increased and more sustained, enabling the receptor to transmit a stronger inhibitory signal into the cell. Apparently, vanadate did not increase the phosphorylated state of p38MAPK, although the enzyme is phosphorylated on threonine and tyrosine residues. Instead, vanadate treatment completely abolished the increase of phosphorylated p38MAPK by LDL and the B-site peptide. This illustrates the potent inhibitory action of PECAM-1, which, through its strong activation of PP1/PP2A, abolished the accumulation of phosphorylated p38MAPK. Also, when both inhibitors are present the inhibition by vanadate is predominant, and only after prolonged incubation with LDL does the effect of okadaic acid become detectable. Together, these results support the concept that PECAM-1 is a negative regulator of LDL-induced signaling in platelets by activating a phosphatase sensitive to okadaic acid. Indeed, immunoprecipitates reveal co-association with PP2A. Together with the coprecipitation of focal adhesion kinase (Ref. 35Relou I.A.M. Bax L.A.B. van Rijn H.J.M. Akkerman J.W.N. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 407-416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and this study), the Src-kinases Fgr (35Relou I.A.M. Bax L.A.B. van Rijn H.J.M. Akkerman J.W.N. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 407-416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and c-Src (this study), LDL-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PECAM appears central in the formation of a complex containing multiple signaling elements. Signal transduction by PECAM-1 depends on the ITIM motif, which becomes tyrosine phosphorylated. Because PECAM-1 does not appear to be autophosphorylated, a kinase is thought to phosphorylate the cytoplasmic tyrosine residue (40Cao M.Y. Huber M. Beauchemin N. Famiglietti J. Albelda S.M. Veillette A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15765-15772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 41Newman D.K. Hamilton C. Newman P.J. Blood. 2001; 97: 2351-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A candidate responsible for the tyrosine phosphorylation is a member of the Src family tyrosine kinase (34Cicmil M. Thomas J.M. Sage T. Barry F.A. Leduc M. Bon C. Gibbins J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27339-27347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Newman D.K. Hamilton C. Newman P.J. Blood. 2001; 97: 2351-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation studies after the incubation of platelets with LDL showed co-precipitation of c-Src with PECAM-1. P38MAPK activation was not affected by the okadaic acid treatment until the platelets had been stimulated with LDL for 1 min or more. This is in accordance with the time-dependent activation of PECAM-1 by LDL and the recruitment of c-Src. This suggests that c-Src recruitment to the cytoplasmic tail of PECAM-1 induces ITIM-tyrosine phosphorylation and the subsequent recruitment of PP2A. In conclusion, the results reported in this study are best explained by assuming a model in which LDL affects platelet signaling mechanisms in two phases. During the initial phase, LDL binds via its B-site in apoB100 to the putative LDL receptor on platelets, thereby inducing the dual phosphorylation of p38MAPK and activating the enzyme. This step leads to activation of cPLA2 and the formation of thromboxane A2. This mechanism explains why aspirin or related drugs abolish at least in part the sensitization of platelets by LDL. This activation phase is followed by a second phase in which LDL, either directly or bound in a complex with the LDL receptor, activates PECAM-1. This results in recruitment of c-Src and the phosphatases PP1/PP2A, thereby down-regulating the phosphorylation of p38MAPK."
https://openalex.org/W2053643386,"A highly specific t(8;13)(p11;q12) translocation has been consistently identified in bone marrow cells from patients with an atypical myeloproliferative disease that is associated with peripheral blood eosinophila and T- or B-cell leukemias. In all patients analysed to date, the translocation event results in a chimeric gene in which the atypical zinc-finger domain of ZNF198 is fused to the N-terminal end of the catalytic domain of the FGFR1 receptor tyrosine kinase. To understand more about the consequences of this rearrangement we have investigated the normal function of the ZNF198 gene. Using yeast two-hybrid analysis we identified HHR6 as a protein binding partner and confirmed this using immunoprecipitation studies. The ZNF198/FGFR1 fusion protein also binds to HHR6. We demonstrate here that the human RAD18 is also present in the ZNF198/HHR6 protein complex, although it does not coimmunoprecipitate with the fusion kinase. Cells expressing the fusion kinase gene show a marked increased sensitivity to UVB irradiation, suggesting that it acts in a dominant-negative way to affect DNA repair. These observations support the idea that ZNF198, through its interaction with HHR6 and RAD18, may be involved in the DNA repair process."
https://openalex.org/W1975664002,"In order to study the mechanisms of resistance to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), we have constructed two stable transfectants producing TNF-alpha (Yv12-2 and Yv13-44) from the rat hepatoma H4IIE cell, which does not produce TNF-alpha. H4IIE cells were highly sensitive to apoptosis induced by TNF-alpha, whereas Yv2-12 and Yv13-44 cells were resistant. Manganous superoxide dismutase was not up-regulated in Yv2-12 and Yv13-44 cells and was unresponsive to induction by exogenous TNF-alpha and by H2O2 in H4IIE cells and in the transfectants. Catalase expression and activity were lower in Yv2-12 and Yv13-44 cells than in H4IIE cells; furthermore, the transfectants were more susceptible to H2O2. Treatment with exogenous TNF-alpha down-regulated catalase in H4IIE cells but not in Yv2-12 and Yv13-44 cells. Treatment of H4IIE cells with the catalase inhibitor 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole rendered them resistant to exogenous TNF-alpha. These data suggest a causal relationship between resistance to TNF-alpha and low catalase activity. Expression of copper and zinc containing superoxide dismutase was also decreased, whereas expression of glutathione peroxidase-1 was unchanged in Yv2-12 and Yv13-44 cells. Data from a microarray point to a down-regulation of genes in the resistant clones that code for antioxidative proteins and proteins involved in glutathione synthesis and function. We assume that a prooxidant signal linked to the down-regulation of antioxidant defense may be associated with resistance to apoptosis induced by TNF-alpha."
https://openalex.org/W2004566025,"Heregulin (HRG) is an activator of the erbB2-, erbB3- and erbB4-(erbB-2/3/4) signaling pathway. Transfection of full-length HRG cDNA into the estrogen (E2)-dependent cell line MCF-7 promoted an invasive E2-independent phenotype, as well as persistent activation of the erbB-2/3/4 receptors. Moreover, HRG expression in MCF-7 cells renders the cells sensitive to the topoisomerase II inhibitor doxorubicin (Doxo). In an attempt to dissociate the tumorigenic effect of HRG from the sensitizing effect to chemotherapy, we constructed a structural deletion mutant of HRG. Transfection of the deletion mutant of HRG described in this study (HRG/M) into MCF-7 cells resulted in the dissociation of the tumor-promoting activity of HRG from the sensitization to Doxo, that is, although the cells did not become more aggressive or E2-independent they became more sensitive to Doxo. HRG/M was unable to autophosphorylate the erbB receptors and did not affect the level of MAPK phosphorylation. Furthermore, the intracellular localization of the protein was different from that of the full-length protein. Our data show that the HRG/M sequences are sufficient to sensitize MCF-7 cells to Doxo, and provide evidence that this sensitization is independent of erbB2 activation."
https://openalex.org/W2076819618,"To identify genes associated with the resistance of Copenhagen (Cop) rats to mammary carcinogenesis, we infused a retrovirus harboring v-Ha-ras directly into the main mammary ducts of resistant F1 rats from a cross between Cop and susceptible Wistar Furth (WF) rats. Adenocarcinomas formed in approximately 50% of infused glands. Cell lines derived from these tumors were clonal, but did not share a common viral integration site, suggesting that a high level of v-Ha-ras expression was able to overcome resistance in the F1 rats. Some of the cell lines were able to grow in soft agar, but a significant number did not display anchorage-independent growth. These growth characteristics were independent of v-Ha-ras expression levels. The ability to grow in soft agar was associated with the size of tumors induced by injecting the cells into nude mice, and showed a striking positive association with the expression of cyclin D1. Furthermore, while resistance to anchorage-independent growth was fully overcome by transfection of cyclin D1 in some clones, in the others the effect was partial. A similar pattern of cyclin D1 upregulation and growth in soft agar was also observed when the cells were transfected with an active form of beta-catenin. Hybrid cells from the somatic fusion of an anchorage-dependent to an anchorage-independent clone did not grow in soft agar. These results suggest that while a high expression level of cyclin D1 is necessary for anchorage-independent growth in all clones, it is not sufficient for full growth capacity in soft agar, raising the possibility that the loss of a tumor suppressor gene in the cell lines is required to fully confer anchorage-independent growth. Our anchorage-dependent and -independent rat mammary tumor-derived cell lines may recapitulate the resistance and susceptibility of Cop and WF rats, respectively, to mammary carcinogenesis that could facilitate the identification of breast cancer susceptibility genes."
