To date, robust systems to genetically manipulate these cells have not been developed. We report that Cre under control of the promoter of Pdgfrb (Pdgfrb-Cre) inactivates loxP-flanked genes in mouse HSCs with high efficiency. We used this system to delete the gene encoding α(v) integrin subunit because various α(v)-containing integrins have been suggested as central mediators of fibrosis in multiple organs. Such depletion protected mice from carbon tetrachloride-induced hepatic fibrosis, whereas global loss of β₃, β₅ or β₆ integrins or conditional loss of β₈ integrins in HSCs did not. We also found that Pdgfrb-Cre effectively targeted myofibroblasts in multiple organs, and depletion of the α(v) integrin subunit using this system was protective in other models of organ fibrosis, including pulmonary and renal fibrosis. Pharmacological blockade of α(v)-containing integrins by a small molecule (CWHM 12) attenuated both liver and lung fibrosis, including in a therapeutic manner. These data identify a core pathway that regulates fibrosis and suggest that pharmacological targeting of all α(v) integrins may have clinical utility in the treatment of patients with a broad range of fibrotic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1987371782,"A chromatin interaction analysis with paired-end tagging (ChIA-PET) approach is used to delineate chromatin interactions mediated by RNA polymerase II in several different stem-cell populations; putative long-range promoter–enhancer interactions are inferred, indicating that linear juxtaposition does not necessarily guide enhancer target selection and prevalent cell-specific enhancer usage. Gene transcription requires dynamic chromatin connectivity between promoters bound by RNA polymerase II and their corresponding distal-acting enhancers. In this paper the authors use the ChIA-PET (chromatin interaction analysis with paired-end tagging) approach to delineate chromatin interactions mediated by RNA polymerase II in embryonic stem cells, neural stem cells and neurosphere progenitor cells. Putative enhancer–promoter interactions can be inferred, and many enhancers associate with promoters located beyond their nearest active genes, indicating that linear juxtaposition does not necessarily guide enhancer target selection. This work illustrates the possible importance of underlying chromatin structures in nuclear function. In multicellular organisms, transcription regulation is one of the central mechanisms modelling lineage differentiation and cell-fate determination1. Transcription requires dynamic chromatin configurations between promoters and their corresponding distal regulatory elements2. It is believed that their communication occurs within large discrete foci of aggregated RNA polymerases termed transcription factories in three-dimensional nuclear space3. However, the dynamic nature of chromatin connectivity has not been characterized at the genome-wide level. Here, through a chromatin interaction analysis with paired-end tagging approach3,4,5 using an antibody that primarily recognizes the pre-initiation complexes of RNA polymerase II6, we explore the transcriptional interactomes of three mouse cells of progressive lineage commitment, including pluripotent embryonic stem cells7, neural stem cells8 and neurosphere stem/progenitor cells9. Our global chromatin connectivity maps reveal approximately 40,000 long-range interactions, suggest precise enhancer–promoter associations and delineate cell-type-specific chromatin structures. Analysis of the complex regulatory repertoire shows that there are extensive colocalizations among promoters and distal-acting enhancers. Most of the enhancers associate with promoters located beyond their nearest active genes, indicating that the linear juxtaposition is not the only guiding principle driving enhancer target selection. Although promoter–enhancer interactions exhibit high cell-type specificity, promoters involved in interactions are found to be generally common and mostly active among different cells. Chromatin connectivity networks reveal that the pivotal genes of reprogramming functions are transcribed within physical proximity to each other in embryonic stem cells, linking chromatin architecture to coordinated gene expression. Our study sets the stage for the full-scale dissection of spatial and temporal genome structures and their roles in orchestrating development."
https://openalex.org/W1973556785,"Andrew Hattersley, Jorge Ferrer and colleagues use epigenomic annotation of pancreatic progenitor cells to guide the interpretation of whole-genome sequences from individuals with isolated pancreatic agenesis. They show that recessive mutations in a distal developmental enhancer of PTF1A cause pancreatic agenesis and abolish enhancer activity. The contribution of cis-regulatory mutations to human disease remains poorly understood. Whole-genome sequencing can identify all noncoding variants, yet the discrimination of causal regulatory mutations represents a formidable challenge. We used epigenomic annotation in human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived pancreatic progenitor cells to guide the interpretation of whole-genome sequences from individuals with isolated pancreatic agenesis. This analysis uncovered six different recessive mutations in a previously uncharacterized ∼400-bp sequence located 25 kb downstream of PTF1A (encoding pancreas-specific transcription factor 1a) in ten families with pancreatic agenesis. We show that this region acts as a developmental enhancer of PTF1A and that the mutations abolish enhancer activity. These mutations are the most common cause of isolated pancreatic agenesis. Integrating genome sequencing and epigenomic annotation in a disease-relevant cell type can thus uncover new noncoding elements underlying human development and disease."

https://openalex.org/W2016966354,"Computational theories propose that attention modulates the topographical landscape of spatial 'priority' maps in regions of the visual cortex so that the location of an important object is associated with higher activation levels. Although studies of single-unit recordings have demonstrated attention-related increases in the gain of neural responses and changes in the size of spatial receptive fields, the net effect of these modulations on the topography of region-level priority maps has not been investigated. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging and a multivariate encoding model to reconstruct spatial representations of attended and ignored stimuli using activation patterns across entire visual areas. These reconstructed spatial representations reveal the influence of attention on the amplitude and size of stimulus representations within putative priority maps across the visual hierarchy. Our results suggest that attention increases the amplitude of stimulus representations in these spatial maps, particularly in higher visual areas, but does not substantively change their size."
https://openalex.org/W2111747321,"Genome sequencing of single cells has a variety of applications, including characterizing difficult-to-culture microorganisms and identifying somatic mutations in single cells from mammalian tissues. A major hurdle in this process is the bias in amplifying the genetic material from a single cell, a procedure known as polymerase cloning. Here we describe the microwell displacement amplification system (MIDAS), a massively parallel polymerase cloning method in which single cells are randomly distributed into hundreds to thousands of nanoliter wells and their genetic material is simultaneously amplified for shotgun sequencing. MIDAS reduces amplification bias because polymerase cloning occurs in physically separated, nanoliter-scale reactors, facilitating the de novo assembly of near-complete microbial genomes from single Escherichia coli cells. In addition, MIDAS allowed us to detect single-copy number changes in primary human adult neurons at 1- to 2-Mb resolution. MIDAS can potentially further the characterization of genomic diversity in many heterogeneous cell populations."

We found that functionally independent populations of neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), a region that has been implicated in feeding, sex and aggression, are essential for predator and social fear in mice. Our results establish a critical role for VMH in fear and have implications for selective intervention in pathological fear in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2057386575,"This study shows that neural progenitor cells in the adult hippocampus of mice receive immature GABAergic synaptic inputs from parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons, and uses optogenetic stimulation to demonstrate local PV interneuron activation via GABA signaling promotes survival and maturation of newborn neurons. Using immunohistology, electron microscopy, electrophysiology and optogenetics, we found that proliferating adult mouse hippocampal neural precursors received immature GABAergic synaptic inputs from parvalbumin-expressing interneurons. Recently shown to suppress adult quiescent neural stem cell activation, parvalbumin interneuron activation promoted newborn neuronal progeny survival and development. Our results suggest a niche mechanism involving parvalbumin interneurons that couples local circuit activity to the diametric regulation of two critical early phases of adult hippocampal neurogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2149137596,"In exploring the possibility that racial differences in platelet function might exist, Paul Bray and his colleagues report that platelets from blacks have a greater propensity to aggregate than those from whites in response to activation of the PAR4 thrombin receptor. Mechanistically, this difference in platelet function seems to reflect differences in the expression of the microRNA miR-376c and its target, the enzyme phosphatidylcholine transfer protein. Racial differences in the pathophysiology of atherothrombosis are poorly understood. We explored the function and transcriptome of platelets in healthy black (n = 70) and white (n = 84) subjects. Platelet aggregation and calcium mobilization induced by the PAR4 thrombin receptor were significantly greater in black subjects. Numerous differentially expressed RNAs were associated with both race and PAR4 reactivity, including PCTP (encoding phosphatidylcholine transfer protein), and platelets from black subjects expressed higher levels of PC-TP protein. PC-TP inhibition or depletion blocked PAR4- but not PAR1-mediated activation of platelets and megakaryocytic cell lines. miR-376c levels were differentially expressed by race and PAR4 reactivity and were inversely correlated with PCTP mRNA levels, PC-TP protein levels and PAR4 reactivity. miR-376c regulated the expression of PC-TP in human megakaryocytes. A disproportionately high number of microRNAs that were differentially expressed by race and PAR4 reactivity, including miR-376c, are encoded in the DLK1-DIO3 locus and were expressed at lower levels in platelets from black subjects. These results suggest that PC-TP contributes to the racial difference in PAR4-mediated platelet activation, indicate a genomic contribution to platelet function that differs by race and emphasize a need to consider the effects of race when developing anti-thrombotic drugs."

https://openalex.org/W2033462059,"Metastasis causes most deaths from colon cancer yet mechanistic understanding and therapeutic options remain limited. Here we show that expression of microRNA (miR)-192 is inversely correlated with metastatic potential of colon cancer cells. Ectopic expression of miR-192 sensitizes colon cancer cells to growth factor deprivation stress-induced apoptosis, whereas inhibition of miR-192 confers resistance. Overexpression of miR-192 inhibits metastatic colonization to the liver in an orthotopic mouse model of colon cancer. Alterations associated with the metastatic phenotype in the primary tumors include increased apoptosis, decreased proliferation and angiogenesis. Further studies indicate that miR-192 downregulates expression of Bcl-2, Zeb2 and VEGFA in vitro and in vivo, which is responsible for enhanced apoptosis, increased expression of E-cadherin and decreased angiogenesis in vivo, respectively. Finally, studies performed on human colonic adenocarcinoma show that expression of miR-192 is significantly reduced in neoplastic cells as compared with normal colonic epithelium. Importantly, there is a significant decrease in miR-192 expression in stage IV tumors when compared with stage I or II lesions. These findings indicate that miR-192 has an important role in colon cancer development and progression. Our studies underscore the clinical relevance and prognostic significance of miR-192 expression in colon cancer. Therefore, a major implication of our studies is that restoration of miR-192 expression or antagonism of its target genes (Bcl-2, Zeb2 or VEGFA) may have considerable therapeutic potential for anti-metastatic therapy in patients with colon cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1977139727,"To elucidate the mechanisms behind the high sensitivity of myxoid/round cell liposarcoma (MRCL) to trabectedin and the suggested selectivity for specific subtypes, we have developed and characterized three MRCL xenografts, namely ML017, ML015 and ML004 differing for the break point of the fusion gene FUS-CHOP, respectively of type I, II and III. FUS-CHOP binding to the promoters of some target genes such as Pentraxin 3 or Fibronectin 1, assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation, was strongly reduced in the tumor 24 h after the first or the third weekly dose of trabectedin, indicating that the drug at therapeutic doses causes a detachment of the FUS-CHOP chimera from its target promoters as previously shown in vitro. Moreover, the higher sensitivity of MRCL types I and II appears to be related to a more prolonged block of the transactivating activity of the fusion protein. Doxorubicin did not affect the binding of FUS-CHOP to target promoters. Histologically, the response to trabectedin in ML017 and ML015 was associated with a marked depletion of non-lipogenic tumoral cells and vascular component, as well as lipidic maturation as confirmed by PPARγ2 expression in western Blot. By contrast, in ML004 no major changes either in the cellularity or in the amount of mature were found, and consistently PPARγ2 was null. In conclusion, the data support the view that the selective mechanism of action of trabectedin in MRCL is specific and related to its ability to cause a functional inactivation of the oncogenic chimera with consequent derepression of the adypocytic differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2039450150,"Inhibitors of sphingolipid synthesis protect mice from diet induced-insulin resistance, and sphingolipids such as ceramides and glucosylated-ceramides (e.g., GM3) are putative nutritional intermediates linking obesity to diabetes risk. Herein we investigated the role of each of these sphingolipids in muscle and adipose tissue and conclude that they are independent and separable antagonists of insulin signaling. Of particular note, ceramides antagonize insulin signaling in both myotubes and adipocytes, whereas glucosyceramides are only efficacious in adipocytes: 1) In myotubes exposed to saturated fats, inhibitors of enzymes required for ceramide synthesis enhance insulin signaling, but those targeting glucosylceramide synthase have no effect. 2) Exogenous ceramides antagonize insulin signaling in myotubes, whereas ganglioside precursors do not. 3) Overexpression of glucosylceramide synthase in myotubes induces glucosylceramide but enhances insulin signaling. In contrast, glucosylated ceramides have profound effects in adipocytes. For example, either ganglioside addition or human glucosylceramide synthase overexpression suppresses insulin signaling in adipocytes. These data have important mechanistic implications for understanding how these sphingolipids contribute to energy sensing and the disruption of anabolism under conditions of nutrient oversupply.

https://openalex.org/W2064848205,"Jasmonates are ubiquitous oxylipin-derived phytohormones that are essential in the regulation of many development, growth and defence processes. Across the plant kingdom, jasmonates act as elicitors of the production of bioactive secondary metabolites that serve in defence against attackers. Knowledge of the conserved jasmonate perception and early signalling machineries is increasing, but the downstream mechanisms that regulate defence metabolism remain largely unknown. Here we show that, in the legume Medicago truncatula, jasmonate recruits the endoplasmic-reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) quality control system to manage the production of triterpene saponins, widespread bioactive compounds that share a biogenic origin with sterols. An ERAD-type RING membrane-anchor E3 ubiquitin ligase is co-expressed with saponin synthesis enzymes to control the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR), the rate-limiting enzyme in the supply of the ubiquitous terpene precursor isopentenyl diphosphate. Thus, unrestrained bioactive saponin accumulation is prevented and plant development and integrity secured. This control apparatus is equivalent to the ERAD system that regulates sterol synthesis in yeasts and mammals but that uses distinct E3 ubiquitin ligases, of the HMGR degradation 1 (HRD1) type, to direct destruction of HMGR. Hence, the general principles for the management of sterol and triterpene saponin biosynthesis are conserved across eukaryotes but can be controlled by divergent regulatory cues."
https://openalex.org/W2111523314,"Umami taste perception in mammals is mediated by a heteromeric complex of two G-protein-coupled receptors, T1R1 and T1R3. T1R1/T1R3 exhibits species-dependent differences in ligand specificity; human T1R1/T1R3 specifically responds to L-Glu, whereas mouse T1R1/T1R3 responds more strongly to other L-amino acids than to L-Glu. The mechanism underlying this species difference remains unknown. In this study we analyzed chimeric human-mouse receptors and point mutants of T1R1/T1R3 and identified 12 key residues that modulate amino acid recognition in the human- and mouse-type responses in the extracellular Venus flytrap domain of T1R1. Molecular modeling revealed that the residues critical for human-type acidic amino acid recognition were located at the orthosteric ligand binding site. In contrast, all of the key residues for the mouse-type broad response were located at regions outside of both the orthosteric ligand binding site and the allosteric binding site for inosine-5'-monophosphate (IMP), a known natural umami taste enhancer. Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that the newly identified key residues for the mouse-type responses modulated receptor activity in a manner distinct from that of the allosteric modulation via IMP. Analyses of multiple point mutants suggested that the combination of two distinct determinants, amino acid selectivity at the orthosteric site and receptor activity modulation at the non-orthosteric sites, may mediate the ligand specificity of T1R1/T1R3. This hypothesis was supported by the results of studies using nonhuman primate T1R1 receptors. A complex molecular mechanism involving changes in the properties of both the orthosteric and non-orthosteric sites of T1R1 underlies the determination of ligand specificity in mammalian T1R1/T1R3."
https://openalex.org/W1983469428,"For iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster synthesis in mitochondria, the sulfur is derived from the amino acid cysteine by the cysteine desulfurase activity of Nfs1. The enzyme binds the substrate cysteine in the pyridoxal phosphate-containing site, and a persulfide is formed on the active site cysteine in a manner depending on the accessory protein Isd11. The persulfide is then transferred to the scaffold Isu, where it combines with iron to form the Fe-S cluster intermediate. Frataxin is implicated in the process, although it is unclear where and how, and deficiency causes Friedreich ataxia. Using purified proteins and isolated mitochondria, we show here that the yeast frataxin homolog (Yfh1) directly and specifically stimulates cysteine binding to Nfs1 by exposing substrate-binding sites. This novel function of frataxin does not require iron, Isu1, or Isd11. Once bound to Nfs1, the substrate cysteine is the source of the Nfs1 persulfide, but this step is independent of frataxin and strictly dependent on Isd11. Recently, a point mutation in Isu1 was found to bypass many frataxin functions. The data presented here show that the Isu1 suppressor mimics the frataxin effects on Nfs1, explaining the bypassing activity. We propose a regulatory mechanism for the Nfs1 persulfide-forming activity. Specifically, at least two separate conformational changes must occur in the enzyme for optimum activity as follows: one is mediated by frataxin interaction that exposes the “buried” substrate-binding sites, and the other is mediated by Isd11 interaction that brings the bound substrate cysteine and the active site cysteine in proximity for persulfide formation.

https://openalex.org/W1985163825,"Growth of a flagellum outside the bacterial cell proceeds by successive subunit acquisition from the cell export machinery to form a chain that is pulled to the flagellum tip, where subunit crystallization provides the entropic force to drive the process. An unsolved mystery of bacterial flagella is a matter of scale: how are they built to extend far outside the cell, where there is no energy to fuel their assembly? Gillian Fraser and colleagues offer a solution to the puzzle in the form of a simple mechanism powered by the subunits themselves. Flagella are assembled from thousands of protein subunits secreted in an unfolded state by the export machinery at the base of each flagellum. Subunits then transit through a narrow channel in the flagellum to the growing tip where they fold into the nascent structure. Fraser et al. propose a mechanism for flagellum growth that is powered by the subunits as they are successively captured from the flagellum base by linkage into a subunit chain that is pulled to the tip, with the pulling force adjusting to keep subunit delivery constant. Central to this mechanism is the multisubunit structure of the protein chains that enables folding of subunits at the growing tip to be coupled with a force sufficient to pull successive subunits into and through the channel. Bacteria swim by means of long flagella extending from the cell surface. These are assembled from thousands of protein subunits translocated across the cell membrane by an export machinery at the base of each flagellum. Unfolded subunits1,2,3 then transit through a narrow channel at the core of the growing flagellum to the tip, where they crystallize into the nascent structure. As the flagellum lengthens outside the cell, the rate of flagellum growth does not change4. The mystery is how subunit transit is maintained at a constant rate without a discernible energy source in the channel of the external flagellum5. We present evidence for a simple physical mechanism for flagellum growth that harnesses the entropic force of the unfolded subunits themselves. We show that a subunit docked at the export machinery can be captured by a free subunit through head-to-tail linkage of juxtaposed amino (N)- and carboxy (C)-terminal helices. We propose that sequential rounds of linkage would generate a multisubunit chain that pulls successive subunits into and through the channel to the flagellum tip, and by isolating filaments growing on bacterial cells we reveal the predicted chain of head-to-tail linked subunits in the transit channel of flagella. Thermodynamic analysis confirms that links in the subunit chain can withstand the pulling force generated by rounds of subunit crystallization at the flagellum tip, and polymer theory predicts that as the N terminus of each unfolded subunit crystallizes, the entropic force at the subunit C terminus would increase, rapidly overcoming the threshold required to pull the next subunit from the export machinery. This pulling force would adjust automatically over the increasing length of the growing flagellum, maintaining a constant rate of subunit delivery to the tip."
https://openalex.org/W2030705564,"Tetra-cationic Zn(II) meso-tetrakis(N-alkylpyridinium-2 (or -3 or -4)-yl)porphyrins (ZnPs) with progressively increased lipophilicity were synthesized to investigate how the tri-dimensional shape and lipophilicity of the photosensitizer (PS) affect cellular uptake, subcellular distribution, and photodynamic efficacy. The effect of the tri-dimensional shape of the molecule was studied by shifting the N-alkyl substituent attached to the pyridyl nitrogen from ortho to meta and para positions. Progressive increase of lipophilicity from shorter hydrophilic (methyl) to longer amphiphilic (hexyl) alkyl chains increased the phototoxicity of the ZnP PSs. PS efficacy was also increased for all derivatives when the alkyl substituents were shifted from ortho to meta, and from meta to para positions. Both cellular uptake and subcellular distribution of the PSs were affected by the lipophilicity and the position of the alkyl chains on the periphery of the porphyrin ring. Whereas the hydrophilic ZnPs demonstrated mostly lysosomal distribution, the amphiphilic hexyl derivatives were associated with mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and plasma membrane. A comparison of hexyl isomers revealed that cellular uptake and partition into membranes followed the order para > meta > ortho. Varying the position and length of the alkyl substituents affects (i) the exposure of cationic charges for electrostatic interactions with anionic biomolecules and (ii) the lipophilicity of the molecule. The charge, lipophilicity, and the tri-dimensional shape of the PS are the major factors that determine cellular uptake, subcellular distribution, and as a consequence, the phototoxicity of the PSs."
https://openalex.org/W2021894158,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of deaths in cancer patients in the United States. Identification of new molecular targets is clearly needed to improve therapeutic outcomes of this devastating human disease. Activating mutations in K-Ras oncogene and increased expression of FOXM1 protein are associated with poor prognosis in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. Transgenic expression of activated KrasG12D in mouse respiratory epithelium is sufficient to induce lung adenocarcinomas; however, transcriptional mechanisms regulated by K-Ras during the initiation of lung cancer remain poorly understood. Foxm1 transcription factor, a downstream target of K-Ras, stimulates cellular proliferation during embryogenesis, organ repair and tumor growth, but its role in tumor initiation is unknown. In the present study, we used transgenic mice expressing KrasG12D under control of Sftpc promoter to demonstrate that Foxm1 was induced in type II epithelial cells before the formation of lung tumors. Conditional deletion of Foxm1 from KrasG12D-expressing respiratory epithelium prevented the initiation of lung tumors in vivo. The loss of Foxm1 inhibited expression of K-Ras target genes critical for the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways, including Ikbkb, Nfkb1, Nfkb2, Rela, Jnk1, N-Myc, Pttg1 and Cdkn2a. Transgenic overexpression of activated FOXM1 mutant was sufficient to induce expression of these genes in alveolar type II cells. FOXM1 directly bound to promoter regions of Ikbkb, Nfkb2, N-Myc, Pttg1 and Cdkn2a, indicating that these genes are direct FOXM1 targets. FOXM1 is required for K-Ras-mediated lung tumorigenesis by activating genes critical for the NF-κB and JNK pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1997747884,"O-GlcNAcylation is a post-translational modification that regulates a broad range of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins and is emerging as a key regulator of various biological processes. Previous studies have shown that increased levels of global O-GlcNAcylation and O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) are linked to the incidence of metastasis in breast cancer patients, but the molecular basis behind this is not fully known. In this study, we have determined that the actin-binding protein cofilin is O-GlcNAcylated by OGT and mainly, if not completely, mediates OGT modulation of cell mobility. O-GlcNAcylation at Ser-108 of cofilin is required for its proper localization in invadopodia at the leading edge of breast cancer cells during three-dimensional cell invasion. Loss of O-GlcNAcylation of cofilin leads to destabilization of invadopodia and impairs cell invasion, although the actin-severing activity or lamellipodial localization is not affected. Our study provides insights into the mechanism of post-translational modification in fine-tuning the regulation of cofilin activity and suggests its important implications in cancer metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2057098967,"The microbial degradation of the plant cell wall is an important biological process that is highly relevant to environmentally significant industries such as the bioenergy and biorefining sectors. A major component of the wall is glucuronoxylan, a β1,4-linked xylose polysaccharide that is decorated with α-linked glucuronic and/or methylglucuronic acid (GlcA/MeGlcA). Recently three members of a glycoside hydrolase family, GH115, were shown to hydrolyze MeGlcA side chains from the internal regions of xylan, an activity that has not previously been described. Here we show that a dominant member of the human microbiota, Bacteroides ovatus, contains a GH115 enzyme, BoAgu115A, which displays glucuronoxylan α-(4-O-methyl)-glucuronidase activity. The enzyme is significantly more active against substrates in which the xylose decorated with GlcA/MeGlcA is flanked by one or more xylose residues.

Gordon J.I. Human nutrition, the gut microbiome and the immune system.Nature. 2011; 474: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar for review). Plant cell walls present a highly complex substrate, and thus microorganisms that utilize these composite structures express an array of catabolic enzymes, primarily glycoside hydrolases, but also carbohydrate esterases and polysaccharide lyases, which degrade the structural polysaccharides into their component monosaccharides (see Refs. 5.Gilbert H.J.

The biochemistry and structural biology of plant cell wall deconstruction.Plant Physiol. 2010; 153: 444-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar for review). These enzymes are grouped into sequence-based families in the CAZy database (glycoside hydrolase and carbohydrate esterase families are defined as GH and CE, respectively) (7.Cantarel B.L. Coutinho P.M. Rancurel C. Bernard T. Lombard V. Henrissat B. The Carbohydrate-Active EnZymes database (CAZy). An expert resource for Glycogenomics.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: D233-D238Crossref PubMed Scopus (4125) Google Scholar). Xylan, the major matrix polysaccharide of plant cell walls, consists of β1,4-linked d-xylose residues decorated at O2 and/or O3 with l-arabinofuranose and acetyl groups, and exclusively at O2 with α-d-glucuronic acid (GlcA) or 4-O-methyl-GlcA (MeGlcA) (Fig. 1) (8.Brett C.T. Waldren K. Physiology and Biochemistry of Plant Cell Walls. Topics in Plant Functional Biology. Chapman and Hall, London1996Google Scholar). These decorated regions make the polymer backbone recalcitrant to attack by most endo-xylanases and also block the action of xylosidases. To overcome this bottleneck, the side chains are removed by specific debranching enzymes, acetyl esterases, α-l-arabinofuranosidases, and α-glucuronidases (reviewed in Refs. 5.Gilbert H.J.

The majority of α-glucuronidases that hydrolyze the GlcA and MeGlcA decorations are located in GH67 (9.Nagy T. Nurizzo D. Davies G.J. Biely P. Lakey J.H. Bolam D.N. Gilbert H.J.

These enzymes, however, do not attack glucuronoxylan, they only remove uronic acid from the non-reducing end of glucurono-xylooligosaccharides (9.Nagy T. Nurizzo D. Davies G.J. Biely P. Lakey J.H.

The structure of several GH67 enzymes show that O4 of the xylose decorated with GlcA is pointing at the surface of the enzymes, explaining why these α-glucuronidases can only target uronic acids attached to the non-reducing end of xylan chains (10.Nurizzo D.

Recently, two microbial eukaryotic enzymes from GH115 were shown to be α-glucuronidases that could cleave GlcA and MeGlcA from both the non-reducing end and internal xylose units of xylan and xylo-oligosaccharides (12.Ryabova O. Vrsanská M. Kaneko S. van Zyl W.H. Biely P. A novel family of hemicellulolytic α-glucuronidase.FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 1457-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 13.Tenkanen M. Siika-aho M. An α-glucuronidase of Schizophyllum commune acting on polymeric xylan.J. Biotechnol. 2000; 78: 149-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), displaying a single displacement acid base-assisted (inverting) mechanism, which results in inversion of the anomeric configuration of the cleaved uronic acid (14.Kolenová K. Ryabova O. Vrsanská M. Biely P. Inverting character of family GH115 α-glucuronidases.FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 4063-4068Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The two enzymes had a higher specific activity against glucurono-xylooligosaccharides compared with glucuronoxylan, although no kinetic parameters for these enzymes were reported. As no crystal structure for a GH115 enzyme is available, the structural basis for the specificity of these α-glucuronidases is unknown. To date, GH115 contains 237 members of which the majority (177) are bacterial, although only a single prokaryotic enzyme (from Streptomyces pristinaespiralis) has been shown to display α-glucuronidase activity (15.Fujimoto Z.

Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2011; 67: 68-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Bacteroidetes is a major phylum in the human gut microbiota. These organisms, exemplified by Bacteroides ovatus, are capable of degrading an extensive range of human and plant glycans (16.Martens E.C. Lowe E.C. Chiang H. Pudlo N.A. Wu M. McNulty N.P. Abbott D.W. Henrissat B. Gilbert H.J. Bolam D.N. Gordon J.I.

This glycan-degrading capacity is orchestrated by physically linked and co-regulated genes that are known as polysaccharide utilization loci (see Ref. 17.Martens E.C. Koropatkin N.M. Smith T.J. Gordon J.I. Complex glycan catabolism by the human gut microbiota. The Bacteroidetes Sus-like paradigm.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 24673-24677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar for review). The genome of B. ovatus contains seven open reading frames that are annotated as GH115s, two of which are in a polysaccharide utilization locus that is up-regulated during growth on complex xylans (16.Martens E.C. Lowe E.C. Chiang H. Pudlo N.A. Wu M. McNulty N.P. Abbott D.W. Henrissat B. Gilbert H.J. Bolam D.N. Gordon J.I.

Here we report the biochemical characterization and structure of one of these enzymes, BACOVA_03449, defined henceforth as BoAgu115A. The enzyme was shown to be a glucuronoxylan-specific α-glucuronidase that displayed a strong preference for uronic acids that decorate internal xylose units. The enzyme displays the same core-fold as GH67 α-glucuronidases, however, the active site residues are not conserved in the two enzymes. Mutagenesis and structural data indicate that a significant conformational change is required to assemble the catalytic apparatus in BoAgu115A. The open reading frame encoding mature forms (and truncated derivatives of BoAgu115A) of the seven B. ovatus GH115 proteins were amplified from genomic DNA (B. ovatus ATCC 8483) by PCR using primers that introduce NheI and XhoI restriction enzyme sites. The amplified DNA was cloned into the Escherichia coli expression vector pET28a (Novagen) such that the encoded recombinant proteins contain an N-terminal His6 tag. The recombinant proteins were produced in E. coli BL21 DE3 (Novagen) cells, harboring appropriate pET-based plasmids, and cultured in LB broth containing kanamycin (50 μg/ml) at 37 °C. Cells were grown to mid-exponential phase (A600 of 0.6), at which point isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the cultures were incubated for a further 16 h at 16 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, and His6-tagged recombinant protein was purified from cell-free extracts by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) using standard methodology (18.Hogg D. Pell G. Dupree P. Goubet F. Martín-Orúe S.M. Armand S. Gilbert H.J. The modular architecture of Cellvibrio japonicus mannanases in glycoside hydrolase families 5 and 26 points to differences in their role in mannan degradation.Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 1027-1043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For crystallographic studies BoAgu115A was further purified by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 75 column. All proteins were purified to electrophoretic homogeneity as judged by SDS-PAGE. Site-directed mutagenesis was conducted using the PCR-based QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions, using the plasmid encoding BoAgu115A as the template and appropriate primer pairs. The oligosaccharides are defined as follows: for homopolymers of β1,4-linked xylose residues either the full name of the saccharide is used or the degree of polymerization is indicated as a subscript (e.g. the tetrasaccharide of xylose is denoted as xylotetraose or X4). Glucurono-xylooligosaccharides are identified by their sequence (unless otherwise stated) in which X is an undecorated xylose and U is a xylose containing an α1,2-linked [Me]GlcA (e.g. UXXX is xylotetraose in which the xylose at the non-reducing end contains an α1,2-linked [Me]GlcA). Substrates consisted of glucurono-xylans or glucurono-xylooligosaccharides. The glucurono-xylooligosaccharides UX and UXXX were purchased from Megazyme International (County Wicklow, Ireland), whereas UXX and XUXX were made as follows: 5 g of birch wood xylan (Sigma) was digested to completion with either CjXyn10A (19.Charnock S.J.

The glucurono-xylooligosaccharides generated by CjXyn10A, UXX, or NpXyn11A, XUXX, were purified from neutral xylooligosaccharides using Dowex chromatography (9.Nagy T. Nurizzo D. Davies G.J. Biely P.

The structure of the products were confirmed by incubation with CjGlcA67A, which generated xylotriose from the CjXyn10A product but no undecorated xylooligosaccharide from the NpXyn11A product, whereas BoAgu115A released xylotriose and xylotetraose from glucurono-xylooligosaccharides generated by the GH10 and GH11 xylanases, respectively. The deduced structure of the two glucurono-xylooligosaccharides is entirely consistent with the glucuronoxylan binding mode of the two xylanases (21.Vardakou M. Dumon C. Murray J.W. Weiner D.P.

Enzyme assays, in which polysaccharides or glucurono-xylooligosaccharides were the substrates, were carried out in PC buffer at 37 °C using enzyme purified to electrophoretic homogeneity by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography. The concentration of enzyme varied from 10 nm for the wild type glucuronidase to 10 μm for the least active variants of BoAgu115A. For kinetic assays, glucuronic acid was detected using the α-d-glucuronidase assay kit in which the uronic acid released is oxidized to glucarate with the concomitant reduction of NAD+ to NADH, which was monitored continuously at 340 nm and quantified using a molar extinction coefficient of 6220 m−1 cm−1. The molar concentration of the GlcA/MeGlcA in the glucuronoxylans was quantified by digesting 100 μg of the polysaccharides to completion with BoAgu115A. To measure the activity of the BoAgu115A mutants the xylotetraose reaction product released from XUXX was monitored by high performance anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC) as described previously (18.Hogg D. Pell G. Dupree P. Goubet F. Martín-Orúe S.M. Armand S. Gilbert H.J.

J. 2003; 371: 1027-1043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction was carried out in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at a substrate concentration (1 mm) that was well below the KM. Thus, the initial rate of hydrolysis of the glucurono-xylooligosaccharides gives a direct readout of kcat/KM (19.Charnock S.J. Spurway T.D. Xie H. Beylot M.H. Virden R. Warren R.A. Hazlewood G.P.

The glucuronidase-catalyzed reactions were also subjected to Polysaccharide Analysis using Carbohydrate gel Electrophoresis (PACE) 4The abbreviation used is:PACEpolysaccharide analysis using carbohydrate gel electrophoresis. as follows: a alcohol-insoluble residue was prepared from mature Arabidopsis thaliana wild type and gux1gux2 stems as well as wild type willow, barley, sugar cane, and Miscanthus stems, as previously described (23.Mortimer J.C.

Alcohol-insoluble residue (500 μg) was pre-treated with 20 μl of 4 m NaOH for 1 h, neutralized with HCl, and ammonium acetate buffer, pH 6.0, added to a final concentration of 0.1 m and a final volume of 500 μl. The Arabidopsis alcohol-insoluble residue was digested to completion with xylanases (CjXyn10A and NpXyn11A), a glucuronoxylanase (BoGH30; Bacova_03432), and GH67 and GH115 α-glucuronidases (CjGlcA67A and BoAgu115A) as stated in the text and then dried in vacuum, whereas the other xylans were just digested with BoAgu115A. Released mono- and oligosaccharides were labeled with 8-aminonaphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid (Invitrogen) and separated by gel electrophoresis as previously described (24.Goubet F. Jackson P.

SeMet-BoAgu115A and native BoAgu115A, at 10 mg/ml, were crystallized from 19% PEG3350, 0.2 m sodium citrate, pH 5.5. For both selenomethionine and native enzyme, crystals were harvested in a solution containing the mother liquor supplemented with 15% (v/v) PEG 400 or Paratone N oil as cryoprotectant and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Native crystals were soaked with 300 mm GlcA to obtain structures of BoAgu115A in complex with the uronic acid product. Diffraction data were collected at the Diamond Light Source, Didcot, United Kingdom, on beamlines I04–1 (ligand, λ = 0.9163 Å) and I02 (native and selenomethionine, λ = 0.9795 Å) at a temperature of 100 K. Data were processed and integrated with iMosflm (25.Leslie A.G.W. Powell H.R.

For all datasets, the space groups were determined to be P212121 with two molecules in the asymmetric unit (giving a Matthews coefficient of about 2.7 Å3 Da−1 and a solvent content of about 50%). Heavy atom sites were found and initial phases were calculated using the HKL2MAP interface for the ShelxC/D/E pipeline (27.Sheldrick G.M. Experimental phasing with SHELXC/D/E.

The sample volume was 400 μl. The rate protein sedimentation was used to calculate the Mr of the glucuronidase as described previously (34.Cuskin F. Flint J.E. Gloster T.M. Morland C. Baslé A.

To explore their potential enzymatic activities, six of the seven B. ovatus GH115 proteins were expressed in E. coli in soluble form (BACOVA_00249 could not be expressed in E. coli), purified by IMAC to electrophoretic homogeneity, and their activity against glucuronoxylans was explored using PACE. The data showed that BoAgu115A released glucuronic acid (GlcA) and 4-O-methyl-GlcA (MeGlcA) from wild type Arabidopsis glucuronoxylan, but not from an Arabidopsis mutant completely lacking MeGlcA and GlcA decorations on xylan (gux1gux2) (23.Mortimer J.C.

U.S.A. 2010; 107: 17409-17414Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). The release of both GlcA and MeGlcA demonstrate that the enzyme can accommodate the 4-O-methyl substitution of GlcA, a trait shared with the other family of α-glucuronidases, GH67. The enzyme could also remove MeGlcA from glucuronoxylans present in bioenergy-relevant dicots such as willow, and from the more complex glucuronoarabinoxylans derived from monocots such as barley, sugar cane, and Miscanthus (Fig. 2B). Thus, BoAgu115A is a α-glucuronidase that targets the uronic acids that decorate xylans.

The PcG protein Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2) works as a catalytic subunit of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) by methylating lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3), a hallmark of PRC2-mediated gene repression. In skeletal muscle progenitors, EZH2 prevents an unscheduled differentiation by repressing muscle-specific gene expression and is downregulated during the course of differentiation. In rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), a pediatric soft-tissue sarcoma thought to arise from myogenic precursors, EZH2 is abnormally expressed and its downregulation in vitro leads to muscle-like differentiation of RMS cells of the embryonal variant. However, the role of EZH2 in the clinically aggressive subgroup of alveolar RMS, characterized by the expression of PAX3-FOXO1 oncoprotein, remains unknown. We show here that EZH2 depletion in these cells leads to programmed cell death. Transcriptional derepression of F-box protein 32 (FBXO32) (Atrogin1/MAFbx), a gene associated with muscle homeostasis, was evidenced in PAX3-FOXO1 RMS cells silenced for EZH2. This phenomenon was associated with reduced EZH2 occupancy and H3K27me3 levels at the FBXO32 promoter. Simultaneous knockdown of FBXO32 and EZH2 in PAX3-FOXO1 RMS cells impaired the pro-apoptotic response, whereas the overexpression of FBXO32 facilitated programmed cell death in EZH2-depleted cells. Pharmacological inhibition of EZH2 by either 3-Deazaneplanocin A or a catalytic EZH2 inhibitor mirrored the phenotypic and molecular effects of EZH2 knockdown in vitro and prevented tumor growth in vivo. Collectively, these results indicate that EZH2 is a key factor in the proliferation and survival of PAX3-FOXO1 alveolar RMS cells working, at least in part, by repressing FBXO32. They also suggest that the reducing activity of EZH2 could represent a novel adjuvant strategy to eradicate high-risk PAX3-FOXO1 alveolar RMS."
https://openalex.org/W2079870185,"The type III histone deacetylase Sirt1 has recently emerged as a critical immune regulator by suppressing T cell immunity and macrophage activation during inflammation, but its role in dendritic cells (DCs) remains unknown. Here, we show that mice with genetic Sirt1 deletion specifically in DCs are resistant to MOG-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Loss of Sirt1 functions in DCs enhances their ability to produce IL-27 and interferon β (IFN-β). Co-cultivation of Sirt1-null DCs with CD4(+) T cells inhibited Th17 differentiation, which is reversed by anti-IL27 and anti-IFN-β neutralization antibodies. Sirt1 antagonizes acetylation of IRF1, a transcription factor that drives IL-27 production. Genetic deletion of IRF1 in Sirt1-null DCs abolishes IL-27 production and suppresses Th17 differentiation. Our results show that the histone deacetylase Sirt1 programs DCs to regulate Th17 differentiation during inflammation."

Putative purine transporters of this family fall into one of two homology clusters: COG2233, represented by well studied xanthine and/or uric acid permeases, and COG2252, consisting of transporters for adenine, guanine, and/or hypoxanthine that remain unknown with respect to structure-function relationships. We analyzed the COG2252 genes of Escherichia coli K-12 with homology modeling, functional overexpression, and mutagenesis and showed that they encode high affinity permeases for the uptake of adenine (PurP and YicO) or guanine and hypoxanthine (YjcD and YgfQ). The two pairs of paralogs differ clearly in their substrate and ligand preferences. Of 25 putative inhibitors tested, PurP and YicO recognize with low micromolar affinity N6-benzoyladenine, 2,6-diaminopurine, and purine, whereas YjcD and YgfQ recognize 1-methylguanine, 8-azaguanine, 6-thioguanine, and 6-mercaptopurine and do not recognize any of the PurP ligands. Furthermore, the permeases PurP and YjcD were subjected to site-directed mutagenesis at highly conserved sites of transmembrane segments 1, 3, 8, 9, and 10, which have been studied also in COG2233 homologs. Residues irreplaceable for uptake activity or crucial for substrate selectivity were found at positions occupied by similar role amino acids in the Escherichia coli xanthine- and uric acid-transporting homologs (XanQ and UacT, respectively) and predicted to be at or around the binding site.

The external supply of purine nucleobases can be vital to cells that either rely on salvage pathways for nucleotide synthesis or use purines as nitrogen or carbon sources through catabolism. Entry of these solutes is regulated by a range of different membrane transport systems depending on the type of organism and cell.

The following NCS2 homologs were analyzed: E. coli UraA (P0AGM7), RutG (P75892), XanQ (P67444), XanP (P0AGM9), UacT (Q46821), YbbY (P77328), YjcD (P0AF52), YgfQ (Q46817), PurP (P31466), and YicO (P31440); Bacillus subtilis PyrP (YP_003865951), PucJ (O32139), PucK (O32140), PbuX (P42086), PbuG (O34987), and PbuO (O34978); Sinorhizobium meliloti SmLL9 (CAC47601), SmLL8 (CAC47602), and SmVC3 (NP_437325.1); Acinetobacter calcoaceticus AcS4X6 (WP_003654128); A. nidulans UapA (Q07307), UapC (P48777), and AzgA (Q7Z8R3); Aspergillus fumigatus AfUapA (XP748919) and AfAzgA (XP_753664.1); Candida albicans Xut1 (AAX22221.1); Arabidopsis thaliana AtAzgA1 (AEE74982) and AtAzgA2 (AED95923); Zea mays Lpe1 (NP_001150400.1); Homo sapiens hSVCT1 (Q9UHI7) and hSVCT2 (Q9UGH3); and Rattus norvegicus rSNBT1 (BAI66650). Conserved sequence motif discovery was based on the program MEME (29Bailey T.L. Boden M. Buske F.A. Frith M. Grant C.E. Clementi L. Ren J. Li W.W. Noble W.S. MEME SUITE: tools for motif discovery and searching.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: W202-W208Crossref PubMed Scopus (5945) Google Scholar). Phylogeny trees were constructed using MEGA 4.1 (30Tamura K.

Initial analysis of transmembrane topology of PurP and YjcD was performed with the program TMHMM (31Granseth E. Daley D.O. Rapp M. Melén K. von Heijne G. Experimentally constrained topology models for 51,208 bacterial inner membrane proteins.J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 352: 489-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and structural homology prediction was performed with HHpred (28Söding J. Biegert A. Lupas A.N. The HHpred interactive server for protein homology detection and structure prediction.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: W244-W248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2643) Google Scholar). Homology threading was performed using the known x-ray structure of UraA as a template (Protein Data Bank code 3QE7) on the web-based SWISS-MODEL modeling server (32Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. SWISS-MODEL: an automated protein homology-modeling server.Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4492) Google Scholar); results were displayed and analyzed with PyMOL v1.4 (Schrödinger, LLC) and VMD (33Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. VMD: visual molecular dynamics.J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14 (27–28): 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (38698) Google Scholar). The COG2252 genes ygfQ, yjcD, yicO, and purP were mobilized from the E. coli K-12 genome; transferred to transcriptional control of the lacZ promoter/operator in plasmid vector pT7-5; and induced for overexpression in E. coli host cells. Several K-12 strains were used as E. coli host in these experiments to establish optimal conditions for assaying the uptake of each purine nucleobase. At first, aerobically grown T184 was used at conditions of negligible endogenous activity of xanthine, hypoxanthine, or uric acid uptake (12Karatza P. Frillingos S. Cloning and functional characterization of two bacterial members of the NAT/NCS2 family in Escherichia coli.Mol. Membr. Biol. 2005; 22: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, T184 cells displayed a high background of adenine and guanine uptake. This may be due in part to endogenous expression of PurP, which is known to be linked with the ability of E. coli to utilize adenine as a nitrogen source (15Burton K. Transport of nucleic acid bases into Escherichia coli.J. Gen. Microbiol. 1983; 129: 3505-3513PubMed Google Scholar, 16Burton K. Adenine transport in Escherichia coli.Proc. Biol. Sci. 1994; 255: 153-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We analyzed the RNA expression profile of the endogenous NCS2 and NCS1 genes and found that aerobically grown T184 cells express both purP and yjcD transcripts, which may account for the high adenine/guanine background (data not shown). Then we tested a range of single gene knock-out strains (Keio collection) and established that JW3692 (purP knock-out) can be used as a host for adenine uptake assays and JW4025 (yjcD knock-out) can be used for guanine uptake assays, whereas other strains, including JW2850 (ΔxanQ), JW5470 (ΔuacT), JW5636 (ΔyicO), JW5467 (ΔygfQ), and JW0327 (ΔcodB), display significant background for both adenine and guanine uptake. With respect to hypoxanthine uptake, several strains were tested, including T184 (12Karatza P. Frillingos S. Cloning and functional characterization of two bacterial members of the NAT/NCS2 family in Escherichia coli.Mol. Membr. Biol. 2005; 22: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), JW4025, JW5467, and JW3692, and found to be suitable as a host, but JW3692 was preferred for direct comparisons between adenine and hypoxanthine uptake in the same cell system. Using the appropriate host strain in each case, we found that all COG2252 constructs can be expressed in the E. coli membrane at high levels and display highly significant purine uptake activities with distinct substrate profiles (Fig. 3).

To test the consequence of Kras activation in hepatocyte, we generated a hepatocyte-specific Kras(G12D) transgenic mouse strain and observed spontaneous development of HCC in these mice. Remarkably, HBV X protein (HBx) expression significantly promotes the formation and malignant progression of Kras(G12D)-driven HCC as shown with the accelerated tumor onset, the increased tumor burden and the more poorly differentiated lesions. At the cellular level, concomitant expression of Kras(G12D) and HBx results in a robust increase in hepatocellular proliferation. We reveal that the Akt, MAPK, p53 and TGF-β pathways are deregulated in the Kras(G12D)-driven HCCs. Also, the dysregulation is more pronounced in the HCCs developed in Kras(G12D) and HBx double transgenic mice. In addition, the altered expressions of β-catenin, CD44 and E-cadherin are only observed in the Kras(G12D) and HBx double transgenic mice. These results demonstrate a crucial role of Ras activation in hepatocellular carcinogenesis and the functional synergy between Kras(G12D) and HBx in HCC initiation and progression. The novel genetic mouse models that closely recapitulate the histopathologic progression and molecular alterations of human HCC may potentially facilitate the future therapeutic studies."
https://openalex.org/W2097052256,"Prior to the advent of synthetic nematocides, natural products such as seaweed were used to control nematode infestations. The nematocidal agent in seaweed is betaine, an amino acid that functions as an osmolyte and methyl donor. However, the molecular mechanisms of betaine toxicity are unknown. We identified the betaine transporter SNF-3 and the betaine receptor ACR-23 in the nematode C. elegans. Mutating snf-3 in a sensitized background caused the worms to be hypercontracted and paralyzed, presumably as a result of excess extracellular betaine. These behavioral defects were suppressed by mutations in acr-23, which encodes a ligand-gated cation channel of the cys-loop family. ACR-23 was activated by betaine and functioned in the mechanosensory neurons to maintain basal levels of locomotion. However, overactivation of the receptor by excess betaine or by the allosteric modulator monepantel resulted in hypercontraction and death of the nematode. Thus, monepantel targets a betaine signaling pathway in nematodes."
https://openalex.org/W2330484539,Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-β/δ (PPARβ/δ) inhibits skin tumorigenesis through mechanisms that may be dependent on HRAS signaling. The present study examined the hypothesis that PPARβ/δ promotes HRAS-induced senescence resulting in suppression of tumorigenesis. PPARβ/δ expression increased p-ERK and decreased p-AKT activity. Increased p-ERK activity results from the dampened HRAS-induced negative feedback response mediated in part through transcriptional upregulation of RAS guanyl-releasing protein 1 (RASGRP1) by PPARβ/δ. Decreased p-AKT activity results from repression of integrin-linked kinase (ILK) and phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDPK1) expression. Decreased p-AKT activity in turn promotes cellular senescence through upregulation of p53 and p27 expression. Both over-expression of RASGRP1 and shRNA-mediated knockdown of ILK partially restore cellular senescence in Pparβ/δ-null cells. Higher PPARβ/δ expression is also correlated with increased senescence observed in human benign neurofibromas and colon adenoma lesions in vivo. These results demonstrate that PPARβ/δ promotes senescence to inhibit tumorigenesis and provide new mechanistic insights into HRAS-induced cellular senescence.

Numerous pairings of class II α and β subunits from the wide range of haplotypes and isotypes may form, but most of these combinations, in particular those produced by isotype mixing, yielded mismatched dimers. It is unclear how selection of functional receptors is achieved. At the atomic level, it is not known which interactions of class II residues regulate selection of matched αβ heterodimers and the evolutionary origin of matched isotype mixed dimer formation. In this study we investigated assembly of isotype-mixed HLA class II α and β heterodimers. Assembly and carbohydrate maturation of various HLA-class II isotype-mixed α and β subunits was dependent on the groove binding section of the invariant chain (Ii). By mutation of polymorphic DPβ sequences, we identified two motifs, Lys-69 and GGPM-(84–87), that are engaged in Ii-dependent assembly of DPβ with DRα. We identified five members of a family of DPβ chains containing Lys-69 and GGPM 84–87, which assemble with DRα. The Lys/GGPM motif is present in the DPβ sequence of the Neanderthal genome, and this ancient sequence is related to the human allele DPB1*0401. By site-directed mutagenesis, we inspected Neanderthal amino acid residues that differ from the DPB1*0401 allele and aimed to determine whether matched heterodimers are formed by assembly of DPβ mutants with DRα. Because the *0401 allele is rare in the sub-Saharan population but frequent in the European population, it may have arisen in modern humans by admixture with Neanderthals in Europe.

Major histocompatibility class II (MHCII) molecules present antigenic peptides to T cells. In humans the majority of MHCII molecules are composed of isotype-matched α and β subunits from HLA-DR, DP, or DQ. Assembly of α and β chains, which takes place after biosynthesis in the ER, 3The abbreviations used are:ERendoplasmic reticulumaaamino acidEndo Hendoglycosidase HPNGase Fpeptide N-glycosidase FMHCIImajor histocompatibility complex class IIIiinvariant chainHLAhuman leukocyte antigencontiggroup of overlapping clone. may involve the initial formation of mixed isotype complexes (1Koch N.

Why isotype-matched assembly of MHCII subunits is more efficient than inter-isotype αβ pairing is still unclear. The primary sequence of MHCII α and β chains may endow properties that ensure isotype-specific interactions. In addition to isotypic differences, the polymorphism of the MHCII genes modifies the ability of the encoded α and β subunits to acquire the appropriate conformation (2Bikoff E.K. Germain R.N. Robertson E.J. Allelic differences affecting invariant chain dependency of MHC class II subunit assembly.Immunity. 1995; 2: 301-310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 3Lechler R.I. Sant A.J.

Immunol. 1990; 144: 329-333PubMed Google Scholar). A quality control of the assembled MHCII heterodimers in the ER precedes subsequent adaption of the polypeptides to the class II processing pathway. In 1992 Anderson and Miller (4Anderson M.S. Miller J. Invariant chain can function as a chaperone protein for class II major histocompatibility complex molecules.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 2282-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) showed that invariant chain (Ii) is a chaperone for MHCII molecules that affects the conformation of the αβ heterodimer. By transfection of class II cDNAs, it was demonstrated that some MHCII allotypes assemble independent of Ii, whereas for other α and β combinations, co-expression of Ii is required for pairing and subsequent cell surface expression (5Layet C. Germain R.N. Invariant chain promotes egress of poorly expressed, haplotype-mismatched class II major histocompatibility complex AαAβ dimers from the endoplasmic reticulum/cis-Golgi compartment.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 2346-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Intracellular transport of haplotype-mixed (α and β chains encoded on different parental chromosomes) MHCII heterodimers is promoted by associated Ii chain (5Layet C. Germain R.N. Invariant chain promotes egress of poorly expressed, haplotype-mismatched class II major histocompatibility complex AαAβ dimers from the endoplasmic reticulum/cis-Golgi compartment.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 2346-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In concert with the chaperone role of Ii, Ii gene-deficient mice showed a strongly reduced expression of MHCII on the plasma membrane of their antigen-presenting cell, and again the level of surface exposure was shaped by the MHCII haplotype (6Bikoff E.K. Huang L.Y. Episkopou V. van Meerwijk J. Germain R.N. Robertson E.J.

Med. 1993; 177: 1699-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Recent data suggest that Ii is a specialized chaperone that facilitates assembly of matched MHCII heterodimers and segregation of disfavored combinations (7Neumann J. Koch N. A novel domain on HLA-DRβ chain regulates the chaperon role of invariant chain.J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 4207-4214Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). At the atomic level, it is not entirely clear which interactions of Ii with MHCII residues regulate folding of the αβ heterodimer. endoplasmic reticulum amino acid endoglycosidase H peptide N-glycosidase F major histocompatibility complex class II invariant chain human leukocyte antigen group of overlapping clone. As intermediates of class II assembly, the various α and β subunits form macromolecular complexes in the ER (8Koch N. Zacharias M. König A. Temme S. Neumann J. Springer S. Stoichiometry of HLA Class II-invariant chain oligomers.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e17257Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Subsequent subunit assembly is a requirement for disaggregation. In principle, β subunits from any class II locus, expressed in a heterozygotic antigen-presenting cell, can interact with DRα, which is monomorphic, or with any of the two allotypes each of DPα and DQα. Because of the many combinations that are statistically possible, a random interaction of nascent α and β chains in the ER would mean that initially a substantial number of isotype-mismatched αβ pairs is formed. Dissociation of mismatched and selection of matched αβ heterodimers is required for production of functional class II peptide receptors (1Koch N. McLellan A.D. Neumann J. A revised model for invariant chain-mediated assembly of major histocompatibility complex class II assembly and isotype pairing.TiBS. 2007; 32: 532-537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In mice and humans, respectively, a combination of certain IA with IE or of DR with DP or DQ subunits to isotype-mixed heterodimers was demonstrated in transfected fibroblast cells and in EBV-transformed B cells (9Malissen B.

In addition, mice that only expressed mixed haplotype class II molecules were able to mediate selection of functional CD4+ T cells (14Silk J.D. Schoendorf D. Bartok I. Chai J.G. Gray D. Simpson E.

Structural constraints for the formation of intra- or inter-isotype pairing of MHCII heterodimers have not yet emerged. Meanwhile, sequences of several hundred DR, DQ, and DP alleles have been identified, and the structures of the corresponding heterodimers can be devised based on the published x-ray crystal structure of MHCII heterodimers (EMBL-EBI; Refs. 15Stern L.J.

Cells were lysed in 0.5% Nonidet-P40 (Nonidet P-40) (Sigma) containing 10 mm Tris buffered saline (Tris, pH 7.4). Lysates were precleared by incubation with CL4B-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Immunocomplexes were isolated using protein A-Sepharose, washed three times with 0.25% Nonidet P-40 in Tris, pH 7.4, separated by reducing SDS-PAGE, and for Western detection transferred to Immobilon P membrane (Millipore, Schwalbach, Germany).

The cells were grown to 40–60% confluence in 6-well tissue culture plates. DNA and jetPEI were diluted as recommended by the supplier (1 μg of DNA/2 μl of jetPEI), mixed, incubated for 20 min, and added to the cells. After 24 h the culture medium was removed, and fresh medium was added for another 24 h. Expression of the transfected cDNAs was examined by Western blotting of cell lysates. The PyMOL program (54DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar) (contour plots at a level of +3 kT (blue) and −3 kT (red); k, Boltzmann constant; T, Temperature, 300 °K) was used. The Neanderthal sequence reads corresponding to the DPB1* gene were obtained from the UCSC database. This library contains sequences that were obtained from the DNA of three individuals found in the Vindija cave in Croatia and termed Vi33.16, Vi33.25, Vi33.26. The genome coverage of these sequences is 54.1, 46.6, and 45.2%. Sequence reads from Vi33.16, Vi33.25, and Vi33.26 (hg19) as well as pre-aligned contigs (all-hg18, UCSC database) to the DPB1 gene were extracted and re-aligned to DPB1 (NM_002121) using CLC Workbench Version 5. A nucleotide consensus sequence from the protein-coding region was determined on the basis of the information of all three individuals. If in the first instance the pre-aligned contigs or in the second instance several sequence reads of one or more individuals covering the same region show a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), we assumed the SNP with a high probability and (manually corrected) exported the consensus sequence. On the basis of the nucleotide consensus sequence, we delineated a protein sequence that was aligned to Homo sapiens alleles DPB1*0401, 0201, 0101, and 1301 and to the chimpanzee sequence Patr-DP (Fig. 7). For assembly of a Neanderthal sequence, gaps of the Neanderthal were replaced by sequences from DPB1*0401. The sequence 15–53 from H. sapiens and the compared chimpanzee sequence shows three polymorphic residues of which Tyr-24 is only found in the chimpanzee sequence. DPB1*0401 was converted toward the delineated ancient sequence by several steps of PCR-based mutagenesis using appropriate primer pairs. To explore potential inter-isotype pairing of MHCII subunits, three combinations of α and β chains, DRαDQβ, DPαDRβ, and DRαDPβ, were expressed in the presence or absence of Ii in COS-7 cells. Subsequently, cells were lysed, and MHCII molecules were immunoprecipitated with a mAb against the V5-tagged DQβ chain, with a serum against DRβ, and with mAb against the 6D4-tagged DPβ chain. The co-isolated immunoprecipitates were SDS-PAGE-separated and immunoblotted for co-expressed α chains (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 2), or for Ii (lanes 6 and 7). The α chain was detected in β chain immunoprecipitates of all three αβ combinations. Co-isolation of α chain was independent of the presence of Ii, although Ii was found in all complexes when it was expressed, as demonstrated in lane 7. Expression of β chain and of Ii was confirmed by immunoblotting of cell lysates (lanes 3–5). The result indicates that α and β chains of different isotypes co-isolate and that these complexes contain Ii. Unassembled α or β chains (intermediates formed after biosynthesis) or aberrantly folded complexes of MHCII subunits do not usually exit the ER (30Marks M.S. Germain R.N. Bonifacino J.S. Transient aggregation of major histocompatibility complex class II chains during assembly in normal spleen cells.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10475-10481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In contrast, properly folded MHCII heterodimers are transported with Ii from the ER to a medial Golgi compartment, where the glycoproteins acquire modification of their N-linked oligosaccharides. Carbohydrate maturation of the MHCII subunits was studied in the following experiments in the Ii and class II-negative human lung fibroblast cell line IMRS. Several combinations of DR, DP, and DQ subunits were expressed in IMRS cells. Cells were lysed, and lysates were digested with Endo H or with PNGase F (PNGase F completely cleaves off the N-linked carbohydrates of both complex and of high mannose type glycans, whereas Endo H only cleaves the high mannose type), SDS-PAGE-separated, and subsequently immunoblotted for β chain (Fig. 1B). Six α and β subunit combinations are displayed in Fig. 1B. A mobility shift of the class II β chain of untreated (Fig. 1B, lane 1) compared with Endo H-treated cell lysates (Fig. 1B, lane 2) indicated cleavage of the high mannose carbohydrate. For all examined α and β combinations, the position of the Endo H-sensitive β chain was comparable to the mobility of the β chain digested with PNGase F (Fig. 1B, lane 3). An effect of Ii on carbohydrate processing had been demonstrated by transfection of DR α and β and inclusion of Ii cDNA (31Schaiff W.T. Hruska Jr., K.A. Bono C. Shuman S. Schwartz B.D. Invariant chain influences post-translational processing of HLA-DR molecules.J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 603-608PubMed Google Scholar); hence, we examined the impact of Ii on oligosaccharide maturation of the isotype-mixed α and β glycoproteins. In the presence of Ii (Fig. 1B, lanes 4–6), one of six examined combinations, namely DRA.DPB1*0401, underwent no change of mobility of DPβ (Fig. 1B, upper panel, lane 5, arrow), indicating resistance of the N-linked glycan to treatment with Endo H. This difference is due to carbohydrate processing upon delivery to the medial Golgi. The other examined αβ combinations remained Endo H-sensitive, presumably because they were retained in the ER. Expression of the polypeptides is shown by Western blotting of cell lysates (Fig. 1B, lanes 7–9). This experiment indicates export of DRA.DPB1*0401, but not other mixed isotype molecules, from the ER to the medial Golgi. We next investigated whether an isotype-matched β chain can compete with the isotype-mismatched β chain for binding to α, which could explain the dominant presence of isotype-matched αβ heterodimers in antigen-presenting cells (Fig. 1C). IMRS cells were transfected as in Fig. 1A but with addition of the isotype-matched β chain. Cells were lysed, and the isotype-mismatched β-chain was immunoprecipitated and Western-blotted for the presence of associated α chain (Fig. 1C, lanes 1 and 2). In the absence of Ii, the α chain was co-isolated with the isotypic β chain (Fig. 1C, lane 2). However, in the presence of Ii, impaired co-isolation of α subunit was apparent (Fig. 1C, lane 1). Lane 11 demonstrates that in the presence of the isotype-matched β chain, the mismatched β chain was not associated with Ii. This competition by the isotypic β chain for its matched α chain was dependent on Ii, indicating that the isotype-matched β chain displaces the mismatched β chain in the αβIi complex. These data corroborated previous studies on competition of murine IA and IE subunits in transfected cells (32Sant A.J. Germain R.N. Intracellular competition for component chains determines class II MHC cell surface phenotype.Cell. 1989; 57: 797-805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Our data show that efficient intra-isotype HLA class II pairing is facilitated by Ii. We wondered whether despite the presence of DRβ chain, a combination of DPB1*0401 with an isotype-mismatched α chain can be identified in antigen-presenting cells. For detection of DRαDPβ, we employed the mAb DA6.147, which detects DRα. The specificity of the mAb was verified by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1D). This mAb reacted to DRαDRβ (Fig. 1D, lane 1) but not to DPαDPβ (Fig. 1D, lane 3) heterodimers, which were co-expressed with Ii in COS-7 cells. Importantly, mAb DA6.147 immunoprecipitated DPB1*0401-V5, which was co-transfected with DRα and Ii (Fig. 1D, lane 5). To explore association of DPB1*0401-V5 with endogenous α chains, the MHCII-positive human melanoma cell line MelJuSo was stably transfected with V5-tagged DPB1*0401 encoding cDNA. Immunoprecipitation of cell lysates from MelJuSo-DPβV5 with mAb DA6.147 showed that DPβ-V5 was isolated (Fig. 1D, lane 7). In principle, DPαDPβ and DRαDRβ could be co-isolated if these two class II isotypes bound to the same Ii trimer, which would explain detection of DPβ-V5. However, this possibility can be ruled out as we showed recently that only one class II α chain can be detected in class II/Ii oligomers (8Koch N. Zacharias M. König A. Temme S. Neumann J. Springer S. Stoichiometry of HLA Class II-invariant chain oligomers.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e17257Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Because mAb DA6.147 does not react with DPαDPβ, this result suggests that DPβ-V5 was co-isolated with isotype-mismatched endogenous α chain, presumably with DRα. For comparison, mAb I251SB was used, which reacts with DR and cross-reacts with DP molecules (Fig. 1D, lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8). The amount of DPβ-V5 immunoprecipitated by mAb I251SB exceeded immunoisolation by mAb DA6.147, which in part can be explained by the preference of DPβ-V5 to associate with endogenous DPα rather than DRα. FACS profiles of class II stained transfected cells are shown in Fig. 1D, lower panel. To demonstrate carbohydrate maturation of DPB1*0401, which was co-isolated with DRα, we digested DA6.147 immunoprecipitates with Endo H or with PNGase F and blotted for DPB1*0401-V5 (Fig. 1E). The Endo H-treated immunoprecipitate (Fig. 1E, lane 2) shows a glycosidase resistant DPB1*0401 band (Fig. 1E, lane 2, arrow) co-migrating with the undigested immunoprecipitate (Fig. 1E, lane 1). Deglycosylated DPB1*0401-V5 runs in the SDS gel in position of immunoglobulin light chain (Fig. 1E, lane 3, L). We next examined whether DRA.DPB1*0401 heterodimers can bind peptides by inspection for SDS resistance of MHCII molecules at room temperature. To acquire a peptide-receptive conformation, MHCII heterodimers require the presence of HLA-DM (DM), which interacts with MHCII and catalyzes exchange of a fragment of Ii for endosomal peptides (33Denzin L.K. Hammond C. Cresswell P. HLA-DM interactions with intermediates in HLA-DR maturation and a role for HLA-DM in stabilizing empty HLA-DR molecules.J. Exp.

Association between HLA-DM and HLA-DR in vivo.Immunity. 1996; 4: 87-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). IMRS cells were transfected with Ii-, DM-, and DRα- and DPB1*0401-encoding cDNAs. Subsequently, cells were lysed, and lysates from transfected cells and, for comparison, lysates from MelJuSo cells, were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Fig. 2A shows non-boiled (lanes 1 and 2) and boiled (lanes 3 and 4) samples, which were Western-blotted for DRα. In non-boiled samples, two bands were apparent (Fig. 2A, lane 1), one at ∼60 kDa and one in the position of single DRα chain. The band with the lower mobility in SDS gels represents compact dimers. For comparison, peptide-loaded DR αβ heterodimers from MelJuSo cells are shown in Fig. 2A, lane 2. The αβ/peptide complexes dissociated by thermal denaturation, yielding free α chains (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 4). The result in Fig. 2A indicates that, in the presence of DM, the DRA.DPB1*0401 heterodimer was recovered as a heat-resistant band, consistent with intracellular bi"

Invasion can be mediated by the P. falciparum reticulocyte-binding homologue protein 4 (PfRh4) on the merozoite surface interacting with complement receptor type 1 (CR1, CD35) on the erythrocyte membrane. The PfRh4 attachment site lies within the three N-terminal complement control protein modules (CCPs 1–3) of CR1, which intriguingly also accommodate binding and regulatory sites for the key complement activation-specific proteolytic products, C3b and C4b. One of these regulatory activities is decay-accelerating activity. Although PfRh4 does not impact C3b/C4b binding, it does inhibit this convertase disassociating capability. Here, we have employed ELISA, co-immunoprecipitation, and surface plasmon resonance to demonstrate that CCP 1 contains all the critical residues for PfRh4 interaction. We fine mapped by homologous substitution mutagenesis the PfRh4-binding site on CCP 1 and visualized it with a solution structure of CCPs 1–3 derived by NMR and small angle x-ray scattering. We cross-validated these results by creating an artificial PfRh4-binding site through substitution of putative PfRh4-interacting residues from CCP 1 into their homologous positions within CCP 8; strikingly, this engineered binding site had an ∼30-fold higher affinity for PfRh4 than the native one in CCP 1.

https://openalex.org/W2026948241,"Class III myosins are unique members of the myosin superfamily in that they contain both a motor and kinase domain. We have found that motor activity is decreased by autophosphorylation, although little is known about the regulation of the kinase domain. We demonstrate by mass spectrometry that Thr-178 and Thr-184 in the kinase domain activation loop and two threonines in the loop 2 region of the motor domain are autophosphorylated (Thr-908 and Thr-919). The kinase activity of MYO3A 2IQ with the phosphomimic (T184E) or phosphoblock (T184A) mutations demonstrates that kinase activity is reduced 30-fold as a result of the T184A mutation, although the Thr-178 site only had a minor impact on kinase activity. Interestingly, the actin-activated ATPase activity of MYO3A 2IQ is slightly reduced as a result of the T178A and T184A mutations suggesting coupling between motor and kinase domains. Full-length GFP-tagged T184A and T184E MYO3A constructs transfected into COS7 cells do not disrupt the ability of MYO3A to localize to filopodia structures. In addition, we demonstrate that T184E MYO3A reduces filopodia elongation in the presence of espin-1, whereas T184A enhances filopodia elongation in a similar fashion to kinase-dead MYO3A. Our results suggest that as MYO3A accumulates at the tips of actin protrusions, autophosphorylation of Thr-184 enhances kinase activity resulting in phosphorylation of the MYO3A motor and reducing motor activity. The differential regulation of the kinase and motor activities allows for MYO3A to precisely self-regulate its concentration in the actin bundle-based structures of cells."

This is accompanied by a marked modification of the actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesion redistribution. Interestingly, integrins and the small Rho GTP-binding protein, which are well-characterized proteins modulating actin fibers, adhesion and migration, do not appear to be required for the pro-adhesive properties of TAT-RasGAP(317-326). In contrast, deleted in liver cancer-1, a tumor suppressor protein, the expression of which is often deregulated in cancer cells, was found to be required for TAT-RasGAP(317-326) to promote cell adherence and inhibit migration.

https://openalex.org/W2112863195,"Epithelial cell polarization involves several kinase signaling cascades that eventually divide the surface membrane into an apical and a basolateral part. One kinase, which is activated during the polarization process, is phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). In MDCK cells, the basolateral potassium channel Kv7.1 requires PI3K activity for surface-expression during the polarization process. Here, we demonstrate that Kv7.1 surface expression requires tonic PI3K activity as PI3K inhibition triggers endocytosis of these channels in polarized MDCK. Pharmacological inhibition of SGK1 gave similar results as PI3K inhibition, whereas overexpression of constitutively active SGK1 overruled it, suggesting that SGK1 is the primary downstream target of PI3K in this process. Furthermore, knockdown of the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2 overruled PI3K inhibition, whereas a Nedd4-2 interaction-deficient Kv7.1 mutant was resistant to both PI3K and SGK1 inhibition. Altogether, these data suggest that a PI3K-SGK1 pathway stabilizes Kv7.1 surface expression by inhibiting Nedd4-2-dependent endocytosis and thereby demonstrates that Nedd4-2 is a key regulator of Kv7.1 localization and turnover in epithelial cells.

The potassium channel Kv7.1 (KCNQ1, KvLQT) plays an important role in a number of tissues where it associates with the auxiliary KCNE β-subunits. In the heart, Kv7.1, together with KCNE1, forms the delayed rectifier potassium current IKs, which is an important contributor to the repolarization of the cardiac action potential (1Barhanin J.

AMP-activated protein kinase downregulates Kv7.1 cell surface expression.Traffic. 2012; 13: 143-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the subsequent recovery of Kv7.1 surface expression depends on PI3K activity (17Andersen M.N.

PI3K is an important kinase that is implicated in the control of a number of cellular processes including cell proliferation, cell survival, and epithelial cell polarization (19Gassama-Diagne A.

It has in particular received a lot of attention in relation to human cancer as the kinase is one of the most common oncogenes (reviewed in Ref. 23Samuels Y. Ericson K. Oncogenic PI3K and its role in cancer.Curr. Opin. Oncol. 2006; 18: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). PI3K is composed of a regulatory subunit and a catalytic subunit that phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate into phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate. Phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate is an important signaling molecule that binds proteins via a pleckstrin homology domain, which is found in e.g. 3-phosphoinositide-dependant-kinase 1 and the Akt kinase (also denoted protein kinase B) (24Datta K.

In polarizing MDCK cells, PI3K is activated by adherens junction assembly, resulting in Rac1-dependent changes in the actin cytoskeleton (26Nakagawa M. Fukata M. Yamaga M. Itoh N. Kaibuchi K.

In polarized MDCK cells, adherens junctions are enriched in phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate suggesting that PI3K remains tonically active at this subcellular location (28Jeanes A.

Histol. 2009; 40: 395-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Furthermore, long term inhibition of PI3K reduces MDCK cell height, suggesting that tonic PI3K activity regulates basolateral membrane formation and maintenance (19Gassama-Diagne A.

Nedd4-2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that ubiquitylates target membrane proteins such as ion channels, thereby increasing the rate of their internalization and degradation (37Abriel H. Staub O. Ubiquitylation of ion channels.Physiology. 2005; 20: 398-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 38Andersen M.N. Rasmussen H.B. AMPK: A regulator of ion channels.Commun. Integr. Biol. 2012; 5: 480-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). SGK1 and Akt can phosphorylate Nedd4-2, thus increasing the binding affinity to 14-3-3 proteins (39Bhalla V. Daidié D. Li H. Pao A.C. LaGrange L.P. Wang J. Vandewalle A. Stockand J.D. Staub O. Pearce D.

Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 3073-3084Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). For the epithelial sodium channel ENaC, it has been found that 14-3-3 protein binding to Nedd4-2 prevents Nedd4-2-mediated ubiquitylation and thereby increases surface expression levels of the channel (39Bhalla V. Daidié D. Li H. Pao A.C. LaGrange L.P. Wang J. Vandewalle A. Stockand J.D. Staub O. Pearce D.

Chem. 2005; 280: 13187-13194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Because the interaction of Nedd4-2 with both ENaC and Kv7.1 is mediated by intrinsic sequences known as PY motifs, it is possible that the interaction of Nedd4-2 with Kv7.1 is inhibited by the same phosphorylation of Nedd4-2. Overall, these observations position SGK1 and Akt as possible downstream targets of the PI3K effect upon Kv7.1 localization during the polarization process. In this study, we demonstrate that a PI3K pathway stabilizes cell surface expression of Kv7.1 channels in both polarizing and polarized cells. We find that PI3K primarily acts through SGK1 and demonstrate that SGK1 controls Kv7.1 localization by inhibiting Nedd4-2-dependent endocytosis of the channel. Intriguingly, the PY motif Kv7.1 mutant that cannot interact with Nedd4-2 displayed increased expression in the apical membrane, suggesting that Nedd4-2-dependent endocytosis is important to avoid apical trapping of the channel during polarization. Overall, our data suggest that a PI3K-SGK1 pathway promotes cell surface stabilization of Kv7.1 by inhibiting Nedd4-2-dependent endocytosis and places Nedd4-2 as a key regulator of Kv7.1 surface expression and turnover. The activators and inhibitors used in this study were as follows: 52-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-1(4H)-benzopyran-4-one hydrochloride (LY294002, Sigma-Aldrich); 2-cyclopentyl-4-(5-phenyl-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridin-3-yl-benzoic acid (GSK650394, Tocris Bioscience); N4-(7-chloro-4-quinolinyl)-N1,N1-dimethyl-1,4-pentanediamine diphosphate salt (chloroquine, Sigma-Aldrich); Akt inhibitor IV (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); and cycloheximide (Sigma-Aldrich).

The rr1 anti-E-cadherin antibody developed by Barry Gumbiner was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank developed under the auspices of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and maintained by The University of Iowa, Department of Biology (Iowa City, IA). As secondary antibodies an Alexa Fluor® 488-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:200), an Alexa Fluor® 488-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (1:200), and an Alexa Fluor® 568-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (1:800) were employed. Alexa Fluor® 647 phalloidin (1:200) was used to stain actin filaments, and DAPI (Invitrogen) was used to stain the nucleus. All Alexa Fluor®-coupled reagents were purchased from Invitrogen.

The pEGFP-N2-hKv7.1 construct was a kind gift from Professor Guiscard Seebohm. pXOOM-T7-SGK1 was subcloned from pcDNA3-T7-SGK1, which was a kind gift from Professor Oliver Staub. The T7-tagged pXOOM-SGK1-S422D mutant was obtained by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis (Pfu Turbo polymerase, Stratagene/Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) using pXOOM-T7-SGK1 as template. MDCK (strain II) cells were grown in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 10% FCS (Sigma-Aldrich; henceforth called normal calcium medium, NCM) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. MDCK cells were transfected in suspension using Lipofectamine and Plus Reagent (Invitrogen) and plated on glass coverslips (12 mm in diameter, Thermo Fischer Scientific). The monoclonal stable Kv7.1 cell lines MDCK-Kv7.1 and MDCK-Kv7.1-YA as well as the polyclonal stable cell line expressing pEGFP-N2-hKv7.1 have been described previously (18Andersen M.N. Krzystanek K. Jespersen T. Olesen S.P. Rasmussen H.B. AMP-activated protein kinase downregulates Kv7.1 cell surface expression.Traffic. 2012; 13: 143-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). MDCK cells stably expressing hKv7.1, hKv7.1-YA (and when relevant, transiently expressing the ER marker DsRed2-ER) or empty cells (negative control for Western blotting) were plated on glass coverslips or in Petri dishes (for Western blotting), and the calcium switch experiment was performed as described previously (17Andersen M.N. Olesen S.P. Rasmussen H.B. Kv7.1 surface expression is regulated by epithelial cell polarization.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2011; 300: C814-C824Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were allowed to attach to the coverslips for 1.5 h in full DMEM and then washed three times in a low calcium medium (calcium-free MEM, Spinner Modification (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 1.6 μm calcium chloride) and grown for 2 days in low calcium medium until reaching confluency. The medium was then changed to NCM, which started the polarization process, and the cells were allowed to polarize for up to 24 h. For the calcium switch inhibitor studies, NCM was added for 1 h and 45 min and then changed to NCM supplemented with either 10 μm LY294002, 10 μm Akt inhibitor IV, or 1 μm GSK650394 to inhibit PI3K, Akt, or SGK1, respectively. The polarization process was followed for up to 24 h. For inhibitor studies performed on polarized cells, a 24-h calcium switch was performed followed by a 3-h treatment with NCM supplemented with either 10 μm LY294002, 1 or 10 μm Akt inhibitor IV, or 1 μm GSK650394. Transiently or stably transfected cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Blocking and permeabilization was performed by a 30-min incubation with 0.2% fish skin gelatin in PBS supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100 (PBST). The cells were incubated for 1 h in primary antibodies diluted in PBST. Secondary antibodies were diluted in PBST and applied for 45 min. The coverslips were mounted in Prolong Gold (Invitrogen). Laser scanning confocal microscopy was performed using either the Leica TCS SP2 system equipped with argon and helium-neon lasers or the Zeiss LSM 780 confocal system. Images were acquired using a 63× water immersion objective, NA of 1.2 (Leica TCS SP2) or a 63× oil immersion objective, numerical aperture of 1.4 (Zeiss LSM 780) with a pinhole size of 1 and a pixel format of 1024 × 1024. Line averaging was used to reduce noise. For double- and triple-labeling experiments, sequential scanning was employed to allow the separation of signals from the individual channels. Total cell fluorescence and intracellular fluorescent signals were quantified using the Zen 2010 confocal software and the submembranous actin cytoskeleton to define the localization of the plasma membrane. Specifically, the exterior and interior of plasma membrane-associated Alexa Fluor® 647 phalloidin staining was used to define the regions quantified. Signals were subtracted for background fluorescence (the mean intensity of the background was obtained from an area of the nucleus as none of the proteins quantified would be expressed there.) For data analysis, signals originating from the surface membrane were obtained by subtracting the intracellular signal from the total cell fluorescent signal. The surface-associated signal was subsequently expressed as a percentage of the total cell fluorescence. n > 20 cells from three independent experiments were quantified. Data analysis was carried out using one-way analysis of variance test or t test and the Prism statistical software package. Data are presented as S.E. MDCK cells stably expressing pEGFP-N2-hKv7.1 were subjected to a 24-h calcium switch before being transferred to an imaging chamber. The medium was changed from NCM to Hanks' balanced salt solution supplemented with 10 μm LY294002, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3. The experiment was performed at 37 °C. Cells were visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy using the CSU-X1 spinning disk module on a Zeiss CellObserver (Carl Zeiss microimaging GmbH, Jena, Germany) with a 63× oil immersion objective (numerical aperture of 1.2). The first z-stack was acquired 30 min after addition of Hanks' balanced salt solution supplemented with 10 μm LY294002, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, and thereafter, z-stacks were acquired every 3 min with an exposure time of 350 ms using the AxioVision software (version 4.8). The three-dimensional reconstruction of the obtained time lapse was created by using the Imaris software (version 7.2). Data are presented as a QuickTime movie. MDCK cells stably expressing Kv7.1 or Kv7.1-YA were plated in 25 cm2 flasks and subjected to a 24-h calcium switch followed by a 3-h incubation in NCM supplemented with 40 μg/ml cycloheximide. Cells were collected and solubilized in solubilization buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma Aldrich) and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate (Sigma Aldrich), 50 μl of protease inhibitor mixture (dilution of 1:200, Sigma Aldrich), and a phosphatase inhibitor tablet (Roche Diagnostics)) for 3 h at 4 °C. The samples were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was collected. The protein concentration was determined by performing Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) according to manufacturer's instructions and calibrated to 2 μg/μl. Cell lysates were loaded in equal amounts and separated on gradient (5–15%) SDS-PAGE gels. Proteins were transferred onto a Hybond-P PVDF transfer membrane (Amersham Biosciences, 0.45 μm) in 25 mm Tris base, 200 mm glycine, 20% methanol using a mini transblot (Hercules, CA). After transfer, the membranes were incubated for 1 h in blocking buffer (PBS containing 4% lowfat milk powder or 5% bovine serum albumin).

https://openalex.org/W2079597786,"Post-translational histone methylation is a dynamic and reversible process that is involved in the spatio-temporal regulation of gene transcription and contributes to various cellular phenotypes. Methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9), which is generally a transcriptional repression mark, is demethylated by H3K9-specific demethylases, leading to transcriptional activation. However, how multiple demethylases with the same substrate specificity differ in their chromatin targeting mechanisms has not been well understood. Unlike other H3K9-specific demethylases, it has been reported that JMJD1A likely forms a homodimer, but a detailed mode of dimerization and the possible link between structure and enzymatic activity have remained unresolved. Here, we report the structure-function relationship of JMJD1A in detail. First, JMJD1A forms a homodimer through its catalytic domains, bringing the two active sites close together. Second, increasing the concentration of JMJD1A facilitates efficient production of unmethylated product from dimethyl-H3K9 and decreases the release of the monomethylated intermediate. Finally, substituting one of the two active sites with an inactive mutant results in a significant reduction of the demethylation rate without changing the affinity to the intermediate. Given this evidence, we propose a substrate channeling model for the efficient conversion of dimethylated H3K9 into the unmethylated state. Our study provides valuable information that will help in understanding the redundancy of H3K9-specific demethylases and the complementary activity of their unique structures and enzymatic properties for appropriate control of chromatin modification patterns.

Post-translational histone modification is an important component of the epigenome, and is involved in the regulation of gene transcription in the chromatin context. Histone lysine methylation is known to contribute to human diseases, such as cancer, neuropsychiatric disorders, inflammation, and metabolic disorders (1Arrowsmith C.H. Bountra C. Fish P.V. Lee K. Schapira M. Epigenetic protein families. A new frontier for drug discovery.Nat. Rev. Drug. Discov. 2012; 11: 384-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar). The methylation state of lysine residues can be mono, di, or tri. These different states provide information as part of the “histone code,” in conjunction with other modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation, for fine-tuning gene expression in response to specific signals. Methylation is reversibly regulated by S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferases, the flavin-dependent demethylases, and the Jumonji family of iron and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent demethylases (1Arrowsmith C.H.

In particular, despite the similar substrate specificity of these demethylating enzymes, the differences in their kinetic properties and chromatin targeting mechanisms have remained unresolved. JMJD1A is capable of demethylating H3K9me1 and H3K9me2 specifically, but not H3K9me3 (7Yamane K. Toumazou C. Tsukada Y. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Wong J. Zhang Y.

However, there is little information thus far about the molecular basis of its enzymatic activity. Enzymological studies can provide valuable information in elucidating the biological role of JMJD1A, and understanding the catalytic mechanism of JMJD1A compared with other H3K9-specific demethylases. In this study, we investigated the structure-activity relationship of JMJD1A in detail and demonstrated how it functions as a homodimer in the sequential removal of H3K9me2 methylation. Using quantitative data during demethylating processes from formaldehyde dehydrogenase-coupled assays, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) binding assays, and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analyses, we investigated H3K9 demethylation by JMJD1A homodimer. Based on its kinetic properties, we propose a substrate channeling mechanism by which the two active sites cooperatively demethylate two methyl groups. A plasmid encoding human JMJD1A(1–1321) was kindly provided by Dr. Mimura (17Mimura I. Nangaku M. Kanki Y. Tsutsumi S. Inoue T. Kohro T. Yamamoto S. Fujita T. Shimamura T. Suehiro J. Taguchi A.

Then these tags were inserted into pcDNA3-JMJD1A to generate pcDNA3-SF-JMJD1A and pcDNA3-Myc-HA-JMJD1A. JMJD1A was also inserted into the pcDNA4-Myc-His vector to generate pcDNA4-JMJD1A-Myc-His. pcDNA3-SF-JMJD1A (H1120Y), pcDNA3-Myc-HA-JMJD1A (H1120Y), and deletion mutants (623–717, 1058–1281, 718–889, 890–1057, Δ623–717, and Δ623–1321) were generated by PCR. The Δ890–1321 deletion mutant was generated by blunting two EcoRI sites and self-ligation. All the constructs generated through PCR were verified by sequencing. 293T cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics at 37 °C. The plasmids were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following standard procedures. For Blue Native-PAGE, Native-PAGETM Novex BisTris gels were purchased from Invitrogen, and the sample preparation and electrophoresis were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. For SDS-PAGE, samples were boiled for 5 min at 95 °C in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue. Samples were loaded onto 7% gels. For immunoblotting analysis, the gel was electroblotted to a PVDF membrane, which was blocked in 2% skim milk. Primary antibodies used were anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma), anti-HA (Roche), and anti-Myc (Santa Cruz). Secondary detection was carried out using anti-mouse (GE Healthcare) and anti-rat (Santa Cruz) antibodies. Band intensity and relative molecular weights were determined using LAS3000 ImageGauge software (Fuji-film, Japan). Forty-eight hours after being transfected with plasmids, 293T cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 25 min, and the soluble fraction was incubated with an anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) or an anti-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz) for 1 h. The immune complexes were pulled down with protein A-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) and washed three times with lysis buffer. Samples were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting. Coupled fluorescent demethylase assays were performed in a reaction buffer containing 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 50 μm Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2, 1 mm 2-oxoglutarate, 2 mm ascorbate, 500 μm NAD+, 0.025 units of formaldehyde dehydrogenase, 0.01% Tween 20, 100 nm JMJD1A, and variable concentrations of K9-methylated H3 peptide (residues 1–15). Production of NADH was monitored (excitation 355 nm/emission 460 nm) and readings were taken over 20 cycles with a cycle time of 3 min. An NADH standard curve was used to convert fluorescence to a concentration of formed product. The initial 9 min were used to calculate initial velocities, which were graphed against substrate concentration. Michaelis-Menten parameters were determined by non-linear least squares fitting using GraphPad Prism 6. All SPR experiments were carried out using a Biacore T200 system using a Series S Sensorchip SA (GE Healthcare). All sensorgrams were recorded at 10 °C using a flow rate of 30 μl/min. FLAG tag affinity purified SF-JMJD1A and SF-JMJD1A (H1120Y) were captured (∼3000 response units) on parallel channels of the chip. The dissociation constant (KD) value of the peptide-JMJD1A interaction was estimated by 5 injections for 1 min of K9-modified H3 peptides at 0.64, 1.6, 4, 10, and 25 μm in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES-KOH, 50 mm NaCl, 100 μm NiCl2, and 1 mm 2-oxoglutarate, pH 7.8. All data were corrected for nonspecific binding and buffer shifts by double subtracting binding responses collected from a blank reference cell and a buffer injection over an SF-JMJD1A or SF-JMJD1A (H1120Y) captured flow cell. For purification of JMJD1A homodimer and heterodimer by combination of wild-type and H1120Y mutant, SF-tagged and Myc-HA-tagged plasmids were cotransfected into 293T cells. Three days after transfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 3 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The cell lysates were incubated with M2 α-FLAG-agarose (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed with lysis buffer three times and eluted with 200 μg/ml of FLAG peptide. The eluted fraction was then subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-Myc antibody. The immune complexes were pulled down with protein A-Sepharose and washed three times with 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 100 mm NaCl. To measure the amount of immobilized dimer, aliquots were eluted with SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard (Fig. 4A). We quantified the amount of JMJD1A proteins with a standard curve by plotting the optical density obtained by ImageJ analysis for each BSA standard versus its amount in nanograms (Fig. 4A). In vitro demethylase assays were performed using varying amounts of the immunoprecipitated dimer in a reaction buffer containing 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 50 μm Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2, 1 mm 2-oxoglutarate, 2 mm ascorbate, and 1 μm K9-methylated H3 peptide (residues 1–15) in a final volume of 20 μl. After gentle rotation at 37 °C, we collected 5-μl supernatants at the desired time points and mixed them with 5 μl of 2.5% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to stop the reaction. The solution was desalted through a C-tip300 (AMR Inc.), mixed with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, and then analyzed with a MALDI-TOF AXIMA performance (Shimadzu). Based on fractionation of HeLa cell nuclear extracts by gel-filtration, JMJD1A likely forms a homodimer (7Yamane K. Toumazou C. Tsukada Y. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Wong J. Zhang Y. JHDM2A, a JmjC-containing H3K9 demethylase, facilitates transcription activation by androgen receptor.Cell. 2006; 125: 483-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). To test whether JMJD1A forms a homodimer, we affinity purified Strep-FLAG-tagged (SF) JMJD1A using streptactin-Sepharose, and performed Blue Native-PAGE. This technique can be used to determine the native protein masses and oligomeric states and to identify physiological protein-protein interactions (24Wittig I. Braun H.P. Schägger H. Blue native PAGE.Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 418-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar). Blue Native-PAGE analysis revealed a 300-kDa band (Fig. 1A, left), which we also observed by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 1A, right). Given that the monomer size of JMJD1A is about 150 kDa, this result indicated homodimerization of JMJD1A. Furthermore, we co-expressed SF-tagged and Myc-His-tagged JMJD1A in 293T cells to validate the interaction of these two proteins. SF-JMJD1A was co-immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody after affinity purification by streptactin-Sepharose (Fig. 1B). These data strongly suggested that JMJD1A forms a homodimer. To gain more insight into the dimer interface of JMJD1A, we prepared various deletion mutants as shown in Fig. 1E, and investigated dimer formation with immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblot analysis. To date, mutational studies indicate that a JmjC domain and a zinc finger (ZF) in JMJD1A are required for its enzymatic activity (7Yamane K. Toumazou C. Tsukada Y. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P.

Protein complex interactor analysis and differential activity of KDM3 subfamily members towards H3K9 methylation.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e60549Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). H1120 is also involved in demethylation, which is necessary for binding of Fe(II) (7Yamane K. Toumazou C. Tsukada Y. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Wong J. Zhang Y. JHDM2A, a JmjC-containing H3K9 demethylase, facilitates transcription activation by androgen receptor.Cell. 2006; 125: 483-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Deletion of the ZF or JmjC domain caused the reduction of dimerization efficiency (Fig. 1C). Conversely, when co-expressing each domain with full-length JMJD1A, both the ZF and JmjC domains interacted with full-length JMJD1A (Fig. 1D). Using mutant proteins, we finally narrowed down the interaction domain to amino acids 623–717 and 890–1321 (Fig. 1E). Furthermore, we examined whether the mode of interaction between ZF and JmjC occurs in trans, cis, or a complexed mode using deletion mutants (Fig. 1F). The results indicated that each domain in each monomer interacted with both the ZF and JmjC domains in another monomer (Fig. 1F). Thus, the binding mode of homodimerization is complexed (Fig. 1G, right), bringing the two active sites close together. To examine the relationship between homodimerization and demethylase activity, we performed a demethylation assay using K9-methylated H3 peptide substrates and analyzed the demethylation products by formaldehyde dehydrogenase counterscreen and mass spectrometry. Using a fluorescent assay that follows the formation of the demethylation byproduct formaldehyde, demethylation of di- and monomethylated H3K9 peptides was analyzed (Fig. 2A). The catalytic efficiency kcat/Km of intermediate me1 is slightly higher than substrate me2, but almost the same (Table 1). Next we used mass spectrometry to measure the extent of demethylation of the dimethylated substrate as a function of time (Fig. 2B). Surprisingly, throughout the reaction the level of the intermediate substrate H3K9me1 remained low, at most 22%. These data are most consistent with a processive mechanism. However, monomethylated intermediate is also released above the enzyme concentration. Therefore, the processivity is not obligate. SPR analysis suggested that all peptides of H3K9me2, H3K9me1, and H3K9me0 showed similar dissociation constant (KD) against JMJD1A (Fig. 3, Table 2). The KD for each peptide from JMJD1A is less than the Km, indicating that the Km reflects more than just the true affinity of the enzyme for each peptide. Taken together, these results suggested partially processive whereas having a distributive mechanism for multiple demethylations.TABLE 1Kinetic analysis of JMJD1A-mediated demethylation of peptidesSubstrateKmkcatkcat/Kmμmμm min−1min−1μm−1H3K9me195.2 ± 10.516.9 ± 0.710.178 ± 0.021H3K9me2106.1 ± 11.516.5 ± 0.710.155 ± 0.018 Open table in a new tab FIGURE 3Single-cycle kinetics data reflecting the interaction of SA-captured JMJD1A with histone peptides.

We performed a two-step purification procedure with FLAG M2-agarose and immunoprecipitation by anti-Myc antibody to obtain immobilized FLAG-tagged/Myc-tagged WT/WT and WT/Mut dimers (Fig. 4A). To rule out the possibility that the low activity of the WT/Mut heterodimer was caused by monomerization, we performed immunoblot analysis after the demethylase assay. As shown in Fig. 4B, monomer units were not observed in the supernatant of the reaction mixture. This indicated that the homodimer of JMJD1A is stable. Time-dependent demethylation was successfully observed (Fig. 4C). Fig. 4D shows that the demethylation efficiency of the H3K9me2 peptide depends on the amount of immobilized JMJD1A homodimer, as in Fig. 2B. Furthermore, rapid accumulation of the non-methylated product relative to the formation of the monomethylated intermediate was observed, even in the presence of an excess of the dimethylated substrate, as in Fig. 2B. Time-dependent demethylation was observed using WT/WT and WT/Mut dimers (Fig. 5A). Two pseudo first-order rate constants for two demethylation steps were obtained through this analysis, k1, k2, and k1′, respectively (Table 3). Notably, the relative abundance of me0 was significantly decreased in WT/Mut compared with WT/WT (Fig. 5, A and C, Table 3). So we speculated that homodimerization of JMJD1A is important for efficient two-step demethylation. Based on our hypothesis, we performed a demethylase assay using the H3K9me1 peptide as a substrate to observe the one-step reaction. As expected, the WT/Mut heterodimer showed almost the same activity as the WT/WT homodimer (Fig. 5, B and D).TABLE 3Demethylation activity of JMJD1A homodimer and heterodimerPseudo first-order rate constantsRelative abundance after 30 minme2aSubstrate.me2aSubstrate.me1aSubstrate.me2aSubstrate.me2aSubstrate.me1aSubstrate.k1, min−1k2, min−1k1′, min−1me1, %me0, %me0, %WT/WT0.1500.0890.36919.140.663.8WT/Mut0.0760.0290.27816.74.553.1a Substrate.

https://openalex.org/W2139866700,"N-glycosylation is important for the function and regulation of ion channels. We examined the role of N-glycosylation of transient receptor potential melastatin (Trpm) 4b, a membrane glycoprotein that regulates calcium influx. Trpm4b was expressed in vivo in all rat tissues examined. In each tissue, Trpm4b had a different molecular mass, between ∼129 and ∼141 kDa, but all reverted to ∼120 kDa following treatment with peptide:N-glycosidase F, consistent with N-glycosylation being the principal form of post-translational modification of Trpm4b in vivo. In six stable isogenic cell lines that express different levels of Trpm4b, two forms were found, high mannose, core-glycosylated and complex, highly glycosylated (HG), with HG-Trpm4b comprising 85% of the total Trpm4b expressed. For both forms, surface expression was directly proportional to the total Trpm4b expressed. Complex N-glycosylation doubled the percentage of Trpm4b at the surface, compared with high mannose N-glycosylation. Mutation of the single N-glycosylation consensus sequence at Asn-988 (Trpm4b-N988Q), located near the pore-forming loop between transmembrane helices 5 and 6, prevented glycosylation, but did not prevent surface expression, impair formation of functional membrane channels, or alter channel conductance. In transfection experiments, the time courses for appearance of HG-Trpm4b and Trpm4b-N988Q on the surface were similar. In experiments with cycloheximide inhibition of protein synthesis, the time course for disappearance of HG-Trpm4b from the surface was much slower than that for Trpm4b-N988Q. We conclude that N-glycosylation is not required for surface expression or channel function, but that complex N-glycosylation plays a crucial role in stabilizing surface expression of Trpm4b."
https://openalex.org/W1981670940,"Excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) are crucial for glutamate homeostasis in the mammalian central nervous system. They are not only secondary active glutamate transporters but also function as anion channels, and different EAATs vary considerably in glutamate transport rates and associated anion current amplitudes. A naturally occurring mutation, which was identified in a patient with episodic ataxia type 6 and that predicts the substitution of a highly conserved proline at position 290 by arginine (P290R), was recently shown to reduce glutamate uptake and to increase anion conduction by hEAAT1. We here used voltage clamp fluorometry to define how the homologous P259R mutation modifies the functional properties of hEAAT3. P259R inverts the voltage dependence, changes the sodium dependence, and alters the time dependence of hEAAT3 fluorescence signals. Kinetic analysis of fluorescence signals indicate that P259R decelerates a conformational change associated with sodium binding to the glutamate-free mutant transporters. This alteration in the glutamate uptake cycle accounts for the experimentally observed changes in glutamate transport and anion conduction by P259R hEAAT3. Excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) are crucial for glutamate homeostasis in the mammalian central nervous system. They are not only secondary active glutamate transporters but also function as anion channels, and different EAATs vary considerably in glutamate transport rates and associated anion current amplitudes. A naturally occurring mutation, which was identified in a patient with episodic ataxia type 6 and that predicts the substitution of a highly conserved proline at position 290 by arginine (P290R), was recently shown to reduce glutamate uptake and to increase anion conduction by hEAAT1. We here used voltage clamp fluorometry to define how the homologous P259R mutation modifies the functional properties of hEAAT3. P259R inverts the voltage dependence, changes the sodium dependence, and alters the time dependence of hEAAT3 fluorescence signals. Kinetic analysis of fluorescence signals indicate that P259R decelerates a conformational change associated with sodium binding to the glutamate-free mutant transporters. This alteration in the glutamate uptake cycle accounts for the experimentally observed changes in glutamate transport and anion conduction by P259R hEAAT3."
https://openalex.org/W2093812089,"SAG (Sensitive to Apoptosis Gene), also known as RBX2 or ROC2, is a RING protein required for the activity of Cullin–RING ligase (CRL). Our recent study showed that Sag total knockout caused embryonic lethality at E11.5–12.5 days with associated defects in vasculogenesis. Whether Sag is required for de novo vasculogenesis in embryos and angiogenesis in tumors is totally unknown. Here, we report that Sag endothelial deletion also causes embryonic lethality at E15.5 with poor vasculogenesis. Sag deletion in primary endothelial cells (ECs) or knockdown in MS-1 ECs inhibits migration, proliferation and tube formation, with p27 accumulation being responsible for the suppression of migration and proliferation. Furthermore, Sag deletion significantly inhibits angiogenesis in an in vivo Matrigel plug assay, and tumor angiogenesis and tumorigenesis in a B16F10 melanoma model. Finally, MLN4924, an investigational small molecule inhibitor of NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE) that inhibits CRL, suppresses in vitro migration, proliferation and tube formation, as well as in vivo angiogenesis and tumorigenesis. Taken together, our study, using both genetic and pharmaceutical approaches, demonstrates that Sag is essential for embryonic vasculogenesis and tumor angiogenesis, and provides the proof-of-concept evidence that targeting Sag E3 ubiquitin ligase may have clinical value for anti-angiogenesis therapy of human cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2095444894,"We analyzed a complex chromosomal translocation in a case of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) and showed that it generates the fusion gene PAX3 (paired box 3)-NCOA2 (nuclear receptor coactivator 2). To understand the role of this translocation in RMS tumorigenesis, we established two types of stable mouse myoblast C2C12 cell lines expressing PAX3-NCOA2 and PAX3-FOXO1A (forkhead box O1A), respectively. Compared with control cells, PAX3-NCOA2 cells grew faster, were more motile, were less anchorage dependent, progressed more quickly through the G1/S phase of cell cycle and showed greater transcriptional activation of the PAX3 consensus-binding site. However, PAX3-NCOA2 cells proliferated more slowly and differentiated more weakly than did PAX3-FOXO1A cells. Both PAX3-NCOA2 cells and PAX3-FOXO1A cells formed tumors in nude mice, although the PAX3-NCOA2-induced tumors grew more slowly. Our results may explain why NCOA2 rearrangement is mainly found in embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, which has a better prognosis than alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, which expresses the PAX3-FOXO1A fusion gene. These results indicate that the PAX3-NCOA2 fusion gene has a dual role in the tumorigenesis of RMS: promotion of the proliferation and inhibition of the myogenic differentiation of RMS cells."
https://openalex.org/W2005223000,"High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is a 25-kDa chromatin-associated protein that aids in transcription and DNA repair by directly binding to DNA and altering its conformation. Additionally, HMGB1 can act as an extracellular ligand. When released from dying or stressed cells, HMGB1 binds to the RAGE receptor and activates the p42/44 MAP kinase (MAPK) cascade. HMGB1 is overexpressed in many types of cancer and frequently associated with tumor stage and metastasis. This has predominantly been attributed to an autocrine function that drives MAPK pathway activity. However, by using tumor cells with activating MAPK pathway mutations, we have identified a role for HMGB1 in promoting metastasis and tumor growth that is independent of this pathway. In the absence of HMGB1, these tumor cells show defective in vitro migration as well as reduced metastasis and tumor growth in vivo despite high p42/44 phosphorylation. We found that semaphorin 3A (SEMA3A), previously shown to act as a suppressor of angiogenesis and migration, was highly increased during expression in the absence of HMGB1. SEMA3A/HMGB1 double knockdown rescued the migration defect in HMGB1 single knockdown cells. HMGB1 bound at the semaphorin 3A genomic locus, promoted hetrochromatin formation, and decreased occupancy of acetylated histones. Based on human tumor gene expression databases, HMGB1 was significantly inversely correlated with SEMA3A, suggesting that this mechanism may be more widely relevant in different cancer types."

https://openalex.org/W2032766569,"Transcription plays an important role in both HIV-1 gene expression and replication and mandates complicated but coordinated interactions between the host and virus. Our previous studies have shown that an HIV-1 Tat-interacting protein of 110 kDa, Tip110, binds to and enhances Tat function in Tat-mediated HIV-1 gene transcription and replication (Liu, Y., Li, J., Kim, B. O., Pace, B. S., and He, J. J. (2002) HIV-1 Tat protein-mediated transactivation of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat promoter is potentiated by a novel nuclear Tat-interacting protein of 110 kDa, Tip110. J. Biol. Chem. 277, 23854-23863). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms by which this takes place were not understood. In this study, we demonstrated that Tip110 bound to unphosphorylated RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) in a direct and specific manner. In addition, we detected Tip110 at the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter and found that Tip110 expression was associated with increased phosphorylation of serine 2 of the heptapeptide repeats within the RNAPII C-terminal domain and increased recruitment of positive transcription elongation factor b to the LTR promoter. Consistent with these findings, we showed that Tip110 interaction with Tat directly enhanced transcription elongation of the LTR promoter. Taken together, these findings have provided additional and mechanistic evidence to support Tip110 function in HIV-1 transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1964301764,"PI3-kinase has a crucial role in transformation mediated by the oncogenic c-Kit mutant D816V. In this study, we demonstrate that the c-Kit/D816V-mediated cell survival is dependent on an intact direct binding of PI3-kinase to c-Kit. However, mutation of this binding site had little effect on the PI3-kinase activity in the cells, suggesting that c-Kit/D816V-mediated cell survival is dependent on PI3-kinase but not its kinase activity. Furthermore, inhibition of the lipid kinase activity of PI3-kinase led only to a slight inhibition of cell survival. Knockdown of the predominant PI3-kinase isoform p110δ in c-Kit/D816V-expressing Ba/F3 cells led to reduced cell transformation both in vitro and in vivo without affecting the overall PI3-kinase activity. This suggests that p110δ has a lipid-kinase-independent role in c-Kit/D816V-mediated cell transformation. We furthermore demonstrate that p110δ is phosphorylated at residues Y524 and S1039 and that phosphorylation requires an intact binding site for PI3-kinase in c-Kit/D816V. Overexpression of p110δ carrying the Y523F and S1038A mutations significantly reduced c-Kit/D816V-mediated cell survival and proliferation. Taken together, our results demonstrate an important lipid-kinase-independent role of p110δ in c-Kit/D816V-mediated cell transformation. This furthermore suggests that p110δ could be a potential diagnostic factor and selective therapeutic target for c-Kit/D816V-expressing malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2101270227,"The homeodomain transcription factor Prrxl1/DRG11 has emerged as a crucial molecule in the establishment of the pain circuitry, in particular spinal cord targeting of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) axons and differentiation of nociceptive glutamatergic spinal cord neurons. Despite Prrxl1 importance in the establishment of the DRG-spinal nociceptive circuit, the molecular mechanisms that regulate its expression along development remain largely unknown. Here, we show that Prrxl1 transcription is regulated by three alternative promoters (named P1, P2, and P3), which control the expression of three distinct Prrxl1 5'-UTR variants, named 5'-UTR-A, 5'-UTR-B, and 5'-UTR-C. These 5'-UTR sequences confer distinct mRNA stability and translation efficiency to the Prrxl1 transcript. The most conserved promoter (P3) contains a TATA-box and displays in vivo enhancer activity in a pattern that overlaps with the zebrafish Prrxl1 homologue, drgx. Regulatory modules present in this sequence were identified and characterized, including a binding site for Phox2b. Concomitantly, we demonstrate that zebrafish Phox2b is required for the expression of drgx in the facial, glossopharyngeal, and vagal cranial ganglia."
https://openalex.org/W2090945650,"The antiapoptotic BCL-2 protein MCL-1, which opposes mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, was shown to have a crucial role in the survival of hematopoietic cells. We have previously shown that, upon loss of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling, S159 of MCL-1 is phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), earmarking MCL-1 for enhanced ubiquitylation and degradation. In this study, we introduced MCL-1wt or the phosphorylation-deficient mutant MCL-1S159A in mouse BM cells, followed by adoptive transfer to recipient mice. Mice expressing MCL-1S159A exhibited significantly elevated white blood cell and lymphocyte counts, whereas no effect was observed on the distribution of T and B lymphocyte subsets or the numbers of monocytes, red blood cells or platelets. Expression of MCL-1S159A in Eμ-Myc transgenic bone marrow significantly accelerated the onset of disease, and these mice displayed increased spleen weights compared with Eμ-Myc/MCL-1wt mice. Our data demonstrate that the absence of MCL-1 S159 phosphorylation provides a survival advantage for hematopoietic cells in vivo and facilitates oncogenesis."
