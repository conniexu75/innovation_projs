https://openalex.org/W3048596299,"There is an unmet clinical need for improved tissue and liquid biopsy tools for cancer detection. We investigated the proteomic profile of extracellular vesicles and particles (EVPs) in 426 human samples from tissue explants (TEs), plasma, and other bodily fluids. Among traditional exosome markers, CD9, HSPA8, ALIX, and HSP90AB1 represent pan-EVP markers, while ACTB, MSN, and RAP1B are novel pan-EVP markers. To confirm that EVPs are ideal diagnostic tools, we analyzed proteomes of TE- (n = 151) and plasma-derived (n = 120) EVPs. Comparison of TE EVPs identified proteins (e.g., VCAN, TNC, and THBS2) that distinguish tumors from normal tissues with 90% sensitivity/94% specificity. Machine-learning classification of plasma-derived EVP cargo, including immunoglobulins, revealed 95% sensitivity/90% specificity in detecting cancer. Finally, we defined a panel of tumor-type-specific EVP proteins in TEs and plasma, which can classify tumors of unknown primary origin. Thus, EVP proteins can serve as reliable biomarkers for cancer detection and determining cancer type."

The efficacy of checkpoint blockade immunotherapy has been shown to depend on the presence of distinct, beneficial bacteria residing in the gut of patients, but how the microbiome mediates such beneficial effects is unclear. Mager et al. found that specific bacteria produce a metabolite called inosine that enhances the effect of checkpoint blockade immunotherapy (see the Perspective by Shaikh and Sears). In mouse models, inosine, together with proinflammatory stimuli and immunotherapy, strongly enhanced the antitumor capacities of T cells in multiple tumor types, including colorectal cancer, bladder cancer, and melanoma.

Among all approaches, a messenger RNA (mRNA)-based vaccine has emerged as a rapid and versatile platform to quickly respond to this challenge. Here, we developed a lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated mRNA (mRNA-LNP) encoding the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 as a vaccine candidate (called ARCoV). Intramuscular immunization of ARCoV mRNA-LNP elicited robust neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 as well as a Th1-biased cellular response in mice and non-human primates. Two doses of ARCoV immunization in mice conferred complete protection against the challenge of a SARS-CoV-2 mouse-adapted strain. Additionally, ARCoV is manufactured as a liquid formulation and can be stored at room temperature for at least 1 week. ARCoV is currently being evaluated in phase 1 clinical trials."

Here, we used intersectional genetic strategy to ablate NPY+ noradrenergic neurons and/or adrenal chromaffin cells. Using endotoxin-induced systemic inflammation as a model, we found that electroacupuncture stimulation (ES) drives sympathetic pathways in somatotopy- and intensity-dependent manners. Low-intensity ES at hindlimb regions drives the vagal-adrenal axis, producing anti-inflammatory effects that depend on NPY+ adrenal chromaffin cells. High-intensity ES at the abdomen activates NPY+ splenic noradrenergic neurons via the spinal-sympathetic axis; these neurons engage incoherent feedforward regulatory loops via activation of distinct adrenergic receptors (ARs), and their ES-evoked activation produces either anti- or pro-inflammatory effects due to disease-state-dependent changes in AR profiles. The revelation of somatotopic organization and intensity dependency in driving distinct autonomic pathways could form a road map for optimizing stimulation parameters to improve both efficacy and safety in using acupuncture as a therapeutic modality.

The goal of this study is to investigate organizational rules on how stimulation at specific body regions drives distinct autonomic nervous pathways, with a particular focus on prevention and treatment of systemic inflammation. Inflammatory responses need to be fine-tuned when animals and humans fight with pathogens. For patients suffering sepsis, the high fatality rate is often caused by excessive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, referred to as the cytokine storm (Iskander et al., 2013Iskander K.N.

During the past 2 decades, nerve stimulation has been emerging as a potential therapeutic regimen to treat systemic inflammation (Pavlov and Tracey, 2017Pavlov V.A. Tracey K.J.

It began with the discovery that electric stimulation of cervical vagal efferents could suppress systemic inflammation (Borovikova et al., 2000Borovikova L.V. Ivanova S. Zhang M. Yang H. Botchkina G.I. Watkins L.R. Wang H. Abumrad N. Eaton J.W. Tracey K.J. Vagus nerve stimulation attenuates the systemic inflammatory response to endotoxin.Nature. 2000; 405: 458-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (2633) Google Scholar). This pathway involves with activation of splenic sympathetic neurons (Pavlov and Tracey, 2017Pavlov V.A. Tracey K.J. Neural regulation of immunity: molecular mechanisms and clinical translation.Nat.

Farmer D.G.S. Brooks V.L. McKinley M.J. McAllen R.M. Martelli D. Vagal afferent activation suppresses systemic inflammation via the splanchnic anti-inflammatory pathway.Brain Behav.

As vagal nerve stimulation involves invasive surgical procedure, alternative methods, such as the use of electroacupuncture to drive somatosensory-autonomic pathways, are being explored. Acupuncture stimulation is an ancient practice to treat human diseases. One core idea is that stimulation at specific somatic tissues (acupoints) can long distantly modulate internal organ physiology. The primitive meridian channel theory is formulated to make such somato-internal organ connections. Although modern anatomical studies fail to support the physical presence of such “channels” (Longhurst, 2010Longhurst J.C. Defining meridians: a modern basis of understanding.J. Acupunct. Meridian Stud. 2010; 3: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), somatosensory autonomic pathways could exactly serve this role. In the 1950s, electric stimulation of somatic nerves was shown to be capable of activating sympathetic pathways (Sell et al., 1958Sell R. Erdelyi A. Schaefer H. [Effect of peripheral nerve stimulation on sympathetic activity].Pflugers Arch. Gesamte Physiol. Menschen Tiere. 1958; 267: 566-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Since the 1970s, pinch or electroacupuncture stimulation at abdominal and hindlimb regions was reported to differentially drive sympathetic versus vagal efferent pathways associated with gastric motility control (Li et al., 2007Li Y.Q.

Neural mechanisms of autonomic responses elicited by somatic sensory stimulation.Neurosci. Behav. Physiol. 1997; 27: 610-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Inspired by the discovery of cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathways, several studies show that limb area acupoint stimulation can suppress systemic inflammation, mainly or partly via activation of vagal efferents (Gu et al., 2011Gu G. Zhang Z. Wang G. Han F. Han L. Wang K. Liu J. Li W. Effects of electroacupuncture pretreatment on inflammatory response and acute kidney injury in endotoxaemic rats.J. Int. Med.

Med. 2014; 20: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Despite this progress, many challenges and knowledge gaps remain in studying somatosensory autonomic pathways. First, sympathetic neurons are molecularly and functionally heterogeneous (Furlan et al., 2016Furlan A. La Manno G. Lübke M. Häring M. Abdo H. Hochgerner H. Kupari J. Usoskin D. Airaksinen M.S. Oliver G. et al.Visceral motor neuron diversity delineates a cellular basis for nipple- and pilo-erection muscle control.Nat. Neurosci. 2016; 19: 1331-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar; Jänig and Häbler, 2000Jänig W. Häbler H.J. Specificity in the organization of the autonomic nervous system: a basis for precise neural regulation of homeostatic and protective body functions.Prog. Brain Res. 2000; 122: 351-367Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, we still lack tools to manipulate sympathetic neuron subtypes. Second, somatosensory neurons themselves are heterogeneous. For example, sensory axons are of distinct diameters and myelination degrees, two features inversely correlated with activation thresholds in response to electric stimulation (Parker et al., 2018Parker J.L. Shariati N.H. Karantonis D.M. Electrically evoked compound action potential recording in peripheral nerves.Bioelectron. Med. (Lond.). 2018; 1: 71-83Crossref Google Scholar). It remains unclear whether different electric intensities could drive distinct somato-autonomic pathways. Nor is it known whether there is somatotopic organization in driving autonomic pathways associated with inflammation control. Third, noradrenaline released from sympathetic nerves can suppress or promote the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines via activation of distinct adrenergic receptors (Huang et al., 2012Huang J.L. Zhang Y.L. Wang C.C. Zhou J.R. Ma Q. Wang X. Shen X.H. Jiang C.L.

As such, it remains to be determined whether electroacupuncture stimulation (ES)-activated noradrenergic sympathetic neurons could produce anti- or pro-inflammatory effects if different disease states cause a change in adrenergic receptor (AR) profiles, addressing of which is warranted because it touches both efficacy and safety issues of acupuncture practice. In this study, we developed an intersectional genetic strategy to manipulate sympathetic cells expressing neuropeptide Y (NPY) in sympathetic ganglia and/or adrenal glands. Using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxemia as a model, we then demonstrated that ES can activate distinct sympathetic pathways and modulate systemic inflammation in somatotopy-, stimulation-intensity-, and disease-state-dependent manners. To selectively manipulate peripheral NPY-expressing sympathetic cells, we developed an intersectional genetic strategy (Figure S1A), analogous to the one we used to map spinal circuits (Bourane et al., 2015Bourane S. Grossmann K.S. Britz O. Dalet A. Del Barrio M.G. Stam F.J. Garcia-Campmany L. Koch S. Goulding M.

Ren X. et al.Identification of spinal circuits transmitting and gating mechanical pain.Cell. 2014; 159: 1417-1432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). We first labeled these neurons by the expression of the fluorescent tdTomato protein, involving three mouse lines (Figure S1A). One is the Rosa26LSL-FSF-tdTomato (Ai65) intersectional reporter line, in which activation of tdTomato expression requires removal of two stop cassettes by Cre and Flpo recombinases. The other two lines are NPY-Cre (Gerfen et al., 2013Gerfen C.R. Paletzki R. Heintz N. GENSAT BAC cre-recombinase driver lines to study the functional organization of cerebral cortical and basal ganglia circuits.Neuron. 2013; 80: 1368-1383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) and DBH-p2a-Flpo (Sun and Ray, 2016Sun J.J. Ray R. Generation of two noradrenergic-specific dopamine-beta-hydroxylase-FLPo knock-in mice using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeting in embryonic stem cells.PLoS ONE. 2016; 11: e0159474PubMed Google Scholar), in which Cre and Flpo are driven from the loci encoding NPY and DBH (dopamine beta-hydroxylase), respectively, with DBH being a marker for noradrenergic neurons. In resulted triple heterozygous mice, referred to as NPYDBH-tdTomato, tdTomato expression was restricted to NPYDBH cells defined by coexpression of Cre and Flpo (Figure S1A). Two sets of sympathetic cells have been implicated in systemic inflammation control: splenic noradrenergic neurons located mainly in suprarenal ganglia and chromaffin cells in adrenal glands (Bratton et al., 2012Bratton B.O. Martelli D. McKinley M.J. Trevaks D. Anderson C.R. McAllen R.M. Neural regulation of inflammation: no neural connection from the vagus to splenic sympathetic neurons.Exp. Physiol. 2012; 97: 1180-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar; Torres-Rosas et al., 2014Torres-Rosas R. Yehia G. Peña G. Mishra P. del Rocio Thompson-Bonilla M.

Med. 2014; 20: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In suprarenal ganglia, 94.9% of NPY mRNA+ neurons coexpressed tdTomato and 98.1% of tdTomato+ cells coexpressed NPY (Figure 1A), indicating that NPYDBH faithfully marks NPY-expressing neurons. Double staining showed that tdTomato was detected in 83.3% of DBH mRNA+ noradrenergic neurons in suprarenal ganglia (Figure 1B) and 79.8% of TH+ (tyrosine hydroxylase) chromaffin cells in adrenal glands (Figure 1B). In paravertebral sympathetic chain ganglia, NPY expression is confined to two of five noradrenergic neuron subtypes (Furlan et al., 2016Furlan A. La Manno G. Lübke M. Häring M. Abdo H. Hochgerner H. Kupari J. Usoskin D. Airaksinen M.S. Oliver G. et al.Visceral motor neuron diversity delineates a cellular basis for nipple- and pilo-erection muscle control.Nat. Neurosci. 2016; 19: 1331-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar); consistently, tdTomato was expressed in ~50% of DBH mRNA+ neurons and none of cholinergic cells in these ganglia (Figure 1C). Importantly, tdTomato+ cell bodies were not detected in dorsal root ganglia (DRG), nodose ganglia, and the colon, indicating that NPYDBH does not mark somatosensory, visceral sensory, or enteric neurons (Figure S1B). Furthermore, cell sorting analyses did not detect tdTomato signal in immune cells (Figure S1C). Within the central nervous system, NPYDBH additionally labels A1/C1 catecholaminergic neurons in the hindbrain (Figures S1D and S1E), and we had a strategy to overcome this limitation (see below; Figure 2).Figure 2Intersectional Ablation of Peripheral and Adrenal NPYDBH CellsShow full caption(A) Intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) of PEGyDT to create NPYDBH (peri.)-Abl (“(peri.)-Abl”) mice.

As described below, we used the modulation of LPS-induced systemic inflammation (Remick et al., 2000Remick D.G. Newcomb D.E. Bolgos G.L. Call D.R. Comparison of the mortality and inflammatory response of two models of sepsis: lipopolysaccharide vs. cecal ligation and puncture.Shock. 2000; 13: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) to assess autonomic pathways. LPS activates the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) complex in immune cells (Salomão et al., 2008Salomão R. Martins P.S. Brunialti M.K. Fernandes Mda.L. Martos L.S. Mendes M.E. Gomes N.E. Rigato O.

We accordingly examined splenic innervations. Structurally, spleen is divided into white pulps, which are enriched with T cells and B cells, as well as marginal zones plus red pulps, where various macrophage subtypes are enriched (Figure 1D; Borges da Silva et al., 2015Borges da Silva H. Fonseca R. Pereira R.M. Cassado Ados.A. Álvarez J.M. D’Império Lima M.R. Splenic macrophage subsets and their function during blood-borne infections.Front. Immunol. 2015; 6: 480Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar; Bronte and Pittet, 2013Bronte V. Pittet M.J. The spleen in local and systemic regulation of immunity.Immunity. 2013; 39: 806-818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). In NPYDBH-tdTomato reporter mice, tdTomato+ sympathetic fibers are enriched in white pulps and trabecula structures but rarely in red pulps (Figure 1E). They are co-localized with a major subset of TH+ sympathetic fibers (Figure 1F), a finding confirmed by retrograde labeling (see below). Thus, NPYDBH-marked sympathetic cells account for a major subset of adrenal chromaffin cells and splenic noradrenergic neurons. To ablate peripheral NPYDBH sympathetic cells, we created NPYDBH-DTR mice, in which the expression of human diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) was confined to NPYDBH cells defined by coexpression of NPY-Cre and DBH-p2A-Flpo (Figure S2A). Meanwhile, all NPY-Cre-expressing cells were labeled with tdTomato to monitor selective ablation of sympathetic cells (Figures 2A and S2A). To avoid ablation of NPYDBH-marked hindbrain neurons, we injected a modified form of diphtheria toxin (PEGyDT) that does not cross the blood-brain barrier (Pereira et al., 2017Pereira M.M. Mahú I. Seixas E. Martinéz-Sánchez N. Kubasova N. Pirzgalska R.M. Cohen P. Dietrich M.O. López M. Bernardes G.J. Domingos A.I. A brain-sparing diphtheria toxin for chemical genetic ablation of peripheral cell lineages.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 14967Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). 1 month after PEGyDT injections, 96% of tdTomato+ cells in suprarenal ganglia and adrenal glands were ablated (Figure 2B). Consistently, most splenic TH+ fibers were eliminated in NPYDBH (peri.)-ablated mice (Figure S2B). Importantly, no ablation was observed in the spinal cord or the brain, including TH+ neurons in hindbrain A1/C1 areas (Figure S2C). We referred these mice with selective ablation of NPYDBH-marked peripheral noradrenergic neurons plus adrenal chromaffin cells to as NPYDBH (peri.)-Abl. Meanwhile, we created mice with selective ablation of NPYDBH adrenal chromaffin cells via bilateral intra-adrenal injections of low-dose PEGyDT (Figure 2C). 4 weeks later, 97% of tdTomato+ adrenal chromaffin cells were ablated (Figure 2D), without ablating adjacent suprarenal ganglia (Figure 2D). These mice were referred to as NPYDBH (adrenal)-Abl mice. These two sets of ablation mice, plus control littermates that received the same PEGyDT injections, were subsequently used to study the roles of various NPYDBH cells in controlling systemic inflammation. We adopted LPS-induced endotoxemia as a model to study systemic inflammation (Remick et al., 2000Remick D.G. Newcomb D.E. Bolgos G.L. Call D.R. Comparison of the mortality and inflammatory response of two models of sepsis: lipopolysaccharide vs. cecal ligation and puncture.Shock. 2000; 13: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). For wild-type C57BL6/J mice, LPS injection caused a marked increase in serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6, and this cytokine storm led to a lethality rate at ~80% (Figure S3). Before conducting electroacupuncture studies, we first examined whether ablation of NPYDBH sympathetic cells impacted on baseline inflammation and/or LPS-induced systemic inflammation. Without LPS injection, serum or splenic TNF-α levels were barely detectable in both NPYDBH (peri.)-Abl and control mice (Figures 3A and 3B ), and there were no changes of splenic immune cell profiles (Figure S2D). Thus, within the 1-month period following PEGyDT injection, no spontaneous systemic inflammation developed. However, following LPS injection, NPYDBH (peri.)-Abl mice did show an increase in TNF-α and IL-6, both in serum and in splenic tissues compared with wild-type littermates (Figures 3A, 3B, S4A, and S4B). To investigate how NPYDBH cell ablation led to exaggerated systemic inflammation, we performed a series of immunostaining in splenic tissues. Without LPS treatment, TNF-α signals were rarely detected but greatly elevated 1 h after LPS injection (Figure 3C), as reported previously (Rosas-Ballina et al., 2008Rosas-Ballina M. Ochani M. Parrish W.R. Ochani K. Harris Y.T. Huston J.M. Chavan S. Tracey K.J. Splenic nerve is required for cholinergic antiinflammatory pathway control of TNF in endotoxemia.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 11008-11013Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Double immunostaining with macrophage subtype markers (Borges da Silva et al., 2015Borges da Silva H. Fonseca R. Pereira R.M.

The spleen in local and systemic regulation of immunity.Immunity. 2013; 39: 806-818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) showed that, in LPS-treated, wild-type littermates, TNF-α was detected in 45.6% ± 2.6% of F4/80+ macrophages in red pulps, 12.9% ± 0.9% of CD169+ metallophilic macrophages in marginal zones (Figure 3D), and 3.5% ± 0.8% of CD68+;F4/80− macrophages in white pulps (Figure 3D). In LPS-treated NPYDBH (peri.)-Abl mice, the percentages become 50.3% ± 1.6%, 36.2% ± 1.5%, and 38.0% ± 6.2%, respectively, with significant increase found in both marginal zones and white pulps compared with control littermates (Figure 3D). TNF-α was also detected in some non-macrophage cells, but their identities remain unknown, as no TNF-α expression was detected in T cells, B cells, or dendritic cells (Figures S4C and S4D). In contrast with expanded TNF-α and IL-6 expression in NPYDBH (peri.)-Abl mice, no such expansion was observed in NPYDBH (adrenal)-Abl mice, in which NPYDBH adrenal chromaffin cells were selectively ablated (Figures S4E–S4G). Thus, in response to LPS exposure, tonic or LPS-induced activation of NPYDBH noradrenergic neurons located in sympathetic ganglia, which were preserved in NPYDBH (adrenal)-Abl mice but eliminated in NPYDBH (peri.)-Abl mice, produced anti-inflammatory effects and sufficiently suppressed TNF-α production in macrophages located in marginal zones and white pulps, under the LPS dose used in this study. We next assessed how LPS-induced inflammation was modulated by ES at the abdominal ST25 acupoint (Figure 4A); this acupoint was chosen based on reported splenic nerve activation evoked by painful pinch stimulation via both segmental and supraspinal pathways (Sato, 1997Sato A. Neural mechanisms of autonomic responses elicited by somatic sensory stimulation.Neurosci. Behav. Physiol. 1997; 27: 610-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). ES was performed for 15 min, followed by LPS injection. This stimulation mode was referred to as preST25 ES. Electrode insertion at ST25 without current stimulation (0 mA) was used as sham control. We first tested the responses to different ES intensities and found that serum TNF-α was reduced by 38.5% with 1.0 mA ES and by 71.5% with 3.0 mA ES, whereas 0.5 mA ES did not produce a significant reduction, in comparison with sham ES (Figure 4B). 3.0 mA ES additionally caused a reduction of IL-6 and IL-1β levels (Figure S5A) and was accordingly chosen for subsequent studies. We next explored how ES modulated systemic information, by focusing on the driving of somatosensory autonomic pathways. 3.0-mA ES at ST25 was able to activate primary sensory neurons in thoracic DRG (Figure S5B) and relay neurons in the spinal cord (Figure S5C), indicating the activation of the somatosensory system. Before assessing sympathetic pathways (see below), we first investigated vagal efferent pathways. Anatomically, there are spinal ascending projections to the nucleus of solitary tract (NTS) in the medulla oblongata (Lima, 2008Lima D. Ascending pathways: anatomy and physiology.in: Masland R.H.

I randomly assigned Iraqi Christians displaced by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) to an all-Christian soccer team or to a team mixed with Muslims. The intervention improved behaviors toward Muslim peers: Christians with Muslim teammates were more likely to vote for a Muslim (not on their team) to receive a sportsmanship award, register for a mixed team next season, and train with Muslims 6 months after the intervention. The intervention did not substantially affect behaviors in other social contexts, such as patronizing a restaurant in Muslim-dominated Mosul or attending a mixed social event, nor did it yield consistent effects on intergroup attitudes. Although contact can build tolerant behaviors toward peers within an intervention, building broader social cohesion outside of it is more challenging."

We examined and manipulated mitochondrial dynamics during mouse and human cortical neurogenesis. We reveal that shortly after cortical stem cells have divided, daughter cells destined to self-renew undergo mitochondrial fusion, whereas those that retain high levels of mitochondria fission become neurons. Increased mitochondria fission promotes neuronal fate, whereas induction of mitochondria fusion after mitosis redirects daughter cells toward self-renewal. This occurs during a restricted time window that is doubled in human cells, in line with their increased self-renewal capacity. Our data reveal a postmitotic period of fate plasticity in which mitochondrial dynamics are linked with cell fate."

This study aimed to evaluate the risk perception of COVID-19 among college students in China during the quarantine, explore its related factors, and provide reference for future study. Methods This study invited college students from various provinces of China to participate in the survey through the Internet, and a total of 1,461 college students were included. T-test and analysis of variance were used to explore the relationship between demographic characteristics, social pressure, knowledge and risk perception. Multiple linear regression was used to identify factors associated with risk perception. Results This study shows that college students in China have high risk perception of COVID-19. Female college students (p<0.01), non-medical students (p<0.01), college students whose schools are located in Hubei (p = 0.01) and college students with higher knowledge level (p<0.01) have higher risk perception. Conclusion Due to the strong infectivity and occult nature of COVID-19, it is necessary to improve the risk perception of college students through health education in various ways, and attention should be paid to some college students with low risk perception."
https://openalex.org/W3049366176,"The appearance of DNA in the cytosol is perceived as a danger signal that stimulates potent immune responses through cyclic guanosine monophosphate–adenosine monophosphate synthase (cGAS). How cells regulate the activity of cGAS toward self-DNA and guard against potentially damaging autoinflammatory responses is a fundamental biological question. Here, we identify barrier-to-autointegration factor 1 (BAF) as a natural opponent of cGAS activity on genomic self-DNA. We show that BAF dynamically outcompetes cGAS for DNA binding, hence prohibiting the formation of DNA-cGAS complexes that are essential for enzymatic activity. Upon acute loss of nuclear membrane integrity, BAF is necessary to restrict cGAS activity on exposed DNA. Our observations reveal a safeguard mechanism, distinct from physical separation, by which cells protect themselves against aberrant immune responses toward genomic DNA."

Here, we construct a robust qubit embedded in a decoherence-protected subspace, obtained by hybridizing an applied microwave drive with the ground-state electron spin of a silicon carbide divacancy defect. The qubit is protected from magnetic, electric, and temperature fluctuations, which account for nearly all relevant decoherence channels in the solid state. This culminates in an increase of the qubit's inhomogeneous dephasing time by over four orders of magnitude (to > 22 milliseconds), while its Hahn-echo coherence time approaches 64 milliseconds. Requiring few key platform-independent components, this result suggests that substantial coherence improvements can be achieved in a wide selection of quantum architectures."

Cathodic reduction at the cobaltocenium redox mediator substantially weakens the homolytic nitrogen-hydrogen bond strength of a Brønsted acidic anilinium tethered to one of the cyclopentadienyl rings.

Because long-term serum antibody levels are maintained by bone marrow plasma cells (BMPCs), we investigated the production and maintenance of these cells after influenza vaccination. We found increased numbers of influenza-specific BMPCs 4 weeks after immunization with the seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine, but numbers returned to near their prevaccination levels after 1 year. This decline was driven by the loss of BMPCs induced by the vaccine, whereas preexisting BMPCs were maintained. Our results suggest that most BMPCs generated by influenza vaccination in adults are short-lived. Designing strategies to enhance their persistence will be a key challenge for the next generation of influenza vaccines."

The structures and binding thermodynamics demonstrate that upon binding to CD20, type II mAbs form terminal complexes that preclude recruitment of additional mAbs and complement components, whereas type I complexes act as molecular seeds to increase mAb local concentration for efficient complement activation.

In the absence of COP1, c/EBPβ accumulates rapidly and drives a potent pro-inflammatory and neurodegeneration-related gene program, evidenced by increased neurotoxicity in microglia-neuronal co-cultures. Antibody blocking studies reveal that neurotoxicity is almost entirely attributable to complement. Remarkably, loss of a single allele of Cebpb prevented the pro-inflammatory phenotype.

Microglia are the tissue resident macrophages of the central nervous system (CNS), accounting for 5%–20% of all glial cells in the mammalian adult brain. In mice, microglia arise from erythro-myeloid precursors in the embryonic yolk sac and populate the embryonic brain (Ginhoux et al., 2010Ginhoux F. Greter M. Leboeuf M. Nandi S. See P. Gokhan S. Mehler M.F. Conway S.J. Ng L.G.

Unlike monocytes, which differentiate from bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells throughout life, microglia persist in the healthy adult brain via self-renewal without replacement from circulating blood progenitors (Ajami et al., 2007Ajami B.

Developing in close proximity to neurons and other glial cells from early embryonic stages, microglia play a pivotal role in CNS development and homeostasis (Casano and Peri, 2015Casano A.M. Peri F.

The interplay between neurons and innate immune cells in the adult CNS is linked to the process of aging as well as neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (Malm et al., 2015Malm T.M. Jay T.R. Landreth G.E. The evolving biology of microglia in Alzheimer’s disease.Neurotherapeutics. 2015; 12: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Indeed, the vast majority of genes that are common risk factors for AD progression are expressed either specifically in microglia, or at much higher levels in microglia than in other cells in the brain (Hansen et al., 2018Hansen D.V.

Moreover, microgliosis, which involves increased numbers of microglia as well as morphological and transcriptional changes in microglia, is a common histological feature of neurological disorders. Chronic neuro-inflammation mediated by astrocytes and microglia is one of the pathological hallmarks of AD. These observations provide a compelling incentive to understand the mechanisms controlling programs of microglial gene expression and their modification during disease. The CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (c/EBP) family of transcription factors is implicated in inflammation observed in neurodegenerative diseases and brain injury (Ejarque-Ortiz et al., 2007Ejarque-Ortiz A. Medina M.G. Tusell J.M. Pérez-González A.P. Serratosa J. Saura J.

Neuroinflammation. 2011; 8: 156Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These transcription factors regulate genes critical for activation of microglia, and they have binding sites in the promoter and enhancer regions of numerous cytokines and other pro-inflammatory genes (Fonseca et al., 2016Fonseca G.J. Seidman J.S. Glass C.K. Genome-Wide Approaches to Defining Macrophage Identity and Function.Microbiol.

Its protein levels are elevated in brains from AD patients compared to healthy controls (Strohmeyer et al., 2014Strohmeyer R. Shelton J. Lougheed C. Breitkopf T.

Johnson P.F. et al.C/EBPβ regulates delta-secretase expression and mediates pathogenesis in mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In addition, Cebpb transcript (encoding c/EBPβ) is more abundant in brains of aged AD mouse models than in brains of aged control mice (Srinivasan et al., 2016Srinivasan K. Friedman B.A. Larson J.L. Lauffer B.E. Goldstein L.D. Appling L.L. Borneo J. Poon C. Ho T. Cai F. et al.Untangling the brain’s neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative transcriptional responses.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 11295Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Expression of c/EBPβ in microglia appears to contribute to neurotoxicity because wild-type microglia activated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induce the death of co-cultured neurons, whereas microglia lacking c/EBPβ do not (Straccia et al., 2011Straccia M. Gresa-Arribas N. Dentesano G. Ejarque-Ortiz A. Tusell J.M. Serratosa J. Solà C. Saura J. Pro-inflammatory gene expression and neurotoxic effects of activated microglia are attenuated by absence of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β.J. Neuroinflammation. 2011; 8: 156Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Precisely how LPS-activated wild-type microglia trigger the death of surrounding neurons is unclear. Consistent with an important role for c/EBPβ in driving pathology, attenuating Cebpb gene expression reverses AD-like pathologies and cognitive impairments in older transgenic mice overexpressing tau (Wang et al., 2018Wang Z.H. Gong K. Liu X. Zhang Z. Sun X. Wei Z.Z. Yu S.P. Manfredsson F.P. Sandoval I.M. Johnson P.F. et al.C/EBPβ regulates delta-secretase expression and mediates pathogenesis in mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Beyond AD, c/EBPβ also promotes pathogenesis in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in the mouse (Pulido-Salgado et al., 2017Pulido-Salgado M. Vidal-Taboada J.M. Garcia Diaz-Barriga G. Serratosa J. Valente T. Castillo P. Matalonga J. Straccia M. Canals J.M.

Gaffen S.L. McGeachy M.J. CCAAT/Enhancer-binding protein β promotes pathogenesis of EAE.Cytokine. 2017; 92: 24-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Given that c/EBPβ orchestrates microglial transcriptional programs that promote inflammation and neuronal cell death, we investigated how levels of this transcription factor are regulated within microglia. Strikingly, we found that c/EBPβ is tightly regulated post-translationally, which is not reflected by changes in its transcript. Here, we identify COP1 as an important negative regulator of c/EBPβ. Deletion of Cop1 in microglia led to the accumulation of c/EBPβ and this engaged a potent pro-inflammatory gene expression program. Detailed analysis of the genes that were significantly altered upon Cop1 depletion suggested profound changes in microglia identity, highlighted by induction of a neurodegenerative-associated gene signature and concomitant loss of expression of homeostatic genes. Among the induced genes were important AD-associated risk factors, such as Apoe (Lambert et al., 2013Lambert J.C. Ibrahim-Verbaas C.A. Harold D. Naj A.C. Sims R. Bellenguez C. DeStafano A.L. Bis J.C.

This led to elevated neuronal death in vitro, which could be attributed to complement activation. The effects observed with deletion of Cop1 could be ameliorated by loss of one allele of Cebpb. Highlighting the importance of the in vitro findings, Cop1 deletion in the microglial population accelerated disease progression in a mouse model of tau-mediated neurodegeneration, where activated microglia play a deleterious role (Shi et al., 2017Shi Y. Yamada K. Liddelow S.A. Smith S.T. Zhao L. Luo W. Tsai R.M. Spina S. Grinberg L.T.

This study identifies a requirement for COP1 as a “brake” on c/EBPβ-mediated neuroinflammation. Upon an activating stimulus, such as LPS, COP1 is rapidly inactivated in an ERK-dependent manner, allowing for c/EBPβ accumulation and execution of a pro-inflammatory gene program. We show that absence of an efficient brake could lead to chronic neuro-inflammation, which has been shown to contribute to AD pathogenesis (Akiyama et al., 2000Akiyama H. Barger S. Barnum S. Bradt B. Bauer J. Cole G.M. Cooper N.R. Eikelenboom P. Emmerling M. Fiebich B.L. et al.Inflammation and Alzheimer’s disease.Neurobiol. Aging. 2000; 21: 383-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (3332) Google Scholar). The Cebpb gene is expressed highly in macrophages and microglia, where it plays an important role in determining their activation state. c/EBPβ protein, however, is barely detectable by immunoblotting under unstimulated growth conditions (Strohmeyer et al., 2014Strohmeyer R. Shelton J. Lougheed C. Breitkopf T. CCAAT-enhancer binding protein-β expression and elevation in Alzheimer’s disease and microglial cell cultures.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9: e86617Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Given that another member of the c/EBP family, c/EBPα, is regulated post-translationally by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (Keeshan et al., 2010Keeshan K. Bailis W. Dedhia P.H. Vega M.E. Shestova O. Xu L. Toscano K. Uljon S.N. Blacklow S.C. Pear W.S.

COP1 targets C/EBPα for degradation and induces acute myeloid leukemia via Trib1.Blood. 2013; 122: 1750-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), we investigated whether proteasomal degradation of c/EBPβ might explain its highly discordant protein and mRNA levels. Indeed, the proteasome inhibitor MG132 caused c/EBPβ protein, but not Cebpb mRNA, to increase in wild-type mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) within 30 min (Figure 1A). By mass spectrometry, the only ubiquitin ligase co-immunoprecipitating with endogenous c/EBPβ from BMDMs was COP1 (Figure 1B). In mammals, COP1 is a substrate adaptor in the multi-subunit cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase CRL4COP1/DET1 (Figure 1C; Wertz et al., 2004Wertz I.E. O’Rourke K.M. Zhang Z. Dornan D. Arnott D.

Substrates of CRL4COP1/DET1 include the transcription factors c-JUN, ETV1, ETV4, ETV5, ETS1, ETS2, and c/EBPα (Keeshan et al., 2010Keeshan K. Bailis W. Dedhia P.H. Vega M.E. Shestova O. Xu L.

Consistent with CRL4COP1/DET1 promoting proteasomal degradation of c/EBPβ, ectopically expressed c/EBPβ was less abundant in HEK293 cells when co-expressed with COP1 and DET1 (Figure 1D). Mutation of the substrate binding site in COP1 (Jamieson et al., 2018Jamieson S.A. Ruan Z. Burgess A.E. Curry J.R. McMillan H.D. Brewster J.L. Dunbier A.K. Axtman A.D. Kannan N. Mace P.D.

Constitutive deletion of Cop1 is lethal during mouse development around embryonic day 9 (Migliorini et al., 2011Migliorini D. Bogaerts S. Defever D. Vyas R. Denecker G. Radaelli E. Zwolinska A. Depaepe V. Hochepied T. Skarnes W.C. Marine J.C. Cop1 constitutively regulates c-Jun protein stability and functions as a tumor suppressor in mice.J. Clin. Invest. 2011; 121: 1329-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the role of COP1 in BMDMs and primary microglia using mice bearing conditional alleles of Cop1 (Cop1fl/fl) (Vitari et al., 2011Vitari A.C. Leong K.G. Newton K. Yee C. O’Rourke K. Liu J. Phu L. Vij R. Ferrando R. Couto S.S. et al.COP1 is a tumour suppressor that causes degradation of ETS transcription factors.Nature. 2011; 474: 403-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and a Rosa26-CreERT2 transgene (Seibler et al., 2003Seibler J. Zevnik B. Küter-Luks B. Andreas S. Kern H. Hennek T. Rode A. Heimann C. Faust N. Kauselmann G. et al.Rapid generation of inducible mouse mutants.Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: e12Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Primary microglia from newborn brains and BMDMs derived from adult bone marrow (Lian et al., 2016Lian H. Roy E. Zheng H. Protocol for Primary Microglial Culture Preparation.Biol. Protoc. 2016; 6: e1989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Trouplin et al., 2013Trouplin V. Boucherit N. Gorvel L. Conti F. Mottola G. Ghigo E. Bone marrow-derived macrophage production.J. Vis. Exp. 2013; : e50966PubMed Google Scholar) were treated with 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) for 48 h (Figure 1E). Cop1fl/fl Rosa26-CreERT2 cells, which lacked detectable COP1, and hereafter are referred to as COP1 knockout (KO) cells, contained much more c/EBPβ protein than control Cop1+/+ Rosa26-CreERT2 cells (hereafter referred to as COP1 wild-type [WT] cells) (Figures 1F and 1G). However, levels of Cebpb mRNA were slightly reduced by Cop1 deletion (Figure S1A). These data indicate that COP1 is crucial for post-translational suppression of c/EBPβ protein levels in microglia and macrophages (Figure 1H). The COP1-interacting protein STK40 (Durzynska et al., 2017Durzynska I. Xu X. Adelmant G. Ficarro S.B. Marto J.A. Sliz P. Uljon S. Blacklow S.C. STK40 Is a Pseudokinase that Binds the E3 Ubiquitin Ligase COP1.Structure. 2017; 25: 287-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), which was detected in c/EBPβ complexes from BMDMs (Figure 1B), also appeared to contribute to the suppression of c/EBPβ in microglia. Specifically, deletion of the STK40 pseudokinase increased the amount of c/EBPβ protein without increasing the amount of Cebpb mRNA (Figures S1B and S1C). Cebpb mRNA was actually decreased in the STK40-deficient microglia, which might indicate a negative feedback mechanism wherein c/EBPβ directly or indirectly suppresses its own transcription. STK40 is a distant homolog of the Tribbles-family proteins, TRIB1 and TRIB2, which interact with COP1 and have been implicated in the degradation of c/EBPα (Keeshan et al., 2010Keeshan K. Bailis W. Dedhia P.H. Vega M.E. Shestova O. Xu L. Toscano K. Uljon S.N. Blacklow S.C. Pear W.S. Transformation by Tribbles homolog 2 (Trib2) requires both the Trib2 kinase domain and COP1 binding.Blood. 2010; 116: 4948-4957Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar; Yoshida et al., 2013Yoshida A. Kato J.Y. Nakamae I. Yoneda-Kato N. COP1 targets C/EBPα for degradation and induces acute myeloid leukemia via Trib1.Blood. 2013; 122: 1750-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The precise nature of the interactions between COP1, STK40, and c/EBPβ warrants further investigation in the future. Post-translational regulation of protein stability, including transcription factors, allows for an especially acute alteration in levels in response to stimuli, independent of time-consuming transcription. The prototypical example is the transcription factor HIF-1α (Kamura et al., 2000Kamura T. Sato S. Iwai K. Czyzyk-Krzeska M. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Activation of HIF1alpha ubiquitination by a reconstituted von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor complex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 10430-10435Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). A variety of extracellular signals, including LPS, activate c/EBPβ-dependent pro-inflammatory gene expression programs (Ramji and Foka, 2002Ramji D.P. Foka P. CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins: structure, function and regulation.Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 561-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined the effect of LPS on c/EBPβ levels. Microglia contained more c/EBPβ and more of the COP1 substrate ETV5 (Vitari et al., 2011Vitari A.C. Leong K.G. Newton K. Yee C. O’Rourke K. Liu J. Phu L. Vij R. Ferrando R. Couto S.S. et al.COP1 is a tumour suppressor that causes degradation of ETS transcription factors.Nature. 2011; 474: 403-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) after treatment with LPS for 1 h, even in the presence of the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D (Figure 1I). In contrast, LPS-induced upregulation of A20 (also called TNFAIP3), which relies on de novo gene transcription, was prevented by actinomycin D (Figure 1I). Thus, LPS increased the amount of c/EBPβ independent of de novo gene transcription. LPS activates the MEK-ERK1/2 kinase pathway (Guha et al., 2001Guha M. O’Connell M.A. Pawlinski R. Hollis A. McGovern P. Yan S.F. Stern D. Mackman N. Lipopolysaccharide activation of the MEK-ERK1/2 pathway in human monocytic cells mediates tissue factor and tumor necrosis factor alpha expression by inducing Elk-1 phosphorylation and Egr-1 expression.Blood. 2001; 98: 1429-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar; Zhao et al., 2019Zhao J.

Rep. 2019; 9: 5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), which in turn inhibits CRL4COP1/DET1, allowing substrates of the ubiquitin ligase to accumulate (Zhang et al., 2017Zhang Z. Newton K. Kummerfeld S.K. Webster J. Kirkpatrick D.S. Phu L. Eastham-Anderson J. Liu J. Lee W.P. Wu J. et al.Transcription factor Etv5 is essential for the maintenance of alveolar type II cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114: 3903-3908Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Consistent with ERK negatively regulating COP1-dependent degradation of c/EBPβ, microglia treated with a combination of LPS and ERK inhibitor Vertex11e (Aronov et al., 2009Aronov A.M. Tang Q. Martinez-Botella G. Bemis G.W. Cao J. Chen G. Ewing N.P. Ford P.J. Germann U.A.

Chem. 2009; 52: 6362-6368Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) contained less c/EBPβ than cells treated with LPS alone (Figures 1J and 1K). Given that c/EBPβ regulates the expression of genes involved in microglia activation (Straccia et al., 2011Straccia M. Gresa-Arribas N. Dentesano G. Ejarque-Ortiz A. Tusell J.M. Serratosa J. Solà C.

RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed that genes involved in inflammatory and host defense responses were upregulated significantly in COP1 KO microglia when compared with COP1 WT microglia (p values = 5.49e−5 and 7.76e−21, respectively, hypergeometric test) (Figures 2A and 2E ). Similar sets of genes were induced in WT microglia treated with LPS for 6 h (Figure 2A), suggesting that absent an activating stimulus, loss of COP1 alone is sufficient to trigger an LPS-like pro-inflammatory gene expression program. We determined whether COP1 regulates proinflammatory gene expression in microglia in vivo by restricting deletion of Cop1 to microglia in the brain with a tamoxifen-inducible Cx3cr1-CreERT2-eYFP allele (Wong et al., 2017Wong K. Noubade R. Manzanillo P. Ota N. Foreman O. Hackney J.A. Friedman B.A. Pappu R. Scearce-Levie K. Ouyang W. Mice deficient in NRROS show abnormal microglial development and neurological disorders.Nat. Immunol. 2017; 18: 633-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Microglia were isolated from Cop1fl/fl Cx3cr1-CreERT2-eYFP and Cop1+l+ Cx3cr1-CreERT2-eYFP mice at 2–3 weeks after tamoxifen treatment by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). RNA-seq revealed that expression of pro-inflammatory genes, including Ccl5, Cxcl2, Cxcl10, and Il12b, was elevated significantly by COP1 deficiency (Figures 2B and 2C). Expression of Apoe, the major risk factor in AD (Safieh et al., 2019Safieh M. Korczyn A.D. Michaelson D.M.

We find neurons of the Fmr1-/y mouse have a mitochondrial inner membrane contributing to a leak metabolism. In human Fragile X syndrome (FXS) fibroblasts and in Fmr1-/y mouse neurons, closure of the ATP synthase channel by mild depletion of its c-subunit or pharmacological inhibition normalizes stimulus-induced and constitutive mRNA translation rate, decreases lactate and key glycolytic and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzyme levels, and triggers synapse maturation. FMRP regulates closure in wild-type (WT), but not FX synapses, by stimulus-dependent ATP synthase β subunit translation; this increases the ratio of ATP synthase enzyme to its c-subunit, enhancing ATP production efficiency and synaptic growth. In contrast, in FXS, inability to close developmental c-subunit prevents stimulus-dependent synaptic maturation. Therefore, ATP synthase c-subunit closure encourages development and attenuates autistic behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W3048889403,"As human activities intensify, the structures of ecosystems and their food webs often reorganize. Through the study of mesocosms harboring a diverse benthic coastal community, we reveal that food web architecture can be inflexible under ocean warming and acidification and unable to compensate for the decline or proliferation of taxa. Key stabilizing processes, including functional redundancy, trophic compensation, and species substitution, were largely absent under future climate conditions. A trophic pyramid emerged in which biomass expanded at the base and top but contracted in the center. This structure may characterize a transitionary state before collapse into shortened, bottom-heavy food webs that characterize ecosystems subject to persistent abiotic stress. We show that where food web architecture lacks adjustability, the adaptive capacity of ecosystems to global change is weak and ecosystem degradation likely."
https://openalex.org/W3048792612,"More than half of all tropical forests are degraded by human impacts, leaving them threatened with conversion to agricultural plantations and risking substantial biodiversity and carbon losses. Restoration could accelerate recovery of aboveground carbon density (ACD), but adoption of restoration is constrained by cost and uncertainties over effectiveness. We report a long-term comparison of ACD recovery rates between naturally regenerating and actively restored logged tropical forests. Restoration enhanced decadal ACD recovery by more than 50%, from 2.9 to 4.4 megagrams per hectare per year. This magnitude of response, coupled with modal values of restoration costs globally, would require higher carbon prices to justify investment in restoration. However, carbon prices required to fulfill the 2016 Paris climate agreement [$40 to $80 (USD) per tonne carbon dioxide equivalent] would provide an economic justification for tropical forest restoration."
https://openalex.org/W3049646937,"How is neuropathic pain regulated in peripheral sensory neurons? Importins are key regulators of nucleocytoplasmic transport. In this study, we found that importin α3 (also known as karyopherin subunit alpha 4) can control pain responsiveness in peripheral sensory neurons in mice. Importin α3 knockout or sensory neuron-specific knockdown in mice reduced responsiveness to diverse noxious stimuli and increased tolerance to neuropathic pain. Importin α3-bound c-Fos and importin α3-deficient neurons were impaired in c-Fos nuclear import. Knockdown or dominant-negative inhibition of c-Fos or c-Jun in sensory neurons reduced neuropathic pain. In silico screens identified drugs that mimic importin α3 deficiency. These drugs attenuated neuropathic pain and reduced c-Fos nuclear localization. Thus, perturbing c-Fos nuclear import by importin α3 in peripheral neurons can promote analgesia."

This resetting could decrease the impact of epigenetic factors and thus overcome variability in differentiation potential among different mESC lines. However, systematic studies are still lacking to fully demonstrate this possibility. Of note, a number of studies have developed ground-state conditions for the production of naive hPSCs (Gafni et al., 2013Gafni O. Weinberger L. Mansour A.A. Manor Y.S. Chomsky E. Ben-Yosef D.

However, the resulting lines are often challenging to grow, are genetically variable in some conditions, and require an initial capacitation step prior to multi-lineage differentiation (Rostovskaya et al., 2019Rostovskaya M. Stirparo G.G. Smith A. Capacitation of human naïve pluripotent stem cells for multi-lineage differentiation.Development. 2019; 146https://dev.biologists.org/content/146/7/dev172916Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Therefore, the hypothesis that ground-state culture conditions and the associated epigenetic resetting can overcome phenotypic variability observed in genetically diverse pluripotent stem cell lines remains to be experimentally tested. Here, we decided to address this issue by taking advantage of 12 inbred mESC lines from four common laboratory strains, along with transcriptome data from 185 outbred mESC lines (Diversity Outbred) from the Collaborative Cross (Churchill et al., 2004Churchill G.A. Airey D.C. Allayee H. Angel J.M. Attie A.D. Beatty J. Beavis W.D. Belknap J.K. Bennett B. Berrettini W. et al.Complex Trait ConsortiumThe Collaborative Cross, a community resource for the genetic analysis of complex traits.Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 1133-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). These lines were assessed for their potential to generate different cell types, and we observed that naive pluripotent stem cells derived from the same strain display a consistent capacity of differentiation. However, cell lines with different genetic background display strikingly divergent capacities to produce specific cell types. Furthermore, Wnt signaling regulation and activity varies among different strains, both in pluripotency and during differentiation. Finally, we identified eQTL suggesting that the activity of major signaling pathways could be controlled by genetic variants. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that genetic mechanisms strongly influence the efficacy of differentiation in vitro, and resetting the epigenetic state of pluripotent stem cells might not be sufficient to bypass phenotypic variability. Individual mESC lines were derived from different blastocysts of four different strains (CAST/EiJ [CAST], C57BL/6J [B6], C3H/HeJ [C3H], and PWD/PhJ [PWD]; Figure 1A). These lines displayed a normal karyotype, formed chimeras, and showed germline contribution (Skelly et al., 2020Skelly D.A. Czechanski A. Byers C. Aydin S. Spruce C. Olivier C. Choi K. Gatti D.M. Raghupathy N.

Protoc. 2014; 9: 559-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar; Figure S1A). For this study, naive mESCs were grown in ground-state conditions in the presence of LIF, the GSK3 (α and β) inhibitor CHIR99021, and the MEK inhibitor PD0325901, as described (Ying et al., 2008Ying Q.-L. Wray J. Nichols J. Batlle-Morera L. Doble B. Woodgett J. Cohen P. Smith A. The ground state of embryonic stem cell self-renewal.Nature. 2008; 453: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (2544) Google Scholar). All lines grew as dome-shaped colonies characteristic of mouse pluripotent stem cells (Figure 1B). They also homogeneously expressed pluripotency markers and shared a similar cell cycle profile (Figures 1C, 1D, and S1B–S1D). Interestingly, bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) confirmed that conventional pluripotency markers were expressed at similar levels among naive mESC lines of the same strain, with few exceptions (Figure 1E; Skelly et al., 2020Skelly D.A. Czechanski A. Byers C. Aydin S. Spruce C. Olivier C. Choi K. Gatti D.M. Raghupathy N. Keele G.R. et al.Mapping the effects of genetic variation on chromatin state and gene expression reveals loci that control ground state pluripotency.Cell Stem Cell. 2020; 27 (Published online August 13, 2020)https://doi.org/10.1016/j.stem.2020.07.019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar). However, a broad number of genes were differentially expressed (Figure 1E) among lines from different genetic backgrounds. Similarly, unsupervised principal-component analysis (PCA) of global gene expression profiles showed that cells from different strains have divergent transcriptomic profiles (Figure 1F). A list of genes contributing to this divergence can be found in Table S2. Interestingly, Gene Ontology analysis of driver genes for PC1 related to molecular function yielded the following significant contributions: calcium ion binding, transmembrane signaling receptor activity, signaling receptor activity, molecular transducer activity, and endopeptidase activity. This hints at differences in signaling activity of several pathways in different genetic backgrounds. Importantly, single-cell transcriptional profiling revealed that this effect is not caused by the presence of sub-populations of cells in our culture conditions. On the contrary, mESCs grown in ground-state conditions represent a homogeneous population expressing canonical pluripotency markers while displaying expression profiles specific for each genetic background (Figures 1G, 1H, and S1E). These results, combined with the analysis presented by Skelly et al., 2020Skelly D.A. Czechanski A. Byers C. Aydin S. Spruce C. Olivier C. Choi K. Gatti D.M. Raghupathy N. Keele G.R. et al.Mapping the effects of genetic variation on chromatin state and gene expression reveals loci that control ground state pluripotency.Cell Stem Cell. 2020; 27 (Published online August 13, 2020)https://doi.org/10.1016/j.stem.2020.07.019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar, show that the genetic background of naive mESCs is a primary determinant of their transcriptional profiles, paralleling previous observations obtained with hPSCs (Rouhani et al., 2014Rouhani F. Kumasaka N. de Brito M.C. Bradley A. Vallier L. Gaffney D. Genetic background drives transcriptional variation in human induced pluripotent stem cells.PLoS Genet. 2014; 10: e1004432Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In order to further investigate the functional impact of genetic background, three independently derived naive mESC lines from each mouse strain were differentiated simultaneously using the same culture conditions to minimize experimental variations. We first tested their differentiation capacity in an unguided manner by simply withdrawing 2i and LIF (Figure 2A). In these conditions, mESCs differentiate toward the neurectoderm lineage without the need for additional factors (Tropepe et al., 2001Tropepe V. Hitoshi S. Sirard C. Mak T.W. Rossant J. van der Kooy D. Direct neural fate specification from embryonic stem cells: a primitive mammalian neural stem cell stage acquired through a default mechanism.Neuron. 2001; 30: 65-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Efficiency of differentiation was measured by quantifying the fraction of cells expressing the neuroectoderm marker SOX1 after 6 days. All the lines tested were able to produce neuroectoderm cells, confirming their pluripotent state. However, the fraction of SOX1-expressing cells varied substantially among lines from different genetic backgrounds (Figures 2B, 2C, S2A, and S2B). B6 mESCs showed the highest neuroectoderm capacity, whereas the PWD lines were the least efficient in producing SOX1-expressing cells. Overall, genetic background had a strong and statistically significant effect on differentiation to neuroectoderm (paired t test; Figures 2C and S2B). Thus, naive mESCs display different capacities of differentiation toward the “default” neuroectoderm lineage, and this variability seems to be defined by their genetic background. We then decided to probe the potential of naive ESC lines for a different cell fate controlled by inductive cues. For that, cells were grown for 6 days in culture conditions promoting definitive endoderm (Figure 2D), and differentiation efficiency was quantified by measuring the fraction of cells expressing SOX17. Interestingly, CAST mESCs produced the largest number of SOX17+ cells, while B6 mESCs showed the lowest differentiation efficiency (Figures 2E, 2F, S2C, and S2D). Again, the genetic background had a significant effect on the differentiation efficiency (paired t test; Figure 2F). Importantly, mESCs do not generate endoderm cells directly, as only late epiblast cells have this capacity. Consequently, germ-layer specification can be achieved only after transition through different pluripotent states (Smith, 2017Smith A. Formative pluripotency: the executive phase in a developmental continuum.Development. 2017; 144: 365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). On the other hand, mESCs can directly give rise to primitive endoderm. Thus, we decided to test the capacity of naive ESC lines for this differentiation by taking advantage of a protocol based on defined culture conditions (Anderson et al., 2017Anderson K.G.V. Hamilton W.B. Roske F.V. Azad A. Knudsen T.E. Canham M.A. Forrester L.M. Brickman J.M. Insulin fine-tunes self-renewal pathways governing naive pluripotency and extra-embryonic endoderm.Nat. Cell Biol. 2017; 19: 1164-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Interestingly, CAST mESCs displayed a limited capacity to form primitive endoderm, while PWD mESCs were able to produce cells with distinctive morphology (Figure 2G) expressing Gata6, Sox7, Pdgfrα, and Sparc (Figure 2H). Of note, production of primitive endoderm cells was challenging, with most naive ESC lines suggesting that this direct route of differentiation could benefit from further optimization. Nonetheless, these analyses confirm that genetic background influence the capacity of naive mESCs to directly generate differentiated progenies. Finally, we decided to investigate if this variability could also affect the ability of naive mESC lines to generate more mature cell types. For that, naive mESC lines were differentiated into cardiomyocytes and hematopoietic cells (Ditadi et al., 2015Ditadi A. Sturgeon C.M. Tober J. Awong G. Kennedy M. Yzaguirre A.D. Azzola L. Ng E.S. Stanley E.G. French D.L. et al.Human definitive haemogenic endothelium and arterial vascular endothelium represent distinct lineages.Nat. Cell Biol. 2015; 17: 580-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Interestingly, CAST mESCs displayed the higher capacity to generate cardiac and blood cells, whereas the PWD strain seems to be giving rise to cardiomyocytes but not hematopoietic cells under the chosen conditions (Figures S2E–S2H). Thus, variability among naive ESC lines is not limited to early stages of differentiation. In sum, our data suggest that naive mESC lines from different strains show different propensities for lineage priming and commitment under identical culture conditions. Specifically, B6 and C3H mESC lines showed the highest efficiency in generating ectoderm, CAST mESCs the highest capacity for definitive endoderm and mesoderm derivatives, and PWD mESCs the highest capacity to form primitive endoderm. Thus, the differentiation capacity of naive mESCs appears to be heavily influenced by their genetic background. We then opted to resolve the precise stage at which the differentiation capacity of mESC lines starts to diverge by studying the transition between the naive and the post-implantation epiblast state (EpiLCs; Buecker et al., 2014Buecker C. Srinivasan R. Wu Z. Calo E. Acampora D. Faial T. Simeone A. Tan M. Swigut T. Wysocka J. Reorganization of enhancer patterns in transition from naive to primed pluripotency.Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 14: 838-853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). mESCs were grown for 2 days in N2B27 medium in the absence of 2i LIF, and the proportion of cells expressing OTX2 was evaluated. This transcription factor is necessary to exit the naive state and is also required to protect EpiLCs from premature neuroectoderm specification (Acampora et al., 2013Acampora D. Di Giovannantonio L.G. Simeone A. Otx2 is an intrinsic determinant of the embryonic stem cell state and is required for transition to a stable epiblast stem cell condition.Development. 2013; 140: 43-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar; Yang et al., 2014Yang S.-H. Kalkan T. Morissroe C. Marks H. Stunnenberg H. Smith A. Sharrocks A.D. Otx2 and Oct4 drive early enhancer activation during embryonic stem cell transition from naive pluripotency.Cell Rep. 2014; 7: 1968-1981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). A high proportion of OTX2-positive cells were detected in differentiating CAST and PWD mESCs, whereas B6 and C3H mESCs showed fewer positive cells (Figures 3A, 3B, and S3A). Interestingly, Nanog was quickly and homogeneously downregulated in all of the lines, while upregulation of canonical Epiblast markers such as Fgf5 showed more variation (Figure 3C). Thus, the transition toward the post-implantation epiblast state seems to be affected rather than the exit from the naive state. A more detailed examination revealed that the dynamics of OTX2 expression differed among cell lines derived from different genetic backgrounds. Indeed, the number of cells positive for OTX2 (Figure 3D) peaked earlier and at lower levels for C3H mESCs, while CAST and PWD lines achieved the highest expression levels 12 h later. Finally, B6 lines were very inefficient in inducing OTX2 expression, as fewer than 50% of the cells were positive after 36 h. Importantly, this pattern of expression fits with the role of OTX2 in cell fate decision, as B6 mESC lines display the highest efficiency for neuroectoderm differentiation. These observations were reinforced by qPCR analyses of key marker genes showing that lines from different genetic backgrounds displayed substantial variability during the transition out of naive pluripotency (Figure S3B). We further confirmed these observations by performing single-cell RNA-seq during a short time course of differentiation in the N2B27 conditions. Clustering and PAGA analyses by accounting for 300 PCs showed transcriptional similarity within strains and relative strain similarity compared with a negative control (mouse embryonic fibroblasts; see Figure S3C; Table S1B; and https://github.com/theislab/paga), thereby confirming the pluripotent identity of the cell lines used in this study. PCAs (Figure 3E) showed that the biggest variance (PC1) is explained by differentiation (0–48 h), as cells exiting pluripotency (Figure S3D) drastically change their gene expression profile. The second major component (PC2) separates the different genetic backgrounds. Although the transcriptomic profile of B6 and C3H cells cluster together, those of CAST and PWD are clearly separate, reaffirming the substantial differences in gene expression driven by genetic backgrounds. The higher levels of Otx2 induction in CAST and PWD cell line was confirmed in this dataset (Figure 3F). In addition, B6 and C3H lines display rapid upregulation of Sox1 transcripts (Figure 3F), reflecting a higher propensity for neurectodermal differentiation. Taken together, these data suggest that variability in naive mESCs originates from their capacity to transition into post-implantation epiblast cells and from the expression of key regulators of this process such as OTX2. To uncover the potential drivers of this variability, we tested the importance of different signaling pathways for the transition between naive mESCs and EpiLCs (Figures 4A and S4A). Neither ERK or TGF-β pathway modulation seemed to affect OTX2 expression. On the other hand, addition of the GSK3 inhibitor CHIR99021 and subsequent increase of canonical Wnt β-catenin signaling led to a drastic reduction of OTX2-positive cells, suggesting a delay in the transition toward post-implantation pluripotent states (Figure S4B). We then asked whether a divergence in canonical Wnt signaling could explain the observed phenotypes during the transition to EpiLCs and assessed the levels of active β-catenin in the different naive mESC lines. These analyses revealed marked differences in the levels of active β-catenin among different genetic backgrounds (Figure 4B), with PWD mESCs showing the highest level of active β-catenin. Similar results were obtained upon the withdrawal of 2i LIF (in N2B27 basal medium), suggesting that the observed variation in Wnt signaling activity persisted after induction of differentiation (Figure 4B). Evaluation of the level of total β-catenin in the nuclear enriched fraction of the different lines also showed the same trend (Figures S4C and S4D). Importantly, these differences were confirmed using the TOP FLASH luciferase assay as a direct measure of canonical Wnt signaling activity (Figure 4C), as well as by qPCR for the levels of Axin2, a downstream target of canonical Wnt signaling and Lef1 (Figure 4D). Thus, Wnt signaling activity appears to vary between mESC lines of different genetic backgrounds. Importantly, similar results were obtained with naive hPSC lines derived from three different individuals, indicating that variability in signaling pathways essential for differentiation could be shared between species (Figures S4E and S4F). To confirm the influence of this variation on differentiation, we investigated whether blocking Wnt signaling during differentiation of naive ESCs could be beneficial (ten Berge et al., 2011ten Berge D. Kurek D. Blauwkamp T. Koole W. Maas A. Eroglu E. Siu R.K. Nusse R. Embryonic stem cells require Wnt proteins to prevent differentiation to epiblast stem cells.Nat.

A simple and robust method for establishing homogeneous mouse epiblast stem cell lines by wnt inhibition.Stem Cell Reports. 2015; 4: 744-757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Indeed, addition of the PORCN inhibitor IWP2 increased the expression of OTX2 during the transition between naive to EpiLC state, especially in lines that showed lower levels of OTX2 in its absence (Figures 4E and S4G). Nevertheless, this increase did vary among mESC lines, suggesting that Wnt inhibition only partially decreases the variability in differentiation capacity. We also noted that the basal level of Wnt signaling activity did not correlate systematically with OTX2 expression. As an example, PWD mESC lines display high levels of Wnt activity while also expressing a high level of OTX2. Thus, transition from the naive state is likely to be controlled by complex interplays among several signaling pathways. This notion was reinforced further by a quantitative scre"

However, good data for understanding patterns and inclusiveness of this transformation are often lacking. This is important given implications for policy design and service and technology provision towards better performing dairy sectors in these settings. Relying on a combination of unique diverse large-scale datasets and methods, we analyze transformation patterns in the dairy value chain supplying Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, the second most populous country in Africa. Over the last decade, we note a rapid increase in expenditures on dairy products by urban consumers, especially among the better-off. Relatedly, the number of dairy processing firms in Ethiopia tripled over the same period, supplying a significant part of these dairy products, especially pasteurized milk, to the city’s residents. Upstream at the production level, we find improved access to livestock services, higher adoption of cross-bred cows, an increase in milk yields, expanding liquid milk markets, a sizable urban farm sector supplying almost one-third of all liquid milk consumed in the city, and an upscaling process with larger commercial dairy farms becoming more prevalent. However, average milk yields are still low and not all dairy farmers are included in this transformation process. Small farms with dairy animals as well as those in more remote areas benefit less from access to services and adopt less these modern practices. For these more disadvantaged farmers, stagnation in milk yields and even declines–depending on the data source used–are observed."

Derivation and in vitro propagation of pluripotent mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) are influenced by genetic background. The successful derivation of pluripotent mESC lines was first reported in 1981 using both inbred (substrains of 129, [C3HxC57BL/6] F1 hybrids) and outbred laboratory strains (Evans and Kaufman, 1981Evans M.J.

These early advances demonstrated that in vitro mESCs sustain their capacity to contribute to all embryonic lineages, including the germline (i.e., pluripotency), when propagated in media containing leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). However, these approaches were unsuccessful in other mouse strains such as nonobese diabetic (NOD), which proved recalcitrant to ESC derivation (Kawase et al., 1994Kawase E. Suemori H. Takahashi N.

The differential activation of intracellular signaling pathways confers the permissiveness of embryonic stem cell derivation from different mouse strains.Development. 2015; 142: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar went on to show that mESCs from other recalcitrant (CBA, FVB) or intermediate (BALB) strains depend on ERK1/2 and GSK3 inhibition to maintain self-renewal due to attenuated LIF responsiveness. While differential response to LIF is genetic, the associated signaling pathways involve hundreds of genes collectively harboring multitudes of coding and regulatory variants. Therefore, the underlying genetic differences that drive interstrain variation in mESC responsiveness to the cell culture environment remain a mystery.

DO mice segregate >40 million genetic variants with reasonably balanced founder allele frequencies and a simple population structure that enables high-resolution genetic mapping with relatively small sample sizes. To determine the genetic and molecular mechanisms leading to pluripotent ground state metastability, we derived mESCs from hundreds of DO mice and measured molecular phenotypes in cells grown in the absence of ERK1/2 inhibition. We reasoned that the genetic variation driving attenuated responsiveness to LIF would exert effects through differences in transcription. To test this idea, we took advantage of germline-competent, euploid mESC lines derived from the eight inbred founder strains of the mouse CC (Czechanski et al., 2014Czechanski A. Byers C. Greenstein I. Schrode N. Donahue L.R. Hadjantonakis A.-K. Reinholdt L.G. Derivation and characterization of mouse embryonic stem cells from permissive and nonpermissive strains.Nat. Protoc. 2014; 9: 559-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These include the classical laboratory strains C57BL/6J, A/J, 129S1/SvImJ, NZO/HILtJ, and NOD/ShiLtJ (referred to here as B6, AJ, 129S1, NZO, and NOD, respectively), as well as inbred wild-derived strains representing three subspecies of M. musculus, including WSB/EiJ (WSB, M.m. domesticus), CAST/EiJ (CAST, M.m. castaneus), and PWD/PhJ (PWD, M.m. musculus; a consubspecific inbred wild-derived strain with similar geographic origin to the CC founder strain PWK/PhJ [PWK]). We profiled genome-wide gene expression by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in 3 male mESCs from each strain (N = 24). Unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that inbred strain background explained the majority of transcriptional variability (Figure 1A). Moreover, we found significant differences in the expression of core pluripotency genes across genetic backgrounds (Figure 1B). Although core pluripotency transcription factors such as Nanog and Sox2 were highly expressed in all cell lines (Figures 1B, 1C, and S1), their expression varied markedly (often >2-fold) across strains (Figures 1B and S1). Among the top differentially expressed genes (false discovery rate [FDR] 5%; Table S1) were members of the cytokine receptor signaling pathways. Based on this pattern of expression and previous work (Silva et al., 2009Silva J. Nichols J. Theunissen T.W. Guo G. van Oosten A.L. Barrandon O. Wray J. Yamanaka S. Chambers I. Smith A. Nanog is the gateway to the pluripotent ground state.Cell. 2009; 138: 722-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar), we predicted that the removal of ERK1/2 and GSK3 inhibition would destabilize Nanog expression. These pathways act downstream of LIF and are proximal to genes that reinforce pluripotency. To test this, we introduced an in-frame self-cleaving mCherry reporter fused to the endogenous Nanog locus in all 24 inbred mESC lines. Upon the removal of 2i, the fraction of cells expressing Nanog was reduced in CAST, NOD, PWD, and WSB mESCs (Figures 1D and S1), demonstrating that mESCs from these backgrounds depend on ERK1/2 and GSK3 inhibition to maintain robust Nanog expression. We observed a similar pattern for SOX2 in CAST and PWD mESCs, while OCT3/4 expression remained stable (Figure S1). These observations confirm nonpermissive strain dependence on ERK1/2 and GSK3 inhibition and extend this phenotype to additional strains (Hanna et al., 2009Hanna J. Markoulaki S. Mitalipova M. Cheng A.W. Cassady J.P. Staerk J. Carey B.W. Lengner C.J. Foreman R.

Niwa H. The differential activation of intracellular signaling pathways confers the permissiveness of embryonic stem cell derivation from different mouse strains.Development. 2015; 142: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To understand the genetic control of these interstrain differences among mESCs, we leveraged the DO model (Figure 1E) by deriving ESCs from DO blastocysts. We selected 213 lines that met quality control criteria, including the availability of high-quality single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes (see Method Details). We expanded these mESCs under sensitized conditions in the absence of ERK1/2 inhibition to further expose transcriptional differences among the strains (Ying et al., 2008Ying Q.-L. Wray J. Nichols J. Batlle-Morera L. Doble B. Woodgett J. Cohen P. Smith A. The ground state of embryonic stem cell self-renewal.Nature. 2008; 453: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (2298) Google Scholar). To characterize our genetically diverse mESCs, we measured steady-state transcript abundance by RNA-seq (N = 185 lines) and chromatin accessibility as an indicator of regulatory element activity by assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) (N = 192 lines). Both assays were performed on a common set of 170 lines. We quantified the expression of 15,185 genes and chromatin accessibility at 102,173 genomic locations across the DO mESCs. Of these, 84% of transcripts (12,764) and 47% of open chromatin regions (47,786) showed heritable variation (FDR 5%). While all of the cell lines had high expression of pluripotency-related genes, expression was highly variable among the cell lines (Figure 2A). The variable activation of regulatory elements (i.e., promoters, enhancers, insulators), observed as changes in chromatin accessibility, may underlie variable gene expression. We observed open chromatin near promoters (Figure S2A), and gene expression was correlated with the variability in proximal chromatin accessibility (orange-red diagonal line in Figure 2B). To understand the genetic regulation of chromatin accessibility and gene expression in mESCs, we conducted quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping. We mapped 33,196 chromatin accessibility QTL (caQTL) for 30,458 distinct open chromatin regions (Figure 2D; LOD > 7.5, corresponding to a permutation-based genome-wide p < 0.05) and 6,589 gene expression QTL (eQTL) for 5,853 distinct genes (Figure 2E; LOD > 7.6, permutation-based genome-wide p < 0.05). Most QTL mapped near their target open chromatin region or transcript (69% of caQTL and 63% of eQTL), as can be seen by the clear diagonal bands in Figures 2D and 2E; these local associations likely drive much of the observed high correlation between chromatin accessibility and the transcript abundance of nearby genes (Figure 2B). We also identified multiple instances of loci that control chromatin accessibility and/or gene expression at hundreds of distal sites. These QTL hotspots (Schadt et al., 2003Schadt E.E. Monks S.A. Drake T.A. Lusis A.J. Che N. Colinayo V. Ruff T.G. Milligan S.B. Lamb J.R. Cavet G. et al.Genetics of gene expression surveyed in maize, mouse and man.Nature. 2003; 422: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar), seen as vertical bands in Figures 2D and 2E, are of interest because they likely harbor genes that regulate many molecular features throughout the genome in trans. For example, a QTL hotspot would be evident if genetic variation that affects the expression or function of a transcription factor affects many downstream target genes or open chromatin regions bound by that factor (Figure 2C, schematic). We identified 13 such QTL hotspots, 8 chromatin accessibility and 5 gene expression (Table S2), 3 of which affected both molecular phenotypes (Figure 2F). Although we found some evidence for aneuploidies in multiple DO mESC lines (Figure S2B), hotspot signals persisted after controlling for estimated aneuploidy (data not shown). Hotspot loci ranged in size from ∼1.5 to 10 Mb, and an average of 103 annotated genes were located inside or within 5 Mb of hotspot boundaries (range 36–228; Table S2). QTL hotspots regulated critical pathways driving pluripotent states. Two of the eQTL hotspots we identified were of particular interest as they independently regulate different gene networks related to the maintenance of pluripotency. An eQTL hotspot on chromosome (Chr) 10 influenced the expression of 100 target genes with a striking overlap with genes that are upregulated in the rare 2-cell (2C)-like state (47/123; p < 1 × 10−16; Hendrickson et al., 2017Hendrickson P.G.

Cells in the 2C-like state are totipotent and present in mESC cultures derived from B6/129 substrain backgrounds at low frequency (∼1%; Ishiuchi et al., 2015Ishiuchi T. Enriquez-Gasca R. Mizutani E.

Pfaff S.L. Embryonic stem cell potency fluctuates with endogenous retrovirus activity.Nature. 2012; 487: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). These cells are defined by their transcriptional similarity to totipotent early embryos, including characteristic activation of the endogenous retroviral element MERVL (Macfarlan et al., 2012Macfarlan T.S. Gifford W.D. Driscoll S. Lettieri K. Rowe H.M. Bonanomi D. Firth A. Singer O. Trono D. Pfaff S.L. Embryonic stem cell potency fluctuates with endogenous retrovirus activity.Nature. 2012; 487: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Expression of the MERVL long terminal repeat (MT2_mm) in our DO mESCs panel is strongly correlated with the expression of Chr 10 QTL target genes (ρ = 0.96; Figure S2C). In addition, we identified a QTL hotspot located on proximal Chr 15 (Figures 2D and 2E) that controls both the chromatin state and gene expression of distant target genes. In this Chr 15 QTL hotspot, the 254 target transcripts showed strong enrichment for genes with known roles in pluripotency, including Klf4, Lin28a, and Cxxc1. We estimated the haplotype effects on each target gene at the Chr 15 locus and found that mESCs from permissive strains (129S1, AJ, B6, and NZO, denoted as “REF” haplotype) were similarly affected by the Chr 15 QTL genotype, while mESCs from nonpermissive strains (CAST, NOD, PWK, and WSB, denoted as “ALT” haplotype) exhibited opposite effects (Figure 3A). The identification of QTL hotspots presented an opportunity to test whether local genetic variation within the hotspot influences target gene expression indirectly through the transcript abundance of a “mediator” gene (e.g., genetic variation → [mediator] → downstream targets; Figure 2C). We applied mediation analysis to each QTL hotspot (see Method Details; Chick et al., 2016Chick J.M. Munger S.C. Simecek P. Huttlin E.L. Choi K. Gatti D.M. Raghupathy N. Svenson K.L. Churchill G.A. Gygi S.P. Defining the consequences of genetic variation on a proteome-wide scale.Nature. 2016; 534: 500-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) to identify the candidates that are most likely to confer the observed QTL effect. We identified candidate genes regulating eQTL and caQTL hotspots on Chr 3 (Exosc8 regulating genes involved in the chromatin remodeling SWI-SNF complex) and Chr 5 (Steap2 regulating chromatin accessibility at 140 distant regions). We also found that abundance of the DUX transcript (Duxf3) was among the top two candidate mediators for the Chr 10 eQTL hotspot. This observation, in tandem with research identifying DUX as an activator of 2C-like genes (Hendrickson et al., 2017Hendrickson P.G. Doráis J.A. Grow E.J. Whiddon J.L. Lim J.-W. Wike C.L. Weaver B.D. Pflueger C. Emery B.R. Wilcox A.L. et al.Conserved roles of mouse DUX and human DUX4 in activating cleavage-stage genes and MERVL/HERVL retrotransposons.Nat. Genet. 2017; 49: 925-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), suggests that variation in Duxf3 expression drives this hotspot. Rather than indicating differences in the expression of 2C-like genes, this hotspot may reflect differences in cell state composition among DO mESC lines, with some lines having no or few cells in the 2C-like state and other lines having a higher frequency of cells in this state. Finally, we identified Lifr as the best mediator of the Chr 15 eQTL hotspot. Of the 175 Chr 15 target genes with significant mediators (FDR 5%), Lifr gene expression was the best mediator for 92 (53%) of them (Figures 3B–3D). Lifr encodes a protein that heterodimerizes with Glycoprotein 130 to form the LIF receptor. Given the known interstrain differences in LIF responsiveness, variation in Lifr expression is an attractive candidate for regulating the ability to respond to extracellular LIF, putatively influencing metastability. QTL mapping of Lifr transcript abundance revealed a strong local eQTL. Therefore, we surmised that a cis-regulatory variant may directly influence Lifr expression and cause the differential expression of downstream genes. To validate Lifr expression as the direct effector of the Chr 15 QTL hotspot in an orthogonal genetic system, we derived mESCs from F1 intercrosses of recombinant inbred CC lines (CC-RIX) segregating the same genetic variation as DO mice. We quantified the expression of a subset of 5 Chr 15 eQTL target genes that were predicted to be mediated by Lifr expression (Rbp1, Cxcl12, Hap1, Klf4, and Socs3) by qRT-PCR in CC-RIX mESCs. The expression of each of these genes was correlated with Lifr expression in the CC-RIX lines, and both the magnitude and direction of this correlation agreed with our results in the DO mESCs (Figure S3), supporting our prediction that the locus containing Lifr is the primary causal mediator of genes in the Chr 15 QTL hotspot. Self-renewal is an important property of pluripotent cells that is lost upon lineage commitment, and differences in self-renewal underlie mESC permissiveness. To quantitatively examine the functional significance of Lifr genotype on self-renewal, we tested the ability of CC-RIX lines to proliferate from single cells in colony-forming assays. The Lifr genotype was a good predictor of self-renewal, with lines homozygous for the low-expressing ALT allele showing abrogated self-renewal (Figure 3E; Table S3; p = 1.2 × 10−7; linear model testing contribution of Lifr genotype to self-renewal including a culture media covariate). To identify the causal genetic variant(s) within the Chr 15 QTL hotspot, we searched for genetic variants that matched the REF and ALT haplotype effects observed for the QTL targets (Figure 3A). Although there are >20,000 segregating genetic variants in DO mice within the 1.5-Mb region surrounding Lifr, only 185 variants matched this unusual 4:4 strain pattern. Given that Lifr shows a local eQTL and our observation that local chromatin accessibility correlates with gene expression (Figure 2B), we used variation in regions of open chromatin within ±2 Mb surrounding Lifr to identify the putative regulatory elements. The best-mediating open chromatin region was located ∼10 kb upstream of the transcriptional start site of Lifr, and colocalizes with a DNaseI hypersensitive site that is unique to mESCs (Figure 4A). A SNP with the unusual 4:4 strain genotype split lies at the apex of this chromatin accessibility peak (SNP rs50454566, GRCm38/mm10 chr15:7116944, T/A). DO mESCs homozygous for the alternate allele (A/A, present on the ALT haplotype carried by nonpermissive strains) had reduced chromatin accessibility and Lifr expression compared to lines homozygous for the mouse reference allele (T/T, present on REF haplotype carried by permissive strains; Figure 4B). RNA-seq on founder inbred strain mESCs and qRT-PCR of CC-RIX lines confirmed the correlation between strain genotypes at this SNP and Lifr gene expression, with the reference genotype (T/T) associated with higher Lifr expression (Figures S4A and S4B). We also observed concordant patterns of LIFR protein expression by flow cytometry of 129S1 (REF) and NOD (ALT) mESCs (Figure S4C). Moreover, an ∼500-bp fragment of the open chromatin carrying the REF genotype drove higher reporter expression in vitro than the same fragment carrying the ALT genotype (Figure 4C). To validate this SNP as a causal variant, founder strain Nanog-mCherry mESC lines with opposing rs50454566 genotypes (129S1 [T/T] versus NOD and WSB [A/A]) were edited to create reciprocal allele swaps, as many hotspot targets are regulated by Nanog (Zheng et al., 2019Zheng R. Wan C. Mei S. Qin Q. Wu Q. Sun H. Chen C.-H. Brown M. Zhang X. Meyer C.A. Liu X.S. Cistrome Data Browser: expanded datasets and new tools for gene regulatory analysis.Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47: D729-D735Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Replacing the reference allele in 129S1 with the alternate allele (129S1[A/A]) resulted in reduced Lifr transcript abundance (Figure 4D) and Nanog-mCherry expression (Figure S4D). Reciprocally, replacing the alternate allele with reference on the NOD genetic background (NOD[T/T]) increased Lifr expression (Figure 4D; comparable results for WSB allele swap lines, WSB[T/T], are shown in Figures S4D and S4F). In culture conditions depleted of LIF, the allele swap had a striking impact on colony morphology. Replacement of the single SNP corrected the poor colony morphology of mESCs derived from both NOD and WSB backgrounds (Figure 4E and S4E). PCA of genome-wide gene expression from these strains revealed that both allele swaps increased the transcriptional similarity to parental lines carrying the swapped allele (Figure 4F). Focusing on the target genes of the Chr 15 hotspot, allele-swapped 129S1[A/A] mESCs showed a reduced expression of pluripotency-related genes compared to the unaltered 129S1 mESCs, and allele-swap gene expression changes were concordant with predictions made from eQTL mapping (Figure 4G; Fisher’s exact test; p < 2 × 10−16). In contrast, allele-swapped NOD[T/T] mESCs exhibited a higher expression of genes that promote pluripotency relative to the parent NOD mESCs, with overall gene expression patterns resembling 129S1 lines. The changes in Chr 15 hotspot targets in NOD allele swap mESCs were also concordant with predictions from eQTL mapping (Figure 4G; p = 0.0012), although with weaker concordance compared to 129S1 lines. A predicted transcription factor binding site (Lesurf et al., 2016Lesurf R. Cotto K.C. Wang G. Griffith M. Kasaian K. Jones S.J.M. Montgomery S.B. Griffith O.L.

Using chromatin immunoprecipitation and qPCR, we confirmed that NR5A2 binds to the identified Lifr enhancer (Figure 4H). In support of the role of NR5A2 in activating Lifr expression, sequences carrying either naturally occurring allele drove the reporter gene expression higher than the alleles lacking the NR5A2 binding site (Figure 4I), suggesting that NR5A2 directly activates the expression of Lifr. We leveraged natural genetic variation and unbiased genetic mapping to reconstruct a complete causal molecular chain linking the hallmarks of pluripotency to a single variant that influences the binding affinity of NR5A2, alters Lifr expression, and leads to downstream changes in a suite of genes that affect pluripotency. Genetic background strongly influences molecular phenotypes in ESCs and can be harnessed to discover the drivers of differences in ESC biology.

Specifically, protracted inflammation after acute injury has been associated with decreased bone fracture healing and increased rates of nonunion in elderly patients. Here, we investigated the efficacy of using Maresin 1 (MaR1), an omega-3 fatty acid-derived pro-resolving agent, to resolve inflammation after tibial fracture injury and subsequently improving aged bone healing. Aged (24-month-old mice) underwent tibial fracture surgery and were either treated with vehicle or MaR1 3 days after injury. Fracture calluses were harvested 7 days, 14 days, 21 days, and 28 days after injury to investigate inflammatory response, cartilage development, bone deposition, and mechanical integrity, respectively. Healing bones from MaR1-treated mice displayed decreased cartilage formation and increased bone deposition which resulted in increased structural stiffness and increased force to fracture in the later stages of repair. In the early stages, MaR1 treatment decreased the number of pro-inflammatory macrophages within the fracture callus and decreased the level of inflammatory biomarkers in circulation. In tissue culture models, MaR1 treatment of bone marrow-derived macrophages from aged mice protected cells form a pro-inflammatory phenotype and induced an anti-inflammatory fate. Furthermore, the secretome of MaR1-treated bone marrow-derived macrophages was identified as osteoinductive, enhancing osteoblast differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells. Our findings here identify resolution of inflammation, and MaR1 itself, to be a point of intervention to improve aged bone healing."
https://openalex.org/W3100351242,"The superconductivity of high transition temperature (Tc) occurs in copper oxides with carrier-doping to an antiferromagnetic (AF) Mott insulator. This discovery more than thirty years ago immediately led to a prediction about the formation of a small Fermi pocket. This structure, however, has not yet been detected, while it could be a key element in relating high-Tc superconductivity to Mott physics. To address this long-standing issue, we investigate the electronic structure of a five-layered Ba2Ca4Cu5O10(F,O)2 with inner CuO2 planes demonstrated to be cleanest ever in cuprates. Most surprisingly, we find small Fermi surface (FS) pockets closed around (pi/2,pi/2) consistently by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and quantum oscillation measurements. The d-wave superconducting gap opens along the pocket, revealing the coexistence between the superconductivity and AF order in the same CuO2 sheet. Our data further indicate that the superconductivity can occur without contribution from the states near the antinodal region, which are shared by other competing excitations such as the charge density wave (CDW) and pseudogap states. This will have significant implications for understanding the superconductivity and puzzling Fermi arc phenomena in cuprates."
https://openalex.org/W3048791277,"Replication protein A (RPA), a major eukaryotic ssDNA-binding protein, is essential for all metabolic processes that involve ssDNA, including DNA replication, repair, and damage signaling. To perform its functions, RPA binds ssDNA tightly. In contrast, it was presumed that RPA binds RNA weakly. However, recent data suggest that RPA may play a role in RNA metabolism. RPA stimulates RNA-templated DNA repair in vitro and associates in vivo with R-loops, the three-stranded structures consisting of an RNA-DNA hybrid and the displaced ssDNA strand. R-loops are common in the genomes of pro- and eukaryotes, including humans, and may play an important role in transcription-coupled homologous recombination and DNA replication restart. However, the mechanism of R-loop formation remains unknown. Here, we investigated the RNA-binding properties of human RPA and its possible role in R-loop formation. Using gel-retardation and RNA/DNA competition assays, we found that RPA binds RNA with an unexpectedly high affinity (KD ≈ 100 pm). Furthermore, RPA, by forming a complex with RNA, can promote R-loop formation with homologous dsDNA. In reconstitution experiments, we showed that human DNA polymerases can utilize RPA-generated R-loops for initiation of DNA synthesis, mimicking the process of replication restart in vivo These results demonstrate that RPA binds RNA with high affinity, supporting the role of this protein in RNA metabolism and suggesting a mechanism of genome maintenance that depends on RPA-mediated DNA replication restart."

Pre- and postoperative photographs of 66 patients were analysed subjectively and objectively. Subjective evaluation was based questionnaires. Objective evaluation included measurement of pupil centration and iris colour analysis. Averaged hues from iris areas were transferred to numerical values using the LAB-colour-system. Single parameters and overall difference value (ΔE) were compared between AI and remaining iris (RI), as well as AI and fellow eye iris (FI). Patients, eye doctors and laymen rated the overall aesthetic outcome with 8.9 ±1.4, 7.7 ±1.1 and 7.3 ±1.1 out of 10 points, respectively. Mean AI decentration was 0.35 ±0.24 mm. Better pupil centration correlated with a higher overall score for aesthetic outcome (p<0.05). The AI was on average 4.65 ±10 points brighter than RI and FI. Aniridia treatment using a custom-made artificial iris prosthesis offers a good aesthetic outcome. Pupil centration was a key factor that correlated with the amount of aesthetic satisfaction.

https://openalex.org/W3049378075,"Objective The ALS Functional Rating Scale–Revised (ALSFRS-R) is the most commonly utilized instrument to index bulbar function in both clinical and research settings. We therefore aimed to evaluate the diagnostic utility of the ALSFRS-R bulbar subscale and swallowing item to detect radiographically confirmed impairments in swallowing safety (penetration or aspiration) and global pharyngeal swallowing function in individuals with ALS. Methods Two-hundred and one individuals with ALS completed the ALSFRS-R and the gold standard videofluoroscopic swallowing exam (VFSE). Validated outcomes including the Penetration-Aspiration Scale (PAS) and Dynamic Imaging Grade of Swallowing Toxicity (DIGEST) were assessed in duplicate by independent and blinded raters. Receiver operator characteristic curve analyses were performed to assess accuracy of the ALSFRS-R bulbar subscale and swallowing item to detect radiographically confirmed unsafe swallowing (PAS > 3) and global pharyngeal dysphagia (DIGEST >1). Results Although below acceptable screening tool criterion, a score of ≤ 3 on the ALSFRS-R swallowing item optimized classification accuracy to detect global pharyngeal dysphagia (sensitivity: 68%, specificity: 64%, AUC: 0.68) and penetration/aspiration (sensitivity: 79%, specificity: 60%, AUC: 0.72). Depending on score selection, sensitivity and specificity of the ALSFRS-R bulbar subscale ranged between 34–94%. A score of < 9 optimized classification accuracy to detect global pharyngeal dysphagia (sensitivity: 68%, specificity: 68%, AUC: 0.76) and unsafe swallowing (sensitivity:78%, specificity:62%, AUC: 0.73). Conclusions The ALSFRS-R bulbar subscale or swallowing item did not demonstrate adequate diagnostic accuracy to detect radiographically confirmed swallowing impairment. These results suggest the need for alternate screens for dysphagia in ALS."

https://openalex.org/W3048665493,"Surface-exposed Toll-like receptors (TLRs) such as TLR2 and TLR4 survey the extracellular environment for pathogens. TLR activation initiates the production of various cytokines and chemokines, including type I interferons (IFN-I). Downstream of TLR4, IFNβ secretion is only vigorously triggered in macrophages when the receptor undergoes endocytosis and switches signaling adaptor; surface TLR4 engagement predominantly induces proinflammatory cytokines via the signaling adaptor MyD88. It is unclear whether this dichotomy is generally applicable to other TLRs, cell types, or differentiation states. Here, we report that diverse TLR2 ligands induce an IFN-I response in human monocyte-like cells, but not in differentiated macrophages. This TLR2-dependent IFN-I signaling originates from the cell surface and depends on MyD88; it involves combined activation of the transcription factors IRF3 and NF-κB, driven by the kinases TBK1 and TAK1-IKKβ, respectively. TLR2-stimulated monocytes produced modest IFNβ levels that caused productive downstream signaling, reflected by STAT1 phosphorylation and expression of numerous interferon-stimulated genes. Our findings reveal that the outcome of TLR2 signaling includes an IFN-I response in human monocytes, which is lost upon macrophage differentiation, and differs mechanistically from IFN-I-induction through TLR4. These findings point to molecular mechanisms tailored to the differentiation state of a cell and the nature of receptors activated to control and limit TLR-triggered IFN-I responses."
https://openalex.org/W3048586480,"Resistin is a cysteine-rich adipokine that promotes the release of inflammatory cytokines, particularly interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), which are critical pro-inflammatory mediators in osteoarthritis (OA) pathogenesis. We describe evidence of significantly higher levels of resistin, IL-1β, and TNF-α expression in OA knee synovial tissue compared with that from non-OA knees. Resistin-induced enhancement of IL-1β and TNF-α expression in human OA synovial fibroblasts (OASFs) were attenuated by MEK and ERK inhibitors, as well as their respective siRNAs. Our data reveal that resistin enhances the expression of TNF-α and IL-1β in OASFs by inhibiting miR-149 expression via MEK and ERK signaling. Our findings elucidate the inter-relationships between resistin and pro-inflammatory mediators during OA pathogenesis and could help to facilitate the development of synovium-targeted therapy in OA."
https://openalex.org/W3049395143,"Due to substantial population decline, the Korean orchid P. scolopendrifolia is considered endangered and highly threatened. Like many endangered species, it is vulnerable to biological and anthropogenic threats that can lead to the loss of genetic diversity and, ultimately, extinction. Therefore, the assessment of genetic diversity and population genetic structure is imperative for conservation. In this study, we newly developed 15 polymorphic microsatellite markers. Analyses of genetic diversity and population genetic structure that included 182 samples from 11 populations were conducted using microsatellite markers and four noncoding regions of chloroplast DNA. Our study revealed a relatively low level of genetic diversity (Ho = 0.529, He = 0.356), albeit harboring with private alleles based on microsatellite genotyping data, and high haplotype diversities based on chloroplast DNA sequences data. The results of STRUCTURE and PCoA based on microsatellite genotyping data showed population differentiations. An AMOVA based on chloroplast DNA sequence data further corroborated these conclusions, indicating about 70% of variations found among populations. Low genetic diversity and divergence among the population might have been caused by factors, such as asexual reproduction, demographic events (bottleneck and population expansion), geographic isolation, and low gene flow. The development and implication of conservation strategies and management of P. scolopendrifolia are proposed based on these results."
https://openalex.org/W3048789188,"Abstract BRAF V600E confers poor prognosis and is associated with a distinct subtype of colorectal cancer (CRC). Little is known, however, about the genetic events driving the initiation and progression of BRAF V600E mutant CRCs. Recent genetic analyses of CRCs indicate that BRAF V600E often coexists with alterations in the WNT- and p53 pathways, but their cooperation remains ill-defined. Therefore, we systematically compared small and large intestinal organoids from mice harboring conditional Braf floxV600E , Trp53 LSL-R172H , and/or Apc flox/flox alleles. Using these isogenic models, we observe tissue-specific differences toward sudden BRAF V600E expression, which can be attributed to different ERK-pathway ground states in small and large intestinal crypts. BRAF V600E alone causes transient proliferation and suppresses epithelial organization, followed by organoid disintegration. Moreover, BRAF V600E induces a fetal-like dedifferentiation transcriptional program in colonic organoids, which resembles human BRAF V600E -driven CRC. Co-expression of p53 R172H delays organoid disintegration, confers anchorage-independent growth, and induces invasive properties. Interestingly, p53 R172H cooperates with BRAF V600E to modulate the abundance of transcripts linked to carcinogenesis, in particular within colonic organoids. Remarkably, WNT-pathway activation by Apc deletion fully protects organoids against BRAF V600E -induced disintegration and confers growth/niche factor independence. Still, Apc- deficient BRAF V600E -mutant organoids remain sensitive toward the MEK inhibitor trametinib, albeit p53 R172H confers partial resistance against this clinically relevant compound. In summary, our systematic comparison of the response of small and large intestinal organoids to oncogenic alterations suggests colonic organoids to be better suited to model the human situation. In addition, our work on BRAF-, p53-, and WNT-pathway mutations provides new insights into their cooperation and for the design of targeted therapies."
https://openalex.org/W3048979007,"We have previously described a novel temporal encoding mechanism in the somatosensory system, where mechanical pulses grouped into periodic bursts create a perceived tactile frequency based on the duration of the silent gap between bursts, rather than the mean rate or the periodicity. This coding strategy may offer new opportunities for transmitting information to the brain using various sensory neural prostheses and haptic interfaces. However, it was not known whether the same coding mechanisms apply when using electrical stimulation, which recruits a different spectrum of afferents. Here, we demonstrate that the predictions of the burst gap coding model for frequency perception apply to burst stimuli delivered with electrical pulses, re-emphasising the importance of the temporal structure of spike patterns in neural processing and perception of tactile stimuli. Reciprocally, the electrical stimulation data confirm that the results observed with mechanical stimulation do indeed depend on neural processing mechanisms in the central nervous system, and are not due to skin mechanical factors and resulting patterns of afferent activation."
https://openalex.org/W3049746328,"Anthropogenic activities in catchments used for drinking water production largely contaminates source waters, and this may impact the quality of the final drinking water product. These contaminants may also affect taxonomic and functional profiles of the bacterial communities in the drinking water. Here, we report an integrated insight into the microbiome and water quality of four water treatment plants (NWC, NWE, WCA and NWG) that supply portable water to communities in South Africa. A new scoring system based on combined significant changes of physicochemical parameters and microbial abundance from raw to treated water was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment plants at water purification. Physicochemical parameters which include total soluble solids, turbidity, pH, nitrites and phosphorus among others, were measured in source, treated, and distributed water. There were general statistically significant (P ≤ 0.05) differences between raw and treated water, demonstrating the effectiveness of the purification process. Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene was used for taxonomic profiling of the microbial communities and this data was used to infer functional attributes of the communities. Structure and composition of the bacterial communities differed significantly (P < 0.05) among the treatment plants, only NWE and NWG showed no significant differences (P > 0.05), this correlated with the predicted functional profile of the microbial communities obtained from Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Observed States (PICRUSt), as well as the likely pollutants of source water. Bacteroidetes, Chlorobi and Fibrobacteres significantly differed (P < 0.05) between raw and distributed water. PICRUSt inferred a number of pathways involved in the degradation of xenobiotics such as Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, atrazine and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. More worryingly, was the presence of pathways involved in beta-lactam resistance, potential pathogenic Escherichia coli infection, Vibrio cholerae infection, and Shigellosis. Also present in drinking and treated water were OTUs associated with a number of opportunistic pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W3049248537,"Elastic fibers containing elastin play an important role in tendon functionality, but the knowledge on presence and function of elastin during tendon healing is limited. The aim of this study was to investigate elastin content and distribution in intact and healing Achilles tendons and to understand how elastin influence the viscoelastic properties of tendons. The right Achilles tendon was completely transected in 81 Sprague-Dawley rats. Elastin content was quantified in intact and healing tendons (7, 14, and 28 days post-surgery) and elastin distribution was visualized by immunohistochemistry at 14 days post-surgery. Degradation of elastin by elastase incubation was used to study the role of elastin on viscoelastic properties. Mechanical testing was either performed as a cyclic test (20× 10 N) or as a creep test. We found significantly higher levels of elastin in healing tendons at all time-points compared to intact tendons (4% in healing tendons 28 days post-surgery vs 2% in intact tendons). The elastin was more widely distributed throughout the extracellular matrix in the healing tendons in contrast to the intact tendon where the distribution was not so pronounced. Elastase incubation reduced the elastin levels by approximately 30% and led to a 40%-50% reduction in creep. This reduction was seen in both intact and healing tendons. Our results show that healing tendons contain more elastin and is more compliable than intact tendons. The role of elastin in tendon healing and tissue compliance indicates a protective role of elastic fibers to prevent re-injuries during early tendon healing. Plain Language Summary Tendons transfer high loads from muscles to bones during locomotion. They are primarily made by the protein collagen, a protein that provide strength to the tissues. Besides collagen, tendons also contain other building blocks such as, for example, elastic fibers. Elastic fibers contain elastin and elastin is important for the extensibility of the tendon. When a tendon is injured and ruptured the tissue heals through scar formation. This scar tissue is different from a normal intact tendon and it is important to understand how the tendons heal. Little is known about the presence and function of elastin during healing of tendon injuries. We have shown, in animal experiments, that healing tendons have higher amounts of elastin compared to intact tendons. The elastin is also spread throughout the tissue. When we reduced the levels of this protein, we discovered altered mechanical properties of the tendon. The healing tendon can normally extend quite a lot, but after elastin removal this extensibility was less obvious. The ability of the healing tissue to extend is probably important to protect the tendon from re-injuries during the first months after rupture. We therefore propose that the tendons heal with a large amount of elastin to prevent re-ruptures during early locomotion."
https://openalex.org/W3049518094,"Objective As native cartilage consists of different phenotypical zones, this study aims to fabricate different types of neocartilage constructs from collagen hydrogels and human mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) genetically modified to express different chondrogenic factors. Design Human MSCs derived from bone-marrow of osteoarthritis (OA) hips were genetically modified using adenoviral vectors encoding sex-determining region Y-type high-mobility-group-box (SOX) 9, transforming growth factor beta (TGFB) 1 or bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 2 cDNA, placed in type I collagen hydrogels and maintained in serum-free chondrogenic media for three weeks. Control constructs contained unmodified MSCs or MSCs expressing GFP. The respective constructs were analyzed histologically, immunohistochemically, biochemically, and by qRT-PCR for chondrogenesis and hypertrophy. Results Chondrogenesis in MSCs was consistently and strongly induced in collagen I hydrogels by the transgenes SOX9, TGFB1 and BMP2 as evidenced by positive staining for proteoglycans, chondroitin-4-sulfate (CS4) and collagen (COL) type II, increased levels of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) synthesis, and expression of mRNAs associated with chondrogenesis. The control groups were entirely non-chondrogenic. The levels of hypertrophy, as judged by expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and COL X on both the protein and mRNA levels revealed different stages of hypertrophy within the chondrogenic groups (BMP2>TGFB1>SOX9). Conclusions Different types of neocartilage with varying levels of hypertrophy could be generated from human MSCs in collagen hydrogels by transfer of genes encoding the chondrogenic factors SOX9, TGFB1 and BMP2. This technology may be harnessed for regeneration of specific zones of native cartilage upon damage."
https://openalex.org/W3048987312,"Preeclampsia, especially early-onset severe preeclampsia is one of the leading causes of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Although it has been well known that the pathophysiology of early-onset severe preeclampsia begins with abnormal placentation and aberrant activation of TGF-β signaling inhibits trophoblast cell invasion, the mechanisms underlying dysregulation of TGF-β signaling in early-onset severe preeclampsia remain elusive to date. Here, we revealed that induction of TGFBR1/TGF-β signaling mediated by DNMT3A downregulation plays a critical role in early-onset severe preeclampsia. Our results show that DNMT3A downregulation elevates TGFBR1 expression in trophoblast cells. Moreover, inhibition of TGFBR1 and TGF-β/Smad signaling can rescue the deficiencies of trophoblast cell migration and invasion caused by DNMT3A knockdown. Mechanistically, DNMT3A suppresses the transcription of TGFBR1 through recruiting EZH2 to its promoter but not changing DNA methylation of TGFBR1 promoter. In human samples, we detected lowly expressed DNMT3A, highly expressed TGFBR1 and hyperactivation of TGF-β/Smad signaling in decidua-embedded extravillous trophoblasts in early-onset severe preeclampsia, which provides the clinical evidence for the correlation between DNMT3A and TGFBR1. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that DNA methylation-independent induction of TGFBR1 mediated by DNMT3A downregulation is relevant to the development of early-onset severe preeclampsia."
https://openalex.org/W3049621735,"We established that Endosidin2 (ES2) affected the trafficking routes of both newly synthesized and endocytic pools of PIN-FORMED2 (PIN2) in Arabidopsis root epidermal cells. PIN2 populations accumulated in separated patches, which gradually merged into large and compact ES2 aggregates (ES2As). FM4-64 endocytic tracer labeled ES2As as well. Both PIN2 pools also appeared in vacuoles. Accelerated endocytosis of PIN2, its aggregation in the cytoplasm, and redirection of PIN2 flows to vacuoles led to a substantial reduction of the abundance of this protein in the plasma membrane. Whereas PIN-FORMED3 and PIN-FORMED4 also aggregated in the cytoplasm, SYT1 was not sensitive to ES2 treatment and did not appear either in the cytoplasmic aggregates or vacuoles. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that ES2 affects the Golgi apparatus so that stacks acquired cup-shape and even circular shape surrounded by several vesicles. Abnormally shaped Golgi stacks, stack remnants, multi-lamellar structures, separated Golgi cisterna rings, tubular structures, and vesicles formed discrete clusters."
https://openalex.org/W3049324940,"Purpose To evaluate the ability of re-test pattern electroretinogram (RE-PERG), a non-invasive and fast steady-state PERG, to detect inner retinal bioelectric function anomalies in patients with early-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Methods The study population consisted of 17 patients with AD-related mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 16 patients with vascular dementia (VD)-related MCI, both assessed using the neuropsychological Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and by structural magnetic resonance imaging, and 19 healthy, age-matched normal controls (NC). All participants were visually asymptomatic, had normal or near-normal general cognitive functioning and no or minimal impairments in daily life activities. Visual field (VF) test, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and RE-PERG, sampled in five consecutive blocks of 130 events, were performed. Results There was no statistically significant difference among the three groups with respect to age, VF parameters (mean and pattern standard deviations) and OCT parameters (ganglion cell complex thickness and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness). The mean amplitude in the RE-PERG was significantly lower, but only weakly in the AD group than in NC (p = 0.1) whereas the intrinsic variability of the 2nd harmonic phase was significantly higher in the AD group than in either the VD or NC group (p<0.001). Conclusions RE-PERG is altered in early-stage AD, showing a reduced amplitude with high intrinsic phase variability. It also allows the discrimination of AD from VD. A high intrinsic variability in the PERG signal, determined using RE-PERG, may thus be a new promising test for neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3049597270,"Background Nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) is a plant extract that has been shown to act as a free radical scavenger and pluripotent inhibitor of pro-inflammatory cytokines, two major cellular processes involved in the pathophysiology of sepsis. We investigated whether NDGA would improve markers of organ injury as well as survival in a rodent model of sepsis. Methods Abdominal sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and double puncture (CLP) in male Sprague-Dawley rats. NDGA was administered either at the time of injury (pre-) or 6 hours later (post-treatment). A sham surgery group and a vehicle only group were also followed as controls. Blood and lung tissue were collected 24 h after CLP. Lung tissue was used for histopathologic analysis and to measure pulmonary edema. Arterial oxygenation was measured directly to generate PaO2/FiO2, and markers of renal injury (blood urea nitrogen), liver injury (alanine aminotransferase), and tissue hypoxia (lactate) were measured. In a separate set of animals consisting of the same treatment groups, animals were followed for up to 36 hours for survival. Results NDGA pre-treatment resulted in improved oxygenation, less lung edema, lower lactate, lower BUN, and reduced histologic lung injury. NDGA post-treatment resulted in less lung edema, lower lactate, lower BUN, and less histologic lung injury, but did not significantly change oxygenation. None of the NDGA treatment groups statistically affected ALT or creatinine. NDGA pre-treatment showed improved survival compared with control CLP animals at 36 hours, while post-treatment did not. Conclusions NDGA represents a novel pleiotropic anti-inflammatory agent with potential clinical utility for modulation of organ injury secondary to sepsis."
https://openalex.org/W3049737382,"Aptamers are short single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), RNA or synthetic XNA molecules, which are used as a class of affinity binders recognizing target molecules with a very high affinity and specificity. The aim of this study was to generate and characterize ssDNA aptamers for the detection of Newcastle disease virus (NDV). These aptamers were selected using systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) in combination with quantitative high-throughput DNA sequencing. After three rounds of selections, a highly enriched ssDNA pool was sequenced, and the results were analyzed using FASTAptamer Toolkit. Sequencing reads were sorted by copy numbers and clustered into groups, according to their sequence homology. Top aptameric sequences were used to develop a sandwich enzymatic linked aptamer assay (ELAA) for rapid and sensitive detection of NDV in farm samples. The selected aptamers have an affinity within the nanomolar range, and a high specificity with no cross-reactivity towards other avian viruses. Following optimization of the sandwich ELAA method, the results demonstrated that both selected aptamers Apt_NDV01 and Apt_NDV03 with dissociation constant values of 31 nM and 78.1 nM, respectively, showed the highest specificity and affinity for NDV detection. The ELAA results were verified by quantitative real-time PCR, demonstrating strong concordance, and showing outstanding accuracy for detection of NDV in field sample. In summary, combination of SELEX with high-throughput DNA sequencing allowed rapid screening and selection of aptamers. The selected aptamers allowed recognition of NDV with high affinities. This is the first report that uses a validated sandwich ELAA for rapid and specific detection of NDV in poultry samples."

Since 2016, the European Union (EU) Tobacco Products Directive (TPD) specifies a minimum pack size of 20 cigarettes. We examined cigarette pack sizes in the EU and whether pack size composition differed between cheap and expensive price segments, as well as the impact of the revised TPD.We conducted a longitudinal analysis of pricing data from 23 EU countries between 2006-2017. We examined pack sizes over time to assess the impact of the TPD, differences in pack size composition between cheap and expensive price segments, and compared gaps in median prices between products using actual and 'expected' prices (price if all packs contained 20 sticks).Cigarette pack sizes changed over time, across the EU. The distribution of pack sizes varied between price segments, with small pack sizes especially frequent in the cheap segment of the cigarette market, but this varied over time and across countries. Packs of <20 cigarettes almost disappeared from the data samples after implementation of the TPD.Implementation of the TPD appears to have virtually eliminated packs with <20 cigarettes, restricting their use by the TI. Our analysis suggests pack sizes have been used differentially across the EU. Country-level analyses on the industry's use of pack sizes, consumer responses, and evaluations of restricting certain pack sizes are needed to confirm our findings and strengthen policy."

Although traditionally considered metabolic housekeeping enzymes because of their ability to detoxify reactive aldehydes, like those generated from lipid peroxidation damage, the contributions of these enzymes to other biological processes are widespread.

PtoDC3000 was shown to synthesize IAA using an uncharacterized pathway requiring indole-3-acetaldehyde dehydrogenase activity (21McClerklin S.A. Lee S.G. Harper C.P. Nwumeh R. Jez J.M. Kunkel B.N.

Previously, a mutation in Azospirilum brasilense (aldA) was identified that decreased IAA production and was linked to a gene and annotated as encoding an aldehyde dehydrogenase (30Xie B. Xu K.

Bioinformatic analysis of PtoDC3000 identified a set of aldehyde dehydrogenases (AldA–C) sharing 30–40% amino acid identity with each other. Subsequent metabolic, biochemical, and in planta analyses of AldA (UniProt: PSPTO_0092), AldB (UniProt: PSPTO_2673), and AldC (UniProt: PSPTO_3644) demonstrated that AldA functions as an indole-3-acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, is essential for IAA synthesis, and contributes to virulence of PtoDC3000 (21McClerklin S.A.

Indole-3-acetaldehyde dehydrogenase-dependent auxin synthesis contributes to virulence of Pseudomonas syringae strain DC 3000.PLoS Pathog. 2018; 14 (29293681): e100681110.1371/journal.ppat.1006811Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). AldB may also contribute to IAA synthesis but is not as metabolically or kinetically efficient as AldA for IAA production (21McClerklin S.A. Lee S.G. Harper C.P. Nwumeh R. Jez J.M. Kunkel B.N. Indole-3-acetaldehyde dehydrogenase-dependent auxin synthesis contributes to virulence of Pseudomonas syringae strain DC 3000.PLoS Pathog. 2018; 14 (29293681): e100681110.1371/journal.ppat.1006811Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Analysis of AldC indicates that it lacks a role in IAA synthesis (21McClerklin S.A. Lee S.G. Harper C.P. Nwumeh R. Jez J.M. Kunkel B.N. Indole-3-acetaldehyde dehydrogenase-dependent auxin synthesis contributes to virulence of Pseudomonas syringae strain DC 3000.PLoS Pathog. 2018; 14 (29293681): e100681110.1371/journal.ppat.1006811Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar); however, its potential biochemical role in PtoDC3000 was not fully examined. Here we investigate the substrate profile of AldC from PtoDC3000, which suggests that this enzyme functions as a long-chain aliphatic aldehyde dehydrogenase. The 2.5 Å resolution X-ray crystal of the AldC C291A mutant in complex with octanal and NAD+ and biochemical analysis of a set of site-directed mutants provide insight on substrate recognition in this enzyme. Comparison of the three-dimensional structures of AldA and AldC from PtoDC3000 reveals the sequence and structural changes that lead to distinct substrate profiles of these aldehyde dehydrogenases. Previously, three aldehyde dehydrogenases (AldA–C) from the plant pathogen P. syringae strain PtoDC3000 were identified and examined for their contribution to the synthesis of IAA and virulence (21McClerklin S.A. Lee S.G. Harper C.P. Nwumeh R. Jez J.M. Kunkel B.N.

Each protein was expressed and purified to homogeneity for enzyme assays using indole-3-acetaldehyde as a substrate (21McClerklin S.A. Lee S.G. Harper C.P. Nwumeh R. Jez J.M. Kunkel B.N. Indole-3-acetaldehyde dehydrogenase-dependent auxin synthesis contributes to virulence of Pseudomonas syringae strain DC 3000.PLoS Pathog. 2018; 14 (29293681): e100681110.1371/journal.ppat.1006811Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Unlike AldA and AldB, which functioned as physiological tetramers, AldC was shown to be a homodimer (21McClerklin S.A. Lee S.G. Harper C.P. Nwumeh R. Jez J.M. Kunkel B.N. Indole-3-acetaldehyde dehydrogenase-dependent auxin synthesis contributes to virulence of Pseudomonas syringae strain DC 3000.PLoS Pathog. 2018; 14 (29293681): e100681110.1371/journal.ppat.1006811Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Steady-state kinetic parameters for AldA using indole-3-acetaldehyde showed this enzyme to be 130- and 710-fold more efficient than AldB and AldC, respectively (21McClerklin S.A. Lee S.G. Harper C.P. Nwumeh R. Jez J.M. Kunkel B.N. Indole-3-acetaldehyde dehydrogenase-dependent auxin synthesis contributes to virulence of Pseudomonas syringae strain DC 3000.PLoS Pathog. 2018; 14 (29293681): e100681110.1371/journal.ppat.1006811Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Bioinformatic analysis predicted that AldC contains the PF00171 domain, a signature domain of the aldehyde dehydrogenase superfamily, ranging from Ser33 to Ile482 (Fig. 2A). Specifically, the 4 catalytic residues (Asn159, Glu257, Gly288, and Cys291) and 19 residues in the NAD+-binding site (Ile155–Asn159, Lys182, Gly219, Ile233–Ser236, Ala239, Leu242, Glu257, Leu258, Gly259, Cys291, Glu391, and Phe393) define the aldehyde dehydrogenase consensus sequence motifs of AldC. The NCBI Conserved Protein Domain Family server places AldC in the cd01738/ALDH_CddD_SSP0762 family, 1 of 42 aldehyde dehydrogenase families found in the Pseudomonas (31Sophos N.A. Vasiliou V. Aldehyde dehydrogenase gene superfamily: the 2002 update.Chem. Biol.

The Pseudomonas orthologous groups classification system in the Pseudomonas Genome Database (RRID:SCR_006590) found orthologs of AldC (group ID POG018413) from 93 Pseudomonas species and strains, including P. aeruginosa, P. putida, P. fluorescens, and P. savastanoi (Fig. 2B and Table S1). AldC belongs to a clade consisting of aldehyde dehydrogenases, which share ∼90% sequence identity, from various plant pathogenic Pseudomonas spp.: P. syringae, P. viridiflava, P. savastanoi, and P. amygdali in the P. syringae phylogenetic group. None of AldC-related enzymes from Pseudomonas had previously been experimentally characterized, and their substrates and functions had yet to be described. To determine the substrate preference of AldC, a panel of 23 molecules (Table S2), including short- to long-chain aliphatic aldehydes (acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, butyraldehyde, valeraldehyde (pentanal), isovaleraldehyde, 3-methylcrotonaldehyde, hexanal, trans-2-hexen-1-al, heptanal, octanal, nonanal, trans-2-nonenal), betaine aldehyde, and aromatic aldehydes (benzaldehyde, m-anisaldehyde, p-anisaldehyde, phenylacetaldehyde, cinnamaldehyde, hydrocinnamaldehyde, coniferylaldehyde, sinapaldehyde, 4-pyridinecarboxaldehyde, and indole-3-acetaldehyde) was used to screen for enzymatic activity. Spectrophotometric assays of AldC identified aliphatic aldehydes of 5–9-carbon length, as well as hydrocinnamaldehyde and 4-pyridinecarboxyaldehyde, as substrates (Fig. 3A) with octanal having the highest specific activity (Fig. 3B). These data suggest that short 2–4-carbon aldehydes, branched aliphatic aldehydes, and larger aromatic aldehydes are poor substrates for AldC. To evaluate the nicotinamide cofactor preference of AldC, the activity of the enzyme was tested with octanal and either NAD+ or NADP+, which showed a distinct preference for NAD+ (Fig. 3C). Steady-state kinetic analysis of AldC with valeraldehyde, hexanal, heptanal, octanal, and nonanal indicates that the 8-carbon substrate (i.e. octanal) is the preferred aliphatic aldehyde substrate (Table 1). Although the kcat values of AldC vary less than 3-fold between these substrates, the Km value for octanal is the lowest (1.2 mm) with that of valeraldehyde as the highest (48.8 mm). The overall effect is a marked difference in catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) between octanal and the other aliphatic substrates ranging from use of nonanal exhibiting a 10-fold reduction in kcat/Km to ∼80-fold less efficient use of the 5-carbon substrate valeraldehyde. Generally, the aromatic aldehyde substrates hydrocinnamaldehyde and indole-3-acetaldehyde were poorly used by AldC with catalytic efficiencies comparable with valeraldehyde and 4-pyridinecarboxaldehyde used with a kcat/Km value 6-fold lower than octanal (Table 1). Overall, the biochemical analysis of AldC suggests that this enzyme functions primarily as a long-chain aliphatic aldehyde dehydrogenase (Fig. 3D). Moreover, conservation of related homologs in 93 different Pseudomonas species and strains (Fig. 2B) indicates a likely conserved function across these organisms.Table 1Steady-state kinetic parameters of AldC with aldehyde substratesSubstrateKcatKmKcat/Kmmin−1mmm−1 s−1Valeraldehyde/pentanal34.3 ± 4.248.8 ± 17.112Hexanal22.9 ± 1.016.4 ± 2.323Heptanal22.1 ± 1.57.4 ± 2.049Octanal67.4 ± 1.41.2 ± 0.1924Nonanal27.7 ± 5.04.9 ± 2.394Hydrocinnamaldehyde16.8 ± 1.614.2 ± 3.1204-Pyridinecarboxaldehyde38.7 ± 1.94.4 ± 0.6147Indole-3-acetaldehydeaSteady-state kinetic parameters of AldC with indole-3-acetaldehyde were previously reported (21).3.6 ± 0.21.3 ± 0.314NAD+ (octanal)30.9 ± 0.40.5 ± 0.11,050a Steady-state kinetic parameters of AldC with indole-3-acetaldehyde were previously reported (21McClerklin S.A.

However, it is unknown if caffeine further increases power output entropy. To investigate the effects of caffeine effects on cycling time trial performance and motor output entropy (MOEn), nine cyclists (VO2MAX of 55 ± 6.1 mL.kg.-1min-1) performed a 4 km cycling time trial (TT4km) after caffeine and placebo ingestion in a counterbalanced order. Power output data were sampled at a 2 Hz frequency, thereafter entropy was estimated on a sliding-window fashion to generate a power output time series. A number of mixed models compared performance and motor output entropy between caffeine and placebo every 25% of the total TT4km distance. Caffeine ingestion improved power output by 8% (p = 0.003) and increased MOEn by 7% (p = 0.018). Cyclists adopted a U-shaped pacing strategy after caffeine ingestion. MOEn mirrored power output responses as an inverted U-shape MOEn during the time trial. Accordingly, a strong inverse correlation was observed between MOEn and power output responses over the last 25% of the TT4km (p < 0.001), regardless of the ingestion, likely reflecting the end spurt during this period (p = 0.016). Caffeine ingestion improved TT4km performance and motor output responses likely due to a greater power output entropy."
https://openalex.org/W3049744582,"Background Patients diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), who also consume prescription opioids, have a greater likelihood of morbidity and mortality. This study evaluated whether a primary care team, focused on chronic pain care management, could use a validated questionnaire (STOP-Bang) and motivational follow-up, to increase identification and treatment of OSA. Methods This study was a retrospective, dual arm, pre/post controlled study. Participants of this study included the complete chronic pain management sub group treated by this primary care team. Participants were ≥ 18 years old and prescribed daily opioids for treatment of chronic pain. All participants had a multifaceted, individualized, educational meeting that included completing a STOP-Bang questionnaire. Participants who received a score ≥ three were advised to follow up with their primary care physician. Participants were seen quarterly throughout the study. Results The primary outcome of this study was that 65% of participants with likely OSA were using CPAP for a minimum of 12 months (range of 12–25 months, 18-month average) post-intervention vs. 37% CPAP-use in the control group (12 months of observation), both groups were chronic opioid users with OSA. This was a 28% relative improvement (p = 0.0034). A secondary outcome was that 8.9% of non-prior CPAP users obtained CPAP post- intervention; a 56.7% pre-post improvement (p = 0.0064, x2 = 10.08 with 1 degree of freedom). Also, participants who were likely to have OSA (STOP-Bang score ≥ 3 or had a positive polysomnography (AHI >5 with comorbidities)) compared to those unlikely to have OSA (STOP-Bang score <3 or had a negative polysomnography (AHI <5)) in this study were more likely to be male, have a higher BMI, have hypertension, have cardiovascular disease and/or have diabetes (all types). Conclusion Team based care management for participants taking prescription opioids, where STOP-Bang questionnaires were completed, were associated with an increase in the identification and treatment of OSA."

In our previous study, we showed that JBPOS0101 attenuated the accumulation of Aβ as well as the deficits in learning and memory in the 5xFAD mouse model. Here, we tested the dose effect (70 or 35 mg/kg) of JBPOS0101 on the memory defect and pathological markers and further investigated the underlying mechanisms in 5xFAD mice. In the behavior tests, JBPOS0101 treatment ameliorated deficits in learning and memory. Moreover, JBPOS0101 attenuated Aβ accumulation and tau phosphorylation. The elevated phosphorylation levels of the active GSK3β form (GSK3β-y216) in 5xFAD, which are responsible for tau phosphorylation, decreased in the JBPOS0101-treated groups. Furthermore, the elevation of reactive astrocytes and microglia in 5xFAD mice was attenuated in JBPOS0101-treated groups. These data suggest that JBPOS0101 may be a new drug candidate to lessen amyloid- and tau-related pathology by regulating glial cells."
