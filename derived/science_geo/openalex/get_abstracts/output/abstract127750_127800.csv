https://openalex.org/W2025345914,"An adjuvant role for certain short bacterial immunostimulatory DNA sequences (ISSs) has recently been proposed on the basis of their ability to stimulate T helper-1 (Thl) responses in gene-vaccinated animals. We report here that noncoding, ISS-enriched plasmid DMAs or ISS oligonucleotides (ISS-ODNs) potently stimulate immune responses to coadministered antigens. The ISS-DNAs suppress IgE synthesis, but promote IgC and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) production. They furthermore initiate the production of IFN-γ, IFN-α, IFN-β, and interleukins 12 and 18, all of which foster Thl responses and enhance cell-mediated immunity. Consideration should be given to adding noncoding DNA adjuvants to inactivated or subunit viral vaccines that, by themselves, provide only partial protection from infection."

We examined the potential role of SR-BI in mediating cellular cholesterol efflux. In Chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with murine SR-BI, overexpression of SR-BI resulted in a 3–4-fold stimulation of initial cholesterol efflux rates. Efflux rates correlated with SR-BI expression in cells and HDL concentration in the medium. When incubated with synthetic cholesterol-free HDL, SR-BI-transfected cells showed ∼3-fold increases in initial rates of efflux compared with control cells, indicating that SR-BI expression enhances net cholesterol efflux mediated by discoidal HDL. In six different cell types, including cultured macrophages, the rate of efflux of cholesterol mediated by HDL or serum was well correlated with cellular SR-BI expression level. In addition, in situhybridization experiments revealed that SR-BI mRNA was expressed in the thickened intima of atheromatous aorta of apolipoprotein E knockout mice. Thus, SR-BI is an authentic HDL receptor mediating cellular cholesterol efflux. SR-BI may facilitate the initial steps of HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux in the arterial wall as well as later steps of reverse cholesterol transport involving uptake of HDL cholesterol in the liver.

The levels of plasma high density lipoproteins (HDL) 1The abbreviations used are: HDL, high density lipoprotein(s); apo, apolipoprotein; SR-BI, scavenger receptor type B class I; FC, free cholesterol; CE, cholesteryl ester; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PC, phosphatidylcholine; SM, sphingomyelin. are inversely related to the incidence of atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease (1Tall A.R.

Med. 1989; 321: 1311-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (1412) Google Scholar). The protective effect of HDL is thought to involve the reverse transport of cholesterol from cells in the arterial wall to the liver for disposal (3Eisenberg S. J.

The transfer of cholesterol from cells to HDL may result from aqueous diffusion (5Johnson W.J. Mahlberg F.H. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. Biochim. Biophys.

Recently a member of the scavenger receptor family, scavenger receptor type B class I (SR-BI), was shown to bind HDL with high affinity and to mediate the selective cellular uptake of HDL cholesteryl ester (CE) (8Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar). SR-BI is highly expressed in steroidogenic tissues and the liver (8Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M.

Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21001-21004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). While these results show that SR-BI is an HDL receptor that is likely to provide sterol for steroidogenesis, the exact role of SR-BI in the regulation of HDL metabolism and the maintenance of general cholesterol homeostasis is unknown. In the present study we used SR-BI-transfected cells to evaluate a possible role of SR-BI in HDL-mediated cellular cholesterol efflux. We also sought to establish a relationship between cholesterol efflux and the level of SR-BI expression in a variety of cell types. The results, together with our finding that SR-BI mRNA is expressed in the thickened intima of atheromatous aorta, suggest a potentially important role of SR-BI in the initial steps of cholesterol efflux in the arterial wall. The murine SR-BI cDNA (10Wang N. Weng W. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21001-21004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) was subcloned into a mammalian expression vector pRc/CMV (Invitrogen) and transfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells by electroporation. Stable transformants were selected with 0.8 mg/ml and maintained with 0.3 mg/ml of G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.), respectively, in Ham's F-12 medium containing penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 2 mm glutamine (medium A) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. This procedure yielded clones with moderate SR-BI overexpression (“low expression”). To obtain high expressing cells, the original G418-resistant pool was further screened with fluorescence-activated cell sorting using HDL labeled with 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyaninepercholate (Molecular Probes) (12Pitas R.E. Innerarity T.L. Weinstein J.N. Mahley R.W. Arteriosclerosis. 1981; 1: 177-185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells thus obtained (“high expression”) were used in all experiments except for phosphatidylcholine (PC) and sphingomyelin (SM) uptake experiments. Y1-BS1 cells were kindly provided by Dr. David L. Williams (State University of New York). Human plasma HDL was prepared by sequential ultracentrifugation. Cholesterol-free reconstituted HDL was prepared with the sodium cholate method from purified human apolipoprotein (apo) A-I and egg yolk PC (13Jonas A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 553-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The initial molar ratio of PC:apoA-I:sodium cholate was 80:1:80, and sodium cholate was removed by exhaustive dialysis. Cell monolayers were labeled with either [7-3H]cholesterol or [1,2-3H]cholesterol by the addition of the labeled cholesterol to serum containing medium (14Rothblat G.H. Bamberger M. Phillips M.C. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 129: 628-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 15de la Llera Moya M. Atger V. Paul J.L. Fournier N. Moatti N. Giral P. Friday K.E. Rothblat G.H. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1056-1065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following a 48-h labeling, cells were incubated for 24 h in the medium containing fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. Cellular cholesterol efflux was determined by measuring radioactivity released from cells into the medium upon the addition of acceptors (14Rothblat G.H. Bamberger M. Phillips M.C. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 129: 628-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 15de la Llera Moya M. Atger V. Paul J.L. Fournier N. Moatti N. Giral P. Friday K.E. Rothblat G.H. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1056-1065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the studies shown in Fig. 4, the labeling of cells was conducted in the presence of Sandoz 58035, an inhibitor of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (16Ross A.C. Go K.J. Heider J.G. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 815-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the apparent rate constant for efflux was calculated as described previously (17Yancey P.G. Rodrigueza W.V. Kilsdonk E.P.C. Stoudt G.W. Johnson W.J. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16026-16034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Lipid was extracted from culture medium by the method of Bligh and Dyer (18Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar) or from cells with hexane:isopropanol (3:2, v/v). Free cholesterol (FC) and CE were separated by thin layer chromatography and quantified by scintillation counting. Cellular cholesterol content was determined enzymatically (10Wang N. Weng W. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21001-21004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). For lipid uptake experiments, HDL was dual-labeled with [4-14C]FC and [cholesteryl-1,2,6,7-3H]cholesteryl oleate (19Morton R.E. Zilversmit D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11992-11995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) orl-α-1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-[oleoyl-1-14C]PC and [N-palmitoyl-9,10-3H]SM (prepared from [9,10-3H]palmitic acid) (20Schissel S.L. Tweedie-Hardman J. Rapp J.H. Graham G. Williams K.J. Tabas I. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1455-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). After incubation with labeled HDL, cells were washed with medium A containing 0.5% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, and cell-associated radioactivity was measured. Cells were homogenized in the presence of protease inhibitors (0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mmEDTA). Cell membrane protein was collected by ultracentrifugation and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Immunoblotting was performed using anti-SR-BI antiserum (10Wang N. Weng W. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21001-21004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Corp.). RNase protection analysis was carried out as described previously (10Wang N. Weng W. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21001-21004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The expression levels of SR-BI mRNA and protein were determined by densitometric quantitation of radiographic and chemiluminescence images, respectively. The cRNA probes for in situ hybridization were produced by in vitro transcription from a 290-base pair murine SR-BI cDNA encoding amino acids 315–412 and labeled with digoxigenin 11-UTP (Boehringer Mannheim). Nonisotopic in situ hybridization and hematoxylin counterstaining were performed as described previously (21Wang N. Tabas I. Winchester R. Ravalli S. Rabbani L.E. Tall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8837-8842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The frozen tissue sections were probed with sense or antisense riboprobe at 10 ng/ml. Anti-digoxigenin antibody and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody were used to detect the hybridized riboprobes. A monoclonal antibody against murine MAC-3 (PharMingen) was biotinylated and used for immunohistochemistry (21Wang N. Tabas I. Winchester R. Ravalli S. Rabbani L.E. Tall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8837-8842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). To evaluate a potential role of SR-BI in HDL-dependent cholesterol efflux, we stably transfected CHO cells with the murine SR-BI cDNA (10Wang N. Weng W. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21001-21004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Compared with control CHO cells, incubation of SR-BI-expressing cells with HDL resulted in a marked 3–4-fold stimulation of initial cholesterol efflux rate; this effect was completely dependent on the presence of HDL in the medium (Fig. 1 A). Over a range of HDL concentrations from 75 to 300 μg/ml, SR-BI expression resulted in a 4–5-fold stimulation of the initial rate of HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux from cells (Fig. 1 B). The cellular cholesterol efflux mediated by HDL correlated with the expression level of SR-BI in cell membranes (Fig. 1 C). CHO cells with a relatively low level of SR-BI overexpression displayed a 1.5-fold increase in cholesterol efflux, while CHO cells with high expression of SR-BI exhibited a 3-fold increase in cholesterol efflux. Western blots of cellular membranes showed that SR-BI was present in control CHO cells; low expression transfected cells had ∼2-fold higher expression than control while high expression cells had ∼10-fold higher expression (Fig. 2).Figure 2Immunoblot analysis of SR-BI expression in different murine cell types. Membrane proteins (50 μg) were separated on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted with anti-SR-BI anti-serum.

Using HDL containing radiolabeled PC and SM, we observed that SR-BI overexpression resulted in ∼2–3-fold stimulation of initial lipid cellular uptake, respectively. Together the data in Figs. 1 and 3 A indicate that SR-BI stimulates the bi-directional exchange of FC between spherical plasma HDL and cells. To determine if SR-BI is capable of mediating net cholesterol efflux from cells, we used synthetic cholesterol-free HDL (13Jonas A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 553-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) as a cholesterol acceptor in the medium (14Rothblat G.H. Bamberger M. Phillips M.C. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 129: 628-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar,22Jonas A. Bottum K. Theret N. Duchateau P. Castro G. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 860-870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These discoidal particles resemble nascent HDL formed in the blood stream as a by-product of lipolysis, remodeling, or secretion (3Eisenberg S. J. Lipid Res. 1984; 25: 1017-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar,23Tall A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 235-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). When incubated with discoidal HDL, SR-BI-transfected cells exhibited an ∼3-fold increase in initial rates of cholesterol efflux compared with control cells (Fig. 3 B). Since in this case cholesterol-free acceptor was added to the medium, this experiment indicated a marked stimulation of net cholesterol efflux as a result of HDL-SR-BI interaction. In contrast to these findings, SR-BI-expressing CHO cells showed no increase in efflux of cellular cholesterol mediated by free apoA-I (over a range of 2–8 μg/ml) (24Bielicki J.K. Johnson W.J. Weinberg R.B. Glick J.M. Rothblat G.H. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1699-1709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Mendez A.J. Anantharamaiah G.M. Segrest J.P. Oram J.F. J. Clin.

Rothblat G.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7955-7965Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), suggesting that SR-BI is not responsible for the efflux of cellular cholesterol mediated by free apolipoproteins (7Oram J.F. Yokoyama S. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2473-2491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Even though SR-BI stimulated cellular uptake of both HDL-free and esterified cholesterol, efflux of cellular cholesterol was limited to free sterol. Thus, in an experiment similar to Fig. 1 A, almost all (>99%) of the cholesterol transported to the medium was found to be in the unesterified form even though ∼65% of cellular [3H]cholesterol was found to be esterified. When the cellular acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase activity was abolished by Sandoz 58035 during cholesterol labeling, similar effects of SR-BI on the HDL-mediated [3H]cholesterol efflux to that shown in Fig. 1 A were subsequently observed (data not shown). These data indicate that SR-BI stimulates the efflux of FC but not CE from cells. Thus, cellular CE stores appear to be in a compartment not directly accessible to SR-BI. To explore the physiological significance of the SR-BI-mediated cholesterol efflux, we examined the expression level of SR-BI in a variety of murine cell types and then correlated expression levels with the rate of HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux. SR-BI expression varied greatly from well above that of murine liver (Fu5AH cells) to almost undetectable (Y1 cells) (Fig. 2). SR-BI was expressed in several types of macrophages as well as control CHO cells (Fig. 2). The abundance of SR-BI mRNA in these cells was determined by RNase protection assay and was found to be highly correlated with protein expression levels (r = 0.99, p = 0.0001) except for Fu5AH cells, which had disproportionately high protein expression. The ability of HDL and serum to stimulate cholesterol efflux in different types of cells was correlated with their expression level of SR-BI (Fig. 4). The rate of efflux to HDL was determined at three different concentrations for each of the cell types shown. The rate of efflux per microgram of HDL/ml was well correlated with the expression level of SR-BI in cellular membranes (A, note that the x axis is a log scale). The rate constant for efflux to 5% human serum was also correlated with SR-BI expression level (B). In contrast, there was no correlation between SR-BI expression and efflux to cyclodextrins, synthetic cage-like molecules that markedly stimulate cholesterol efflux (17Yancey P.G. Rodrigueza W.V. Kilsdonk E.P.C. Stoudt G.W. Johnson W.J. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16026-16034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 27Atger V.M. de la Llera Moya M. Stoudt G.W. Rodrigueza W.V. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 773-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) (not shown). The response of J774 macrophages and control CHO cells was in the intermediate region but appeared to be greater than cells with very low SR-BI expression (Fig. 4). The CE laden foam cells in atheromatous lesions arise from macrophages or smooth muscle cells (28Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (10004) Google Scholar). To evaluate possible expression of SR-BI in atheroma, in situ hybridization experiments were carried out on complex atheromatous lesions from apoE knockout mice (29Plump A.S. Smith J.D. Hayek T. Aalto-Setala K. Walsh A. Verstuyft J. Rubin E. Breslow J. Cell. 1992; 71: 343-353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1878) Google Scholar, 30Zhang S.H. Reddick R.L. Piedrahita J. Maeda N. Science. 1992; 258: 468-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1849) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5 A, hematoxylin stain). This revealed a strong signal with an antisense probe (Fig. 5 C) not seen with the sense strand control (Fig. 5 B). The signal was present throughout the foam cell-containing region of thickened intima (I, Fig. 5 C) and was strong in the cellular layer immediately beneath the endothelial surface of the vessel; however, the signal was weak in the arterial media (M, Fig. 5 C). A monoclonal antibody against MAC-3, a macrophage surface marker, gave a signal in the same region as the SR-BI mRNA signal (not shown). These observations demonstrate that SR-BI mRNA is expressed in atheromatous lesions, probably in macrophages foam cells. In this study we showed that SR-BI overexpression markedly stimulated HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux in CHO cells. This appears to be the first demonstration of an authentic HDL receptor mediating cellular cholesterol efflux. The good correlation of the rate of HDL-mediated efflux with SR-BI expression levels in six different cell types suggests a physiological role of SR-BI in mediating this process in a variety of cell types. Expression of SR-BI in the atheromatous lesions raises the possibility that HDL uses this receptor to promote cholesterol efflux from atheromatous arterial walls. Our results suggest that the HDL receptor, SR-BI, may play a critical role in reverse cholesterol transport, a pathway by which cholesterol is transported from peripheral cells to the liver (31Glomset J.A. J. Lipid Res. 1968; 9: 155-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Numerousin vitro studies have demonstrated that HDL can remove cholesterol from cells through either a process of aqueous diffusion (5Johnson W.J. Mahlberg F.H. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1085: 273-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 6Rothblat G.H. Mahlberg F.H. Johnson W.J. Phillips M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1091-1097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or as a result of the interaction of HDL with cell surface binding sites (7Oram J.F. Yokoyama S. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2473-2491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), depending on the cell types and other experimental conditions. Although a number of HDL-binding proteins have been described (5Johnson W.J. Mahlberg F.H. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1085: 273-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 7Oram J.F. Yokoyama S. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2473-2491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), their physiological role in reverse cholesterol transport is doubtful since none has been shown to be a functional HDL receptor that facilitates cholesterol efflux. Our results show that cellular cholesterol efflux is greatly enhanced by SR-BI overexpression and well correlated with SR-BI expression levels in different cells. This strongly suggests that SR-BI may have a physiological role in cellular cholesterol efflux, although our studies by no means preclude the probable role of other receptors or processes in HDL-mediated cellular cholesterol efflux. SR-BI has been shown to mediate the selective uptake of cholesteryl ester from HDL without taking up or degrading HDL protein (8Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar). This is important in steroidogenic tissues and liver, where SR-BI is highly expressed (8Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar, 9Acton S.L. Scherer P.E. Lodish H.F. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21003-21009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Wang N. Weng W. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Biol.

Invest. 1996; 98: 984-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Our studies indicate that SR-BI also promotes uptake of HDL FC and phospholipids, which may also be important in these tissues. Together these findings suggest that SR-BI may tether HDL at the cell surface and, depending on the gradient of chemical potential of a specific lipid between the cell surface and the acceptor, mediate either exchange or net transfer of lipid into or out of the cell. The physiological implication is that the net effect of HDL-SR-BI interaction on lipid movement will depend on HDL concentration and composition, SR-BI expression level, and cellular metabolism of sterols. It is thought that small, CE-poor pre-β HDL (similar to the discoidal HDL in Fig. 3 B) and other forms of phospholipid-rich HDL are the preferred acceptors of cellular cholesterol (5Johnson W.J. Mahlberg F.H. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1085: 273-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that such particles may use SR-BI as a receptor to mediate cholesterol efflux; the expression of SR-BI mRNA in atheromatous lesions of aorta suggests that optimal HDL particles may also mediate cholesterol efflux via SR-BI in the arterial wall. Although our SR-BI antibodies were found to be unsuitable for immunohistochemistry, the high correlation between cellular SR-BI mRNA and protein suggest that SR-BI protein would also be expressed in atheroma. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of hepatic SR-BI leads to decreased HDL and increased biliary cholesterol (32Kozarsky K.F. Donahee M.H. Rigotti A. Iqbal S.N. Edelman E.R. Krieger M. Nature. 1997; 387: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar), providing strong support for the notion that SR-BI may play a physiological role in promoting the transport of HDL FC and CE across the liver. Thus, SR-BI may be involved in the initial steps of removal of cholesterol from foam cells in the arterial wall, as well as the final stage of reverse cholesterol transport in the liver. We thank X.

In COS cells, it forms a Na+ channel that responds to a drop of the extracellular pH with both a rapidly inactivating and a sustained Na+ current. This biphasic kinetic closely resembles that of the H+-gated current described in sensory neurons of dorsal root ganglia (1). Both the abundance of this novel H+-gated Na+ channel subunit in sensory neurons and the kinetics of the channel suggest that it is part of the channel complex responsible for the sustained H+-activated cation current in sensory neurons that is thought to be important for the prolonged perception of pain that accompanies tissue acidosis (1, 2).

Many painful inflammatory and ischemic conditions are accompanied by a decrease of the extracellular pH (2Steen K.H. Reeh P.W. Anton F. Handwerker H.O. J.

H+-gated cation channels are present in sensory neurons (1Bevan S. Yeats J. J. Physiol. ( Lond .). 1991; 433: 145-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 4Krishtal O.A. Pidoplichko V.I.

We recently cloned a rapidly inactivating H+-gated cation channel ASIC 1The abbreviations used are: ASIC,acid-sensing ionchannel; DRASIC, dorsal root ganglia acid sensing ionchannel; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; DRG, dorsal root ganglia; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; DIG, digoxigenin.

Fast inactivating H+-gated cation currents were described in neurons of the central nervous system (6Akaike N. Ueno S. Prog.

Neurobiol. 1994; 43: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), tissues where ASIC is well expressed (7Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. Nature. 1997; 386: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar). However, rapidly inactivating H+-gated cation channels cannot account solely for the prolonged sensation of pain that accompanies tissue acidosis. Sensory neurons respond to a drop in pH with a rapidly inactivating followed by a sustained current, which is thought to mediate the non-adaptive pain caused by acids (1Bevan S. Yeats J. J. Physiol. ( Lond .). 1991; 433: 145-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Here we describe the cloning of a H+-gated cation channel specific for sensory neurons that has both a rapidly inactivating and a sustained component. We used an anchored PCR approach to identify the sequences upstream and downstream of the expressed sequence tag (W62694). An double stranded adapter (anchor) was prepared by annealing the oligonucleotides GATTTAGGTGACACTATAGAATCGAGGTCGACGGTATCCAGTCGACGAATTC and PO4-GAATTCGTCGACTG-NH2. The shorter oligonucleotide was protected with a 3′ NH2 group to avoid extension during the PCR reaction. This adapter was ligated to double stranded rat brain cDNA resulting in a cDNA with known sequences (the anchor) on both extremities. The so prepared anchored cDNA was used to amplify the 5′ and the 3′ end of the coding sequence by PCR. This was done using either the primer GATTTAGGTGACACTATAGAA or TAGAATCGAGGTCGACGGTATC, which are identical to parts of the longer of the two adapter oligonucleotides together with either the sense primer (CACTACACGCTATGCCAAGG, for amplification of the 3′ end) or the antisense primer (CCCAGCAACTCCGACACTTC, for amplification of the 5′ end) complementary to the expressed sequence tag (W62694). The PCR products were subcloned into Bluescript, and five clones each for the 5′ PCR and for the 3′ PCR were sequenced. The anchored PCR allowed us to identify the sequences upstream of the first ATG codon and downstream of the stop codon. However all clones isolated from brain contained introns with in frame stop codons and code for truncated proteins lacking the second transmembrane domain that was found to be essential for channel function (10Waldmann R. Champigny G. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11735-11737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Analysis of the tissue distribution showed that high levels of the mRNA are only found in DRG. Primers flanking the coding sequence (sense: ACGAATTCTCCCTGGTCCAGCCATGAAAC, antisense: CCTCGAGCTAGAGCCTTGTGACGAGGTAA) that contained an EcoRI site (sense) or an XhoI site (antisense) were used to amplify the full-length coding sequence from DRG cDNA. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and XhoI and subcloned into the EcoRI/SalI-digested PCI expression vector. One clone was sequenced on both strands, and two independent clones were sequenced on one strand using an Applied Biosystems sequencer. Unlike in brain, the three clones isolated from DRG code for full-length proteins. COS7 cells were co-transfected with DRASIC cDNA in the PCI expression vector and an expression vector containing the CD8 receptor cDNA using DEAE-dextran. 3 days later, cells binding CD8 antibody-coated beads (11Jurman M.E. Boland L.M. Yellen G. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 876-881PubMed Google Scholar) were used for experiments. Ion currents were recorded using either the whole cell or the patch-clamp technique. The pipette solution contained (in mm): KCl 120, NaCl 30, MgCl2 2, EGTA 5, HEPES 10 (pH 7.2). For the “0 sodium” solution NaCl was replaced by KCl. The bath solution contained in mm: NaCl 140, KCl 5, MgCl2 2, CaCl22, HEPES 10 (pH 7.3). Rapid changes in extracellular pH were induced by opening an outlet of a microperfusion system at a distance of ∼50 μm from the cell. Test solutions having a pH of less then 6 were buffered with 10 mm MES rather than HEPES. Experiments were carried out at room temperature (20–24 °C). 4 μg of total RNA from dorsal root ganglia of 7-day-old rats and 4 μg of poly(A+) RNA from adult rat brain were separated on a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel and subsequently transferred to nylon membranes. The blots were hybridized with a random prime32P-labeled fragment of the DRASIC cDNA corresponding to nucleotide 141–1145 in 6 × SSC, 10 × Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml herring sperm DNA, washed with 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 70 °C, and subsequently exposed to a Fuji phosphoimager screen. For the in situ hybridizations on frozen fixed 10-μm brain sections from adult Wistar rats, we used a33P-random prime-labeled fragment of DRASIC corresponding to nucleotide 141–1145. Brain sections from adult rats were hybridized with the 33P-end-labeled probes overnight at 37 °C in 50% formamide, 2 × SSC, and subsequently washed at room temperature in 1 × SSC. Sections (6 μm) and primary cultures of rat dorsal root ganglia were hybridized with double-stranded DNA fragments labeled by PCR with DIG-dUTP (sections), or fluorescein-12-dUTP (primary cultures). The probes used correspond to nucleotide 141–1145. Probe labeling, sample preparation, hybridization, and visualization of DIG nucleic acids with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-DIG antibodies was carried out following the protocols from Boehringer Mannheim. Primary cultures of DRG neurons from 4-day-old rats were prepared essentially as described (1Bevan S. Yeats J. J. Physiol. ( Lond .). 1991; 433: 145-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) and used for in situ hybridization after 7 days in culture. Thein situ hybridization results shown were confirmed with one additional probe. Sequence positions given refer to the sequence submitted to GenBank™. The sequence alignment was computed with the GCG (Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI) software package. All comparisons of sequences with data bases were done using the Blast network server at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Comparison of the ASIC protein sequence with the data base of expressed sequence tags identified one novel member of this family of ion channels. We used anchored PCR to clone the complete coding sequence from rat DRG. The DRASIC cDNA has an open reading frame of 1599 base pairs preceded by stop codons and codes for a protein of 533 amino acids. DRASIC belongs to the amiloride-sensitive Na+channel (12Canessa C.M.

A DRASIC transcript of ≈2.6 kilobases was detected in total RNA of DRG (Fig. 2 a). In brain poly(A+) RNA where ASIC mRNA is abundant (7Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. Nature. 1997; 386: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar), no DRASIC transcript was detectable. Furthermore a mouse multitissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) with poly(A+) RNA from brain, heart, spleen, lung, liver, skeletal muscle kidney, and testis did not give any signal (not shown) with the probe that labeled the DRASIC mRNA in total RNA from DRG, indicating that DRASIC is specific for sensory neurons. In situ hybridization confirmed those results (Fig. 2, b–d). DRASIC is expressed in DRG neurons and absent in brain. The small sensory neurons are thought to carry the nociceptive signals from polymodal sensory nerve endings and interestingly small neurons are intensely labeled. The specific expression in sensory neurons suggests that the DRASIC channel has properties required for a specific function of this type of neuron. Expression of DRASIC in COS cells induced a H+-gated cation channel with properties clearly distinct from those of ASIC (7Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. Nature. 1997; 386: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar). A rapid decrease of the extracellular pH from pH 7.4 to pH 4 induces a fast rising, rapidly inactivating current followed by a much slower activating sustained inward current (Fig. 3 a). Surprisingly, expression of DRASIC can induce both a rapidly and a slowly activating current. The kinetics of the DRASIC current very closely resemble the biphasic H+-gated cation current described in sensory neurons (1Bevan S. Yeats J. J. Physiol. ( Lond .). 1991; 433: 145-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Both the transient and the sustained DRASIC current reverse at +32 ± 3 mV (n = 5), which is close to the Na+equilibrium potential of +40 mV in the experimental conditions concerned (Fig. 3 b). This indicates that the two components are highly selective for Na+(gNa+/gK+ = 13.5). Unitary currents were recorded from outside-out patches in the absence of Na+ in the pipette (Fig. 3, c and d). The slope conductance of DRASIC is with 12.6 ± 0.2 picosiemens (n = 3) (Fig. 3 d), close to that reported for ASIC (14.3 picosiemens) (7Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. Nature. 1997; 386: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar). The unitary current has a reversal potential of +62 mV (Fig. 3 d), indicating an 11.5-fold higher selectivity of the channel for Na+ over K+. Amiloride inhibits the transient current with aK0.5 of 63 ± 2 μm (Fig. 3,e and f). The effect of amiloride on the sustained DRASIC current is complex. In the presence of 200 μm amiloride where the transient current is inhibited by 68 ± 5% (Fig. 3, e and f), the sustained current is higher than in the absence of amiloride (Fig. 3 e). A closer examination of the pH dependence of the DRASIC current shows that the transient and the sustained phase can be clearly separated (Fig. 3, g–i). The transient current is activated when the pH drops only slightly (half-maximal activation at pH 6.5 when stepping from pH 7.3; Fig. 3 h) but requires an initial pH above 7 for full activation (Fig. 3 i). On the contrary, the sustained current needs more important acidification (below pH 4) for activity (Fig. 3 h) but may still be activated if the resting pH is far below pH 7 (Fig. 3 i). The situation is similar in sensory neurons (1Bevan S. Yeats J. J. Physiol. ( Lond .). 1991; 433: 145-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) where a slight acidification activates only the transient current, while both the transient and the sustained current are activated after more important drops of the extracellular pH. A H+-gated cation channel capable of mediating a prolonged sensation of pain during tissue acidosis should not only be activated when the pH drops rapidly but also when the pH decreases slowly, since this is likely to happen during the onset of a tissue acidosis. Unlike ASIC, that requires a rapid (≪1 s) drop of the pH (not shown), DRASIC responds to slow decreases of the pH (Fig. 3 j). If the extracellular pH is decreased gradually by approaching the cell slowly with the perfusion outlet, the first transient current disappears, while the sustained component still develops to its full size (Fig. 3 j). The kinetics of the DRASIC channel and the fact that DRASIC mRNA is only present in sensory neurons, where it is abundant, suggest that DRASIC is part of the channel complex responsible for the sustained H+-gated current in sensory neurons. However, there are important differences between the non-inactivating DRASIC current and the sustained current described in sensory neurons (1Bevan S. Yeats J. J. Physiol. ( Lond .). 1991; 433: 145-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). To activate the sustained DRASIC current, the pH has to become very acidic (pH 4; Fig. 3 h), while a tonic response in sensory neurons is already obtained at pH 6 (1Bevan S. Yeats J. J. Physiol. ( Lond .). 1991; 433: 145-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Furthermore, both the rapidly inactivating and the sustained phase of the DRASIC current are highly selective for Na+, while in sensory neurons a transient Na+-selective current is followed by a sustained current that discriminates only poorly between Na+ and K+ (1Bevan S. Yeats J. J. Physiol. ( Lond .). 1991; 433: 145-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Those differences between the DRASIC current and the native current indicate that more than just DRASIC is required to form the non-inactivating H+-gated cation channel in sensory neurons. H+-gated sustained Na+-selective currents were never reported in sensory neurons, where DRASIC is well expressed, suggesting that DRASIC in sensory neurons has indeed properties distinct from the DRASIC channel expressed in COS cells. This might be due either to a specific posttranslational modification, such as phosphorylation, or to an association with other subunits. Heteromultimeric association of homologous subunits is commonly found with ion channels (22Hollmann M. Heinemann S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 31-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3662) Google Scholar, 23Lewis C. Neidhart S. Holy C. North R.A. Buell G. Surprenant A. Nature. 1995; 377: 432-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar) and might be the link between the DRASIC subunit and the sustained non-selective current recorded in sensory neurons. Furthermore, relatives of DRASIC, the amiloride-sensitive Na+ channel (13Canessa C. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C.

Nature. 1994; 367: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), even require several homologous subunits for correct function, and it would be surprising if this would not be the case for the H+-gated cation channels. ASIC, that is also expressed in sensory neurons (7Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. Nature. 1997; 386: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar), is not the missing partner of DRASIC since co-expression of both subunits yields currents that can be explained by two independent channels (not shown).Figure 2Northern blot and in situhybridization. a, Northern blot with 4 μg of total RNA of rat DRGs and 4 μg of poly(A+) RNA from rat brain.b–d, in situ hybridization. b, distribution of DRASIC mRNA in parasagittal sections of adult rat brain.Colors indicate the abundance (red, high expression; blue, non-detectable) of the transcript.

It is therefore likely that new members of this ion channel family will be discovered in the near future. The localization of their mRNAs and proteins should allow studies about the interaction of different H+-gated cation channel subunits expressed in the same type of neuron and might lead to the identification of subunit combinations with properties identical to the native H+-gated channels. The identification of subunits that associate with DRASIC is of particular interest because of the potential importance of sustained H+-gated cation currents for the prolonged sensation of pain caused by acids. The development of blockers that are selective for a H+-gated cation channel specific for sensory neurons, such as DRASIC, might lead to the discovery of new non-addictive analgesics.

https://openalex.org/W2042538218,"Recent studies have implicated the amyloid Aβ peptide and its ability to self-assemble as key factors in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Relatively little is known about the structure of soluble Aβ or its oligomeric state, and the existing data are often contradictory. In this study, we used intrinsic fluorescence of wild type Aβ-(1–40), fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), and gel filtration chromatography to examine the structure of Aβ-(1–40) in solution. We synthesized a series of mono-substituted fluorescent Aβ-(1–40) derivatives to use as donors and acceptors in FRET experiments. We selected fluorescent peptides that exhibit aggregation properties comparable to wild type Aβ for analysis in donor-acceptor pairs; two labeled with 5-(2-((iodoacetyl)amino)ethyl)aminonaphthylene-1-sulfonic acid at Cys-25 or Cys-34 and fluorescein maleimide at Cys-4 or Cys-7. Another peptide containing a Trp substitution at position 10 was used as an acceptor for the intrinsic Tyr fluorescence of wild type Aβ-(1–40). Equilibrium studies of the denaturation of Aβ-(1–40) by increasing concentrations of dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) were conducted by monitoring fluorescence, with a midpoint value for the unfolding transition of both the substituted and wild type peptides at among 40 and 50% Me2SO. Aβ-(1–40) is well solvated and largely monomeric in Me2SO as evidenced by a lack of FRET. When donor and acceptor Aβ derivatives are mixed together in Me2SO and then diluted 10-fold into aqueous Tris-HCl buffer at pH 7.4, efficient FRET is observed immediately for all pairs of fluorescent peptides, indicating that donor-acceptor dimers exist in solution. FRET is abolished by the addition of an excess of unlabeled Aβ-(1–40), demonstrating that the fluorescent peptides interact with wild type Aβ-(1–40) to form heterodimers that do not exhibit FRET. The Aβ-(1–40) dimers appear to be very stable, because no subunit exchange is observed after 24 h between fluorescent homodimers. Gel filtration confirms that nanomolar concentrations of14C-labeled Aβ-(1–40) and fluorescein-labeled Aβ-(1–40) elute at the same dimeric position as wild type Aβ-(1–40), suggesting that soluble Aβ-(1–40) is also dimeric at more physiologically plausible concentrations. Recent studies have implicated the amyloid Aβ peptide and its ability to self-assemble as key factors in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Relatively little is known about the structure of soluble Aβ or its oligomeric state, and the existing data are often contradictory. In this study, we used intrinsic fluorescence of wild type Aβ-(1–40), fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), and gel filtration chromatography to examine the structure of Aβ-(1–40) in solution. We synthesized a series of mono-substituted fluorescent Aβ-(1–40) derivatives to use as donors and acceptors in FRET experiments. We selected fluorescent peptides that exhibit aggregation properties comparable to wild type Aβ for analysis in donor-acceptor pairs; two labeled with 5-(2-((iodoacetyl)amino)ethyl)aminonaphthylene-1-sulfonic acid at Cys-25 or Cys-34 and fluorescein maleimide at Cys-4 or Cys-7. Another peptide containing a Trp substitution at position 10 was used as an acceptor for the intrinsic Tyr fluorescence of wild type Aβ-(1–40). Equilibrium studies of the denaturation of Aβ-(1–40) by increasing concentrations of dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) were conducted by monitoring fluorescence, with a midpoint value for the unfolding transition of both the substituted and wild type peptides at among 40 and 50% Me2SO. Aβ-(1–40) is well solvated and largely monomeric in Me2SO as evidenced by a lack of FRET. When donor and acceptor Aβ derivatives are mixed together in Me2SO and then diluted 10-fold into aqueous Tris-HCl buffer at pH 7.4, efficient FRET is observed immediately for all pairs of fluorescent peptides, indicating that donor-acceptor dimers exist in solution. FRET is abolished by the addition of an excess of unlabeled Aβ-(1–40), demonstrating that the fluorescent peptides interact with wild type Aβ-(1–40) to form heterodimers that do not exhibit FRET. The Aβ-(1–40) dimers appear to be very stable, because no subunit exchange is observed after 24 h between fluorescent homodimers. Gel filtration confirms that nanomolar concentrations of14C-labeled Aβ-(1–40) and fluorescein-labeled Aβ-(1–40) elute at the same dimeric position as wild type Aβ-(1–40), suggesting that soluble Aβ-(1–40) is also dimeric at more physiologically plausible concentrations. The extracellular deposition of β-amyloid in senile plaques is one of neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. Biochemical analysis of the amyloid peptides isolated from Alzheimer's disease brain indicates that amyloid β (Aβ) 1The abbreviations used are: Aβ, amyloid β; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; 1,5-IAEDANS, 5-(2-((iodoacetyl)amino)ethyl)aminonaphthylene-1-sulfonic acid; FM, fluorescein maleimide; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; AβC25AEDANS, Aβ with Cys in position 25 and labeled with 1,5-IAEDANS; AβC7FM, Aβ with Cys in position 7 and labeled with FM; AβC34AEDANS, Aβ with Cys in position 34 and labeled with 1,5-IAEDANS; AβC4FM, Aβ with Cys in position 4 and labeled with FM; Aβ-(1–40), Aβ wild type; AβY10W, Aβ with Trp in position 10; [3H]Aβ-(1–40), Aβ-(1–40) radioactively labeled with tritium ([3H]Phe) at position 4; [14C]Aβ-(1–40), Aβ-(1–40) radioactively labeled with 14C ([14C]Ala) at position 2; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. 1–42 is the principal species associated with senile plaque amyloid (1Rogers J.

Aβ is folded into the β-sheet structure that is characteristic of amyloid fibrils. Amyloid plaque formation may involve two basic steps: the initial formation of a seeding aggregate that establishes the amyloid fibril lattice (2Kirschner D.A. Inouye H. Duffy L.K. Sinclair A.

Some of the key parameters that promote the assembly of amyloid fibril include high peptide concentration, long incubation time and low pH (pH 5–6) (4Barrow C.J. Zagorski M.G.

The Aβ-(1–42) isoform aggregates at a significantly greater rate and to a greater extent at pH 7.4 than Aβ-(1–40). Assembly of Aβ into the fibrils may also be promoted by molecules that interact with Aβ and increase its rate of aggregation in vitro including apolipoprotein E (9Strittmatter W.J. Weiswraber K.H.

Although many of the parameters influencing fibril assembly have been elucidated, relatively little is known about the structure of soluble Aβ. Understanding the structure of Aβ may provide insight into how this peptide assembles into the amyloid fibrils characteristic of Alzheimer's disease and other amyloidoses. Gel filtration analyses of Aβ in solution have revealed the presence of multiple, discrete structures that have been variously interpreted as monomer, dimer, trimer, and higher order aggregates (8Hilbich C. Kisters-Woike B. Reed J. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 149-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 13Bush A.I. Pettingell Jr., W.H. de Paradis M. Tanzi R.E. J. Biol.

While differences in the concentration of the peptide, time of incubation, and the structure of Aβ (16Soreghan B. Kosmoski J. Glabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28551-28554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) can account for some of the discrepancies in the oligomeric species observed in the studies cited above, it is not clear that the identities assigned to the peaks are correct, since gel filtration only measures the effective hydrodynamic radius of a molecule and not its molecular mass. Previous studies from this laboratory indicate that the smallest species in aqueous solution elutes from a gel filtration column with an apparent molecular mass appropriate for a dimer for both Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–42) and at higher concentrations, larger micelle-like oligomers also exist in solution (16Soreghan B. Kosmoski J. Glabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28551-28554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of these micelle-like oligomers has been confirmed by dynamic light scattering measurements (18Lomakin A. Chung D.S. Benedek G.B. Kirschner D.A. Teplow D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In this work, we have used the intrinsic fluorescence of wild type Aβ-(1–40) and fluorescence resonance energy transfer in conjunction with gel filtration chromatography to define the oligomeric state of soluble Aβ-(1–40). Here we report that soluble Aβ-(1–40) forms a stable dimer at concentrations from the low nanomolar range up to the critical concentration of approximately 25 μm, as evidenced by the observation of efficient FRET between several different combinations of donor and acceptor peptides. This suggests that soluble Aβ-(1–40) adopts an ordered conformation in solution as a prelude to fibril assembly and that dimerization is an initial event in amyloid self-assembly. All Aβ peptide analogs were synthesized by fluoren-9-ylmethoxy carbonyl chemistry using a continuous flow semiautomatic instrument as described previously (5Burdick D. Soreghan B. Kwon M. Kosmoski J. Knauer M. Henschen A. Yates J. Cotman C. Glabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 546-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The peptides were purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography, and the purity and expected structure was verified by electrospray mass spectrometry. Only peptides exhibiting 90.0% or greater purity with less than 5.0% of a single contaminant were used. Cys substitution mutants were synthesized simultaneously by the same method, except that at locations where Cys was substituted, a portion of the resin was coupled separately with Cys. [3H]Aβ-(1–40) and [14C]Aβ-(1–40) were synthesized by incorporation of Fmoc-[3H]Phe or Fmoc-[14C]Ala at positions 4 and 2 respectively, yielding specific activities of 200 mCi/mmol for [3H]Aβ-(1–40) and 36 mCi/mmol for [14C]Aβ-(1–40). 1,5-IAEDANS and FM were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). All other reagents were of the highest analytical grade commercially available. We use a shorthand notation to refer to the Aβ-(1–40) analogs that indicates the position of the Cys substitution with the understanding that all peptides are 40 residues long and the rest of the sequence is that of wild type Aβ as described in the abbreviations list. Since Aβ-(1–40) was modified with a single Cys at different positions, the sulfydryl-specific reagents FM and 1,5-IAEDANS were used to prepare fluorescent derivatives. The Aβ-(1–40) analog peptide was dissolved in 10 mm MOPS, pH 8.5, at a concentration of 25 μm (pH 7.4 in the case of fluorescein labeling). 1,5-IAEDANS or FM was added to this solution from a stock solution of 10 mm at a 20-fold (for 1,5-IAEDANS) or 5-fold (for FM) molar excess over Aβ-(1–40). The reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature in the dark for 6 h. Free fluorophore was then removed by filtration on a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with 10 mm MOPS at pH 7.4. Labeled Aβ-(1–40) was aliquoted, lyophilized, and stored at −20 °C. Protein was determined by Coomassie R protein assay reagent (Pierce). The concentrations of 1,5-IAEDANS or FM were spectrophotometrically determined by using their molar extinction coefficients (5.7 mm−1 at 336 nm or 83 mm−1 at 490 nm, respectively). The labeling stoichiometry of the final products was 1.0. The stoichiometry was confirmed by laser desorption mass spectrometry that demonstrated all of the precursor has been converted to a mass appropriate for fluorescent peptide. Aggregation was determined using a sedimentation assay as described previously (5Burdick D. Soreghan B. Kwon M. Kosmoski J. Knauer M. Henschen A. Yates J. Cotman C. Glabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 546-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 75 μm[3H]Aβ-(1–40) (specific activity 36 mCi/mmol) was mixed with 5 μm fluorescent Aβ-(1–40) in either 0.1m NaAc, pH 5.0, 0.1 m NaCl, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4 or 0.1 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 70 μm ZnCl2, and incubated for 48 h at room temperature. The radiolabeled and fluorescent peptides were diluted 10-fold from water stock solutions upon mixing. The samples were centrifugated at 15,000 × g for 10 min in a Beckman Microfuge 11. Afterward, the amount of fluorescent and tritiated wild type Aβ in both the supernatant and pellet was determined by measuring the fluorescence intensity and the radioactivity by scintillation counting. Gel filtration analysis was performed with a Pharmacia Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column using a Waters 490 multiple wavelength UV absorbance detector and Hewlett Packard 3250 fluorescence detector. Data were collected with a Waters Maxima chromatography data system, with a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Because the refolding experiments of Aβ-(1–40) were carried out by diluting the Me2SO to subdenaturing concentrations, the running buffer used was 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 7.4 (buffer A) in the presence of 10% or 2% Me2SO. The column was calibrated several times using the buffer A in the presence of 10% or 2% Me2SO, the standards were chromatographed both separately and in mixtures, obtaining the same calibration curve in all conditions. The standards used to calibrate the column and their masses (Da) are: thyroglobulin (670,000), bovine serum albumin (68,000), ovalbumin (43,000), soybean trypsin inhibitor (23,000), ubiquitin (8500), aprotinin (6500), and acetone (58). The peptides were detected by UV absorbance at 280 nm and by fluorescence emission at 482 nm for 1,5-IAEDANS (or at 520 nm for FM) upon excitation at 336 nm (or 490 nm for FM). 11 μm Aβ-(1–40) or AβC25AEDANS was incubated in increasing concentrations of Me2SO, at 24 °C. Emission spectra were recorded after 30 min incubation from 290 to 400 nm upon excitation at 280 nm (or from 346–600 upon excitation at 336 nm for AβC25AEDANS). Emission spectra were not recorded at longer incubation times as Aβ aggregates (19Snyder S.W. Ladror U.S. Wade W.S. Wang G.T. Barrett L.W. Matayoshi E.D. Huffaker H.J. Krafft G.A. Holzman T.F. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 1216-1228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). For refolding experiments, samples were incubated in 100% Me2SO for 30 min at room temperature and refolding was initiated by 10-or 50-fold dilution of the Me2SO solution in Tris-HCl buffered solution. The concentration of peptide ranged between 3 and 10 μm. Absorption measurements were measured with a Perkin Elmer Lambda 3B UV-Vis spectrophotometer. Fluorescence spectra (excitation band pass 4 nm; emission band pass 8 nm) were measured either on an Aminco SLM 48000 or a SPEX Fluorolog F112A spectrofluorometer. Intrinsic Tyr fluorescence was measured from 285 to 400 upon excitation at 275 nm. For AβC25AEDANS or in energy transfer experiments, excitation was at 330, and the spectra were obtained from 340 to 620 nm. In all cases, emission fluorescence spectra of identical samples (without protein) were recorded. These were subtracted from the experimental samples. The lifetime measurements for FM were acquired using the 488 nm line of argon ion laser for excitation using a multiharmonic frequency-domain spectrofluorometer (Aminco 48000S). The efficiency (E) of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between probes was determined by measuring the fluorescence intensity of the donor (AβC-AEDANS or Aβ-(1–40)) both in the absence (Fd) and presence (Fda) of the acceptor (AβC-FM or AβY10W), as given by Equation 1.E=1−(Fda/Fd)Equation 1 The efficiency of FRET depends on the inverse sixth power of the distance between donor and acceptor (20Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence. Plenum Press, New York1983Crossref Google Scholar). This allows FRET measurements to be used with high sensitivity to follow the association of fluorescent-labeled Aβ-(1–40) monomers during refolding of the peptide in aqueous solution. Stock solutions of peptide in Me2SO were mixed at an equal molar ratio and diluted 10-fold or 50-fold (to dilute Me2SO to subdenaturing concentrations) into 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mNaCl, pH 7.4, and the fluorescence spectra recorded at various times after dilution. Controls included the donor and acceptor peptides diluted separately and either donor or acceptor in Me2SO, mixed with an equal amount of nonlabeled Aβ-(1–40), and then allowed to refold by dilution of Me2SO. To demonstrate the feasibility of the experiments employing fluorescent Aβ analogs, we synthesized a series of Aβ-(1–40) variants containing a single Cys substitution. We chose Aβ-(1–40) because it is stable over the time interval required for these experiments, while Aβ-(1–42) rapidly forms higher order oligomers that would complicate the interpretation of the fluorescence data (16Soreghan B. Kosmoski J. Glabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28551-28554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Roher A.E. Chaney M.O. Kuo Y.-M. Webster S.D. Stine W.B. Haverkamp L.J. Woods A.S. Cotter R.J. Tuohy J.M. Krafft G.A. Bonnell B.S. Emmerling M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20631-20635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Cys was chosen because of its unique chemical reactivity and its absence in the wild type Aβ sequence. We initially synthesized a series of Cys substitutions by replacing every third residue, because the Cys side chain would be expected to alternate on opposite sides of the strand in a β-sheet structure. The Cys-containing probe peptides were covalently labeled with a variety of extrinsic fluorescent probes. For this work we used Aβ-(1–40) Cys mutants labeled with 1,5-IAEDANS at positions 25 and 34 and FM-labeled Aβ-(1–40) Cys mutants at positions 4 and 7. Mass spectrometry confirmed the expected mass of the final product, and the absence of the precursor peptide indicated that the labeling reaction was complete (data not shown). We also synthesized a probe containing Trp instead of Tyr at position 10 to use as an acceptor for the wild type peptide intrinsic Tyr fluorescence. Some of the other peptides synthesized were not analyzed because they either labeled inefficiently or displayed significantly altered aggregation properties (data not shown). An obvious concern in modifying the structure of Aβ to make fluorescent derivatives is whether the modification significantly alters the structure and properties of Aβ. We compared the aggregation properties of the fluorescent derivatives to wild type Aβ under physiological conditions where it is largely soluble (e.g. Tris-HCl buffered saline at pH 7.4) and under conditions that are known to promote fibril assembly (pH 5.0 and at pH 7.4 in the presence of ZnCl2) (Fig. 1). At pH 7.4 and at pH 5.0, the sedimentation behavior of all of the fluorescent peptides used is indistinguishable from wild type Aβ-(1–40). In the presence of 70 μm Zn2+, the fluorescein- and AEDANS-labeled Aβ peptides aggregate to approximately 50–75% of the extent of wild type Aβ. However, Trp substitution at residue 10 did not alter the aggregation behavior in response to Zn2+. Several of the other Cys substitution mutant peptides we synthesized were not suitable for further analysis because either they failed to label efficiently or the labeled peptides displayed significantly altered aggregation properties (data not shown). The oligomeric structure of the fluorescent peptides was characterized by gel filtration chromatography, and we found that the fluorescent peptides AβC25AEDANS and AβC7FM elute at the same position as wild type Aβ-(1–40) (Fig. 2). The elution position corresponds to an apparent molecular mass of 9000 Da established by the elution behavior of a series of calibration standards as reported previously (16Soreghan B. Kosmoski J. Glabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28551-28554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 A,inset). The other fluorescent peptides used in this study also elute as a dimer (data not shown). The calibration curve also indicates that the expected elution position for a peptide of the mass of monomeric Aβ-(1–40) is well separated from the observed elution position of dimeric Aβ-(1–40). Nanomolar concentrations of14C-labeled Aβ-(1–40) also elute at the position expected for a dimer (Fig. 2 B). Since gel filtration only measures the effective Stokes' radius, the elution behavior is not definitive evidence for the interpretation that the peak represents a dimer. To more definitively determine the structure of soluble Aβ-(1–40) by FRET, we had to first establish conditions for the denaturation and renaturation of Aβ-(1–40). Previous studies using a combination of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and dynamic light scattering (7Shen C.L., S. Murphy M. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 640-651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 19Snyder S.W. Ladror U.S. Wade W.S. Wang G.T. Barrett L.W. Matayoshi E.D. Huffaker H.J. Krafft G.A. Holzman T.F. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 1216-1228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) suggested that Aβ is a random coil monomer in Me2SO. The intrinsic fluorescence of proteins provides a signal commonly used to monitor conformational changes and unfolding (22Wu P. Yaw-Kuen L. Talalay P. Brand L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7415-74222Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In the present work we used the intrinsic Tyr fluorescence of wild type Aβ-(1–40) to study the denaturation of Aβ in Me2SO and its renaturation. The Tyr emission of most native proteins and peptides is frequently small or undetectable due to the presence of more highly fluorescent Trp residues (20Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence. Plenum Press, New York1983Crossref Google Scholar, 22Wu P. Yaw-Kuen L. Talalay P. Brand L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7415-74222Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), but Trp is absent in Aβ. The spectral properties of extrinsic fluorescent probes can also be exploited to obtain information about the environment surrounding the probe and to examine whether the environment changes upon aggregation and assembly (20Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence. Plenum Press, New York1983Crossref Google Scholar). The denaturation curve for wild type Aβ-(1–40) showed a single, smooth cooperative transition (Fig. 3). Increasing concentrations of Me2SO increased the intrinsic fluorescence intensity of Aβ-(1–40), indicating that a significant increase in the exposure of the Tyr residue occurs in the unfolded state. The midpoint of intrinsic fluorescence changes occurred at approximately 40% Me2SO. The emission maximum of Tyr is not affected by Me2SO, remaining the same at all concentrations (e.g. 308 nm) because the Tyr fluorescence emission maximum is not sensitive to the polarity of the solvent (20Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence. Plenum Press, New York1983Crossref Google Scholar). The data have been corrected for the relatively small solvent effect of Me2SO on free Tyr (less that 5% of the intensity change observed for Aβ-(1–40)) to ensure that the curve accurately reflects the unfolding of Aβ-(1–40). We also examined the denaturation of the extrinsically-labeled fluorescent Aβ-(1–40) probes. For environment-sensitive fluorophores (like 1,5-IAEDANS) the emission maximum shifts to a shorter wavelength (blue shift) as the polarity of the surrounding environment decreases (20Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence. Plenum Press, New York1983Crossref Google Scholar). Conversely the emission maximum shifts to the longer wavelengths (red shift) in a more polar environment. For AβC25AEDANS, a marked blue shift (42 nm) of the emission was observed upon unfolding by Me2SO (Fig. 3), indicating that the fluorophore is increasingly exposed to the surrounding media at increasing Me2SO concentrations. As with the intrinsic Tyr fluorescence, the midpoint of the blue shift of AEDANS occurred at approximately 50% Me2SO. The unfolding transition was recorded after 30 min of incubation in Me2SO, as it has been reported that longer incubation times lead to an aggregated comformation of Aβ (19Snyder S.W. Ladror U.S. Wade W.S. Wang G.T. Barrett L.W. Matayoshi E.D. Huffaker H.J. Krafft G.A. Holzman T.F. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 1216-1228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). At concentrations of Me2SO below 10%, there is little further change in the intrinsic fluorescence emission of Aβ-(1–40) or the extrinsic fluorescence of AβC25AEDANS (Fig. 3). These results indicate that AEDANS-labeled and wild type Aβ-(1–40) peptides have similar stabilities and suggest that there is relatively little change in the overall structure of Aβ-(1–40) over the range of Me2SO from 0 to 10%. The renaturation of Aβ-(1–40) from Me2SO solution was also examined. Upon 10-fold dilution of Me2SO into aqueous buffer solution, the emission spectrum of wild type Aβ-(1–40) and AβC25AEDANS showed the same maximum at 308 and 494 nm, respectively, as observed for the peptides dissolved directly in buffer A, indicating that the denatured peptide returns to the same overall structure (Fig. 4, A and B). Time course studies indicated that the refolding of the peptide was immediate (data not shown). Similar denaturation and renaturation results were obtained with guanidine HCl (data not shown). Me2SO stock solutions of peptide were employed for all of the subsequent experiments. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer between AEDANS and fluorescein was used initially to monitor association of Aβ-(1–40) monomers following dilution of Me2SO into aqueous buffer solution. For these experiments, AβC25AEDANS and AβC7FM Me2SO stock solutions were mixed 1:1 (donor:acceptor), and then subsequently diluted 10-fold in buffer A. The final concentration of the peptide was 3 μm. The resulting fluorescence spectra are shown in Fig. 5 A. Efficient FRET was observed, as evidenced by a quenching of the donor emission at 474 nm and an increase in the acceptor fluorescence at 520 nm, compared with the control spectra, indicating that hybrid Aβ-(1–40) dimers had formed in the mixture containing both donor and acceptor (Fig. 5 A). The efficiency of FRET did not change significantly upon subsequent incubation for 24 h (data not shown). To control for possible effects of peptide structure on the fluorescence intensity of labeled peptides, we carried out control measurements in which either AβC25AEDANS or AβC7FM were individually mixed with an equal amount of non-labeled peptide in Me2SO, and then diluted 10-fold in buffer A.

We report here that caspase-2 (ICH-1/NEDD-2), a member of the ICE family, is activated during apoptosis by another ICE member, a caspase-3 (CPP32)-like protease(s). When cells are induced to undergo apoptosis, endogenous caspase-2 is first cleaved into three fragments of 32–33 kDa and 14 kDa, which are then further processed into 18- and 12-kDa active subunits. Up to 50 μm N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aldehyde (DEVD-CHO), a caspase-3-preferred peptide inhibitor, inhibits caspase-2 activation and DNA fragmentation in vivo, but does not prevent loss of mitochondrial function, while higher concentrations of DEVD-CHO (>50 μm) inhibit both. In comparison, although the activity of caspase-3 is very sensitive to the inhibition of DEVD-CHO (<50 nm), inhibition of caspase-3 activation as marked by processing of the proform requires more than 100 μmDEVD-CHO. Our results suggest that the first cleavage of caspase-2 is accomplished by a caspase-3-like activity, and other ICE-like proteases less sensitive to DEVD-CHO may be responsible for activation of caspase-3 and loss of mitochondrial function.

These results indicate that the ICE family plays important roles in mammalian apoptosis. The roles played by individual members of the caspase family in controlling apoptosis are the subjects of intensive debates and investigations.Nedd-2, the murine caspase-2, was identified by Kumaret al. (32Kumar S. Tomooka Y. Noda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 1155-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) as a mRNA expressed mostly during early embryonic brain development and down-regulated in adult brain. Overexpression of Nedd-2 in cultured fibroblast and neuroblastoma cells results in cell death by apoptosis, which is suppressed by the expression of the human bcl-2 gene (5Kumar S. Kinoshita M. Noda M. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1613-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Previous work in our lab has shown that the human caspase-2,Ich-1 (Ice and ced-3 homolog), encodes a protein that shares sequence similarities with ICE and CED-3 proteins (6Wang L. Miura M. Bergeron L. Zhu H. Yuan J. Cell. 1994; 78: 739-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). Two different forms of mRNA species derived from alternative splicing encode two proteins, ICH-1L and ICH-1S, which have antagonistic effects on cell death. ICH-1L (435 amino acids) contains sequence homologous to both p20 and p10 subunits of ICE, while ICH-1S (312 amino acids) is a truncated version of ICH-1L, containing only the p20 region. Previous studies of Ich-1 in our laboratory revealed that overexpression of Ich-1L induces programmed cell death, while overexpression ofIch-1S suppresses Rat-1 cell death induced by serum deprivation. These results suggest that Ich-1 may play an important role in both positive and negative regulation of programmed cell death. Apoptosis induced by ICH-1 is suppressed by overexpression of bcl-2, but not by crmA. Northern blotting and reverse transcription-PCR results showed thatIch-1 is expressed in many tissues and cells with tissue and developmental stage specificities. Expression of Ich-1 is detected in HeLa, THP.1, U937, and Jurkat cells. The expression patterns of these two alternatively spliced forms of Ich-1show tissue-specific differences; expression of bothIch-1L and Ich-1S can be detected in heart, kidney, and embryonic and adult brain with the expression of Ich-1S being highest in embryonic brain, and only Ich-1L is expressed in adult thymus.To investigate the mechanism and function of caspase-2 (NEDD-2/ICH-1) in apoptosis, we examined the processing and activation of caspase-2 when cells undergo apoptosis. We demonstrate here that caspase-2 is processed and activated in a specific temporal sequence when cells are induced to undergo apoptosis by diverse stimuli. Our results show that caspase-2 is activated by a caspase-3 (CPP32)-like protease when cells are induced to undergo apoptosis. Moreover, caspase-2 activation can be distinguished from activation of caspase-3 and loss of mitochondrial function by their sensitivity to inhibitors of the ICE family.DISCUSSIONWe have demonstrated that caspase-2 (NEDD-2/ICH-1), a member of the ICE family, is activated when cells are induced to undergo apoptosis by diverse stimuli such as anti-Fas antibody, TNFα, and staurosporine. When cells are induced to undergo apoptosis, endogenous caspase-2 is first cleaved into three fragments of 32–33 and 14 kDa, which are then processed further into 18-kDa and 12-kDa active subunit. When overexpressed in bacteria, the fragment of caspase-2 without its N-terminal pro-domain was cleaved into two peptides of 18 and 12 kDa, which are enzymatically active, similar to what has been reported (46Xue D. Shaham S. Horvitz H.R. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 1073-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The 18-kDa polypeptide detected by anti-caspase-2 antibody in apoptotic cells is likely to be the large subunit of active caspase-2. Taken together, our in vitro and in vivo observations strongly suggest that caspase-2 is indeed activated when cells undergo apoptosis.The mechanism of activation of ICE/CED-3 cysteine proteases remains unclear so far. Two possible mechanisms, which are not mutually exclusive, may be involved. The first mechanism is that each member of the caspase family is activated through self-catalytic cleavage upon dissociation with a putative inhibitor(s). The evidence supporting this notion is that several members, when overexpressed in vitro, are capable of undergoing self-cleavage to generate active enzymes (10Faucheu C. Diu A. Chan A.W. Blanchet A.M. Miossec C. Herve F. Collard-Dutilleul V. Gu Y. Aldape R.A. Lippke J.A. Rocher C. Su M.S.-S. Livingston D.J. Hercend T. Lalanne J.

Revesz L. Wishart W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9378-9383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The second possible mechanism is cross-activation whereby one caspase activates another one(s). We found that while caspase-2 activity in vitro is much less sensitive to the inhibition by DEVD-CHO than that of caspase-3, the activation of caspase-2 in cells, as indicated by the cleavage of pro-caspase-2, is as sensitive to the inhibition by DEVD-CHO as that of cleavage of PARP, an indicator of caspase-3-like activity. Our results suggest that caspase-2 is most likely to be activated by a caspase-3-like activity rather than by a self-activation mechanism. It has been shown that in in vitro assay systems, caspase-4 (TX/ICH-2) can process both pro-caspase-4 and pro-caspase-1 (10Faucheu C. Diu A. Chan A.W. Blanchet A.M. Miossec C. Herve F. Collard-Dutilleul V. Gu Y. Aldape R.A. Lippke J.A. Rocher C. Su M.S.-S. Livingston D.J. Hercend T. Lalanne J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1914-1922Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), and caspase-1 can process and activate pro-caspase-1 and caspase-3 (8Tewari M. Quan L.T. O'Rourke K. Desnoyers S. Zeng Z. Beidler D.R. Poirier G.G. Salveson G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 801-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2264) Google Scholar). It is not clear, however, whether such cross-activation indeed occurs in cells undergoing apoptosis. Our study demonstrated that in vivo one member of the caspase family, caspase-2, is activated by another member of the caspase family, a caspase-3-like protease(s), when cells are induced to undergo apoptosis by staurosporine and anti-Fas antibody. Dr. Shige Nagata's laboratory has shown that when cells are induced to undergo apoptosis by anti-Fas antibody, there is a sequential activation of caspase-1-like and caspase-3-like proteases (48Enari M. Talanian R.V. Wong W.W. Nagata S. Nature. 1996; 380: 723-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). Our results extended their observation by revealing downstream targets of the caspase-3-like proteases. The observation that caspase-2 was processed in CTL-mediated apoptosis, but granzyme B cannot cleave caspase-2 directly, also suggests that other factors mediate caspase-2 activation in perforin-granzyme B killing. Taken together, we propose a model of sequential activation involving three subfamilies of ICE/CED-3 proteases in the execution of programmed cell death. In this model, when cells are stimulated with a death signal such as anti-Fas antibody, a caspase-1-like protease(s) is activated first, followed by activation of a caspase-3-like protease(s) that may be mediated by the caspase-1-like activity, and then a caspase-3-like protease(s) activates caspase-2. We do not know, however, the exact identities of the upstream caspase-1- and caspase-3-like activity. Further studies using mutant mice that are defective in one or more members of the caspase family proteases are needed to clarify these questions.Caspase-3 protease is activated by cleavage events at Asp-28/Ser-29 (between N-terminal pro-domain) and Asp-175/Ser-176 (between the large and the small subunits) to generate a large subunit of 17 kDa and a small subunit of 12 kDa (7Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30761-30764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas pro-caspase-1 is activated through four cleavage events: two cleavages between the N-terminal prodomain (Asp-103/Ser-104 and Asp-119/Asn-120) and two between the large and small subunits (Asp-297/Ser-298 and Asp-316/Ala-317) (2Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Calaycay J.R. Chapman K.T. Howard A.D. Kostura M.J. Miller D.K. Molineaux S.M. Weidner J.R. Aunins J. Elliston K.O. Ayala J.M. Casano F.J. Chin J. Ding G.J.-F. Egger L.A. Gaffney E.P. Limjuco G. Palyha O.C. Raju S.M. Rolando A.M. Salley J.P. Yamin T.-T. Lee T.D. Shively J.E. MacCross M. Mumford R.A. Schmidt J.A. Tocci M.J. Nature. 1992; 356: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (2185) Google Scholar). The temporal sequences of proteolytic cleavages during caspase-1 and -3 activation are not clear. We showed here that activation of caspase-2 occurs in distinct cleavage steps. The timing of the first cleavage between the large subunit and the small subunit coincides with the activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of PARP. This cleavage is inhibitable by DEVD-CHO in vivo and in vitro, although the active caspase-2 itself is much less sensitive to this inhibitor than that of caspase-3. These two observations suggest strongly that this first cleavage of caspase-2 is carried out by caspase-3 or a caspase-3-like protease. Our in vitro data indicate that a single cleavage between the large subunit and the small subunit of caspsae-3, however, is insufficient to activate caspase-2. The second cleavage of caspase-2, between the pro-domain and the large subunit, occurs much later at 4 h, when 25% of cells are dead as estimated by MTT assay. Neither caspase-3 nor active caspase-2 can carry out this second cleavage in vitro, suggesting that this cleavage is executed by an uncharacterized protease.Apoptosis is usually measured by MTT assay, DNA fragmentation, or trypan blue exclusion (49McGahon A. Martin S. Bissonnette R. Mahboubi A. Shi Y. Mogil R. Nishioka W. Green D.R. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 46: 153-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Each of these procedures measures a different parameter of cell viability. Trypan blue exclusion measures the integrity of cell membrane or permeability change. Disruption of the cytoplasmic membrane occurs relatively late in apoptosis. DNA fragmentation, representing an alteration in nuclei, occurs much earlier than changes in cell membrane permeability (our unpublished observation). The MTT assay is a quantitative colorimetric assay based on reduction of a tetrazolium salt, MTT. MTT is reduced within the active mitochondria of living cells by the enzyme succinate dehydrogenase (50Carmichael J. DeGraff W. Gazdcar A. Minna J. Mitchell J. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 943-946PubMed Google Scholar). The salt is reduced to an insoluble blue formazan product in living cells but not in the mitochondria or cellular debris of dead cells. 70–80% of mitochondrial MTT reduction occurs subsequent to transfer of electrons from cytochrome c to cytochrome oxidase, but prior to the point of azide inhibition (51Berridge M. Tan A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 303: 474-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar). Loss of mitochondrial function, a process beginning with a decrease in mitochondrial transmembrane potential, followed by mitochondrial uncoupling and generation of reactive oxygen species, precedes nuclear alteration (52Kroemer G. Petit P. Zamzami N. Vayssiere J. Mignotte B. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1277-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar). Recently, release of cytochrome c from mitochondria has been shown to be an early and essential step of apoptosis in a cell-free system induced by dATP (53Liu X. Kim C. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4433) Google Scholar). Our data showed here that there is a concentration of DEVD-CHO (50 μm), which inhibits the cleavage and activation of caspase-2 by a caspase-3-like activity and DNA fragmentation but does not alter viability as measured by MTT, suggesting that DEVD-CHO at that dose can block activation of the caspase family members such as caspase-2 but cannot block loss of mitochondrial function in apoptosis induced by anti-Fas antibody. These results indicate that activation of caspase-2 by a caspase-3-like activity is separable from the loss of mitochondrial function. Higher doses of DEVD-CHO, however, can inhibit loss of mitochondrial function as measured by MTT. Since the subfamily of caspase-1-like proteases that are mostly closely related to caspase-1 requires higher concentrations of DEVD-CHO for inhibition, this result suggests that there is an caspase-1-like activity further upstream from loss of mitochondrial function. This result is consistent with the report by Enari et al. (48Enari M. Talanian R.V. Wong W.W. Nagata S. Nature. 1996; 380: 723-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar), who showed that activation of an caspase-1-like activity precedes the activation of caspase-3-like activities in apoptosis induced by anti-Fas activity. It is not clear, however, in lieu of the recent report of caspase-8 (FLICE/MACH), an caspase-3-like protease containing MORT domain that allows direct coupling to the Fas receptor upon activation, the exact identity of this caspase-1-like activity.

We recently reported that Ras interaction with the Raf-1 cysteine-rich domain (Raf-CRD, residues 139–184) may be required for Raf-1 activation. The Raf-CRD is located in the NH2-terminal negative regulatory domain of Raf-1 and is highly homologous to cysteine-rich domains found in protein kinase C family members. Recent studies indicate that the structural integrity of the Raf-CRD is also critical for Raf-1 interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. However, whether 14-3-3 proteins interact directly with the Raf-CRD and how this interaction may mediate Raf-1 function has not been determined. In the present study, we demonstrate that 14-3-3 ζ binds directly to the isolated Raf-CRD. Moreover, mutation of Raf-1 residues 143–145 impairs binding of 14-3-3, but not Ras, to the Raf-CRD. Introduction of mutations that impair 14-3-3 binding resulted in full-length Raf-1 mutants with enhanced transforming activity. Thus, 14-3-3 interaction with the Raf-CRD may serve in negative regulation of Raf-1 function by facilitating dissociation of 14-3-3 from the NH2 terminus of Raf-1 to promote subsequent events necessary for full activation of Raf-1.

Hence, full kinase activation involves a complex multistep process that remains to be elucidated fully.An additional complexity of Ras-mediated activation of Raf-1 is that the Ras/Raf-1 interaction is more convoluted than originally believed. We and others have shown recently that Ras interacts with two distinct Ras-binding domains in the NH2-terminal regulatory region of Raf-1 (18Brtva T.R. Drugan J.K. Ghosh S. Terrell R.S.

The first Ras-binding domain encompasses Raf-1 residues 55–131 (20Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar, 21Ghosh S.

This second binding region is contained within the Raf-1 cysteine-rich domain (residues 139–184, designated the Raf-CRD; also called Raf-Cys or Raf-C1) that resembles the C1 domains of protein kinase C family members (22Hurley, J. H., Newton, A. C., Parker, P. J., Blumberg, P. M., and Nishizuka, Y. (1997) Protein Sci., in press.Google Scholar). Although the precise role of this second Ras/Raf-1 interaction is unclear, we recently determined that Ras interaction with the Raf-CRD is required for Ras transforming activity (19Drugan J.K.

We hypothesized that Ras interaction with Raf-1 residues 55–131 promotes Raf-1 association with the plasma membrane while Ras interaction with the Raf-CRD stabilizes this membrane association and/or relieves the regulatory effects of the NH2 terminus. Hence, additional interactions between Ras and Raf-CRD may promote further activation events that could involve interactions with 14-3-3 proteins or phospholipids.14-3-3 proteins bind directly with Raf-1 in vitro andin vivo (13Fantl W.J.

Biol. 1995; 15: 3390-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Moreover, there are conflicting reports regarding the relationship between the activated state of Raf-1 and its ability to bind 14-3-3 proteins (14Freed E. Symons M. Macdonald S.G. McCormick F. Ruggieri R. Science. 1994; 265: 1713-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 15Fu H. Xia K. Palla D.C. Cui C. Conroy K. Narsimhan R.P. Mamon H. Collier R.J. Roberts T.M.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 685-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar).Contradictory reports regarding the role of 14-3-3 proteins in Raf-1 activation may be due, in part, to the existence of multiple 14-3-3 binding sites in distinct NH2- and COOH-terminal sequences of Raf-1 (13Fantl W.J. Muslin A.J. Kikuchi A. Martin J.A. MacNicol A.M. Gross R.W. Williams L.T. Nature. 1994; 371: 612-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 14Freed E. Symons M. Macdonald S.G. McCormick F.

Science. 1994; 266: 126-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). A 14-3-3 recognition consensus motif has been identified (27Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 889-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar), and Raf-1 contains two phosphorylation sites that fit the consensus sequence: serine 259 in the NH2-terminal regulatory sequence downstream of the Raf-CRD and serine 621 in the COOH-terminal kinase domain. However, disruption of the structural integrity of the Raf-CRD can abolish 14-3-3 interactions (26Michaud N.R. Fabian J.R. Mathes K.D. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3390-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), indicating that 14-3-3 binding sites distinct from this consensus motif may be present in the NH2 terminus of Raf-1. In fact, NH2-terminal fragments of Raf-1 that contain the Raf-CRD showed binding to 14-3-3 ζ by yeast two-hybrid studies (25Rommel C. Radziwill G. Lovric J. Noeldeke J. Heinicke T. Jones D. Aitken A. Moelling K. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 609-619PubMed Google Scholar). However, whether 14-3-3 proteins can interact directly with sequences in the Raf-CRD, and what role, if any, such an interaction may play in the regulation of Raf-1 function has not been established.In this report, we demonstrate that the isolated Raf-CRD binds directly to the ζ isoform of 14-3-3 and that mutations of residues 143–145 cause a loss of 14-3-3, but not Ras, binding in vitro. We also show that mutations that impair the 14-3-3/Raf-CRD association result in activation of Raf-1 transforming potential. Thus, 14-3-3 interaction with Raf-CRD may serve as a negative regulator of Raf-1 function. When taken together with our observation that Ras interaction with the Raf-CRD is essential for Ras transforming activity, we propose that Ras interaction with the Raf-CRD may disrupt the 14-3-3/Raf-CRD interaction to promote subsequent events that lead to full activation of Raf-1. Substantial genetic, biochemical, and biological evidence supports the critical role of the Raf-1 serine/threonine kinase as a key downstream effector of Ras signaling and transformation (1Williams N.G.

An additional complexity of Ras-mediated activation of Raf-1 is that the Ras/Raf-1 interaction is more convoluted than originally believed. We and others have shown recently that Ras interacts with two distinct Ras-binding domains in the NH2-terminal regulatory region of Raf-1 (18Brtva T.R. Drugan J.K. Ghosh S. Terrell R.S.

The first Ras-binding domain encompasses Raf-1 residues 55–131 (20Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar, 21Ghosh S.

This second binding region is contained within the Raf-1 cysteine-rich domain (residues 139–184, designated the Raf-CRD; also called Raf-Cys or Raf-C1) that resembles the C1 domains of protein kinase C family members (22Hurley, J. H., Newton, A. C., Parker, P. J., Blumberg, P. M., and Nishizuka, Y. (1997) Protein Sci., in press.Google Scholar). Although the precise role of this second Ras/Raf-1 interaction is unclear, we recently determined that Ras interaction with the Raf-CRD is required for Ras transforming activity (19Drugan J.K.

We hypothesized that Ras interaction with Raf-1 residues 55–131 promotes Raf-1 association with the plasma membrane while Ras interaction with the Raf-CRD stabilizes this membrane association and/or relieves the regulatory effects of the NH2 terminus. Hence, additional interactions between Ras and Raf-CRD may promote further activation events that could involve interactions with 14-3-3 proteins or phospholipids. 14-3-3 proteins bind directly with Raf-1 in vitro andin vivo (13Fantl W.J.

Biol. 1995; 15: 3390-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Moreover, there are conflicting reports regarding the relationship between the activated state of Raf-1 and its ability to bind 14-3-3 proteins (14Freed E. Symons M. Macdonald S.G. McCormick F. Ruggieri R. Science. 1994; 265: 1713-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 15Fu H. Xia K. Palla D.C. Cui C. Conroy K. Narsimhan R.P. Mamon H. Collier R.J. Roberts T.M.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 685-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Contradictory reports regarding the role of 14-3-3 proteins in Raf-1 activation may be due, in part, to the existence of multiple 14-3-3 binding sites in distinct NH2- and COOH-terminal sequences of Raf-1 (13Fantl W.J. Muslin A.J. Kikuchi A. Martin J.A. MacNicol A.M. Gross R.W. Williams L.T. Nature. 1994; 371: 612-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 14Freed E. Symons M. Macdonald S.G. McCormick F.

Science. 1994; 266: 126-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). A 14-3-3 recognition consensus motif has been identified (27Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 889-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar), and Raf-1 contains two phosphorylation sites that fit the consensus sequence: serine 259 in the NH2-terminal regulatory sequence downstream of the Raf-CRD and serine 621 in the COOH-terminal kinase domain. However, disruption of the structural integrity of the Raf-CRD can abolish 14-3-3 interactions (26Michaud N.R. Fabian J.R. Mathes K.D. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3390-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), indicating that 14-3-3 binding sites distinct from this consensus motif may be present in the NH2 terminus of Raf-1. In fact, NH2-terminal fragments of Raf-1 that contain the Raf-CRD showed binding to 14-3-3 ζ by yeast two-hybrid studies (25Rommel C. Radziwill G. Lovric J. Noeldeke J. Heinicke T. Jones D. Aitken A. Moelling K. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 609-619PubMed Google Scholar). However, whether 14-3-3 proteins can interact directly with sequences in the Raf-CRD, and what role, if any, such an interaction may play in the regulation of Raf-1 function has not been established. In this report, we demonstrate that the isolated Raf-CRD binds directly to the ζ isoform of 14-3-3 and that mutations of residues 143–145 cause a loss of 14-3-3, but not Ras, binding in vitro. We also show that mutations that impair the 14-3-3/Raf-CRD association result in activation of Raf-1 transforming potential. Thus, 14-3-3 interaction with Raf-CRD may serve as a negative regulator of Raf-1 function. When taken together with our observation that Ras interaction with the Raf-CRD is essential for Ras transforming activity, we propose that Ras interaction with the Raf-CRD may disrupt the 14-3-3/Raf-CRD interaction to promote subsequent events that lead to full activation of Raf-1.

Cysteines introduced into TM6 (L332C, F343C, G346C, and P350C) were oxidatively cross-linked to cysteines introduced into TM12 (L975C, M986C, G989C, and S993C, respectively). The pattern of cross-linking was consistent with a left-handed coiled coil arrangement of the two helices. To detect conformational changes between the helices during drug-stimulated ATPase activity, we tested the effects of substrates and ATP on cross-linking. Cyclosporin A, verapamil, vinblastine, and colchicine inhibited cross-linking of mutants F343C/M986C, G346C/G989C, and P350C/S993C. By contrast, ATP promoted cross-linking between only L332C/L975C. Enhanced cross-linking between L332C/L975C was due to ATP hydrolysis, since cross-linked product was not observed in the presence of ATP and vanadate, ADP, ADP and vanadate, or AMP-PNP. Cross-linking between P350C/S993C inhibited verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity by about 75%. Drug-stimulated ATPase activity, however, was fully restored in the presence of dithiothreitol. These results show that TM6 and TM12 undergo different conformational changes upon drug binding or during ATP hydrolysis, and that movement between these two helices is essential for drug-stimulated ATPase activity.

The photolabeling sites are closely associated with TM6 1The abbreviations used are: TM, transmembrane segment(s); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; AMP-PNP, adenyl-5′-yl imidophosphate; DTT, dithiothreitol.1The abbreviations used are: TM, transmembrane segment(s); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; AMP-PNP, adenyl-5′-yl imidophosphate; DTT, dithiothreitol. and TM12.TM6 and TM12 may be particularly important for drug transport because they directly connect the two transmembrane domains to their respective ATP-binding domains. Both transmembrane segments may interact and undergo essential conformational changes during drug-binding or during ATP hydrolysis. To test this hypothesis, we replaced the residues in TM6 and TM12 with cysteine and tested for the effect of drug substrates and ATP on the oxidative cross-linking between TM6 and TM12. The pattern of cross-linking was consistent with the TM6 and TM12 helices arranged as a left-handed coiled coil, and cross-linked pairs were affected differently by substrates or ATP. We also show that TM6 and TM12 must undergo conformational changes during drug-stimulated ATPase activity, since formation of a cross-link between TM6 and TM12 inhibited drug-stimulated ATPase activity. Activity could be restored by breaking the disulfide bond with dithiothreitol.DISCUSSIONThe results of cross-linking experiments suggest that TM6 and TM12 are close to each other along the entire lengths of the helices and are likely to exist in a left-handed coiled-coil arrangement. In this arrangement four of the six pairs of amino acids predicted to lie close to one another could be cross-linked. Cross-linking was not observed between F336C/S979C or L339C/V982C, even in the presence of ATP or drug substrates (data not shown). One possibility is that these residues are not close. Another possibility is that they are close, but in a nonreactive environment or that they are inaccessible to oxidant.Cross-linking was significantly influenced by the presence of ATP or drug substrates. ATP hydrolysis rather than nucleotide binding was responsible for cross-linking between L332C/L975C. In a previous study (22Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27482-27487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), we observed in intact cells that vinblastine or verapamil, but not colchicine, could inhibit cross-linking between these two residues. The observation that ATP hydrolysis promoted cross-linking between L332C/L975C suggests that inhibition of cross-linking of L332C/L975C in whole cells by verapamil or vinblastine occurred indirectly through depletion of intracellular ATP. Vinblastine and verapamil had a greater effect than colchicine since these two compounds are more efficient in stimulating the ATPase activity of P-glycoprotein, thereby depleting the ATP more rapidly.Drug substrates inhibited cross-linking of mutants F343C/M986C, G346C/G989C, and P350C/S993C. These residues either lie close to the binding site(s) for these substrates or drug-binding results in large conformational changes in TM6, TM12, or in both transmembrane segments. Conformational changes occurring globally in P-glycoprotein during substrate binding or during ATP hydrolysis have also been detected indirectly (21Liu R. Sharom F.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11865-11873Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 30Sonveaux N. Shapiro A.B. Goormaghtigh E. Ling V. Russychaert J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24617-24624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar).The results of this study show that there is “cross-talk” between the transmembrane domains and the ATP-binding domains of P-glycoprotein. ATP hydrolysis causes conformational changes in the transmembrane domains, while introduction of a cross-link between TM6 and TM12 inhibits drug-stimulated ATPase activity. Therefore, conformational changes occurring between TM6 and TM12 appear to be essential for coupling drug binding to stimulation of ATPase activity. A similar mechanism may exist in other ABC transporters.

The photolabeling sites are closely associated with TM6 1The abbreviations used are: TM, transmembrane segment(s); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; AMP-PNP, adenyl-5′-yl imidophosphate; DTT, dithiothreitol.1The abbreviations used are: TM, transmembrane segment(s); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; AMP-PNP, adenyl-5′-yl imidophosphate; DTT, dithiothreitol. and TM12. TM6 and TM12 may be particularly important for drug transport because they directly connect the two transmembrane domains to their respective ATP-binding domains. Both transmembrane segments may interact and undergo essential conformational changes during drug-binding or during ATP hydrolysis. To test this hypothesis, we replaced the residues in TM6 and TM12 with cysteine and tested for the effect of drug substrates and ATP on the oxidative cross-linking between TM6 and TM12. The pattern of cross-linking was consistent with the TM6 and TM12 helices arranged as a left-handed coiled coil, and cross-linked pairs were affected differently by substrates or ATP. We also show that TM6 and TM12 must undergo conformational changes during drug-stimulated ATPase activity, since formation of a cross-link between TM6 and TM12 inhibited drug-stimulated ATPase activity. Activity could be restored by breaking the disulfide bond with dithiothreitol. DISCUSSIONThe results of cross-linking experiments suggest that TM6 and TM12 are close to each other along the entire lengths of the helices and are likely to exist in a left-handed coiled-coil arrangement. In this arrangement four of the six pairs of amino acids predicted to lie close to one another could be cross-linked. Cross-linking was not observed between F336C/S979C or L339C/V982C, even in the presence of ATP or drug substrates (data not shown). One possibility is that these residues are not close. Another possibility is that they are close, but in a nonreactive environment or that they are inaccessible to oxidant.Cross-linking was significantly influenced by the presence of ATP or drug substrates. ATP hydrolysis rather than nucleotide binding was responsible for cross-linking between L332C/L975C. In a previous study (22Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27482-27487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), we observed in intact cells that vinblastine or verapamil, but not colchicine, could inhibit cross-linking between these two residues. The observation that ATP hydrolysis promoted cross-linking between L332C/L975C suggests that inhibition of cross-linking of L332C/L975C in whole cells by verapamil or vinblastine occurred indirectly through depletion of intracellular ATP. Vinblastine and verapamil had a greater effect than colchicine since these two compounds are more efficient in stimulating the ATPase activity of P-glycoprotein, thereby depleting the ATP more rapidly.Drug substrates inhibited cross-linking of mutants F343C/M986C, G346C/G989C, and P350C/S993C. These residues either lie close to the binding site(s) for these substrates or drug-binding results in large conformational changes in TM6, TM12, or in both transmembrane segments. Conformational changes occurring globally in P-glycoprotein during substrate binding or during ATP hydrolysis have also been detected indirectly (21Liu R. Sharom F.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11865-11873Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 30Sonveaux N. Shapiro A.B. Goormaghtigh E. Ling V. Russychaert J.-M. J. Biol.

ATP hydrolysis causes conformational changes in the transmembrane domains, while introduction of a cross-link between TM6 and TM12 inhibits drug-stimulated ATPase activity. Therefore, conformational changes occurring between TM6 and TM12 appear to be essential for coupling drug binding to stimulation of ATPase activity. A similar mechanism may exist in other ABC transporters.

However, the regulation of its synthesis in response to cell stimulation and its functional roles are still unclear. We examined the physiological relevance of cADPR to the messenger role in stimulation-secretion coupling in cultured bovine adrenal chromaffin cells. Sensitization of Ca2+-induced Ca2+release (CICR) and stimulation of catecholamine release by cADPR in permeabilized cells were demonstrated along with the contribution of CICR to intracellular Ca2+ dynamics and secretory response during stimulation of intact chromaffin cells. ADP-ribosyl cyclase was activated in the membrane preparation from chromaffin cells stimulated with acetylcholine (ACh), excess KCl depolarization, and 8-bromo-cyclic-AMP. ACh-induced activation of ADP-ribosyl cyclase was dependent on the influx of Ca2+ into cells and on the activation of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. These and previous findings that ACh activates adenylate cyclase by Ca2+ influx in chromaffin cells suggested that ACh induces activation of ADP-ribosyl cyclase through Ca2+ influx and cyclic AMP-mediated pathways. These results provide evidence that the synthesis of cADPR is regulated by cell stimulation, and the cADPR/CICR pathway forms a significant signal transduction for secretion.

Influx of Ca2+ through plasma membrane pathways and mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular stores by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), a second messenger derived from membrane phosphoinositide, are well documented mechanisms for increase in [Ca2+]i. Recent attention has been focused on another mechanism for mobilizing intracellular Ca2+: Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR), mediated by the ryanodine receptors. CICR mediates the amplification and propagation of initial Ca2+ signals, the generation of Ca2+oscillations, and the propagation of Ca2+ waves in certain types of cells. Depolarizing stimuli can activate release of Ca2+ from ryanodine-sensitive intracellular stores in a number of neuronal cells (1Simpson P.B. Challiss R.A.J. Nahorski S.R. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In cerebellar granule cells, a major component of both K+ depolarization- andN-methyl-d-aspartate-induced elevation of [Ca2+]i appears to be due to the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, evidence that suggests the importance of intracellular Ca2+ release via CICR (2Simpson P.B. Challiss R.A.J. Nahorski S.R. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Galione et al. (3Galione A. Lee H.C. Busa W.B. Science. 1991; 253: 1143-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar) recently identified a novel Ca2+ mobilizing agent that is a cyclic metabolite of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR). This agent is as potent as IP3 in mobilizing Ca2+ in sea urchin eggs and mediates the fertilization-induced Ca2+ wave in these eggs (3Galione A. Lee H.C. Busa W.B.

Immunol. 1995; 155: 3353-3359PubMed Google Scholar). cADPR has been shown to activate the cardiac but not the skeletal isoforms of the ryanodine receptor Ca2+ channel and could be a candidate for a nonskeletal type ryanodine receptor endogenous messenger (8Mészáros L.G. Bak J. Chu A. Nature. 1993; 364: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). If cADPR plays a role as a second messenger of CICR, it is necessary to demonstrate that its intracellular levels are under the control of extracellular stimuli. Recently, Takasawa et al. (7Takasawa S. Nata K. Yonekura H. Okamoto H. Science. 1993; 259: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) suggested that cADPR is generated in pancreatic islets by glucose stimulation, serving as a second messenger for Ca2+mobilization and insulin release. However, little evidence is available in this regard for various cell types. In addition, recent studies using type 2 cardiac ryanodine receptors incorporated into planar lipid bilayers have shown the inability of cADPR to cause Ca2+release in the presence of physiological concentrations of ATP, indicating that cADPR is unlikely to be a second messenger for CICRin vivo (19Sitsapesan R.

Brown D.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 482: 317-323Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar) suggest another role of cADPR, that it may mediate the muscarinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor-induced inhibition of M-type K+ currents in NG108–15. Therefore, the physiological relevance of cADPR remains unclear. Adrenal medullary chromaffin cells are widely used as a model for the analysis of endocrine and neuronal cell functions. Caffeine is well known for inducing a large increase in [Ca2+]i levels through the mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular Ca2+ stores by stimulating CICR in adrenal chromaffin cells. Spontaneous [Ca2+]i fluctuations in rat chromaffin cells are generated by caffeine (22Malgaroli A. Fesce R. Meldolesi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3005-3008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus the presence of a ryanodine-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ store is suggested. Here, we demonstrate the ability of cADPR to cause Ca2+release and the activation of cADPR synthesis in response to stimuli in bovine adrenal chromaffin cells, the results suggesting that the Ca2+ mobilizing pathway mediated by cADPR may participate in physiological stimulation-induced secretory response of the cells.

Chromaffin cells of bovine adrenal glands were isolated enzymatically according to the procedure described by Fenwick et al. (23Fenwick E.M. Fajdiga P.B. Home N.B.S. Livett B.G. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 76: 12-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), with some modifications (24Morita K. Dohi T. Kitayama S. Koyama Y. Tsujimoto A. J.

Cell Signal. 1995; 11: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin G (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), ascorbate (0.1 mm), and HEPES (5 mm) for 24–72 h at 37 °C under 5% CO2, 95% air as suspension culture for measurements of Ca2+release and [Ca2+]i or as monolayer culture on 35–100-mm tissue culture dish (5 × 105 cells/ml) for 2–5 days for catecholamine (CA) release assay. Cells were washed and suspended before use in a medium containing NaCl (150 mm), KCl (5 mm), MgSO4 (1 mm), CaCl2 (1.3 mm), glucose (5 mm), HEPES-Tris buffer (10 mm), and bovine serum albumin 0.5%, pH 7.4. For measurement of Ca2+ release from digitonin-permeabilized chromaffin cells, cells were washed and suspended in potassium glutamate buffer (145 mm potassium glutamate, 20 mm PIPES, 1 mm EGTA, pH 6.6) containing an ATP generating system (2 mmMg2+-ATP, 5 mm creatine phosphate, 40 units/ml creatine phosphokinase) and protease inhibitors (2.5 mmbenzamidine, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 50 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor) and then given permeabilization by incubating cells with digitonin (20 μm) for 5 min at 25 °C. The cells were washed and resuspended (107 cells/ml) in an intracellular medium (KH medium: 140 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.0) containing an ATP generating system, protease inhibitors, mitochondrial inhibitors (10 μg/ml antimycin A, 10 μg/ml oligomycin, and 10 mmNaN3), and 0.025% bovine serum albumin. The permeabilization was checked by measuring the leakage of lactate dehydrogenase. One milliliter of cell suspension was transferred to a fluorescence cuvette and supplemented with fura-2 (1 μm). Fluorescence was continuously monitored using a fluorometer at an excitation of 340/380 nm and an emission of 510 nm. Increase in Ca2+ concentration in the medium was calibrated by the addition of known amounts of Ca2+ and expressed as Ca2+ release in the text. For the measurement of [Ca2+]i, cells were incubated at 32 °C with 1 μm fura-2 AM for 30 min in order to load the dye. Cells were then centrifuged at 15 × g for 10 min and resuspended to yield 3 × 106 cells/ml. Fluorescence was measured using a dual-wavelength, fluorescence spectrophotometric mode with an excitation of 340 and 380 nm and an emission of 510 nm. [Ca2+]i was calculated from the fluorescent ratio at 340 and 380 nm using the equation of Grynkiewiczet al. (26Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and a value of 224 nm for theKd of fura-2. For assaying 45Ca2+ release, a monolayer culture of chromaffin cells was preincubated in the full culture medium containing 45CaCl2 (185 kBq/ml) for 24–48 h in the CO2 incubator. Then cells were washed and permeabilized as described above. After a 1-min preincubation in a KH medium containing an ATP generating system, protease inhibitors, mitochondrial inhibitors, and 1 mm EGTA at 32 °C, cells were incubated in various conditions. The medium was then immediately separated from the cells, and the 45Ca2+ released into the medium was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. For measurement of CA release from permeabilized chromaffin cells, a monolayer culture of chromaffin cells was permeabilized as described above, preincubated for 1 min in a KH medium containing an ATP generating system, protease inhibitors, and mitochondrial inhibitors with or without 1 mm EGTA, and then incubated for 20 min with cADPR or IP3. After the period of incubation, the medium was separated from the cells and used for the CA assay. For this experiment, the KH medium was treated with Calcium SpongeTM S before use to reduce the background of CA released due to contaminated Ca2+ in the medium. Various concentrations of Ca2+ in the medium were made by a Ca2+-EGTA buffer, and the free Ca2+concentrations were measured using a selective Ca2+minielectrode or specific dye indicators, fura-2 and fluo 3. Perchloric acid (5% of final concentration) was added to the incubation medium, which was then centrifuged at 4,500 × g for 15 min. 0.2 ml of the clear supernatant was diluted 20-fold with 3m acetate buffer to create an appropriate concentration of CA and to adjust the pH to 6.2. Total CA in the medium was determined fluorometrically by the trihydroxyindole method (27von Euler U.S. Lishajko F. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1961; 51: 348-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar), with adrenaline serving as a standard. CA release from intact chromaffin cells was performed as described previously (24Morita K. Dohi T. Kitayama S. Koyama Y. Tsujimoto A. J. Neurochem. 1987; 48: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 25Morita K. Suemitsu T. Uchiyama Y. Miyasako T. Dohi T. J. Lipid Mediat. Cell Signal. 1995; 11: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Cultured chromaffin cells were incubated in various conditions and then washed rapidly twice with 10 ml of chilled buffer containing 0.34 m glucose, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, and immersed in liquid N2. Cells were homogenized in the buffer using Polytron for 20 s followed by six strokes with a Thomas homogenizer equipped with Teflon pestle. The homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 × gfor 30 min at 0 °C. The resulting pellet was suspended in the same buffer as a membrane fraction. The homogenate and membrane fraction were then used for assays of enzyme activity and protein concentration. ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity was determined by measuring the production of cADPR from [32P]NAD+ as substrate. An assay mixture containing 10 μl of enzyme preparation, 40 μl of 250 μm [32P]NAD+ (37 kBq), 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, and 0.1% Triton X-100 was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The resulting [32P]cADPR was separated from substrate and metabolites by selective hydrolysis with snake venom phosphodiesterase 1 followed by purification with dihydroxyboronyl Bio-Rex 70 (DHB Bio-Rex 70) column chromatography according to the reported procedure (28Kim H. Jacobson E.L. Jacobson M.K. Science. 1993; 261: 1330-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In brief, the reaction mixture was treated with snake venom phosphodiesterase 1 (0.3 unit), diluted with ammonium formate buffer, pH 9.0, and applied to a DHB Bio-Rex 70 column. After washing the column with the above buffer, [32P]cADPR was eluted with 5 ml of deionized water and quantified by liquid scintillation counting to estimate cyclase activity. Eighty ml of eluant from the DHB Bio-Rex 70 column was neutralized, freeze-dried, and then dissolved with 200 μl of deionized water. Further analysis of the sample by HPLC was performed using a TSKgel QAE-2SW column (0.46 × 25 cm) and TSKgel ODS-80Ts column (0.46 × 15 cm) connected in tandem. Elution was performed with 0.25 m ammonium formate buffer, pH 4.0, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min and monitored by the absorbance at 260 nm. One-ml fractions were assayed for determination of Ca2+ release activity as described above and for radioactivity. The activity of ADP-ribosyl cyclase was also determined by measuring cyclic GDP-ribose (cGDPR) fluorometrically using NGD+ as a substrate (29Graeff R.M. Walseth T.F. Fryxell K. Branton W.D. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30260-30267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). cGDPR is resistant to hydrolysis so this procedure was demonstrated to be highly sensitive and convenient for ADP-ribosyl cyclase-like enzymes such as CD38 (29Graeff R.M. Walseth T.F. Fryxell K. Branton W.D. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30260-30267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures containing 60 μm NGD+, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and homogenate and membranes of chromaffin cells (0.8 mg of protein/ml) were maintained at 37 °C for 1 h to continuously monitor the fluorescence of cGDPR on a Hitachi 850 spectrophotometer at excitation/emission wavelengths of 300/410 nm. The fluorescence intensity was calibrated and converted to molar concentration by use of authentic cGDPR. NGD+ was HPLC-purified according to the procedure of Graeff et al. (29Graeff R.M. Walseth T.F. Fryxell K. Branton W.D. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30260-30267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The hydrolase activity was determined using 200 μm [3H]cADPR (7.4 kBq) as a substrate as reported (28Kim H. Jacobson E.L. Jacobson M.K. Science. 1993; 261: 1330-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). ADPR, the product of cADPR was first converted to AMP by treatment with phosphodiesterase, and the AMP was separated on the DHB Bio-Rex 70 column. The flow-through and wash fractions (4 ml) were combined, and [3H]AMP was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Statistical analyses were performed with the Student's t test. cADPR stimulated Ca2+ release in a concentration-dependent manner from permeabilized chromaffin cells with larger maximal response and lower affinity than that induced by IP3 (Fig. 1 A). In the presence of 1 μm IP3, in which IP3 caused the maximal release, additional 1 μm IP3 caused no further increase in Ca2+ release, whereas cADPR brought about further increase in the release. As cADPR may induce Ca2+ release by different mechanisms than that induced by IP3, we first examined the pharmacological characteristics of cADPR-induced Ca2+ release in chromaffin cells. Phosphorylation of the ryanodine receptor by calmodulin-dependent protein kinase has been reported for sarcoplasmic reticulum from cardiac muscle (30Witcher D.R. Kovacs R.J. Schulman H. Cefali D.C.

In the present study, 8-bromo-cyclic-AMP (8-Br-cAMP) potentiated both cADPR- and IP3-induced Ca2+ release; calmodulin potentiated cADPR-induced release but did not affect IP3-induced release (Fig. 1 B). The catalytic subunit of A-PK (A-PK C.S.) potentiated cADPR- and IP3-induced Ca2+ release, and the potentiating effects of an A-PK C.S. were blocked by the A-PK inhibitor (Table I). 8-Bromo-cyclic-GMP (8-Br-cGMP) was without effect (data not shown). A calmodulin antagonist, W-7, reduced cADPR-induced release and blocked the potentiations by calmodulin of cADPR- and caffeine-induced Ca2+ release.

Heparin, CsCl, and tetraethylammonium, known inhibitors of IP3-induced Ca2+ release, all inhibited IP3-induced Ca2+ release in this experiment also but had no effect on cADPR-induced Ca2+ release. A classical inhibitor of ryanodine receptors, benzocaine, and a novel inhibitor, imperatoxin inhibitor (IpTxi), which has been purified from scorpion venom and shown to specifically block ryanodine receptors of skeletal and cardiac muscle (36Valdivia H.H. Kirby M.S. Lederer W.J. Coronado R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12185-12189Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), both, inhibited cADPR- but not IP3-induced release. Caffeine potentiated the effect of cADPR, and cADPR greatly potentiated caffeine-induced release. Such cross-potentiation was not observed between IP3 and cADPR or caffeine. Thapsigargin, shown to specifically block the endoplasmic reticulum but not muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, inhibits Ca2+ uptake into endoplasmic reticulum and then empties Ca2+ in the stores (37Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (3009) Google Scholar). In cells pretreated with 20 nm thapsigargin, IP3 failed to increase Ca2+ release. cADPR- and caffeine-induced Ca2+release were only blocked by higher concentrations of thapsigargin (Fig. 2). The concentration-response relationship of thapsigargin-induced inhibition shows that Ca2+ release in response to IP3 is more sensitive to the inhibition than to cADPR. Taken together, these results may suggest that cADPR and caffeine act on the same Ca2+ release mechanism from the same stores, which are different from IP3-sensitive stores, and support the hypothesis that cADPR may work through a Ca2+ release system similar to the CICR system in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. A number of studies on cADPR-induced Ca2+ release from sea urchin eggs have shown that the actions of ryanodine and caffeine are similar to those of cADPR (4Galione A. White A. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 431-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 38Lee H.C. Galione A. Walseth T.F. Vitam. Horm. 1994; 48: 199-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Therefore, the ability of cADPR to sensitize CICR was examined by measuring Ca2+-induced45Ca2+ release. Fig. 3 shows the effects of cADPR and caffeine on 45Ca2+ release from digitonin-permeabilized cells that had been prelabeled with 45CaCl2. cADPR stimulated 45Ca2+ release, with the peak effect occurring 10 s after the addition of cADPR. The effect of cADPR was transient in comparison with the long lasting release of45Ca2+ induced by caffeine. cADPR and caffeine markedly enhanced 45Ca2+ release induced by low concentrations of Ca2+ but did not modify the maximal Ca2+-induced 45Ca2+ release. Increases in the concentration of Ca2+ in the medium from 0.02 μm to a peak effect of 3 μm stimulated release of CA in digitonin-permeabilized chromaffin cells (Fig. 4 A). The Ca2+-induced CA release was not inhibited by IpTxi. In this cell preparation, cADPR (1 μm) caused an increase in CA release, and the effect of cADPR was blocked by EGTA and IpTxi (Fig. 4 B). These results show the ability of cADPR to induce CA release via Ca2+ release through ryanodine receptor Ca2+ channel. To ascertain whether cADPR was a physiological mes"

The Rb family of proteins, consisting of pRb, p107, and pRb2/p130, has also been shown to monitor progression of G1 phase, mostly through their interaction with E2F family members. p107 is able to inhibit Cdk2 kinase activity through this interaction via a p21-related domain present in the C terminus of the protein. We show here that pRb2/p130 also possesses this activity, but through a separate domain. Moreover, we correlate the increased expression of pRb2/p130 during various cellular processes with the decreased kinase activity of Cdk2. We hypothesize that pRb2/p130 may act not only to bind and modify E2F activity, but also to inhibit Cdk2 kinase activity in concert with p21 in a manner different from p107.

The mammalian cell cycle is presently thought to be driven by the sequential activation and deactivation of various cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) pairs (1MacLachlan T.K. Sang N. Giordano A. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1995; 5: 127-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The prototypic cell cycle kinase, Cdc2, was originally discovered in yeast and found to be involved in regulating both DNA replication and mitosis. Higher organisms however were found to possess a more complex system monitoring these events. One of the several kinases involved, cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2), is necessary for mammalian cells to pass the restriction point and onto DNA replication (2Elledge S.J. Spottswood M.R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2653-2659Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Activation and deactivation of this kinase is critical to the precise timing of the onset of S phase, after which a cell is committed to divide. Temporal association with cyclins A or E depicts when the kinase will be active and therefore phosphorylates the substrates involved in DNA replication. Over the last few years, several mechanisms besides cyclin binding have been discovered that control Cdk activity. In addition to differences in phosphorylation status and cofactor binding, a growing number of low molecular weight proteins are now known to bind to and inhibit Cdk kinase activity (3Xiong Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1288: 1-5Google Scholar, 4Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar). The CIP/KIP family (p21, p27, p57) and the INK family (p15, p16, p18, p19) of Cdk inhibitors either bind the cyclin or bind directly to the Cdk and suppress its kinase activities until cell cycle progression may continue. The INK family has a specificity for the early G1kinases Cdk4 and Cdk6 complexed with d-type cyclins, while the CIP family is partial to Cdk2 bound to either cyclin A or E. When overexpressed in a variety of cell types, these inhibitors are able to halt growth and arrest the cells in G1 phase. These are therefore temporally regulated proteins, with a preference for potently inhibiting G1 cyclin-Cdk pairs. Expectedly, the loss of some of these proteins has been found to be a critical step in oncogenesis. The p16 and p15 genes both lie in a region found deleted in some 75% of all melanoma cases (5Kamb A. Gruis N.A. Weaver-Feldhaus J. Liu Q. Harshman K. Tavtigian S.V. Stockert E. Day 3rd, R.S. Johnson B.E. Skolnick M.H. Science. 1994; 264: 436-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (2820) Google Scholar, 6Nobori T. Miura K. Wu D.J. Lois A. Takabayashi K. Carson D.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 753-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1723) Google Scholar). It appears that Cdk inhibition is essential for normal cell cycle progression. Downstream from p16 and p15 Cdk inhibition is the activation of the pRb protein, another critical watchdog of G1 cell cycle advancement (7Paggi M.G. Baldi A. Bonetto F. Giordano A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 62: 418-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The Rb protein is most well known for its interaction with and inhibition of the E2F transcription factor. It is thought that E2F is able to transactivate several genes whose products are necessary for DNA replication to occur. However, bound to pRb, this transactivating ability is lost (8Chellappan S.P. Hiebert S. Mudryj M. Horowitz J.M. Nevins J.R. Cell. 1991; 65: 1053-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). pRb is also found lost in several types of cancers, including its namesake, retinoblastoma. The Rb-related proteins p107 and pRb2/p130 have been found to have similar, yet distinctive, qualities from their founding member (9Ewen M.E. Xing Y.G. Lawrence J.B. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1991; 66: 1155-1164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 10Mayol X. Graña X. Baldi A. Sang N. Hu Q. Giordano A Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2561-2566PubMed Google Scholar, 11Li Y.

Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2378-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). pRb2/p130 binds an E2F-related protein, E2F5, in G0 phase of the cell cycle, possibly to retain the cell in a quiescent or terminally differentiated form. If the cell is induced to enter the cell cycle, association of pRb2/p130 with E2F family members quickly switches from E2F5 to E2F4 (13Sardet C. Vidal M. Cobrinik D. Geng Y. Onufryk C. Chen A. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2403-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 14Buck V. Allen K.E. Sorensen T. Bybee A. Hijmans E.M. Voorhoeve P.M. Bernards R. La Thangue N.B. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 31-38PubMed Google Scholar). Early in G1 phase, E2F4 switches from pRb2/p130 to p107 and remains until late in G1. The effects of these associations on the activity of E2F4 and -5, however, are not known. Divergent in its similarities to pRb, pRb2/p130, and p107 are able to stably bind cyclin-Cdk complexes. Both pRb2/p130 and p107 coprecipitate with cyclins E and A and Cdk2 (15Claudio P.P. De Luca A. Howard C.M. Baldi A. Firpo E.J. Koff A. Paggi M.G. Giordano A. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2003-2008PubMed Google Scholar). pRb2/p130 possesses a kinase activity reminiscent of cyclin A-Cdk2, suggesting that the protein travels in concert with the kinase. However, association of pRb2/p130 with cyclin A occurs prior to the known activation of cyclin protein kinase A. The amino terminus of p107 in particular is the associative region with cyclin-Cdks and is able to inhibit the kinase activities of these complexes. It is through this p21-related motif that it is able to bind cyclin-Cdk2 complexes, inhibit their kinase activity, and halt growth of cells (16Zhu L. Harlow E. Dynlacht B.D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1740-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 17Zhu L. Enders G. Lees J.A. Beijersbergen R.L. Bernards R. Harlow E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1904-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Exemplifying this difference between pRb and p107, a p107 mutant that is unable to bind E2F factors is able to arrest growth of a cell line that is resistant to pRb growth suppression. We show here that pRb2/p130 is also able to inhibit Cdk2 kinase activity in a manner similar yet distinct from p107. Although both proteins are known to stably bind these complexes, pRb2/p130 does so from a separate domain, the spacer region. We also find that pRb2/p130 protein levels are increased upon differentiation of myocytes, coincident with Cdk2 kinase inhibition, where p107 protein levels have been shown previously to decrease. These results suggest that pRb2/p130 may act not only to bind and modify E2F activity, but also to inhibit Cdk2 kinase activity in concert with p21. We used a prokaryotic expression vector pGEX-2T (Stratagene) and the polymerase chain reaction to generate chimeric glutathione S-transferase. The primers used to amplify the polymerase chain reaction fragments that were subcloned in the pGEX-2T were derived from the 5′ and 3′ ends of the NH2, A, Spacer, B, and COOH domain of pRb2/p130 and the Spacer domain of pRb and p107. The pGEX-2T fusion proteins generated are shown in Fig. 2. XL1-Blue bacteria carrying pGEX-2T vectors were grown to midlog phase then induced to express protein by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to the media to 0.25 mm. The cultures were then shaken for 4 h. Bacteria were then pelleted and resuspended in NENT buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). Cell suspensions were sonicated and pelleted, and the supernatant was collected. The remaining bacteria were then resuspended in NENT + 2% N-lauroylsarcosine and pelleted, and the supernatant was again collected. The combined supernatants were incubated with glutathione-agarose (Pharmacia) overnight at 4°C. The agarose was then pelleted and washed three times in NENT buffer. Cell lysates were prepared by resuspending pelleted cells in 200 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 5 mm EDTA, 250 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 0.1% Triton, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, plus protease inhibitors). 50 μg of protein were run on a 7% polyacrylamide gel. Proteins within the polyacrylamide gel were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) in CAPS buffer (10 mm CAPS, 20% methanol, pH 11). The membrane was blocked with 5% milk in TBS-T buffer (2 mm Tris, 13.7 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.6) and then washed in TBS-T. Primary antibody was incubated with the membrane in 3% milk and then washed in TBS-T. The membrane was then incubated with anti-rabbit Ig coupled with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham) and washed in TBS-T. The presence of secondary antibody bound to the membrane was detected using the ECL system (NEN Life Sciences). Cell lysates were prepared by resuspending pelleted cells in 200 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 5 mm EDTA, 250 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 0.1% Triton, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, plus protease inhibitors). An equal amount of protein for each fraction was immunoprecipitated with a specific antibody. Prior to detecting the presence of histone H1 kinase activity, each sample was incubated with an equal amount of the pGEX-2T constructs previously described for 30 min at 4°C. Protein kinase assays were performed as described (18Giordano A. Lee J.H. Scheppler J.A. Herrmann C. Harlow E. Deuschle U. Beach D. Franza Jr., B.R. Science. 1991; 253: 1271-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Kinase assays were repeated at least three times giving an interassay standard deviation within 10% after normalization for protein amount. pRb2/p130 has been shown to be a pocket protein that may be functionally specific for G0 phase of the cell cycle. In part by interacting with E2F5 and E2F4, pRb2/p130 holds cells in a quiescent or differentiated state. Since pRb2/p130 has also been shown to bind cyclins, we sought to find whether an increase in pRb2/p130 protein coincides with an alteration of associated Cdk activity. Certain models have suggested that there is an inverse relationship between these two phenomena. ML1 myeloma cells when undergoing differentiation in vitro show a marked increase in pRb2/p130 protein by terminal differentiation, while associated Cdk2 kinase activity decreases to basal levels. 2D. Leibermann, personal communication. The murine hematopoietic progenitor cell line FDC-P1 displays a high amount of pRb2/p130 in early G1 phase which is coupled to a decrease in associated Cdk2 histone H1 kinase activity. As protein levels decline in late G1, kinase activity is restored to Cdk2 (19van Wijnen, A. J., Cooper, C., Odgren, P., Aziz, F., De Luca, A., Shakoori, R. A., Giordano, A., Quesonberry, P. J., Lian, J. B., Stein G. S., and Stein, J. L. (1997) J. Cell. Biochem., in press.Google Scholar). In this study we have focused on the myoblast cell line, C2C12. When cultured in medium containing 2% horse serum, C2C12 cells undergo cell cycle arrest, fuse with neighboring cells, and elongate into fully differentiated, multinucleated muscle fibers. After 5 days in this differentiation medium, cells had obtained a complete myotubular morphology. Immunoblotting of protein extracts from 24-h time points of these cells shows an increase of more than twice the amount of pRb2/p130 protein (Fig. 1 A). pRb2/p130 complexes were also immunoprecipitated from these extracts and subjected to a kinase assay using histone H1 as substrate to asses associated Cdk2 activity. Cdk2 kinase activity decreased more than half by the end of the differentiation pathway (Fig. 1 B). To confirm that the protein levels of Cdk2 were equal in all samples which underwent kinase analysis, half of the immunoprecipitated samples were assessed for Cdk2 levels by immunoblotting (Fig. 1 A). Previous studies have shown that p107 protein decreases during muscle differentiation (20Kiess M. Gill R.M. Hamel P.A. Cell Growth Diff. 1995; 6: 1287-1298PubMed Google Scholar). pRb2/p130 therefore may differ in its functional similarities to p107 with respect to binding cell cycle machinery. These results taken together show concomitantly that as pRb2/p130 protein levels increase, associated Cdk2 activity decreases, suggesting that pRb2/p130 may play a role in inhibiting the activity of this kinase. Since there is a correlation of pRb2/p130 protein levels and Cdk2 kinase activity, we sought to determine whether pRb2/p130 can directly inhibit Cdk2. A panel of mutants, representing different regions of pRb2/p130, p107, and pRb as control, were developed and expressed as GST-fusion proteins (Fig. 2). Cdk2 complexes were immunoprecipitated from lysates of exponentially growing ML1 myeloma cells, and to the precipitates was added 20 μg of the indicated GST-fusion protein. The mixtures were then subjected to a kinase assay using histone H1 as substrate. The A and B domains of the pocket and C-terminal regions of pRb2/p130 had little or no effect on the kinase activity of Cdk2 compared with precipitates treated with GST alone, and the N terminus had a moderate inhibitory activity. However, the spacer region, whose amino acid sequence is specific to pRb2/p130, decreased Cdk2-dependent histone phosphorylation dramatically (Fig. 3 A). The spacer region's effect on Cdk2 activity was found to be dose-dependent (Fig. 3 B). This was unexpected as although pRb2/p130 and p107 share many structural and functional qualities such as common binding partners E2F4, Cdk2, and cyclins A and E, pRb2/p130 differs in its inhibitory affect on Cdk2. As opposed to pRb2/p130, the N-terminal region of p107, containing a p21CIP1-like motif, is responsible for this activity. Nucleotide homology analysis of the N terminus of pRb2/p130 reveals a similar region of identity with p21CIP1 (data not shown); however, as is shown in Fig. 3 A, this is not able to inhibit Cdk2 kinase activity as strongly as the spacer region. To determine if this inhibitory region is conserved in only pRb2/p130, spacer regions from all Rb protein family members were expressed as GST-fusion proteins and added in large excess to kinase assays of Cdk2. Only pRb2/p130 was able to inhibit Cdk2 kinase activity significantly through this region; therefore pRb2/p130 is unique in this ability (Fig. 4). Finally, to determine if this inhibition is a generality found with all Cdc2-family members, Cdc2, Cdk2, Cdk4, and Cdk5 were immunoprecipitated from ML1 cells and were subjected to a kinase assay using either histone H1 or Rb as substrate (Fig. 5). The spacer region of pRb2/p130 was only able to decrease Cdk2 kinase activity, demonstrating that the inhibitory activity associated with pRb2/p130 is specific for the kinase that it is able to bind stably in cells, Cdk2.Figure 5Various Cdk kinase activities after the addition of the Rb2/p130 spacer region GST-fusion protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The possibility of pRb2/p130 acting as a Cdk2 kinase inhibitor raises the notion that Cdks may be negatively controlled by a variety of mechanisms, including phosphorylation and known Cdk inhibitor binding. It has been demonstrated that the pRb2/p130 gene product is a nuclear protein whose phosphorylation is cell cycle-regulated (21Baldi A. De Luca A. Claudio P.P. Baldi F. Giordano G.G. Tommasino M. Paggi M. Giordano A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 59: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Previous reports suggest that pRb2/p130 may primarily act in early G1 phase, shown by its association with the G0-specific transcription factor E2F5 and high expression in differentiated or quiescent cells. In addition to potential modification of E2F protein functions, pRb2/p130 may also contribute to G0/G1 arrest by decreasing the activity of kinases that may allow the cell to enter S phase. The highly homologous p107 protein has also been shown to have this effect on Cdk2. However, we feel that the effect we see of pRb2/p130 on Cdk2 differs in three respects. One, as p107 is added in increasing amounts to Cdk2 kinase assays, pRb and histone H1 substrates decrease in phosphorylation, while p107 itself becomes increasingly phosphorylated. This suggests that p107 acts more like a preferential substrate, not an inhibitor. pRb2/p130 does not become phosphorylated in our in vitroassays (data not shown), therefore not acting as an alternative substrate, but as a binding protein with inhibitory properties. Second, the region of pRb2/p130 that displays the most dramatic effect is one that is poorly conserved between the two proteins. The Rb family of proteins may functionally diverge through this region of low homology, and this might be one of those functions. Finally, it has been stated that p107 may not act so much as a true Cdk inhibitor, but simply masks Cdk2/cyclin A from its substrate, E2F4. We propose that pRb2/p130 acts differently since the spacer region is very close to the predicted E2F binding site, the C terminus, and that pRb2/p130 seems to increase at times of Cdk2 inhibition in vivo, whereas p107 does not. In conclusion, we have shown that a unique domain of the pRb2/p130 protein is able to inhibit Cdk2 kinase activity in vitro, and that in model in vivo systems, pRb2/p130 protein increases are coincident with Cdk2 inhibition, suggesting that pRb2/p130 may not only act to regulate E2F activity, but also kinase activity as well. We express our gratitude to M. G. Paggi for his continuous support."

Arg-315, Ser-358, Val-379, and Gly-473 are highly conserved residues in transglutaminases while Arg-687 and Δ679–696 are not. All mutations strongly decreased transglutaminase activity and protein levels. The mutation R127Stop diminished the amount of mRNA. Structural analysis of these mutations based on the factor XIII A-subunit crystal structure demonstrated that Arg-315, Ser-358, Val-379, and Gly-473 are located in the catalytic core domain, and Arg-687 and the deletion are in the β-barrel domains. The side chains of amino acids Arg-315, Ser-358, and Gly-473 make ionic and hydrogen bonds important for folding and structural stability of the enzyme but are not directly involved in catalysis. Val-379 is two amino acids away from the active site cysteine, and its change into leucine disturbs the active site structure. The decreased activity and protein level after expression of the R687C and Δ679–696 TGK cDNA in TGK negative keratinocytes excluded that they are polymorphisms. These results identify important amino acids in the central core domain of transglutaminases and show that the C-terminal end influences the structural and functional integrity of TGK.

Autosomal recessive lamellar ichthyosis (LI) (Mendelian Inheritance in Man No. 242100, 242300) is a severe congenital scaling skin disorder with a frequency of about 1:250,000 (28Traupe H.

The clinical phenotype is heterogeneous and can range from generalized large brownish plate-like scales with no erythroderma to fine white scales with underlying erythroderma. Moreover, patients may have palmar and plantar hyperkeratosis, scarring alopecia, ectropion, eclabium, and decreased sweating. Patients are often born encased in a shiny, thick parchment-like membrane (collodion baby). By electron microscopy, five types of lamellar ichthyosis (ichthyosis congenita type I-V) have been distinguished (30Anton-Lamprecht I. Papadimetriou J.M. Henderson D.W. Spaniolo D.V. The skin. Churchill-Livingston, London1992: 459-550Google Scholar). Deleterious mutations in the TGK gene have been reported in lamellar ichthyosis patients providing compelling evidence for the importance of the cornified cell envelope for epidermal homeostasis and the barrier function of the skin (31Parmentier L.

However, biochemical data clearly showed that about 50–60% of LI patients have normal TG activity (34Huber M. Rettler I. Bernasconi K. Wyss M. Hohl D. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 105: 653-654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Genetic heterogeneity is further supported by genetic mapping studies identifying two other disease-causing genes, one on chromosome 2q33–35 and another at a currently unknown location (35Parmentier L.

We report seven novel TGK mutations found in LI patients. The consequences of these mutations (five missense mutations, one premature stop codon, and a deletion of 18 amino acids) on the biosynthesis of TGK mRNA and protein are described. The effects of these mutations on folding and structure are analyzed using the three-dimensional structure of factor XIII A-subunit as model. This study identifies structurally and functionally important amino acids of TGK and provides new insight into the structure-function relationship in transglutaminases. Families from Switzerland (LI-8), Holland (LI-11), Sweden (LI-20), and the United States (LI-22) were investigated (see Fig. 1). The proband of family LI-8 was born as a collodion baby and died shortly after birth due to bacterial infection. The affected individual of family LI-11 was not born as a collodion baby; his trunk and neck are covered with large plate-like yellow-brown hyperkeratotic scales, and he has very extensive palmar-plantar keratoderma with large fissures. The face is not involved and there is no alopecia or ectropion. The clinical data of the affected members of family LI-20 have been described earlier (36Rossmann-Ringdahl I. Anton-Lamprecht I. Swanbeck G. Arch. Dermatol. 1986; 122: 559-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Patient IV.4 of LI-22 (see Fig. 1) was born as a collodion baby after a normal, full-term pregnancy. He now has generalized, thin white to brown scales that are more plate-like on the scalp and the lower extremities. No blistering or significant erythroderma are apparent. Palms and soles show moderate hyperkeratosis. Patient II.2 of LI-22 (Fig. 1) was not born as a collodion baby and now has thick scales on the scalp, powdery fine scaling on the back and arms, and hyperlinear palms. The affected members of family LI-22 had normal cholesterol sulfate and cholesterol sulfatase levels. Punch biopsies obtained from the probands were used to establish primary cultures on lethally irradiated murine 3T3 fibroblasts as described earlier (37Rheinwald J.G. Green H.

Secondary cultures were grown in high calcium keratinocyte medium, 10% fetal calf serum until confluency. After an additional 5 days in culture, genomic DNA, RNA, and proteins for measuring transglutaminase activity and immunoblotting were extracted as described below. Genomic DNA was purified from cultured cells by phenol/chloroform extraction as described earlier (40Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed.

Cells were lysed by sonication in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The supernatant, after centrifugation at 25,000 ×g at 4 °C for 30 min, was used as cytosolic fraction. The cell pellet was re-extracted by sonication with the same buffer supplemented with 1% Triton X-100. After incubation for 10 min at 37 °C, the lysate was centrifuged again, and the supernatant (membrane fraction) was collected for measuring the transglutaminase activity (43Lichti U. Ben T.

Transglutaminase activity is expressed as pmol of3H-putrescine incorporated into dimethylcaseine per hour and per mg of protein. Results are indicated as mean ± S.E. in cell extracts from at least two different cell passages, each measured in duplicate.

Atomic coordinates for the factor XIII structure were obtained by refining the model against x-ray diffraction data from 10.0 to 2.65 Å resolution using the program X-PLOR (49Brunger A.T. Kuriyan J. Karplus M. Science. 1987; 235: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (2126) Google Scholar) to give a crystallographic R factor of 21.7%. The final model exhibits good geometry (root mean square deviation from ideality of 0.012 Å for bond lengths, 1.8° for bond angles, 25.6° for torsion angles, and 1.5° for improper torsion angles); the average value of the individually refined atomic temperature factors is 26.7 Å2. Refined coordinates for the factor XIII structure have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank (identifying code: 1ggt). Models of the keratinocyte transglutaminase mutant structures were generated by modifying the homology model using the computer program O (50Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M.

The membrane TG activities in cultured cells from the probands ranged from 2.2 (LI-20 III.1) to 175.4 pmol/h mg (LI-20 II.1), significantly different from that in normal and heterozygotic (LI-8 I.1, LI-22 III.3) individuals (Table I). Northern blots showed missing TGK mRNA in proband LI-8 II.2 and aberrant synthesis in LI-22 IV.4 and LI-22 III.3, whereas probands from the other two familes had normal sizes and levels of mRNA (Fig. 2). The banding pattern obtained with the probes DH42 and 3′ NC in probands III.3 and IV.4 of LI-22 (Fig. 1) was very similar to the one observed in the previously reported family LI-2, which had a homozygous A to G change in the splice acceptor site of intron 5 (33Huber M.

LI-8 II.2 had a homozygous C to T mutation at position +1354 in exon 3, changing R127 to a stop codon. This mutation creates a newDdeI site in exon 3 giving rise to a new band of 181 bp.DdeI digestion of amplified exon 3 from the patient and his parents showed that the patient was homozygous for the 181-bp band, whereas the parents were heterozygous for the 181- and 207-bp band (Fig. 4 g). Patient LI-11 II.1 was a compound heterozygote for two missense mutations. He carries a G to A change at position +7110, changing Gly-473 to serine (Fig. 4 a), and a C to T change at +8479, changing Arg-687 to cysteine (Fig. 4 b). In family LI-20, patients III.1 and III.2 carry a heterozygous C to G mutation at +4019 (S358R) inherited from the mother (Fig. 4 c) and a heterozygous G to T change at +8509 in the splice donor site of intron 13 inherited from the father (Fig. 4 d). Sequencing of 14 cDNA clones obtained by RT-PCR using total RNA from patients LI-20 III.1 and III.2 (Fig. 1) with primers DH5/DH7 (33Huber M. Rettler I. Bernasconi K. Frenk E. Lavrijsen S. Ponec M. Bon A. Lautenschlager S. Schorderet D. Hohl D. Science. 1995; 267: 525-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) revealed that 10 clones contained a deletion of 54 nucleotides (+8454 to +8509), whereas the remaining clones had normal sequence. This implicates that the splicing machinery uses GT at position +8454 as the new splice donor site, which is consistent with the calculation of the consensus values for putative splice acceptor sites (52Mount S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 459-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (2783) Google Scholar, 53Shapiro M.B. Senepathy P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 7155-7174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1976) Google Scholar) 100 bp up- and downstream of the mutated splice junction (data not shown). This leads to an in-frame deletion of amino acids 679–696 (Δ679–696). Since the mother was affected by lamellar ichthyosis and showed low TG activity (Table I), all 15 of her exons were sequenced. This revealed an additional heterozygous mutation replacing a G nucleotide with C at position +4080 changing Val-379 into leucine (Fig. 4 e). This mutation was not present in her two children showing that the V379L and S358R mutations are not on the same allele. Patient LI-22 IV.4 is a compound heterozygote for an A to G (+3366) change in the splice acceptor site of intron 5 (data not shown) and a C to T exchange at position +3434 (R315C) (Fig. 4 f). The A to G mutation at +3366 creates a new MspI site, allowing us to follow the inheritance of the mutation in the LI-22 pedigree. The mutant allele is present in the patient and was inherited from his mother and maternal grandmother (data not shown). The second mutation at +3434 destroys the single HaeIII site in exon 6. The restriction enzyme analysis showed that only the patient has this mutant band (data not shown). Whether this mutation was inherited from the father or represents a new mutation could not be tested since DNA from the father was not available. CpG dinucleotides have on the average a much higher rate of mutations than other dinucleotides (54Cooper D.N. Youssoufian H. Hum. Genet. 1988; 78: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). In four of the presented 7 mutations (R127Stop, R315C, G473S, and R687C), C nucleotides in CpG are mutated into a T either on the sense or on the antisense DNA strand (G473S). Therefore, these sites could constitute mutational hot spots. The extensive conservation of amino acid residues of 42% between keratinocyte transglutaminase and factor XIII A-subunit indicates that their folding is conserved. Therefore, the factor XIII A-subunit crystal structure served as a reliable scaffold to construct a homology model of keratinocyte transglutaminase (Fig. 5) to better understand the molecular basis for the decreased enzymatic activity caused by the keratinocyte transglutaminase mutations. Factor XIII A-subunit is composed of four domains, which, from theN-terminal end, have been designated as β-sandwich, central core domain, and β-barrels 1 and 2 (5Yee V.C. Pedersen L.C. Le Trong I. Bishop P.D. Stenkamp R.E. Teller D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7296-7300Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). For additional indications of the structural and functional importance of the mutation sites, a structure-guided alignment of 19 known transglutaminase sequences was additionally used (data not shown). Residue Arg-315, in the catalytic core domain, is located in a surface loop between two helices (Fig. 5). The arginine side chain is buried in the structure and forms a salt bridge with Asp-306 as well as a hydrogen bond to the main chain carbonyl group of Met-310 (Fig. 6). These bonds serve to stabilize the conformation of this surface loop. The Arg-315–Asp-306 salt bridge is conserved in a total of 13 of the TG sequences including factor XIII A-subunit and TGK; in one of the other sequences, the equivalent arginine residue interacts with a glutamic acid side chain, and in the remaining molecules, the size of this loop is altered by either amino acid insertions or deletions.

https://openalex.org/W2006483772,"Ca2+ release from intracellular stores can be activated in neurons by influx of Ca2+through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. This process, called Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release, relies on the properties of the ryanodine receptor and represents a mechanism by which Ca2+ influx during neuronal activity can be amplified into large intracellular Ca2+ signals. In a differentiated neuroblastoma cell line, we show that caffeine, a pharmacological activator of the ryanodine receptor, released Ca2+ from intracellular stores in a Ca2+-dependent and ryanodine-sensitive manner. The pyridine nucleotide, cyclic ADP-ribose, thought to be an endogenous modulator of ryanodine receptors also amplified Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release in these neurons. Cyclic ADP-ribose enhanced the total cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels during controlled Ca2+ influx through voltage gated channels, in a concentration-dependent and ryanodine-sensitive manner and also increased the sensitivity with which a small amount of Ca2+ influx could trigger additional release from the ryanodine-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ stores. Single cell imaging showed that following the Ca2+ influx, cyclic ADP-ribose enhanced the spatial spread of the Ca2+ signal from the edge of the cell into its center. These powerful actions suggest a role for cyclic ADP-ribose in the functional coupling of neuronal depolarization, Ca2+entry, and global intracellular Ca2+ signaling."

Salicylic acid (2-hydroxybenzoic acid) is believed to play an important role in plant defense responses against pathogen attack (see Refs. 1Dempsey D.A.

Many studies implicate SA 1The abbreviations used are: SA, salicylic acid; APX, ascorbate peroxidase; AsA, ascorbic acid; DMPO, 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide; PR, pathogenesis-related; SAR, systemic acquired resistance.1The abbreviations used are: SA, salicylic acid; APX, ascorbate peroxidase; AsA, ascorbic acid; DMPO, 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide; PR, pathogenesis-related; SAR, systemic acquired resistance. as an essential signal in the development of the systemic acquired resistance (SAR) in several plant species. SAR is an inducible, long lasting, broad-based pathogen defense mechanism following infection of plants, particularly by a necrotizing pathogen. An understanding of the molecular basis of SAR may well lead to the development of both genetically engineered crops with enhanced disease resistance and novel chemicals that stimulate the plants' resistance to pathogens. Although induction of SAR is associated with a significant increase in endogenous SA levels in plants (3Malamy J. Carr J.P. Klessig D.F. Raskin I. Science. 1990; 250: 1002-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar, 4Metraux J.P. Signer H. Ryals J. Ward E. Wyss-Benz M. Gaudin J. Raschdorf K. Schmid E. Blum W. Inverardi B. Science. 1990; 250: 1004-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar), the biochemical basis of this phenomenon is obscure. SA accumulation is essential for pathogenesis-related (PR) gene expression (5Ward E.R. Uknes S.J. Williams S.C. Dincher S.S. Wiederhold D.L. Aleander D.C. Al-Goy P. Metraux J.P. Ryals J.A.

Exogenous application of SA to Arabidopsis or tobacco switches on the same set of SAR genes as pathogen infection and induces protection against the same spectrum of pathogens (5Ward E.R. Uknes S.J.

Experiments with transgenic plants that express a bacterial salicylate hydroxylase gene have shown that SA could be a transmissible signal (9Gaffney T. Friedrich L. Vernooij B. Negrotto D. Nye G. Uknes S. Ward E. Kessmann H. Ryals J. Science. 1993; 261: 754-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar). The constitutive expression of salicylate hydroxylase, encoded by the nahG gene fromPseudomonas putida, prevented the accumulation of SA in transgenic tobacco by converting it to catechol, which is inactive in SAR. Treatment of nahG plants with tobacco mosaic virus did not induce SAR (9Gaffney T. Friedrich L. Vernooij B. Negrotto D. Nye G. Uknes S. Ward E. Kessmann H. Ryals J. Science. 1993; 261: 754-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar) or SAR gene expression in systemic leaves (10Vernooij B. Friedrich L. Morse A. Reist R. Kolditz-Jawhar R. Ward E. Uknes S. Kessmann H. Ryals J. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 959-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Grafting experiments involving nahG and wild-type tobacco have suggested that although SA is probably not a long distance signal, its presence in systemic tissue is absolutely required for PR protein expression and establishment of SAR (10Vernooij B. Friedrich L. Morse A. Reist R. Kolditz-Jawhar R. Ward E. Uknes S. Kessmann H. Ryals J. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 959-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). PR-1a gene expression in infected tissues is dependent on SA accumulation and supports the suggestion that at least local induction of this PR protein operates via salicylate signaling (11Bi Y.M. Kenton P. Mur L. Darby R. Draper J. Plant J. 1995; 8: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Klessig and co-workers (12Chen Z. Silva H. Klessig D.F.

Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28492-28501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) have suggested that one mechanism of SA action is to inhibit catalase and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) (15Durner J. Klessig D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11312-11316Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), thereby elevating the endogenous levels of H2O2, that result from either the oxidative burst associated with the hypersensitive response following pathogen attack or from metabolic processes (e.g. photorespiration, photosynthesis, and oxidative phosphorylation). According to this hypothesis, the elevated level of H2O2 or other reactive oxygen species acts as a second messenger to switch on defense gene expression and activate SAR. However later studies on the interaction of SA with catalase have provided evidence against the specific binding of SA to plant catalase (16Ruffer M. Steipe B. Zenk M.H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In addition, while the irreversible catalase inhibitor 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole was found to be a weak inducer of PR-1 expression relative to SA in wild-type tobacco, it was unable to induce PR-1 in nahG transformed plants. This suggests that the action of PR-1 depends on the accumulation of SA but not necessarily on the inhibition of catalase (11Bi Y.M. Kenton P. Mur L. Darby R. Draper J. Plant J. 1995; 8: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 17Neuenschwander U. Vernooij B. Friedrich L. Uknes S. Kessmann H. Ryals J. Plant J. 1995; 8: 227-233Crossref Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The present communication is concerned with the interactions of SA with APX in vitro. APX with ascorbic acid (AsA) as a reducing substrate is believed to scavenge excess H2O2formed in plants under both stress and normal conditions (18Asada K. Physiol. Plant. 1992; 85: 235-241Crossref Scopus (1215) Google Scholar, 19Gara L.D. Pinto M.C. Paciolla C. Cappetti V. Arrigoni O. Obinger C. Burner U. Ebermann R. Penel C. Greppin H. Plant Peroxidases: Biochemistry and Physiology. University of Agriculture, Vienna, Austria1996: 157-162Google Scholar). The much higher reactivity of APX for hydrogen peroxide compared with catalase and the increase in its activity as a response to several stress conditions indicate a key role for this enzyme in the detoxification of oxygen-activated species (18Asada K. Physiol. Plant. 1992; 85: 235-241Crossref Scopus (1215) Google Scholar, 19Gara L.D. Pinto M.C. Paciolla C. Cappetti V. Arrigoni O. Obinger C. Burner U. Ebermann R. Penel C. Greppin H.

Plant J. 1994; 5: 397-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). It was therefore of interest to further investigate the effect of SA on this enzyme. Here we clearly demonstrate that SA is not an effective inhibitor of ascorbate oxidation but is a slow alternative reducing substrate of APX. Possible physiological implications of these results are discussed. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma or Aldrich unless otherwise stated. Reagent grade H2O2 as a 30% stock solution was obtained from BDH, and its concentration was determined using an extinction coefficient of 39.4 m−1 cm−1 at 240 nm (21Nelson D.P. Kiesow L.A. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 49: 474-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). Freshly frozen tea leaves of Camellia sinensisvar. Sinensis clone BBK35 were supplied by Unilever (Colworth House, Bedford, UK) from plants grown in Kenya. Tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacum cv. Samsun) were grown at 22 °C (John Innes Center, Norwich, UK) and used for experimentation at 8–10 weeks. Thylakoid-bound chloroplastic APX isoenzyme was purified to homogeneity from tea leaves using a previously described method (22Kvaratskhelia M. Winkel C. Thorneley R.N.F. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 1237-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) with a typical specific activity of 1,500 μmol min−1 mg−1 (assay mixture comprised 1 mm AsA, 0.5 mmH2O2, 50 mm citrate, pH 4.5). To our knowledge this is the highest ascorbate peroxidase activity ever reported. Chloroplastic stromal and cytosolic APX with specific activities of 550 and 100 μmol min−1 mg−1(assayed as above except 50 mm phosphate, pH 7.0, was used), respectively, were purified from the same plant material as reported by Chen and Asada (23Chen G.X. Asada K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1989; 30: 987-998Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). APX containing crude extracts from tobacco plants were obtained according to the method of Durner and Klessig (15Durner J. Klessig D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11312-11316Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Extinction coefficients of AsA and SA were determined in 50 mm sodium citrate buffer at 23 °C using 10-mm quartz cuvettes from the slope of linear plots of absorbanceversus the concentration of substrate. These were 12.4 ± 0.2 mm−1 cm−1 for AsA at 265 nm and 0.3 ± 0.01 mm−1 cm−1for SA at 257 nm. The extinction coefficients of the products were determined by adding H2O2 and ascorbate peroxidase to different dilutions of the reducing substrate until no further change in the spectra occurred. All experiments were repeated three times. The extinction coefficients were calculated as described above as 0.4 ± 0.04 mm−1 cm−1 for the AsA product at 265 nm and 1.6 ± 0.2 mm−1cm−1 for the SA product at 257 nm. The Δε values allowed the initial rates of disappearance of substrate and formation of products to be determined. Ultraviolet/visible absorption spectra were recorded in 1-, 5-, and 10-mm quartz cuvettes on a Shimadzu UV-2101PC spectrophotometer with a spectral bandwidth of 1 nm at a scan speed of 120 nm min−1. Pre-steady state kinetics were monitored in a stopped-flow spectrophotometer (model SF-61, Hi-Tech Scientific, Salisbury, UK). Data were recorded through an RS232 interface with a microcomputer. Compound I was generated by adding stoichiometric H2O2 to the ferric enzyme. Compound II was obtained by adding stoichiometric H2O2 and AsA to the native ferric enzyme. A sequential multimixing mode was used to measure the rate constants of freshly formed compound I (300-ms mixing delay) and II (1-s mixing delay) reduction by SA. ESR signals were recorded using a Bruker ER-200D spectrometer fitted with a rectangular cavity and a room temperature (20–23 °C) flat cell with an attachment allowing rapid (10-s) loading of samples without demounting the cell. The effect of SA on APX activity has been reinvestigated using UV/visible spectrophotometry. The spectrum of SA exhibits two peaks at 290 and 234 nm, while AsA exhibits a single peak at 265 nm. Multiple scans of the reaction of AsA oxidation by APX in the presence of 1 mm SA showed a dramatic time-dependent decrease in absorbance at 265 nm, clearly due to the disappearance of AsA (Fig. 1). By contrast, only small changes were observed at 290 nm. When the activities of all of the APX isoenzymes were assayed at 265 nm in a 1-mm cell containing 750 μmAsA, the rates of ascorbate oxidation in the presence and absence of 1 mm SA were not significantly different (1500 ± 50 and 100 ± 5 μmol min−1 mg−1 for chloroplastic and cytosolic ascorbate peroxidases respectively). In addition, ESR measurements showed that similar intensity monodehydroascorbate radical signals were produced by APX both in presence of 10 mm SA and in its absence (Fig. 1). We therefore conclude that SA (10 mm) does not measurably inhibit APX. This conclusion contrasts with that of Durner and Klessig (15Durner J. Klessig D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11312-11316Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) who have reported that SA is an inhibitor of APX. These authors used activity assays monitoring AsA disappearance at 290 nm (Δε = 2.8 mm−1 cm−1) in the presence of SA (1 mm). This assay has been used for APX activity determination for more than a decade since the discovery of the enzyme (24Nakano Y. Asada K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1981; 22: 867-880Google Scholar). Nakano and Asada (24Nakano Y. Asada K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1981; 22: 867-880Google Scholar) used 290 nm instead of the AsA maximum (265 nm) because of difficulties due to the high absorbance of AsA at the concentrations required to saturate the enzyme. SA absorbs strongly at 290 nm (ε = 3.5 ± 0.05 mm−1 cm−1). The addition of 1 mm SA to the reaction mixture containing 0.75 mm AsA results in absorbance increase from 2.1 to greater than 5.0, while changes in absorbance at 290 nm due to ascorbate oxidation are relatively small (Fig. 1). From Fig. 1 it is clear that the decrease in ascorbate absorbance at 265 nm rather than at 290 nm should be used for precise measurements of APX activity due to the much lower absorbance of SA at 265 nm. Time-dependent scans of the reaction of SA with both tea and tobacco APX isoenzymes clearly show that salicylate is a reducing substrate of APX (Fig. 2). SA reduced both compound I and compound II of the purified tea chloroplastic APX in 50 mmcitrate buffer, pH 4.5, with the second order rate constants of 4.0 × 102 and 1.5 × 102m−1 s−1, respectively. SA was oxidized only in the presence of both H2O2 and APX. This reaction exhibits two distinct stages. During the initial stage the intensities in absorbance at 415 and 257 nm increase, while the peak at 290 nm is slightly decreased (Fig. 2). Two isosbestic points are observed at 283 and 307 nm. This suggests that SA is initially converted into a single species. However, this species is unstable and undergoes subsequent chemistry. The peak at 415 nm bleaches, while intensity in absorbance at 257 nm further increases (Fig. 2). The spectrum of the final product is distinguished from SA by its higher absorbance at 257 nm and a shoulder in the region of 340 nm. This spectrum subsequently remained unchanged for more than 1 month. In an attempt to define the nature of the transient species, ESR experiments using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) as a spin trap were carried out. ESR signals were obtained only in the presence of DMPO, SA, H2O2, and enzyme (data not shown). These signals closely correlated with the formation of an intense brown color. When DMPO was added to the final product of the oxidation, which had a low absorbance at 415 nm, no ESR signals were observed. These results suggest that the initial product of APX-dependent oxidation of the substrate, with its characteristic absorbance peak at 415 nm, may be associated with SA-derived free radicals that undergo subsequent chemistry. Ascorbate oxidase activity of tea APX was assayed after the initial and final phases of SA oxidation. No enzyme inactivation resulted from SA oxidation. Benzoic acid derivatives such as 3-hydroxybenzoic acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, 2,6-dihydroxybenzoic acid, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid, and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid were also shown to be reducing substrates and not inhibitors of ascorbate oxidation by tea APX. The key role of APX in defense of plant cells against hydrogen peroxide is well documented (see Ref.18Asada K. Physiol. Plant. 1992; 85: 235-241Crossref Scopus (1215) Google Scholar and references therein). With respect to cellular location, ascorbate peroxidases are divided into the following four different types: cytosolic, chloroplast stromal, chloroplast thylakoid-bound, and glyoxysomal (23Chen G.X. Asada K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1989; 30: 987-998Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 24Nakano Y. Asada K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1981; 22: 867-880Google Scholar, 25Mittler R. Zilinskas B.A. Plant Physiol. 1991; 97: 962-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 26Miyake C. Cao W.H. Asada K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1993; 34: 881-889Google Scholar). Most effort to date has gone into the purification and characterization of the first three types of APX. The glyoxysomal form has not been isolated, but its cDNA has been cloned (27Bunkelmann J.R. Trelease R.N. Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The presence of APX not only in chloroplasts, organelles deficient in catalase, and the cytosol, but also in catalase-rich glyoxysomes suggests that APX functions with catalase as a hydrogen peroxide scavenger. We have studied the effect of SA on cytosolic, chloroplastic thylakoid-bound, and chloroplastic stromal APX isoenzymes purified from tea plants as well as on an APX extract obtained from tobacco plants. Contrary to a recent report (15Durner J. Klessig D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11312-11316Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), we demonstrate conclusively that none of these APX isoenzymes is inhibited by concentrations of SA up to 10 mm. The suggestion that SA-dependent inhibition of APX in planta may result in the elevation of H2O2 levels, which in turn acts as a second messenger in SAR signaling (15Durner J. Klessig D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11312-11316Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), is therefore not tenable. Neuenschwander et al. (17Neuenschwander U. Vernooij B. Friedrich L. Uknes S. Kessmann H. Ryals J. Plant J. 1995; 8: 227-233Crossref Scopus (186) Google Scholar) reported that no increase of H2O2 in tobacco mosaic virus-infected tobacco plants is found during the onset of SAR (17Neuenschwander U. Vernooij B. Friedrich L. Uknes S. Kessmann H. Ryals J. Plant J. 1995; 8: 227-233Crossref Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In addition hydrogen peroxide does not function downstream of SA (11Bi Y.M. Kenton P. Mur L. Darby R. Draper J. Plant J. 1995; 8: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Taken together with our data, it is clear that APX remains a key antioxidant in plant cells during SAR. We have demonstrated for the first time that SA is a reducing substrate of APX. The oxidation reaction is slow apparently due to the presence of an electron-withdrawing carboxyl group adjacent to the hydroxyl group. The transient products of the oxidation appear to be SA free radicals that undergo subsequent chemistry. This observation has physiological implications since APX-dependent oxidation of SA could be essential for ameliorating the negative effects of this phenolic acid on plant cells. SA is a potential allelochemical, capable of inhibiting seed germination (28Schulz M. Schnabl H. Manthe B. Schweihofen B. Casser I. Phytochemistry. 1993; 33: 291-294Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar), seedling development (29Einhellig F.A. Putnam A.R. Tang C.S. The Science of Allelopathy. Wiley, New York1986: 317Google Scholar), and mineral uptake by changing the plasma membrane permeability (28Schulz M. Schnabl H. Manthe B. Schweihofen B. Casser I. Phytochemistry. 1993; 33: 291-294Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Usually plants tend to detoxify phenolic acids through glycosylation or esterification (30Balke N.E. Davis M.P. Lee C.C. Allelochemicals: Role in Agriculture and Forestry. 1987; (ACS Symposium Series 330, American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.): 214Crossref Google Scholar). However, Schulz et al. (28Schulz M. Schnabl H. Manthe B. Schweihofen B. Casser I. Phytochemistry. 1993; 33: 291-294Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar) demonstrated that SA, exogenously applied to roots of Fagopyrum esculentum, was first oxidized to 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid and then glucosylated at the 5-OH group. They also found that a protein extract prepared from roots previously treated with SA catalyzed in vitroglucosylation of SA. However, the enzymes responsible for detoxification have not yet been characterized. It is possible that APX and glucosyltransferase act cooperatively. APX-dependent oxidation of SA presumably generates free radicals located at the 1-, 3-, or 5-positions of the benzoic acid ring. Under some circumstances the 5-C⋅ radical could be hydroxylated and then glucosylated. Apparently, in different plants under certain environmental conditions other products of detoxification of SA may also be formed. Furtherin vivo studies are necessary to define the mechanism of detoxification of SA by APX. It has been reported that SA radicals derived from the catalase oxidation-reduction cycle could facilitate lipid peroxidation, which in turn activates PR-1 genes in tobacco cells (14Durner J. Klessig D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28492-28501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). It is important to note that APX is a much better oxidant of SA than is catalase. However, the induction of PR genes by phenolic acid radicals is not consistent with the observation that 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (also a substrate of APX) does not switch on PR protein expression. SA free radicals themselves may play an important role in SAR establishment. M. K. thanks Unilever Research for the supply of freshly frozen tea leaves from Kenya. We are grateful to Prof. J.

Intracellular protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) 1The abbreviations used are: PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; SH, Src homology. are a diverse group of proteins involved in signal transduction (reviewed in Ref. 1Streuli M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 182-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). They contain a conserved PTP domain, which specifically dephosphorylates tyrosine residues, and in addition, domains that regulate their subcellular localization and activity (reviewed in Ref. 2Mauro L.J. Dixon J.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 151-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). For example, the SH2 domains of the intracellular PTPs SHP-1 and SHP-2 enable these signaling molecules to localize to and interact with growth factor receptors (2Mauro L.J. Dixon J.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 151-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The PTP domains usually have broad substrate specificity, and a correct subcellular localization of these molecules is therefore important to assure specificity in their action. PTPL1 (3Saras J. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.-H. Gonez L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24082-24089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), also called PTP-BAS (4Maekawa K. Imagawa N. Nagamatsu M. Harada S.

Science. 1995; 268: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar), is a ubiquitously expressed intracellular PTP. Besides the C-terminal catalytic PTP domain, several domain structures have been identified: an N-terminal leucine zipper motif followed by a domain that has similarity to the Band 4.1 superfamily (7Arpin M. Algrain M. Louvard D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and five PDZ domains. The PDZ domain is a conserved motif of about 90 amino acid residues, which originally was identified in PSD-95 (8Cho K.-O. Hunt C.A. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1992; 9: 929-942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar), Dlg-A (9Woods D.F. Bryant P.J. Cell. 1991; 66: 451-464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar), and ZO-1 (10Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Kitani-Yasuda T. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 491-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar), each of which contains three such domains; the motif has also been called GLGF repeat or DHR. PDZ domains have subsequently been identified in many different proteins (11Ponting C.P. Phillips C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 102-103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the third PDZ domain of PSD-95 in complex with a peptide shows that the last four C-terminal amino acid residues of the peptide bind to a cleft in the domain (12Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar), consistent with the notion that PDZ domains interact with C-terminal tails of target proteins (reviewed in Ref. 13Saras J. Heldin C.-H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 455-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Fas is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family (14Itoh N. Yonehara S. Ishii A. Yonehara M. Mizushima S.-I. Sameshima M. Hase A. Seto Y. Nagata S. Cell. 1991; 66: 233-243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2676) Google Scholar), the activation of which induces apoptosis in many cell types (reviewed in Ref. 15Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4559) Google Scholar). The intracellular part of Fas contains a “death domain” necessary for the transduction of apoptotic signals (16Itoh N. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10932-10937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion of the last 15 amino acid residues in the C terminus of Fas leads to a potentiated apoptotic response (16Itoh N. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10932-10937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that this region is involved in negative regulation of signal transduction via Fas. Using a two-hybrid system in yeast, it was shown that PDZ 2 of PTPL1 could interact with the C-terminal region of Fas (Ref. 6Sato T. Irie S. Kitada S. Reed J.C. Science. 1995; 268: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar; note that in this article PDZ 2 was referred to as GLGF3). Furthermore, PTPL1 was shown to have an inhibitory effect on Fas-induced apoptosis in a T-cell line (6Sato T. Irie S. Kitada S. Reed J.C. Science. 1995; 268: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar), indicating that the interaction between Fas and PTPL1 is of physiological importance. We have characterized the interactions between the PDZ domains of PTPL1 and the C terminus of Fas. Both PDZ 2 and PDZ 4 were shown to bind to short peptides derived from the C-terminal tail of Fas. The five C-terminal amino acid residues are important for the affinity and specificity of binding, and the C-terminal valine residue has a critical role in the interaction. DNA fragments coding for PDZ domains of PTPL1 were obtained by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into the GST fusion protein expression vector pGEX1λT (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.): GST-PDZ 1, amino acid residues 1066–1166 of PTPL1; GST-PDZ 2–3, residues 1340–1579; GST-PDZ 3, residues 1469–1579; GST-PDZ 4, residues 1762–1864; GST-PDZ 4–5, residues 1762–1960; and GST-PDZ 5, residues 1856–1960. These expression vector constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli. The GST fusion proteins were produced and purified essentially as described previously (17Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3831) Google Scholar). Peptides were synthesized in an Applied Biosystems 430A peptide synthesizer using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry. All of the peptides were made with C-terminal carboxyl groups, except QSLV-amide, which was amidated in the C terminus. The peptides were coupled to Affi-Gel 15 beads (Bio-Rad; 0.2 μmol of peptide/ml of swollen beads) following the manufacturer's instructions. Peptide-coupled beads (10 μl) were incubated with GST-PDZ fusion proteins (50 nm) at 4 °C for 2 h in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1 mm dithiothreitol; total volume, 500 μl). The beads were washed four times in binding buffer, and bound fusion proteins were eluted by boiling for 5 min in SDS-sample buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 36% glycerol, 4% SDS, 10 mmdithiothreitol) and subjected to SDS-gel electrophoresis (18Blobel G. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 67: 835-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (1833) Google Scholar) using 11% polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond C Extra, Amersham Corp.), and the membranes were incubated with a rabbit antiserum raised against recombinant GST expressed in bacteria. Thereafter, the membranes were incubated with 125I-labeled protein A followed by quantification of the bands using a Fuji image analyzer. For figures, bound antibodies were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Regions of PTPL1 cDNA corresponding to the various PDZ domains were cloned into the bacterial expression vector pGEX1λT (Fig. 1). The GST fusion proteins were produced in E. coli and then subjected to SDS-gel electrophoresis. Pure preparations of fusion proteins with expected sizes were obtained (results not shown). Peptides corresponding to the C-terminal end of Fas were synthesized and coupled to Affi-Gel beads via their N termini. The beads were incubated with the different GST-PDZ fusion proteins and washed, and the bound material was eluted and analyzed by immunoblotting with an antiserum raised against GST. The fusion proteins containing PDZ 2 and PDZ 4 (GST-PDZ 2–3, GST-PDZ 4, and GST-PDZ 4–5) of PTPL1, but not GST-PDZ 1, GST-PDZ 3, and GST-PDZ 5, bound to a peptide corresponding to the last 15 amino acid residues in the C terminus of Fas (Fig. 2; Table I). Similar results were obtained by using peptides corresponding to the 5–8 last amino acid residues (Table I). These results indicate that a maximum of five C-terminal amino acid residues in Fas mediates the binding to PDZ 2 and PDZ 4 of PTPL1. The tetrapeptide QSLV bound to PDZ 2 and PDZ 4 with a somewhat lower affinity indicating that the isoleucine at the 5th position from the C terminus is involved in the interaction.Table ISummary of data obtained from binding experimentsPDZ 2–3PDZ 4PDZ 4–5DSENSNFRNEIQSLV+++++++++RNEIQSLV+++++++++NEIQSLV+++++++++EIQSLV+++++++++IQSLV+++++++++QSLV+++++++SLV+++++++++ASLV+++++++++QALV−++QSAV−+−QSLA−−−QSLV-amide−−−QSLVA−−−QSLL−−−QSLI−−−These experiments were performed as described under “Materials and Methods,” using a set of immobilized peptides derived from the C terminus of human Fas. +++, more than 25% of the added fusion protein was bound to the immobilized peptide; ++, 10–25% binding; +, 2–10% binding; −, no detected binding (less than 2%).

Open table in a new tab These experiments were performed as described under “Materials and Methods,” using a set of immobilized peptides derived from the C terminus of human Fas. +++, more than 25% of the added fusion protein was bound to the immobilized peptide; ++, 10–25% binding; +, 2–10% binding; −, no detected binding (less than 2%). Each experiment was performed at least three times. PDZ 1, PDZ 3, or PDZ 5 did not interact with any of the peptides. To determine the importance of the four most C-terminal amino acid residues in Fas for binding to the PDZ domains of PTPL1, a series of tetrapeptides in which residues at the different positions were replaced with alanine residues was analyzed. When the glutamine residue in the 4th position from the C terminus was replaced by an alanine residue the affinities for both PDZ 2 and PDZ 4 were higher compared with that of the Fas-derived peptide (QSLV). Similar results were obtained using the tripeptide SLV, suggesting that the glutamine residue may negatively influence the interaction. A peptide with the serine residue in position 3 from the C terminus replaced with an alanine residue (QALV), interacted only weakly with GST-PDZ 4 and GST-PDZ 4–5, indicating that this residue is critical for binding to PDZ 2 and important but not essential for binding to PDZ 4. Replacement of the leucine residue in position 2 (QSAV) revealed only a very weak binding to GST-PDZ 4, and no binding to PDZ 4–5 could be detected, indicating that this residue is important for interactions with both PDZ 2 and PDZ 4. A peptide with the C-terminal valine residue replaced with an alanine residue (QSLA) had no detectable affinity for any PDZ domain of PTPL1. Furthermore, no binding to PDZ domains was detected using a peptide in which the C-terminal valine residue was amidated (QSLV-amide) or a peptide with an additional alanine residue in the C-terminal end (QSLVA). PDZ domains have recently been shown to interact with peptides and proteins containing an aliphatic amino acid residue at the C terminus (reviewed in Ref. 13Saras J. Heldin C.-H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 455-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). To investigate the possibility that the C-terminal valine residue could be replaced by an isoleucine or a leucine residue, the peptides QSLI and QSLL were made. No interaction between these peptides and the PDZ domains of PTPL1 could be detected. Furthermore, PDZ 1, PDZ 3, or PDZ 5 had no detectable affinity for any of the tested peptides. Together, these results show that the C-terminal valine residue of Fas has a critical role in the interaction with PDZ 2 and PDZ 4 of PTPL1 and that the five C-terminal amino acid residues of Fas determine the affinity of the interactions. Several conserved domain structures have been identified in proteins that participate in signal transduction pathways, including SH2 domains, SH3 domains, PTB domains, and WW domains (19Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2228) Google Scholar, 20Sudol M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 161-163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The function of these domains appears to be to mediate protein-protein interactions; SH2 and PTB domains bind to regions containing phosphorylated tyrosine residues, and SH3 and WW domains bind to proline-rich regions. The PDZ domain is a novel example of a domain involved in protein-protein interactions. PDZ 1 and 2 of the membrane-associated synaptic protein PSD-95 have been shown to interact with the C-terminal tails of theN-methyl-d-aspartate receptor and Shaker-type K+ channels (21Kornau H.-C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1995; 269: 1737-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar, 22Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar), and PDZ domains of p55 and hDLG, proteins similar in structure to PSD-95, have been reported to bind to the C-terminal parts of the erythrocyte membrane protein glycophorin C and the adenomatous polyposis coli tumor suppressor gene product APC, respectively (23Hemming N.J. Anstee D.J. Staricoff M.A. Tanner M.J.A. Mohandas N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5360-5366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 24Matsumine A. Ogai A. Senda T. Okumura N. Satoh K. Baeg G.-H. Kawahara T. Kobayashi S. Okada M. Toyoshima K. Akiyama T. Science. 1966; 272: 1020-1023Crossref Scopus (409) Google Scholar). The third PDZ domain of InaD binds to the C terminus of the Ca2+ channel TRP, involved in visual signal transduction in Drosophila (25Shieh B.-H. Zhu M.Y. Neuron. 1996; 16: 991-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Here, we have shown that fusion proteins containing PDZ 2 and PDZ 4 of PTPL1 bind with high affinity to a peptide corresponding to the last 15 amino acid residues in the C-terminal end of Fas. Similar results were obtained using the C-terminal pentapeptide IQSLV. However, if this peptide was modified at any position, its affinity for PDZ domains was altered, indicating that the last 5 amino acid residues in the C terminus are involved in the interaction. These results are consistent with the previous observation that PDZ domains function as C-terminal peptide binding modules. Using peptide libraries, the binding specificities of certain PDZ domains, including PDZ 2 and PDZ 4 of PTPL1, have been investigated (Ref. 26Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar; PDZ 2 and PDZ 4 were in this report referred to as PDZ3 and PDZ5 of PTPBAS, respectively). In conformity with our data this report indicated that a serine (or threonine) residue at the 3rd position from the C terminus is preferred by PDZ 2 and that a valine residue at the C terminus is preferred by both PDZ 2 and PDZ 4. However, data obtained with the peptide library approach suggested that PDZ 2 and PDZ 4 of PTPL1 can interact with peptides containing, not only valine residues, but also isoleucine or leucine residues at the C terminus, whereas our data indicated that no such interactions occur. Moreover, the peptide library data suggested that PDZ 2 does not have any clear amino acid preferences at the 2nd position from the C terminus, whereas we have shown that an alanine residue at this position totally blocks the interaction. The reason for these discrepancies remains to be elucidated. The crystal structure of the third PDZ domain of PSD-95 in complex with a peptide showed that the last four C-terminal amino acid residues of the peptide bound to a cleft of the domain with the C-terminal valine buried in a shallow pocket (12Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the side chain of the second residue (serine) of the bound peptide did not interact with the PDZ domain. Since our results show that the interaction does not occur if the penultimate residue is an alanine residue, which is smaller than the leucine residue found at this position in Fas, it is likely that the side chain of the leucine residue is involved in the interaction between PDZ 2 and PDZ 4 of PTPL1 and Fas. PDZ 1, PDZ 3, or PDZ 5 of PTPL1 does not interact with the C terminus of Fas, and binding specificities for these domains remain to be determined. Of the five PDZ domains of PTPL1, PDZ 2 and PDZ 4 display the highest sequence similarity (3Saras J. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.-H. Gonez L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24082-24089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), consistent with our finding that these domains have in common the ability to interact with Fas; however, their amino acid identity is rather low (35%), and additional structural information is needed before the amino acid residues involved in the interaction with Fas can be identified. The available information suggests that all PDZ domains bind C-terminal sequences in proteins and that aliphatic residues are preferred at the most C-terminal position. PTPL1 is able to interact not only with Fas but also with several other proteins via its five PDZ domains and can thus potentially form multimeric protein complexes. We have recently identified and cloned a novel GTPase-activating protein for Rho that specifically interacts with PDZ 4 of PTPL1 through its C terminus. 2J. Saras, P. Franzén, P. Aspenström, U.

Further identification and characterization of proteins able to interact with PTPL1 will be an important step toward an understanding of its physiological role."
https://openalex.org/W1992904510,"As reported previously (MacDonald, R. I., Musacchio, A., Holmgren, R. A., and Saraste, M. (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 91, 1299–1303), an unfolded peptide was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis of Trp-22 to Ala in the cloned, wild type 17th repeating unit (α17) of chicken brain α-spectrin. Trp occurs in position 22 of nearly all repeating units of spectrin. In the present study, Trp-22 was mutated to Phe or to Tyr to compare thermodynamic stabilities of urea-induced unfolding of α16 and mutants thereof. α16 was chosen for this study instead of α17, because α16 has two tryptophans, allowing urea-induced unfolding to be tracked by the fluorescence of the Trp remaining in each mutant peptide and by circular dichroism in the far UV.The free energies of unfolding of W22Y and W22F were 50% that of α16, showing that Trp-22 is crucial in stabilizing the triple helical bundle motif of the spectrin repeating unit. Mutation of the moderately conserved Trp-95 of α16 to Val, which occupies position 95 in α17, also yielded a peptide with 50% of the free energy of unfolding of α16. Thus, the thermodynamic stability of a given spectrin repeating unit may depend on both moderately and highly conserved tryptophans. Different structural roles of Trp-22 and Trp-95 in α16 are suggested by the slightly higher wavelength of maximum emission of Trp-22, the greater acrylamide quenching of Trp-95 than Trp-22, and the longer lifetime of Trp-95. For comparison with α16, urea-induced unfolding of spectrin dimer isolated from human red cells was monitored by far UV-CD and by tryptophan fluorescence. Thermodynamic parameters could not be rigorously derived for the stability of spectrin dimer because unfolding of spectrin dimer involved more than two states, unlike unfolding of cloned repeating units. However, the similar midpoints of CD-monitored denaturation curves of α16 and spectrin dimer,i.e. 2.7 and 3.2 m urea, respectively, indicate that investigation of cloned repeating units of spectrin can provide physiologically relevant information on these structures. As reported previously (MacDonald, R. I., Musacchio, A., Holmgren, R. A., and Saraste, M. (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 91, 1299–1303), an unfolded peptide was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis of Trp-22 to Ala in the cloned, wild type 17th repeating unit (α17) of chicken brain α-spectrin.

The flexibility of the cytoskeletal protein spectrin is due to domains of 20 (α subunit) and 17 (β subunit), linearly connected repeating units, each of which is folded into a triple-helical bundle (1Bennett V. Gilligan D.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 27-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 2Lux S.E. Palek J. Handin R.I. Lux S.E. Stossel T.P. Disorders of the Red Cell Membrane in Blood: Principles and Practice of Hematology. J. B. Lippincott Co., Philadelphia1995: 1701-1818Google Scholar). It should be noted that the widely accepted term “repeating unit” does not imply sequence homology, since only one to two dozen amino acids are highly conserved among the 106–119 residues of these units of spectrin (3Gallagher P.G. Forget B.G. Semin. Hematol. 1993; 30: 4-21PubMed Google Scholar), as well as those of the closely related α-actinin (4Davison M.D. Baron M.D. Critchley D.R. Wootton J.C. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1989; 11: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and dystrophin (5Koenig M. Monaco A.P. Kunkel L.M. Cell. 1988; 53: 219-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar). Mutations of some of these conserved residues have pathologic consequences in organisms as diverse as Drosophila (6Dubreuil R.R. Curr. Top. Membr. 1996; 43: 147-167Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and man (3Gallagher P.G. Forget B.G. Semin. Hematol. 1993; 30: 4-21PubMed Google Scholar, 7Palek J. Sahr K.E. Blood. 1992; 80: 308-330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although mutations of nonconserved residues of at least human erythroid spectrin have also been associated with certain hemolytic anemias (3Gallagher P.G. Forget B.G. Semin. Hematol. 1993; 30: 4-21PubMed Google Scholar, 7Palek J. Sahr K.E. Blood. 1992; 80: 308-330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings warrant further investigation of the relationship between the sequences of the repeating units and their biochemical and biophysical properties. A promising approach is the study of cloned repeating units that can be selectively mutated, as well as expressed singly or in numbers optimal for the measurement and analysis of those biochemical and biophysical properties. The feasibility of cloning one or more repeating units was first demonstrated by Winograd et al.(8Winograd E. Hume D. Branton D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10788-10791Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) who obtained repeating units in a native-like conformation only when the spectrin cDNA coded for an integral number of repeats,i.e. when the cDNA was “conformationally phased.” Our interest is focussed on the tryptophan that is nearly invariant among the repeating units of spectrin (3Gallagher P.G. Forget B.G. Semin. Hematol. 1993; 30: 4-21PubMed Google Scholar), α-actinin (4Davison M.D. Baron M.D. Critchley D.R. Wootton J.C. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1989; 11: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and dystrophin (5Koenig M. Monaco A.P. Kunkel L.M. Cell. 1988; 53: 219-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar). In x-ray crystallography (9Yan Y. Winograd E. Viel A. Cronin T. Harrison S.C. Branton D. Science. 1993; 262: 2027-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) and NMR (10Pascual J. Pfuhl M. Rivas G. Pastore A. Saraste M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 383: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) structures of two different triple helical, single repeating units of spectrin, Trp-22 is located in a site between the bulk phase and the region bounded by the three α helices. This partially shielded position of Trp-22 is also indicated by its blue-shifted wavelength of maximum emission in α17, the cloned 17th repeating unit of chicken brain α-spectrin (11MacDonald R.I. Musacchio A. Holmgren R.A. Saraste M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1299-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To probe the role of the highly conserved Trp-22 in the folding of the 17th repeating unit of chicken brain α-spectrin, α17, we mutated Trp-22 to alanine and found that α17 W22A was unfolded, suggesting that Trp-22 promotes stable folding of a repeating unit (11MacDonald R.I. Musacchio A. Holmgren R.A. Saraste M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1299-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). More conservative mutations of Trp-22 to Phe or to Tyr were made in the present study to obtain folded Trp-22 mutants for quantitative measurement of the importance of Trp-22 for the thermodynamic stability of a spectrin repeating unit. The 16th repeating unit (α16) of chicken brain α-spectrin was chosen for the present study instead of α17, because α16 has two tryptophans instead of the single one in α17. Hence, the fluorescence of the tryptophan remaining after site-directed mutagenesis of either the highly conserved Trp-22 or the less highly conserved Trp-95 could be measured to monitor tertiary structure during urea-induced unfolding of the mutant peptides. Secondary structure was monitored during urea-induced unfolding by CD at 222 nm. The free energies of unfolding of mutant peptides W22F and W22Y were 50% of α16, establishing that Trp-22 significantly stabilizes the folding of α16. A major contribution to understanding how folding of the repeating unit is stabilized has been made by modeling the amino acid sequences of the helical regions of repeating units of spectrin and dystrophin (12Parry D.A.D. Dixon T.W. Cohen C. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: 858-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Modeling studies have revealed the arrangement of these residues in repeating heptad patterns designated “a” through “g,” as depicted in Fig. 1 and indicated in Table I. The repeating heptad pattern is thought to stabilize each triple helical repeating unit, because the “a” and “d” residues, which are located in the inter-helical region, are frequently nonpolar so that one of these residues may form a hydrophobic association with a nonpolar a or d residue in an adjacent helix, whereas “e” and “g” residues, which are located between the inter-helical region and the bulk phase, are frequently charged so that one of these residues may form an inter-helical salt bridge with an e or g residue of opposite charge in an adjacent helix (12Parry D.A.D. Dixon T.W. Cohen C. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: 858-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). As a large, hydrophobic residue in a g position, however, Trp-22 appears to be anomalous, in contrast with the less highly conserved Trp-95 which occurs in an a position. Together with the current finding that Trp-22 significantly increases the thermodynamic stability of α16, the anomalous position of Trp-22 in the repeating heptad pattern suggests that Trp-22 may be involved in a novel mechanism of stabilizing repeating units of spectrin.Table IAmino acid sequences of the 16th repeating unit (α16) of chicken brain α-spectrin and the peptides produced for this study1, 20, 30, 40, 50* * * * * *gabcdefgabcdefgabcdefgabcd abcdefgabcdefα16AKLNESHRLHQFFRDMDDEESWIKEKKLLVSSEDYGRDLTGVQNLRKKHKRLEAW22Y---------------------Y--------------------------------W22F---------------------F--------------------------------W22Y,S74L---------------------Y--------------------------------W22Y,V92M---------------------Y--------------------------------W95V------------------------------------------------------60 70 80 90 100 110******gabcdefgabcdefgabcdefabcdefgabcdefgabcdefgabcdα16ELAAHEPAIQGVLDTGKKLSDDNTIGKEEIQQRLAQFVDHWKELKQLAAARGQRLEW22Y--------------------------------------------------------W22F--------------------------------------------------------W22Y,S74L-------------------L------------------------------------W22Y,V92M-------------------------------------M------------------W95V----------------------------------------V---------------Hyphens indicate unchanged residues.

The chicken brain α-spectrin cDNA, some of the oligonucleotides, and some of the pET8c vector were generous gifts from Dr. Matti Saraste. The remaining oligonucleotides were synthesized by the Northwestern Biotechnology Facility or by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. Constructs were prepared by standard methods (13Sambrook J.

Saraste M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Salvén P. Erämaa M. Holm L. Lehto V.-P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 79-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) by AmpliTaq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer). Mutations W22Y, W22F, and W95V were introduced in oligonucleotides, as described previously (11MacDonald R.I. Musacchio A. Holmgren R.A. Saraste M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1299-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Amplified DNA fragments were isolated from agarose gels, ligated to pET8c vector (16Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Duberdorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5991) Google Scholar), and used to transform BL21(DE3) strain Escherichia coli made competent by treatment with RbCl (17Hanahan D. Glover D.M. Techniques of Transformation of E. coli in DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1985: 109-127Google Scholar). Transformed cells were selected by growth on ampicillin plates. The sequences of inserted cDNAs of all plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing and are shown in Table I. The sequence of α16 is as described previously (11MacDonald R.I. Musacchio A. Holmgren R.A. Saraste M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1299-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), except that alanine is added at the N terminus which then is A and not K, and is exactly the same as the corresponding sequence from chicken brain α-spectrin (15Wasenius V.-M. Saraste M. Salvén P. Erämaa M. Holm L. Lehto V.-P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 79-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The peptides were obtained by growing plasmid-containing cells in 3 liters of Luria-Bertani medium + 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C until theA600 nm was between 0.2 and 0.6. Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside was added to a concentration of 0.5 mm and growth continued for another 3 h. After pelleting in the JS-4.2 rotor of a Beckman J-6B centrifuge at 3,297 × g for 1 h and storage at −20 °C, the cells were sonicated in about 10 volumes of chilled, 0.02 mTris-HCl, pH 8, + 1 mm EDTA + 0.15 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride + 1 mm dithiothreitol for 5, 1-min sonication periods alternating with 1-min rest periods. Cell debris was removed at 4 °C by ultracentrifugation in a type 45Ti rotor for 1 h at 186,000 × g or by centrifugation in a Sorvall SS34 rotor for 1 h at 27,000 × g. The supernatant was passed through a 0.45-μm filter and a 0.2-μm filter prior to DEAE-5PW high performance liquid chromatography (Toso-Haas). Peptides were detected on 15% SDS-PAGE gels in 3m urea, further purified on Sephacryl S-100 (Sigma) and/or Q-Sepharose (Sigma) prior to desalting on 10DG columns (Bio-Rad) and stored at −20 °C in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8. Peptides were at least 99% pure (with the exception of W22F which was at least 97% pure) by densitometry of SDS-PAGE gels. Yields were 10–100 mg per 3 liters of culture. Peptide concentrations were determined from their absorbance at 280 nm, their tryptophan and tyrosine contents and the molar extinction coefficients at 280 nm for tryptophan and tyrosine (18). Exposure of the peptides to 6 m guanidine hydrochloride for comparison with native peptides (19Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5034) Google Scholar) had a negligible (<5%, except for α16 W22F at 8%) effect on their absorbance. The first 10 amino acids at the N terminus of the wild type, 16th repeating unit (α16, formerly R16 (11MacDonald R.I. Musacchio A. Holmgren R.A. Saraste M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1299-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar)), were sequenced by Dr. Joseph Leykam at the Macromolecular Structure Facility, Michigan State University, and found to be the same as in Table I. Mass spectrometry analysis of all six peptides by Dr. Richard Milberg at the University of Illinois, Urbana, gave the expected Mr ± 0.1–0.2%. According to published methods (20Budzynski D.M. Benight A.S. LaBrake C.C. Fung L.W.-M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3653-3660Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), a crude extract of spectrin was obtained by incubating red cell ghosts, which had been prepared from freshly drawn human red cells, in 0.5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol + 0.02 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate + 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 9, at 37 °C. The crude extract was concentrated by ultrafiltration and layered on a Sepharose CL-4B column to isolate spectrin dimers. The spectrin dimer concentration was calculated from its extinction coefficient at 280 nm, i.e.10.0 for a 1% solution (20Budzynski D.M. Benight A.S. LaBrake C.C. Fung L.W.-M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3653-3660Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Densitometry of spectrin analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 8% polyacrylamide gels showed it to be at least 99% pure. 8 or 10 m stock solutions of urea were made on the day of use by dissolving the urea in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, to maintain a pH of 8 in the peptide-containing samples. For Stern-Volmer measurements 1m acrylamide stock solutions were also prepared on the day of use. All samples gave an absorbance at 295 nm of less than 0.1 in a cell of 1 cm path length so that correction for an inner filter effect was unnecessary (21Subbarao N.K. MacDonald R.C. Analyst. 1993; 118: 913-916Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Steady-state fluorescence of 3 to 5 μm peptide or 50 μg/ml spectrin dimer in a cell of 0.5 cm path length was measured at room temperature with an AlphaScan fluorimeter (Photon Technology International) at a 4 or 6 nm band pass. Peptidyl tryptophan was excited at 295 nm and generally scanned from 300 to 400 nm. Raman and Rayleigh signals were subtracted from each scan. Measurements of urea-containing samples were performed at least 1 h after additions of the peptide to solutions at the appropriate urea concentrations. After scanning, the samples were usually stored at 4 °C overnight and re-scanned the next day to detect any changes in the readings that might alter the evaluation of thermodynamic parameters of unfolding. As no such changes were detected, all samples appeared to have attained equilibrium after an hour at room temperature. Fluorescence lifetimes were measured at room temperature in a LS100, nanosecond pulse fluorometer (Photon Technology International) with a hydrogen lamp in the time-correlated, single photon counting mode. Samples in a cell of 0.5 cm path length were excited at 297 nm and the emission recorded at 330 nm. To correct for the excitation pulse, light scattering of a second sample of 0.1 mg/ml glycogen was measured before each excitation of the peptide sample. Decays were fit to one or more exponentials by an iterative procedure based on the Marquardt algorithm (22Johnson M.L. Faunt L.M. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 210: 16Google Scholar). χ2 values ranged from 0.9 to 1.2. Far-UV CD spectra of peptides at 5 μm in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8, or of spectrin dimer at 50 μg/ml in 0.1 m NaCl + 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, + 0.1 mm EDTA + 0.1 mm β-mercaptoethanol in a 0.1-cm quartz cell were taken at room temperature with a Jasco 500C spectropolarimeter. Calibration was performed with a solution of d-10-camphorsulfonic acid (23Yang J.T. Wu C.C. Martinez H.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 208-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar), and base lines were subtracted from all samples. CD measurements are reported as mean residue ellipticities, [θ], in degrees·cm2/dmol. Spectra were scanned from 250 to 190 nm in 1-nm steps with a 4-s time constant at a rate of 20 nm/min. The photomultiplier voltages corresponding with the reported values were less than 500 V. We followed the linear extrapolation method (24Pace C.N. Shirley B.A. Thompson J.A. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1989: 311-330Google Scholar), as modified (25Jackson S.E. Moracci M. elMasry N. Johnson C.M. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11259-11269Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) to include nonlinear fitting of data to Equation 1 below, which has been evaluated recently with simulated fluorescence data (26Eftink M.R. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 482-501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Application of this method has given the same thermodynamic values for unfolding (UN) of model peptides regardless of the mechanism assumed for solute-induced denaturation, i.e. denaturant binding or solvent transfer (27Scholtz J.M. Barrick D. York E.U. Stewart J.M. Baldwin R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 93: 185-189Crossref Scopus (159) Google Scholar). This method has also yielded the same ΔGUNH2O values of thioredoxin unfolding when induced either by thermal or by solute denaturation (28Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4901-4907Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) and the same ΔGUNH2O values of RNase unfolding whether induced by urea or by guanidine hydrochloride (29Yao M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3771-3781Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Our data for the cloned peptides met the requirements for analysis by this method, since measurements were made at equilibrium and urea-induced unfolding of cloned repeating units was reversible (Figs. 2 and 4) and consisted of two states with neither detectable intermediates (Fig. 5) nor significant aggregation of the native state (Fig. 9). In the case of spectrin dimer, however, plotting of fluorescence intensity at a single wavelength did not yield a smooth urea denaturation curve (not shown), apparently due to nonsimultaneous unfolding of its many repeating units, as well as nonhomologous domains. However, calculation of an intensity-averaged emission wavelength, λ, for spectrin dimer, according to Ref. 30Royer C.A. Mann C.J. Matthews C.R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1844-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, plotted versus urea concentration yielded a smooth curve.Figure 4Far UV-CD spectra of spectrin repeating units at 1.2–3.6 μm in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8, either not exposed to urea (solid lines) or unfolded in 4 m urea and refolded by dilution in buffer (dashed lines). Both samples were passed over a gel filtration column to eliminate remaining urea in the case of the refolded peptide or to maintain the same peptide concentration in the case of the native peptide. The spectra of refolded W22Y; W22Y,V92M, and W95V were increased by 2,000–3,000 degrees·cm2·dmol−1 to make them distinguishable from the spectra of the native forms of those native peptides.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 5Urea denaturation curves of fraction unfolded peptide based on tryptophan fluorescence (○) or far UV-CD (•) data fit to the equation describing peptide unfolding as a two-state, reversible process at equilibrium as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 9Molecular sizes of spectrin repeating units indicated by 90° light scattering versus peptide concentration.

The product of mand U50% is the free energy of unfolding in the absence of urea, ΔGUNH2O.F={(αN+βNU)+(αD+βDU)exp[(mU−mU50%)/RT]}/Equation 1 {1+exp[(mU−mU50%)/RT]}α is the y intercept of the native (N) or denatured (D) state, β is the slope of the native (N) or denatured (D) state, U is the urea concentration, R is the gas constant, 1.987 kcal·mol−1K−1, and T is the temperature in K. To superimpose fluorescence and CD denaturation curves in Figs. 5 and 8, the fluorescence intensities and [θ]222 nm from each experiment were converted into values corresponding to fractions of unfolded peptide. Fluorescence intensities at 320 or 330 nm (F), [θ]222 nm, or fraction unfolded values based on fluorescence or CD measurements from two or more experiments for each peptide were pooled and analyzed by nonlinear regression with SigmaPlot 5.0 (Jandel Scientific). To determine the molecular masses of peptides under the conditions of fluorescence and CD measurement, peptides at 0.05 to 0.5 mg/ml in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8, were excited at 300 or 400 nm in a cell of 0.5 cm path length, whereas light scattering was recorded at 300 or 400 nm and a band pass of 6 or 4 nm, respectively, in an AlphaScan fluorimeter. Standards were bovine serum albumin (Mr 66,000) and pancreatic RNase A (Mr 13,700), the diameters of which are small enough compared with the wavelength of the exciting light that only molecular size, but not shape, affect the signal (31Bier M. Methods Enzymol. 1957; 4: 147-166Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The least squares method was used to fit light scattering versuspeptide concentration to a curve, the slope of which gave the molecular mass of the peptide by interpolation between the standards by the method of Lagrange (32Spangler C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 210: 305-314Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequences of the six peptides cloned for this study are given in Table I. The peptides are 1) the 16th repeating unit (α16) of chicken brain α-spectrin, 2) the W22Y mutation of α16, 3) the W22F mutation of α16, 4) W22Y with an artifactual second mutation, S74L, 5) W22Y with another artifactual second mutation, V92M, and 6) the W95V mutation of α16. The peptides mutated at Trp-22 were cloned to assess its role in the stable folding of α16, and W95V was cloned to compare the fluorescence properties of Trp-22 and Trp-95 and to probe the role of Trp-95 in the stable folding of α16.

In a previous report, we showed that a signaling factor, encoded by a gene located on the distal portion of chromosome 21, distinct from the IFNAR-1 receptor, was necessary for 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase activity and antiviral responses, but not for high affinity ligand binding. In the present studies using hybrid Chinese hamster ovary cell lines containing portions of human chromosome 21, we show that the type I IFN signaling molecule, designated herein as ISF21, is distinct from the second receptor component, IFNAR-2, which is expressed in signaling and non-signaling cell lines. The location of the gene encoding ISF21 is narrowed to a region between the 10;21 and the r21 breakpoints, importantly eliminating the Mx gene located at 21q22.3 (the product of which is involved in IFN-induced antiviral responses) as a candidate for the signaling factor. To characterize the action of this factor in the type I IFN signaling pathway, we show that it acts independently of receptor down-regulation following ligand binding, both of which occur equally in the presence or absence of the factor. In addition, we demonstrate that ISF21 is necessary for transcriptional activation of 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase, 6–16, and guanylate-binding protein gene promoter reporter constructs, which are mediated by several signaling pathways. ISF21 represents a novel factor as the localization to chromosome 21, and the data presented in this study exclude any of the known type I IFN signal-transducing molecules.

The type I interferons (IFNs) 1The abbreviations used are: IFN, interferon; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; GBP, guanylate-binding protein; IFNAR, type I interferon receptor; IRF-1, interferon regulatory factor 1; ISGF3, interferon-stimulated gene factor 3; ISG, interferon-stimulated gene; ISRE, interferon-stimulated response element; OAS, oligoadenylate synthetase; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase pair(s). are a family of species-specific, multifunctional cytokines, which in humans include 15 subtypes of IFNα with 75–98% amino acid identity, IFNω with 70% identity to consensus IFNα, and the least related IFNβ with 35% identity to IFNα (1Weissman C. Weber H. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1986; 33: 251-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Despite quantitative differences in biological specific activities among type I IFN subtypes (2Fish E.N. Bannerjee K. Stebbing N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 112: 537-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and differences in antigenicity (3Overall M.L. Hertzog P.J. Mol. Immunol. 1992; 29: 391-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), they all induce similar biological functions in human cells (4Pestka S. Langer J.A. Zoon K.C. Samuel C.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 727-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar) and compete for binding to cell surface receptors (5Langer J.A. Pestka S. Immunol. Today. 1988; 9: 393-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The first cloned component of the human type I IFN receptor (designated as IFNAR-1), when expressed in mouse BTG9A cells, appeared to selectively mediate responses to a restricted range of type I IFNs: only IFNαB but not IFNα2 nor IFNβ (6Uzé G. Lutfalla G. Gresser I. Cell. 1990; 60: 225-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). The inability of IFNAR-1-transfected cells to respond to all IFNs may have been due to the absences of other human receptor components and a difference in the ability of these subtypes to interact with (other) murine receptor components. Indeed, the definition of the role of IFNAR-1 in ligand binding has been complicated by the differences in results obtained when the receptor was expressed in different types of host cells. Recently, a second IFN receptor component (encoded by a gene designated as IFNAR-2) was identified and shown to exist as a soluble form (IFNAR-2a) and a transmembrane form with a short cytoplasmic domain (IFNAR-2b) (7Novick D. Cohen B. Rubinstein M. Cell. 1994; 77: 391-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). This component was shown to bind type I IFNs αB, α2, αC, and β by cross-linking experiments, and when co-expressed with IFNAR-1 in murine cells bound 125I-IFNα2 with an affinity of ∼300 pm. However, the function of IFNAR-2b in signal transduction was unclear (7Novick D. Cohen B. Rubinstein M. Cell. 1994; 77: 391-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that the IFNAR-2 gene encodes a third form with a longer cyotoplasmic domain, designated as IFNAR-2c, which mediates signaling when co-expressed with IFNAR-1 in murine L929 cells (8Domanksi P.

IFNAR-1 has been localized to human chromosome 21 in the region 21q22.1 (5Langer J.A. Pestka S. Immunol. Today. 1988; 9: 393-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 6Uzé G.

Interferon Res. 1990; 10: 515-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We recently showed using a panel of CHO-human chromosome 21 hybrid cells that there is a gene(s) encoded in the region 21q22.2–3, and therefore distinct from IFNAR-1, that is necessary for type I IFN signal transduction (11Hertzog P.J. Hwang S.Y. Holland K.A. Tymms M.J. Iannello R. Kola I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14088-14093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells containing human chromosome 21 proximal to the 8;21 breakpoint (21q+) expressed the mRNA for IFNAR-1 and bound IFNs αB, α2, and β with an affinity of approximately 200 pm, indicating that the region 21q22.1 contained factors, in addition to IFNAR-1, required for ligand binding. However, unlike cells that contained the entire chromosome 21, the 21q+ cell line did not signal as measured by induction of 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase enzyme activity and antiviral responses. In the present study, we show that the type I IFN signaling factor encoded on human chromosome 21, now designated as ISF21, is distinct from IFNAR-2 as well as IFNAR-1 receptor components, both of which are expressed in the hybrid cell lines, including those that do not signal. The Mx gene was a candidate for the signaling factor by virtue of it exhibiting properties of a signaling molecule and its ability to induce an antiviral state and its location on human chromosome 21q22.3. In the present study, the location of the gene encoding ISF21 is narrowed to a 400-kb region between the 10;21 and r21 breakpoints which is proximal to the Mx locus. Despite the lack of signaling, hybrid cells containing the IFNAR-1 and -2 genes but not containing ISF21 are shown to bind a range of IFN subtypes, which compete with each other and undergo ligand-dependent down-regulation of IFN binding sites. Thus the signaling factor ISF21 acts independently of ligand-receptor interaction, processing, and receptor down-regulation. Importantly, we also demonstrate, using a range of IFN-sensitive reporter constructs, that the signaling factor ISF21 is necessary for signaling pathways prior to activation of IFN-responsive genes. The parental CHO-K1 cell line was obtained form the American Type Culture Collection. The following CHO-human chromosome 21 containing hybrid cell lines were obtained from D. Patterson (Eleanor Roosevelt Institute, Denver, CO): 21q+, MRC 2G, 10;21 (9542C-5a), 6918–8a1, R2–10W, 21;22 (RAJ-5), 643C-13 (7;21), and 72532x6. The human chromosomal complement of the hybrids has been described elsewhere (12Gardiner K. Horisberger M. Kraus J. Tantravahi U. Korenberg J. Rao V. Reddy S. Patterson D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 13Hart A.H. Corrick C.M. Tymms M.J. Hertzog P.J. Kola I. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1423-1430PubMed Google Scholar) and is summarized in Fig. 2. The CHO-K1 cell line was stably transfected with the human IFNAR-1 cDNA contained in an expression vector controlled by the sheep metallothionein promoter (pTV2, 13), by electroporation at 960 microfarads and 270 V. Several independent clones were expanded, and expression was confirmed by RT-PCR (data not shown). All cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% dialyzed fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, except CHO-K1 and 21q+ cultures, which were also supplemented with 2.3 mg/ml proline. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The IFNs used in this study were huIFNα2a (Hoffman La Roche, Basel, Switzerland), huIFNαB (Ciba Geigy, Basel, Switzerland), huIFNβser (Berlex Laboratories, Alameda, CA), huIFNαcon1 (Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA), and Wellferon (human lymphoblastoid IFN, Wellcome Laboratories, UK). IFNα4 was transcribed using SP6 polymerase and translated using rabbit reticulocyte lysate as described previously (14Tymms M.J. McInnes B. Gene Anal. Technol. 1988; 5: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar); control experiments using rabbit reticulocyte lysate only had no effects on gene induction in the hybrid cell lines (data not shown). For receptor binding studies, the IFNs were iodinated using modified chloramine-T procedures to a specific activity of ∼100 μCi/μg and the integrity of 125I-IFN was monitored as described previously (11Hertzog P.J.

Methods Enzymol. 1986; 119C: 267-276Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Receptor binding assays were performed essentially as described previously (11Hertzog P.J. Hwang S.Y. Holland K.A. Tymms M.J. Iannello R. Kola I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14088-14093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Scatchard analysis of binding curves was performed using the LIGAND program and was found to be statistically significant (p < 0.05) only when resolved by a “one-site” fit. Competitive binding experiments were performed using 400,000 cpm of125I-IFNαB and 1-, 3-, 10-, 30-, 100-, and 300-fold excess IFNαB, α2 and β, essentially as described previously (16Hertzog P.J. Johns T.G. Callister K.A. Dinatale A. Linnane A.W. Biochem. Int. 1990; 22: 1095-1102PubMed Google Scholar). The down-regulation of ligand binding sites on the cell surface was determined using 125I-IFNαcon1 essentially as described previously (17Constantinescu S.N. Croze E. Murti A. Wang C. Basu L. Hollander D. Russell-Harde D. Betts M. Garcia-Martinez V. Mullersman J.E. Pfeffer L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10187-10491Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The number of receptors per cell was determined by a conventional ligand binding assay and Scatchard analysis before and after incubation with 20,000 IU of this IFN/ml for 18 h. A similar study was undertaken using an 125I-4B1 monoclonal anti-IFNAR-1 antibody (17Constantinescu S.N. Croze E. Murti A. Wang C. Basu L. Hollander D. Russell-Harde D. Betts M. Garcia-Martinez V. Mullersman J.E. Pfeffer L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10187-10491Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) to measure the number of IFNAR-1 chains. Primers were generated using the published IFNAR-2 cDNA sequence (7Novick D. Cohen B. Rubinstein M. Cell. 1994; 77: 391-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar), spanning the regions 219–240 bp and 1203–1222 bp, which encompass the ATG and TGA codons, respectively. Reverse transcription was carried out using 3 μg of total RNA derived from human Daudi cells using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) at 42 °C and the antisense primer. PCR was subsequently performed on the cDNA under the following conditions: 93.5 °C for 60 s, 56 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 90 s for 35 cycles. The PCR product was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel, and a band of the expected size of 1003 bp was observed. The PCR product was cloned into pGEM-T (Promega) and sequenced, using an automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Cells were grown to mid-log phase, harvested, and poly(A)+ mRNA extracted as described previously (18Gonda T.J. Sheiness D.K. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1982; 2: 617-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Approximately 9 μg of RNA in 50% formamide was electrophoresed on 1% agarose-formaldehyde gels, transferred to Hybond C membranes (Amersham) in 20 × SSC overnight. Filters were then baked at 80 °C for 2 h and prehybridized at 42 °C for 2–3 h.The filters were hybridized with a 32P-labeled IFNAR-2 cDNA probe as described previously (11Hertzog P.J. Hwang S.Y. Holland K.A. Tymms M.J. Iannello R. Kola I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14088-14093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), stripped, and reprobed overnight at 42 °C with a 32P-labeled 1.1-kb fragment of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA as a control for RNA loading. After hybridization and washing in 0.1 × SSPE, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C, signals were visualized by autoradiography onto Kodak BioMax film. To construct a plasmid containing the 2′-5′-OAS promoter-CAT reporter (25A-CAT), a human 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase gene promoter fragment corresponding to residues 525–1435 in the published sequence (19Wathelet M. Moutschen S. Defilippi P. Cravador A. Collet M. Huez G. Content J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 155: 11-17Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar) was generated by PCR using oligonucleotides 5′-GAACTCTCTGCACATTCAGC-3′ and 5′-GGAAACACGTGTCTGGCAAC-3′ and cloned into the pCRII vector (Invitrogen Corp.). A SpeI restriction site was then created 18 bp 5′ of the ATG by PCR. A XbaI-SpeI fragment encompassing −834 to +29 of the 2′-5′-OAS promoter was then cloned into the XbaI site of pCATBasic (Promega). Reporter constructs containing a human 6–16 promoter fragment (fragment no. 3 in Ref. 20Whyatt L.M. Düwer A. Smith A.G. Rathjen P.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 7971-7976Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) were constructed by first digesting the p30X plasmid (gift from P. Rathjen, Department of Biochemistry, University of Adelaide) with HindIII and then end-filling with Klenow (Promega). After digestion with BglII, the fragment was ligated into the vector pGL3-Basic (Promega) that had been digested withSmaI and BglII, to give the p30XLuc construct. The vector had also been modified to contain a neomycin resistance gene, derived form pMCINeo, that had been inserted into the uniqueSalI site of pGL3-Basic. The GBP promoter-luciferase construct (GBP-LUC) was a gift from B. R. G. Williams (Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH). For analysis of reporter activity, cells were diluted to 1 × 107 cells/ml in electroporation buffer (20 mmHepes, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.7 mm Na2HPO4, 6 mmglucose, 0.1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.0) and 0.5 ml was incubated with 5 μg of 25A-CAT, 10 μg of 30x.Luc or 10 μg of GBP-Luc, and 5 μg of pSV-β-galactosidase Control vector (Promega) before electroporation at 960 microfarads and 270 V in a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad). Cells were plated in 10-cm dishes and allowed to recover overnight before incubation with 100 IU/ml various type I IFNs (as indicated) for 16 h. Cells were then harvested, sonicated in 250 mm Tris, pH 8, and 20 μl of clarified lysate incubated as described previously for CAT enzyme activity (21Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol Cell Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar). For luciferase assays, cells were lysed directly in reporter lysis buffer (Promega) and luciferase light units measured using a Promega Luciferase kit and a Berthold luminometer. As a control for transfection efficiency, β-galactosidase enzyme activity was determined by incubation of 30 μl of clarified lysate, prior to heat inactivation, with 2 × β-galactosidase buffer (200 mm NaPO4, pH 7.3, 2 mmMgCl2, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1.33 mg/mlo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside) in a total volume of 100 μl, at 37 °C for 30 min, and the absorbance at 415 nm read using a microplate reader (Bio-Rad). The CAT activity was determined as the percent of substrate converted to product, then expressed relative to the β-galactosidase activity for the same sample. Results were shown as -fold induction by IFN relative to untreated controls. Luciferase light units were determined relative to β-galactosidase enzyme activity and expressed as -fold induction by interferon relative to untreated controls. Cells were incubated with 0 or 1000 IU/ml IFN for 48 h before being harvested and lysed. Enzyme activity was determined by the incorporation of [α-32P]ATP into alkaline phosphatase-resistant 2′-5′-oligoadenylate-resistant “cores,” as described previously (22Hertzog P.J. Emery L.F. Cheetham B.F. Mackay I.R. Linnane A.W. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1988; 48: 192-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To determine whether the lack of signaling observed previously in the 21q+ cells was due to the absence of IFNAR-2, we performed Northern blot analysis (Fig. 1). A full-length cDNA probe for IFNAR-2a (7Novick D. Cohen B. Rubinstein M. Cell. 1994; 77: 391-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) was generated by RT-PCR using human Daudi cell total RNA. It is noteworthy that the sequence of the IFNAR-2a cDNA was identical to the published sequence (7Novick D. Cohen B. Rubinstein M. Cell. 1994; 77: 391-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) except for 3 nucleotides. At nucleotide 700, a change from C to T would result in an amino acid change from Pro to Ser at amino acid residue 212; at nucleotide 859, an A to G change would result in a change from Thr to Ala at residue 265, while a change from T to C at nucleotide 501 would be silent. Using this cDNA as a probe, IFNAR-2 mRNA transcripts were detected in all of the human chromosome 21 hybrid cells, which had previously been reported to also express IFNAR-1 (11Hertzog P.J. Hwang S.Y. Holland K.A. Tymms M.J. Iannello R. Kola I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14088-14093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but not in the parental CHO cells. As an example, Fig. 1 shows a Northern blot analysis of poly(A)+ mRNA from one signaling (72532x6) and one non-signaling (21q+) cell line and the parental CHO-K1 cells. Two transcripts of approximately 4.5 and 1.5 kb were observed, consistent with published data (7Novick D. Cohen B. Rubinstein M. Cell. 1994; 77: 391-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). This result indicates that the IFNAR-2 gene is encoded on human chromosome 21, in the region 21p-q22.1, as is IFNAR-1, and both are expressed even in the hybrid cell lines which do not signal (see below, and Ref.11Hertzog P.J. Hwang S.Y. Holland K.A. Tymms M.J. Iannello R. Kola I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14088-14093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies had described the location of a gene encoding a type I IFN signaling factor to be on the distal third of chromosome 21, distal to the 8;21 breakpoint. This region of human chromosome 21 contained the Mx genes, which possess GTPase activity and contain Zn finger motifs characteristic of signaling molecules, and are necessary for some antiviral responses to type I IFNs. Therefore it was important to determine whether ISF21 could be distinguished from Mx and at the same time, to narrow down the region containing this gene to facilitate further cloning studies. We therefore examined an extended panel of CHO-human chromosome 21 hybrid cell lines which contained smaller chromosomal deletions (Fig. 2). Induction of 2′-5′-OAS enzyme activity was observed after IFN treatment in cell lines containing human chromosome 21 fragments which extended further than the r21 breakpoint, namely R2–10W, RAJ 5, 643C-13, and 72532x6. However, no induction of 2′-5′-OAS was observed in hybrid cell lines which contained only human chromosome 21 sequences proximal to the 10;21 breakpoint, namely 6918–8a1, MRC 2G, and 21q+. This was despite the observation that these non-signaling cell lines expressed the genes encoding both known type I IFN receptor components. Therefore, the gene encoding the signaling factor ISF21 is located between the 10;21 and r21 breakpoints, and is thus distinct from the IFN receptor locus which lies in the region between the 6918 and 8;21 breakpoints (9Lutfalla G. Holland S.J. Cinato E. Monneron D. Reboul J. Rogers N.C. Smith J.M. Stark G.R. Gardiner K. Mogensen K.E. Kerr I.M. Uzé G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 101-109Crossref Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the signaling factor designated ISF21 is not the Mx gene, which would be absent from the R2–10W cell line, whereas this cell line does transduce signals. Recently an arginine methyltransferase, termed IR1B4, has been shown to associate with the type I IFN receptor and was implicated in IFN signaling (23Abramovich C. Yakobson B. Chebath J. Revel M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar); interestingly, a related arginine methly transferase, hHMT 1, was localized to human chromosome 21 2S. Antonarakis, personal communication. (GenBank™ accession no.X99209). We generated a probe for the latter gene for Southern blot analysis of the panel of hybrid cell lines. This gene was detected in the 643C-13 cell line, but not in 21q+, MRC-2G, 6918–8a1, or RAJ 5 (data not shown) and therefore did not fit the pattern of expression of ISF21. Since both IFNAR-1 and IFNAR-2 receptor components are known to be expressed in signaling and non-signaling cell lines, it was important to determine whether both components contributed to the IFN ligand binding process, which had been previously shown to be normal in all hybrid cell lines. Studies of binding to the 21q+ cell line showed the125I-IFNαB can bind in a dose-dependent, saturable manner (Kd of 201 pm, 488 binding sites/cell) (Fig. 3 A). However, after CHO-K1 cells were stably transfected with human IFNAR-1 cDNA, no specific binding of 125I-IFNαB could be detected in several independent, transfected cell lines (Fig. 3 A). IFNAR-1 expression was confirmed by Northern blot (data not shown) analysis. Thus, multiple components of the type I IFN receptor encoded by genes on chromosome 21 are required for high affinity binding, presumably IFNAR-1 and IFNAR-2. Next, binding competition studies were performed using a non-signaling cell line, deficient in the signaling factor ISF21, to ascertain whether the signaling factor might have a more subtle influence on the ability of the receptor complex to bind multiple type I IFN ligands. Competitive binding experiments show that a range of type I IFNs, namely αB, α2, and β, all compete for binding to the 21q+ cells (Fig. 3 B). The different slopes reflect the different binding affinities of type I IFNs, particularly the relatively high binding affinity of IFNβ (consistent with previous studies; see Refs.16Hertzog P.J. Johns T.G. Callister K.A. Dinatale A. Linnane A.W. Biochem. Int. 1990; 22: 1095-1102PubMed Google Scholar and 24Johns T.G. Mackay I.R. Callister K.A. Hertzog P.J. Devenish R.J. Linnane A.W. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1992; 84: 1185-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, insufficient “cold” IFNs were available to achieve complete inhibition. The concentration for 50% inhibition of binding is 344 pm for IFNαB, 629 pm for IFNα2, and <102 pm for IFNβ. The important result for this study was that the absence of the signaling factor did not affect the ability of all these type I IFNs to compete for receptor interaction. An early event in signal transduction that follows ligand-receptor engagement is internalization of the complex and subsequent down-regulation of cell surface components of the type I IFN receptor. In many receptor systems, this step depends on phosphorylation, an early signal-transducing event. Furthermore, the inability to down-regulate cell surface receptors correlates with insensitivity to IFN action (17Constantinescu S.N. Croze E. Murti A. Wang C. Basu L. Hollander D. Russell-Harde D. Betts M. Garcia-Martinez V. Mullersman J.E. Pfeffer L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10187-10491Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It was therefore possible that the signaling factor, ISF21, could be required for receptor down-regulation. We therefore examined whether the hybrid cell lines, which bound IFNs but had previously been shown not to signal, could down-regulate the ligand-receptor complex. As shown in Table I both the 21q+ non-signaling and 72532x6 signaling cell lines had similar numbers of binding sites for IFNαcon1 and an anti-IFNAR-1 monoclonal antibody on the cell surface. Furthermore, both cell lines showed equivalent down-regulation of receptors 18 h after incubation with IFN, whether determined by ligand binding (∼50% each) or binding of monoclonal antibodies to the receptor (∼20% each). Thus the proposed signaling factor, ISF21, which is absent from the 21q+ cell line, must not be required for this step in the processing of the ligand-receptor complex.Table IReceptor binding and down-regulationCell LineBinding of125I-IFNαBinding of 125I-IFNAR-1 mAbNo. of binding sites/cellPercent down-regulationNo. of binding sites/cellPercent down-regulation21q+1160498602372532x612755590018The data shown are the mean of triplicate determinations in a representative one of three independent experiments.

Previous studies had indicated that the type I IFN signaling factor was required for induction of 2′-5′-OAS enzyme activity (11Hertzog P.J. Hwang S.Y. Holland K.A. Tymms M.J. Iannello R. Kola I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14088-14093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but it was not known at which stage in the IFN-dependent increase of this enzyme this factor acted. To better define the nature of this factor, we set out to determine at what stage of IFN signaling the factor acted and whether it was involved in the induction of other IFN-responsive genes. First, a 910-bp fragment from the 2′-5′-OAS promoter region, which contains all the elements necessary for the induction of transcription of this gene, was ligated upstream of a CAT reporter gene (25A-CAT). The CHO-K1, 21q+, and 72532x6 cell lines were transiently transfected with 25A-CAT and cotransfected with a β-galactosidase construct as a control for transfection efficiency. After treatment with various human type I IFNs, the parental CHO and 21q+ cell lines showed no significant induction of CAT activity, apart from a weak induction with huIFNβ due to a low level of reactivity with hamster cells (Fig. 4 A). All type I IFNs tested, namely α2, α4, αB, Wellferon, and β, induced CAT activity in the 72532x6 cell line but not in the 21q+ cell line (Fig. 4 A), again emphasizing that ISF21 is necessary for signaling in response to a broad range of type I IFNs.

The length and amino acid sequence determine whether a given peptide can fit into the peptide binding groove of class I heavy chain molecules and subsequently be presented to the immune system. The mode of action of the processing pathway is therefore of great interest. To study the processing mechanism of MHC class I-restricted intracellular antigens, we reconstituted the proteolytic processing of a model antigen in a cell-free system. Incubation of oxidized and urea-treated OVA in lymphocyte lysate resulted in partial degradation of the antigen. Degradation of the antigen depended on the presence of ATP. Addition of methylated ubiquitin abolished the reaction which was then restored by addition of an excess of native ubiquitin, indicating that the breakdown of the antigen in lymphocyte lysate is mediated by the ubiquitin proteolytic system. Upon incubation of modified OVA in lymphocyte lysate, a specific antigenic peptide was generated. The peptide was recognized by cytotoxic T lymphocytes directed against OVA-derived, H-2Kb-restricted peptide (SIINFEKL), and by a monoclonal antibody that recognizes cell-bound Kb-SIINFEKL complexes. Formation of the peptide epitope depended on the presence of ATP and ubiquitin. These results indicate that proteolytic processing of modified OVA is carried out by the ubiquitin-mediated degradation system.

Intracellular antigens are not presented directly. The intracellular antigen is first proteolyzed in the cytoplasm of the antigen presenting cell to yield short peptides. Suitable peptides are then translocated through specialized peptide transporters (termed TAP) into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum where they bind to newly synthesized MHC class I molecules. The entire complex is then stabilized and transported to the plasma membrane where it is presented to the immune system (1Heemels M. Ploegh H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 463-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Proteolysis and generation of antigenic peptides is carried out by the multicatalytic protease (26 S proteasome). Direct evidence for the involvement of the proteasome in the processing of MHC class-I restricted intracellular antigens came from experiments in which membrane-permeable inhibitors of proteasomes were added to cells and the capacity of these cells to present antigens was monitored. These inhibitors, which block proteasome activity in vitro, inhibited the cellular turnover of short-lived and long-lived proteins, assembly of class I molecules as well as presentation of OVA introduced into the cytoplasm (2Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2206) Google Scholar). The proteasome constitutes the major proteolytic activity in the cytosol and nucleus of all eukaryotes (3Tanaka K. Yoshimura T. Kumatori A. Ichihara A. Ikai A. Nishigai M. Kameyama K. Tagaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16209-16217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is composed of two multisubunit complexes: a proteolytic core particle (20 S proteasome) and a regulatory component termed proteasome activator 700 (PA700 or 19 S particle) (4Ma C.-P. Vu J.H. Proske R.J. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3539-3547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATP-dependent assembly of 20 S proteasomes with PA700 cap complexes forms 26 S proteasomes (5DeMartino G.N. Moomaw C.R. Zagnitko O.P. Proske R.J. Chu-Ping M. Afendis S.J. Swaffield J.C. Slaughter C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20878-20884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 20 S proteasome is an ATP-independent protease that in vitro only cleaves peptides (6Orlowski M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10289-10297Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). The 20 S proteasome can proteolyze several completely unfolded proteins, but, only when activated by treatment with SDS (7Eytan E. Ganoth D. Armon T. Hershko A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7751-7755Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The physiological function of this particle is therefore unknown. The 20 S proteasome can also associate with the PA28 activator complex (11 S regulator) that enhances in vitro cleavage of short peptides but not of proteins (8Chu-Ping M. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10515-10523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Dubiel W. Pratt G. Ferrell K. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22369-22377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two homologous subunits of PA28 (α and β) are inducible by interferon-γ (10Realini C. Dubiel W. Pratt G. Ferrell K. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20727-20732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Mott J.D. Pramanik B.C. Moomaw C.R. Afendis S.J. DeMartino G.N. Slaughter C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31466-31471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a role for this activator in the processing pathway. PA28 stably expressed in a mouse fibroblasts line significantly enhanced the class I-mediated presentation of two viral epitopes, pointing to a role for the 20 S·PA28 complex in vivo (12Groettrup M. Soza A. Eggers M. Kuehn L. Dick T.P. Schild H. Rammensee H. Koszinowski U.H. Kloetzel P. Nature. 1996; 381: 166-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The reason for the augmenting effect seems to be favorable modulation of proteasomal cleavage activity (13Dick P.D. Ruppert T. Groettrup M. Kloetzel P.M. Kuehn L. Koszinowski U.H. Schild H. Rammensee H. Cell. 1996; 86: 253-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Interferon-γ also induces the expression of the 20 S proteasome subunits LMP2 and LMP7, which replace constitutive β-type subunits (14Akiyama K. Kagawa S. Tamura T. Shimbara N. Takashina M. Kristensen P. Hendil K.B. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 343: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Through use of precursor peptides as substrates it has been demonstrated that incorporation of LMP2 and LMP7 may alter the cleavage specificity of the 20 S proteasome in a manner that favors the generation of peptide epitopes (15Groettrup M. Ruppert T. Kuehn L. Seeger M. Standera S. Koszinowski U. Kloetzel P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23808-23815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In vivo it has been shown that presentation of most antigens is unaffected by LMP2 and LMP7. However, expression of LMP2 and LMP7 can restore defects in surface presentation of certain viral antigens through specific MHC class I molecules in LMP-deficient cell lines (16Cerundolo V. Kelly A. Elliot T. Trowsdale J. Townsend A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 554-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that proteolytic processing is selectively influenced by the subunit composition of the 20 S proteasome and by the association of specific regulators such as PA28. The underlying mechanism for the selective effect of LMP2 and LMP7 on the processing of protein-antigens is obscure. The 26 S proteasome is an ATP-dependent protease that degrades mostly ubiquitin-conjugated proteins (17Ugai S. Tomohiro T. Tanahashi N. Takai S. Komi N. Chung C. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1993; 113: 754-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The ubiquitin proteolytic system is a major pathway for degradation of proteins in the cytoplasm and nucleus of all eukaryotes. In this system, proteins are targeted for degradation by their prior ligation to ubiquitin, a 76-amino acid polypeptide which was highly conserved during evolution (18Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 761-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar). Covalent attachment of ubiquitin to proteins requires ATP and is carried out by the ubiquitin ligase system (19Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 182-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Ligation of ubiquitin is initiated by formation of an isopeptide bond between the carboxyl terminus of a single ubiquitin molecule and an ε-amino group of a lysine residue of the target protein (20Hershko A. Heller H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 128: 1079-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). A polyubiquitin chain is then elongated by the successive formation of isopeptide bonds between the ε-amino group of lysine 48 of the previously incorporated ubiquitin molecule and the carboxyl terminus of the incoming ubiquitin molecule (21Chau V. Tobias J.W. Bachmair A. Marriott D. Ecker D.J. Gonda D. Varshavsky A. Science. 1989; 243: 1576-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). The serial addition of ubiquitin molecules results in the synthesis of a long polyubiquitin chain (high molecular weight ubiquitin-protein conjugate). Polyubiquitinated proteins are targeted to proteolysis by the 26 S proteasome. The protein moiety of the conjugate is degraded to short peptides and free ubiquitin is released for reutilization (22Hershko A. Leshinsky E. Ganoth D. Heller H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1619-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). It has been shown that increased susceptibility to ubiquitination can facilitate the class I-restricted presentation of influenza virus nucleoprotein (23Townsend A. Bastin J. Gould B. Brownlee G. Andrew M. Coupar B. Boyle D. Chan S. Smith G. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 168: 1211-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), HIV-1 nef (24Tobery T.W. Siliciano R.F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 909-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), and β-galactosidase (25Grant P.A. Michalek M.T. Goldberg A.L. Rock K.L. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3750-3758PubMed Google Scholar). However, the general role of ubiquitination in the targeting of intracellular antigens is still unknown. Furthermore, in-depth study of the proteolytic processing of foreign antigens to yield antigenic MHC class I-restricted epitopes has been impeded due to the absence of a suitable system in which the process can be reconstituted in vitro. Here we report the development of such an in vitro system based on the processing of a model protein-antigen, oxidized and urea-treated OVA (urOVA) in lymphocyte lysate. Using it we show that the model antigen is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome dependent pathway, rather then by the 20 S proteasome. This system will facilitate biochemical characterization of all cytoplasmic reactions leading to the generation of the antigenic epitopes. Albumin from chicken egg (type VII) and ubiquitin from bovine erythrocytes were from Sigma. Synthetic H-2Kb-restricted OVA-peptide (SIINFEKL) was prepared by AnaSpec (San Jose, CA). Reductively methylated ubiquitin was prepared according to a previously published procedure (20Hershko A. Heller H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 128: 1079-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In the preparations used, >99% of the amino groups were blocked, as determined by reaction with fluorescamine (26Bohlen P. Stein S. Dairman W. Undefriend S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1973; 155: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). The T lymphoma cell lines RMA and its mutant counterpart, RMA/S (27Rock K.L. Gramm C. Benacerraf B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4200-4204Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), were kindly provided by Professor Lea Eisenbach (The Weizmann Institute, Rehovot, Israel). Recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the H-2Kb-restricted OVA epitope was a kind gift from Dr. J. W. Yewdell (NIH, Bethesda, MD). MAb Y-3 was from American Type Culture Collection; mAb 25-D1.16 was generated by Dr. Angel Porgador (28Porgador A. Yewdell J.W. Deng Y. Bennink J.R. Germain R. Immunity. 1997; 7: 715-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Nine- to 10-week-old female C57Bl mice were purchased from Harlan Sprague-Dawley and kept under laminar flow in the animal facility of The Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University. The urOVA was prepared by a two-step procedure. The reaction mixture contained the following components in a final volume of 100 μl: OVA (2 mg), 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 1 mmsodium iodine. The reaction at room temperature was initiated by addition of 50 μg of chloramine-T and was terminated after 2 min by addition of 100 μg of sodium metabisulfite. The mixture was then loaded onto a PD10 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated in buffer A: Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), sodium chloride, 50 mm. The column was then washed by successive addition of 0.5-ml portions of buffer A. Fractions containing oxidized OVA (eluting between 2.5 and 3.5 ml) were pooled. Aliquots were then subjected to treatment with urea. Urea (96 mg) was dissolved in a 150-μl aliquot containing approximately 600 μg of oxidized OVA. Incubation was for 2 h at room temperature. The mixture was then subjected to filtration on a PD10 column (equilibrated in buffer A) as described above. The protein containing fractions were pooled and concentrated in Centricon 30 (Amicon). The concentrated protein was further dialyzed for 2 h against cold buffer A. The final protein preparation termed urOVA was stored in aliquotes at −70 °C. OVA (1 mg) was radioiodinated as described above for the oxidation (“cold iodination”) of OVA, except that 1 mCi of Na125I (Amersham) was included in the reaction mixture. The radioiodinated protein was then treated with urea as described above. RMA cells were grown in spinner flask bottles (Bellco Glass Inc.) in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum to 1.5 × 106 cell/ml. The cells were then pelletted and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Cell pellets were either processed immediately or stored at −70 °C. RMA cell pellets were resuspended in 5 ml/109 cells of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA. Lysis was under nitrogen pressure in a cell disruption chamber (Parr Instruments). The crude cell extract was subjected to fractional centrifugation at 1,000 × g and then at 10,000 ×g. The 10,000 × g supernatant was subjected to ultracentrifugation for 1 h at 100,000 × g. The resulting supernatant (lysate) was stored in aliquotes at −70 °C. CTL specific for the H-2Kb-restricted OVA epitope derived from amino acid 257–264 of OVA were obtained from splenocytes of C57Bl mice immunized with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the octapeptide epitope as a minigene as described previously (29Restifo N.P. Bacik I. Irvine K.R. Yewdell J.W. McCabe B.J. Anderson R.W. Eisenlohr L.C. Rosenberg S.A. Bennink J.R. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 4414-4422PubMed Google Scholar). Degradation reaction mixtures contained the following components in a final volume of 25 μl: 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 1.25 units of creatine phosphokinase, RMA lysate (70 μg of total protein), 0.5 μg of 125I-urOVA, and additional compounds as indicated in the figure legends. Incubation was for the indicated periods of time at 37 °C. In reactions without ATP, 2-deoxyglucose (20 mm) and hexokinase (1.5 μg) (Boehringer Mannheim) were added instead of ATP and the ATP regenerating system. Reactions were stopped by addition of trichloroacetic acid. Degradation was determined by measuring the amount of soluble radioactivity after addition of trichloroacetic acid. ATP-dependent degradation was calculated in reactions performed in the presence of ATP after subtraction of trichloroacetic acid soluble radioactivity released in a parallel incubation carried out in the absence of ATP. ATP-independent degradation was determined in reactions performed in the absence of ATP after subtraction of acid-soluble radioactivity present in parallel reaction mixtures to which trichloroacetic acid was added at time 0. Conjugation assays were carried out in a reaction mixture containing the following components in a final volume of 25 μl: 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 μg of125I-urOVA (approximately 100,000 cpm), RMA lysate (70 μg), 1 mm ATPγS, 60 μm ubiquitin aldehyde (30Hershko A. Rose I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1829-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), and additional compounds as indicated. Reactions without ATP contained deoxyglucose (20 mm) and hexokinase (1.5 μg) instead of ATPγS. Incubation was for 1 h at 37 °C. Reactions were then separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a 10% polyacrylamide gels. Gels were dried and exposed to XAR-5 film (Kodak). Reactions were carried out as described above in a final volume of 2 ml containing the following components: 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 100 units of creatine phosphokinase, RMA lysate (5.6 mg of total protein), 150 μg of urOVA, and additional compounds as indicated in the figure legends. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for various time periods as indicated in the text and then immediately subjected to acid extraction. The reaction mixture was adjusted to pH 2 by addition of trifluoroacetic acid to a final concentration of 0.6% (v/v), then sonicated at full power for 30 s in a bath sonicator and rotated for an additional 30 min at 4 °C. The mixture was then microcentrifuged and the clear supernatant was subjected to size exclusion chromatography to remove proteins. The acid extract was loaded onto a 1.6 × 50-cm G-25 Sephadex (medium) column equilibrated in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, connected to a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Pharmacia). The column was washed with 80 ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The entire column-included material was pooled and lyophilized. The dried material was then dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and subjected to ultrafiltration in Centricon 3 (Amicon). The filtrate was collected, dried, and subjected to reverse-phase HPLC. Low molecular weight material from step 3 was separated on a 2.1 × 150-mm C18 column (Vydac) (eluent A, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 4% acetonitrile; eluent B, 0.085 trifluoroacetic acid, 90% acetonitrile; gradient, 4–60% B in 56 min; flow rate, 0.2 ml/min). All the material eluting between 20 and 36 min (24–45% B) was harvested by the continuous manual collection of individual peaks absorbing at 214 nm. The organic solvent was then removed from each fraction by three freeze-dry wash cycles. OVA-peptide eluted consistently between 32 and 35 min (36–39% solvent B). Each fraction from step 4 was dissolved in 160 μl of serum-free ISCOV medium, divided evenly into three separate wells of a 96-well plate each containing 5 × 103 [35S]methionine-labeled RMA/S cells (in 50 μl of ISCOV). Peptides were allowed to bind to the cells for 3 h at 37 °C. OVA-specific CTL (in 100 μl of RPMI 1640 medium containing 20% fetal calf serum) were then added at an effector:target ratio of 50:1 for further incubation for 5 h at 37 °C. Following the second incubation period, cells were pelleted. CTL-mediated killing of RMA/S cells was then determined by measuring the amount of [35S]methionine released to the culture medium in each well. The result for each peptide is the mean value of the triplicate incubation.

Stained cells were analyzed using a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Mansfield, MA). To investigate the mechanism of the cytoplasmic reactions involved in the proteolytic processing of MHC class I-restricted intracellular antigens it was necessary to reconstitute the degradation of a foreign antigen in a cellular lysate. urOVA served as a model antigen since modification by oxidation followed by treatment with urea substantially increases the susceptibility of the antigen to degradation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. 2A. Ciechanover, unpublished data. We then tested whether proteolysis of the antigen results in the formation of an OVA-specific antigenic epitope by comparing the conditions required for degradation with those required for generation of the antigenic peptide. When urOVA was incubated in lymphocyte lysate (prepared from the lymphoma cell line RMA) it was degraded in a time-dependent fashion, in the presence but not in the absence of ATP (Fig. 1). The requirement for ATP for urOVA degradation suggested that proteolysis is carried out by the ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway. To determine that polyubiquitination is indeed required for urOVA degradation, the effect of the ubiquitin derivative, MeUb, on the degradation and ligation of urOVA to ubiquitin was tested. This derivative was used in the past to demonstrate ubiquitin requirement for degradation of mitotic cyclins in clam extracts (31Hershko A. Ganoth D. Pehrson J. Palazzo R.E. Cohen L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16376-16379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In MeUb, all lysine ε-amino side groups are chemically blocked by reductive methylation (20Hershko A. Heller H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 128: 1079-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Conjugation of MeUb to the proteolytic substrate is carried out by the ubiquitin ligase system. However, whenever MeUb is incorporated into a growing ubiquitin chain, it terminates the chain extension, because its lysine 48 residue is blocked. Thus, in the presence of MeUb, low (short) rather than high, molecular weight conjugates are formed. Low molecular weight ubiquitin-protein conjugates (in contrast to HMW ubiquitin-protein adducts) are poorly degraded by the 26 S proteasome (22Hershko A. Leshinsky E. Ganoth D. Heller H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1619-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Thus, MeUb acts as an effective inhibitor of the ubiquitin system because it competes with native ubiquitin for the conjugating enzymes but produces futile ubiquitin-protein conjugates. As seen in Fig. 1, addition of MeUb to the reaction mixture almost completely inhibited degradation of urOVA in RMA lysate. This inhibition could be overcome by addition of excess native ubiquitin. We next tested the effect of MeUb on the ligation of ubiquitin to urOVA (Fig. 2). In the absence of ATP or ubiquitin, HMW ubiquitin-OVA conjugates were not visible (lanes 1 and 2). Addition of ubiquitin stimulated the formation of HMW conjugates (lane 3). Addition of MeUb resulted only in the formation of low molecular weight ub-OVA conjugates (lane 4). Native ubiquitin relieved inhibition by MeUb and restored generation of HMW ub-OVA conjugates (lane 5). These results and the inhibitory effect of MeUb on urOVA degradation (Fig. 1) indicate that formation of polyubiquitin chains is required for the degradation of urOVA in RMA lysate. The absence of detectable ubiquitin-OVA conjugates in the presence of ATP, and the fact that addition of ubiquitin greatly stimulated the formation of HMW ubiquitin-OVA conjugates indicate that the concentration of free ubiquitin in RMA lysate is very low. Nonetheless, the comparable rates of degradation of urOVA with and without added ubiquitin (Fig. 1) suggest that upon addition of excess ubiquitin, proteolysis becomes rate-limiting. Proteolytic processing of OVA in vivo produces a specific H-2Kb-restricted epitope (32Carbone F.R. Bevan M.J. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), henceforth the OVA-peptide. We therefore tested if degradation of urOVA in lymphocyte lysate also produces the expected antigenic epitope. RMA lysate was incubated either in the presence or absence of urOVA. Peptides were then extracted and purified by reverse phase chromatography on HPLC (Fig. 3). Individual HPLC-purified peptide fractions were preincubated with target RMA/S cells and then tested for recognition by OVA-specific H-2Kb-restricted CTL in a cytotoxicity assay. Lysis of target RMA/S cells was elicited by a single peptide fraction isolated from a reaction carried out in the presence of urOVA (Fig. 4 B). OVA-peptide eluted consistently at the position marked by the arrow in Fig. 3(between 36 and 39% of solvent B). No significant reactivity was observed by peptides isolated from the incubation without urOVA (Fig. 4 A).Figure 4Recognition of peptides isolated from RMA lysate by OVA-specific CTL. RMA lysate was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in the presence of ATP and ubiquitin either in the absence (A) or presence (B) of urOVA.

We therefore tested if appearance of the antigenic peptide resulting from the processing of urOVA required ATP. As depicted in Fig. 5, OVA-peptide was generated in the presence but not in the absence of ATP. This result indicates that the primary protease that processes urOVA is the 26 S proteasome. However, the possibility that the OVA-peptide is generated initially as a longer precursor by the 26 S proteasome complex and is subsequently edited by the 20S proteasome, cannot be excluded. To confirm that the active peptide fraction contains H-2Kb-restricted OVA-peptide, we tested if it is recognized by the monoclonal antibody 25-D1.16 that exclusively recognizes cell-bound Kb-SIINFEKL complexes (28Porgador A. Yewdell J.W. Deng Y. Bennink J.R. Germain R. Immunity. 1997; 7: 715-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6). Three peptide fractions (11Mott J.D.

Koszinowski U.H. Schild H. Rammensee H. Cell. 1996; 86: 253-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) were tested for recognition by 25-D1.16 and Y-3, a monoclonal antibody that recognizes Kb-peptide complexes (33Falk K. Stevanovic S. Jung G. Rammensee H. Nature. 1991; 351: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (2132) Google Scholar). The mAb 25-D1.16 recognized only fraction 12, whereas Y-3 recognized all three peptide fractions. These results indicate that fraction 12 contained the peptide SIINFEKL. CTL activity (Fig. 6 f) coincided with 25-D1.16 activity. The only difference between the two peptide-detection methods was that OVA-specific CTL recognized fraction 11 as well. This is likely due to the greater sensitivity of CTL that are able to detect the minute amounts of OVA-peptide eluting in this fraction. Quantitation of Kb-SIINFEKL complexes by mAb 25-D1.16 revealed that only 2 fmol of OVA-peptide were recovered following incubation of 3 nmol of urOVA for 30 min in RMA lysate. During this incubation period, approximately 2% (60 pmol) of urOVA was degraded (Fig. 1). The yield of OVA-peptide is therefore only 3 × 10−5 of the maximal theoretical yield expected if every urOVA molecule degraded would result in the formation of one molecule of OVA-peptide. The possible reasons for the low abundance of the antigenic peptide are discussed below. We demonstrated that degradation of urOVA in RMA lysate requires polyubiquitination. If peptides are generated directly by proteolysis, then the generation of OVA-peptide is also expected to require formation of high molecular weight urOVA-ubiquitin conjugates. As illustrated in Fig. 7 B, production of OVA-peptide in the presence of ATP was almost completely abrogated in the presence of MeUb. Inhibition in the presence of MeUb was overcome by addition of excess native ubiquitin. The magnitude of inhibition by MeUb and recovery of activity by native ubiquitin were in correlation with the degree of urOVA degradation in each reaction (Fig. 7 A). These results confirm that proteolytic processing of urOVA in RMA lysate is largely if not exclusively dependent upon polyubiquitination and is carried out by the 26 S and not the 20 S proteasome. We have developed an experimental system to study the mechanistic and regulatory aspects of the processing of MHC class I-restricted intracellular antigens. The foregoing results demonstrate that it is possible to correlate intermediate steps in the processing pathway with the formation of the end product, namely the specific MHC class I-restricted peptide epitope. Although urOVA, the protein we used as a model antigen is in fact an artificial one, it was proteolyzed by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway previously shown to be a physiological route by which MHC class I-restricted antigens are processed (34Michalek M.T. Grant E.P. Gramm C. Goldberg A.L. Rock K.L. Nature. 1993; 363: 552-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). It is worth mentioning in this context that the basic molecular mechanism of the ubiquitin proteolytic system has also been resolved through use of non-physiological protein substrates such as the hen egg lysozyme, bovine serum albumin, and oxidized ribonuclease A (35Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15237-15240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The question of whether ubiquitination is obligatory for the generation of immunogenic peptides was addressed in this study by directly comparing the requirements for degradation and production of a specific immunogenic peptide. We found that, in the presence of ATP but in the absence of ubiquitination urOVA is not degraded (Figs. 1 and 2) and OVA-peptide is not produced (Figs. 5 and 7), indicating that ubiquitination of the antigen is essential for the generation of the antigenic peptide. The results presented in this work strongly imply that targeting of antigens to degradation by the 26 S proteasome is both necessary and sufficient for production of antigenic peptides. Since most intracellular proteins are marked for degradation by prior conjugation to ubiquitin, it is conceivable that the ubiquitin-mediated proteolytic pathway is the major physiological route for the processing of MHC class I-restricted antigens. However, it is possible that, similar to ornithine decarboxylase that is degraded by the 26 S proteasome in a ubiquitin-independent manner (36Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Kameji T. Hayashi S-i. Tamura T. tanaka K. Ichihara A. Nature. 1992; 360: 597-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar), specific antigens may also be processed by this protease without being ubiquitinated. The possibility of a ubiquitin-independent but proteasome-dependent pathway for class I presentation is demonstrated by Michalek and colleagues (37Michalek M.T. Grant E.P. Rock K.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 617-624PubMed Google Scholar). The investigators show that native OVA microinjected into the cytosol of antigen presenting cells requires ubiquitin ligation for MHC class I presentation, whereas presentation of microinjected, reductively methylated OVA was ubiquitin-independent but sensitive to proteasome inhibitors. The absolute requirement of ATP and ubiquitin for the proteolytic processing of urOVA suggests that the 26 S proteasome degrades the antigen and that the 20 S particle has no independent role. In agreement with the observation that the in vitro activated 20 S proteasome can proteolyze completely unfolded proteins, Dick and co-workers (38Dick L.R. Aldrich C. Jameson S.C. Moomaw C.R. Paramanik B.C. Doyle C.K. DeMartino G.N. Bevan M.J. Forman J.M. Slaughter C.A. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 3884-3894PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that the SDS-activated 20 S proteasome can produce specific class I epitopes from completely denatured OVA and β-galactosidase. Unassembled 20 S proteasomes do exist in the cytoplasm and it is possible that they can be activated by association with specific regulators such as PA28 (39Yang Y. Fruh K. Ahn K. Peterson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27687-27694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Yet 20 S proteasomes cannot degrade native antigens. Therefore, it has been proposed that the function of the 20 S proteasome may be to edit precursor peptides that are initially produced by partial proteolysis of intact antigens by the 26 S proteasome (13Dick P.D. Ruppert T. Groettrup M. Kloetzel P.M. Kuehn L. Koszinowski U.H. Schild H. Rammensee H. Cell. 1996; 86: 253-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The ability of PA28 to associate with 20 S proteasomes and to stimulate their peptide cleavage (but not proteolytic) activity in vitro and the fact that PA28 stimulates the presentation of viral epitopes in vivo, strongly support this hypothesis. The remarkably low recovery of OVA-peptide from degradation of urOVA (Fig. 6) may be attributed to several factors apart from the slim possibility that most of the peptide was lost during isolation. One probable reason may be low frequency of cleavage within urOVA at sites just flanking the epitope (OVA 257–264). Low recovery of OVA-peptide may also be caused by instability of the antigenic peptide in the absence of microsomes. It has been demonstrated in vivo that peptide epitopes derived from cytoplasmic proteins are either undetectable or present at very low amounts in the absence of class I molecules that specifically bind these peptides (40Falk K. Rotzschke O. Rammensee H. Nature. 1990; 348: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). This suggests that peptides finding no class I receptors are fully degraded by cytoplasmic peptidases in a very short time. The question of how peptides that are released from proteasomes reach the TAP peptide transporter in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane remains open. Based on the findings that cytosolic hsp70 and hsp90 bind cytosolic peptides and elicit tumor and viral-specific immunity (41Suto R. Srivastava P.K. Science. 1995; 269: 1585-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar), Srivastava (42Srivastava P.K. Udono H. Blachere N.E. Li Z. Immunogenetics. 1994; 39: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar) expressed the hypothesis that hsp species may generally serve to carry antigenic peptides from the proteasome to the peptide transporters. This hypothesis remains to be challenged. In contrast, Frisan et al. (43Frisan T. Zhang Q. Levitskaya J. Coram M. Kurilla M.G. Masucci M.G. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 68: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) have recently suggested that binding of antigenic peptides to hsp70 may be detrimental for class I presentation. These investigators have demonstrated that presentation of an immunodominant HLA-A11 epitope derived from EBNA4 is impaired in two Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines. The defect cannot be corrected by expression of the preformed epitope in the cytoplasm or by treatment with interferon-γ, which up-regulates the expression of TAP. Maturation of class I molecules is unaffected in these cells, implying that the defect most likely occurs after proteolysis and before transport of the peptides to the endoplasmic reticulum. Understanding the interaction of putative peptide chaperones with the 26 S proteasome and TAP is an unresolved problem. The underlying molecular mechanism that may cause the defect in presentation of EBNA4 may be correlated to an impaired function of a putative peptide chaperone that either cannot bind peptides or cannot discharge them. This and other questions about the mechanism and regulation of the pathway for the proteolytic processing of MHC class I-restricted antigens, are now experimentally approachable.

At the periphery, its major physiological role is played in regulating water and solute excretion by the kidney. This hormone is also involved in blood pressure control, platelet aggregation, corticotropin and aldosterone secretion (by the adenohypophysis and the adrenals, respectively), hepatic glycogenolysis, and uterine motility (for review, see Refs. 1Jard S. Elands J. Schmidt A. Barberis C. Imura H. Shizume K. Progress in Endocrinology. Excerpta Medica, Amsterdam1988: 1183-1188Google Scholarand 2Guillon G. Ann. d'Endocrinologie ( Paris ). 1989; 50: 425-433PubMed Google Scholar). In the central nervous system, AVP is also involved in interneuronal communication (3Dreifuss J.J. Tribollet E. Goumaz M. Dubois-Dauphin M. Raggenbass M. Jard S. Jamison R. Vasopressin. John Libbey Eurotext, Paris1991: 159-166Google Scholar). These distinct biological functions are mediated, in mammals, by at least three distinct receptor subtypes: V2, V1a, and V1b. V2 receptors, involved in the antidiuretic response, are positively coupled to adenylyl cyclase (4Butlen D. Guillon G. Rajerison R.M. Jard S. Sawyer W. Manning M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1978; 14: 1006-1017PubMed Google Scholar). V1a and V1b receptors, involved in multiple peripheral responses and in corticotropin release, stimulate phospholipase C and activate protein kinase C (5Guillon G. Trueba M. Joubert D. Grazzini E.

Small amounts of vasopressin receptors in natural tissues and difficulties in solubilizing and purifying vasopressin receptors (10Roy C. Rajerison R. Bockaert J. Jard S. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 7885-7893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) led to restricted information on the topology of the hormonal binding domain of AVP receptors. However, molecular biology and biochemical approaches have recently headed the way to characterize the vasopressin receptor binding domain. Using a tritium-labeled photoreactive vasopressin agonist, Kojro et al. (11Kojro E. Eich P. Gimpl G. Fahrenholz F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13537-13544Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) demonstrated that residues Arg106 and Thr102 present in the second loop of the bovine kidney V2 receptor are involved in AVP binding. Chini et al. (12Chini B. Mouillac B. Ala Y. Balestre M.N. Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Hoflack J. Elands J. Hibert M. Manning M. Jard S. Barberis C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2176-2182Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) showed that replacement of Tyr115 by an alanine, in the first loop of the human V1a vasopressin receptor, greatly affects its ligand selectivity toward a series of vasopressin analogues. More recently, three-dimensional computer modeling of rat V1avasopressin receptor structure, combined with directed site-mutagenesis experiments, has indicated that the transmembrane domains of the receptor are also involved in the vasopressin binding site (13Mouillac B. Bice C. Balestre M.N. Elands J. Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Hoflack J. Hibert M. Jard S. Barberis C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25771-25777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). However, the precise location of vasopressin binding to the three receptor isoforms remains incompletely characterized. Another approach to the study of hormone-receptor interactions involves the use of small synthetic peptides mimicking the sequence of the supposed active region of the receptor. This approach allows the use of pure and well characterized fragments, available in large amounts, to determine their possible interaction with the specific ligand or with the receptor itself. This approach has been successfully used in the case of the thyrotropin-stimulating hormone receptor and luteotropin human choriogonadotropin receptor, where synthetic peptides mimicking the N-terminal extracellular sequence of the receptor were able to bind the hormone (14Morris J.C. Berger E.R. McCormick D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10900-10905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Roche P.C. Ryan R.J. McCormick D.J. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Similarly, peptide fragments corresponding to the N-terminal segment of the follitropin receptor were shown able to bind this hormone (16Dattatreyamurty B. Reichert Jr., L.E. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 93: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). More recently, Howl and collaborators (17Howl J. Wheatley M. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) also described the inhibitory properties of some synthetic peptides mimicking neurohypophysial hormone receptor. A 20-amino acid synthetic peptide derived from the tumor necrosis factor receptor inhibited the binding and the cytolytic activity of the corresponding recombinant human hormone (18Hwang C.D. Gatanaga M. Innins E.K. Yamamoto R.S. Granger G.A. Gatanaga T. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Biol. 1991; 245: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This approach has also been successfully used in characterizing hormonal receptor-G-protein interactions, such as synthetic peptides mimicking the third intracellular loop of the 5HT1a receptor which prevent hormonal adenylyl cyclase inhibition (19Varrault A. Le Nguyen D. McClue S. Harris B. Jouin P. Bockaert J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16720-16725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and also the interactions between other classes of proteins like actin-tropomyosin and calponin (20Mezgueldi M. Mendre C. Calas B. Kassab R. Fattoum A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8867-8876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To further delineate the vasopressin binding site of the V1a vasopressin receptor, we elected to follow an approach similar to that described above. Thus, we synthesized peptides corresponding to extracellular regions of the rat V1avasopressin receptor (N-terminal sequence and hydrophilic extracellular loops) and examined their ability to alter specific vasopressin binding to V1a vasopressin receptor and to modify vasopressin-stimulated phospholipase C activity. Our data indicate that some synthetic peptides and particularly one fragment of the second extracellular loop with an additional cysteine residue exhibited antagonistic properties. We studied the mechanisms involved in such inhibition. Tritiated [Arg8]vasopressin (60 Ci/mmol) ([3H]AVP)andmyo-[3H]inositol (10–20 Ci/mmol) were obtained from NEN Life Science Products; OH-LVA, a specific V1a vasopressin antagonist (2000 Ci/mol), and Sar-AngII, an angiotensin II antagonist (2000 Ci/mmol), were radioiodinated using the IODO-GEN technique as described previously (21Manning M. Bankowski K. Barberis C. Jard S. Elands J. Chan W.Y. Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. 1992; 40: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 22Fraker P.J. Speck J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 80: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (3623) Google Scholar). [Arg8]Vasopressin was obtained from Bachem. The peptides Nt-(50–79) (deriving from the N-terminal part of the bovine endothelin A receptor) and GLP (a glucagon-like-peptide) were synthesized and characterized in the laboratory by solid phase peptide synthesis as described previously (23Mendre C. Hamroun D. Dupoirieux L. Calas B. Chevillard C. Peptides. 1996; 17: 521-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 24Bell G.I. Santerre R.F. Mullenbach G.T. Nature. 1983; 302: 716-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Dowex AG1-X8 (100–200-mesh), chloride form, was obtained from Fluka. Affinity chromatography was performed with Affi-GelR 10 gel from Bio-Rad. All other chemicals were of A-grade purity. All peptides were obtained by solid phase peptide synthesis, using two different procedures. The fluoromethoxycarbonyl strategy consisted in using a continuous flow procedure in an automated solid-phase synthesizer (PepSynthesizer 9050, from Perseptive Biosystems, Millipore) (25Valembois C. Mendre C. Cavadore J.C. Calas B. Tetrahedron Lett. 1992; 33: 4005-4008Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The resin was Fmoc-Amino-Acid-PAL-PEG-PSRfrom Perseptive Biosystems, Millipore (1 g of 0.2 mmol NH2/g). We used free αCO2H amino acids (0.6 mmol) with temporary protection on the αNH2 and the side-chain protections as follows: pentamethylchromanesulfonyl for Arg; trityl for Cys, Asn, and Gln; tertiobutyloxycarbonyl for Lys; tertiobutyl ether for Ser, Thr, and Tyr; tertiobutyl ester for Asp and Glu. The coupling agent used was 2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (0.6 mmol) and diisopropylethylamine as base (1.2 mmol). After the completion of the synthesis, the peptides were deprotected and cleaved from the support using K reagent (CF3COOH/phenol/water/thioanisole/ethanedithiol, 85/5/2.5/2.5, v/v) for 0.5–4 h, depending on the presence or not of Arg(pentamethylchroman sulfonyl) in the sequence. The tertiobutyloxycarbonyl strategy was carried out using either an automated solid-phase synthesizer (Applied Biosystems 430A) or a manual device as described previously (26Seyer R. Aumelas A. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1990; 1: 3289-3299Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The resin used was ap-methylbenzhydrylamine polystyrene from Bachem (1 g of 1.1 mmol NH2/g for automatic synthesis, and 3 g of 0.6 mmol NH2/g of titratable amine for manual synthesis). We used αCO2H amino acids (2.2 and 3.6 mmol for automatic and manual synthesis, respectively) with the following side-chain protections: p-toluenesulfonyl for Arg;p-methylbenzyl for Cys, benzyl for Ser and Thr, cyclohexyl for Glu and Asp, o,o-dichlorobenzyl for Tyr, ando-chlorobenzyloxycarbonyl for Lys with (benzotriazolyloxy)tripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate as coupling agent (2.2 or 3.6 mmol for automatic or manual synthesis, respectively) (27Coste J. Le-Nguyen D. Castro B. Tetrahedron Lett. 1990; 31: 205-208Crossref Scopus (639) Google Scholar) and diisopropylethylamine as base (4.4 or 7.2 mmol for automatic or manual synthesis, respectively). The coupling efficiency was usually evaluated by the colorimetric Kaiser test. In this strategy, the deprotection was performed by CF3COOH/CH2Cl2/ethanedithiol (50/47/3, v/v) for 2 and 28 min, and finally 60 min in HF/anisole/dimethylsulfide (9/0.8/0.2, v/v). Peptides were purified by reverse phase HPLC. Analytical HPLC was performed using a C18 cartridge and linear CH3CN/H2O/0.1% CF3COOH (v/v) gradients as described previously (28Carnazzi E. Aumelas A. Barberis C. Guillon G. Seyer R. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 1841-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Preparative runs were performed using linear gradients of CH3CN in H2O, acidified (pH 2–3) by 0.1% CF3COOH. The purified peptide structure was checked via amino acid analysis, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS, VG FISONS, TRIO 2000) as described previously (29Evershed R.P. Robertson D.H.L. Beynon R.J. Green B.N. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1993; 7: 882-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) or by fast atom bombardment (FAB-MS, JEOL, SX 102). For the ESI-MS method, determination of the peptide true molecular weight from the raw m/z data was performed using VG TRIO 2000 mass spectrometer with Maxent software (29Evershed R.P. Robertson D.H.L. Beynon R.J. Green B.N. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1993; 7: 882-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). For the FAB-MS, determination of the true molecular weight was derived from the (MH+) peak of the fragmentation profile. Peptide quantification was performed by weighing, assuming CF3COOH as counter-ion in the lyophilized compounds, but without considering any hydration of the peptides. The e2-(194–218)C peptide was treated with iodoacetamide, as described previously (30Gray W.R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1732-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), to block its cysteinyl residues. This technique was preferred toN-ethylmaleimide blockade, since it introduced a reduced steric modification with no additional charge on the native peptide. Animals used in this study were female Wistar rats (160–180 g body weight). Purified plasma membranes from liver were prepared according to the procedure of Neville (31Neville D.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 154: 540-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar) up to step 11. They were stored in liquid nitrogen. Crude plasma membranes from the inner kidney medulla or from the adenohypophysis were prepared according to Butlen (4Butlen D. Guillon G. Rajerison R.M. Jard S. Sawyer W. Manning M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1978; 14: 1006-1017PubMed Google Scholar) and Jard (6Jard S. Gaillard R.C. Guillon G. Marie J. Schoenenberg P. Muller A.F. Manning M. Sawyer W.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1986; 30: 171-177PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. Briefly, the tissues were homogenized at 4 °C in an isotonic buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 5 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mmEDTA, 0.1 mm phenymethylsulfonyl fluoride, using a glass/glass Potter-Elvehjem. The extracts were then centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min at 3500 rpm. The supernatants were discarded and pellets resuspended in a large volume of hypotonic buffer, the composition of which was similar to the one described above, but without sucrose. After a 20-min incubation at 0 °C, extracts were centrifuged under the same conditions. Resulting pellets were resuspended in the hypotonic medium and centrifuged again. These pellets were collected, resuspended in hypotonic medium (1 mg of protein/ml), and used immediately for binding experiments. WRK1 cells, a rat mammary tumor cell line, were cultured as described previously (32Guillon G. Kirk C.J. Balestre M.N. Biochem. J. 1986; 240: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated at a density of 105 cells/dish in a modified minimum essential medium, containing 5% calf serum, 2% rat serum, 290 mg/ml glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. They were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere (5% CO2, 95% air). Two days after plating, the culture medium was removed and replaced by a fresh one containing 1 μCi/mlmyo-[3H]inositol and cells were used 2 days thereafter. [3H]AVP binding to plasma membrane preparations was performed as described previously (4Butlen D. Guillon G. Rajerison R.M. Jard S. Sawyer W. Manning M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1978; 14: 1006-1017PubMed Google Scholar, 6Jard S. Gaillard R.C. Guillon G. Marie J. Schoenenberg P. Muller A.F. Manning M. Sawyer W.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1986; 30: 171-177PubMed Google Scholar, 33Cantau B. Keppens S. De Wulf H. Jard S. J. Recept. Res. 1980; 1: 137-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Briefly, kidney, adenohypophysis or liver membrane preparations (30–60 μg of protein/assay) were incubated 1 h at 37 °C in 200 μl of a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mm phenymethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 nm[3H]AVP, and increasing amounts of vasopressin receptor fragments (total binding determinations). An excess of unlabeled AVP (1 μm) was also added in the incubation medium to determine the nonspecific binding. The reaction was initiated by adding the membranes, stopped by addition of 4 ml of cold washing solution (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 3 mm MgCl2), and immediately filtered onto Whatman glass fiber (0.8–1.2 μm) previously presoaked 2 h with 10 mg/ml BSA. The filters were then rinsed three times with 4 ml of the washing solution and the remaining radioactivity, measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The specific binding was calculated as the difference between the total and nonspecific values. 125I-OH-LVA binding was performed as described previously (21Manning M. Bankowski K. Barberis C. Jard S. Elands J. Chan W.Y. Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. 1992; 40: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1–2 μg of rat liver membranes were incubated 1 h at 37 °C in 200 μl of the same incubation medium as the one described above. [3H]AVP was replaced with a single concentration of 125I-OH-LVA (concentration-displacement experiments) or increasing amounts of125I-OH-LVA (concentration-dependent binding experiments). The concentration of 125I-OH-LVA used in the displacement experiments was around 20 pm, a value corresponding to the Kd of this labeled analogue for the rat liver V1a vasopressin receptor (21Manning M. Bankowski K. Barberis C. Jard S. Elands J. Chan W.Y. Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. 1992; 40: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Binding experiments were carried out as described for [3H]AVP, except that radioactivity was measured using a γ counter. To verify if our binding assay conditions outlined the kinetic equilibrium conditions between the synthetic peptides and the hormonal receptor, we tested the influence of a preincubation between the synthetic peptides and the plasma membranes, prior addition of125I-OH-LVA. As shown in Fig. 1 A, a 30-min preincubation at 37 °C did not modify the ability of e2-(194–218)C to inhibit 125I-OH-LVA specific binding. These results validate the experimental protocol chosen for measuring the interactions between the synthetic peptides and the hormonal receptor. To further characterize such interactions, we also calculated the Hill coefficient for the e2-(194–218)C peptide, as described previously (33Cantau B. Keppens S. De Wulf H. Jard S. J. Recept. Res. 1980; 1: 137-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). As illustrated on Fig. 1 B, the Hill coefficient was found independent from the preincubation conditions. Its value (1.14 ± 0.07, n = 7) was near to unit, suggesting a single site binding interaction. Similar results were also obtained with the same synthetic peptide on rat liver plasma membrane using [3H]AVP as radioligand (Hill coefficient = 1.11 ± 0.09, n = 5) (data not shown). 125I-Sar-AngII binding was performed on rat liver membranes as described for 125I-OH-LVA. The concentration of labeled hormone used in this assay was around 0.2 nm, a value similar to the Kd of this analogue for rat liver AngII receptor (22Fraker P.J. Speck J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 80: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (3623) Google Scholar). As described previously (34Kirk C.J. Guillon G. Balestre M.N. Jard S. Biochem. J. 1986; 240: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), myo-[3H]inositol-prelabeled WRK1 cells were incubated for 45 min, at 37 °C in a culture medium deprived of myo-[3H]inositol and sera, washed twice with 1.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then preincubated 15 min at 37 °C with 0.7 ml of PBS supplemented with: 1 g/liter glucose, 10 mm LiCl, 1 mg/ml BSA, and the vasopressin receptor fragments tested. AVP (1 nm) was then added to the incubation medium for an additional 6-min period. Perchloric acid (5% final concentration) together with 0.1 ml of BSA (20 mg/ml) were added to the incubation medium to stop the reaction. Cells were scraped and cellular extracts centrifuged. Labeled mono-, bis-, and triphosphate inositol present in the supernatant were separated from inositol and glycerophosphoinositides using Dowex AG1-X8 columns and measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry as described previously (34Kirk C.J. Guillon G. Balestre M.N. Jard S. Biochem. J. 1986; 240: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Data presented are the mean of triplicate determinations. The standard error (S.E.) associated to each experimental value never exceeded 10% both for binding and inositol phosphate accumulation measurements. The number of distinct experiments performed (n) is indicated in parentheses. Determination of the apparent dissociation constant (Ki(app)) for the vasopressin receptor fragments was calculated as described previously (33Cantau B. Keppens S. De Wulf H. Jard S. J. Recept. Res. 1980; 1: 137-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), assuming a direct competition between the vasopressin receptor fragment and labeled AVP or OH-LVA molecules for the vasopressin receptor binding sites. Briefly, the concentration of vasopressin fragment leading to half-maximal specific binding inhibition of labeled hormone (ED50) was determined by concentration-displacement experiments and its Ki(app), calculated according to the Cheng-Prusoff equation:Ki(app) = ED50 ×Kd/(Kd + [H*]), whereKd is the dissociation constant of the labeled ligand used for the vasopressin receptor considered and [H*] the concentration of the labeled hormone used in the assay. We prepared synthetic fragments of the rat V1a vasopressin receptor from the primary sequence published (8Morel A. O'Carroll A.M. Brownstein M.J. Lolait S.J. Nature. 1992; 356: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). These peptides (from 13 to 51 residues) mainly corresponded to hydrophilic extracellular sequences of the rat V1a receptor. The C termini of the synthetic peptides, for which length did not exceed 26 residues, were amidated to suppress the carboxyl negative charge not present in the corresponding domain of the native protein. The putative importance of cysteine residues in the receptor binding domain (35Pàvò I. Fahrenholz F. FEBS Lett. 1990; 272: 205-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), led us to synthesize “modified peptides.” They were either cysteinylated (addition of a C-terminal extra-cysteinyl residue) or alkylated by iodoacetamide (blockade of cysteinyl residues). The sequences and the abbreviations of the peptides are summarized in Table I. Peptide purity was determined by analytical HPLC and evaluated to be higher than 98%, as can be shown for e2-(194–218)C peptide (Fig. 2,inset). Moreover, amino acid analysis of each peptide is in good agreement with its sequence (data not shown). Finally, the mass of each peptide was confirmed using mass spectrometry. As shown in Table II, the experimental mass values found for each peptide corresponded to the calculated mass.
