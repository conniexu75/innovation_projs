https://openalex.org/W2782255969,"Two-dimensional (2D) heterojunctions display a remarkable potential for application in high performance, low power electro-optical systems. p-n junctions based on vertically stacked heterostructures have shown very promising performance as tunneling transistors, light emitting devices and photodetectors, and as photovoltaic cells . Although complex vertical heterostructures were fabricated via van der Waals stacking of different 2D materials, atomically sharp multi-junctions in lateral heterostructures is a quite challenging task, but a viable route towards the development of commercial applications. Previously reported approaches to obtain single-junction lateral heterostructures of the type MoX2-WX2 (X= S and/or Se), involve either a single-step or a two-step growth process. However, these methods lack the flexibility to control the lateral width of the TMD domain as well as its composition. Here, we report a simple and yet scalable synthesis approach for the fabrication of lateral multi-junction heterostructures based on the combination of different TMD monolayers [MoX2-WX2 (X2 = S2, Se2 or SSe)]. Atomically sharp lateral junctions are sequentially synthesized from solid precursors by changing only the reactive gas environment in the presence of water vapor. This allows to selectively control the water-induced oxidation, volatilization and hence the relative amount of a specific metal oxide vapor, leading to the selective edge-epitaxial growth of either MoX2 or WX2. Spatially dependent photoluminescence and atomic-resolution images confirm the high crystallinity of the monolayers and the seamless lateral connectivity between the different TMD domains. These findings could be extended to other families of 2D materials, and creates the foundation towards the development of complex and atomically thin in-plane super-lattices, devices and integrated circuits."
https://openalex.org/W2781846354,"When a two-dimensional electron gas is exposed to a perpendicular magnetic field and an in-plane electric field, its conductance becomes quantized in the transverse in-plane direction: this is known as the quantum Hall (QH) effect. This effect is a result of the nontrivial topology of the system's electronic band structure, where an integer topological invariant known as the first Chern number leads to the quantization of the Hall conductance. Interestingly, it was shown that the QH effect can be generalized mathematically to four spatial dimensions (4D), but this effect has never been realized for the obvious reason that experimental systems are bound to three spatial dimensions. In this work, we harness the high tunability and control offered by photonic waveguide arrays to experimentally realize a dynamically-generated 4D QH system using a 2D array of coupled optical waveguides. The inter-waveguide separation is constructed such that the propagation of light along the device samples over higher-dimensional momenta in the directions orthogonal to the two physical dimensions, thus realizing a 2D topological pump. As a result, the device's band structure is associated with 4D topological invariants known as second Chern numbers which support a quantized bulk Hall response with a 4D symmetry. In a finite-sized system, the 4D topological bulk response is carried by localized edges modes that cross the sample as a function of of the modulated auxiliary momenta. We directly observe this crossing through photon pumping from edge-to-edge and corner-to-corner of our system. These are equivalent to the pumping of charge across a 4D system from one 3D hypersurface to the opposite one and from one 2D hyperedge to another, and serve as first experimental realization of higher-dimensional topological physics."
https://openalex.org/W2617026648,"By implementing a 2D topological charge pump using ultracold bosonic atoms, the theoretically predicted 4D integer quantum Hall effect is confirmed experimentally. The quantum Hall effect, discovered in the 1980s, is an important fundamental effect in condensed matter physics that links topological states with electronic properties in two-dimensional systems. The quantized conductance is prescribed by an integer global topological invariant and is therefore protected against perturbations. Such invariants are characterized by a so-called Chern number. Two papers in this issue experimentally confirm the prediction that the quantum Hall effect can be generalized to a four-dimensional (4D) system. Immanuel Bloch and colleagues implement the 4D quantum Hall system in a superlattice of ultracold bosonic atoms, and Mikael Rechtsman and colleagues achieve the same in a photonic waveguide array. Both groups find that their system harbours a second Chern number, as expected. The studies show an intriguing advance towards new physics provided by topological protection in higher dimensions. The discovery of topological states of matter has greatly improved our understanding of phase transitions in physical systems. Instead of being described by local order parameters, topological phases are described by global topological invariants and are therefore robust against perturbations. A prominent example is the two-dimensional (2D) integer quantum Hall effect1: it is characterized by the first Chern number, which manifests in the quantized Hall response that is induced by an external electric field2. Generalizing the quantum Hall effect to four-dimensional (4D) systems leads to the appearance of an additional quantized Hall response, but one that is nonlinear and described by a 4D topological invariant—the second Chern number3,4. Here we report the observation of a bulk response with intrinsic 4D topology and demonstrate its quantization by measuring the associated second Chern number. By implementing a 2D topological charge pump using ultracold bosonic atoms in an angled optical superlattice, we realize a dynamical version of the 4D integer quantum Hall effect5,6. Using a small cloud of atoms as a local probe, we fully characterize the nonlinear response of the system via in situ imaging and site-resolved band mapping. Our findings pave the way to experimentally probing higher-dimensional quantum Hall systems, in which additional strongly correlated topological phases, exotic collective excitations and boundary phenomena such as isolated Weyl fermions are predicted4."
https://openalex.org/W2748749400,"Dodders (Cuscuta spp.) are obligate parasitic plants that obtain water and nutrients from the stems of host plants via specialized feeding structures called haustoria. Dodder haustoria facilitate bidirectional movement of viruses, proteins and mRNAs between host and parasite, but the functional effects of these movements are not known. Here we show that Cuscuta campestris haustoria accumulate high levels of many novel microRNAs (miRNAs) while parasitizing Arabidopsis thaliana. Many of these miRNAs are 22 nucleotides in length. Plant miRNAs of this length are uncommon, and are associated with amplification of target silencing through secondary short interfering RNA (siRNA) production. Several A. thaliana mRNAs are targeted by 22-nucleotide C. campestris miRNAs during parasitism, resulting in mRNA cleavage, secondary siRNA production, and decreased mRNA accumulation. Hosts with mutations in two of the loci that encode target mRNAs supported significantly higher growth of C. campestris. The same miRNAs that are expressed and active when C. campestris parasitizes A. thaliana are also expressed and active when it infects Nicotiana benthamiana. Homologues of target mRNAs from many other plant species also contain the predicted target sites for the induced C. campestris miRNAs. These data show that C. campestris miRNAs act as trans-species regulators of host-gene expression, and suggest that they may act as virulence factors during parasitism."
https://openalex.org/W2782137090,"The mammalian microbiome has many important roles in health and disease, and genetic engineering is enabling the development of microbial therapeutics and diagnostics. A key determinant of the activity of both natural and engineered microorganisms in vivo is their location within the host organism. However, existing methods for imaging cellular location and function, primarily based on optical reporter genes, have limited deep tissue performance owing to light scattering or require radioactive tracers. Here we introduce acoustic reporter genes, which are genetic constructs that allow bacterial gene expression to be visualized in vivo using ultrasound, a widely available inexpensive technique with deep tissue penetration and high spatial resolution. These constructs are based on gas vesicles, a unique class of gas-filled protein nanostructures that are expressed primarily in water-dwelling photosynthetic organisms as a means to regulate buoyancy. Heterologous expression of engineered gene clusters encoding gas vesicles allows Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium to be imaged noninvasively at volumetric densities below 0.01% with a resolution of less than 100 μm. We demonstrate the imaging of engineered cells in vivo in proof-of-concept models of gastrointestinal and tumour localization, and develop acoustically distinct reporters that enable multiplexed imaging of cellular populations. This technology equips microbial cells with a means to be visualized deep inside mammalian hosts, facilitating the study of the mammalian microbiome and the development of diagnostic and therapeutic cellular agents."

https://openalex.org/W2782310455,"Although yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ), nuclear transducers of the Hippo pathway, are mostly silent in adult organs, aberrant activation of YAP/TAZ promotes tumorigenesis and abnormal tissue repair. The extent of involvement of TAZ in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is unknown. In our study, increased TAZ nuclear accumulation and expression in the tubulointerstitium was readily evident in 3 models of renal injury including obstructive, aristolochic acid (AA), and diabetic nephropathy, correlating with fibrosis progression. Stable TAZ overexpression in human kidney (HK)-2 epithelial cells promoted connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), fibronectin, vimentin, and p21 expression, epithelial dedifferentiation, and growth inhibition, in part, via Sma mothers against decapentaplegic homologue (SMAD)-3-dependent CTGF induction. CTGF secretion by TAZ-overexpressing epithelium also triggered proliferative defects in nonengineered HK-2 cells confirming a nonautonomous role of TAZ (via a paracrine mechanism) in orchestrating kidney epithelial cell-cell communication. Renal tubular-specific induction of TGF-β1 in mice and TGF-β1 stimulation of HK-2 cells resulted in TAZ protein up-regulation. TAZ stable silencing in HK-2 cells abrogated TGF-β1–induced expression of target genes without affecting SMAD3 phosphorylation, which is also crucial for fibrotic reprogramming. Thus, TAZ was activated in fibrosis through TGF-β1–dependent mechanisms and sustained TAZ signaling promotes epithelial maladaptive repair. TAZ is also a novel non-SMAD downstream effector of renal TGF-β1 signaling, establishing TAZ as a new antifibrosis target for treatment of CKD.—Anorga, S., Overstreet, J. M., Falke, L.

https://openalex.org/W2781594566,"Studies have found that adolescents living with HIV are at risk of depression, which in turn affects adherence to medication. This study explored the experience and manifestation of depression in adolescents living with HIV in Zimbabwe in order to inform intervention development.We conducted a body mapping exercise with 21 HIV positive 15-19 years olds who had been diagnosed with major depressive disorder. Participants created a painted map of their body to assist them in expressing their somatic and emotional experiences in qualitative interviews. The interviews were transcribed and thematically coded using NVivo 10.Participants attributed their experiences of depression to their relationships and interactions with significant people in their lives, primarily family members and peers. A sense of being different from others was common among participants, both due to their HIV status and the impact HIV has had on their life circumstances. Participants described a longing to be important or to matter to the people in their lives. A sense of isolation and rejection was common, as well as grief and loss, including ambiguous and anticipated loss. Participants' idioms of distress included 'thinking deeply' ('kufungisisa'), 'pain', darkness, 'stress' or a lack of hope and ambiguity for the future. Suicidal ideation was described, including slow suicide through poor adherence. Supportive factors were also relational, including the importance of supportive relatives and peers, clinic staff and psychosocial support programmes.An understanding of HIV positive adolescents' own narratives around depression can inform the development and integration of appropriate mental health interventions within HIV care and treatment programmes. Study findings suggest that family and peer-led interventions are potentially useful in the prevention and management of depression in adolescents living with HIV."
https://openalex.org/W2782247966,"Bacterial antibiotic resistance is an emerging public health problem worldwide; therefore, new therapeutic strategies are needed. Many studies have described antipsychotic compounds that present antibacterial activity. Hence, the aims of this study were to evaluate the in vitro antibacterial activity of antipsychotics belonging to different chemical families, to assess the influence of their association with lipid nanocapsules (LNCs) on their antimicrobial activity as well as drug release and to study the uptake of LNCs by bacterial cells. Antibacterial activity was evaluated against Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and Gram negative Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assay, and the capability of killing tested microorganisms was evaluated by time kill assay. LNCs were prepared by phase inversion method, and the antipsychotic agents were incorporated using pre-loading and post-loading strategies. Only phenothiazines and thioxanthenes showed antibacterial activity, which was independent of antibiotic-resistance patterns. Loading the nanocarriers with the drugs affected the properties of the former, particularly their zeta potential. The release rate depended on the drug and its concentration—a maximum of released drug of less than 40% over 24 hours was observed for promazine. The influence of the drug associations on the antibacterial properties was concentration-dependent since, at low concentrations (high nanocarrier/drug ratio), the activity was lost, probably due to the high affinity of the drug to nanocarriers and slow release rate, whereas at higher concentrations, the activity was well maintained for the majority of the drugs. Chlorpromazine and thioridazine increased the uptake of the LNCs by bacteria compared with blank LNCs, even below the minimum inhibitory concentration."
https://openalex.org/W2781944170,"Stimuli such as inflammation or hypoxia induce cytochrome P450 epoxygenase-mediated production of arachidonic acid–derived epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs). EETs have cardioprotective, vasodilatory, angiogenic, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic effects, which are diminished by EET hydrolysis yielding biologically less active dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHETs). Previous in vitro assays have suggested that epoxide hydrolase 2 (EPHX2) is responsible for nearly all EET hydrolysis. EPHX1, which exhibits slow EET hydrolysis in vitro, is thought to contribute only marginally to EET hydrolysis. Using Ephx1−/−, Ephx2−/−, and Ephx1−/−Ephx2−/− mice, we show here that EPHX1 significantly contributes to EET hydrolysis in vivo. Disruption of Ephx1 and/or Ephx2 genes did not induce compensatory changes in expression of other Ephx genes or CYP2 family epoxygenases. Plasma levels of 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-DHET were reduced by 38, 44, and 67% in Ephx2−/− mice compared with wildtype (WT) mice, respectively; however, plasma from Ephx1−/−Ephx2−/− mice exhibited significantly greater reduction (100, 99, and 96%) of those respective DHETs. Kinetic assays and FRET experiments indicated that EPHX1 is a slow EET scavenger, but hydrolyzes EETs in a coupled reaction with cytochrome P450 to limit basal EET levels. Moreover, we also found that EPHX1 activities are biologically relevant, as Ephx1−/−Ephx2−/− hearts had significantly better postischemic functional recovery (71%) than both WT (31%) and Ephx2−/− (51%) hearts. These findings indicate that Ephx1−/−Ephx2−/− mice are a valuable model for assessing EET-mediated effects, uncover a new paradigm for EET metabolism, and suggest that dual EPHX1 and EPHX2 inhibition may represent a therapeutic approach to manage human pathologies such as myocardial infarction.

https://openalex.org/W2782531296,"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is believed to play an important role in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The accumulation of misfolded proteins and perturbation of intracellular calcium homeostasis are thought to underlie the induction of ER stress, resulting in neuronal dysfunction and cell death. Several reports have shown an increased ER stress response in amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin1 (PS1) double-transgenic (Tg) AD mouse models. However, whether the ER stress observed in these mouse models is actually caused by AD pathology remains unclear. APP and PS1 contain one and nine transmembrane domains, respectively, for which it has been postulated that overexpressed membrane proteins can become wedged in a misfolded configuration in ER membranes, thereby inducing nonspecific ER stress. Here, we used an App-knockin (KI) AD mouse model that accumulates amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide without overexpressing APP to investigate whether the ER stress response is heightened because of Aβ pathology. Thorough examinations indicated that no ER stress responses arose in App-KI or single APP-Tg mice. These results suggest that PS1 overexpression or mutation induced a nonspecific ER stress response that was independent of Aβ pathology in the double-Tg mice. Moreover, we observed no ER stress in a mouse model of tauopathy (P301S-Tau-Tg mice) at various ages, suggesting that ER stress is also not essential in tau pathology–induced neurodegeneration. We conclude that the role of ER stress in AD pathogenesis needs to be carefully addressed in future studies."
https://openalex.org/W2782241387,"The global antimicrobial resistance surveillance system (GLASS) was launched by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2015. GLASS is a surveillance system for clinical specimens that are sent to microbiology laboratory for clinical purposes. The unique feature of GLASS is that clinical data is combined with microbiological data, and deduplication of the microbiological results is performed. The objective of the study was to determine feasibility and benefit of GLASS for surveillance of blood culture specimens. GLASS was implemented at Siriraj Hospital in Bangkok, Thailand using a locally developed web application program (app) to transfer blood culture specimen data, and to enter clinical data of patients with positive blood culture by infection control nurses and physicians via the app installed in their smart phones. The rate of positive blood culture specimens with true infection was 15.2%. Escherichia coli was the most common cause of bacteremia. Secondary bacteremia, primary bacteremia, and central line-associated blood stream infection was observed in 61.8%, 30.6%, and 12.6% of cases, respectively. Sepsis was observed in 56.9% of patients. E.coli was significantly more common in community-acquired bacteremia, whereas Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and Acinetobacter baumannii were significantly more common in hospital-acquired bacteremia. Hospital-acquired isolates of E.coli, K.pneumoniae, A.baumannii, P.aeruginosa, S.aureus and Enterococcus faecium were more resistant to antibiotics than community-acquired isolates. In-hospital mortality was significantly higher in patients with antibiotic-resistant bacteremia than in patients with antibiotic non-resistant bacteremia (40.5% vs. 28.5%, p<0.001). The patients with antibiotic-resistant bacteremia consumed more resources than those with antibiotic non-resistant bacteremia. Blood culture results combined with patient clinical data were shown to have more benefit for surveillance of antimicrobial resistance, and to be more applicable for developing local antibiotic treatment guidelines for patients suspected of having bacteremia. However, GLASS consumed more time and more resources than the conventional laboratory-based surveillance system."

They provided information about their knowledge of Zika transmission and health consequences, their receipt of counseling related to sexual and perinatal transmission of Zika, their pregnancy intentions and reassessment of contraceptive options in the context of the Zika virus outbreak.Awareness about Zika congenital syndrome was high, but knowledge about sexual transmission was low. Few women had changed pregnancy intentions or contraceptive practices in response to Zika. Pregnant women were more likely to access counseling about family planning, condom use and pregnancy postponement due to Zika virus than non-pregnant women, which may suggest that health system responses followed pregnancy occurrence.We observed missed opportunities for prevention of perinatal transmission of Zika virus through behavioral change, including effective contraception to prevent pregnancy and condoms to prevent perinatal transmission, as a complement to vector control."

In the present study, we demonstrated that the CXXC motif exists in oxidized and reduced states in the recombinant enzyme by mass spectroscopic analysis and a thiol labeling assay. The activity of reduced CBS is ˜2–3-fold greater than that of the oxidized enzyme, and substitution of either cysteine in CXXC motif leads to a loss of redox sensitivity.

By contrast, incubation of cells with aminooxyacetic acid, an inhibitor of CBS and cystathionine γ-lyase, eliminated the increase of H2S production after the cells were exposed to DTT.

We conducted an observational cross-sectional study to evaluate the relationship between ABSI, HI and cardiometabolic risk factors and obesity-related comorbidities in overweight and obese children and adolescents aged 2-18 years. We performed multivariate linear and logistic regression analyses with BMI, ABSI, and HI age and sex normalized z scores as predictors to examine the association with cardiometabolic risk markers (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fasting glucose and insulin, total cholesterol and its components, transaminases, fat mass % detected by bioelectrical impedance analysis) and obesity-related conditions (including hepatic steatosis and metabolic syndrome). We recruited 217 patients (114 males), mean age 11.3 years. Multivariate linear regression showed a significant association of ABSI z score with 10 out of 15 risk markers expressed as continuous variables, while BMI z score showed a significant correlation with 9 and HI only with 1. In multivariate logistic regression to predict occurrence of obesity-related conditions and above-threshold values of risk factors, BMI z score was significantly correlated to 7 out of 12, ABSI to 5, and HI to 1. Overall, ABSI is an independent anthropometric index that was significantly associated with cardiometabolic risk markers in a pediatric population affected by overweight and obesity."

https://openalex.org/W2782178515,"NQO1 is a FAD containing NAD(P)H-dependent oxidoreductase that catalyzes the reduction of quinones and related substrates. In cells, NQO1 participates in a number of binding interactions with other proteins and mRNA and these interactions may be influenced by the concentrations of reduced pyridine nucleotides. NAD(P)H can protect NQO1 from proteolytic digestion suggesting that binding of reduced pyridine nucleotides results in a change in NQO1 structure. We have used purified NQO1 to demonstrate the addition of NAD(P)H induces a change in the structure of NQO1; this results in the loss of immunoreactivity to antibodies that bind to the C-terminal domain and to helix 7 of the catalytic core domain. Under normal cellular conditions NQO1 is not immunoprecipitated by these antibodies, however, following treatment with β-lapachone which caused rapid oxidation of NAD(P)H NQO1 could be readily pulled-down. Similarly, immunostaining for NQO1 was significantly increased in cells following treatment with β-lapachone demonstrating that under non-denaturing conditions the immunoreactivity of NQO1 is reflective of the NAD(P)+/NAD(P)H ratio. In untreated human cells, regions with high intensity immunostaining for NQO1 co-localize with acetyl α-tubulin and the NAD+-dependent deacetylase Sirt2 on the centrosome(s), the mitotic spindle and midbody during cell division. These data provide evidence that during the centriole duplication cycle NQO1 may provide NAD+ for Sirt2-mediated deacetylation of microtubules. Overall, NQO1 may act as a redox-dependent switch where the protein responds to the NAD(P)+/NAD(P)H redox environment by altering its structure promoting the binding or dissociation of NQO1 with target macromolecules."

The expression and extracellular release of HMGB1 was rapidly and dramatically induced by saturated palmitic acid in vitro. HFD-induced inflammatory response and liver function impairment were both mitigated after the inhibition of endogenous HMGB1 by neutralizing antibody in vivo. The up-regulation of HMGB1 was thought to be modified by dual channels: in the transcriptional level, it was regulated by JNK1/JNK2-ATF2 axis; post-transcriptionally, it was regulated by the microRNA (miR)-200 family, especially miR-429. miR-429 liver conditional knockout mice (miR-429μhep), fed either a normal diet or an HFD, showed severe liver inflammation and dysfunction, accompanied by greater expression of HMGB1. Intriguingly, the up-regulation and release of HMGB1 could in turn self-activate TLR4–JNK1/JNK2–ATF2 signaling, thus forming a positive feedback. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism by which HMGB1 expression was regulated by both the JNK1/2–ATF2 axis and the miR-200 family, which provides a potential new approach for the treatment of NAFLD.—Chen, X., Ling, Y., Wei, Y., Tang, J., Ren, Y., Zhang, B., Jiang, F., Li, H., Wang, R., Wen, W., Lv, G., Wu, M., Chen, L., Li, L., Wang, H.

https://openalex.org/W2782382443,"Polyacrylamide gels functionalized with extracellular matrix proteins are commonly used as cell culture platforms to evaluate the combined effects of extracellular matrix composition, cell geometry and substrate rigidity on cell physiology. For this purpose, protein transfer onto the surface of polyacrylamide hydrogels must result in geometrically well-resolved micropatterns with homogeneous protein distribution. Yet the outcomes of micropatterning methods have not been pairwise evaluated against these criteria. We report a high-fidelity photoresist lift-off patterning method to pattern ECM proteins on polyacrylamide hydrogels with elastic moduli ranging from 5 to 25 kPa. We directly compare the protein transfer efficiency and pattern geometrical accuracy of this protocol to the widely used microcontact printing method. Lift-off patterning achieves higher protein transfer efficiency, increases pattern accuracy, increases pattern yield, and reduces variability of these factors within arrays of patterns as it bypasses the drying and transfer steps of microcontact printing. We demonstrate that lift-off patterned hydrogels successfully control cell size and shape and enable long-term imaging of actin intracellular structure and lamellipodia dynamics when we culture epithelial cells on these substrates."

Cytokine array–based screening identified interleukin 6 (IL-6) as a cytokine secreted by the SVF in a DDR1-dependent manner. SVF-produced IL-6 is important for SVF-stimulated tumor cell invasion in vitro, and, using antibody-based neutralization, we show that tumor promotion by IL-6 in vivo requires DDR1.

https://openalex.org/W2781578864,"Giraffe populations in East Africa have declined in the past thirty years yet there has been limited research on this species. This study had four objectives: i) to provide a baseline population assessment for the two largest populations of Rothschild's giraffes in Kenya, ii) to assess whether there are differences in population structure between the two enclosed populations, iii) to assess the potential and possible implications of different management practices on enclosed giraffe populations to inform future decision-making, and iv) to add to the availability of information available about giraffes in the wild. I used individual identification to assess the size and structure of the two populations; in Soysambu Conservancy between May 2010 and January 2011, I identified 77 giraffes; in Lake Nakuru National Park between May 2011 and January 2012, I identified 89. Population structure differed significantly between the two sites; Soysambu Conservancy contained a high percentage of juveniles (34%) and subadults (29%) compared to Lake Nakuru NP, which contained fewer juveniles (5%) and subadults (15%). During the time of this study Soysambu Conservancy contained no lions while Lake Nakuru NP contained a high density of lions (30 lions per 100km2). Lions are the main predator of giraffes, and preferential predation on juvenile giraffes has previously been identified in Lake Nakuru NP. My results suggest that high lion density in Lake Nakuru NP may have influenced the structure of the giraffe population by removing juveniles and, consequently, may affect future population growth. I suggest that wildlife managers consider lion densities alongside breeding plans for Endangered species, since the presence of lions appears to influence the population structure of giraffes in enclosed habitats."
https://openalex.org/W2782399698,"Despite their essential roles in signal processing in the brain, the functions of interneurons currently remain unclear in humans. We recently developed a method using the prepulse inhibition of sensory evoked cortical responses for functional measurements of interneurons. When a sensory feature is abruptly changed in a continuous sensory stimulus, change-related cortical responses are recorded using MEG. By inserting a weak change stimulus (prepulse) before the test change stimulus, it is possible to observe the inhibition of the test response. By manipulating the prepulse-test interval (PTI), several peaks appear in inhibition, suggesting the existence of temporally distinct mechanisms. We herein attempted to separate these components through the oral administration of diazepam and baclofen. The test stimulus and prepulse were an abrupt increase in sound pressure in a continuous click train of 10 and 5 dB, respectively. The results obtained showed that the inhibition at PTIs of 10 and 20 ms was significantly greater with diazepam than with the placebo administration, suggesting increased GABAA-mediated inhibition. Baclofen decreased inhibition at PTIs of 40 and 50 ms, which may have been due to the activation of GABAB autoreceptors. Therefore, the present study separated at least two inhibitory mechanisms pharmacologically."
https://openalex.org/W2781512152,"Ocean warming and acidification (OA) may alter the fitness of species in marine pelagic ecosystems through community effects or direct physiological impacts. We used the zooplanktonic appendicularian, Oikopleura dioica, to assess temperature and pH effects at mesocosm and microcosm scales. In mesocosms, both OA and warming positively impacted O. dioica abundance over successive generations. In microcosms, the positive impact of OA, was observed to result from increased fecundity. In contrast, increased pH, observed for example during phytoplankton blooms, reduced fecundity. Oocyte fertility and juvenile development were equivalent under all pH conditions, indicating that the positive effect of lower pH on O. dioica abundance was principally due to increased egg number. This effect was influenced by food quantity and quality, supporting possible improved digestion and assimilation at lowered pH. Higher temperature resulted in more rapid growth, faster maturation and earlier reproduction. Thus, increased temperature and reduced pH had significant positive impacts on O. dioica fitness through increased fecundity and shortened generation time, suggesting that predicted future ocean conditions may favour this zooplankton species."

The G143R missense substitution in connexin (Cx) 46 is associated with congenital Coppock cataracts; however, the underlying molecular mechanism is largely unknown. Here, we report that compared with WT Cx46, the G143R substitution abolishes hemichannel conductance in Xenopus oocytes and in HeLa cells. Moreover, this substitution is dominant-negative and inhibits conductance of WT Cx46. CD analysis indicated that the substitution greatly reduces the α-helical structure of the intracellular Cx46 loop domain. Protein pulldown assays and isothermal titration calorimetry revealed that this Cx46 domain directly interacts with calmodulin (CaM) in a Ca2+-dependent fashion, an observation confirmed by immunofluorescent co-localization of Cx46 with CaM. Interestingly, the G143R substitution enhanced the Cx46–CaM interaction and attenuated its abolishment by Ca2+ depletion. Moreover, Cx46 increased dye influx, and the G143R substitution augmented this effect. Inhibition of Ca2+-mediated CaM activation blocked hemichannel permeability. The membrane potential plays a crucial role in Cx46 membrane permeability. We found that the activity of hemichannels is detectable under rest and hyperpolarization conditions but is eliminated with depolarization. These results suggested that the G143R substitution impairs voltage-dependent electrical conductance and alters membrane permeability mediated by Cx46 hemichannels.

The lens is a clear part of the anterior eye that focuses light and images onto the retina. Cataracts, referring to the clouding of the lens, are responsible for 51% of world blindness according to World Health Organization data in 2010 (1Pascolini D. Mariotti S.P. Global estimates of visual impairment: 2010.Br. J. Ophthalmol. 2012; 96 (22133988): 614-61810.1136/bjophthalmol-2011-300539Crossref PubMed Scopus (2324) Google Scholar). The lens has three main parts: the capsule, the epithelial layer in the anterior portion, and fiber cells, which comprise the bulk of lens (2Forrester J. Dick A. Mcmenamin P. Lee W. The Eye: Basic Sciences in Practice. W.B. Saunders Company Ltd., London1996Google Scholar). Lens fiber cells communicate to each other and to the surface of the lens by gap junction channels and hemichannels. These channels allow small molecules (<1.2 kDa) like ions, second messenger, and metabolites to pass through (3Mathias R.T. White T.W. Gong X.

The lens is an avascular organ and thus relies in part upon gap junction channels and hemichannels to maintain its metabolic homeostasis and transparency. Hemichannels, also called connexins, are undocked halves of gap junction channels that are composed of six connexin molecules. Connexins are a family of structurally related transmembrane proteins with 21 identified members in the human and 20 identified members in the mouse. Each connexin protein has four transmembrane domains, two extracellular loop domains, and an N-terminal domain that are all highly conserved between different connexin members. However, the intracellular loop and C-terminal domains are highly diverse among connexin subtypes (6Goodenough D.A. Goliger J.A. Paul D.L. Connexins, connexons, and intercellular communication.Annu.

A large body of evidence has shown that connexin gene mutations (missense, nonsense, deletion, insertion, and frameshift) of Cx46 or Cx50 coding genes, GJA3 and GJA8, respectively, are a major cause of congenital cataracts (5Jiang J.X. Gap junctions or hemichannel-dependent and independent roles of connexins in cataractogenesis and lens development.Curr. Mol.

Most of the connexin mutations associated with cataracts are located in transmembrane and extracellular loop domains, including over 40 cataract-associated mutations of Cx46. Interestingly, the missense mutation G143R is located in the intracellular loop (IL) domain of Cx46. This mutation was identified in a four-generation Chinese family with congenital Coppock cataracts (9Zhang L. Qu X. Su S. Guan L. Liu P. A novel mutation in GJA3 associated with congenital Coppock-like cataract in a large Chinese family.Mol. Vis. 2012; 18 (22876138): 2114-2118PubMed Google Scholar). This is a special type of cataract in the posterior region of the lens between the nucleus and the posterior pole. Gly143 is a highly conserved amino acid residue across members of connexin family from various animal species. Our previous study has shown that the G143R mutation altered gap junction and hemichannel function, leading to decreased cell viability (10Ren Q. Riquelme M.A. Xu J. Yan X. Nicholson B.J. Gu S.

CaM is a ubiquitous, calcium-binding protein with various protein targets, allowing it to affect multiple cellular functions. It has four EF-hand Ca2+-binding motifs in its N and C domains. CaM undergoes a large conformational change after binding to Ca2+, which exposes hydrophobic patches, allowing binding to target proteins and initiating diverse downstream biological reactions. Connexins are also shown to associate with Ca2+/CaM as a part of gap junction complex (11Sotkis A. Wang X.G. Yasumura T. Peracchia L.L. Persechini A. Rash J.E. Peracchia C. Calmodulin colocalizes with connexins and plays a direct role in gap junction channel gating.Cell Commun.

Elevated intracellular Ca2+ concentration is long known to inhibit gap junction function in cardiac cells (12Noma A. Tsuboi N. Dependence of junctional conductance on proton, calcium and magnesium ions in cardiac paired cells of guinea-pig.J. Physiol. 1987; 382 (2442361): 193-21110.1113/jphysiol.1987.sp016363Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In this study, we showed by CD analysis that α-helical structural content was greatly reduced in the IL domain of Cx46 with G143R mutation. This mutation abolished voltage activation of Cx46 hemichannel electrical conductance while increasing hemichannel dye influx. Interestingly, this mutation enhanced the binding affinity between CaM and IL domain of Cx46 and reduced Ca2+ dependence of the interaction. Enhancement of the interaction between CaM and Cx46 resulting in altered hemichannel activity might be an underlying mechanism associated with the formation of cataracts. To test voltage-dependent hemichannel conductance by WT and G143R mutant of Cx46, membrane potential and transmembrane currents were measured in Xenopus oocytes injected with WT or mutant Cx46 cRNA or co-injected with both together. Comparable levels of expression of WT proteins, mutant proteins, or both together were detected by Western blotting analysis, whereas no expression of Cx46 was detected in non-injected oocytes (Fig. 1A). The resting membrane potentials of oocytes injected with WT and mutant Cx46 were more depolarized than those injected with water, indicating that WT and mutant Cx46 form permeable hemichannels (Fig. 1B). These data are consistent with previous publications from our and other labs showing leakage of hemichannels under resting membrane potential (10Ren Q. Riquelme M.A. Xu J. Yan X. Nicholson B.J. Gu S.

In voltage clamp mode, the oocytes that express WT Cx46 hemichannels display large outward currents at positive potentials. The resting potentials of oocytes injected with G143R mutant RNA, however, were slightly hyperpolarized compared with those injected with WT Cx46 RNA, whereas their transmembrane currents were negligible compared with those injected with water. Oocytes co-expressing WT and mutant Cx46 displayed significantly lower current amplitude than those expressing WT Cx46 alone, suggesting that Cx46G143R mutant has a dominant-negative effect on forming functional hemichannels when co-expressed with WT Cx46 (Fig. 1C). The voltage–current relationship of Xenopus oocytes alone or expressing Cx46, Cx46G143R, or both together shows that G143R mutant inhibited the ionic conductance induced by voltage in a dominant-negative manner (Fig. 1D). To dissect the effect of Cx46G143R on hemichannel gating in mammalian cells, we performed cell patch clamp to record whole-cell currents in HeLa cells expressing WT or G143R mutant (MT) of Cx46 (Fig. 2). We have previously shown that both WT and G143R mutant are localized on the cell surface in HeLa cells using cell surface biotinylation assay (10Ren Q. Riquelme M.A. Xu J. Yan X. Nicholson B.J. Gu S. Jiang J.X. Cataract-causing mutation of human connexin 46 impairs gap junction, but increases hemichannel function and cell death.PLoS One. 2013; 8 (24019978)e74732 10.1371/journal.pone.0074732Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Moreover, the amount of mutant is less on the cell surface than that of WT. Negative control (C) cells were recorded in HeLa cells transfected with empty vector. The currents were measured from a ramp voltage command of −110 to +110 mV in 8 s. Whole-cell current recorded in HeLa cells expressing WT Cx46 increased from 4 s compared with control cells with hardly detectable conductance, whereas HeLa cells expressing G143R mutant showed the similar non-detectable whole-cell patch clamp current as negative control cells (Fig. 2A). The peak amplitudes of outward and inward currents from C, WT, and mutant-expressing cells were also obtained; outward current peaks were much higher than inward peaks. The outward peak was significantly different between WT and C but not significantly different for inward peak, and there was no difference between C and mutant (Fig. 2C). This result showed an abolishment of hemichannel conductance in G143R mutant in HeLa cells. To understand the underlying molecular mechanism of this connexin mutation, we first determined the secondary structural changes caused by this mutation in the IL domain by using CD techniques. The secondary structure of the GST-fusion protein containing Cx46 IL domain of WT or G143R MT was determined using CD. Molar ellipticity of far UV CD spectra of purified GST protein and fusion proteins, WT, and MT of Cx46 IL domains was recorded at pH 6.5, 7, 7.5, and 8 (Fig. 3 and Fig. S1). GST protein did not contain any α-helical structure (Fig. S1). A typical α-helical structure characterized by two peaks at ˜209 and ˜222 nm was observed in the WT GST-Cx46 IL domain. However, the GST-Cx46G143R IL domain is loosely structured with a negative peak at 198 nm and a less notable broad curve at 210–220 nm (Fig. 3A). In comparison of molar ellipticity of CD spectra between the Cx46 IL domain of WT and mutant under various pH conditions at 208-nm wavelength, WT varied from −40 to −60 (deg cm2 dmol−1) and was responsive to pH with decreasing α-helical contents. Meanwhile, the spectra of MT remain at −20 (deg cm2 dmol−1) and unresponsive to pH changes (Fig. 3A, right bottom panel). These data indicate that G143R mutation reduces not only the α-helical content but also responsiveness of the IL domain to pH. We further determined responses of WT and MT versions of Cx46 IL domain to various Ca2+ concentrations (0–2.5 mm) in PBS (pH 7.5; Fig. 3B). The α-helical content of WT Cx46 IL decreased with the increase of Ca2+ concentration, especially at a Ca2+ concentration at 0–0.5 mm. In contrast, the MT IL domain was less responsive to Ca2+. Together, these results show that G143R decreases the α-helical content of the IL domain and appears to lose sensitivity to pH and Ca2+. The G143R mutation is located in the CaM-binding pocket in the IL domain. CaM is known to influence gap junction channel gating (15Bennett M.V. Barrio L.C. Bargiello T.A. Spray D.C. Hertzberg E. Sáez J.C. Gap junctions: new tools, new answers, new questions.Neuron. 1991; 6 (1848077): 305-32010.1016/0896-6273(91)90241-QAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). Protein pulldown assays were performed to determine the interaction between the Cx46 IL domain of WT or the G143R mutant with Ca2+–CaM. Comparable levels of 7-His-tagged peptide containing Cx46 IL domain of WT or G143R mutant were immobilized on Ni-NTA beads (Fig. 4A, lower panel). Two concentrations of purified CaM protein, 1 and 3 μg, were incubated with a 7-His-WT or 7-His-G143R mutant fusion protein. More CaM was pulled down by Cx46 IL domain containing G143R mutation than WT with a minimal amount of CaM (Fig. 4A, upper panel). The co-immunoprecipitation data further confirmed the observation (Fig. 4B). Cx46 immunoprecipitated more CaM in cell lysates expressing mutant than WT proteins (Fig. 4B, lower panel, IP: Cx46 Ab), although cell lysates contained similar levels of Cx46 protein (Fig. 4B, upper panel, Preload). This result indicates that G143R mutant has a higher binding affinity with Ca2+–CaM. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments were performed to obtain the binding affinity and stoichiometry of the interaction between Cx46 IL domain and CaM (Fig. 5). We isolated His-tagged CaM and WT and mutant IL domains and determined their purity by SDS-PAGE (Fig. S2). The binding event is exothermic as predicted according to the interaction between Cx44 and CaM (16Zhou Y. Yang W. Lurtz M.M. Chen Y. Jiang J. Huang Y. Louis C.F. Yang J.J. Calmodulin mediates the Ca2+-dependent regulation of Cx44 gap junction.Biophys.

In the presence of 2 mm Ca2+, the dissociation constant of WT is 2.95 ± 1.5 μm, whereas Kd of the G143R mutant is 1.58 ± 0.7 μm (Fig. 5A). Moreover, both WT and G143R mutant bound to Ca2+–CaM at ˜1:1 ratio at pH 6.8, the physiological condition in the lens. The binding affinity for CaM is almost 2-fold higher in the mutant compared with WT. A similar difference in binding affinity between CaM and the IL domain of WT (2.5 μm) and mutant (1.17 μm) was observed with 0.3 mm Ca2+ (Fig. 5B). To determine whether this interaction occurs with active CaM, we conducted ITC in the absence of Ca2+ (EGTA-buffered solution). The interaction between WT IL domain and CaM did not happen without Ca2+, whereas the interaction with CaM was still detectable with G143R mutant (Fig. 5C). Confocal microscopy with immunolabeling of Cx46 and G143R showed a similar level of co-localization with CaM under normal extracellular Ca2+ conditions, and this co-localization was reduced in wildtype, but not in the mutant, under Ca2+-depleted conditions (Fig. 6A). Because of the endogenous expression of CaM, we quantified the extent of co-localization by detecting the overlapping signals of Cx46 over CaM (Fig. 6A, right panels). Because antibody against extracellular domains of Cx46 is not available, fluorescent signals were generated from Cx46 on the plasma membrane as well as inside the cell. To validate the co-location results on plasma membrane, we used total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microcopy that allows detection of proteins predominantly on plasma membrane (Fig. 6B). By quantification, a similar increased level of co-localization of MT was detected (Fig. 6B, right panel). For clear visualization, we presented individual staining with gray scale and merged in colors. Together, these data suggest that G143R mutation promotes the interaction between Cx46 and CaM, and this interaction even occurs without the activation of CaM by Ca2+. We used a CaM inhibitor, calmidazolium chloride, to determine the role of CaM in Cx46 hemichannel activity. The rate of Etd dye uptake was greater in G143R mutant than in WT control. The dye uptake rate was greatly reduced in the presence of CaM inhibitor (Fig. 7A, upper panel, Inh). Ionomycin permits influx of Ca2+ through plasma membrane to raise intracellular level of Ca2+. Application of ionomycin led to a dramatic increase in hemichannel uptake observed in both WT and G143R mutant as compared with non-treated controls (Fig. 7A, lower left panel). Moreover, this increased dye uptake by ionomycin was greatly reduced by the CaM inhibitor (Fig. 7A, lower right panel, Inh), suggesting that the increase in hemichannel activity was mediated by the activation of CaM via elevated intracellular Ca2+. The rate of hemichannel dye uptake was quantified (Fig. 7B). A similar result was obtained with another hemichannel-permeable tracer, biocytin (Fig. 7C). In addition, HeLa cells alone (C) had minimal uptake. These results suggest that activated CaM is essential for the permeability of Cx46 hemichannels. As shown in Fig. 1B, under resting membrane potential, WT and G143R Cx46 form leaky channels associated with the depolarization of plasma membrane. We examined the permeability of hemichannels under various membrane potentials by using Locke's saline buffer (resting potential) and varying extracellular Na+ and K+ concentrations (changing membrane potential) (Fig. 8 and Fig. S3). Increased permeability was observed for both WT and the mutant with 154 mm Na+, a hyperpolarization condition. Additionally, hemichannel activity is even greater in G143R mutant than in WT (Fig. 8A and Fig. S3A). Replacing Na+ with K+ to depolarize cells did not enhance and even reduced permeability from that of resting potential. Depletion of extracellular Ca2+ is known to activate connexin hemichannels. However, the decreased activity of hemichannels under depolarizing conditions was also observed in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, although the overall hemichannel activity is higher without extracellular Ca2+. As shown in Fig. 7, Ca2+ influx at resting potential drastically increased hemichannel activity. Interestingly, this increase in hemichannel activity was not observed under depolarization conditions (Fig. 8B and Fig. S3B). To alleviate the possible influence of using positively charged molecule (Etd) on dye uptake, we conducted similar studies using biocytin, a neutral molecule. Similar to the observation with Etd (Fig. 8A), high extracellular Na+ increased biocytin uptake in both WT and mutant, whereas high extracellular K+ reduced biocytin uptake relative to levels at resting membrane potential (Fig. 8C). This result indicates that charges on tracer dye molecules are unlikely to be involved and supports a specific effect of membrane potential on hemichannel uptake. Together, the data suggest that membrane potential plays a critical role in Cx46 hemichannel activity; depolarization of membrane potential inactivates hemichannels. Under physiological membrane potential Ca2+–CaM, possibly through the interaction with intracellular loop of Cx46, increases hemichannel activation. In contrast, the G143R mutation dysregulates and enhances the interaction with CaM, resulting in aberrant Ca2+ sensitivity and increased activity of hemichannels. G143R is the only mutation identified in the IL domain region of Cx46 linking to congenital cataracts. Our earlier study showed that this mutation impairs gap junction channels while enhancing hemichannel activity as indicated by the dye uptake assay (10Ren Q. Riquelme M.A. Xu J. Yan X. Nicholson B.J. Gu S. Jiang J.X. Cataract-causing mutation of human connexin 46 impairs gap junction, but increases hemichannel function and cell death.PLoS One. 2013; 8 (24019978)e74732 10.1371/journal.pone.0074732Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This study aims to elucidate the underlying mechanism concerning how this mutation causes dysfunction of connexin hemichannels in the lens. Gly143 is a highly conserved amino acid residue across various types of connexins and animal species. Our CD study shows that the IL domain of Cx46 has considerable α-helical content that is sensitive to pH and Ca2+. G143R, in which the small hydrophobic side chain of glycine is replaced with the large, positive charged one of asparagine, results in a great reduction in α-helical structural content of the IL domain. Moreover, this mutation renders the IL domain less sensitive to Ca2+ and pH. Inside human lens fiber cells, pH is relatively low (pH ˜ 6.6) and Ca2+ is high (0.5–1 mm) (17Vanmarle J. Jonges R. Vrensen G.F. Dewolf A. Calcium and its localization in human lens fibres: an electron tomographic study.Exp. Eye Res. 1997; 65 (9237868): 83-8810.1006/exer.1997.0313Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). This lack of adaptability by the mutation to in situ physiological environment might partially be responsible for malfunction of channel activities. Elevation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration was long thought to be related to the reduction of permeability in gap junction channels (18Rose B. Simpson I. Loewenstein W.R. Calcium ion produces graded changes in permeability of membrane channels in cell junction.Nature. 1977; 267 (406571): 625-62710.1038/267625a0Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). CaM was recognized to play a critical role in regulating gap junction channels by uncoupling gap junction channels and inhibiting gap junction permeability (19Peracchia C. Bernardini G. Peracchia L.L. Is calmodulin involved in the regulation of gap junction permeability?.Pflugers Arch. 1983; 399 (6316253): 152-15410.1007/BF00663912Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Although extracellular Ca2+ inhibits hemichannel opening, intracellular Ca2+ is reported to positively regulate Cx43 and Cx32 hemichannel activity (20Figueroa V. Sáez P.J. Salas J.D. Salas D. Jara O.

Additionally, increased intracellular Ca2+ enhances the electrical conductance of Cx46 hemichannels, contrary to the reduced gap junction channels (20Figueroa V. Sáez P.J. Salas J.D. Salas D. Jara O.

Concurring with our finding, another paper reports that residue Gly45 in Cx26 is a Ca2+ sensor, and mutation of this residue to Glu in the keratitis–ichthyosis–deafness syndrome leads to “leaky” hemichannels and cell death (23Zhang Y. Hao H. Conserved glycine at position 45 of major cochlear connexins constitutes a vital component of the Ca2+ sensor for gating of gap junction hemichannels.Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Residue Gly143 is located in the Ca2+–CaM–binding motif, and this mutation is likely to affect the interaction between Cx46 and CaM. A previous study reports that CaM mediates the Ca2+-dependent regulation of Cx44, the sheep ortholog of human Cx46 (16Zhou Y. Yang W. Lurtz M.M. Chen Y. Jiang J. Huang Y. Louis C.F. Yang J.J.

Another study suggests that unlike other gap junction channels, gating of Cx46 hemichannels is not directly regulated by Ca2+ but is likely mediated by CaM (24Peracchia C.

We showed the direct interaction between the Cx46 IL domain and CaM using both protein pulldown and ITC. Furthermore, the interaction between Cx46 IL domain and CaM occurs in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Interestingly, this interaction is enhanced by the Gly143 mutation at both low and high concentrations of CaM. Protein pulldown assay showed that, in contrast to WT IL domain with minimal association with CaM, the G143R mutant strongly associated with CaM. We also confirmed the increased interaction between CaM and full-length Cx46G143R protein using co-immunoprecipitation assay.

However, the definition of the elderly is different in each report. If the elderly are defined as people aged 85 years or older, data on the effectiveness and safety of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for CBD stones are limited. This study investigated the efficacy and safety of endoscopic procedures for CBD stones in patients aged 85 years or older. 1,016 consecutive ERCP procedures were performed at our institution from January 2009 to December 2014. Of these, 235 cases with CBD stones were finally analyzed. Group A patients were younger than 85 years and Group B patients were 85 years or older. Patient background, details of endoscopic therapy, complications, and related factors were retrospectively reviewed for 185 cases in Group A, and 50 cases in Group B. Patients in Group B showed high rates of dementia and cerebrovascular disorders and larger CBD stones and diameters, in comparison with patients in Group A. The complete removal rate of bile duct stones was slightly higher in Group A. However, there was no difference between the two groups in recurrence rate of CBD stones, complication and mortality rates, and length and cost of hospitalization. Despite some differences between the two groups, endoscopic procedures for CBD stones in patients aged 85 years or older can be performed effectively and safely without increasing medical costs."
https://openalex.org/W2782096013,"Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is one of the key redox-sensitive proteins whose activity is largely affected by oxidative modifications at its highly reactive cysteine residue in the enzyme's active site (Cys149). Prolonged exposure to oxidative stress may cause, inter alia, the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds leading to accumulation of GAPDH aggregates and ultimately to cell death. Recently these anomalies have been linked with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Novel evidences indicate that low molecular compounds may be effective inhibitors potentially preventing the GAPDH translocation to the nucleus, and inhibiting or slowing down its aggregation and oligomerization. Therefore, we decided to establish the ability of naturally occurring compound, piceatannol, to interact with GAPDH and to reveal its effect on functional properties and selected parameters of the dehydrogenase structure. The obtained data revealed that piceatannol binds to GAPDH. The ITC analysis indicated that one molecule of the tetrameric enzyme may bind up to 8 molecules of polyphenol (7.3 ± 0.9). Potential binding sites of piceatannol to the GAPDH molecule were analyzed using the Ligand Fit algorithm. Conducted analysis detected 11 ligand binding positions. We indicated that piceatannol decreases GAPDH activity. Detailed analysis allowed us to presume that this effect is due to piceatannol ability to assemble a covalent binding with nucleophilic cysteine residue (Cys149) which is directly involved in the catalytic reaction. Consequently, our studies strongly indicate that piceatannol would be an exceptional inhibitor thanks to its ability to break the aforementioned pathologic disulfide linkage, and therefore to inhibit GAPDH aggregation. We demonstrated that by binding with GAPDH piceatannol blocks cysteine residue and counteracts its oxidative modifications, that induce oligomerization and GAPDH aggregation."

On this basis, therapeutic drugs targeting BCL-2 and MCL-1 might have enhanced activity if used in combination. We identified anti-leukaemic drugs sensitising to BCL-2 antagonism and drugs sensitising to MCL-1 antagonism using the technique of dynamic BH3 profiling, whereby cells were primed with drugs to discover whether this would elicit mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilisation in response to BCL-2-targeting BAD-BH3 peptide or MCL-1-targeting MS1-BH3 peptide. We found that a broad range of anti-leukaemic agents-notably MCL-1 inhibitors, DNA damaging agents and FLT3 inhibitors-sensitise leukaemia cells to BAD-BH3. We further analysed the BCL-2 inhibitors ABT-199 and JQ1, the MCL-1 inhibitors pladienolide B and torin1, the FLT3 inhibitor AC220 and the DNA double-strand break inducer etoposide to correlate priming responses with co-operative induction of apoptosis. ABT-199 in combination with pladienolide B, torin1, etoposide or AC220 strongly induced apoptosis within 4 hours, but the MCL-1 inhibitors did not co-operate with etoposide or AC220. In keeping with the long half-life of BCL-2, the BET domain inhibitor JQ1 was found to downregulate BCL-2 and to prime cells to respond to MS1-BH3 at 48, but not at 4 hours: prolonged priming with JQ1 was then shown to induce rapid cytochrome C release when pladienolide B, torin1, etoposide or AC220 were added. In conclusion, dynamic BH3 profiling is a useful mechanism-based tool for understanding and predicting co-operative lethality between drugs sensitising to BCL-2 antagonism and drugs sensitising to MCL-1 antagonism. A plethora of agents sensitised cells to BAD-BH3-mediated mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilisation in the dynamic BH3 profiling assay and this was associated with effective co-operation with the BCL-2 inhibitory compounds ABT-199 or JQ1."
https://openalex.org/W2781885717,"Characterizing and naming species becomes more and more challenging due to the increasing difficulty of accurately delineating specific bounderies. In this context, integrative taxonomy aims to delimit taxonomic units by leveraging the complementarity of multiple data sources (geography, morphology, genetics, etc.). However, while the theoretical framework of integrative taxonomy has been explicitly stated, methods for the simultaneous analysis of multiple data sets are poorly developed and in many cases different information sources are still explored successively. Multi-table methods developed in the field of community ecology provide such an intregrative framework. In particular, multiple co-inertia analysis is flexible enough to allow the integration of morphological, distributional, and genetic data in the same analysis. We have applied this powerfull approach to delimit species boundaries in a group of poorly differentiated catfishes belonging to the genus Guyanancistrus from the Guianas region of northeastern South America. Because the species G. brevispinis has been claimed to be a species complex consisting of five species, particular attention was paid to taxon. Separate analyses indicated the presence of eight distinct species of Guyanancistrus, including five new species and one new genus. However, none of the preliminary analyses revealed different lineages within G. brevispinis, and the multi-table analysis revealed three intraspecific lineages. After taxonomic clarifications and description of the new genus, species and subspecies, a reappraisal of the biogeography of Guyanancistrus members was performed. This analysis revealed three distinct dispersals from the Upper reaches of Amazonian tributaries toward coastal rivers of the Eastern Guianas Ecoregion. The central role played by the Maroni River, as gateway from the Amazon basin, was confirmed. The Maroni River was also found to be a center of speciation for Guyanancistrus (with three species and two subspecies), as well as a source of dispersal of G. brevispinis toward the other main basins of the Eastern Guianas."

The therapeutic options for this type of cancer are limited; therefore, the development of novel therapeutic agents is urgently required. Sialic acid-binding lectin isolated from Rana catesbeiana oocytes (cSBL) is a novel therapeutic candidate for cancer, which exhibits antitumor activity mediated through RNA degradation. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of cSBL in vitro and in vivo. Xenograft-competent H2452 and MSTO human mesothelioma cell lines were treated with cSBL, and the pathway by which cSBL induces apoptosis was analyzed. In vivo studies were performed using nude mice inoculated with one of the two cell lines, and the effects of cSBL and pemetrexed were monitored simultaneously. Furthermore, the pharmacological interactions between the three agents (pemetrexed, cisplatin and cSBL) were statistically assessed. It was demonstrated that cSBL treatments caused morphological and biochemical apoptotic changes in both cell lines. Caspase cascade analysis revealed that an intrinsic pathway mediated cSBL-induced apoptosis. The administration of cSBL significantly inhibited tumor growth in two xenograft models, without any adverse effects. Furthermore, the combination index and dose reduction index values indicated that the cSBL + pemetrexed combination showed the highest synergism, and thus potential for reducing dosage of each drug, compared with the other combinations, including the existing pemetrexed + cisplatin regimen. cSBL exerted prominent antitumor effects on malignant mesothelioma cells in vitro and in vivo, and showed favorable effects when combined with pemetrexed. These results suggest that cSBL has potential as a novel drug for the treatment of malignant mesothelioma."

The expression of the cytochrome P450 1A (cyp1a) gene is upregulated in the presence of TCDD through activating the aryl hydrocarbon receptor pathway in a dose-dependent manner. Several essential response elements, including the 8 potential xenobiotic response elements in the cyp1a promoter region, have been identified to be the main functional parts for the response to TCDD. Thus, we aimed to develop a convenient and sensitive biomonitoring tool to examine the level of POPs in the environment and evaluate its potential human health risks by TCDD. Here, we established a transgenic zebrafish model with a red fluorescent reporter gene ( mCherry) using the truncated cyp1a promoter. Under exposure to TCDD, the expression pattern of mCherry in the reporter zebrafish mirrored that of endogenous cyp1a mRNA, and the primary target tissues for TCDD were the brain vessels, liver, gut, cloaca, and skin. Our results indicated that exposure of the embryos to TCDD at concentrations as low as 0.005 nM for 48 h, which did not elicit morphologic abnormalities in the embryos, markedly increased mCherry expression. In addition, the reporter embryos responded to other POPs, and primary liver cell culture of zebrafish revealed that Cyp1a protein was mainly expressed in the cytoplasm of liver cells. Furthermore, our transgenic fish embryos demonstrated that TCDD exposure can regulate the expression levels of several tumor-related factors, including epidermal growth factor, TNF-α, C-myc, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, TGF-β, serine/threonine kinase (Akt), and phosphorylated Akt, suggesting that our transgenic fish can be used as a sensitive model to evaluate the carcinogenicity induced by TCDD exposure.-Luo, J.-J., Su, D.-S., Xie, S.-L., Liu, Y., Liu, P., Yang, X.-J., Pei D.-S.

Early insertional mutagenesis studies in mice first identified this isoform, and demonstrated that it was crucial for mouse brain development. RFX4 isoform 1 is the only RFX4 isoform significantly expressed in the mouse fetal and adult brain. In this study, we evaluated conditional knock-out (KO) mice in which one or two floxed alleles of Rfx4 were deleted early in development through the use of a Sox2-Cre transgene. Heterozygous deletion of Rfx4 resulted in severe, non-communicating congenital hydrocephalus associated with hypoplasia of the subcommissural organ. Homozygous deletion of Rfx4 resulted in formation of a single ventricle in the forebrain, and severe dorsoventral patterning defects in the telencephalon and midbrain at embryonic day 12.5, a collection of phenotypes that resembled human holoprosencephaly. No anatomical abnormalities were noted outside the brain in either case. At the molecular level, transcripts encoded by the cilia-related gene Foxj1 were significantly decreased, and Foxj1 was identified as a direct gene target of RFX4 isoform 1. The phenotypes were similar to those observed in the previous Rfx4 insertional mutagenesis studies. Thus, we provide a novel conditional KO animal model in which to investigate the downstream genes directly and/or indirectly regulated by RFX4 isoform 1.

Five subterranean nests were excavated; one of them filled with liquid cement for extraction of casts of chambers, shafts and tunnels. All nests were found in a woodland area, with Dystrophic Red Latosol soil, associated with roots of large trees and, differently from the pattern currently described for this subfamily, presented a complex structure with multiple entrances and more than one vertical shaft connected by tunnels to relatively horizontal chambers. The number of chambers varied from 24 to 77, with mean volume ranging from 200.09 cm3 to 363.79 cm3, and maximum depth of 134 cm. Worker population varied between 304 and 864 individuals with on average 8.28 cm2 of area per worker. All nests had at least one Hall, which is a relatively larger chamber serving as a distribution centre of the nest, and to our knowledge, there is no record of Ponerinae species building similar structure. All nests had chambers ""paved"" with pieces of decaying plant material and on the floor of some of them, we found a fungus whose identification and function are being investigated. Thus, our findings provide evidence to suggest that nests of O. chelifer can be considered complex, due to the great number and organization of chambers, shafts and connections, compared to those currently described for Ponerinae species."

We also heated the fragments to determine the heat tolerance of the functional fragments. HpaXm35-51 and Hpa1Xoo36-52 induced hypersensitive response (HR). Bursts of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) induced by HpaXm35-51 and Hpa1Xoo36-52 were earlier and stronger than those induced by HpaXm and Hpa1Xoo. In plants treated with HpaXm35-51 or Hpa1Xoo36-52, the expression of the HR marker genes Hin1 and Hsr203J and the active oxygen metabolism related gene AOX were significantly upregulated.

PGP result by soaking seeds in unheated/heated HpaXm10-39 or Hpa1Xoo10-40 solution prior to transfer, which obviously enhances root growth and the aerial parts of plants.

In addition, HR marker genes induced by the heated fragments had lower expression levels than when induced with unheated HpaXm fragments. Moreover, the expression levels of HR marker genes and PGP related genes induced by treatment with Hpa1Xoo fragments before or after heating were the opposite of those induced by HpaXm fragments.

However, the build-up of thrombosis in vena cava filters after deployment presents a severe problem to patients. Previous studies proposed that filters with helical flow are beneficial and capable of alleviating this problem. In this study, the hemodynamic performances of four typical helical flow inducers in the vena cava are determined using computational fluid dynamics simulations (steady-state and pulsatile flow) and compared. Pilot in vitro experiments were also conducted. The simulation results demonstrate that large-diameter inducers produce helical flow. Among inducers with identical diameter, those with a smaller thread pitch are more likely to induce increased helical flow. We also observed that the small thread pitch inducers can yield higher shear rates. Furthermore, a large diameter, small thread pitch helical flow inducer increases the time-averaged wall shear stress and reduces the oscillating shear index and relative residence time on the vessel wall in the vicinity of the helical flow inducer. In vitro experiments also verify that large diameter inducers generate a helical flow. A notable observation of this study is that the diameter is the key parameter that affects the induction of a helical flow. This study will likely provide important guidance for the design of interventional treatments and the deployment of filters associated with helical flow in the vena cava."

In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, lack of function of protection of telomere 1 (Pot1) or telomerase catalytic subunit (Trt1) results in survivors with circular chromosomes. Hitherto, it is poorly understood how cells with circular chromosomes survive and how circular chromosomes are maintained. Fission yeast Cut17/Bir1, Ark1, Pic1, and Nbl1 is a conserved chromosome passenger complex (CPC) functioning mainly throughout mitosis. Here, using a temperature-sensitive mutant of CPC subunits, we determined that CPC is synthetically lethal in combination with either Pot1 or Trt1. The pot1Δ pic1-T269 double mutant, which has circular chromosomes, showed a high percentage of chromosome mis-segregation and DNA damage foci at 33°C. We furthermore found that neither Shugoshin Sgo2 nor heterochromatin protein Swi6, which contribute to the centromeric localization of CPC, were required for the survival in the absence of Pot1. Both the pot1Δ sgo2Δ and pot1Δ swi6Δ double mutants displayed a high percentage of DNA damage foci, but a low percentage of chromosome mis-segregation, suggesting the link between the high percentage of chromosome mis-segregation and the lethality of the CPC pot1Δ double mutant. Our results suggest that CPC is required for the survival of cells with circular chromosomes and sheds light on the possible roles of CPC in the maintenance of circular chromosomes."

Single segment substitution lines (SSSLs) have become the preferred experimental materials in mapping functional genetic variations as the particular chromosome segments from donor genotypes can be evaluated for their impact on the phenotype in a recurrent recipient background. The phenotypic differences can be attributed to the control of quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Here, we evaluated a library consisting of 1,123 SSSLs in the same genetic background of an elite rice variety, Huajingxian74 (HJX74), and revealed four SSSLs, W05-1-11-2-7-6 (W05), W08-16-3-2 (W08), W12-28-58-03-19-1 (W12), and W22-9-5-2-4-9-3 (W22), which had a significantly different heading date compared to HJX74. To further genetically dissect the QTLs controlling heading date on chromosomes 3, 6, and 10, four SSSLs were used to develop 15 secondary SSSLs with the smaller substituted segments. The qHD-3 heading date QTL detected in W05 and W08 was delimited to an interval of 4.15 cM, whereas qHD-6-1 and qHD-6-2 heading date QTLs dissected from the substituted segments in W12 were mapped to the intervals of 2.25-cM and 2.55-cM, respectively. The qHD-10 QTL detected on the substituted segment in W22 was mapped to an interval of 6.85-cM. The nucleotide and amino acid sequence changes for those genes in the secondary SSSLs were also revealed. The allele variations of those genes might contribute to the heading date QTLs on chromosome 3 (DTH3, OsDof12, and EHD4), chromosome 6 (Hd3a, Hd17, and RFT1), and chromosome 10 (Ehd1 and Ehd2). These sequence variations in heading date genes would be useful resources for further studying the function of genes, and would be important for rice breeding. Overall, our results indicate that secondary SSSLs were powerful tools for genetic dissection of QTLs and identification of differentiation in the genes."

Despite such extreme environments, some indigenous species have thrived there. Alvinellid worms (Annelida) are among the organisms best adapted to high-temperature and oxidatively stressful venting regions. Although intensive studies of the adaptation of these worms to the environments of hydrothermal vents have been made, little is known about the worms' sensory adaptation to the severe chemical conditions there. To examine the sensitivity of the vent-endemic worm Paralvinella hessleri to low pH and oxidative stress, we determined the concentration of acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide that induced avoidance behavior of this worm, and compared these concentrations to those obtained for related species inhabiting intertidal zones, Thelepus sp. The concentrations of the chemicals that induced avoidance behavior of P. hessleri were 10-100 times lower than those for Thelepus sp. To identify the receptors for these chemicals, chemical avoidance tests were performed with the addition of ruthenium red, a blocker of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. This treatment suppressed the chemical avoidance behavior of P. hessleri, which suggests that TRP channels are involved in the chemical avoidance behavior of this species. Our results revealed for the first time hypersensitive detection systems for acid and for oxidative stress in the vent-endemic worm P. hessleri, possibly mediated by TRP channels, suggesting that such sensory systems may have facilitated the adaptation of this organism to harsh vent environments."

Routes to learning such coordinated actions include imitation and participation in joint action. However, little is known about the mechanisms guiding transmission of coordinated actions through observation and joint action performance. This paper reports an experiment comparing children's tendency to imitate multiple, coordinated actions following demonstration by a single model acting bimanually (Bimanual Observation condition), two models performing the same actions jointly with one performing each hand action (Joint Observation condition) and a condition in which the child actively takes part in the joint action demonstration by performing one part in coordination with a partner (Joint Action condition). When children were subsequently left alone to perform the task independently, they were more likely to imitate both coordinated actions in the two observation conditions than in the Joint Action condition, with no difference between performance in Bimanual and Joint Observation conditions. It is argued that this is due to children being more able to form a global representation of both actions and the relations between the two when observing from a distance than when actively involved in the task."
https://openalex.org/W2781557251,"Understanding the effect of cis-regulatory elements (CRE) and clusters of CREs, which are called cis-regulatory modules (CRM), in eukaryotic gene expression is a challenge of computational biology. We developed two programs that allow simple, fast and reliable analysis of candidate CREs and CRMs that may affect specific gene expression and that determine positional features between individual CREs within a CRM. The first program, ""Exploration of Distinctive CREs and CRMs"" (EDCC), correlates candidate CREs and CRMs with specific gene expression patterns. For pairs of CREs, EDCC also determines positional preferences of the single CREs in relation to each other and to the transcriptional start site. The second program, ""CRM Network Generator"" (CNG), prioritizes these positional preferences using a neural network and thus allows unbiased rating of the positional preferences that were determined by EDCC. We tested these programs with data from a microarray study of circadian gene expression in Arabidopsis thaliana. Analyzing more than 1.5 million pairwise CRE combinations, we found 22 candidate combinations, of which several contained known clock promoter elements together with elements that had not been identified as relevant to circadian gene expression before. CNG analysis further identified positional preferences of these CRE pairs, hinting at positional information that may be relevant for circadian gene expression. Future wet lab experiments will have to determine which of these combinations confer daytime specific circadian gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2781575715,"Understanding correlation between influential factors and insurance losses is beneficial for insurers to accurately price and modify the bonus-malus system. Although there have been a certain number of achievements in insurance losses and claims modeling, limited efforts focus on exploring the relative role of accidents characteristics in insurance losses. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the influential priority of transit accidents attributes, such as the time, location and type of accidents. Based on the dataset from Washington State Transit Insurance Pool (WSTIP) in USA, we implement several key algorithms to achieve the objectives. First, K-means algorithm contributes to cluster the insurance loss data into 6 intervals; second, Grey Relational Analysis (GCA) model is applied to calculate grey relational grades of the influential factors in each interval; in addition, we implement Naive Bayes model to compute the posterior probability of factors values falling in each interval. The results show that the time, location and type of accidents significantly influence the insurance loss in the first five intervals, but their grey relational grades show no significantly difference. In the last interval which represents the highest insurance loss, the grey relational grade of the time is significant higher than that of the location and type of accidents. For each value of the time and location, the insurance loss most likely falls in the first and second intervals which refers to the lower loss. However, for accidents between buses and non-motorized road users, the probability of insurance loss falling in the interval 6 tends to be highest."
