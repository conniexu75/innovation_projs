https://openalex.org/W3112563877,"Measurement of the location of molecules in tissues is essential for understanding tissue formation and function. Previously, we developed Slide-seq, a technology that enables transcriptome-wide detection of RNAs with a spatial resolution of 10 μm. Here we report Slide-seqV2, which combines improvements in library generation, bead synthesis and array indexing to reach an RNA capture efficiency ~50% that of single-cell RNA-seq data (~10-fold greater than Slide-seq), approaching the detection efficiency of droplet-based single-cell RNA-seq techniques. First, we leverage the detection efficiency of Slide-seqV2 to identify dendritically localized mRNAs in neurons of the mouse hippocampus. Second, we integrate the spatial information of Slide-seqV2 data with single-cell trajectory analysis tools to characterize the spatiotemporal development of the mouse neocortex, identifying underlying genetic programs that were poorly sampled with Slide-seq. The combination of near-cellular resolution and high transcript detection efficiency makes Slide-seqV2 useful across many experimental contexts."
https://openalex.org/W3111038302,"Seasonal influenza viruses constantly change through antigenic drift and the emergence of pandemic influenza viruses through antigenic shift is unpredictable. Conventional influenza virus vaccines induce strain-specific neutralizing antibodies against the variable immunodominant globular head domain of the viral hemagglutinin protein. This necessitates frequent re-formulation of vaccines and handicaps pandemic preparedness. In this completed, observer-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase I trial (NCT03300050), safety and immunogenicity of chimeric hemagglutinin-based vaccines were tested in healthy, 18–39-year-old US adults. The study aimed to test the safety and ability of the vaccines to elicit broadly cross-reactive antibodies against the hemagglutinin stalk domain. Participants were enrolled into five groups to receive vaccinations with live-attenuated followed by AS03-adjuvanted inactivated vaccine (n = 20), live-attenuated followed by inactivated vaccine (n = 15), twice AS03-adjuvanted inactivated vaccine (n = 16) or placebo (n = 5, intranasal followed by intramuscular; n = 10, twice intramuscular) 3 months apart. Vaccination was found to be safe and induced a broad, strong, durable and functional immune response targeting the conserved, immunosubdominant stalk of the hemagglutinin. The results suggest that chimeric hemagglutinins have the potential to be developed as universal vaccines that protect broadly against influenza viruses."
https://openalex.org/W3111272930,"Autonomous regulation of the intestine requires the combined activity of functionally distinct neurons of the enteric nervous system (ENS). However, the variety of enteric neuron types and how they emerge during development remain largely unknown. Here, we define a molecular taxonomy of 12 enteric neuron classes within the myenteric plexus of the mouse small intestine using single-cell RNA sequencing. We present cell-cell communication features and histochemical markers for motor neurons, sensory neurons and interneurons, together with transgenic tools for class-specific targeting. Transcriptome analysis of the embryonic ENS uncovers a novel principle of neuronal diversification, where two neuron classes arise through a binary neurogenic branching and all other identities emerge through subsequent postmitotic differentiation. We identify generic and class-specific transcriptional regulators and functionally connect Pbx3 to a postmitotic fate transition. Our results offer a conceptual and molecular resource for dissecting ENS circuits and predicting key regulators for directed differentiation of distinct enteric neuron classes."
https://openalex.org/W3113006061,"Human genomes are typically assembled as consensus sequences that lack information on parental haplotypes. Here we describe a reference-free workflow for diploid de novo genome assembly that combines the chromosome-wide phasing and scaffolding capabilities of single-cell strand sequencing1,2 with continuous long-read or high-fidelity3 sequencing data. Employing this strategy, we produced a completely phased de novo genome assembly for each haplotype of an individual of Puerto Rican descent (HG00733) in the absence of parental data. The assemblies are accurate (quality value > 40) and highly contiguous (contig N50 > 23 Mbp) with low switch error rates (0.17%), providing fully phased single-nucleotide variants, indels and structural variants. A comparison of Oxford Nanopore Technologies and Pacific Biosciences phased assemblies identified 154 regions that are preferential sites of contig breaks, irrespective of sequencing technology or phasing algorithms."
https://openalex.org/W3112640289,"Abstract Haplotype-resolved or phased genome assembly provides a complete picture of genomes and their complex genetic variations. However, current algorithms for phased assembly either do not generate chromosome-scale phasing or require pedigree information, which limits their application. We present a method named diploid assembly (DipAsm) that uses long, accurate reads and long-range conformation data for single individuals to generate a chromosome-scale phased assembly within 1 day. Applied to four public human genomes, PGP1, HG002, NA12878 and HG00733, DipAsm produced haplotype-resolved assemblies with minimum contig length needed to cover 50% of the known genome (NG50) up to 25 Mb and phased ~99.5% of heterozygous sites at 98–99% accuracy, outperforming other approaches in terms of both contiguity and phasing completeness. We demonstrate the importance of chromosome-scale phased assemblies for the discovery of structural variants (SVs), including thousands of new transposon insertions, and of highly polymorphic and medically important regions such as the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) regions. DipAsm will facilitate high-quality precision medicine and studies of individual haplotype variation and population diversity."

https://openalex.org/W3112931590,"Cortical neurons process information on multiple timescales, and areas important for working memory (WM) contain neurons capable of integrating information over a long timescale. However, the underlying mechanisms for the emergence of neuronal timescales stable enough to support WM are unclear. By analyzing a spiking recurrent neural network model trained on a WM task and activity of single neurons in the primate prefrontal cortex, we show that the temporal properties of our model and the neural data are remarkably similar. Dissecting our recurrent neural network model revealed strong inhibitory-to-inhibitory connections underlying a disinhibitory microcircuit as a critical component for long neuronal timescales and WM maintenance. We also found that enhancing inhibitory-to-inhibitory connections led to more stable temporal dynamics and improved task performance. Finally, we show that a network with such microcircuitry can perform other tasks without disrupting its pre-existing timescale architecture, suggesting that strong inhibitory signaling underlies a flexible WM network. By analyzing computational models and neural data from the primate prefrontal cortex, the authors show that inhibitory-to-inhibitory signaling is critical for the stable temporal dynamics required for performing working memory tasks."

https://openalex.org/W3113354915,"The human face is complex and multipartite, and characterization of its genetic architecture remains challenging. Using a multivariate genome-wide association study meta-analysis of 8,246 European individuals, we identified 203 genome-wide-significant signals (120 also study-wide significant) associated with normal-range facial variation. Follow-up analyses indicate that the regions surrounding these signals are enriched for enhancer activity in cranial neural crest cells and craniofacial tissues, several regions harbor multiple signals with associations to different facial phenotypes, and there is evidence for potential coordinated actions of variants. In summary, our analyses provide insights into the understanding of how complex morphological traits are shaped by both individual and coordinated genetic actions."

https://openalex.org/W3111200180,"Pancreatic cancer (PC) is difficult to defeat due to mechanism (s) driving metastasis and drug resistance. Cancer stemness is a major challenging phenomenon associated with PC metastasis and limiting therapy efficacy. In this study, we evaluated the pre-clinical and clinical significance of eradicating pancreatic cancer stem cells (PCSC) and its components using a pan-EGFR inhibitor afatinib in combination with gemcitabine. Afatinib in combination with gemcitabine significantly reduced KrasG12D/+; Pdx-1 Cre (KC) (P < 0.01) and KrasG12D/+; p53R172H/+; Pdx-1 Cre (KPC) (P < 0.05) derived mouse tumoroids and KPC-derived murine syngeneic cell line growth compared to gemcitabine/afatinib alone treatment. The drug combination also reduced PC xenograft tumor burden (P < 0.05) and the incidence of metastasis by affecting key stemness markers, as confirmed by co-localization studies. Moreover, the drug combination significantly decreases the growth of various PC patient-derived organoids (P < 0.001). We found that SOX9 is significantly overexpressed in high-grade PC tumors (P < 0.05) and in chemotherapy-treated patients compared to chemo-naïve patients (P < 0.05). These results were further validated using publicly available datasets. Moreover, afatinib alone or in combination with gemcitabine decreased stemness and tumorspheres by reducing phosphorylation of EGFR family proteins, ERK, FAK, and CSC markers. Mechanistically, afatinib treatment decreased CSC markers by downregulating SOX9 via FOXA2. Indeed, EGFR and FOXA2 depletion reduced SOX9 expression in PCSCs. Taken together, pan-EGFR inhibition by afatinib impedes PCSCs growth and metastasis via the EGFR/ERK/FOXA2/SOX9 axis. This novel mechanism of pan-EGFR inhibitor and its ability to eradicate CSC may serve as a tailor-made approach to enhance chemotherapeutic benefits in other cancer types."
https://openalex.org/W3113325921,"Abstract Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide underlining the urgent need for new biomarkers and therapeutic targets for this disease. Long noncoding RNAs are critical players in NSCLC but the role of small RNA species is not well understood. In the present study, we investigated the role of H/ACA box small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) and snoRNA-bound ribonucleoproteins (snoRNPs) in the tumorigenesis of NSCLC. H/ACA box snoRNPs including the NOP10 core protein were highly expressed in NSCLC. High levels of either NOP10 mRNA or protein were associated with poor prognosis in NSCLC patients. Loss of NOP10 and subsequent reduction of H/ACA box snoRNAs and rRNA pseudouridylation inhibited lung cancer cell growth, colony formation, migration, and invasion. A focused CRISPR/Cas9 snoRNA knockout screen revealed that genomic deletion of SNORA65, SNORA7A, and SNORA7B reduced proliferation of lung cancer cells. In line, high levels of SNORA65, SNORA7A, and SNORA7B were observed in primary lung cancer specimens with associated changes in rRNA pseudouridylation. Knockdown of either SNORA65 or SNORA7A/B inhibited growth and colony formation of NSCLC cell lines. Our data indicate that specific H/ACA box snoRNAs and snoRNA-associated proteins such as NOP10 have an oncogenic role in NSCLC providing new potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for the disease."
https://openalex.org/W3111133807,"Virtually all aspects of cell biology are regulated by a ubiquitin code where distinct ubiquitin chain architectures guide the binding events and itineraries of modified substrates. Various combinations of E2 and E3 enzymes accomplish chain formation by forging isopeptide bonds between the C terminus of their transiently linked donor ubiquitin and a specific nucleophilic amino acid on the acceptor ubiquitin, yet it is unknown whether the fundamental feature of most acceptors-the lysine side chain-affects catalysis. Here, use of synthetic ubiquitins with non-natural acceptor site replacements reveals that the aliphatic side chain specifying reactive amine geometry is a determinant of the ubiquitin code, through unanticipated and complex reliance of many distinct ubiquitin-carrying enzymes on a canonical acceptor lysine."
https://openalex.org/W3113114665,"Uveal melanoma is the most common eye cancer in adults and is clinically and genetically distinct from skin cutaneous melanoma. In a subset of cases, the oncogenic driver is an activating mutation in CYSLTR2, the gene encoding the G protein-coupled receptor cysteinyl-leukotriene receptor 2 (CysLTR2). The mutant CYSLTR2 encodes for the CysLTR2-L129Q receptor, with the substitution of Leu to Gln at position 129 (3.43). The ability of CysLTR2-L129Q to cause malignant transformation has been hypothesized to result from constitutive activity, but how the receptor could escape desensitization is unknown. Here, we characterize the functional properties of CysLTR2-L129Q. We show that CysLTR2-L129Q is a constitutively active mutant that strongly drives Gq/11 signaling pathways. However, CysLTR2-L129Q only poorly recruits β-arrestin. Using a modified Slack-Hall operational model, we quantified the constitutive activity for both pathways and conclude that CysLTR2-L129Q displays profound signaling bias for Gq/11 signaling pathways while escaping β-arrestin-mediated downregulation. CYSLTR2 is the first known example of a G protein-coupled receptor driver oncogene that encodes a highly biased constitutively active mutant receptor. These results provide new insights into the mechanism of CysLTR2-L129Q oncoprotein signaling and suggest CYSLTR2 as a promising potential therapeutic target in uveal melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W3111013296,"The COVID-19 pandemic has interrupted everyday life virtually everywhere in the world, enabling real-life research on threat-and-defense processes. In a survey conducted within the first days of implementing social distancing measures in Austria and Germany, we aimed to explore the pathways from threat perception to preferences of defense strategies. We found that anxiety, approach-related affect, and reactance were specifically elicited by motivational (vs. epistemic) discrepancies. In a second step, we tested the mediating effect of anxiety, approach-related affect, and reactance on preferences regarding personal-social and concrete-abstract defenses. Experiencing anxiety was related to interest in security-related actions, and approach-affect was related to both personal projects and social media use. Participants experiencing reactance were more inclined to pursue personal projects (personal-abstract) and less interested in security-related (personal-concrete) actions. They also showed marginally lower system justification (social-abstract). Additionally, we examined the relationship of loneliness with defense strategies, showing that loneliness was associated with lower system justification and security behaviors. The results suggest that individuals deal with threat in their own ways, mostly depending on affective state and motivational orientation: Anxiety was related to security, approach-state to action (both social and personal), reactance to derogation of the system and disregard for security, while loneliness was associated with inaction."
https://openalex.org/W3111170165,"Gram-negative bacteria, as well as some Gram-positive bacteria, possess hair-like appendages known as fimbriae, which play an important role in adhesion of the bacteria to surfaces or to other bacteria. Unlike the sex pili or flagellum, the fimbriae are quite numerous, with of order 1000 fimbriae appendages per bacterial cell. In this paper, a recently developed hybrid model for bacterial biofilms is used to examine the role of fimbriae tension force on the mechanics of bacterial biofilms. Each bacterial cell is represented in this model by a spherocylindrical particle, which interact with each other through collision, adhesion, lubrication force, and fimbrial force. The bacterial cells absorb water and nutrients and produce extracellular polymeric substance (EPS). The flow of water and EPS, and nutrient diffusion within these substances, is computed using a continuum model that accounts for important effects such as osmotic pressure gradient, drag force on the bacterial cells, and viscous shear. The fimbrial force is modeled using an outer spherocylinder capsule around each cell, which can transmit tensile forces to neighboring cells with which the fimbriae capsule collides. We find that the biofilm structure during the growth process is dominated by a balance between outward drag force on the cells due to the EPS flow away from the bacterial colony and the inward tensile fimbrial force acting on chains of cells connected by adhesive fimbriae appendages. The fimbrial force also introduces a large rotational motion of the cells and disrupts cell alignment caused by viscous torque imposed by the EPS flow. The current paper characterizes the competing effects of EPS drag and fimbrial force using a series of computations with different values of the ratio of EPS to bacterial cell production rate and different numbers of fimbriae per cell."

There is still significant uncertainty surrounding the distribution and impact of marine plastic litter on ocean ecosystems, and in particular on the nano- and microplastic fractions that are difficult to observe and may be harmful to marine organisms. Current estimates of ocean plastic concentrations only account for a small fraction of the approximated 8 million tons of plastic litter entering the oceans on an annual basis. Here, we present the distribution of 100–500 μm microplastic particles within the ocean mixed layer, covering a significant fraction of the ocean, in a near-synoptic survey. During The Ocean Race 2017/2018 edition (formerly known as Volvo Ocean Race ), two yachts served as ships of opportunity that regularly took samples of microplastics on a regular schedule during their circumnavigation. This effort resulted in information on microplastic distribution along the race track in the ocean’s upper, well-mixed, layer. We found concentrations ranging from 0–349 particles per cubic meter, but with large spatial variability. There was a tendency toward higher concentrations off south-western Europe and in the southwest Pacific, and indications of long-range transport of microplastic with major ocean currents."

They exhibit 5' exonuclease activity on single-stranded DNA, hydrolyzing it at the acidic pH associated with the lysosome. However, their full cellular function is inadequately understood. To examine these enzymes, we developed a robust and automatable cell-based assay based on fluorophore- and fluorescence-quencher-coupled oligonucleotides for the quantitative determination of acidic 5' exonuclease activity. We validated the assay under knockout and PLD-overexpression conditions and then applied it to characterize PLD3 and PLD4 biochemically. Our experiments revealed PLD3 as the principal acid 5' exonuclease in HeLa cells, where it showed a markedly higher specific activity compared with PLD4. We further used our newly developed assay to determine the substrate specificity and inhibitory profile of PLD3 and found that proteolytic processing of PLD3 is dispensable for its hydrolytic activity. We followed the expression, proteolytic processing, and intracellular distribution of genetic PLD3 variants previously associated with Alzheimer's disease and investigated each variant's effect on the 5' nuclease activity of PLD3, finding that some variants lead to reduced activity, but others not. The development of a PLD3/4-specific biochemical assay will be instrumental in understanding better both nucleases and their incompletely understood roles in vitro and in vivo."

Thus, in this work we have exploited a single-molecule fluoresence-based assay in order to directly observe complexes formed between αBc and a model client protein, the chloride intracellular channel 1 (CLIC1) protein. We demonstrate that αBc inhibits the heat-induced amorphous aggregation of CLIC1 and that this inhibitory activity results in the formation of a polydisperse range of αBc–CLIC1 complexes. Employing our single-molecule fluorescence-based assay, we have, for the first time, determined the stoichiometries of complexes formed between αBc and a client protein and measured how these complexes change over time. Our results provide evidence for a two-step mechanism of sHsp–client interaction and provide fundamental insight into the molecular mechanisms by which sHsps interact with client proteins to prevent aggregation as part of proteostasis. CLIC proteins can exist in cells in both a soluble globular form as well as an integral membrane protein with ion channel function (31Littler D.R. Harrop S.J. Goodchild S.C. Phang J.M. Mynott A.V.

We chose to explore CLIC1 as a potential model client protein to study sHsp chaperone function because cytosolic plant sHsps have been shown to bind GST proteins in vivo following heat stress (34McLoughlin F. Basha E. Fowler M.E. Kim M. Bordowitz J. Katiyar-Agarwal S. Vierling E.J.P.P. Class I and II small heat shock proteins together with HSP101 protect protein translation factors during heat stress.Plant Physiol. 2016; 172: 1221-1236PubMed Google Scholar) and expression of the human sHsp, Hsp27 (HSPB1) protects detoxifying enzymes, such as GSTs, against inactivation in cells (35Préville X.

Destabilization of CLIC1, whether through a change in pH or temperature, results in the formation of a folding intermediate with a high degree of solvent-exposed hydrophobicity (36Fanucchi S.

Cell Biochem. 2015; 398: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), causing it to be decidedly aggregation-prone. This is typical of the client proteins of sHsps that form during times of cellular stress, whereby sHsps bind to these destabilized forms to prevent their aggregation (38Haslbeck M. Vierling E. A first line of stress defense: small heat shock proteins and their function in protein homeostasis.J. Mol. Biol. 2015; 427: 1537-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Isoforms of CLIC1 amenable to site-specific labeling at cysteine residues have been previously described (39Goodchild S.C. Angstmann C.N. Breit S.N. Curmi P.M. Brown L.J. Transmembrane extension and oligomerization of the CLIC1 chloride intracellular channel protein upon membrane interaction.Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 10887-10897Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), including an isoform in which four of the six native cysteines are mutated to alanines (C89A, C178A, C191A, C223A; herein designated CLIC1cysL). Together, these characteristics led us to develop CLIC1 as a model client protein for the study of αBc chaperone activity at the single-molecule level. We first confirmed that heat destabilization of CLIC1cysL led to its aggregation, akin to the behavior of other client proteins, including luciferase, rhodanese, alcohol dehydrogenase, and malate dehydrogenase, which are typically used to assess chaperone function (40Mymrikov E.V. Daake M. Richter B. Haslbeck M. Buchner J. The chaperone activity and substrate spectrum of human small heat shock proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292: 672-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 41Fu X. Chaperone function and mechanism of small heat-shock proteins.Acta Biochim. Biophys. Sin. 2014; 46: 347-356Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). When CLIC1cysL was incubated at 37 °C, there was a significant increase in light scattering at 340 nm over 20 h, indicative of its destabilization and subsequent aggregation (Fig. 1A). However, when CLIC1cysL was incubated in the presence of αBcWT, there was a concentration-dependent reduction in the rate and overall amount of light scatter associated with CLIC1cysL aggregation (Fig. 1, A–B). The specificity of this effect was demonstrated by a negative control (using the non-chaperone protein ovalbumin) not inhibiting the increase in light scatter associated with the aggregation of CLIC1cysL. Furthermore, there was no increase in light scatter when αBcWT was incubated alone, demonstrating that the increase in light scatter was exclusively due to the aggregation of CLIC1cysL. Analysis by size exclusion chromatography and SDS-PAGE of samples following incubation showed that, when incubated together at a molar ratio of 1:0.5 (αBcWT:CLIC1cysL), αBcWT and CLIC1cysL coeluted in early fractions (fractions 7–9) from the column, suggesting that αBcWT prevented the heat-induced aggregation of CLIC1cysL via the formation of high-molecular mass complexes (Fig. 1, C–D, Fig. S1). Thus, mild heating at 37 °C leads to the destabilization and aggregation of CLIC1, and αBcWT can inhibit this process by forming complexes with the aggregation-prone protein, demonstrating the utility of CLIC1 as a good model client protein for monitoring molecular chaperone activity. To further characterize the nature of the physical interaction between CLIC1 and αBc, we utilized a single-molecule FRET (smFRET)–based approach that allows interactions between biomolecules to be observed (at separations of 2–10 nm). For these experiments, we generated CLIC1C24, a CLIC1 isoform that contains a mutation of one of the native tryptophan residues to phenylalanine (W23F) and mutations of five of the native cysteines to alanines (C59A, C89A, C178A, C191A, and C223A); the remaining cysteine (C24) was not modified so it could be exploited for site-specific fluorescent labeling. As observed for CLIC1cysL, incubation of CLIC1C24 at 37 °C resulted in a significant increase in light scattering at 340 nm over 20 h, indicative of its aggregation, and this was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by αBcWT, but not the non-chaperone control proteins superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1: Fig. 2, A–B) or ovalbumin (Fig. S2C). Interestingly, cross-linking of αBcWT had no significant impact on its capacity to inhibit the aggregation of CLIC1C24 (Fig. S2, D–F), suggesting that dynamic subunit exchange of αBc oligomers is not required for the chaperone action in this assay. To perform smFRET on complexes formed between CLIC1 and αBc, we site-specifically labeled CLIC1C24 with an Alexa Flour 555 donor fluorophore. A mutant of αBc (αBcC176) was used in these experiments that contains an additional cysteine at the extreme C-terminus of the protein for site-specific attachment of an Alexa Fluor 647 acceptor fluorophore. The addition of the C-terminal cysteine did not affect the ability of the chaperone to inhibit CLIC1C24 aggregation (Fig. S2A) or substantially change the oligomeric distribution of the protein according to mass photometry measurements (Fig. S3). Mass photometry measurements revealed that while the addition of the fluorescent dye to the C-terminal cysteine did cause a shift in the oligomeric distribution of αBcC176 toward smaller species, the protein was still capable of forming larger oligomers. To determine if the fluorescently labeled αBcC176 could interact and form client–chaperone complexes with CLIC1C24, donor (AF555)-labeled CLIC1C24 and acceptor (AF647)-labeled αBcC176 were incubated together at 37 °C for 20 h and immobilized on a functionalised coverslip for total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy (Fig. 2C). Complexes containing colocalized CLIC1C24 and αBcC176 were observed at the single-molecule level (Fig. 2D), and the approximate time–FRET traces were calculated using the donor and acceptor fluorescence time–intensity traces (Fig. S4A). The time-FRET trajectories initially displayed high FRET efficiencies, which gradually decreased over time, likely due to the photobleaching of multiple acceptor fluorophores within the αBcC176–CLIC1C24 complexes (Fig. S4B). Analysis of the initial FRET efficiency of αBcC176–CLIC1C24 complexes prior to photobleaching showed these complexes had a high FRET efficiency (E = 0.8–1) and therefore were in close proximity, consistent with a stable interaction between αBcC176 and heat-destabilized CLIC1C24 (Fig. 2E). However, the complexity of these smFRET traces, as a result of multiple donor and acceptor fluorophores within the complexes, means calculation of accurate distances between acceptor and donor fluorophores and the precise stoichiometries of αBcC176 and CLIC1C24 cannot readily be determined using this approach. We hence sought to employ a single-molecule fluorescence-based assay that would enable the stoichiometries of αBcC176 and CLIC1C24 within complexes to be interrogated. To do so, we first investigated the binding of heated (37 °C for 2 h) site-specific fluorescently labeled CLIC1C24 (AF647-CLIC1C24) to the surface of a functionalised coverslip (Fig. 3A). As expected, there was a significant increase in the number of CLIC1C24 foci observed when the capture antibody was present (Fig. 3B). Moreover, there was no difference in the fluorescent intensities of the CLIC1C24 species bound to the coverslip in the presence or absence of the antibody (Fig. 3C), demonstrating that the CLIC1C24 bound by the antibody is representative of the CLIC1C24 species present in solution. Heated CLIC1C24 was immobilized to the functionalized coverslip much more readily than folded CLIC1C24 (Fig. 3, D–F), presumably due to increased exposure of the N-terminal His-tag as a result of CLIC1C24 unfolding. Thus, our single-molecule approach efficiently captures the thermally destabilized CLIC1C24 species that are potential clients of sHsps. We next incubated AF647-CLIC1C24 and AF488-αBcC176 together at 37 °C and collected aliquots at various timepoints over a 10-h period. Samples were then diluted and immediately immobilized to the coverslip surface (via the His-tag on CLIC1C24) for imaging using TIRF microscopy. As expected, αBcC176 (green) was observed to colocalize with CLIC1C24 molecules (magenta) (Fig. 4A), indicative of the formation of stable complexes between these two proteins and consistent with the results of the smFRET experiments (Fig. 2D). The proportion of CLIC1C24 molecules colocalized with αBcC176 increased rapidly over 1 h (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, after 4 h, the proportion of CLIC1C24 colocalized with αBcC176 reached a maximum of approximately 50%, demonstrating that not all CLIC1C24 molecules were in complex with αBcC176 under these experimental conditions (these CLIC1C24 molecules not in complex with αBcC176 are herein referred to as free CLIC1C24 species). Additionally, despite having blocked (passivated) the coverslip surface, which significantly reduced the nonspecific binding of αBcC176 to the coverslip, some nonspecific binding of αBcC176 molecules not in complex with CLIC1C24 was also observed (herein referred to as free αBcC176 species) (Fig. 4A). Negative stain transmission electron microscopy (TEM) demonstrated the heterogeneous nature of the AF488-αBcC176 oligomers and the species present following incubation of AF647-CLIC1C24 and AF488-αBcC176 at 37 °C (Fig. S5). This heterogeneity precluded any detailed analysis of complexes formed between CLIC1C24 and αBcC176 via TEM; however, we did observe an apparent reduction in the size of species in samples containing both CLIC1C24 and αBcC176 compared with those containing only αBcC176. To determine the stoichiometries of CLIC1C24 and αBcC176 in complexes formed under conditions in which CLIC1C24 is prone to aggregation, molecules were imaged until all fluorophores were completely photobleached. CLIC1C24 and αBcC176 trajectories with distinct photobleaching steps were identified manually and used to calculate the fluorescent intensity of each single-photobleaching event (Is) (Fig. 4C, Figs. S6, A and D and S7B). The Is values collected from CLIC1C24 and αBcC176 trajectories containing one distinct photobleaching step were not significantly different when the proteins were in a complex or alone (αBcC176 nonspecifically bound to the surface was used to assess the protein when not in a complex) (Fig. S6, B and E). Therefore, binding of the two proteins into a complex did not significantly affect the fluorescent intensity of the fluorophores attached to the proteins. Analysis of trajectories from CLIC1C24–αBcC176 complexes that contained multiple distinct photobleaching steps showed a broader distribution of IS values than complexes containing only a single unit of either protein (Fig. S6, B and E). Thus, to establish the number of CLIC1C24 or αBcC176 in complexes, Is values calculated from trajectories with multiple distinct photobleaching steps were fit to a Gaussian distribution from which the mean intensity of a single photobleaching event (Is-mean) for CLIC1C24 or αBcC176 was derived (Fig. 4D, Fig. S7C). The Is-mean values determined using change point analysis were 170.5 ± 99 a.u and 166 ± 119 a.u for CLIC1C24 and αBcC176, respectively. These values were then used to determine the number of fluorescently labeled proteins per point (FPP). The initial fluorescence intensities (I0) for CLIC1C24 and αBcC176 in each complex were calculated by averaging the first 20 intensity values (Fig. 4C, Fig. S7B). Change point analysis was not used to calculate I0 owing to its inability to accurately fit photobleaching steps of larger complexes (i.e., >10mers). Furthermore, calculation of I0 via either change point analysis or averaging of the initial 20 intensity values of trajectories yielded similar values when used to analyze CLIC1C24 and αBcC176 trajectories (<10mers) with multiple distinct photobleaching steps (Fig. S6, C and F). Subsequently I0 for CLIC1C24 and αBcC176 in each complex was divided by the appropriate Is-mean to calculate the FPP. These FPP values were then used to determine the number of subunits of each protein present in complexes of up to a maximum of 20 subunits (Fig. 4E, Fig. S7D; see Two-color TIRF microscopy data and statistical analysis in the Experimental procedures section). To investigate whether the dilution and immobilization of αBcC176–CLIC1C24 complexes required for this single-molecule fluorescence approach affected the nature of the complexes formed at higher concentrations, complexes were cross-linked prior to dilution and single-molecule measurements (Fig. S8). When αBcC176 was cross-linked in the absence of CLIC1C24 and diluted for TIRF microscopy, a small decrease in the αBcC176 oligomer size indicative of some dissociation of large oligomers was observed (Fig. S8, A–C). However, this decrease in the size of αBcC176 oligomers was not observed when it was in complex with CLIC1C24 (Fig. S8, E, G and H). Furthermore, the size and amount of CLIC1C24 in complex with αBcC176 was not significantly affected by dilution and immobilization of the complexes (Fig. S8, E, G and H), indicating that the complexes observed by single-molecule fluorescence imaging are representative of those formed during the incubation at 37 °C. However, when comparing the size distributions of αBcC176 observed by this single-molecule fluorescence approach with those obtained by mass photometry, it is apparent that the single-molecule fluorescence approach primarily detects the smaller oligomers (<10 subunits) (Fig. S8D). To obtain further information on the interaction between αBcC176 and CLIC1C24, we examined the change in size and composition of the αBcC176–CLIC1C24 complexes over time, as well as the size of the molecules that were not in complex. Prior to incubation, both CLIC1C24 and αBcC176 were present predominantly as smaller noncolocalized species (Fig. 5, A and E). Following incubation at 37 °C for 0.25 h, αBcC17"

Cytokinesis in prokaryotes is a highly organized cellular process wherein a network of widely conserved cell division proteins function together to divide a single bacterial cell into two identical daughter cells (1Egan A.J. Vollmer W. The physiology of bacterial cell division.Ann. NY Acad. Sci. 2013; 1277: 8-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, cell division commences with the assembly of a large ring-like protein structure termed the Z-ring, which contains bundled polymers of the GTPase FtsZ, and FtsZ-interacting proteins including FtsA and ZipA, and serves as the site of constriction (2Lutkenhaus J. Pichoff S. Du S. Bacterial cytokinesis: from Z ring to divisome.Cytoskeleton. 2012; 69: 778-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The Z-ring is a highly dynamic structure wherein FtsZ subunits are rapidly exchanged with a cytoplasmic pool via cycles of GTP binding and hydrolysis (3Stricker J. Maddox P. Salmon E.D. Erickson H.P.

A. 2002; 99: 3171-3175Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Many proteins interact with FtsZ to spatially and temporally regulate Z-ring assembly, and a number of these proteins modulate FtsZ dynamics in the Z-ring (4Viola M.G. LaBreck C.J. Conti J.

The Min system of E. coli functions to spatially regulate the site of cell division by inhibiting establishment of the Z-ring near the cell poles. MinD is one of three components of the Min system of proteins in E. coli, which includes MinC, MinD, and MinE. These proteins oscillate across the longitudinal axis of the cell to prevent Z-ring assembly at the poles in E. coli (5Lutkenhaus J. Assembly dynamics of the bacterial MinCDE system and spatial regulation of the Z ring.Ann. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 539-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The Min system is used by several taxa to regulate division-site selection; however, the oscillation observed in E. coli is not preserved across all organisms that contain a Min system, and some organisms lack a Min system entirely (5Lutkenhaus J.

Although several groups have reported copolymer formation in vitro, the physiological consequences of MinCD assembly in vivo are largely unknown. The Lutkenhaus group reported that MinD mutants that fail to polymerize with MinC, but still interact with MinC at the membrane, do not result in functional defects in vivo (17Park K.T. Du S. Lutkenhaus J. MinC/MinD copolymers are not required for Min function.Mol. Microbiol. 2015; 98: 895-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Although copolymers are not essential to complete division in vivo, their assembly may modify Min patterning or oscillation rates in vivo through direct competition of accessible MinD surfaces by MinC and MinE (7LaBreck C.J.

In several prokaryotes, cytokinesis is regulated proteolytically by the two-component ATP-dependent protease ClpXP (18Camberg J.L. Wickner S.

ClpXP contains both an unfoldase, ClpX, which is a hexameric ring-like AAA+ (ATPase Associated with diverse cellular Activities) ATPase, and the compartmentalized serine protease, ClpP, which is composed of two stacked heptameric rings (24Sauer R.T.

Sculpting the proteome with AAA(+) proteases and disassembly machines.Cell. 2004; 119: 9-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The ClpX unfoldase contains an N-terminal substrate-binding domain, also called the zinc-binding domain, that can undergo dimerization in solution and engages some substrates, including FtsZ and phage lambda O (λO) protein, in addition to substrate-specific adaptor proteins, such as SspB (20Camberg J.L.

After engagement of a substrate, ClpX uses ATP hydrolysis to unfold and translocate substrates through its axial channel into the central chamber of ClpP for degradation (28Grimaud R. Kessel M.

Furthermore, ClpXP is a major regulator of protein stability and intracellular protein levels during stationary-phase adaptation and other stress conditions (23Flynn J.M. Neher S.B. Kim Y.I.

Global role for ClpP-containing proteases in stationary-phase adaptation of Escherichia coli.J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Here, to determine if E. coli ClpXP regulates Min system function in E. coli by direct degradation of MinD and to understand how ClpX targets MinD, we reconstituted in vitro degradation assays with MinD and MinD-containing complexes, including MinCD copolymers. We show that ClpXP degrades MinD and destabilizes MinCD copolymers in vitro. Destabilization of MinCD copolymers is another example, in addition to FtsZ, which shows that ClpXP-dependent remodeling and degradation of large polymeric protein assemblies lead to their disassembly. We further demonstrate that ClpXP degrades MinD during stationary phase and that intracellular ClpXP levels modify Min function in vivo. MinD was previously identified as a substrate for ClpXP degradation in E. coli W3110 (22Neher S.B. Villen J. Oakes E.C. Bakalarski C.E. Sauer R.T. Gygi S.P. Baker T.A. Proteomic profiling of ClpXP substrates after DNA damage reveals extensive instability within SOS regulon.Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 193-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In vivo, deletion of either clpX or clpP from a minC deletion strain in E. coli MG1655 leads to a synthetic filamentous phenotype during exponential growth (31Camberg J.L. Hoskins J.R. Wickner S. The interplay of ClpXP with the cell division machinery in Escherichia coli.J. Bacteriol. 2011; 193: 1911-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). FtsZ, the major component of the Z-ring, is also degraded by ClpXP, and an imbalance of FtsZ levels leads to filamentation (4Viola M.G. LaBreck C.J. Conti J. Camberg J.L. Proteolysis-dependent remodeling of the tubulin homolog FtsZ at the division Septum in Escherichia coli.PLoS One. 2017; 12: e0170505Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 20Camberg J.L. Hoskins J.R. Wickner S. ClpXP protease degrades the cytoskeletal protein, FtsZ, and modulates FtsZ polymer dynamics.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2009; 106: 10614-10619Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To further understand how degradation of MinD by ClpXP impacts Min function during division, we first developed an in vitro degradation assay using purified proteins. MinD (6 μM) was incubated with ClpX (1.0 μM), ClpP (1.2 μM), and ATP for 3 h, and degradation was measured by monitoring the loss of full-length MinD in the reaction with time (Fig. 1A). After incubation of MinD with ClpXP and ATP, we detected 45.9% less MinD after 3 h (Fig. 1A); however, when either ATP or ClpP was omitted from reactions, the level of MinD did not change over the course of the experiment indicating that MinD is degraded by ClpXP in an ATP-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). To quantitatively measure the rate of degradation in reconstituted reactions in vitro, we labeled MinD with Alexa fluor 488 and measured degradation by monitoring fluorescent peptides released following incubation with ClpXP and ATP. Degradation reactions containing ClpXP (0.8 μM), ATP (8 mM), and MinD (10 μM) were stopped by the addition of EDTA (50 mM), and fluorescent peptides were collected by ultrafiltration and quantified by fluorescence. We observed that the amount of MinD degraded increased linearly over the course of 30 min (Fig. 1B). Next, we examined the rate of MinD degradation by ClpXP with increasing MinD concentration (0–16 μM). We observed a concentration-dependent increase in the rate of MinD degradation, which plateaus near 20 μM MinD, with a rate of 0.08 ± 0.01 min−1 (Fig. 1C). The degradation rate of another substrate, FtsZ, has also been shown to increase with increasing substrate concentration, which suggests a low-affinity interaction at low substrate concentrations (4Viola M.G. LaBreck C.J. Conti J. Camberg J.L. Proteolysis-dependent remodeling of the tubulin homolog FtsZ at the division Septum in Escherichia coli.PLoS One. 2017; 12: e0170505Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 20Camberg J.L. Hoskins J.R. Wickner S. ClpXP protease degrades the cytoskeletal protein, FtsZ, and modulates FtsZ polymer dynamics.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2009; 106: 10614-10619Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Together, these results demonstrate that ClpXP recognizes and degrades MinD in a concentration-dependent manner. In the presence of ATP, MinD binds to E. coli phospholipids by inserting a C-terminal amphipathic helix into the phospholipid bilayer and recruits MinC to phospholipids in vitro. MinE also binds to membrane-associated MinD in vitro. MinE stimulates ATP hydrolysis by MinD in the presence of phospholipids, and then MinD dissociates from the phospholipid bilayer (32Hu Z. Gogol E.P. Lutkenhaus J. Dynamic assembly of MinD on phospholipid vesicles regulated by ATP and MinE.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6761-6766Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 33Lackner L.L. Raskin D.M. de Boer P.A. ATP-dependent interactions between Escherichia coli Min proteins and the phospholipid membrane in vitro.J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 735-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Because MinD is capable of binding directly to MinC, MinE, and phospholipids, we tested if the addition of E. coli phospholipids, prepared as small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs), modifies the rate of MinD degradation in the absence and the presence of MinC and MinE. We observed that during the interaction with SUVs, MinC (5 μM) or MinE (10 μM) had no significant impact on the rate of MinD degradation by ClpXP under the conditions tested (Fig. 1D). Finally, to confirm that ClpXP does not also degrade MinC or MinE, we monitored degradation of both MinC and MinE, but detected no proteolysis of either protein after 3 h, and autoproteolysis of ClpX was observed (Fig. 1E). MinC and MinD from E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and A. aeolicus readily form copolymers in the presence of ATP composed of alternating dimers (13Ghosal D. Trambaiolo D. Amos L.A. Lowe J. MinCD cell division proteins form alternating copolymeric cytomotive filaments.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 5341Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 14Conti J. Viola M.G. Camberg J.L.

Osawa M. Erickson H.P. Chen Y. The cell division protein MinD from Pseudomonas aeruginosa dominates the assembly of the MinC-MinD copolymers.J. Biol.

Cryo-EM structure of the MinCD copolymeric filament from Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 3.1 A resolution.FEBS Lett. 2019; 593: 1915-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). ClpXP is known to disassemble FtsZ polymers in vitro (4Viola M.G. LaBreck C.J. Conti J. Camberg J.L. Proteolysis-dependent remodeling of the tubulin homolog FtsZ at the division Septum in Escherichia coli.PLoS One. 2017; 12: e0170505Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 20Camberg J.L. Hoskins J.R. Wickner S. ClpXP protease degrades the cytoskeletal protein, FtsZ, and modulates FtsZ polymer dynamics.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2009; 106: 10614-10619Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar); therefore, we tested if ClpXP could also prevent assembly of alternating MinCD copolymers or destabilize them after they assemble. First, to test if the presence of ClpXP in a MinCD assembly reaction reduces or prevents copolymerization of MinD with ATP and MinC in vitro, we monitored 90° light scatter of reactions containing MinD (8 μM), MinC (4 μM), and then added ATP alone or with ClpX and/or ClpP, where indicated (Fig. 2, A–B). Light scatter was then monitored for an additional 30 min. The addition of ATP without ClpXP stimulated robust copolymer formation; however, the addition of ATP and ClpXP lead to a small increase in light scatter that rapidly decreased with time (Fig. 2A). Next, we tested if ClpX impairs MinCD assembly without ClpP because inhibition of MinCD copolymer assembly could potentially result from MinD unfolding by ClpX, but not degradation. Interestingly, we found that the addition of ClpX resulted in a 45% inhibition of copolymerization (Fig. 2B). To determine if the inhibition required ATP hydrolysis, and therefore also ATP-dependent substrate unfolding, or binding only, we tested if the ClpX ATPase mutant protein, ClpX(E185Q), which hexamerizes and binds substrates but does not unfold them, impairs copolymer formation. Similar to wildtype ClpX, we observed a 45% reduction in the light scatter increase in response to ATP addition, suggesting that the binding, but not unfolding, partially reduces MinCD copolymer abundance (Fig. 2B). Together, these results suggest that ClpX prevents MinCD assembly independently of ClpP and ATP hydrolysis, but that ClpXP is substantially more effective for preventing assembly and/or destabilizing MinCD copolymers (Fig. 2, A–B). Addition of an equivalent volume of buffer or ClpP alone does not inhibit copolymer formation in control experiments (Fig. 2B). Together, our results suggest that MinCD copolymer assembly is prevented by ClpXP in vitro and, to a lesser extent, by ClpX. Next to determine if ClpXP destabilizes preassembled MinCD copolymers, we performed an order of addition experiment. First, copolymers were preassembled with ATP, and then ClpXP (0.5–0.9 μM) was added, and we monitored light scatter for another 30 min to detect MinCD copolymers. After assembly of MinCD polymers, addition of ClpXP to the reaction led to a rapid decrease in light scatter that correlated with increased ClpXP concentration (Fig. 2C). In contrast, the addition of buffer, ClpX, or ClpP failed to destabilize assembled MinCD copolymers (Fig. S1A). Finally, we directly visualized copolymers via negative staining transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and compared MinCD copolymer abundance and morphology to copolymers incubated with ClpXP. Consistent with previous reports, we observed MinCD copolymers with ATP (8 mM) (Fig. 2D). Many copolymers were straight and single stranded; however, we also observed bundles of copolymers. Next, reactions containing ClpXP (0.8 μM) with ATP (8 mM) alone or added to MinCD copolymers, preassembled with ATP, were incubated for 15 min, and reaction products were analyzed by TEM. In the presence of ClpXP, we observed fewer copolymers that were shorter and spread more sparsely across the grid (Fig. 2E), compared with copolymers without ClpXP (Fig. 2D). To confirm that polymers were not observed in reactions containing ClpXP alone, we visualized ClpXP (0.9 μM) assembled with ATP (4 mM). We detected a homogeneous population of ClpXP particles (Fig. 2F) and did not observe any polymeric structures. These results suggest that the ClpXP destabilizes MinCD copolymers, and ClpX is sufficient to prevent assembly of MinCD copolymers through binding and is independent of ATP hydrolysis. In the structural model of MinCD, copolymers are comprised of alternating MinC and MinD dimers (13Ghosal D. Trambaiolo D. Amos L.A. Lowe J. MinCD cell division proteins form alternating copolymeric cytomotive filaments.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 5341Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). Therefore, it is possible that copolymer destabilization by ClpXP could arise from degradation of MinC or a failure of MinC to dimerize and/or interact with MinD. As described, we observed no degradation of MinC by SDS–PAGE after incubation with ClpXP and ATP (Fig. 1E); therefore, copolymer disassembly does not likely occur via MinC engagement. In a control experiment, Gfp–ssrA was rapidly degraded by ClpXP (Fig. S1B). Substrate recognition by ClpX is mediated by the presence of different sequence motifs, or degrons, at the N- or C-terminal regions of protein substrates (23Flynn J.M. Neher S.B. Kim Y.I. Sauer R.T.

The N terminus of MinD contains amino acids that bear similarity to the N motif-2 consensus motif (M-b-ϕ-ϕ-ϕ-X5-ϕ) identified for ClpX (22Neher S.B. Villen J. Oakes E.C. Bakalarski C.E. Sauer R.T.

In the structural model of MinD, Arg 3 is present near the N terminus, outside the dimer interface, and accessible to the surface (Fig. 3A). To determine if this arginine is important for recognition by ClpX, we mutagenized the residue to glutamate and purified MinD(R3E). In degradation reactions with ClpXP in vitro, we observed that 50% of wildtype MinD was degraded in the first 60 min; however, we detected no MinD(R3E) degradation during the experiment under the conditions tested (Fig. 3B). To confirm that MinD(R3E) is not defective for function, we measured the ability of MinE to stimulate ATP hydrolysis of MinD(R3E) in the presence of SUVs. We observed that the ATP hydrolysis rate of MinD(R3E) (8 μM) was stimulated 10-fold by MinE (16 μM) and SUVs (1 mg ml−1), similar to wildtype MinD, suggesting that the amino acid substitution does not impair MinD function (Fig. 3C). MinD(R3E) is defective for degradation by ClpXP but copolymerizes with MinC (Fig. 3D); therefore, we tested if whether copolymers containing MinD(R3E) and MinC are resistant to destabilization by ClpXP. As expected, we observed that ClpXP failed to destabilize preassembled MinC/MinD(R3E) po"

In 2009, a devastating potato bacterial wilt outbreak was declared in the central highlands of Madagascar, which reduced the production of vegetable crops including potato, eggplant, tomato and pepper. A molecular epidemiology study of Malagasy RSSC strains carried out between 2013 and 2017 identified R . pseudosolanacearum (phylotypes I and III) and R . solanacearum (phylotype II). A previously published population biology analysis of phylotypes II and III using two MultiLocus Variable Number of Tandem Repeats Analysis (MLVA) schemes revealed an emergent epidemic phylotype II (sequevar 1) group and endemic phylotype III isolates. We developed an optimized MLVA scheme (RS1-MLVA14) to characterize phylotype I strains in Madagascar to understand their genetic diversity and structure. The collection included isolates from 16 fields of different Solanaceae species sampled in Analamanga and Itasy regions (highlands) in 2013 (123 strains) and in Atsinanana region (lowlands) in 2006 (25 strains). Thirty-one haplotypes were identified, two of them being particularly prevalent: MT007 (30.14%) and MT004 (16.44%) (sequevar 18). Genetic diversity analysis revealed a significant contrasting level of diversity according to elevation and sampling region. More diverse at low altitude than at high altitude, the Malagasy phylotype I isolates were structured in two clusters, probably resulting from different historical introductions. Interestingly, the most prevalent Malagasy phylotype I isolates were genetically distant from regional and worldwide isolates. In this work, we demonstrated that the RS1-MLVA14 scheme can resolve differences from regional to field scales and is thus suited for deciphering the epidemiology of phylotype I populations."
https://openalex.org/W3111714631,"Background The timely administration of vaccines is considered to be important for both individual and herd immunity. In this study, we investigated the timeliness of the diphtheria-tetanus-whole cell pertussis-hepatitis B- Haemophilus influenzae type b (pentavalent) vaccine, scheduled at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic. We also investigated factors associated with delayed immunization. Methods 1162 children aged 8–28 months who had received the full course of the pentavalent vaccine at different levels of the health care system were enrolled. Vaccination dates documented in hospital records and/or immunisation cards were recorded. Age at vaccination and time intervals between doses were calculated. Predictors for timely completion with the pentavalent vaccine at 24 weeks were assessed by bivariate and multivariable analyses. Results Several discrepancies in dates between vaccination documents were observed. In general, vaccination with the pentavalent vaccine was found to be delayed, especially in health care settings below the provincial hospital level. Compared to the central hospital level, less participants who were vaccinated at the district/health center level received the third dose by 16 (48% at the central hospital level vs. 7.1% at the district and 12.4% at the health center level) and 24 weeks of age (94.4% at the central hospital level vs 64.6% at the district-outreach and 57.4% at the health center level) respectively. In logistic regression analyses, lower education level of the mother as well as vaccination by outreach service, were independently associated with delayed completion of vaccination. Conclusion We observed a general delay of vaccination, especially at lower ranked facilities, which correlated with indicators of poor access to health services. This highlights the need for further improving health equity in rural areas. Age-appropriate vaccination should become a quality indicator for the national immunization programme. In addition, we recommend further training of the health care staff regarding the importance of reliable documentation of dates."

https://openalex.org/W3112044147,"Drug delivery systems are a new approach to increase therapeutic efficacy and to reduce the side effects of traditional treatments. Calcium phosphates (CaPs) have been studied as drug delivery systems, especially in bone diseases. However, each system has some particularities that depend on the physical and chemical characteristics of the biomaterials and drug interaction. In this work, granulated CaPs were used as a matrix for loading the anticancer drug carboplatin using the high-vacuum method. Five compositions were applied: hydroxyapatite (HA), β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP), biphasic HAp 60%/β-TCP 40% (BCP), β-TCP/MgO nanocomposite, and β-TCP/SiO 2 nanocomposite. Carboplatin drug in 50, 60, and 70 mg/g was precipitated on the surface of CaPs. Morphological, chemical and surface modifications in the carboplatin-CaPs were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), backscattered electron microscopy (BSE), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), and Raman spectroscopy. The characterization of the CaP-carboplatin biomaterials showed heterogeneous crystalline precipitation of the drug, and no morphological modifications of the CaPs biomaterials. The in vitro release profile of carboplatin from CaPs was evaluated by the ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) method. The curves showed a burst release of upon 60% of carboplatin loaded followed by a slow-release of the drug for the time of the study. The results were typical of a low-interaction system and physisorption mechanism. The high-vacuum method permitted to load the high amount of carboplatin drug on the surface of the biomaterials despite the low interaction between carboplatin and CaPs."

Continuous map generalization technology can be used to generate arbitrary scale map data. This paper proposes a morphing method for continuously generalizing linear map features using shape context matching and hierarchical interpolation (SCM-HI). More specifically, shape characteristics are quantitatively described by shape context on which shape similarity is measured based on a chi-square method; then, two levels of interpolation, skeleton and detail interpolations, are employed to generate the geometry of intermediate curves. The main contributions of our approach include (1) exploiting both the geometry and spatial structure of a vector curve in shape matching by using shape context, and (2) preserving both the main shape structure as-rigid-as-possible and local geometric details as gradual and smooth as possible for intermediate curves by hierarchical interpolation. Experiments show that our method generates plausible morphing effects and can thus serve as a robust approach for continuous generalization of linear map features."

https://openalex.org/W3111348174,"We found a startling correlation (Pearson ρ &gt; 0.97) between a single event in daily sea surface temperatures each spring, and peak fish egg abundance measurements the following summer, in 7 years of approximately weekly fish egg abundance data collected at Scripps Pier in La Jolla California. Even more surprising was that this event-based result persisted despite the large and variable number of fish species involved (up to 46), and the large and variable time interval between trigger and response (up to ~3 months). To mitigate potential over-fitting, we made an out-of-sample prediction beyond the publication process for the peak summer egg abundance observed at Scripps Pier in 2020 (available on bioRxiv). During peer-review, the prediction failed, and while it would be tempting to explain this away as a result of the record-breaking toxic algal bloom that occurred during the spring (9x higher concentration of dinoflagellates than ever previously recorded), a re-examination of our methodology revealed a potential source of over-fitting that had not been evaluated for robustness. This cautionary tale highlights the importance of testable true out-of-sample predictions of future values that cannot (even accidentally) be used in model fitting, and that can therefore catch model assumptions that may otherwise escape notice. We believe that this example can benefit the current push towards ecology as a predictive science and support the notion that predictions should live and die in the public domain, along with the models that made them."
