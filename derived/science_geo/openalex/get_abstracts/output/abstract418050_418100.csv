https://openalex.org/W1970145665,"The TET (ten-eleven translocation) family of α-ketoglutarate (α-KG)-dependent dioxygenases catalyzes the sequential oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine and 5-carboxylcytosine, leading to eventual DNA demethylation. The TET2 gene is a bona fide tumor suppressor frequently mutated in leukemia, and TET enzyme activity is inhibited in IDH1/2-mutated tumors by the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate, an antagonist of α-KG, linking 5mC oxidation to cancer development. We report here that the levels of 5hmC are dramatically reduced in human breast, liver, lung, pancreatic and prostate cancers when compared with the matched surrounding normal tissues. Associated with the 5hmC decrease is the substantial reduction of the expression of all three TET genes, revealing a possible mechanism for the reduced 5hmC in cancer cells. The decrease of 5hmC was also observed during tumor development in different genetically engineered mouse models. Together, our results identify 5hmC as a biomarker whose decrease is broadly and tightly associated with tumor development."
https://openalex.org/W1996757213,"Cancer cells exist in a mechanically and chemically heterogeneous microenvironment which undergoes dynamic changes throughout neoplastic progression. During metastasis, cells from a primary tumor acquire characteristics that enable them to escape from the primary tumor and migrate through the heterogeneous stromal environment to establish secondary tumors. Despite being linked to poor prognosis, there are no direct clinical tests available to diagnose the likelihood of metastasis. Moreover, the physical mechanisms employed by metastatic cancer cells to migrate are poorly understood. Because metastasis of most solid tumors requires cells to exert force to reorganize and navigate through dense stroma, we investigated differences in cellular force generation between metastatic and non-metastatic cells. Using traction force microscopy, we found that in human metastatic breast, prostate and lung cancer cell lines, traction stresses were significantly increased compared to non-metastatic counterparts. This trend was recapitulated in the isogenic MCF10AT series of breast cancer cells. Our data also indicate that increased matrix stiffness and collagen density promote increased traction forces, and that metastatic cells generate higher forces than non-metastatic cells across all matrix properties studied. Additionally, we found that cell spreading for these cell lines has a direct relationship with collagen density, but a biphasic relationship with substrate stiffness, indicating that cell area alone does not dictate the magnitude of traction stress generation. Together, these data suggest that cellular contractile force may play an important role in metastasis, and that the physical properties of the stromal environment may regulate cellular force generation. These findings are critical for understanding the physical mechanisms of metastasis and the role of the extracellular microenvironment in metastatic progression."

https://openalex.org/W1980473722,"The MDM2–p53 feedback loop is crucially important for restricting p53 level and activity during normal cell growth and proliferation, and is thus subjected to dynamic regulation in order for cells to activate p53 upon various stress signals. Several ribosomal proteins, such as RPL11, RPL5, RPL23, RPL26 or RPS7, have been shown to have a role in regulation of this feedback loop in response to ribosomal stress. Here, we identify another ribosomal protein S14, which is highly associated with 5q-syndrome, as a novel activator of p53 by inhibiting MDM2 activity. We found that RPS14, but not RPS19, binds to the central acidic domain of MDM2, similar to RPL5 and RPL23, and inhibits its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity toward p53. This RPS14–MDM2 binding was induced upon ribosomal stress caused by actinomycin D or mycophenolic acid. Overexpression of RPS14, but not RPS19, elevated p53 level and activity, leading to G1 or G2 arrest. Conversely, knockdown of RPS14 alleviated p53 induction by these two reagents. Interestingly, knockdown of either RPS14 or RPS19 caused a ribosomal stress that led to p53 activation, which was impaired by further knocking down the level of RPL11 or RPL5. Together, our results demonstrate that RPS14 and RPS19 have distinct roles in regulating the MDM2–p53 feedback loop in response to ribosomal stress."
https://openalex.org/W1989961897,"Null hypothesis significance testing has been under attack in recent years, partly owing to the arbitrary nature of setting α (the decision-making threshold and probability of Type I error) at a constant value, usually 0.05. If the goal of null hypothesis testing is to present conclusions in which we have the highest possible confidence, then the only logical decision-making threshold is the value that minimizes the probability (or occasionally, cost) of making errors. Setting α to minimize the combination of Type I and Type II error at a critical effect size can easily be accomplished for traditional statistical tests by calculating the α associated with the minimum average of α and β at the critical effect size. This technique also has the flexibility to incorporate prior probabilities of null and alternate hypotheses and/or relative costs of Type I and Type II errors, if known. Using an optimal α results in stronger scientific inferences because it estimates and minimizes both Type I errors and relevant Type II errors for a test. It also results in greater transparency concerning assumptions about relevant effect size(s) and the relative costs of Type I and II errors. By contrast, the use of α = 0.05 results in arbitrary decisions about what effect sizes will likely be considered significant, if real, and results in arbitrary amounts of Type II error for meaningful potential effect sizes. We cannot identify a rationale for continuing to arbitrarily use α = 0.05 for null hypothesis significance tests in any field, when it is possible to determine an optimal α."
https://openalex.org/W2001488800,"The endothelium plays a pivotal role in the progression of solid tumors and is considered a highly relevant target for therapy. However, it emerges that current clinical angiogenesis inhibitors that act through inhibition of tumor-derived growth factors are prone to inducing drug resistance. Therefore, markers of tumor endothelial cells (ECs) themselves provide attractive novel therapeutic targets. In a screen for markers of tumor angiogenesis, we recently identified high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), known to act as proinflammatory cytokine and chromatin-binding molecule. Here we report on the role of HMGB1 in angiogenesis by showing that its overexpression is associated with an increased angiogenic potential of ECs. HMGB1 stimulates the expression of players in vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor signaling, both in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, we show that HMGB1 triggers and helps to sustain this proangiogenic gene expression program in ECs, additionally characterized by increased activity of matrix metalloproteinases, integrins and nuclear factor-κB. Moreover, we found that HMGB1 is involved in several autocrine and/or paracrine feedback mechanisms resulting in positive enforcement of HMGB1 expression, and that of its receptors, RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end products) and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Interference in HMGB1 expression and/or function using knockdown approaches and antibody-mediated targeting to break this vicious circle resulted in inhibited migration and sprouting of ECs. Using different in vivo models, therapeutic efficacy of HMGB1 targeting was confirmed. First, we demonstrated induction of HMGB1 expression in the chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) neovasculature following both photodynamic therapy and tumor challenge. We subsequently showed that anti-HMGB1 antibodies inhibited vessel density in both models, accompanied by a reduced vascular expression of angiogenic growth factor receptors. Collectively, these data identify HMGB1 as an important modulator of tumor angiogenesis and suggest the feasibility of targeting HMGB1 for multi-level cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1987297468,"This study aimed to identify the causative agent of mass mortality in wild and captive birds in southwest Germany and to gather insights into the phylogenetic relationship and spatial distribution of the pathogen. Since June 2011, 223 dead birds were collected and tested for the presence of viral pathogens. Usutu virus (USUV) RNA was detected by real-time RT-PCR in 86 birds representing 6 species. The virus was isolated in cell culture from the heart of 18 Blackbirds (Turdus merula). USUV-specific antigen was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry in brain, heart, liver, and lung of infected Blackbirds. The complete polyprotein coding sequence was obtained by deep sequencing of liver and spleen samples of a dead Blackbird from Mannheim (BH65/11-02-03). Phylogenetic analysis of the German USUV strain BH65/11-02-03 revealed a close relationship with strain Vienna that caused mass mortality among birds in Austria in 2001. Wild birds from lowland river valleys in southwest Germany were mainly affected by USUV, but also birds kept in aviaries. Our data suggest that after the initial detection of USUV in German mosquitoes in 2010, the virus spread in 2011 and caused epizootics among wild and captive birds in southwest Germany. The data also indicate an increased risk of USUV infections in humans in Germany."
https://openalex.org/W2017468538,"Bluetongue (BT) is an arthropod-borne viral disease, which primarily affects ruminants in tropical and temperate regions of the world. Twenty six bluetongue virus (BTV) serotypes have been recognised worldwide, including nine from Europe and fifteen in the United States. Identification of BTV serotype is important for vaccination programmes and for BTV epidemiology studies. Traditional typing methods (virus isolation and serum or virus neutralisation tests (SNT or VNT)) are slow (taking weeks, depend on availability of reference virus-strains or antisera) and can be inconclusive. Nucleotide sequence analyses and phylogenetic comparisons of genome segment 2 (Seg-2) encoding BTV outer-capsid protein VP2 (the primary determinant of virus serotype) were completed for reference strains of BTV-1 to 26, as well as multiple additional isolates from different geographic and temporal origins. The resulting Seg-2 database has been used to develop rapid (within 24 h) and reliable RT–PCR-based typing assays for each BTV type. Multiple primer-pairs (at least three designed for each serotype) were widely tested, providing an initial identification of serotype by amplification of a cDNA product of the expected size. Serotype was confirmed by sequencing of the cDNA amplicons and phylogenetic comparisons to previously characterised reference strains. The results from RT-PCR and sequencing were in perfect agreement with VNT for reference strains of all 26 BTV serotypes, as well as the field isolates tested. The serotype-specific primers showed no cross-amplification with reference strains of the remaining 25 serotypes, or multiple other isolates of the more closely related heterologous BTV types. The primers and RT–PCR assays developed in this study provide a rapid, sensitive and reliable method for the identification and differentiation of the twenty-six BTV serotypes, and will be updated periodically to maintain their relevance to current BTV distribution and epidemiology (http://www.reoviridae.org/dsRNA_virus_proteins/ReoID/rt-pcr-primers.htm)."
https://openalex.org/W2030217455,"Mutation of the p53 gene is the most common genetic alteration in human cancer and contributes to malignant process by enhancing transformed properties of cells and resistance to anticancer therapy. Mutant p53 is often highly expressed in tumor cells at least, in part, due to its increased half-life. However, whether mutant p53 expression is regulated by other mechanisms in tumors is unclear. Here we found that histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors suppress both wild-type and mutant p53 transcription in time- and dose-dependent manners. Consistent with this, the levels of wild-type and mutant p53 proteins are decreased upon treatment with HDAC inhibitors. Importantly, we found that upon knockdown of each class I HDAC, only HDAC8 knockdown leads to decreased expression of wild-type and mutant p53 proteins and transcripts. Conversely, we found that ectopic expression of wild-type, but not mutant HDAC8, leads to increased transcription of p53. Furthermore, we found that knockdown of HDAC8 results in reduced expression of HoxA5 and consequently, attenuated ability of HoxA5 to activate p53 transcription, which can be rescued by ectopic expression of HoxA5. Because of the fact that HDAC8 is required for expression of both wild-type and mutant p53, we found that targeted disruption of HDAC8 expression remarkably triggers proliferative defect in cells with a mutant, but not wild-type, p53. Together, our data uncover a regulatory mechanism of mutant p53 transcription via HDAC8 and suggest that HDAC inhibitors and especially HDAC8-targeting agents might be explored as an adjuvant for tumors carrying a mutant p53."
https://openalex.org/W1980872243,"Past studies of the human intestinal microbiota are potentially confounded by the common practice of using bowel-cleansing preparations. We examined if colonic lavage changes the natural state of enteric mucosal-adherent microbes in healthy human subjects.Twelve healthy individuals were divided into three groups; experimental group, control group one, and control group two. Subjects in the experimental group underwent an un-prepped flexible sigmoidoscopy with biopsies. Within two weeks, subjects were given a standard polyethylene glycol-based bowel cleansing preparation followed by a second flexible sigmoidoscopy. Subjects in control group one underwent two un-prepped flexible sigmoidoscopies within one week. Subjects in the second control group underwent an un-prepped flexible sigmoidoscopy followed by a second flexible sigmoidoscopy after a 24-hour clear liquid diet within one week. The mucosa-associated microbial communities from the two procedures in each subject were compared using 16S rRNA gene based terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP), and library cloning and sequencing.Clone library sequencing analysis showed that there were changes in the composition of the mucosa-associated microbiota in subjects after colonic lavage. These changes were not observed in our control groups. Standard bowel preparation altered the diversity of mucosa-associated microbiota. Taxonomic classification did not reveal significant changes at the phylum level, but there were differences observed at the genus level.Standard bowel cleansing preparation altered the mucosal-adherent microbiota in all of our subjects, although the degree of change was variable. These findings underscore the importance of considering the confounding effects of bowel preparation when designing experiments exploring the gut microbiota."
https://openalex.org/W2032551913,"Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease that comprises multiple subtypes. Luminal subtype tumors confer a more favorable patient prognosis, which is, in part, attributed to estrogen receptor (ER)-α positivity and antihormone responsiveness. Expression of the forkhead box transcription factor, FOXA1, similarly correlates with the luminal subtype and patient survival, but is also present in a subset of ER-negative tumors. FOXA1 is also consistently expressed in luminal breast cancer cell lines even in the absence of ER. In contrast, breast cancer cell lines representing the basal subtype do not express FOXA1. To delineate an ER-independent role for FOXA1 in maintaining the luminal phenotype, and hence a more favorable prognosis, we performed expression microarray analyses on FOXA1-positive and ER-positive (MCF7, T47D), or FOXA1-positive and ER-negative (MDA-MB-453, SKBR3) luminal cell lines in the presence or absence of transient FOXA1 silencing. This resulted in three FOXA1 transcriptomes: (1) a luminal signature (consistent across cell lines), (2) an ER-positive signature (restricted to MCF7 and T47D) and (3) an ER-negative signature (restricted to MDA-MB-453 and SKBR3). Gene set enrichment analyses revealed FOXA1 silencing causes a partial transcriptome shift from luminal to basal gene expression signatures. FOXA1 binds to a subset of both luminal and basal genes within luminal breast cancer cells, and loss of FOXA1 increases enhancer RNA transcription for a representative basal gene (CD58). These data suggest FOXA1 directly represses a subset of basal signature genes. Functionally, FOXA1 silencing increases migration and invasion of luminal cancer cells, both of which are characteristics of basal subtype cells. We conclude FOXA1 controls plasticity between basal and luminal breast cancer cells, not only by inducing luminal genes but also by repressing the basal phenotype, and thus aggressiveness. Although it has been proposed that FOXA1-targeting agents may be useful for treating luminal tumors, these data suggest that this approach may promote transitions toward more aggressive cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2062970569,"Despite the considerable number of studies reported to date, the causative agents of pneumonia are not completely identified. We comprehensively applied modern and traditional laboratory diagnostic techniques to identify microbiota in patients who were admitted to or developed pneumonia in intensive care units (ICUs). During a three-year period, we tested the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia, community-acquired pneumonia, non-ventilator ICU pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia, and compared the results with those from patients without pneumonia (controls). Samples were tested by amplification of 16S rDNA, 18S rDNA genes followed by cloning and sequencing and by PCR to target specific pathogens. We also included culture, amoeba co-culture, detection of antibodies to selected agents and urinary antigen tests. Based on molecular testing, we identified a wide repertoire of 160 bacterial species of which 73 have not been previously reported in pneumonia. Moreover, we found 37 putative new bacterial phylotypes with a 16S rDNA gene divergence ≥ 98% from known phylotypes. We also identified 24 fungal species of which 6 have not been previously reported in pneumonia and 7 viruses. Patients can present up to 16 different microorganisms in a single BAL (mean ± SD; 3.77 ± 2.93). Some pathogens considered to be typical for ICU pneumonia such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus species can be detected as commonly in controls as in pneumonia patients which strikingly highlights the existence of a core pulmonary microbiota. Differences in the microbiota of different forms of pneumonia were documented."
https://openalex.org/W2072211192,"Angiogenesis is controlled positively or negatively by extrinsic and intrinsic molecular cues in endothelial cells (ECs); in the tumor microenvironment, the action of positive regulators exceeds that of negative regulators. Thus, overinduction of negative regulators may inhibit tumor angiogenesis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) are endogenous short noncoding RNAs regulating gene expression either through translational inhibition or destabilization of target mRNA. Here, we show that miR-125b expression is transiently induced in ECs on stimulation with vascular endothelial growth factor or by ischemia. miR-125b inhibits translation of vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin mRNA and in vitro tube formation by ECs. Injection of miR-125b into the tumor inhibited VE-cadherin expression by ECs and induced nonfunctional blood vessel formation, resulting in inhibition of tumor growth. It has been suggested that pro-angiogenic signals in ECs also upregulate anti-angiogenic molecules simultaneously via negative feedback. Because miR-125b induction in ECs is transient after pro-angiogenic stimulation, prolonged overexpression of miR-125b could result in blood vessel regression. Thus, miR-125b may be useful in cancer therapy by causing the collapse of the lumen of ECs."
https://openalex.org/W2156432877,"Previous studies have indicated that female animals are more resistant to carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver fibrosis than male animals, and that estradiol (E2) treatment can inhibit CCl4-induced animal hepatic fibrosis. The underlying mechanism governing these phenomena, however, has not been fully elucidated. Here we reported the role of estrogen-induced miRNA-29 (miR-29) expression in CCl4-induced mouse liver injury. Hepatic miR-29 levels were differentially regulated in female and male mice during CCl4 treatment. Specifically, the levels of miR-29a and miR-29b expression were significantly decreased in the livers of male, but not female, mice following 4 weeks of CCl4 treatment. The down-regulation of miR-29a and miR-29b in male mouse livers correlated with the early development of liver fibrosis, as indicated by increased expressions of fibrotic markers in male mice relative to female mice. In addition, E2 was maintained at a higher level in female mice than in male mice. In contrast to TGF-β1 that decreased miR-29a/b expression in murine hepatoma IAR20 cells and normal hepatocytes, E2 enhanced the expression of miR-29a/b through suppression of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signal pathway, which negatively regulates miR-29 expression. Furthermore, both E2 treatment and intravenous injection of the recombinant adenovirus expressing miR-29a/b markedly increased the miR-29a/b level and attenuated the expression of fibrotic markers in mouse livers during CCl4 treatment, supporting the protective role of E2-induced miR-29 in CCl4-induced hepatic injury. In conclusion, our results collectively demonstrate that estrogen can inhibit CCl4-induced hepatic injury through the induction of hepatic miR-29.

https://openalex.org/W2023633969,"PH domain leucine-rich-repeats protein phosphatase (PHLPP) is a family of Ser/Thr protein phosphatases that serve as tumor suppressors by negatively regulating Akt. Our recent studies have demonstrated that the ubiquitin proteasome pathway has an important role in the downregulation of PHLPP in colorectal cancer. In this study, we show that the deubiquitinase USP46 stabilizes the expression of both PHLPP isoforms by reducing the rate of PHLPP degradation. USP46 binds to PHLPP and directly removes the polyubiquitin chains from PHLPP in vitro and in cells. Increased USP46 expression correlates with decreased ubiquitination and upregulation of PHLPP proteins in colon cancer cells, whereas knockdown of USP46 has the opposite effect. Functionally, USP46-mediated stabilization of PHLPP and the subsequent inhibition of Akt result in a decrease in cell proliferation and tumorigenesis of colon cancer cells in vivo. Moreover, reduced USP46 protein level is found associated with poor PHLPP expression in colorectal cancer patient specimens. Taken together, these results indentify a tumor suppressor role of USP46 in promoting PHLPP expression and inhibiting Akt signaling in colon cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2135293820,"Therapeutic angiogenesis by delivery of vascular growth factors is an attractive strategy for treating debilitating occlusive vascular diseases, yet clinical trials have thus far failed to show efficacy. As a result, limb amputation remains a common outcome for muscle ischemia due to severe atherosclerotic disease, with an overall incidence of 100 per million people in the United States per year. A challenge has been that the angiogenic master regulator vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induces dysfunctional vessels, if expressed outside of a narrow dosage window. We tested the hypothesis that codelivery of platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), which recruits pericytes, could induce normal angiogenesis in skeletal muscle irrespective of VEGF levels. Coexpression of VEGF and PDGF-BB encoded by separate vectors in different cells or in the same cells only partially corrected aberrant angiogenesis. In marked contrast, coexpression of both factors in every cell at a fixed relative level via a single bicistronic vector led to robust, uniformly normal angiogenesis, even when VEGF expression was high and heterogeneous. Notably, in an ischemic hindlimb model, single-vector expression led to efficient growth of collateral arteries, revascularization, increased blood flow, and reduced tissue damage. Furthermore, these results were confirmed in a clinically applicable gene therapy approach by adenoviral-mediated delivery of the bicistronic vector. We conclude that coordinated expression of VEGF and PDGF-BB via a single vector constitutes a novel strategy for harnessing the potency of VEGF to induce safe and efficacious angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2016426158,"There are few effective treatments for metastatic melanoma. Checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) inhibitors are being trialled for their efficacy in enhancing conventional chemotherapeutic agents, but their effectiveness as single agents is not known. We have examined the effectiveness of two novel Chk1 selective inhibitors, AR323 and AR678, in a panel of melanoma cell lines and normal cell types. We demonstrate that these drugs display single-agent activity, with IC50s in the low nanomolar range. The drugs produce cytotoxic effects in cell lines that are most sensitive to these drugs, whereas normal cells are only sensitive to these drugs at the higher concentrations where they have cytostatic activity. The cytotoxic effect is the consequence of inhibition of S-phase Chk1, which drives cells prematurely from late S phase into an aberrant mitosis and results in either failure of cytokinesis or cell death through an apoptotic mechanism. The sensitivity to the Chk1 inhibitors was correlated with the level of endogenous DNA damage indicating replicative stress. Chk1 inhibitors are viable single-agent therapies that target melanoma cells with high levels of endogenous DNA damage. This sensitivity suggests that Chk1 is a critical component of an adaptation to replicative stress in these cells. It also suggests that markers of DNA damage may be useful in identifying the melanomas and potentially other tumour types that are more likely to be sensitive to Chk1 inhibitors as single agents."
https://openalex.org/W2110191141,"Anti-inflammatory signals play an essential role in constraining the magnitude of an inflammatory response. Extracellular adenosine is a critical tissue-protective factor, limiting the extent of inflammation. Given the potent anti-inflammatory effects of extracellular adenosine, we sought to investigate how extracellular adenosine regulates T cell activation and differentiation. Adenosine receptor activation by a pan adenosine-receptor agonist enhanced the abundance of murine regulatory T cells (Tregs), a cell type critical in constraining inflammation. Gene expression studies in both naïve CD4 T cells and Tregs revealed that these cells expressed multiple adenosine receptors. Based on recent studies implicating the Adora2b in endogenous anti-inflammatory responses during acute inflammation, we used a pharmacologic approach to specifically activate Adora2b. Indeed, these studies revealed robust enhancement of Treg differentiation in wild-type mice, but not in Adora2b(-/-) T cells. Finally, when we subjected Adora2b-deficient mice to endotoxin-induced pulmonary inflammation, we found that these mice experienced more severe inflammation, characterized by increased cell recruitment and increased fluid leakage into the airways. Notably, Adora2b-deficient mice failed to induce Tregs after endotoxin-induced inflammation and instead had an enhanced recruitment of pro-inflammatory effector T cells. In total, these data indicate that the Adora2b adenosine receptor serves a potent anti-inflammatory role, functioning at least in part through the enhancement of Tregs, to limit inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W1998331174,"Background Preclinical studies strongly suggest that accelerated apoptosis in skeletal myocytes may be involved in the pathogenesis of sarcopenia. However, evidence in humans is sparse. In the present study, we investigated whether apoptotic signaling in the skeletal muscle was associated with indices of muscle mass and function in older persons. Methodology/Principal Findings Community-dwelling older adults were categorized into high-functioning (HF) or low-functioning (LF) groups according to their short physical performance battery (SPPB) summary score. Participants underwent an isokinetic knee extensor strength test and 3-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging of the thigh. Vastus lateralis muscle samples were obtained by percutaneous needle biopsy and assayed for the expression of a set of apoptotic signaling proteins. Age, sex, number of comorbid conditions and medications as well as knee extensor strength were not different between groups. HF participants displayed greater thigh muscle volume compared with LF persons. Multivariate partial least squares (PLS) regressions showed significant correlations between caspase-dependent apoptotic signaling proteins and the muscular percentage of thigh volume (R2 = 0.78; Q2 = 0.61) as well as gait speed (R2 = 0.81; Q2 = 0.56). Significant variables in the PLS model of percent muscle volume were active caspase-8, cleaved caspase-3, cytosolic cytochrome c and mitochondrial Bak. The regression model of gait speed was mainly described by cleaved caspase-3 and mitochondrial Bax and Bak. PLS predictive apoptotic variables did not differ between functional groups. No correlation was determined between apoptotic signaling proteins and muscle strength or quality (strength per unit volume). Conclusions/Significance Data from this exploratory study show for the first time that apoptotic signaling is correlated with indices of muscle mass and function in a cohort of community-dwelling older persons. Future larger-scale studies are needed to corroborate these preliminary findings and determine if down-regulation of apoptotic signaling in skeletal myocytes will provide improvements in the muscle mass and functional status of older persons."
https://openalex.org/W2060357319,"Background Diapause, a condition of developmental arrest and metabolic depression exhibited by a wide range of animals is accompanied by complex physiological and biochemical changes that generally enhance environmental stress tolerance and synchronize reproduction. Even though some aspects of diapause have been well characterized, very little is known about the full range of molecular and biochemical modifications underlying diapause in non-model organisms. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study we focused on the parasitic wasp, Praon volucre that exhibits a pupal diapause in response to environmental signals. System-wide metabolic changes occurring during diapause were investigated using GC-MS metabolic fingerprinting. Moreover, proteomic changes were studied in diapausing versus non-diapausing phenotypes using a combination of two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and mass spectrometry. We found a reduction of Krebs cycle intermediates which most likely resulted from the metabolic depression. Glycolysis was galvanized, probably to favor polyols biosynthesis. Diapausing parasitoids accumulated high levels of cryoprotective polyols, especially sorbitol. A large set of proteins were modulated during diapause and these were involved in various functions such as remodeling of cytoskeleton and cuticle, stress tolerance, protein turnover, lipid metabolism and various metabolic enzymes. Conclusions/Significance The results presented here provide some first clues about the molecular and biochemical events that characterize the diapause syndrome in aphid parasitoids. These data are useful for probing potential commonality of parasitoids diapause with other taxa and they will help creating a general understanding of diapause underpinnings and a background for future interpretations."

A unique feature of Hcp and another commonly observed secreted extracellular protein (or exoprotein), VgrG (valine-glycine repeat protein G), is that they both lack a recognizable Sec- or Tat-dependent signal peptide and are an integral part of the secretion apparatus because of their mutual requirement for secretion (18Pukatzki S.

Moreover, two of the Vibrio cholerae T6SS components, TssB (VipA) and TssC (VipB), following the general type VI secretion (Tss) nomenclature (25Shalom G. Shaw J.G. Thomas M.S.

Mogk A. Tubules and donuts: a type VI secretion story.Mol. Microbiol. 2010; 76: 815-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In addition, T6SS also encodes components with sequence similarity to T4 phage gp25, a baseplate protein with lysozyme activity (23Leiman P.G. Basler M. Ramagopal U.A. Bonanno J.B. Sauder J.M. Pukatzki S. Burley S.K. Almo S.C. Mekalanos J.J. Type VI secretion apparatus and phage tail-associated protein complexes share a common evolutionary origin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Structure-function analysis of HsiF, a gp25-like component of the type VI secretion system, in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Microbiology. 2011; 157: 3292-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is conceivable that T6SS may assemble into an inverted phage tail-like surface appendage similar to the T3S needle or T4S pilus (29Hayes C.S. Aoki S.K. Low D.A. Bacterial contact-dependent delivery systems.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2010; 44: 71-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). However, whether and how this postulated structure is assembled in vivo and the molecular mechanisms underlying Hcp/VgrG secretion across double membranes remain largely unknown. Bacterial secretion systems generally require ATPases or proton motive force to energize assembly of the secretion machinery and/or substrate translocation (30Shiue S.J. Kao K.M. Leu W.M. Chen L.Y.

In T6SSs, two proteins with known ATPase activity or nucleotide binding site may function as energizers. The AAA+-type ATPase TssH (ClpV) mediates the remodeling of cogwheel-like TssB/TssC (VipA/VipB) tubules via ATP hydrolysis, which is crucial for Hcp secretion (26Bönemann G. Pietrosiuk A. Diemand A.

The IcmF family protein TssM is a conserved T6SS component and putative NTPase in which the importance of its Walker A nucleotide binding site for Hcp secretion remains controversial (20Zheng J. Leung K.Y. Dissection of a type VI secretion system in Edwardsiella tarda.Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 66: 1192-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 36Ma L.S. Lin J.S. Lai E.M. An IcmF family protein, ImpLM, is an integral inner membrane protein interacting with ImpKL, and its walker a motif is required for type VI secretion system-mediated Hcp secretion in Agrobacterium tumefaciens.J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 4316-4329Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). TssM is a polytopic IM protein interacting with another conserved T6SS protein, TssL, a bitopic IcmH/DotU family IM protein, to form an IM protein complex (36Ma L.S. Lin J.S. Lai E.M. An IcmF family protein, ImpLM, is an integral inner membrane protein interacting with ImpKL, and its walker a motif is required for type VI secretion system-mediated Hcp secretion in Agrobacterium tumefaciens.J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 4316-4329Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, the functional role of TssM and TssL in Hcp secretion remains unclear. Here, we have characterized the biochemical functions of TssM and its interacting protein, TssL, for their mechanistic roles in Hcp secretion in T6SS of the plant pathogenic bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens. We provide compelling evidence that TssM exhibits ATPase activity and its ATP hydrolysis but not ATP binding activity is crucial for assembly of TssM-TssL-Hcp IM complex and energizes the secretion of Hcp from A. tumefaciens. The direct interaction of Hcp with the periplasmic domain of TssL further suggested that TssM might function as an energizer to trigger periplasmic Hcp secretion across the OM. Table 1 lists all of the strains and plasmids used in this study. The primers used are listed in supplemental Table S1.

For plasmids used in protein purification, the plasmid pET-TssM-His was created by ligating the NdeI/XhoI-digested tssM PCR product (primers 1 and 2) into the same site of pET22b-(+). To construct plasmid pET-TssMG144A/K145A-His or pET-TssM4PM-His, the 1.5-kb NdeI/BamHI-digested tssM fragment from the plasmid pET-TssM-His was removed and replaced with the 1.5-kb NdeI/BamHI-digested tssM PCR product containing either the G144A/K145A mutation (primers 3a and 3b and primers 4a and 4b) or the G139A/G144A/K145A/T146A mutation (primers 5a and 5b and primers 6a and 6b), respectively. For plasmid pACYC-TssL-TssM-His, the tssL PCR product (primers 7a and 7b) was cloned into the NcoI/EcoRI sites of pACYCDUET-1 to create plasmid pACYC-TssL. The tssM PCR product (primers 8a and 8b) was cloned into the NdeI/XhoI sites of pACYC-TssL resulting in pACYC-TssL-TssM-His. The plasmids pACYC-TssL-TssMG144A/K145A-His (primers 3a and 3b and primers 4a and 4b) and pACYC-TssL-TssMD188A/G191A-His (primers 9a and 9b and primers 10a and 10b) were constructed following the procedure described for construction of pET-TssMG144A/K145A-His. For plasmid pTssL, the tssL ORF was amplified (primers 21 and 22) and cloned into the NcoI/BamHI sites of pTrc200. For plasmids used in complementation or protein-protein interaction, the plasmid pTssMD188A/G191A was created by replacing the 1.5-kb XhoI/BamHI-digested tssM fragment of plasmid pRL662-TssM (36Ma L.S.

Then, the plasmid pTrc-TssL(Cyto)-HA was used as a template for amplifying the tssL(Cyto)-HA PCR product (primers 17 and 18). The PCR product was digested with NdeI/HindIII and ligated into the same site of pET22b-(+) to result in plasmid pET-TssL(Cyto)-HA.

The plasmids used in co-expressing WT TssM or its variants with TssL are indicated in each experiment. The strains were grown in Luria broth medium at 30 °C till A600 = 0.6. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and growth continued for 4 h at 25 °C. The cells were suspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.3 m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 1 mm PMSF, and 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme) supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml DNase and 0.1 mg/ml RNase. After two passages through a French pressure cell at 16,000 p.s.i., the unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellet, enriched with membrane proteins, was incubated in extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, and 2% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DDM)) overnight and centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 1 h to obtain the supernatant containing the DDM-soluble membrane proteins. The DDM-solubilized proteins were further adjusted to final buffer condition (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.3 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% DDM, and 10 mm imidazole) before preincubation with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) resin for 1 h. The precleared protein sample was loaded onto an NTA column, washed with washing buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.05% DDM, and 15 mm imidazole), and eluted with elution buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.05 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.05% DDM, and 200 mm imidazole). The eluted fractions were concentrated and exchanged to a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.05 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.05% DDM using either 100-kDa Microcon cut-offs (Millipore YM-100) for WT TssM and its variants or 30-kDa Microcon cut-offs for negative control TssL-His. The purified WT TssM and its variants were kept on ice until ATP binding or the ATPase activity assay within 3 days after purification to avoid protein degradation and loss of activity. The TssM nucleotide binding activity was determined using a fluorescent ATP analog (TNP-ATP; Molecular Probes, Inc.) monitored by a Jasco FP-6500 spectrofluorometer. Purified TssM proteins were resuspended at 0.25 μm in reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.05 m NaCl, 0.05% DDM) in the presence or absence of 2 μm TNP-ATP and incubated at room temperature for 1 min. Fluorescence was excited at 410 nm, and emission was scanned in the range of 470 to 650 nm. All spectra were corrected by subtracting the background fluorescence emitted from buffer control.

Methods From 1994 to 2008, liver biopsy was performed on 319 treatment-naïve CHB patients. Histologic assessment was based on the Knodell histologic activity index for necroinflammation and the Ishak fibrosis staging for fibrosis. Results 211 HBeAg-positive and 108 HBeAg-negative patients were recruited, with a median age of 31 and 46 years respectively. 9 out of 40 (22.5%) HBeAg-positive patients with normal ALT had significant histologic abnormalities (necroinflammation grading ≥7 or fibrosis score ≥3). There was a significant difference in fibrosis scores among HBeAg-positive patients with an ALT level within the Prati criteria (30 U/L for men, 19 U/L for women) and patients with a normal ALT but exceeding the Prati criteria (p = 0.024). Age, aspartate aminotransferase and platelet count were independent predictors of significant fibrosis in HBeAg-positive patients with an elevated ALT by multivariate analysis (p = 0.007, 0.047 and 0.045 respectively). HBV DNA and platelet count were predictors of significant fibrosis in HBeAg-negative disease (p = 0.020 and 0.015 respectively). An elevated ALT was not predictive of significant fibrosis for HBeAg-positive (p = 0.345) and -negative (p = 0.544) disease. There was no significant difference in fibrosis staging among ALT 1–2×upper limit of normal (ULN) and >×2 ULN for both HBeAg-positive (p = 0.098) and -negative (p = 0.838) disease. Conclusion An elevated ALT does not accurately predict significant liver injury. Decisions on commencing antiviral therapy should not be heavily based on a particular ALT threshold."

Global PTP1B deletion improves diet-induced obesity and glucose homeostasis via enhanced leptin signaling in the brain and increased insulin signaling in liver and muscle. However, the role of PTP1B in adipocytes is unclear, with studies demonstrating beneficial, detrimental or no effect(s) of adipose-PTP1B-deficiency on body mass and insulin resistance. To definitively establish the role of adipocyte-PTP1B in body mass regulation and glucose homeostasis, adipocyte-specific-PTP1B knockout mice (adip-crePTP1B(-/-)) were generated using the adiponectin-promoter to drive Cre-recombinase expression. Chow-fed adip-crePTP1B(-/-) mice display enlarged adipocytes, despite having similar body weight/adiposity and glucose homeostasis compared to controls. High-fat diet (HFD)-fed adip-crePTP1B(-/-) mice display no differences in body weight/adiposity but exhibit larger adipocytes, increased circulating glucose and leptin levels, reduced leptin sensitivity and increased basal lipogenesis compared to controls. This is associated with decreased insulin receptor (IR) and Akt/PKB phosphorylation, increased lipogenic gene expression and increased hypoxia-induced factor-1-alpha (Hif-1α) expression. Adipocyte-specific PTP1B deletion does not beneficially manipulate signaling pathways regulating glucose homeostasis, lipid metabolism or adipokine secretion in adipocytes.

This study was designed to examine the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of SM934, a water-soluble artemisinin analogue, on lupus-prone female NZB × NZW F(1) mice.NZB/W F(1) mice were treated orally with SM934 for 3 or 6 months respectively to investigate the effect on clinical manifestations and immunological correlates. To further explore the mechanisms of SM934, ovalbumin (OVA)-immunized or interferon (IFN)-γ-elicited C57BL/6 mice were used. In vivo, treatment with SM934 for 3 or 6 months significantly delayed the progression of glomerulonephritis and increased the survival rate of NZB/W F(1) mice. Clinical improvement was accompanied with decreased Th1-related anti-double-strand DNA (dsDNA) IgG2a and IgG3 Abs, serum interleukin (IL)-17, and increased Th2-related anti-dsDNA IgG1 Ab, serum IL-10 and IL-4. SM934 treatment also suppressed the accumulation of effector/memory T cells, induced the apoptosis of CD4(+) T cells, while enhancing the development of regulatory T cells in NZB/W F(1) mice. In addition, SM934 treatment promoted the IL-10 production of macrophages from NZB/W F(1) mice, OVA-immunized C57BL/6 mice and IFN-γ-elicited C57BL/6 mice. In vitro, SM934 enhanced IL-10 production from primary macrophages stimulated with IFN-γ.The results of this study demonstrated that artemisinin analogue SM934 had therapeutic effects on lupus-prone female NZB/W F(1) mice by inhibiting the pathogenic helper T cell development and enhancing anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 production."
https://openalex.org/W2085067883,"Background We aimed to evaluate the incidence of type 1 diabetes mellitus in children <15 years of age (yr) in the Auckland region (New Zealand) over 20 years (1990–2009). Methods We performed a retrospective review of all patients <15 yr diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, from an unselected complete regional cohort. Results There were 884 new cases of type 1 diabetes, and age at diagnosis rose from 7.6 yr in 1990/1 to 8.9 yr in 2008/9 (r2 = 0.31, p = 0.009). There was a progressive increase in type 1 diabetes incidence among children <15 yr (p<0.0001), reaching 22.5 per 100,000 in 2009. However, the rise in incidence did not occur evenly among age groups, being 2.5-fold higher in older children (10–14 yr) than in the youngest group (0–4 yr). The incidence of new cases of type 1 diabetes was highest in New Zealand Europeans throughout the study period in all age groups (p<0.0001), but the rate of increase was similar in New Zealand Europeans and Non-Europeans. Type 1 diabetes incidence and average annual increase were similar in both sexes. There was no change in BMI SDS shortly after diagnosis, and no association between BMI SDS and age at diagnosis. Conclusions There has been a steady increase in type 1 diabetes incidence among children <15 yr in Auckland over 20 years. Contrary to other studies, age at diagnosis has increased and the greatest rise in incidence occurred in children 10–14 yr. There was little change in BMI SDS in this population, providing no support for the ‘accelerator hypothesis’."
https://openalex.org/W2158244671,"Despite their apparent success in pre-clinical trials, metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitors proved to be inefficacious in clinical settings. In an effort to understand the underlying causes of this unanticipated outcome, we modeled the consequences of long-term MMP inhibition by removing one of the major players in tumorigenesis, MMP9, in two complimentary mouse models of pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinogenesis: Myc;BclXl and RIP1-Tag2. By employing gel zymography and a fluoregenic solution assay, we first established that MMP9 is expressed and activated in Myc;BclXl tumors in an interleukin-1β-dependent manner. The genetic deletion of MMP9 in Myc;BclXl mice impairs tumor angiogenesis and growth analogous to its absence in the RIP1-Tag2 model. Notably, tumors that developed in the context of MMP9-deficient backgrounds in both models were markedly more invasive than their typical wild-type counterparts, and expressed elevated levels of pro-invasive cysteine cathepsin B. The increased invasion of MMP9-deficient tumors was associated with a switch in the spectrum of inflammatory cells at the tumor margins, involving homing of previously undetected, cathepsin-B expressing CD11b;Gr1-positive cells to the invasive fronts. Thus, plasticity in the tumor inflammatory compartment is partially responsible for changes in the expression pattern of tumor-associated proteases, and may contribute to the compensatory effects observed on MMP inhibition, hence accounting for the heightened tumor progression described in late stage clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W2006025022,"Human macrophages at mucosal sites are essential targets for acute HIV infection. During the chronic phase of infection, they are persistent reservoirs for the AIDS virus. HIV virions gain entry into macrophages following ligation of surface CD4-CCR5 co-receptors, which leads to the release of two copies of HIV ssRNA. These events lead to reverse transcription and viral replication initiation. Toll-like receptors TLR7 and TLR8 recognize specific intracellular viral ssRNA sequences, but in human alveolar macrophages, their individual roles in TLR-mediated HIV ssRNA recognition are unclear. In the current study, HIV-1 ssRNA induced TNFα release in a dose-dependent manner in adherent human macrophages expressing both intracellular TLR7 and TLR8. This response was reduced by inhibiting either endocytosis (50 μm dynasore) or endosomal acidification (1 μg/ml chloroquine). Either MYD88 or TLR8 gene knockdown with relevant siRNA reduced HIV-1 ssRNA-mediated TNFα release, but silencing TLR7 had no effect on this response. Furthermore, HIV-1 ssRNA induced histone 4 acetylation at the TNFα promoter as well as trimethylation of histone 3 at lysine 4, whereas TLR8 gene knockdown reduced these effects. Taken together in human macrophages, TLR8 binds and internalizes HIV ssRNA, leading to endosomal acidification, chromatin remodeling, and increases in TNFα release. Drugs targeting macrophage TLR8-linked signaling pathways may modulate the innate immune response to acute HIV infection by reducing viral replication."

We also found that miR-3120 regulates important aspects of cellular function that are similar to that of its host gene, dynamin-3. miR-3120 was found to be located in neuronal cell bodies and to target Hsc70 and auxilin, and its lentivirus-mediated expression inhibited the uncoating of clathrin-coated vesicles.

https://openalex.org/W2127388402,"Class IA PI3K isoforms have divergent, nonredundant cell biological roles. In untransformed cells and tissues, p110a and p110β are ubiquitously expressed, whereas p110δ expression is highly enriched in leukocytes. High levels of p110δ expression have been documented in some solid tumor cell lines, but the functional role is unknown. This study aimed to elucidate the link between elevated expression of p110δ PI3K and cancer. We report that in breast and prostate cancer cells that contain leukocyte levels of p110δ, p110δ activity dampens the activity of the PTEN tumor suppressor. Indeed, inactivation of p110δ in these cells led to PTEN activation, suppression of Akt phosphorylation, and inhibition of cell proliferation, with inhibition of PTEN activity being able to counterbalance p110δ inactivation. Likewise, forced overexpression of p110δ in cells with low p110δ expression reduced PTEN activity, resulting in increased Akt phosphorylation. Our data indicate that the oncogenic potential of p110δ PI3K overexpression might at least partially act through PTEN inactivation, and that p110δ-selective PI3K inhibitors can have a dual antitumor mechanism, namely by directly inhibiting p110δ signaling and by a broader inhibition of class I PI3K activity through PTEN activation.

https://openalex.org/W2000121002,"Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) modulates a wide array of cellular processes, including embryonic development, cell differentiation, survival, and apoptosis. Recently, it was reported that a GSK-3 inhibitor attenuates lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced septic shock and regulates the mortality of endotoxemic mice. However, the detailed mechanism of reduced mortality via GSK-3 inhibition is not well defined. Herein, we showed that GSK-3 inhibition induces extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) activation under LPS-stressed conditions via protein kinase C δ (PKCδ) activation. Furthermore, PKCδ-induced ERK1/2 activation by the inhibition of GSK-3 provoked the production of interleukin (IL)-10, playing a crucial role in regulating endotoxemia. Using a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-1 (MEK-1) and PKCδ inhibitor, we confirmed that GSK-3 inhibition induces PKCδ and subsequent ERK1/2 activation, resulting in increased IL-10 expression under LPS-treated conditions. We verified that septic shock caused by LPS is attenuated by GSK-3 inhibition using a GSK-3 inhibitor. This relieved endotoxemia induced by GSK-3 inhibition was restored in an ERK1/2-dependent manner. Taken together, IL-10 expression produced by GSK-3 inhibition-induced ERK1/2 activation via PKCδ relieved LPS-mediated endotoxemia. This finding suggests that IL-10 hyperexpression resulting from GSK-3 inhibition-induced ERK activation could be a new therapeutic pathway for endotoxemia."
https://openalex.org/W2002242758,"Background Quantifying vigilance and exploring the underlying mechanisms has been the subject of numerous studies. Less attention has focused on the complex interplay between contributing factors such as reproductive status, social rank, sex and group size. Reproductive status and social rank are of particular interest due to their association with mating behavior. Mating activities in rutting season may interfere with typical patterns of vigilance and possibly interact with social rank. In addition, balancing the tradeoff between vigilance and life maintenance may represent a challenge for gregarious ungulate species rutting under harsh winter conditions. We studied vigilance patterns in the endangered Przewalski's gazelle (Procapra przewalskii) during both the rutting and non-rutting seasons to examine these issues. Methodology/Principal Findings Field observations were carried out with focal sampling during rutting and non-rutting season in 2008–2009. Results indicated a complex interplay between reproductive status, social rank, sex and group size in determining vigilance in this species. Vigilance decreased with group size in female but not in male gazelles. Males scanned more frequently and thus spent more time vigilant than females. Compared to non-rutting season, gazelles increased time spent scanning at the expense of bedding in rutting season. During the rutting season, territorial males spent a large proportion of time on rutting activities and were less vigilant than non-territorial males. Although territorial males may share collective risk detection with harem females, we suggest that they are probably more vulnerable to predation because they seemed reluctant to leave rut stands under threats. Conclusions/Significance Vigilance behavior in Przewalski's gazelle was significantly affected by reproductive status, social rank, sex, group size and their complex interactions. These findings shed light on the mechanisms underlying vigilance patterns and the tradeoff between vigilance and other crucial activities."

Although post-translational histone modifications are believed to have an important role in modulating transcriptional regulation of UVB-induced COX-2, the underlying biochemical mechanisms are completely unknown. Here, we show that UVB activates the p38 MAPK/MSK1 kinase cascade to phosphorylate histone H3 at Ser10 and Ser28, contributing to UVB-induced COX-2 expression. UVB has no effect on the global tri-methylation level of histone H3 (H3K4me3, H3K9me3, and H3K27me3). We observed that selected mammalian 14-3-3 proteins bind to UVB-induced phosphorylated histone H3 (Ser10 and Ser28). In particular, 14-3-3ɛ is critical for recruiting MSK1 and Cdk9 to the chromatin and subsequently phosphorylating the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II in the cox-2 promoter. We propose that histone H3 phosphorylation at Ser10 and Ser28 serve as critical switches to promote cox-2 gene expression by facilitating the recruitment of MSK1 and Cdk9 to the cox-2 promoter, thereby promoting RNA polymerase II phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2135640385,"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress activates the adaptive unfolded protein response, allowing cells to recover folding capacity in the organelle. However, the overwhelming response to severe damage results in apoptotic cell death. Because of the physical proximity between ER and mitochondria, a functional interrelationship between these two organelles, including mitochondrial ATP production and apoptosis, has been suggested. The adaptive response to ER stress includes the maintenance of cellular energetics, which eventually determines cell fate. We previously demonstrated that heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) activity protects cells against ER stress in a protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK)-dependent pathway. Here, we provide evidence that PERK-mediated induction of HO-1 in murine macrophages, RAW264.7, relays ER stress to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication and function. ER stress induced by thapsigargin treatments (10-100 nM) resulted in a 2-fold increase in mtDNA contents compared with that in the untreated control. HO-1 activity on ER stress is proven to be critical for mitochondrial integrity because chemical inhibition (zinc protoporphyrin, 5-20 μM) and genetic depletion of HO-1 by small interference RNA transfection suppress the activation of transcription factors for mitochondrial biogenesis. Carbon monoxide (CO), an enzymatic by-product of HO-1 activity is responsible for the function of HO-1. Limited bioavailability of CO by hemoglobin treatment triggers cell death with a concomitant decline in ATP production. Approximately 78.1% of RAW264.7 cells were damaged in the presence of hemoglobin compared with the percentage of injured cells (26.9%) under ER stress alone. Mitochondrial generation of ATP levels significantly declined when CO availability was limited under prolonged ER stress. Taken together, these results suggest that the cellular HO-1/CO system conveys ER stress to cell survival signals from mitochondria via both the activation of transcriptional factors and functional integrity of mtDNA.—Zheng, M., Kim, S.-K., Joe, Y., Back, S.

https://openalex.org/W2087358801,"In chronic myelogenous leukemia, the constitutive activation of the BCR-ABL kinase transforms cells to an addicted state that requires glucose metabolism for survival. We investigated S6K1, a protein kinase that drives glycolysis in leukemia cells, as a target for counteracting glucose-dependent survival induced by BCR-ABL. BCR-ABL potently activated S6K1-dependent signaling and glycolysis. Although S6K1 knockdown or rapamycin treatment suppressed glycolysis in BCR-ABL-transformed cells, these treatments did not induce cell death. Instead, loss of S6K1 triggered compensatory activation of fatty-acid oxidation, a metabolic program that can support glucose-independent cell survival. Fatty-acid oxidation in response to S6K1 inactivation required the expression of the fatty-acid transporter carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1c, which was recently linked to rapamycin resistance in cancer. Finally, addition of an inhibitor of fatty-acid oxidation significantly enhanced cytotoxicity in response to S6K1 inactivation. These data indicate that S6K1 dictates the metabolic requirements mediating BCR-ABL survival and provide a rationale for combining targeted inhibitors of signal transduction, with strategies to interrupt oncogene-induced metabolism."

This study demonstrates the novel function of human cathepsin V protease for producing the neuropeptides enkephalin and neuropeptide Y (NPY). Cathepsin V is a human-specific cysteine protease gene. Findings here show that expression of cathepsin V in neuroendocrine PC12 cells and human neuronal SK-N-MC cells results in production of (Met)enkephalin from proenkephalin. Gene silencing of cathepsin V by siRNA in human SK-N-MC cells results in reduction of (Met)enkephalin by more than 80%, illustrating the prominent role of cathepsin V for neuropeptide production. In vitro processing of proenkephalin by cathepsin V occurs at dibasic residue sites to generate enkephalin-containing peptides and an ∼24-kDa intermediate present in human brain. Cathepsin V is present in human brain cortex and hippocampus where enkephalin and NPY are produced and is present in purified human neuropeptide secretory vesicles. Colocalization of cathepsin V with enkephalin and NPY in secretory vesicles of human neuroblastoma cells was illustrated by confocal microscopy. Furthermore, expression of cathepsin V with proNPY results in NPY production.

Type 2 diabetes and obesity are often associated with insulin resistance that can be counteracted by exercise or the use of drugs increasing the relative proportion of oxidative fibers. RIP140 is a transcriptional coregulator with a central role in metabolic tissues and we tested the effect of modulating its level of expression on muscle glucose and lipid metabolism in two mice models. Here, we show that although RIP140 protein is expressed at the same level in both oxidative and glycolytic muscles, it inhibits both fatty acid and glucose utilization in a fiber-type dependent manner. In RIP140-null mice, fatty acid utilization increases in the extensor digitorum longus and this is associated with elevated expression of genes implicated in fatty acid binding and transport. In the RIP140-null soleus, depletion of RIP140 leads to increased GLUT4 trafficking and glucose uptake with no change in Akt activity. AMPK phosphorylation/activity is inhibited in the soleus of RIP140 transgenic mice and increased in RIP140-null soleus. This is associated with increased UCP1 expression and mitochondrial uncoupling revealing the existence of a signaling pathway controlling insulin-independent glucose uptake in the soleus of RIP140-null mice. In conclusion, our findings reinforce the participation of RIP140 in the maintenance of energy homeostasis by acting as an inhibitor of energy production and particularly point to RIP140 as a promising therapeutic target in the treatment of insulin resistance."

The present study localized their expression during kidney development. Kidneys from embryonic (E) 16-, 17-, 18-day-old mouse fetuses, and postnatal (P) 1-, 3-, 5-, 7-, 14-, 21-day-old pups were embedded in Epon.

The tracing was combined with a newly developed immunohistochemical technique, which enables immunohistochemistry on glutaraldehyde fixated plastic embedded sections. Thereby, the microstructure could be described in detail, and the immunochemistry can be performed using exactly the same sections. The study showed that Bcl-2 and Bax were strongly expressed in mature proximal convoluted tubules at all time points, less strongly expressed in proximal straight tubules, and only weakly in immature proximal tubules and distal tubules. No expression was detected in ureteric bud and other earlier developing structures, such as comma bodies, S shaped bodies, glomeruli, etc. Tubules expressing Bcl-2 only were occasionally observed. The present study showed that, during kidney development, Bcl-2 and Bax are expressed differently in the proximal and distal tubules, although these two tubule segments are almost equally equipped with mitochondria. The functional significance of the different expression of Bcl-2 and Bax in proximal and distal tubules is unknown. However, the findings of the present study suggest that the mitochondrial function differs between mature proximal tubules and in the rest of the tubules. The function of Bcl-2 and Bax during tubulogenesis still needs to be investigated."
https://openalex.org/W2164364327,"Inadvertent mammalian tissue exposures to low doses of ionizing radiation (IR) after radiation accidents, remediation of radioactive-contaminated areas, space travel or a dirty bomb represent an interesting trauma to an organism. Possible low-dose IR-induced bystander effects could impact our evaluation of human health effects, as cells within tissue are not equally damaged after doses of IR ⩽10 cGy. To understand tissue responses after low IR doses, we generated a reporter system using the human clusterin promoter fused to firefly luciferase (hCLUp-Luc). Secretory clusterin (sCLU), an extracellular molecular chaperone, induced by low doses of cytotoxic agents, clears cell debris. Low-dose IR (⩾2 cGy) exposure induced hCLUp-Luc activity with peak levels at 96 h, consistent with endogenous sCLU levels. As doses increased (⩾1 Gy), sCLU induction amplitudes increased and time-to-peak response decreased. sCLU expression was stimulated by insulin-like growth factor-1, but suppressed by p53. Responses in transgenic hCLUp-Luc reporter mice after low IR doses showed that specific tissues (that is, colon, spleen, mammary, thymus and bone marrow) of female mice induced hCLUp-Luc activity more than male mice after whole body (⩾10 cGy) irradiation. Tissue-specific, non-linear dose- and time-responses of hCLUp-Luc and endogenous sCLU levels were noted. Colon maintained homeostatic balance after 10 cGy. Bone marrow responded with delayed, but prolonged and elevated expression. Intraperitoneal administration of α-transforming growth factor (TGF)β1 (1D11), but not control (13C4) antibodies, immediately following IR exposure abrogated CLU induction responses. Induction in vivo also correlated with Smad signaling by activated TGFβ1 after IR. Mechanistically, media with elevated sCLU levels suppressed signaling, blocked apoptosis and increased survival of TGFβ1-exposed tumor or normal cells. Thus, sCLU is a pro-survival bystander factor that abrogates TGFβ1 signaling and most likely promotes wound healing."
https://openalex.org/W2010273911,"Plant secondary metabolites (SMs) are pervasive in animal foods and potentially influence feeding behavior, interspecies interactions, and the distribution and abundance of animals. Some of the major classes of naturally occurring SMs in plants include many water-soluble compounds in the molecular size range that could cross the intestinal epithelium via the paracellular space by diffusion or solvent drag. There are differences among species in paracellular permeability. Using Middle Eastern rodent and avian consumers of fruits containing SMs, we tested the hypothesis that avian species would have significantly higher paracellular permeability than rodent species. Permeability in intact animals was assessed using standard pharmacological methodology to measure absorption of two radiolabeled, inert, neutral water-soluble probes that do not interact with intestinal nutrient transporters, L-arabinose (Mr = 150.1 Da) and lactulose (Mr = 342.3 Da). We also measured absorption of labeled 3-O-methyl-D-glucose (3OMD-glucose; Mr = 194.2 Da), which is a nonmetabolized analogue of D-glucose that is passively absorbed through the paracellular space but also transported across the enterocyte membranes. Most glucose was absorbed by all species, but arabinose fractional absorption (f) was nearly three times higher in birds (1.03±0.17, n = 15 in two species) compared to rodents (0.37±0.06, n = 10 in two species) (P<0.001). Surprisingly, the apparent rates of absorption in birds of arabinose exceeded those of 3OMD-glucose. Our findings are in agreement with previous work showing that the paracellular pathway is more prominent in birds relative to nonflying mammals, and suggests that birds may be challenged by greater absorption of water-soluble, dietary SMs. The increased expression of the paracellular pathway in birds hints at a tradeoff: the free energy birds gain by absorbing water-soluble nutrients passively may be offset by the metabolic demands placed on them to eliminate concomitantly absorbed SMs."

As the fatty acids released include arachidonic acid, PLA2 has a critical role during immune responses through generation of the precursors of the eicosanoids, including the leukotrienes, prostaglandins, and thromboxanes, which are potent inflammatory mediators (3.Funk C.D.

The PLA2 family includes several relatively unrelated proteins, among which are the following: the low molecular weight secreted enzymes (sPLA2s), which have been implicated in eicosanoid generation, inflammation, host defense, and atherosclerosis (5.Boyanovsky B.B. Webb N.R. Biology of secretory phospholipase A2.Cardiovasc. Drugs Ther. 2009; 23: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar); the cytosolic Ca2+-independent group VI PLA2s, which have been reported to have roles in phospholipid homeostasis and membrane remodeling (6.Balsinde J.

Inhibition of calcium-independent phospholipase A2 prevents arachidonic acid incorporation and phospholipid remodeling in P388D1 macrophages.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 8527-8531Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar); and the group IV cytosolic PLA2s, which include six high molecular mass enzymes in Mus musculus (as PLA2IVα to PLA2IVζ), with three newly cloned isoforms (7.Ohto T.

PLA2IVα has an essential role in initiation of the arachidonate pathway, and it is mainly involved in inflammation, intestinal ulceration, acute lung injury, anaphylaxis, and parturition, as shown through the PLA2IVα knock-out mouse approach (8.Bonventre J.V.

Roles for cytosolic phospholipase A2α as revealed by gene-targeted mice.Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2002; 68: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). PLA2IVα activity requires up to micromolar concentrations of intracellular Ca2+ to promote the binding of two calcium ions to its N-terminal C2 domain, thus inducing a conformational change and translocation of PLA2IVα from the cytosol to the cell membranes, where it can then access its substrates (11.Hirabayashi T. Murayama T. Shimizu T. Regulatory mechanism and physiological role of cytosolic phospholipase A2.Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2004; 27: 1168-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The initial theory of PLA2IVα membrane translocation was based on hydrophobic interactions of its C2 domain with phosphatidylcholine-enriched membranes in response to an intracellular Ca2+ increase (12.Perisic O. Paterson H.F. Mosedale G. Lara-González S. Williams R.L. Mapping the phospholipid-binding surface and translocation determinants of the C2 domain from cytosolic phospholipase A2.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14979-14987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, this has been revised through more recent studies that have shown that the cationic β-groove of the C2 domain can bind to ceramide 1-phosphate on internal membranes (13.Stahelin R.V. Subramanian P. Vora M. Cho W. Chalfant C.E. Ceramide-1-phosphate binds group IVA cytosolic phospholipase A2 via a novel site in the C2 domain.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20467-20474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the cationic cluster of the PLA2IVα catalytic domain (Lys-488, Lys-541, Lys-543, and Lys-544) can bind to anionic phospholipids, although the requirement for this interaction for membrane translocation or regulation of enzymatic activity is still under debate (14.Casas J.

The majority of these studies have documented translocation of PLA2IVα to internal cell membranes, such as the nuclear envelope, Golgi complex, and endoplasmic reticulum, whereby PLA2IVα contributes to the structure and function of these cell compartments (16.Brown W.J.

Serine phosphorylation on PLA2IVα (Ser-505 or Ser-727) is mediated mainly by the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) ERK1/2, and by the stress kinases p38 and JNK, and this has been shown to increase the intrinsic enzymatic activity of PLA2IVα (23.Kudo I. Murakami M. Phospholipase A2 enzymes.Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2002; 68: 3-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 24.Mariggiò S. Sebastià J. Filippi B.M. Iurisci C. Volonté C.

In addition, although phosphatidylcholine is generally considered to be the PLA2IVα substrate (25.Nalefski E.A. McDonagh T. Somers W. Seehra J. Falke J.J. Clark J.D.

Regulation of arachidonic acid availability for eicosanoid production.Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 82: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Indeed, PLA2IVα has been shown to be the specific enzyme that produces glycerophosphoinositols from the membrane phosphoinositides upon hormonal stimulation and oncogenic transformation (24.Mariggiò S.

The PLA2s have been reported to participate in immune cell functions also through the regulation of phagocytosis, as initiated by interactions of ligand-coated particles (particles opsonized with immunoglobulins or complement) with specific receptors expressed on the surface of phagocytic cells (Fc receptors (FcRs) or complement receptors) (29.Underhill D.M. Ozinsky A. Phagocytosis of microbes. Complexity in action.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 825-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). Phagocytosis induces recruitment of a variety of signaling enzymes and adaptor proteins to the site of particle ingestion, thus resulting in a multifactorial process that triggers the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and internalization of the bound particles (30.May R.C. Machesky L.M. Phagocytosis and the actin cytoskeleton.J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1061-1077Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, as well as PLA2 involvement, the signaling pathway activated during phagocytosis varies according to cell type, the nature of the stimulus, the number and type of receptors involved, and the ability of certain microorganisms to subvert the phagocytic process (19.Girotti M.

Here, we demonstrate that among the early events of macrophage activation triggered by FcR-mediated phagocytosis, there is the selective activation of PLA2IVα, which is shown to translocate to the site of nascent phagosomes and to participate directly in the modulation of the phagocytic process, independent of its enzymatic activity.

The activation status of ERK1/2, p38, and JNK was determined as described previously (40.Brondello J.M. Brunet A. Pouysségur J. McKenzie F.R.

For stimulation by FcR-mediated phagocytosis, after overnight labeling, the cells were incubated for a further 2 h in serum-free DMEM plus 0.25 μCi/ml [3H]arachidonic acid or 10 μCi/ml myo-[3H]inositol, then washed twice, and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C, without or with RIgG-opsonized latex beads, before transfer to 37 °C for the 30-min phagocytosis step. In unstimulated cells, across the full experimental data, the total [3H]arachidonic acid-containing lipid levels were 321,319 ± 43,723 cpm/well for the phagocytosis and 221,558 ± 24,525 cpm/well for LPS stimulation. The amounts of [3H]GroPIns were expressed as percentages of the total water-soluble cellular radioactivity (42.Berrie C.P. Iurisci C. Piccolo E. Bagnati R. Corda D. Analysis of phosphoinositides and their aqueous metabolites.Methods Enzymol. 2007; 434: 187-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and in unstimulated cells, the total [3H]inositol-containing aqueous compounds were 43,762 ± 7,774 cpm/well for the phagocytosis, and 72,994 ± 19,132 cpm/well for LPS stimulation. Three μm latex beads were opsonized with 1 mg/ml rabbit IgG for 2 h at 37 °C in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then with 5 ng of Alexa546- or Alexa488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgGs for a further 1 h; excess IgGs were extensively washed out with PBS, and the beads were resuspended in DMEM. The cells were serum-starved for 2 h and preincubated or not for 15 min with the inhibitors. The opsonized beads (100 beads/cell) or Texas Red-zymosan A particles (100 particles/cell) were then added to the cells, incubated for 30 min at 4 °C, washed with PBS, and incubated in DMEM at 37 °C. Time course experiments of phagocytosis demonstrated that the plateau is reached after 60 min, and 30 min was used in all of the experiments shown. BAPTA-AM addition started 5 min before the incubation at 37 °C to avoid cell detachment. Phagocytosis was measured by two separate assays. For the morphological analysis, upon completion of phagocytosis the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, washed twice in PBS, and permeabilized with 0.5% BSA, 50 mm NH4Cl, 0.05% saponin in PBS, pH 7.4, and incubated with 0.1% trypan blue. The trypan blue was allowed to freely diffuse into the cells and to counter-stain the internalized beads (visualized only by phase-contrast microscopy), so after trypan blue wash-out, the external beads were still fluorescent (43.Absolom D.R. Basic methods for the study of phagocytosis.Methods Enzymol. 1986; 132: 95-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 44.Mosiman V.L. Patterson B.K. Canterero L. Goolsby C.L.

Excess dye was removed (two washes with PBS), and phagocytosis was visualized using fluorescence microscopy. On each coverslip, 80 or 180 Raw264.7 cells or transfected IMLFs, respectively, were scored, and ∼350 beads per sample were analyzed. Phagocytosis was quantified as the phagocytic index, the number of ingested beads/total number of cells analyzed. Time-lapse images were obtained using a Zeiss LSM510 inverted confocal microscope system (Carl Zeiss, Gottingen, Germany). Images were acquired at 30-s intervals for a total time of 30 min. In the second protocol, phagocytosis was assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis (45.Lehmann A.K. Sornes S. Halstensen A. Phagocytosis. Measurement by flow cytometry.J.

Fluorescence intensity was recorded before (binding) and after 0.1% trypan blue addition (phagocytosis) to quench the fluorescence of the extracellular bound beads. Typically, 2 × 105 events/sample were counted, and the percentages of binding, as the numbers of the fluorescent-positive events (number of cells with beads), were expressed as percentages of total events (number of cells analyzed), and the percentages of phagocytic cells, as the numbers of fluorescent-positive events after trypan blue addition (number of cells with phagocytosed beads), were expressed as percentages of total events. For the biochemical separation of phagosomes, the procedure was performed as in Ref. 47.Larsen E.C. Ueyama T. Brannock P.M. Shirai Y. Saito N. Larsson C. Loegering D. Weber P.B. Lennartz M.R.

Briefly, phagocytosis was performed as described previously using tosyl-activated M-280 Dynabeads (2.8 μm diameter, Invitrogen). At the indicated times, phagocytosing Raw264.7 cells were scraped into ice-cold lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.25 m sucrose, 2.5 mm DTT, 2.5 mm EDTA, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 5 mm imidazole, 50 mm o-phenanthroline, 2 mm pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and sonicated (two times, 20-s pulses). The beads were isolated on ice using a magnet; the unbound material was removed, and the beads were washed with lysis buffer and then solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer (bead-associated membranes). The unbound material was centrifuged 45 min at 100,000 × g at 4 °C; the supernatant (cytosol) was recovered; the pellet was washed with lysis buffer and centrifuged again, and then the final pellet was resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer and sonicated (one time, 20-s pulse) (non-bead associated membranes).

https://openalex.org/W2029549709,"Signal transduction pathways that are modulated by thiol oxidation events are beginning to be uncovered, but these discoveries are limited by the availability of relatively few analytical methods to examine protein oxidation compared to other signaling events such as protein phosphorylation. We report here the coupling of PROP, a method to purify reversibly oxidized proteins, with the proteomic identification of the purified mixture using mass spectrometry. A gene ontology (GO), KEGG enrichment and Wikipathways analysis of the identified proteins indicated a significant enrichment in proteins associated with both translation and mRNA splicing. This methodology also enabled the identification of some of the specific cysteine residue targets within identified proteins that are reversibly oxidized by hydrogen peroxide treatment of intact cells. From these identifications, we determined a potential consensus sequence motif associated with oxidized cysteine residues. Furthermore, because we identified proteins and specific sites of oxidation from both abundant proteins and from far less abundant signaling proteins (e.g. hepatoma derived growth factor, prostaglandin E synthase 3), the results suggest that the PROP procedure was efficient. Thus, this PROP-proteomics methodology offers a sensitive means to identify biologically relevant redox signaling events that occur within intact cells."
https://openalex.org/W2013537480,"Protein tyrosine phosphatase ρ (PTPρ) belongs to the classical receptor type IIB family of protein tyrosine phosphatase, the most frequently mutated tyrosine phosphatase in human cancer. There are evidences to suggest that PTPρ may act as a tumor suppressor gene and dysregulation of Tyr phosphorylation can be observed in diverse diseases, such as diabetes, immune deficiencies and cancer. PTPρ variants in the catalytic domain have been identified in cancer tissues. These natural variants are nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms, variations of a single nucleotide occurring in the coding region and leading to amino acid substitutions. In this study we investigated the effect of amino acid substitution on the structural stability and on the activity of the membrane-proximal catalytic domain of PTPρ. We expressed and purified as soluble recombinant proteins some of the mutants of the membrane-proximal catalytic domain of PTPρ identified in colorectal cancer and in the single nucleotide polymorphisms database. The mutants show a decreased thermal and thermodynamic stability and decreased activation energy relative to phosphatase activity, when compared to wild- type. All the variants show three-state equilibrium unfolding transitions similar to that of the wild- type, with the accumulation of a folding intermediate populated at ∼4.0 M urea."
https://openalex.org/W2164591100,"Miscarriage is the most common complication of pregnancy. Pre-clinical miscarriage has an estimated incidence of 30%, whilst clinical miscarriage has an incidence of 12-15%. Two thirds of pregnancies lost to miscarriage are believed to be attributable to defective placentation, thus a number of studies have sought to identify markers of defective placentation that could be used as clinical biomarkers of miscarriage. Decreased soluble FMS-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt1), placental growth factor (PlGF), and soluble endoglin (sEng) in the maternal circulation during the first trimester have recently been proposed as potential markers of pregnancy loss. However, in these studies clinical samples were only obtained once women had presented with symptoms of miscarriage. In this study we prospectively screened serum samples collected from asymptomatic women with a viable fetus. We assessed maternal serum levels of sFlt1, PlGF and sEng across the first trimester of normal pregnancy and compared levels between women who continued to a live birth, to those who subsequently miscarried. Both sFlt1 and PlGF significantly (p≤0.05) increased across gestation in normal pregnancy with serum levels rising from 0.65±0.12 ng/ml at 6 weeks to 1.85±0.24 ng/ml at 12 weeks for sFlt1, and 57.2±19.2 pg/ml to 106±22.7 pg/ml for PlGF. sEng remained unchanged throughout the the first trimester. Importantly we detected a significant (35%, p≤0.05) decrease in sFlt1 levels between our control and miscarriage cohort, however there was significant overlap between cases and controls, suggesting serum sFlt1 is unlikely to be useful as a clinical biomarker in asymptomatic women. Nevertheless, our data suggests a dysregulation of angiogenic factors may be involved in the pathophysiology of miscarriage."
https://openalex.org/W1998618846,"Background Genetic reassortment plays a critical role in the generation of pandemic strains of influenza virus. The influenza virus RNA polymerase, composed of PB1, PB2 and PA subunits, has been suggested to influence the efficiency of genetic reassortment. However, the role of the RNA polymerase in the genetic reassortment is not well understood. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we reconstituted reassortant ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes, and demonstrated that the PB2 subunit of A/HongKong/156/1997 (H5N1) [HK PB2] dramatically reduced the synthesis of mRNA, cRNA and vRNA when introduced into the polymerase of other influenza strains of H1N1 or H3N2. The HK PB2 had no significant effect on the assembly of the polymerase trimeric complex, or on promoter binding activity or replication initiation activity in vitro. However, the HK PB2 was found to remarkably impair the accumulation of RNP. This impaired accumulation and activity of RNP was fully restored when four amino acids at position 108, 508, 524 and 627 of the HK PB2 were mutated. Conclusions/Significance Overall, we suggest that the PB2 subunit of influenza polymerase might play an important role for the replication of reassortant ribonucleoprotein complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2148415233,"Secretory human prostatic acid phosphatase (hPAP) is glycosylated at three asparagine residues (N62, N188, N301) and has potent antinociceptive effects when administered to mice. Currently, it is unknown if these N-linked residues are required for hPAP protein stability and activity in vitro or in animal models of chronic pain. Here, we expressed wild-type hPAP and a series of Asn to Gln point mutations in the yeast Pichia pastoris X33 then analyzed protein levels and enzyme activity in cell lysates and in conditioned media. Pichia secreted wild-type recombinant (r)-hPAP into the media (6–7 mg protein/L). This protein was as active as native hPAP in biochemical assays and in mouse models of inflammatory pain and neuropathic pain. In contrast, the N62Q and N188Q single mutants and the N62Q, N188Q double mutant were expressed at lower levels and were less active than wild-type r-hPAP. The purified N62Q, N188Q double mutant protein was also 1.9 fold less active in vivo. The N301Q mutant was not expressed, suggesting a critical role for this residue in protein stability. To explicitly test the importance of secretion, a construct lacking the signal peptide of hPAP was expressed in Pichia and assayed. This “cellular” construct was not expressed at levels detectable by western blotting. Taken together, these data indicate that secretion and post-translational carbohydrate modifications are required for PAP protein stability and catalytic activity. Moreover, our findings indicate that recombinant hPAP can be produced in Pichia—a yeast strain that is used to generate biologics for therapeutic purposes."
https://openalex.org/W2083744659,"The delivery of bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) has been widely used to stimulate angiogenesis and arteriogenesis. We identified a progenitor-enriched subpopulation of BMDCs that is able to augment venular remodeling, a generally unexplored area in microvascular research. Two populations of BMDCs, whole bone marrow (WBM) and Lin(-)/Sca-1(+) progenitor cells, were encapsulated in sodium alginate and delivered to a mouse dorsal skinfold chamber model. Upon observation that encapsulated Sca-1(+) progenitor cells enhance venular remodeling, the cells and tissue were analyzed on structural and molecular levels. Venule walls were thickened and contained more nuclei after Sca-1(+) progenitor cell delivery. In addition, progenitors expressed mRNA transcript levels of chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 2 (CXCL2) and interferon gamma (IFNγ) that are over 5-fold higher compared to WBM. Tissues that received progenitors expressed significantly higher protein levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and platelet derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) compared to tissues that received an alginate control construct. Nine days following cell delivery, tissue from progenitor recipients contained 39% more CD45(+) leukocytes, suggesting that these cells may enhance venular remodeling through the modulation of the local immune environment. Results show that different BMDC populations elicit different microvascular responses. In this model, Sca-1(+) progenitor cell-derived CXCL2 and IFNγ may mediate venule enlargement via modulation of the local inflammatory environment."
https://openalex.org/W1984140846,"Prostate cancer is the most common visceral malignancy in Western men and a major cause of cancer deaths. Increased activation of the AKT and NFkB pathways have been identified as critical steps in prostate cancer initiation and progression. GGAP2 (GTP-binding and GTPase activating protein 2) is a multidomain protein that contains an N-terminal Ras homology domain (GTPase), followed by a PH domain, a C-terminal GAP domain and an ankyrin repeat domain. GGAP2 can directly activate signaling via both the AKT and NFkB pathways and acts as a node of crosstalk between these pathways. Increased GGAP2 expression is present in three quarters of prostate cancers. Mutations of GGAP2 have been reported in cell lines from other malignancies. We therefore analyzed 84 prostate cancer tissues and 43 benign prostate tissues for somatic mutations in GGAP2 by direct sequencing of individual clones derived from the GAP and GTPase domains of normal and tumor tissue. Overall, half of cancers contained mutant GAP domain clones and in 20% of cancers, 30% or more of clones were mutant in the GAP domain. Surprisingly, the mutations were heterogeneous and nonclonal, with multiple different mutations being present in many tumors. Similar findings were observed in the analysis of the GTPase domain. Mutant GGAP2 proteins had significantly higher transcriptional activity using AP-1 responsive reporter constructs when compared to wild-type protein. Furthermore, the presence of these mutations was associated with aggressive clinical behavior. The presence of high frequency nonclonal mutations of a single gene is novel and represents a new mode of genetic alteration that can promote tumor progression. Analysis of mutations in cancer has been used to predict outcome and guide therapeutic target identification but such analysis has focused on clonal mutations. Our studies indicate that in some cases high frequency nonclonal mutations may need to be assessed as well."
