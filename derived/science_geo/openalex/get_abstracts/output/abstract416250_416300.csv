Yeast prions might provide a mechanism for generating heritable phenotypic diversity that promotes survival in fluctuating environments and the evolution of new traits. However, this hypothesis is highly controversial. Prions that create new traits have not been found in wild strains, leading to the perception that they are rare ‘diseases’ of laboratory cultivation. Here we biochemically test approximately 700 wild strains of Saccharomyces for [PSI+] or [MOT3+], and find these prions in many. They conferred diverse phenotypes that were frequently beneficial under selective conditions. Simple meiotic re-assortment of the variation harboured within a strain readily fixed one such trait, making it robust and prion-independent. Finally, we genetically screened for unknown prion elements. Fully one-third of wild strains harboured them. These, too, created diverse, often beneficial phenotypes. Thus, prions broadly govern heritable traits in nature, in a manner that could profoundly expand adaptive opportunities. Previously thought to be rare laboratory artefacts or diseases of yeast, prions are actually found in one third of 700 wild strains; the prions give their hosts beneficial traits that can be transmitted epigenetically to the next generation, and then fixed in the genome. It has been suggested that prions — proteins that undergo transmissible conformation changes — serve as elements of inheritance and evolutionary 'facilitators' in yeast, but many still consider fungal prions to be rare laboratory 'diseases'. Now Susan Lindquist and colleagues have screened 700 yeast strains collected from the wild and found 'natural' prions in one-third of them. They also show that many of these natural prions endow their hosts with traits that are either directly beneficial in specific culture conditions or provide favourable ground for further, DNA-based traits to evolve."

https://openalex.org/W1979904005,"Recent findings have suggested that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are important signaling molecules for regulating plant responses to abiotic and biotic stress and that there exist source- and kind-specific pathways for ROS signaling. In plant cells, a major source of ROS is chloroplasts, in which thylakoid membrane-bound ascorbate peroxidase (tAPX) plays a role in the regulation of H(2)O(2) levels. Here, to clarify the signaling function of H(2)O(2) derived from the chloroplast, we created a conditional system for producing H(2)O(2) in the organelle by chemical-dependent tAPX silencing using estrogen-inducible RNAi. When the expression of tAPX was silenced in leaves, levels of oxidized protein in chloroplasts increased in the absence of stress. Microarray analysis revealed that tAPX silencing affects the expression of a large set of genes, some of which are involved in the response to chilling and pathogens. In response to tAPX silencing, the transcript levels of C-repeat/DRE binding factor (CBF1), a central regulator for cold acclimation, was suppressed, resulting in a high sensitivity of tAPX-silenced plants to cold. Furthermore, tAPX silencing enhanced the levels of salicylic acid (SA) and the response to SA. Interestingly, we found that tAPX silencing-responsive genes were up- or down-regulated by high light (HL) and that tAPX silencing had a negative effect on expression of ROS-responsive genes under HL, suggesting synergistic and antagonistic roles of chloroplastic H(2)O(2) in HL response. These findings provide a new insight into the role of H(2)O(2)-triggered retrograde signaling from chloroplasts in the response to stress in planta."
https://openalex.org/W2035688360,"The periplasmic chaperone and serine protease HtrA is important for bacterial stress responses and protein quality control. Recently, we discovered that HtrA from Helicobacter pylori is secreted and cleaves E-cadherin to disrupt the epithelial barrier, but it remained unknown whether this maybe a general virulence mechanism. Here, we show that important other pathogens including enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, and Campylobacter jejuni, but not Neisseria gonorrhoeae, cleaved E-cadherin on host cells. HtrA deletion in C. jejuni led to severe defects in E-cadherin cleavage, loss of cell adherence, paracellular transmigration, and basolateral invasion. Computational modeling of HtrAs revealed a conserved pocket in the active center exhibiting pronounced proteolytic activity. Differential E-cadherin cleavage was determined by an alanine-to-glutamine exchange in the active center of neisserial HtrA. These data suggest that HtrA-mediated E-cadherin cleavage is a prevalent pathogenic mechanism of multiple gram-negative bacteria representing an attractive novel target for therapeutic intervention to combat bacterial infections."

Using a variety of biochemical, molecular, cell-based, and genomic assays, we show that NMNAT-1 and PARP-1 physically and functionally interact at target gene promoters in MCF-7 cells. Specifically, we show that PARP-1 recruits NMNAT-1 to promoters where it produces NAD+ to support PARP-1 catalytic activity, but also enhances the enzymatic activity of PARP-1 independently of NAD+ production. Furthermore, using two-photon excitation microscopy, we show that NMNAT-1 catalyzes the production of NAD+ in a nuclear pool that may be distinct from other cellular compartments. In expression microarray experiments, depletion of NMNAT-1 or PARP-1 alters the expression of about 200 protein-coding genes each, with about 10% overlap between the two gene sets. NMNAT-1 enzymatic activity is required for PARP-1-dependent poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation at the promoters of commonly regulated target genes, as well as the expression of those target genes.

Originally characterized as a critical factor in DNA damage repair, PARP-1 has emerged as an important regulator of gene expression through multiple mechanisms, many of which involve its association with chromatin (1Kraus W.L.

Cell. 2010; 39: 8-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). PARP-1 uses NAD+ as a substrate for poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation), adding linear or branched poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) chains to target proteins (3D'Amours D. Desnoyers S. D'Silva I. Poirier G.G.

However, other nuclear proteins, including histones and chromatin-associated proteins (e.g. transcription factors and histone-modifying enzymes), can also be modified by PARP-1 (1Kraus W.L.

PARylation by PARP-1 consumes NAD+ as a donor of ADP-ribose units, generating nicotinamide as a reaction byproduct (see Fig. 1A). In mammalian cells, an NAD+ salvage/recycling pathway uses nicotinamide for NAD+ synthesis (see Fig. 1A) (5Rongvaux A. Andris F. Van Gool F. Leo O. Reconstructing eukaryotic NAD metabolism.BioEssays. 2003; 25: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase catalyzes the first step of the NAD+ salvage pathway, converting nicotinamide to nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN). NMN is further converted into NAD+ by nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NMNAT). The mammalian nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase enzyme is essential for early embryonic development (6Revollo J.R. Körner A. Mills K.F. Satoh A. Wang T. Garten A. Dasgupta B. Sasaki Y.

The unique nuclear localization of NMNAT-1 suggests that it may play a critical role in maintaining the functions of nuclear NAD+-dependent enzymes, such as PARP-1 and the protein deacetylase SIRT1. Several studies have suggested a role of NMNAT-1 in regulating NAD+-dependent nuclear functions. Overexpression of a chimeric protein with intact NMNAT-1 activity protects neurons against physical, chemical, and genetic insults (14Mack T.G. Reiner M. Beirowski B. Mi W. Emanuelli M. Wagner D.

The results of some studies suggest that nuclear NAD+ production might be a key contributing factor for these protective effects (17Wang J. Zhai Q. Chen Y. Lin E. Gu W. McBurney M.W. He Z.

We have recently shown that NMNAT-1 is recruited to target gene promoters through interactions with promoter-bound SIRT1, where it produces NAD+ that is used by SIRT1 to support its histone deacetylase activity (19Zhang T.

The role of nuclear NAD+ production in transcriptional regulation by PARP-1, however, has not been explored in detail. In this study, we used a variety of biochemical, molecular, cell-based, and genomic assays to examine the physical and functional interactions between NMNAT-1 and PARP-1. Our studies show that NMNAT-1 interacts with PARP-1 at target gene promoters and enhances PARP-1-dependent PARylation at these promoters by producing NAD+. Collectively, our results indicate a functional link between the enzymatic activities of NMNAT-1 and PARP-1 at gene promoters that regulates the expression of a set of common target genes.

https://openalex.org/W2088849763,"The mitotic checkpoint gene CHFR (checkpoint with forkhead-associated (FHA) and RING finger domains) is silenced by promoter hypermethylation or mutated in various human cancers, suggesting that CHFR is an important tumor suppressor. Recent studies have reported that CHFR functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, resulting in the degradation of target proteins. To better understand how CHFR suppresses cell cycle progression and tumorigenesis, we sought to identify CHFR-interacting proteins using affinity purification combined with mass spectrometry. Here we show poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) to be a novel CHFR-interacting protein. In CHFR-expressing cells, mitotic stress induced the autoPARylation of PARP-1, resulting in an enhanced interaction between CHFR and PARP-1 and an increase in the polyubiquitination/degradation of PARP-1. The decrease in PARP-1 protein levels promoted cell cycle arrest at prophase, supporting that the cells expressing CHFR were resistant to microtubule inhibitors. In contrast, in CHFR-silenced cells, polyubiquitination was not induced in response to mitotic stress. Thus, PARP-1 protein levels did not decrease, and cells progressed into mitosis under mitotic stress, suggesting that CHFR-silenced cancer cells were sensitized to microtubule inhibitors. Furthermore, we found that cells from Chfr knockout mice and CHFR-silenced primary gastric cancer tissues expressed higher levels of PARP-1 protein, strongly supporting our data that the interaction between CHFR and PARP-1 plays an important role in cell cycle regulation and cancer therapeutic strategies. On the basis of our studies, we demonstrate a significant advantage for use of combinational chemotherapy with PARP inhibitors for cancer cells resistant to microtubule inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2017401837,"Disturbed Wnt signaling has been implicated in numerous diseases, including type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. In the present study, we have investigated cross-talk between insulin and Wnt signaling pathways using preadipocytes with and without knockdown of the Wnt co-receptors LRP5 and LRP6 and with and without knock-out of insulin and IGF-1 receptors. We find that Wnt stimulation leads to phosphorylation of insulin signaling key mediators, including Akt, GSK3β, and ERK1/2, although with a lower fold stimulation and slower time course than observed for insulin. These Wnt effects are insulin/IGF-1 receptor-dependent and are lost in insulin/IGF-1 receptor double knock-out cells. Conversely, in LRP5 knockdown preadipocytes, insulin-induced phosphorylation of IRS1, Akt, GSK3β, and ERK1/2 is highly reduced. This effect is specific to insulin, as compared with IGF-1, stimulation and appears to be due to an inducible interaction between LRP5 and the insulin receptor as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation. These data demonstrate that Wnt and insulin signaling pathways exhibit cross-talk at multiple levels. Wnt induces phosphorylation of Akt, ERK1/2, and GSK3β, and this is dependent on insulin/IGF-1 receptors. Insulin signaling also involves the Wnt co-receptor LRP5, which has a positive effect on insulin signaling. Thus, altered Wnt and LRP5 activity can serve as modifiers of insulin action and insulin resistance in the pathophysiology of diabetes and metabolic syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2092604129,"Filamin A (FLNa) is a cross-linker of actin filaments and serves as a scaffold protein mostly involved in the regulation of actin polymerization. It is distributed ubiquitously, and null mutations have strong consequences on embryonic development in humans, with organ defects which suggest deficiencies in cell migration. We have reported previously that macrophages, the archetypal migratory cells, use the protease- and podosome-dependent mesenchymal migration mode in dense three-dimensional environments, whereas they use the protease- and podosome-independent amoeboid mode in more porous matrices. Because FLNa has been shown to localize to podosomes, we hypothesized that the defects seen in patients carrying FLNa mutations could be related to the capacity of certain cell types to form podosomes. Using strategies based on FLNa knock-out, knockdown, and rescue, we show that FLNa (i) is involved in podosome stability and their organization as rosettes and three-dimensional podosomes, (ii) regulates the proteolysis of the matrix mediated by podosomes in macrophages, (iii) is required for podosome rosette formation triggered by Hck, and (iv) is necessary for mesenchymal migration but dispensable for amoeboid migration. These new functions assigned to FLNa, particularly its role in mesenchymal migration, could be directly related to the defects in cell migration described during the embryonic development in FLNa-defective patients."

https://openalex.org/W2150727193,"The control of cellular water flow is mediated by the aquaporin (AQP) family of membrane proteins. The structural features of the family and the mechanism of selective water passage through the AQP pore are established, but there remains a gap in our knowledge of how water transport is regulated. Two broad possibilities exist. One is controlling the passage of water through the AQP pore, but this only has been observed as a phenomenon in some plant and microbial AQPs. An alternative is controlling the number of AQPs in the cell membrane. Here, we describe a novel pathway in mammalian cells whereby a hypotonic stimulus directly induces intracellular calcium elevations through transient receptor potential channels, which trigger AQP1 translocation. This translocation, which has a direct role in cell volume regulation, occurs within 30 s and is dependent on calmodulin activation and phosphorylation of AQP1 at two threonine residues by protein kinase C. This direct mechanism provides a rationale for the changes in water transport that are required in response to constantly changing local cellular water availability. Moreover, because calcium is a pluripotent and ubiquitous second messenger in biological systems, the discovery of its role in the regulation of AQP translocation has ramifications for diverse physiological and pathophysiological processes, as well as providing an explanation for the rapid regulation of water flow that is necessary for cell homeostasis."

Remarkably, light echoes from that event are still reaching us, and analyses of their spectra reveal unexpected features that place important constrains on the eruption mechanism. No emission lines are present, only blueshifted absorption lines. The spectra resemble those of G2-to-G5 supergiants, which have effective temperatures of about 5,000 K, which is significantly cooler than expected. η Carinae is one of the most massive binary stars in the Milky Way1,2. It became the second-brightest star in our sky during its mid-nineteenth-century ‘Great Eruption’, but then faded from view (with only naked-eye estimates of brightness3,4). Its eruption is unique in that it exceeded the Eddington luminosity limit for ten years. Because it is only 2.3 kiloparsecs away, spatially resolved studies of the nebula have constrained the ejected mass and velocity, indicating that during its nineteenth-century eruption, η Car ejected more than ten solar masses in an event that released ten per cent of the energy of a typical core-collapse supernova5,6, without destroying the star. Here we report observations of light echoes of η Carinae from the 1838–1858 Great Eruption. Spectra of these light echoes show only absorption lines, which are blueshifted by −210 km s−1, in good agreement with predicted expansion speeds6. The light-echo spectra correlate best with those of G2-to-G5 supergiants, which have effective temperatures of around 5,000 kelvin. In contrast to the class of extragalactic outbursts assumed to be analogues of the Great Eruption of η Carinae7,8,9,10,11,12, the effective temperature of its outburst is significantly lower than that allowed by standard opaque wind models13. This indicates that other physical mechanisms such as an energetic blast wave may have triggered and influenced the eruption."

HDAC6 directly binds survivin, an interaction that is enhanced by CBP. In quiescent breast cancer cells in culture and in malignant tissue sections from ER+ breast tumors, HDAC6 localizes to a perinuclear region of the cell, undergoing transport to the nucleus following CBP activation where it then deacetylates survivin. Genetically modified mouse embryonic fibroblasts that lack mhdac6 localize survivin predominantly to the nuclear compartment, whereas wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts localize survivin to distinct cytoplasmic structures.

We showed that CBP-dependent acetylation at Lys-129 maintains survivin nuclear localization by promoting its homodimerization and stability in this compartment. By contrast, mutation at this residue to a non-acetylatable amino acid inhibits survivin homodimerization, promotes binding to the nuclear export protein Crm1, and results in export to the cytoplasmic compartment.

Once activated by CBP in an estrogen-dependent manner, HDAC6 enters the nucleus, promoting survivin deacetylation and nuclear export.

MEF cells were cultured in DMEM media supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. For experiments involving estrogen, MCF-7 cells were cultured for 48 h in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 5% charcoal-stripped FBS then serum-starved overnight prior to treatment with estradiol (10 nm) for 6 h. Trichostatin A (TSA) and nicotinamide were purchased from Sigma. 6×Myc survivin 129K or 129E and HA-CBP were generated as described previously (8Wang H. Holloway M.P. Ma L. Cooper Z.A. Riolo M.

FLAG-HDAC plasmids 1, 2, 3, and 6 were kind gifts from Dr. Edward Seto (Lee Moffitt Cancer Institute, Tampa, FL). Truncated HDAC6 constructs Hdase I (1–414), Hdase II (415–903), and ZIF (904–1215) were generated using PCR amplification from human full-length HDAC6 cDNA with primers containing XbaI and BamHI restriction sites (Hdase I) or XbaI and EcoRI restriction sites (Hdase II and ZIF) and cloned into the N-terminal p3XFLAG-CMV-9 expression vector (Sigma). The HDAC6-dead mutant was a kind gift from Dr. Stuart Schreiber (The Broad Institute and Harvard University, Cambridge, MA). Plasmids were transfected into HEK293T and HeLa cells using either Lipofectamine 2000 or Lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen) for 48 h. CBP and control siRNA (sc-29244) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. MCF-7 cells were transfected with control siRNA (300 pmol) or CBP siRNA (300 pmol) using LipoRNAiMax (Invitrogen). Treated and transfected cells were washed twice with cold PBS, lysed on ice with cell lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2 EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate) plus protease inhibitors (1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm PMSF), scraped, and collected in microcentrifuge tubes and incubated on ice for 30 min. For immunoprecipitations, lysates were precleared with protein A/G plus agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Supernatants were incubated at 4 °C with anti-Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight and then incubated on a rocking shaker at 4 °C with protein A/G plus agarose beads for 4 h. Samples were washed, and pellets were denatured in SDS loading buffer and boiled prior to separation by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting of immunoprecipitation and total protein samples was performed on PVDF membranes with antibodies for acetylated survivin (Novus Biologicals), full-length survivin, CBP, HDAC6, Myc, actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), FLAG (Cell Signaling), α-tubulin (Sigma), and HDAC1 (Affinity Bioreagents). For subcellular fractionation, cells were collected in low salt hypotonic buffer (buffer A; 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1% IGEPAL (Nonidet P-40)) plus protease inhibitors (1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm PMSF) and incubated for 15 min at 4 °C on a rotating shaker. Lysates were then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were collected in separate tubes (cytoplasmic fraction), and pellets were washed with buffer A and recentrifuged as above. Pellets were washed with cold PBS and centrifuged. Pellets were resuspended in high salt hypotonic buffer (buffer B; 20 mm Tris pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 400 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm EGTA) plus protease inhibitors and then incubated for 30 min in 4 °C on a rotating shaker. Lysates were then centrifuged, and supernatants were collected in separate tubes (nuclear fraction). Membranes were immunoblotted with antibodies to acetylated survivin (Novus Biologicals), full-length survivin, CBP, HDAC6, Myc, actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), FLAG (Cell Signaling), α-tubulin (Sigma), and HDAC1 (Affinity Bioreagents). Cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde then blocked and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100, 3% BSA in PBS. Primary antibody was rabbit anti-acetylated survivin (Novus Biologicals), mouse anti-survivin (D-8), and rabbit anti-HDAC6 (H-300) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Secondary antibody was anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Dylight 488 and anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Dylight 594 (ThermoFisher Scientific). Slides were mounted with Prolong anti-fade reagent (Invitrogen). Images were captured using a Nikon C1si Confocal microscope. In previous work, we demonstrated that the histone acetyltransferase protein CBP induced survivin acetylation on multiple lysine residues in the estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cell line, MCF-7 (8Wang H. Holloway M.P. Ma L. Cooper Z.A. Riolo M. Samkari A. Elenitoba-Johnson K.S. Chin Y.E. Altura R.A. Acetylation directs survivin nuclear localization to repress STAT3 oncogenic activity.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 36129-36137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Through mutational analyses, we also showed that loss of CBP-dependent acetylation at Lys-129 facilitates Crm1-mediated nuclear export of deacetylated survivin, suggesting that survivin acetylation dictates whether it functions as a nuclear or cytosolic protein. To determine the histone deacetylase(s) responsible for deacetylating survivin at this and other residues, we treated MCF-7 cells with either the class I/II inhibitor TSA for 6 h or the class III inhibitor nicotinamide for 24 h, or with both, harvested for total cellular protein, and then performed Western blots using an antibody generated to the specific survivin-acetylated Lys-129 residue or an antibody generated to full-length (total) survivin. In TSA-treated MCF-7 cells, robust levels of acetylated survivin protein were observed (Fig. 1A). By contrast, nicotinamide had no effect on survivin acetylation, and no additional increases in acetylation were observed after treatment with both TSA and nicotinamide, suggesting that although class I/II HDACs play a role in deacetylating survivin, class III proteins do not. Total survivin was unchanged in either condition when detected with the antibody against the full-length protein, as expected given that acetylated survivin is a small fraction of the total survivin pool. To determine the dose- and time-dependent effects of TSA on survivin acetylation, we treated MCF-7 cells with increasing concentrations of TSA over a series of time points. Our results demonstrated that 1 μm TSA induced maximal survivin Lys-129 acetylation (Fig. 1B), first detected at 1 h and steadily increasing by 6 h (Fig. 1C), indicating a time- and concentration dependence that should be linked to a functional role for survivin acetylation states. Similar results were also observed in HeLa cells (supplemental Fig. S1). To demonstrate the effects of HDAC inhibition on the subcellular distribution of survivin, we co-immunostained MCF-7 cells with an antibody to total survivin and to acetylated survivin. In the absence of TSA, a small, basal level of acetylated survivin was detected that localized to the nucleus (Fig. 1D, upper panel). Following TSA treatment, the levels of acetylated survivin significantly increased (∼10-fold) in the nuclear compartment (Fig. 1D, lower panel). Total survivin however, was detected in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus of untreated and treated cells. These results were consistent with the Western blot data, suggesting that class I/II HDACs are involved in survivin deacetylation. CBP is a central histone acetyltransferase that acetylates multiple cancer-associated proteins and thereby alters their activity (11Yang X.J. Seto E. HATs and HDACs: From structure, function, and regulation to novel strategies for therapy and prevention.Oncogene. 2007; 26: 5310-5318Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar, 14Iyer N.G. Ozdag H.

Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 284-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). To demonstrate the CBP-specific effect on survivin acetylation, we transfected HeLa cells with an expression plasmid encoding HA-tagged CBP then immunostained the cells with the survivin-acetylated antibody. CBP highly induced survivin acetylation, and the acetylated survivin protein displayed a nuclear staining pattern after CBP transfection that was similar to that seen following TSA treatment (Fig. 2A). To identify the specific HDAC(s) that deacetylates survivin, we co-transfected HEK293 cells with a Myc-tagged survivin and CBP construct, along with either empty vector, or one of the class I/II HDACs; HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, or HDAC6 and then performed Western blotting on total cell lysates using the survivin-acetylated antibody. The results showed that CBP-dependent survivin acetylation was unaffected by HDAC1, -2, and -3, but was abolished by HDAC6 (Fig. 2B). These results were recapitulated in HeLa cells (Fig. 2C). HDAC6 is a unique member of the HDAC class IIb family, structurally composed of duplicate catalytic domains and a third ubiquitin-binding domain (11Yang X.J. Seto E. HATs and HDACs: From structure, function, and regulation to novel strategies for therapy and prevention.Oncogene. 2007; 26: 5310-5318Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar, 16Aldana-Masangkay G.I. Sakamoto K.M. The role of HDAC6 in cancer.J. Biomed. Biotechnol. 2011; 2011: 875824Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). To identify the domain responsible for the survivin deacetylase activity, we constructed three truncated forms of HDAC6 from the full-length HDAC6 cDNA, corresponding to each domain; histone deacetylase domain 1 (amino acids 1–414), histone deacetylase domain 2 (amino acids 415–903), and ubiquitin binding domain 3 (amino acids 904–1215) (Fig. 2D). We co-transfected HeLa cells with Myc-survivin; HA-CBP; FLAG-HDAC6 domain 1, 2, or 3; full-length HDAC6 or empty vector; with the latter two as positive and negative deacetylase controls, respectively. We performed Western blotting on total cell lysates using the survivin-acetylated antibody. Our results demonstrated that similar to full-length HDAC6, domain 2 alone abolished CBP-mediated survivin acetylation, whereas domains 1 and 3 had little to no effect (Fig. 2E). To further validate that HDAC6 domain 2 is responsible for survivin deacetylation, we utilized an HDAC6 construct (HDAC6-dm) containing a double point mutation that lacks deacetylase activity (12Grozinger C.M. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Three proteins define a class of human histone deacetylases related to yeast Hda1p.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 4868-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrated that CBP-dependent survivin acetylation is restored when the HDAC6 deacetylase activity is inactivated (Fig. 2F). Taken together, the data suggest that domain 2 of HDAC6 is necessary and sufficient to inhibit CBP-dependent survivin acetylation. This is consistent with published reports demonstrating that domain 2 is responsible for the deacetylase activity of other proteins (17Zou H. Wu Y. Navre M. Sang B.C. Characterization of the two catalytic domains in histone deacetylase 6.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 341: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 18Zhang Y. Gilquin B. Khochbin S. Matthias P. Two catalytic domains are required for protein deacetylation.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2401-2404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). As HDAC6 is mainly cytoplasmic but can be stimulated to enter the nucleus via its nuclear localization signal (19Bertos N.R. Gilquin B. Chan G.K. Yen T.J. Khochbin S. Yang X.J. Role of the tetradecapeptide repeat domain of human histone deacetylase 6 in cytoplasmic retention.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48246-48254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), we sought to determine the subcellular compartment(s) within which HDAC6 deacetylates survivin. To examine the endogenous distribution of HDAC6 and acetylated survivin in MCF-7 cells, we performed subcellular fractionation in the presence and absence of TSA. Untreated MCF-7 cells demonstrated a basal level of nuclear acetylated survivin, which significantly increased following TSA treatment (Fig. 3A), consistent with our previous microscopy results (Fig. 1D). HDAC6 primarily localized to the cytoplasm under both conditions. HDAC6 protein levels were not altered by TSA, consistent with TSA-mediated inhibition of HDAC6 enzymatic activity but not protein steady state. To determine the compartment(s) where HDAC6 deacetylates survivin, we first performed subcellular fractionation. We co-transfected HEK293 cells with Myc-survivin and FLAG-HDAC6 constructs in the presence or absence of CBP then analyzed the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions by Western blot. In the absence of CBP-driven acetylation, total survivin and HDAC6 were localized primarily within the cytoplasm (Fig. 3B, left panel). Following CBP-driven acetylation, both total survivin and HDAC6 dramatically increased within the nuclear compartment (Fig. 3B, right panel), indicating that CBP-dependent acetylation induces nuclear survivin accumulation and promotes HDAC6 nuclear trafficking, potentially as a control mechanism to regulate the nuclear levels of acetylated survivin. Correspondingly, CBP-induced acetylated survivin was detected in both nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments and was abolished in both compartments by wild-type HDAC6. To further investigate the subcellular region(s) where HDAC6 deacetylates survivin under different conditions, we transfected HeLa cells with and without HDAC6 or CBP and performed immunofluorescence microscopy. In non-transfected cells, endogenous HDAC6 exhibited a perinuclear staining pattern with minimal colocalization with nuclear survivin (Fig. 3C, top row). This pattern was similarly observed after HDAC6 transfection, with a substantial increase in staining noted around the nuclear membrane (Fig. 3C, middle row). The same perinuclear staining pattern was observed in tissue sections obtained from ER-positive breast carcinomas immunostained with anti-HDAC6 (Fig. 3D), supporting the cell culture results. Following CBP transfection in HeLa cells, HDAC6 localized primarily within the nucleus and colocalized with nuclear survivin (Fig. 3C, bottom row). These results show that CBP can induce HDAC6 nuclear import, while maintaining acetylated survivin sequestered in the nuclear compartment. Although it has been reported that HDAC6 binds nuclear proteins (20Palijan A. Fernandes I. Verway M. Kourelis M. Bastien Y. Tavera-Mendoza L.E. Sacheli A. Bourdeau V. Mader S. White J.H. Ligand-dependent corepressor LCoR is an attenuator of progesterone-regulated gene expression.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 30275-30287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and that its structure includes an N-terminal nuclear import signal (19Bertos N.R. Gilquin B. Chan G.K. Yen T.J. Khochbin S. Yang X.J. Role of the tetradecapeptide repeat domain of human histone deacetylase 6 in cytoplasmic retention.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48246-48254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), factors regulating its entry into the nucleus have not been identified. The demonstration that CBP can stimulate HDAC6 nuclear entry strongly suggests that HDAC6 itself is modified by histone acetyltransferase proteins. To establish whether survivin is a direct substrate of HDAC6, HDAC6 was immunoprecipitated from non-transfected HeLa cells or after transfection with HDAC6 or CBP. HDAC6-survivin immunoprecipitants were not well visualized in the non-transfected cells; however, binding between the two proteins was observed in HDAC6-transfected cells and was further increased in CBP-transfected cells (Fig. 3E), consistent with a direct association between HDAC6 and survivin in the nucleus (Fig. 3C). To examine the potential in vivo requirements for HDAC6 regulating survivin function, we immunostained HDAC6 null and wild-type (WT) MEFs (kind gift from the laboratory of Dr. Tso-Pang Yao, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC) with anti-survivin. The localization pattern of survivin differed in these two cell types. Although the WT cells displayed a punctate, cytoplasmic pattern that was excluded from the nucleus (Z-stack, Fig. 3F), the HDAC6 null cells exhibited a primarily nuclear pattern (Fig. 3F), suggesting that HDAC6-mediated survivin deacetylation is required for survivin nuclear export. Collectively, these results support a role for HDAC6 as a guardian or gatekeeper at the nuclear-cytoplasmic border, inhibiting acetylated survivin nuclear export under resting conditions. When stimulated by histone acetyltransferase proteins, HDAC6 is imported into the nucleus and binds survivin to deacetylate the protein as a likely control mechanism to regulate increasing levels of nuclear acetylated survivin and perhaps to increase its cytoplasmic concentration for its anti-apoptotic activity (9Chan K.S. Wong C.H. Huang Y.F. Li H.Y. Survivin withdrawal by nuclear export failure as a physiological switch to commit cells to apoptosis.Cell Death Dis. 2010; 1: e57Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). HDAC6, like survivin, is exported from the nucleus by Crm1 (21Verdel A. Curtet S. Brocard M.P. Rousseaux S. Lemercier C. Yoshida M. Khochbin S. Active maintenance of mHDA2/mHDAC6 histone-deacetylase in the cytoplasm.Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 747-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar); therefore, we investigated whether an HDAC6-Crm1 complex is required for survivin deacetylation. Endogenous HDAC6 immunoprecipitants showed strong binding to Crm1 under unstimulated conditions (Fig. 4A). To determine whether Crm1 is required for survivin deacetylation, we treated HeLa cells with the Crm1 inhibitor, leptomycin B (LB), and performed Western blot assays for acetylated survivin. HDAC6 inhibited survivin acetylation both in the presence and absence of LB (Fig. 4B), suggesting that Crm1 is not required for survivin deacetylation by HDAC6. These findings were corroborated by immunofluorescence, demonstrating that HDAC6 localizes to the nucleus and colocalizes with survivin under conditions where Crm1 is inactivated by LB (Fig. 4C). Estrogen was shown recently to increase CBP acetyltransferase activity through coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase-induced methylation (22Ceschin D.G. Walia M. Wenk S.S. Duboé C. Gaudon C. Xiao Y. Fauquier L. Sankar M. Vandel L. Gronemeyer H. Methylation specifies distinct estrogen-induced binding site repertoires of CBP to chromatin.Genes Dev. 2011; 25: 1132-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Given our observations that CBP acetylates nuclear survivin, we examined whether estrogen affects survivin expression and localization in MCF-7 cells. Cells were starved for 48 h, treated with 10 nm estradiol or vehicle control for 6 h, and then fixed and co-immunostained with anti-survivin and anti-acetylated survivin. Estrogen treatment mimicked the effects observed previously after CBP transfection (shown in Fig. 2B), promoting an increase in the levels of nuclear acetylated survivin (Fig. 5A). As expected from the observed increase in acetylated survivin, estrogen also enhanced total survivin nuclear localization (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, under conditions of low serum and no estrogen, survivin localized in a punctate, cytoplasmic granular pattern (Fig. 5B), similar to the staining pattern of survivin observed in the HDAC6 WT MEFs, suggesting a potential link between estrogen, survivin, and HDAC6. These effects were also observed when cells were treated with the estrogen receptor antagonist, tamoxifen (supplemental Fig. S2). To determine the effect of estrogen on HDAC6 levels, we performed Western blots on total cell lysates isolated from the estrogen-treated MCF-7 cells. Estrogen treatment was associated with higher levels of HDAC6 as well as acetylated survivin proteins (Fig. 5C), supporting results of clinical studies that show an increase in HDAC6 levels in estrogen receptor-positive breast tumors (23Zhang Z. Yamashita H. Toyama T. Sugiura H. Omoto Y. Ando Y. Mita K. Hamaguchi M. Hayashi S. Iwase H. HDAC6 expression is correlated with better survival in breast cancer.Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 6962-6968Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 24Saji S. Kawakami M. Hayashi S. Yoshida N. Hirose M. Horiguchi S. Itoh A. Funata N. Schreiber S.L. Yoshida M. Toi M. Significance of HDAC6 regulation via estrogen signaling for cell motility and prognosis in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.Oncogene. 2005; 24: 4531-4539Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). To examine the effects of estrogen on HDAC6 subcellular localization, we performed immunofluorescence microscopy. In the absence of estrogen, HDAC6 localized to perinuclear regions of the cell. However, after estrogen treatment its localization increased within the nucleus, as demonstrated by z-stack analysis (Fig. 5D). Together, these data show that estrogen treatment leads to an increase in both acetylated survivin and nuclear HDAC6 levels, possibly through increasing CBP activity. To determine the requirement for CBP in the nuclear induction of HDAC6 in response to estrogen, we knocked down CBP using siRNA in MCF-7 cells. We then isolated cell nuclei and examined the levels of HDAC6 under conditions of low serum and following estrogen treatment. MCF-7 cells transfected with CBP siRNA resulted in an ∼90% decrease in nuclear CBP protein (Fig. 5E). Interestingly, estrogen led to an increase in endogenous CBP levels in the nuclei of control siRNA-treated cells, consistent with a stabilization of CBP protein in this compartment mediated by estrogen. However, knockdown of CBP in the presence of estrogen resulted in a decrease in HDAC6 protein within cell nuclei (75% of control levels). This finding supports a requirement for CBP in an estrogen-mediated induction of nuclear HDAC6 in MCF-7 cells. HDAC proteins have become pervasive cancer treatment targets due to their involvement in multiple signaling pathways that provide a survival advantage for tumor cells (5Marks P.A. Histone deacetylase inhibitors: A chemical genetics approach to understanding cellular functions.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1799: 717-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The class IIb deacetylase, HDAC6 increases cancer cell motility and promotes metastatic spread in breast cancer models (24Saji S. Kawakami M. Hayashi S. Yoshida N. Hirose M. Horiguchi S. Itoh A. Funata N. Schreiber S.L. Yoshida M. Toi M.

Cell Biol. 2011; 90: 128-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Inhibition of HDAC6 leads to deregulation of acetylation of multiple proteins, resulting in a disruption of microtubule dynamics and aggresome formation, promoting cancer cell death (26Kawaguchi Y. Kovacs J.J. McLaurin A. Vance J.M. Ito A. Yao T.P. The deacetylase HDAC6 regulates aggresome formation and cell viability in response to misfolded protein stress.Cell. 2003; 115: 727-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar). Here, we identified another target for HDAC6, the anti-apoptotic protein survivin. Principally understood as a cytoplasmic protein (27Boyault C. Sadoul K. Pabion M. Khochbin S. HDAC6, at the cross-roads between cytoskeleton and cell signaling by acetylation and ubiquitination.Oncogene. 2007; 26: 5468-5476Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), we demonstrate a novel nuclear role for HDAC6 in deacetylating survivin. Following estrogen-dependent CBP activation, HDAC6 enters the nucleus and interacts with survivin in a mechanism to regulate its acetylation state and promote its nuclear exit. The multiple functions of survivin are dependent on its highly regulated expression in distinct subcellular pools (28Altieri D.C. New wirings in the survivin networks.Oncogene. 2008; 27: 6276-6284Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). We showed previously that survivin nuclear export was dependent on its acetylation state (8Wang H. Holloway M.P. Ma L. Cooper Z.A. Riolo M. Samkari A. Elenitoba-Johnson K.S. Chin Y.E. Altura R.A. Acetylation directs survivin nuclear localization to repress STAT3 oncogenic activity.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 36129-36137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Here, we identify that HDAC6-mediated deacetylation promotes its nuclear exit. In wild-type MEFs and in serum-starved breast cancer cells, survivin localizes to cytoplasmic aggregates, whereas in hdac6 null MEFs and estrogen-treated breast cancer cells, survivin localizes diffusely within the nucleus. Although the nature of the survivin cytoplasmic aggregates is yet unclear, HDAC6-dependent aggresome formation exhibits a similar cytoplasmic staining pattern, suggesting they may represent a component of aggresomes or be involved in autophagy (29Iwata A. Riley B.E. Johnston J.A. Kopito R.R. HDAC6 and microtubules are required for autophagic degradation of aggregated huntingtin.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40282-40292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Deacetylation of survivin may potentially promote its interaction with α-tubulin, the binding site for which is located within the domain containing amino acids 99–142 (30Altieri D.C. Survivin, cancer networks, and pathway-directed drug discovery.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar), which includes the lysine 129 site. HDAC6 is an estrogen-regulated protein (24Saji S. Kawakami M. Hayashi S. Yoshida N. Hirose M. Horiguchi S. Itoh A. Funata N. Schreiber S.L. Yoshida M. Toi M. Significance of HDAC6 regulation via estrogen signaling for cell motility and prognosis in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.Oncogene. 2005; 24: 4531-4539Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and has been investigated as a potential prognostic factor for ER+ breast cancer. Most ER+ tumors analyzed express HDAC6; however, there is conflicting data on how increased expression may influence patient prognosis. Although Yoshida et al. (31Yoshida N. Omoto Y. Inoue A. Eguchi H. Kobayashi Y. Kurosumi M. Saji S. Suemasu K. Okazaki T. Nakachi K. Fujita T. Hayashi S. Prediction of prognosis of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer with combination of selected estrogen-regulated genes.Cancer Sci. 2004; 95: 496-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) suggest that high HDAC6 expression correlates with poor prognosis, Zhang et al. (23Zhang Z. Yamashita H. Toyama T. Sugiura H. Omoto Y. Ando Y. Mita K. Hamaguchi M. Hayashi S. Iwase H. HDAC6 expression is correlated with better survival in breast cancer.Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 6962-6968Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) report that it correlates with better prognosis. Our results suggest that HDAC6 expression levels may not be as critical as its subcellular localization, providing a potential explanation for previous clinical discrepancies. A distinct perinuclear staining pattern was observed by immunohistochemistry in invasive ductal carcinoma, which correlates with the pattern we observed in untreated breast cancer cells in vitro. By contrast, treatment of breast cancer cells with estrogen stimulated its nuclear localization. Together, our results suggest that estrogen signaling may be a key factor that promotes HDAC6 nuclear localization and may regulate its deacetylation of survivin as well as other yet unidentified nuclear oncoproteins. In summary, here we identify HDAC6 as a survivin deacetylase at the nuclear-cytosolic junction of ER+ breast cancer cells. HDAC6 is induced to enter the nucleus by the histone acetyltransferase protein CBP and is required for survivin nuclear export, suggesting a control mechanism that promotes trafficking of deacetylated survivin out of the nucleus, perhaps to enhance its function within the cytosol (Fig. 6). In a similar manner, the growth hormone estrogen induces both survivin and HDAC6 protein levels as well as HDAC6 nuclear entry, suggesting its importance in regulating survivin function in ER+ breast tumors. The dynamic regulation of survivin acetylation/deacetylation may provide an opportunistic target for the treatment of these tumors. We thank Ginny Horvasian for help with confocal microscopy.

Although expression of AQP1, -3, -4, -5, -8, -9, and -11 has been reported in the central nervous system, it is AQP4 that is predominately expressed. Its importance in fluid regulation in cerebral edema conditions has been highlighted in several studies, and we have also shown that translational regulation of AQP4 by miR-320a could prove to be useful in infarct volume reduction in middle cerebral artery occluded rat brain. There is evidence for the existence of two AQP4 transcripts (M1 and M23) in the brain arising from two alternative promoters. Because the AQP4 M1 isoform exhibits greater water permeability, in this study, we explored the possibility of microRNA-based transcriptional regulation of the AQP4 M1 promoter. Using RegRNA software, we identified 34 microRNAs predicted to target the AQP4 M1 promoter region. MicroRNA profiling, quantitative stem-loop PCR, and luciferase reporter assays revealed that miR-130a, -152, -668, -939, and -1280, which were highly expressed in astrocytes, could regulate the promoter activity. Of these, miR-130a was identified as a strong transcriptional repressor of the AQP4 M1 isoform. In vivo studies revealed that LNA(TM) anti-miR-130a could up-regulate the AQP4 M1 transcript and its protein to bring about a reduction in cerebral infarct and promote recovery."
https://openalex.org/W2001451165,"Unbiased proteomic screens provide a powerful tool for defining protein-protein interaction networks. Previous studies employed multidimensional protein identification technology to identify the Sox2-interactome in embryonic stem cells (ESC) undergoing differentiation in response to a small increase in the expression of epitope-tagged Sox2. Thus far the Sox2-interactome in ESC has not been determined. To identify the Sox2-interactome in ESC, we engineered ESC for inducible expression of different combinations of epitope-tagged Sox2 along with Oct4, Klf4, and c-Myc. Epitope-tagged Sox2 was used to circumvent the lack of suitable Sox2 antibodies needed to perform an unbiased proteomic screen of Sox2-associated proteins. Although i-OS-ESC differentiate when both Oct4 and Sox2 are elevated, i-OSKM-ESC do not differentiate even when the levels of the four transcription factors are coordinately elevated ∼2-3-fold. Our findings with i-OS-ESC and i-OSKM-ESC provide new insights into the reasons why ESC undergo differentiation when Sox2 and Oct4 are elevated in ESC. Importantly, the use of i-OSKM-ESC enabled us to identify the Sox2-interactome in undifferentiated ESC. Using multidimensional protein identification technology, we identified >70 proteins that associate with Sox2 in ESC. We extended these findings by testing the function of the Sox2-assoicated protein Smarcd1 and demonstrate that knockdown of Smarcd1 disrupts the self-renewal of ESC and induces their differentiation. Together, our work provides the first description of the Sox2-interactome in ESC and indicates that Sox2 along with other master regulators is part of a highly integrated protein-protein interaction landscape in ESC."
https://openalex.org/W2063583344,"Microcin E492 (Mcc), a low molecular weight bacteriocin produced by Klebsiella pneumoniae RYC492, has been shown to exist in two forms: soluble forms that are believed to be toxic to the bacterial cell by forming pores and non-toxic fibrillar forms that share similar biochemical and biophysical properties with amyloids associated with several human diseases. Here we report that fibrils polymerized in vitro from soluble forms sequester toxic species that can be released upon changing environmental conditions such as pH, ionic strength, and upon dilution. Our results indicate that basic pH (≥8.5), low NaCl concentrations (≤50 mm), and dilution (>10-fold) destabilize Mcc fibrils into more soluble species that are found to be toxic to the target cells. Additionally, we also found a similar conversion of non-toxic fibrils into highly toxic oligomers using Mcc aggregates produced in vivo. Moreover, the soluble protein released from fibrils is able to rapidly polymerize into amyloid fibrils under fibril-forming conditions and to efficiently seed aggregation of monomeric Mcc. Our findings indicate that fibrillar forms of Mcc constitute a reservoir of toxic oligomeric species that is released into the medium upon changing the environmental conditions. These findings may have substantial implications to understand the dynamic process of interconversion between toxic and non-toxic aggregated species implicated in protein misfolding diseases.

Bacteriocins are a group of polypeptide antibiotics excreted by different bacterial genera including Gram-negative and Gram-positive species (1Riley M.A. Molecular mechanisms of bacteriocin evolution.Annu.

Antibacterial activity of Mcc appeared to be restricted to the Enterobacteriaceae species, closely related to the producer strain that directly competes with Klebsiella to occupy a spatial niche in the ecosystem (5de Lorenzo V.

FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1984; 23: 117-124Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Mcc has been shown to exert its toxic effect by forming ion channels on the cell membrane of target cells in a receptor-mediated fashion, which leads to a rapid depolarization and thus permeabilization of the cell membrane (6Destoumieux-Garzón D.

Microcin E492 forms ion channels in phospholipid bilayer membrane.FEBS Lett. 1993; 321: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Unlike other bacteriocins, toxic forms of Mcc are produced mainly in the exponential phase and comparatively less toxic in the stationary phase (5de Lorenzo V. Martínez J.L. Asensio C. Microcin-mediated interactions between Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli strains.J. Gen. Microbiol. 1984; 130: 391-400PubMed Google Scholar, 10de Lorenzo V. Factors affecting microcin E492 production.J. Antibiot. 1985; 38: 340-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, neither apparent differences in the amounts of Mcc nor degradation or post-translational modifications have been shown to be responsible for the loss of activity (11Corsini G. Baeza M. Monasterio O. Lagos R. The expression of genes involved in microcin maturation regulates the production of active microcin E492.Biochimie. 2002; 84: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Some reports have described that these changes in Mcc toxicity may be due to the production of a microcin antagonist known as enterochelin in the stationary phase (12Orellana C. Lagos R. The activity of microcin E492 from Klebsiella pneumoniae is regulated by a microcin antagonist.FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 136: 297-303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, the loss of Mcc toxicity in the stationary phase has been attributed to changes in the folding and polymerization of Mcc into aggregated structures similar to amyloid fibrils (13Bieler S. Estrada L. Lagos R. Baeza M. Castilla J. Soto C. Amyloid formation modulates the biological activity of a bacterial protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26880-26885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Compelling in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that the changes on the Mcc activity during the bacterial life cycle is due to the conversion of toxic soluble Mcc (produced in the exponential phase) into non-toxic amyloid-like fibrils (produced in stationary phase) (13Bieler S. Estrada L. Lagos R. Baeza M. Castilla J. Soto C. Amyloid formation modulates the biological activity of a bacterial protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26880-26885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These results are intriguing as they suggest that amyloid formation once thought to be exclusively associated with human diseases (such as Alzheimer, Parkinson, diabetes type II, and prion diseases) also plays a role on modulating the biological activity of proteins in such distant organisms as bacteria. There are many similarities between Mcc amyloid fibrils and those formed by disease-associated proteins, namely β-sheet-rich secondary structure, morphology under electron microscopy, binding to amyloid specific dies, protease resistance, and a seeding nucleation mechanism of polymerization (13Bieler S. Estrada L. Lagos R. Baeza M. Castilla J. Soto C. Amyloid formation modulates the biological activity of a bacterial protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26880-26885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Mcc aggregates are also toxic to eukaryotic cells (14Hetz C. Bono M.R. Barros L.F. Lagos R. Microcin E492, a channel-forming bacteriocin from Klebsiella pneumoniae, induces apoptosis in some human cell lines.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 2696-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and interestingly, the degree of toxicity is dependent upon the size of polymers; oligomers are highly toxic for both bacteria and eukaryotic cells, and large fibrillar structures are little or non-toxic (13Bieler S. Estrada L. Lagos R. Baeza M. Castilla J. Soto C. Amyloid formation modulates the biological activity of a bacterial protein.J. Biol.

The latter is analogous to the widely accepted view in the field of protein misfolding disorders that soluble oligomers are the culprits of cell dysfunction, tissue damage, and disease, and the formation of large fibrils is likely a protective mechanism to encapsulate the toxic species (15Caughey B. Lansbury P.T. Protofibrils, pores, fibrils, and neurodegeneration. Separating the responsible protein aggregates from the innocent bystanders.Annu. Rev.

Here we hypothesize that fibrils sequester toxic species of Mcc that could be released in the medium upon changing environmental conditions. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the stability of Mcc fibrils by changing three different conditions: pH, ionic strength, and dilution. The results indicate that in vitro or in vivo polymerized Mcc fibrils disaggregate into soluble species at basic pH (≥8.5), at low NaCl concentrations (≤50 mm), and upon dilution (10-fold). The released species were highly toxic to the bacterial cells. We also provide evidence that soluble proteins released from fibrils upon disaggregation are able to reassemble into mature fibrils, suggesting that the process of fibril formation and dissolution is highly dynamic and reversible. Our findings suggest that Mcc fibrils work as a reservoir of releasable toxic species. These results may have important consequences to understand microbial homeostasis in the natural ecosystem and might be extrapolated to the behavior of disease associated amyloid aggregates. Chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Mcc was purified from the culture supernatants as described earlier (13Bieler S. Estrada L. Lagos R. Baeza M. Castilla J. Soto C. Amyloid formation modulates the biological activity of a bacterial protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26880-26885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In brief, Escherichia coli VCS257 cells harboring pJEM15 plasmid were grown in M9 minimal medium containing 0.2% glucose, 0.2% sodium citrate, 1 g/liter casamino acid, 1 mg/liter thiamine, and 100 mg/liter ampicillin to an absorbance of 1.2 at 600 nm at 37 °C with shaking. Bacterial cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 10 min. The resultant supernatant was passed through a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (Waters). The cartridge was sequentially washed with 65% methanol and 25% acetonitrile. Finally, the bound Mcc was eluted with 50% acetonitrile and lyophilized. Lyophilized powder of Mcc was stored at −20 °C until used. Under these conditions, the preparation contains highly purified Mcc (>90%) as evaluated by silver-stained gels (16Wray W. Boulikas T. Wray V.P. Hancock R. Silver staining of proteins in polyacrylamide gels.Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2501) Google Scholar). To start Mcc aggregation, lyophilized Mcc powder was dissolved in sterile 10 mm NaOH solution and filtered through a 30-kDa cutoff filter to remove aggregates. The protein concentration in the filtrate (considered as monomers) was estimated by the BCA assay kit (Pierce) and used immediately or stored frozen at −80 °C. To prepare fibrils of Mcc, soluble protein was incubated at a concentration of 400 μg/ml in aggregation buffer (50 mm PIPES-NaOH, pH 6.5, 0.5 m NaCl) for 24 h at 37 °C with vigorous shaking. Fibril formation was characterized by thioflavin T (ThT) binding assay, turbidity, sedimentation assay, dot blots, size-exclusion chromatography, and electron microscopy. For disaggregation of Mcc aggregates, fibrils formed after 24 h of incubation in aggregation buffer at 37 °C were centrifuged at 16,500 × g for 10 min. Then, preformed fibrils were treated for 2 h at 25 °C under three different conditions as follows: First, fibrils were incubated in buffers of different pH. Fibrils (400 μg/ml) were resuspended in the following buffers: 50 mm glycine, pH 2.5; 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5; 50 mm PIPES, pH 6.5; 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 8.5, and 9.5; 50 mm sodium borate, pH 10.5 or 0.1% NH4OH, pH 10.5 (in some cases where lyophilization was required). Each of these solutions contained 500 mm NaCl. Second, fibrils were incubated in buffers with different NaCl concentrations. Fibrils (400 μg/ml) were resuspended in 50 mm PIPES, pH 6.5, containing 0, 50, 150, 500, 750, and 1000 mm NaCl. 3). Third, the samples were submitted to different dilutions. Fibrils (400 μg/ml) were disaggregated upon dilutions (1-, 5,- and 10-fold) in 50 mm PIPES-NaOH, pH 6.5, containing 500 mm NaCl. After 2 h of incubation with the new condition, samples were either used as such for turbidity assay, electron microscopy, and cytotoxicity studies, or samples were centrifuged at 16,500 × g for 10 min, and supernatants were used for dot blot analysis and protein estimation by a BCA protein assay kit. In all cases, untreated Mcc fibrils (control) were used in 50 mm PIPES, pH 6.5, containing 500 mm NaCl. Fibrils (400 μg/ml) were allowed to disaggregate by diluting 10-fold in 50 mm sodium borate, pH 10.5, 0 mm NaCl for 2 h at 25 °C. After incubation, sample was centrifuged at 16,500 × g for 10 min. The resultant soluble protein in supernatant was concentrated. For reassembly, concentrated protein was diluted in aggregation buffer to a final concentration of 400 μg/ml and incubated at 37 °C with vigorous shaking for 48 h. For seeding aggregation of fresh Mcc, fresh soluble Mcc (400 μg/ml) was incubated at 37 °C for 48 h either alone or with 20 or 40 μg/ml seed (released soluble protein from fibrils upon treatment at pH 10.5, 0 mm NaCl, and dilution 10-fold). Aliquots were removed at different time points, and ThT assay was carried out as described below. VCS257 cells harboring pJEM15 were grown in M9 medium as described above at 37 °C for 48 h. Cells were removed by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 10 min. Then, culture supernatants were centrifuged at 16,500 × g for 10 min. Pellet-containing Mcc fibrils were washed 2 times with aggregation buffer (50 mm PIPES, pH 6.5, containing 500 mm NaCl). The concentration of the fibrils was measured by the BCA assay kit. Disaggregation of in vivo polymerized Mcc fibrils was carried out in a similar manner as described for Mcc fibrils polymerized in vitro from purified soluble Mcc (see above). Sedimentation was used to examine the extent of Mcc aggregation or Mcc fibrils disaggregation. After the aggregation or disaggregation experiments, samples were centrifuged at 16,500 × g for 10 min. Soluble proteins in the supernatant were collected in fresh tubes. The amount of Mcc in the supernatant was estimated by dot blot analysis, as described below. Total protein concentration in supernatants was estimated by the BCA assay kit. Five μl of each reaction was spotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences) and air-dried for 30 min at room temperature. Membranes were blocked with 5% w/v nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20 (TBS-T, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20) at room temperature for 2 h. After blocking, the membranes were probed with anti-Mcc antibody (1:3000) and the anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5000). The blots were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence plus Western blotting detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). The amount of Mcc aggregates under various conditions was also assessed by turbidity assay. For that, the turbidity of each sample was monitored by measuring absorbance at 340 nm using UV-visible spectrometer (U-3900, HITACHI, Japan). In all cases, corresponding buffer solutions were used as blanks. The kinetic of Mcc fibril formation was monitored by ThT binding assay as described (13Bieler S. Estrada L. Lagos R. Baeza M. Castilla J. Soto C. Amyloid formation modulates the biological activity of a bacterial protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26880-26885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Mcc (400 μg/ml) was allowed to aggregate in 50 mm PIPES (pH 6.5) containing 500 mm NaCl at 37 °C with vigorous shaking for different times. At the end of the reaction, 20 μl of the reaction mixture was mixed with 80 μl of 6 μm ThT in 1× phosphate buffered saline solution, and fluorescence was measured immediately at excitation 435 nm and emission of 485 nm using a microplate spectrofluoremeter Gemini-XS (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). An aliquot of 10 μl of reaction sample was placed onto Formvar-coated 200-mesh copper grids for 5 min, washed at least 3 times with distilled water, and then negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate for 1 min. Grids were examined by electron microscopy (H-7600, Hitachi, Japan) operated at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV. The sizes of Mcc species formed during Mcc aggregation (400 μg/ml in 50 mm PIPES-NaOH, pH 6.5, 500 mm NaCl at 37 °C) and upon disaggregation of Mcc fibrils (400 μg/ml after diluting10-fold in 0.1% NH4OH, pH 10.5, 0 mm NaCl at 25 °C) were analyzed by SEC. Aliquots were removed at various time points from Mcc aggregation reaction and from Mcc fibrils disaggregation reaction. All aliquots were centrifuged at 16,500 × g for 10 min to remove big aggregates, and soluble material in supernatants were subjected to SEC on a Superdex 200 10/300 GL (Amersham Biosciences) column using aggregation buffer (50 mm PIPES-NaOH, pH 6.5, 0.5 m NaCl) as the liquid phase at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min at room temperature. The elution profiles were detected by absorbance at 280 nm. A molecular mass standard curve was constructed by measuring elution times of: thyroglobulin, 669 kDa; ferritin, 440 kDa; aldolase, 158 kDa; conalbumin, 75 kDa; ovalbumin, 44 kDa (all from Amersham Biosciences). Soluble Mcc species formed during Mcc aggregation and upon disaggregation of Mcc fibrils were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. Samples were resolved by NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen). Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were blocked with 5% w/v nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline, Tween 20 (TBS-T) at room temperature for 2 h. After blocking, the membranes were probed with anti-Mcc antibody (1:3000) and the anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5000). The blots were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence plus Western blotting detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). E. coli BL21(DE3)p11α2 cells were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium at 37 °C to an absorbance (A600) of 0.5–0.6. The cell suspension was diluted to an A600 of 0.001 (∼5 × 105 colony-forming units/ml) in LB medium. Aliquots of 20 μl from untreated Mcc fibrils and Mcc fibrils treated at varying conditions as described above were withdrawn and mixed with 180 μl (from ∼5 × 105 colony-forming units /ml) of cell suspension. Tubes were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h without shaking. Cytotoxic effects of untreated and treated Mcc fibrils were evaluated by measuring bacterial growing through the absorbance at 600 nm using an Eppendorf Biophotometer. Before starting disaggregation experiments it is important to have a well characterized preparation of Mcc amyloid fibrils. To obtain seed-free Mcc protein, lyophilized Mcc was resuspended in 10 mm NaOH and filtered through a 30-kDa cutoff. To prepare Mcc fibrils, soluble Mcc was incubated at 37 °C with shaking in 50 mm PIPES, pH 6.5, containing 500 mm NaCl. Aliquots were removed at different time points, and aggregation was determined by ThT binding assay (Fig. 1A), sedimentation assay followed by dot blotting (Fig. 1B), and electron microscopy (Fig. 1C). ThT binding assay showed a time-dependent increase in ThT fluorescence. Similarly a time-dependent decrease in the amount of soluble Mcc in the supernatant was observed by dot blot after sedimentation (Fig. 1B). Disappearance of soluble Mcc in the supernatant correlated with an increase in ThT fluorescence, suggesting the formation of β-sheet-rich aggregates able to bind to ThT. Electron microscopy of unaggregated sample (0 h) did not show any detectable structures. After 3 h of incubation, a scarce amount of small oligomers with diameters of ∼2–30 nm could be observed (Fig. 1C). The quantity of these structures was higher after 6 h of incubation, in which some of the oligomers presented a larger size (∼60 nm). Sample incubated for 9–12 h showed the predominant presence of ∼100–300-nm long protofibrillar structures (Fig. 1C). Finally, after 24–48 h of incubation, samples were enriched in bundles of classical unbranched amyloid fibrils of variable length. In our previously published study we have shown that these structures are rich in β-sheet secondary structure and resistant to proteolytic degradation (13Bieler S. Estrada L. Lagos R. Baeza M.

We also reported a greater response of Hsp70 treatment when activated versus nonactivated T cells were used. This effect of Hsp70 was similar for all tested populations of T cells that included CD3+, CD4+, or CD8+.

https://openalex.org/W1975311766,"The interaction of transcription factors with specific DNA sequences is critical for activation of gene expression programs. In endothelial cells (EC), the transcription factor NF-κB is important in the switch from quiescence to activation, and is tightly controlled to avoid excessive inflammation and organ damage. Here we describe a novel mechanism that controls the activation of NF-κB in EC. The transcription factor Erg, the most highly expressed ETS member in resting EC, controls quiescence by repressing proinflammatory gene expression. Focusing on intercellular adhesion molecule 1(ICAM)-1 as a model, we identify two ETS binding sites (EBS -118 and -181) within the ICAM-1 promoter required for Erg-mediated repression. We show that Erg binds to both EBS -118 and EBS -181, the latter located within the NF-κB binding site. Interestingly, inhibition of Erg expression in quiescent EC results in increased NF-κB-dependent ICAM-1 expression, indicating that Erg represses basal NF-κB activity. Erg prevents NF-κB p65 from binding to the ICAM-1 promoter, suggesting a direct mechanism of interference. Gene set enrichment analysis of transcriptome profiles of Erg and NF-κB-dependent genes, together with chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies, reveals that this mechanism is common to other proinflammatory genes, including cIAP-2 and IL-8. These results identify a role for Erg as a gatekeeper controlling vascular inflammation, thus providing an important barrier to protect against inappropriate endothelial activation."

This finding suggests that the Raf-ERK-MAPK pathway mediates the signal between c-MET activation and EMT induction in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines.CMTM8 (chemokine-like factor-like MARVEL transmembrane domain-containing 8) belongs to the CMTM family, which consists of nine members: chemokine-like factor-1 and CMTM1–8 (1Pramanik R.

The CMTM8 gene encodes two isoforms. Generally, the longer isoform is the predominant isoform expressed in human cell lines (28Salvi A. Arici B. Portolani N. Giulini S.M. De Petro G. Barlati S.

The longer isoform promotes EGF receptor (EGFR) internalization and attenuates EGFR-mediated signaling for cell growth (29Jin C. Ding P. Wang Y. Ma D. Regulation of EGF receptor signaling by the MARVEL domain-containing protein CKLFSF8.FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 6375-6382Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). When overexpressed, both isoforms induce apoptosis in multiple tumor cell lines (30Li D. Jin C. Yin C. Zhang Y. Pang B. Tian L. Han W. Ma D. Wang Y. An alternative splice form of CMTM8 induces apoptosis.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2007; 39: 2107-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 31Jin C. Wang Y. Han W. Zhang Y. He Q. Li D. Yin C.

Physiol. 2007; 211: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In this work, unless specifically described, CMTM8 refers to both isoforms.In this study, we demonstrate that down-regulation of CMTM8 in HepG2 cells causes EMT-like phenotypic changes that are blocked by chemical MEK inhibition or ERK2 knockdown. We found that c-MET was a main contributor to the EMT-like phenotype, as inhibition of c-MET signaling with the small molecule inhibitor SU11274 or c-MET RNAi suppressed the acquisition of an EMT-like phenotype following CMTM8 knockdown. Moreover, when CMTM8 expression was reduced, the protein levels of c-MET, both on the surface and in cells, were elevated, and HGF-induced c-MET/ERK signaling was enhanced and sustained. Transient overexpression of the longer CMTM8 isoform antagonized HGF-induced cell scattering and decreased the motility of HepG2 cells toward HGF, accompanied by inhibition of c-MET/ERK signaling. Together, these findings suggest that CMTM8 functions as a negative regulator of HGF/c-MET signaling to ERK and hence may be a useful target for treatment of cancers with aberrant activation of this pathway.DISCUSSIONOur studies show that down-regulation of CMTM8 results in morphological and molecular changes that resemble EMT. These changes require enhanced c-MET and ERK signaling.Unlike the results obtained with expression of activated RasV12, CMTM8 knockdown did not elevate the expression of α-smooth muscle actin (data not shown), which is a mesenchymal marker reported for EMT in hepatocyte-originated cell models (35Lahsnig C. Mikula M. Petz M. Zulehner G. Schneller D. van Zijl F. Huber H. Csiszar A. Beug H. Mikulits W. ILEI requires oncogenic Ras for the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of hepatocytes and liver carcinoma progression.Oncogene. 2009; 28: 638-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This difference may be due to incomplete knockdown with the available CMTM8 siRNAs, which are not capable of maintaining full knockdown during the course of extended EMT experiments. Because we could not determine whether the partial EMT phenotype (increased cell motility with a change in some EMT markers) that we observed is due to partial CMTM8 knockdown or if complete CMTM8 loss would generate the same phenotype, we describe the morphological and biochemical changes as EMT-like.We have shown that the EMT-like phenotype induced by CMTM8 knockdown is mediated mainly by ERK (but not AKT) signaling. Although ERK and AKT are both downstream effectors of Ras, it has been demonstrated that the ERK (but not PI3K-AKT) pathway mediates the induction of EMT by oncogenic Ras (15Janda E. Lehmann K. Killisch I. Jechlinger M. Herzig M. Downward J. Beug H. Grünert S. Ras and TGFβ cooperatively regulate epithelial cell plasticity and metastasis: dissection of Ras signaling pathways.J.

However, it is important to note that although knockdown of ERK2 indicates an important requirement of ERK2 signaling, ERK2 overexpression, specifically ERK2-D319N overexpression, generated a less pronounced EMT phenotype than RasV12. We have observed similar results in MCF-10A breast epithelial cells for ERK2 signaling via DEF motifs (16Shin S. Dimitri C.A. Yoon S.O. Dowdle W. Blenis J.

However, in this study, we found that CMTM8 regulation of c-MET (not EGFR) was the main contributor to the EMT-like phenotypic alterations observed after CMTM8 knockdown in HepG2 cells. Similarly, in MCF-10A cells, an EGFR-dependent cell line, EGF stimulation did not induce visible morphological changes consistent with EMT, and AG1478 failed to block the EMT-like morphological change induced by CMTM8 knockdown (data not shown). Thus, although CMTM8 regulation of EGFR internalization may control cell survival (29Jin C. Ding P. Wang Y. Ma D. Regulation of EGF receptor signaling by the MARVEL domain-containing protein CKLFSF8.FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 6375-6382Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), its regulation of c-MET is likely to contribute to the control of cell motility and invasion.c-MET signaling promotes invasive growth and can drive cancer malignancy (41Trusolino L.

In vitro studies have revealed that c-MET positively regulates invasion and migration of hepatocellular carcinoma cells, as well as other types of cancer cell lines (28Salvi A. Arici B. Portolani N.

This study suggests that in addition to c-MET amplification and activating mutations, CMTM8 down-regulation is an additional mechanism by which tumors can induce c-MET signaling. Future studies on the inverse correlation between CMTM8 and c-MET expression in different tumor types will determine whether CMTM8 expression can be used as a biomarker to classify tumors most likely to respond to anti-c-MET therapeutics. CMTM8 could also be used as a potential therapeutic target of tumors with hyperactive c-MET/ERK signaling.

During EMT, a transcriptionally induced program causes a reduction in the differentiated epithelial cell characteristics, including cell-cell adhesion and apical-basal polarity. The program induces mesenchymal cell characteristics, including increased motility and invasiveness and a heightened resistance to apoptosis (2Thiery J.P. Acloque H. Huang R.Y.

The DEF (docking site for ERK, FXF) motif and D-domain (docking domain) are found within ERK1/2 interactors and promote ERK interaction with and phosphorylation of substrates. ERK1/2 interactors containing only DEF motifs, D-domains, or a combination of the two motifs have been described, thus allowing for intricate regulation of downstream biological processes (17Murphy L.O.

ERK contains a DEF motif-binding pocket and a common D-domain that bind DEF motifs and D-domains, respectively. Single point mutations on the ERK2 DEF motif-binding pocket or the ERK2 common D-domain can impair the signaling to DEF motif- or D-domain-containing interactors of ERK2, respectively, without greatly affecting its overall kinase activity (19Dimitri C.A.

This finding suggests that the Raf-ERK-MAPK pathway mediates the signal between c-MET activation and EMT induction in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines.CMTM8 (chemokine-like factor-like MARVEL transmembrane domain-containing 8) belongs to the CMTM family, which consists of nine members: chemokine-like factor-1 and CMTM1–8 (1Pramanik R.

The longer isoform promotes EGF receptor (EGFR) internalization and attenuates EGFR-mediated signaling for cell growth (29Jin C. Ding P. Wang Y. Ma D.

When overexpressed, both isoforms induce apoptosis in multiple tumor cell lines (30Li D. Jin C. Yin C. Zhang Y. Pang B. Tian L. Han W. Ma D. Wang Y.

In this work, unless specifically described, CMTM8 refers to both isoforms.In this study, we demonstrate that down-regulation of CMTM8 in HepG2 cells causes EMT-like phenotypic changes that are blocked by chemical MEK inhibition or ERK2 knockdown. We found that c-MET was a main contributor to the EMT-like phenotype, as inhibition of c-MET signaling with the small molecule inhibitor SU11274 or c-MET RNAi suppressed the acquisition of an EMT-like phenotype following CMTM8 knockdown. Moreover, when CMTM8 expression was reduced, the protein levels of c-MET, both on the surface and in cells, were elevated, and HGF-induced c-MET/ERK signaling was enhanced and sustained. Transient overexpression of the longer CMTM8 isoform antagonized HGF-induced cell scattering and decreased the motility of HepG2 cells toward HGF, accompanied by inhibition of c-MET/ERK signaling. Together, these findings suggest that CMTM8 functions as a negative regulator of HGF/c-MET signaling to ERK and hence may be a useful target for treatment of cancers with aberrant activation of this pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2050455358,"The E3 ubiquitin ligase, MDM2, uses a dual-site mechanism to ubiquitinate and degrade the tumor suppressor protein p53, involving interactions with the N-terminal hydrophobic pocket and the acidic domain of MDM2. The results presented here demonstrate that MDM2 also uses this same dual-site mechanism to bind to the cell fate determinant NUMB with both the N-terminal hydrophobic pocket and the acidic domain of MDM2 also involved in forming the interaction with NUMB. Furthermore, the acidic domain interactions are crucial for MDM2-mediated ubiquitination of NUMB. Contrary to p53, where two separate domains form the interface with MDM2, only one region within the phosphotyrosine binding domain of NUMB (amino acids 113-148) mediates binding to both these regions of MDM2. By binding to both domains on MDM2, NUMB disrupts the MDM2-p53 complex and MDM2-catalyzed ubiquitination of p53. Therefore, we have identified the mechanism NUMB uses to regulate the steady-state levels of the p53 in cells. By targeting the acidic domain of MDM2 using acid domain-binding ligands we can overcome MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of NUMB impacting on the stabilization of p53 in cells. Furthermore, delivery of MDM2 acid domain-binding ligands to cancer cells promotes p53-dependent growth arrest and the induction of apoptosis. This highlights the dual-site mechanism of MDM2 on another physiological substrate and identifies the acid domain as well as N terminus as a potential target for small molecules that inhibit MDM2."

In eukaryotic cells, genomic DNA is organized into chromatin that encodes epigenetic information and governs genome stability. The basic unit of chromatin is the nucleosome consisting of 147 bp of DNA wrapped around a histone octamer, containing a (H3-H4)2 tetramer and two H2A-H2B dimers (1Allis C.D. Jenuwein T. Reinberg D.

Edayathumangalam R.S. Bao Y. Park Y.J. Luger K. Nucleosome structure and function.Ernst Schering Res. Found Workshop. 2006; 57: 29-46Crossref Google Scholar). During S phase of the cell cycle, chromatin structures must be propagated to daughter cells to maintain gene expression states and genome integrity. DNA replication-coupled nucleosome assembly plays an important role in formation of nucleosomes, one of the early steps in the inheritance of higher chromatin structure (4Ransom M. Dennehey B.K. Tyler J.K. Chaperoning histones during DNA replication and repair.Cell. 2010; 140: 183-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 5Smith S. Stillman B.

Chromatin assembly during SV40 DNA replication in vitro.Cell. 1986; 45: 555-565Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Because nucleosomal H2A-H2B dimers can exchange with free H2A-H2B dimers in cells, it is believed that the assembly of H3-H4 tetramers following DNA replication is the critical and rate-limiting step in nucleosome formation (7Das C. Tyler J.K. Churchill M.E. The histone shuffle: histone chaperones in an energetic dance.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2010; 35: 476-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Immediately following DNA replication both the transfer of parental H3-H4 and deposition of newly synthesized H3-H4 onto replicated DNA are important to promote nucleosome formation. Early studies of parental histone transfer suggested that during DNA replication, parental nucleosomes tended to be distributed to nascent daughter DNA intact without mixing with newly synthesized H3-H4 (8Leffak I.M. Grainger R. Weintraub H. Conservative assembly and segregation of nucleosomal histones.Cell. 1977; 12: 837-845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 9Jackson V. Chalkley R. A new method for the isolation of replicative chromatin: selective deposition of histone on both new and old DNA.Cell. 1981; 23: 121-134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). However, later studies showed that parental and newly synthesized histones associate with each other, forming hybrid nucleosomes, such as parental H3-H4 heterotetramers forming a complex with newly synthesized H2A-H2B and vice versa (10Russev G. Hancock R. Formation of hybrid nucleosomes containing new and old histones.Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 4129-4137Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that histone chaperone Asf1, which is involved in both replication-coupled nucleosome assembly as well as replication-independent nucleosome assembly, binds H3-H4 dimers (11English C.M. Adkins M.W. Carson J.J. Churchill M.E. Tyler J.K.

Based on these results, it was hypothesized that a parental (H3-H4)2 tetramer could be split into two H3-H4 dimers, which would then associate with newly synthesized H3-H4 dimers or with other parental H3-H4 dimers to form nucleosomes with mixed (H3-H4)2 tetramers, respectively (13Probst A.V. Dunleavy E. Almouzni G. Epigenetic inheritance during the cell cycle.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 192-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). More recently, work in mammalian cells demonstrated that during replication-coupled nucleosome assembly parental (H3-H4)2 tetramers were not split. Only a very small fraction of H3.3-H4 tetramers (which are in general deposited through the replication-independent nucleosome assembly pathway) did split and formed hybrid nucleosomes (14Han J.

The reason for the differences seen in these studies is unclear. Importantly, the form of the newly synthesized H3-H4 molecules (dimer or tetramer) deposited onto DNA was not addressed. It is generally thought that newly synthesized H3-H4 dimers first form a complex with Asf1 (15Jasencakova Z. Scharf A.N. Ask K. Corpet A. Imhof A. Almouzni G. Groth A. Replication stress interferes with histone recycling and predeposition marking of new histones.Mol. Cell. 2010; 37: 736-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). This view is supported by structural studies, which reveals that Asf1 binds a H3-H4 dimer through the H3 interface involved in the formation of (H3-H4)2 tetramers (11English C.M. Adkins M.W.

In addition, in vitro studies indicate that Asf1 disrupts (H3-H4)2 tetramers. Given these results it remained unclear how (H3-H4)2 tetramers could be formed in the presence of Asf1. We and others have made several observations suggesting that H3-H4 dimers are transferred from the Asf1-H3-H4 complex to CAF-1 and Rtt106, two other histone H3-H4 chaperones promoting assembly of newly synthesized H3-H4 into nucleosomes in budding yeast. First, genetic and biochemical evidence indicates that a major function of Asf1 is to regulate acetylation of histone H3 lysine 56 (H3K56Ac) by presenting new H3-H4 to the lysine acetyltransferase Rtt109 for acetylation (14Han J.

Second, H3K56Ac enhances the binding of H3-H4 to Rtt106 and CAF-1 in vivo and in vitro. In addition, Rtt106 and CAF-1 (which also physically interact) are capable of depositing H3K56Ac-H4 onto replicating DNA in vitro (19Li Q. Zhou H. Wurtele H. Davies B. Horazdovsky B. Verreault A.

However, it is not known whether Rtt106 or CAF-1 binds a H3-H4 dimer like Asf1 or (H3-H4)2 tetramers. Here, we show that Rtt106 binds to a (H3-H4)2 tetramer in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Rtt106 undergoes homo-oligomerization in vivo, consistent with the homodimerization of Rtt106 N terminus demonstrated in vitro (20Su D. Hu Q. Li Q. Thompson J.R. Cui G. Fazly A. Davies B.A. Botuyan M.V. Zhang Z. Mer G.

Standard yeast genetics and molecular biology methods were utilized to generate yeast strains and plasmids listed in supplemental Tables 2 and 3. pET28MBP-RTT106 and pET28MBP-RTT106(1–301) were constructed by PCR-amplifying relevant regions using pZG175 and cloning into BamH1 and SalI sites of pET28MBP. RTT106 V21E, L28E, I30E, and F31E were generated by site-directed mutagenesis on pZG175 using the Gene Tailor site-directed mutagenesis system (Invitrogen). RTT106 V21E, L28E, I30E, and F31E ORFs were amplified by PCR and subcloned into pET28b. Either HHT1 or HHT2 was tagged with HA epitope in the W303 background, and haploid HA-tagged H3-expressing strains were back-crossed with parental W303 haploids two times (21Longtine M.S. McKenzie 3rd, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R.

PCR-amplified HHT1–3HA-HHF1 DNA was digested with EcoRI and BglII and subcloned into the BamHI-EcoRI fragment of pRS416 (for primer list, see supplemental Table 1). Protein expressions were performed either in Sf9 cells using the Bac2Bac system (Invitrogen) or BL21 (DE3) bacterial strain. Plasmids were expressed in DH5α, and bacterial cultures were induced with 0.5 mm IPTG for 14–20 h at 27 °C. Following lysis in buffer A (PBS) recombinant His fusion proteins protein was purified by Ni-affinity chromatography. Following elution with a buffer B (PBS with a gradient of 0–500 mm imidazole), proteins were subjected to gel filtration analysis in a Superose 6 gel filtration column. Yeast cells with Rtt106-TAP 3The abbreviations used are: TAPtandem affinity purificationTEVtobacco etch virusCPTcamptothecin. were grown in liquid YPD medium up to 1.8–2.0 A600/ml, pelleted, and washed with water containing 10% glycerol and resuspended in IP buffer (25 mm Tris pH8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm Pefabloc, 15 Kunitz units/ml DNase I). The TAP tag was fused to the C terminus of Rtt106 as described (22Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Séraphin B.

To facilitate the expression of Rtt106-TAP, Rtt106-TAP containing the endogenous promoter of Rtt106 was cloned into a pRS313 plasmid. Cell suspension was flash frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C until use. Cells were lysed at cryogenic conditions using a 6770 Freezer/Mill grinder (SamplePrep). Powdered cell suspension was allowed to thaw on ice. Liquified cell lysate was spun at 20,000 × g on a JA-25.5 rotor on an Avanti J-E centrifuge (Beckman Coulter). Soluble portion was incubated on ice for 30 min with 75 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Lysate were spun at 14,000 × g on a Microfuge 22R centrifuge (Beckman Coulter). The cleared lysate were again spun at 14,000 × g. The cleared lysate was incubated with washed IgG beads for 2 h at 4 °C. Following extensive washing, proteins were eluted by digestion with TEV protease for 2 h at 16 °C. One third of the total volume of the eluate was precipitated with 10% TCA and boiled in sample buffer. The remainder of the TEV eluate (2/3 volume of original eluate) was allowed to incubate with HA beads for 2 h at 4 °C. Collected flow-through was TCA-precipitated and boiled in sample buffer. The HA beads were washed three times with IP buffer and boiled in the SDS sample buffer. Western blotting analysis was carried out with antibodies for calmodulin-binding peptide, H3K56Ac, HA, and H3. Antibodies against calmodulin-binding peptide were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Antibodies against H3K56Ac and H3 were made in the laboratory (23Zhou H. Madden B.J. Muddiman D.C. Zhang Z.

To determine how Rtt106 bound to H3K56R mutant in the presence of wild-type H3, yeast cells were grown to 1 A600/ml, pelleted, and washed with water containing 10% glycerol and resuspended in IP buffer. Cell suspension was flash frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C until use. Lysis was performed under cryogenic condition using the Freezer/Mill grinder, and tandem affinity purification was carried out as described previously (19Li Q. Zhou H. Wurtele H. Davies B.

The assay to test in vivo oligomerization, H3-H4 binding ability of wild-type and mutant Rtt106 was performed with cells grown to 1.4 A600/ml, and IgG binding followed by TEV cleavage and binding to CaM beads were performed as described previously. Measurement of the expression of the GFP transgene integrated at the HMR locus using FACS was used to assay for silencing at the HMR locus. Exponentially growing cells expressing wild-type or mutant Rtt106-TAP in cac1Δ rtt106Δ double mutant background as well as a strain deleted for sir3 (Δsir3) were used in this analysis as described previously (24Huang S.

The DNA damage sensitivity assays were performed using 10-fold serial dilutions of exponentially growing cells that were spotted on camptothecin (CPT) containing HIS dropout (−HIS SCM) plates as described previously (19Li Q.

A novel role for histone chaperones CAF-1 and Rtt106p in heterochromatin silencing.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2274-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, the molecular form (heterotetramer or heterodimer) of the H3-H4 that binds to Rtt106 was not known. Because Rtt106 appears to bind a surface of H3 that is distinct from the surface bound by Asf1 and Asf1 is known to bind a H3-H4 dimer (19Li Q. Zhou H. Wurtele H. Davies B. Horazdovsky B. Verreault A. Zhang Z. Acetylation of histone H3 lysine 56 regulates replication-coupled nucleosome assembly.Cell. 2008; 134: 244-255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), we set out to determine whether Rtt106 bound to a H3-H4 heterodimer (H3-H4) or a heterotetramer (H3-H4)2, using sequential affinity purification. The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has two histone genes, HHT1 and HHT2, that encode identical proteins. In a strain expressing Rtt106-TAP, either HHT1 or HHT2 was modified to encode H3 C-terminally tagged with three HA epitopes (H3-HA) whereas the other genes remained unmodified. This resulted in the expression of both the tagged H3-HA and untagged H3 in each strain. The tagged and untagged H3 species were distinguished from each other in Western blots by the difference in migration because of the added molecular mass of the HA tags (Fig. 1A). The sequential affinity purification procedure involved an initial purification of Rtt106-TAP using IgG beads followed by affinity purification of H3-HA using anti-HA antibody-conjugated beads (Fig. 1B). If the sequential affinity purification of Rtt106-TAP and H3-HA resulted in purification of only H3-HA, that would suggest that Rtt106 binds to an H3-H4 heterodimer. However, if untagged H3 were co-purified with tagged H3-HA, that would be consistent with Rtt106 binding to a (H3-H4)2 heterotetramer (see “Discussion”). As expected, the initial IgG purification resulted in co-purification of both tagged and untagged H3 with Rtt106 (Fig. 1C). This eluate was then subjected to affinity purification of H3-HA using HA antibody-conjugated beads (Fig. 1C). Untagged H3 as well as Rtt106 co-purified with H3-HA (Fig. 1C), suggesting that H3-H4 co-purified with Rtt106 may be a (H3-H4)2 heterotetramer. Because Rtt106 forms an oligomer (see below), another possible explanation for co-purification of H3-H4 with H3-HA-H4 shown in Fig. 1 was that the H3-H4 dimer and the H3-HA-H4 dimer bound to different subunits of an Rtt106 oligomer. To test this possibility, we asked whether Rtt106 bound to H3K56R mutant in the presence or absence of a wild-type H3. We have shown that H3K56Ac increases the binding of H3-H4 to Rtt106 in vivo and in vitro. Mutating the lysine 56 of H3 to arginine (H3K56R) significantly reduces the binding of H3-H4 to Rtt106 (19Li Q. Zhou H. Wurtele H. Davies B. Horazdovsky B. Verreault A. Zhang Z. Acetylation of histone H3 lysine 56 regulates replication-coupled nucleosome assembly.Cell. 2008; 134: 244-255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). If a H3-H4 heterodimer and a H3-HA-H4 heterodimer bound to different subunit of an Rtt106 oligomer, one would not expect Rtt106 to bind to H3K56R even in the presence of wild-type H3. However, if Rtt106 bound a H3-H4 heterotetramer, H3K56R that was associated with wild-type H3 as part of a tetramer could co-purify with Rtt106 in the presence of a wild-type of H3. Therefore, H3-HA was expressed in cells co-expressing either untagged wild-type H3 or H3K56R. Rtt106-TAP was purified from these strains, and co-purified H3 was detected by Western blotting using antibodies against H3 or H3K56Ac. As reported, Rtt106 binding to H3K56R was barely detectable when H3K56R was the only copy of H3 in cells. Remarkably, significantly more H3K56R was co-purified with Rtt106 in the presence of wild-type H3-HA (Fig. 2). These results strongly support the conclusion that Rtt106 binds a (H3-H4)2 heterotetramer in vivo. In the course of recombinant Rtt106 purification, full-length Rtt106 appeared to migrate through a gel filtration column at an apparent molecular mass (>450 kDa) much larger than the calculated molecular mass of 52 kDa. This led us to hypothesize that Rtt106 might form oligomers and/or exist with an elongated shape in solution. To discern between these possibilities further, a recombinant Rtt106 protein (amino acids 1–301) lacking its C terminus was subjected to gel filtration chromatography. From multiple purifications, the migration of Rtt106(1–301) consistently corresponds to a molecular mass intermediate between that of a dimer and a trimer (Fig. 3A and data not shown). This observation agrees well with a homodimer of elongated shape as expected from structural studies of N-terminal and middle domains of Rtt106. In addition, dynamic light-scattering analysis shows that Rtt106(1–301 and 1–315) are close to a dimerized state (data not shown). When a Rtt106 mutant (containing residues 67–301) lacking both N-terminal 66 residues and its C terminus was subjected to the same analysis, the migration was consistent with the expected molecular mass of ∼27 kDa (Fig. 3A). This result supports the conclusion that Rtt106 undergoes oligomerization in vitro. The apparently much higher than expected molecular mass of full-length Rtt106 may be due to further oligomerization through the C terminus. Alternatively, the disordered nature of Rtt106 C terminus may cause anomalous migration in gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 3A). To determine whether Rtt106 undergoes oligomerization in vivo, we asked whether exogenously expressed Rtt106-TAP bound to endogenous Rtt106. Rtt106-TAP expressed from a plasmid was purified from cells containing endogenous Rtt106 and co-purified proteins was detected by antibodies against Rtt106. Endogenous Rtt106 co-purified with Rtt106-TAP, indicating that Rtt106 can form oligomers in vivo (Fig. 3B and data not shown). In addition, Rtt106 mutant(1–315) lacking the C terminus bound to endogenous Rtt106 to a similar degree as wild-type Rtt106-TAP (Fig. 3B). These results strongly suggest that the N-terminal region of Rtt106 is sufficient to mediate oligomerization of Rtt106, presumably dimerization, in vivo. These data also suggest that Rtt106 does not oligomerize through its C terminus in vivo and that the C terminus contributes to the anomalous migration in gel filtration chromatography as indicated above. The NMR structure of the Rtt106 N terminus (residues 1–67) shows this region forms a tight homodimer (20Su D. Hu Q. Li Q. Thompson J.R. Cui G. Fazly A. Davies B.A. Botuyan M.V. Zhang Z. Mer G. Structural basis for recognition of H3K56-acetylated histone H3-H4 by the chaperone RH106.Nature. 2012; 483: 104-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), consistent with the results above indicating that the N terminus of Rtt106 is involved in Rtt106 oligomerization. Based on structural information, four residues (Val21, Leu28, Ile30, and Phe31) at the dimer interface were mutated to glutamic acid. These four Rtt106 N-terminal point mutants were expressed from plasmids as a Rtt106-TAP fusion in cells containing endogenous Rtt106 and subjected to tandem affinity purification to test for their ability to bind endogenous Rtt106. Co-purified proteins were detected by Western blotting using antibodies against Rtt106. Like wild-type Rtt106-TAP, two Rtt106 V21E and L28E mutants bound to endogenous Rtt106. In contrast, the Rtt106 I30E mutant showed significantly diminished association with endogenous Rtt106 compared with the wild type, and the binding of Rtt106 F31E mutant to endogenous Rtt106 was not detectable (Fig. 3C). These results strongly support the idea that Rtt106 can undergo homo-oligomerization in vivo, most likely homodimer, and the C terminus of Rtt106 appears not to have a role in promoting further oligomerization. Because Rtt106 I30E and F31E mutants also lost their ability to bind H3-H4 (see below), it is possible that the reduced association of these Rtt106 mutants with endogenous Rtt106 was due to a loss of the interaction between Rtt106 and H3-H4. To test this idea, we determined whether the association of Rtt106 with H3-H4 is required for Rtt106 oligomerization. Rtt106-TAP, expressed from a plasmid, was purified from cells expressing wild-type H3 and H3K56R. Rtt106-TAP bound to endogenous Rtt106 irrespective of the status of H3 in cells (Fig. 3D). These results suggest that the ability of Rtt106 to bind H3-H4 is not a prerequisite for Rtt106 to form oligomers and that inability of Rtt106 I30E and F31E mutants to bind endogenous Rtt106 is not due to loss of H3-H4 binding. Consistent with these in vivo data, full-length recombinant Rtt106 V21E and L28E mutant proteins migrated at apparent molecular masses comparable with the full-length wild-type Rtt106. In contrast, both I30E and F31E mutant Rtt106 proteins migrated at a molecular mass corresponding to between half and one third of that of wild-type Rtt106, consistent with loss or diminished dimerization through the N-terminal domain (Fig. 3E). Again, the molecular masses appear larger than expected most likely due to the anomalous migration caused by the Rtt106 C terminus. These results support that conclusion that both I30E and F31E mutations at the Rtt106 dimer interface compromise the formation of Rtt106 oligomers in vitro and in vivo. Rtt106 is a histone H3-H4 chaperone and binds CAF-1 (24Huang S. Zhou H. Katzmann D. Hochstrasser M. Atanasova E. Zhang Z.

Tarara J. Zhang Z. A novel role for histone chaperones CAF-1 and Rtt106p in heterochromatin silencing.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2274-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To understand the functional significance of Rtt106 oligomerization, we first determined how Rtt106 mutations at the N-terminal dimerization domain affect the ability of Rtt106 to bind H3-H4. To do this, wild-type Rtt106-TAP and N-terminal point mutants were expressed in rtt106Δ mutant cells. Tandem affinity purification was then performed, and purified proteins were detected by Western analysis. As expected, wild-type Rtt106 was able to bind H3-H4 efficiently. In addition, the V21E and L28E mutants retained the ability to bind H3-H4. However, the I30E and F31E mutants, which exhibited significant defects in oligomerization, were defective for H3-H4 binding. Finally, deletion of Cac1, the large subunit of CAF-1, had no apparent effect on the ability of Rtt106 to bind H3-H4 (Fig. 4B), suggesting that the Rtt106-CAF-1 interaction is not required for Rtt106 to bind H3-H4. Together, these results indicate that the N terminus of Rtt106, potentially through homodimerization, is important for its ability to bind H3-H4 in vivo (Fig. 4). Rtt106 functions in parallel with CAF-1 in transcriptional silencing (24Huang S. Zhou H. Katzmann D. Hochstrasser M. Atanasova E. Zhang Z. Rtt106p is a histone chaperone involved in heterochromatin-mediated silencing.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 13410-13415Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Cells lacking Rtt106 and Cac1 exhibit significant defects in transcriptional silencing at the HMR locus compared with cells lacking either Rtt106 or Cac1 alone. Therefore, we also tested whether the N terminus of Rtt106 was important for its role in transcriptional silencing. Wild-type and N-terminal point mutants were expressed in rtt106Δ cac1Δ double deletion cells carrying a GFP transgene integrated near the silent mating type locus HMR. The rtt106Δ cac1Δ double deletion resulted in the loss of silencing in the HMR locus and thus allowing increased expression of the GFP transgene. The reintroduction of wild-type Rtt106-TAP into this strain restored transcriptional silencing as measured by the percentage of GFP-expressing cells. Expression of Rtt106 mutants, V21E and L28E, also restored heterochromatin silencing, to a level similar to wild-type Rtt106. In contrast, expression of Rtt106 I30E and F31E in rtt106Δ cac1Δ double mutant cells failed to correct the silencing defects of these double mutant cells (Fig. 5A). Together, these results demonstrate that mutations at the dimer interface of the N terminus Rtt106 result in defects in transcriptional silencing at the HMR locus. Similarly, deletion of both rtt106 and cac1 together caused a decrease in viability following exposure to the DNA-damaging agent CPT that was much more severe than deletions of either gene individually (19Li Q. Zhou H. Wurtele H. Davies B. Horazdovsky B. Verreault A. Zhang Z.

Katzmann D. Hochstrasser M. Atanasova E. Zhang Z. Rtt106p is a histone chaperone involved in heterochromatin-mediated silencing.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 13410-13415Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We evaluated the sensitivity to genotoxic stress of either wild-type or mutant Rtt106 when expressed in cac1Δ rtt106Δ double mutant cells. Expression of the mutants V21E and L28E restored viability to rtt106Δ cac1Δ exposed to CPT to a level similar to that of expression of wild-type Rtt106. In contrast, expression of the I30E and F31E mutants continued to show increased sensitivity to CPT (Fig. 5B). Moreover, expression of Rtt106 mutant(1–315) lacking the C terminus also restored CPT sensitivity (Fig. 5C) and transcriptional silencing defects of cac1Δ rtt106Δ double mutant (data not shown). Thus, mutations at the N terminus of Rtt106 result in defects in transcriptional silencing and response to DNA-damaging agents, whereas deletion of the C terminus of Rtt106 has no apparent effect. These results are consistent with the results that the C terminus of Rtt106 is not required for the ability of Rtt106 to oligomerize in vivo (Fig. 3B). Taken together, we suggest that oligomerization of Rtt106, most likely a homodimer mediated by its N terminus, is important for the Rtt106 role in genotoxic stress and transcriptional silencing. Here, we present biochemical evidence that Rtt106 binds to a H3-H4 heterotetramer (H3-H4)2. This represents the first biochemical demonstration of a H3-H4 histone chaperone binding to a heterotetramer (H3-H4)2 in vivo. In addition, we have shown that Rtt106 is capable of undergoing homo-oligomerization in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, we show that oligomerization of Rtt106 is required for its efficient association with H3-H4 in vivo and its function in transcriptional silencing and resistance to the DNA-damaging agent CPT. It is known that the N terminus (residues 1–67) of Rtt106 forms a homo-dimer in solution (20Su D. Hu Q. Li Q. Thompson J.R. Cui G. Fazly A. Davies B.A. Botuyan M.V. Zhang Z. Mer G. Structural basis for recognition of H3K56-acetylated histone H3-H4 by the chaperone RH106.Nature. 2012; 483: 104-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We show here that the C terminus of Rtt106 is dispensable for the ability of Rtt106 to homo-oligomerize and for the Rtt106 function in transcriptional silencing and DNA damage response. Therefore, we suggest that Rtt106 functions as a homo-dimer in nucleosome assembly, transcriptional silencing, and DNA damage response. During DNA replication, H3-H4 molecules are assembled first followed by a rapid assembly of H2A-H2B. It is thought that deposition of H3-H4 onto DNA is a rate-limiting step during nucleosome assembly (3Chodaparambil J.V. Edayathumangalam R.S. Bao Y. Park Y.J. Luger K. Nucleosome structure and function.Ernst Schering Res. Found Workshop. 2006; 57: 29-46Crossref Google Scholar). Moreover, it is known that deposition of newly synthesized H3-H4 onto DNA requires histone chaperones including CAF-1, Asf1, and Rtt106 (4Ransom M. Dennehey B.K. Tyler J.K. Chaperoning histones during DNA replication and repair.Cell. 2010; 140: 183-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Biochemical and structural studies of Asf1 have shown that Asf1 binds to an H3-H4 heterodimer and is essential for acetylation of H3 lysine 56 (a mark for newly synthesized H3), suggesting that newly synthesized H3-H4 are heterodimers and associated with Asf1 (17Recht J. Tsubota T. Tanny J.C. Diaz R.L. Berger J.M. Zhang X. Garcia B.A. Shabanowitz J. Burlingame A.L. Hunt D.F. Kaufman P.D. Allis C.D. Histone chaperone Asf1 is required for histone H3 lysine 56 acetylation, a modification associated with S phase in mitosis and meiosis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 6988-6993Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Therefore, there are at least two possible models to explain how H3-H4 tetramers, the first building block of nucleosomes, are formed during de novo nucleosome assembly. H3-H4 tetramers are formed either through the sequential deposition of H3K56 acetylated H3-H4 heterodimers onto DNA or through assembly of H3-H4 heterotetramers on histone chaperones prior to deposition on DNA. Our observation that Rtt106 binds H3-H4 heterotetramers supports the hypothesis that newly synthesized H3-H4 heterotetramers are assembled on Rtt106 prior to deposition on the DNA. These observations also have implications on how parental H3-H4 molecules are segregated. Deposition of newly synthesized H3-H4 as a heterotetramer effectively prevents formation of mixed H3-H4 tetramers each containing a newly synthesized H3-H4 heterodimer and a parental H3-H4 heterodimer. Therefore, parental H3-H4 must also be deposited as heterotetramers during nucleosome assembly. It follows that for chromatin regions or nucleosome assembly processes where Rtt106 serves as the histone H3-H4 chaperone, it is likely that splitting of H3-H4 tetramers is not going to occur. Our results also show that Rtt106 undergoes homo-oligomerization in vivo. Noticeably, the truncated form of Rtt106(1–315), which retains full function in vivo, homo-oligomerizes via the very N-terminal region of Rtt106. Previous studies have shown that the middle domain of Rtt106, which shares sequence homology with the PH domain, is the site of H3-H4 binding in vivo and in vitro (19Li Q. Zhou H. Wurtele H. Davies B. Horazdovsky B. Verreault A. Zhang Z. Acetylation of histone H3 lysine 56 regulates replication-coupled nucleosome assembly.Cell. 2008; 134: 244-255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The fact that the inability of I30E and F31E mutations at the homo-dimer interface to bind H3-H4 in vivo correlates with the defects observed in oligomerization strongly supports the view that oligomerization of Rtt106, presumably dimerization, is required for Rtt106 to bind H3-H4 in vivo (Fig. 4). Finally, cells expressing these mutants display defects in transcriptional silencing at the HMR locus and sensitivity toward DNA-damaging agents. These results suggest that the physiologically relevant functional form of Rtt106 in vivo is the oligomeric form. Although it is not clear whether CAF-1, another histone H3-H4 chaperone, binds a H3-H4 heterodimer or a H3-H4 heterotetramer, it is known that the large subunit of human CAF-1 p150 dimerizes, and the dimerization is critical for the ability of CAF-1 to assemble nucleosomes (26Quivy J.P.

Dimerization of the largest subunit of chromatin assembly factor 1: importance in vitro and during Xenopus early development.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2015-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The dimerization of p150 is also regulated by protein phosphorylation (26Quivy J.P. Grandi P. Almouzni G. Dimerization of the largest subunit of chromatin assembly factor 1: importance in vitro and during Xenopus early development.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2015-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 27Gérard A.

The replication kinase Cdc7-Dbf4 promotes the interaction of the p150 subunit of chromatin assembly factor 1 with proliferating cell nuclear antigen.EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 817-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is not unprecedented that a H3-H4 chaperone forms homo-oligomers. While our studies were under review, it was shown that two members of the NAP (nucleosome assembly protein) family, Nap1 and Vps75, bind histone H3-H4 in a tetramer fashion (28Bowman A. Ward R. Wiechens N. Singh V. El-Mkami H. Norman D.G. Owen-Hughes T. The histone chaperones Nap1 and Vps75 bind histones H3 and H4 in a tetrameric conformation.Mol. Cell. 2011; 41: 398-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Both Nap1 and Vps75 form dimers. Nap1 in cells is a H2A-H2B chaperone (29Ito T. Bulger M. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Drosophila NAP-1 is a core histone chaperone that functions in ATP-facilitated assembly of regularly spaced nucleosomal arrays.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3112-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), and Vps75 is a component of Rtt109-Vps75 complex (16Han J. Zhou H. Li Z. Xu R.M. Zhang Z.

Although the significance of Nap1 and Vps75 binding H3-H4 as tetramers remains to be investigated further, these results suggest that Rtt106, Nap1, and Vps75 represent a group of histone chaperones that are different from Asf1.

https://openalex.org/W2070765663,"The transcription factor Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) plays a critical role in vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) differentiation induced by all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA). Although it has been demonstrated that ATRA stimulation augments both KLF4 protein and mRNA levels in VSMCs, the molecular mechanisms by which ATRA regulates Klf4 transcription are unknown. In this study, we examined the roles of ATRA-selective nuclear retinoic acid receptors (RARs) in the transcriptional regulation of Klf4. The introduction of small interfering RNA and an RAR antagonist demonstrated that RARα, but not RARβ or RARγ, mediated ATRA-induced Klf4 expression. A luciferase assay for the Klf4 promoter showed that three GC boxes in the proximal Klf4 promoter were indispensible for ATRA-induced Klf4 transcription and that RARα enhanced Klf4 promoter activity in a GC box-dependent manner. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation and oligonucleotide pulldown assays demonstrated that the transcription factors KLF4, Sp1, and YB1 directly bound to the GC boxes of the proximal Klf4 promoter. Upon RARα agonist stimulation, RARα was recruited to the Klf4 promoter through its interaction with KLF4, Sp1, and YB1 to form a transcriptional activation complex on the three GC boxes of the Klf4 promoter. These results suggest that RARα serves as an essential co-activator for ATRA signaling and that the recruitment of RARα to the KLF4-Sp1-YB1 complex, which leads to Klf4 expression in VSMCs, is independent of a retinoic acid response element."

Here we show that TRIM67, which has a TRIM motif, an FN3 domain and a SPRY domain, is highly expressed in the cerebellum and that TRIM67 interacts with PRG-1 and 80K-H, which is involved in the Ras-mediated signaling pathway. Ectopic expression of TRIM67 results in degradation of endogenous 80K-H and attenuation of cell proliferation and enhances neuritogenesis in the neuroblastoma cell line N1E-115. Furthermore, morphological and biological changes caused by knockdown of 80K-H are similar to those observed by overexpression of TRIM67. These findings suggest that TRIM67 regulates Ras signaling via degradation of 80K-H, leading to neural differentiation including neuritogenesis."

Streptococcus mutans dextranase belongs to glycoside hydrolase family 66, producing isomaltooligosaccharides of various sizes and consisting of at least five amino acid sequence regions. The crystal structure of the conserved fragment from Gln(100) to Ile(732) of S. mutans dextranase, devoid of its N- and C-terminal variable regions, was determined at 1.6 Å resolution and found to contain three structural domains. Domain N possessed an immunoglobulin-like β-sandwich fold; domain A contained the enzyme's catalytic module, comprising a (β/α)(8)-barrel; and domain C formed a β-sandwich structure containing two Greek key motifs. Two ligand complex structures were also determined, and, in the enzyme-isomaltotriose complex structure, the bound isomaltooligosaccharide with four glucose moieties was observed in the catalytic glycone cleft and considered to be the transglycosylation product of the enzyme, indicating the presence of four subsites, -4 to -1, in the catalytic cleft. The complexed structure with 4',5'-epoxypentyl-α-d-glucopyranoside, a suicide substrate of the enzyme, revealed that the epoxide ring reacted to form a covalent bond with the Asp(385) side chain. These structures collectively indicated that Asp(385) was the catalytic nucleophile and that Glu(453) was the acid/base of the double displacement mechanism, in which the enzyme showed a retaining catalytic character.

https://openalex.org/W2037772349,"EMILIN-3 is a glycoprotein of the extracellular matrix belonging to a family that contains a characteristic N-terminal cysteine-rich EMI domain. Currently, EMILIN-3 is the least characterized member of the elastin microfibril interface-located protein (EMILIN)/Multimerin family. Using RNA, immunohistochemical, and protein chemistry approaches, we carried out a detailed characterization of the expression and biochemical properties of EMILIN-3 in mouse. During embryonic and postnatal development, EMILIN-3 showed a peculiar and dynamic pattern of gene expression and protein distribution. EMILIN-3 mRNA was first detected at E8.5-E9.5 in the tail bud and in the primitive gut, and at later stages it became abundant in the developing gonads and osteogenic mesenchyme. Interestingly and in contrast to other EMILIN/Multimerin genes, EMILIN-3 was not found in the cardiovascular system. Despite the absence of the globular C1q domain, immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses demonstrated that EMILIN-3 forms disulfide-bonded homotrimers and higher order oligomers. Circular dichroism spectroscopy indicated that the most C-terminal part of EMILIN-3 has a substantial α-helical content and forms coiled coil structures involved in EMILIN-3 homo-oligomerization. Transfection experiments with recombinant constructs showed that the EMI domain contributes to the higher order self-assembly but was dispensable for homotrimer formation. EMILIN-3 was found to bind heparin with high affinity, a property mediated by the EMI domain, thus revealing a new function for this domain that may contribute to the interaction of EMILIN-3 with other extracellular matrix and/or cell surface molecules. Finally, in vitro experiments showed that EMILIN-3 is able to function as an extracellular regulator of the activity of TGF-β ligands."
https://openalex.org/W2047075711,"p38MAPK plays an essential role in the transition of myoblasts to differentiated myotubes through the activation of MyoD family transcription factors. A promyogenic cell surface molecule, Cdo, promotes myogenic differentiation mainly through activation of the p38MAPK pathway. Two MAP3Ks, TAK1 and ASK1, can activate p38MAPK via MKK6 in various cell systems. Moreover TAK1 has been shown to promote myogenic differentiation via p38MAPK activation. In this study, we hypothesized that TAK1 and ASK1 might function as MAP3Ks in Cdo-mediated p38MAPK activation during myoblast differentiation. Both ASK1 and TAK1 were expressed in myoblasts and interacted with the cytoplasmic tail of Cdo and a scaffold protein, JLP. The depletion of TAK1 or ASK1 in C2C12 cells decreased myoblast differentiation, whereas overexpression of TAK1 or ASK1 in C2C12 cells enhanced myotube formation. In agreement with this, overexpression of ASK1 or TAK1 resulted in enhanced p38MAPK activation, and their knockdown inhibited p38MAPK in C2C12 cells. Overexpression of TAK1 or ASK1 in Cdo(-/-) myoblasts and Cdo-depleted C2C12 cells restored p38MAPK activation as well as myotube formation. Furthermore, ASK1 and TAK1 compensated for each other in p38MAPK activation and myoblast differentiation. Taken together, these findings suggest that ASK1 and TAK1 function as MAP3Ks in Cdo-mediated p38MAPK activation to promote myogenic differentiation."

In mice, matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP7) converts inactive pro-α-defensins (proCrps) to bactericidal forms by proteolysis at specific proregion cleavage sites. MMP7(-/-) mice lack mature α-defensins in Paneth cells, accumulating unprocessed precursors for secretion. To test for activation of secreted pro-α-defensins by host and microbial proteinases in the absence of MMP7, we characterized colonic luminal α-defensins. Protein extracts of complete (organ plus luminal contents) ileum, cecum, and colon of MMP7-null and wild-type mice were analyzed by sequential gel permeation chromatography/acid-urea polyacrylamide gel analyses. Mature α-defensins were identified by N-terminal sequencing and mass spectrometry and characterized in bactericidal assays. Abundance of specific bacterial groups was measured by qPCR using group specific 16 S rDNA primers. Intact, native α-defensins, N-terminally truncated α-defensins, and α-defensin variants with novel N termini due to alternative processing were identified in MMP7(-/-) cecum and colon, and proteinases of host and microbial origin catalyzed proCrp4 activation in vitro. Although Paneth cell α-defensin deficiency is associated with ileal microbiota alterations, the cecal and colonic microbiota of MMP7(-/-) and wild-type mice were not significantly different. Thus, despite the absence of MMP7, mature α-defensins are abundant in MMP7(-/-) cecum and colon due to luminal proteolytic activation by alternative host and microbial proteinases. MMP7(-/-) mice only lack processed α-defensins in the small intestine, and the model is not appropriate for studying effects of α-defensin deficiency in cecal or colonic infection or disease."
https://openalex.org/W1976141600,"Small GTPases of the Rho family have been implicated in important cellular processes such as cell migration and adhesion, protein secretion, and/or gene transcription. In the lymphoid system, these GTPases participate in the signaling cascades that are activated after engagement of antigen receptors. However, little is known about the role that Rho GTPases play in IL-2-mediated responses. Here, we show that IL-2 induces Rac1 activation in Kit 225 T cells. We identified by mass spectrometry the muscle isoform of glycogen phosphorylase (PYGM) as a novel Rac1 effector molecule in IL-2-stimulated cells. The interaction between the active form of Rac1 (Rac1-GTP) and PYGM was established directly through a domain comprising amino acids 191-270 of PYGM that exhibits significant homology with the Rac binding domain of PAK1. The integrity of this region was crucial for PYGM activation. Importantly, IL-2-dependent cellular proliferation was inhibited upon blocking both the activation of Rac1 and the activity of PYGM. These results reveal a new role for Rac1 in cell signaling, showing that this GTPase triggers T cell proliferation upon IL-2 stimulation by associating with PYGM and modulating its enzymatic activity."

We previously identified the NG1686 protein as a gonococcal virulence factor that protects against both non-oxidative PMN-mediated killing and oxidative killing by hydrogen peroxide. In this work, we show that deletion of ng1686 affects gonococcal colony morphology but not cell morphology and that overexpression of ng1686 does not confer enhanced survival to hydrogen peroxide on gonococci.

Using sensitive 293FT reporter cell clones that had integrated a SWI/SNF-dependent NF-κB reporter gene, we find in this study that the overexpression of DPF1, DPF2, DPF3a, DPF3b, and PHF10 significantly potentiates the transactivating activity of typical NF-κB dimers. Knockdown analysis using 293FT reporter cells that endogenously express these five proteins at low levels clearly showed that DPF3a and DPF3b, which are produced from the DPF3 gene by alternative splicing, are the most critical for the RelA/p50 NF-κB heterodimer transactivation induced by TNF-α stimulation. Our data further show that this transactivation requires the SWI/SNF complex. DPF3a and DPF3b are additionally shown to interact directly with RelA, p50, and several subunits of the SWI/SNF complex in vitro and to be co-immunoprecipitated with RelA/p50 and the SWI/SNF complex from the nuclear fractions of cells treated with TNF-α. In ChIP experiments, we further found that endogenous DPF3a/b and the SWI/SNF complex are continuously present on HIV-1 LTR, whereas the kinetics of RelA/p50 recruitment after TNF-α treatment correlate well with the viral transcriptional activation levels. Additionally, re-ChIP experiments showed DPF3a/b and the SWI/SNF complex associate with RelA on the endogenous IL-6 promoter after TNF-α treatment. In conclusion, our present data indicate that by linking RelA/p50 to the SWI/SNF complex, DPF3a/b induces the transactivation of NF-κB target gene promoters in relatively inactive chromatin contexts."

Electron microscopy of purified Alba proteins from Sulfolobus acidocaldarius complexed with plasmid DNA has shown two modes of interaction: 1) two DNA duplexes interwound by Alba at subsaturating protein concentrations and 2) a single DNA duplex complexed under saturating protein concentrations with little DNA compaction.

IntroductionDNA-binding proteins that compact and regulate the availability of genetic material are essential in all organisms. In eukaryotes, the nucleosome is the fundamental chromatin unit, composed of 150 bp of DNA wrapped around two copies of each of four histones (H2a, H2b, H3, and H4) (1Luger K. Mäder A.W.

Unlike the universal chromatin proteins in eukaryotes, prokaryotes and archaea tend to utilize two or more DNA-binding proteins to package DNA (2Sandman K. Reeve J.N.

https://openalex.org/W1988994171,"Alix/AIP1 is a multifunctional adaptor protein that participates in basic cellular processes, including membrane trafficking and actin cytoskeleton assembly, by binding selectively to a variety of partner proteins. However, the mechanisms regulating Alix turnover, subcellular distribution, and function in muscle cells are unknown. We now report that Alix is expressed in skeletal muscle throughout myogenic differentiation. In myotubes, a specific pool of Alix colocalizes with Ozz, the substrate-binding component of the muscle-specific ubiquitin ligase complex Ozz-E3. We found that interaction of the two endogenous proteins in the differentiated muscle fibers changes Alix conformation and promotes its ubiquitination. This in turn regulates the levels of the protein in specific subcompartments, in particular the one containing the actin polymerization factor cortactin. In Ozz−/− myotubes, the levels of filamentous (F)-actin is perturbed, and Alix accumulates in large puncta positive for cortactin. In line with this observation, we show that the knockdown of Alix expression in C2C12 muscle cells affects the amount and distribution of F-actin, which consequently leads to changes in cell morphology, impaired formation of sarcolemmal protrusions, and defective cell motility. These findings suggest that the Ozz-E3 ligase regulates Alix at sites where the actin cytoskeleton undergoes remodeling.

In Ozz−/− myotubes, the levels of filamentous (F)-actin is perturbed, and Alix accumulates in large puncta positive for cortactin. In line with this observation, we show that the knockdown of Alix expression in C2C12 muscle cells affects the amount and distribution of F-actin, which consequently leads to changes in cell morphology, impaired formation of sarcolemmal protrusions, and defective cell motility. These findings suggest that the Ozz-E3 ligase regulates Alix at sites where the actin cytoskeleton undergoes remodeling. During the early stages of vertebrate limb development, skeletal muscle progenitor cells migrate from the lateral lip of the dermomyotome into the limb buds, where they differentiate and fuse to form the primary myotubes of limb muscles (1Ordahl C.P. Le Douarin N.M. Two myogenic lineages within the developing somite.Development. 1992; 114: 339-353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, in response to muscle lesions or disease, migration of satellite cells is required to lead the regeneration of the adult skeletal muscle. To migrate, individual cells must correctly sense or respond to migratory cues and translate a number of different inputs into appropriate cellular responses. First, a cell must discern the direction in which to move and must orient itself (i.e. polarize) so to effect directed migration. This process is largely coordinated by membrane receptors, which interpret local migratory cues and transfer them to the underlying cytoskeleton (2Orth J.D. Krueger E.W. Weller S.G. McNiven M.A. A novel endocytic mechanism of epidermal growth factor receptor sequestration and internalization.Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 3603-3610Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Lamellipodia and filopodia are then extended from the leading edge of the cell in the direction of migration. New adhesions to the extracellular matrix are initiated at the leading edge, and these serve to pull the cell forward (3Beningo K.A. Dembo M. Kaverina I. Small J.V. Wang Y.L. Nascent focal adhesions are responsible for the generation of strong propulsive forces in migrating fibroblasts.J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 881-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Central to this process is, on one hand, the actomyosin contractile machinery and the microtubules (4Dunn, G. A., (1980) in Cell Adhesion and Motility, BSCB Symposium 3 (Curtis, A. S. G., Pitts, J. D., eds) pp. 409–423, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge.Google Scholar, 5Nobes C.D. Hall A. Rho GTPases control polarity, protrusion, and adhesion during cell movement.J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1235-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar), and on the other hand the formation of membrane protrusions (6Condeelis J. Life at the leading edge. The formation of cell protrusions.Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 411-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 7Welch M.D. Mallavarapu A. Rosenblatt J. Mitchison T.J. Actin dynamics in vivo.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 54-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The latter process requires actin polymerization followed by the stabilization of the actin filaments in the area of membrane extensions (6Condeelis J. Life at the leading edge.

Actin dynamics in vivo.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 54-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms regulating cell migration remain poorly understood, this cellular process has been linked to various components of the endocytosis and the actin-polymerization machinery (8Palamidessi A.

Alix/AIP1 (ALG-2 interacting protein X or 1) is an evolutionary conserved adaptor protein that was first identified as an interactor of ALG-2 (apoptosis-linked gene 2), and in this capacity it was found to cooperate with ALG-2 in promoting apoptosis (10Vito P. Pellegrini L. Guiet C. D'Adamio L. Cloning of AIP1, a novel protein that associates with the apoptosis-linked gene ALG-2 in a Ca2+-dependent reaction.J. Biol.

More recent reports have implicated Alix in other basic cellular processes, which all hinge on membrane trafficking, endosomal sorting, and remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton (12Odorizzi G.

Stenmark H. Alix regulates cortical actin and the spatial distribution of endosomes.J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 2625-2635Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). These multitasking properties of Alix derive from the ability of the protein to interact with a plethora of partner proteins, which are themselves components of large oligomeric complexes. By interacting with the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport, ESCRT I and III, Alix synergistically coordinates endocytosis and recycling of membrane receptors, viral budding, and cytokinesis (13Matsuo H.

Protein sorting into multivesicular endosomes.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 446-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Relevant to this study are the findings that Alix also participates in cytoskeleton remodeling by binding with F-actin, α-actinin, cortactin, and focal adhesion kinase (14Cabezas A. Bache K.G.

These multiple and seemingly diverse interactions of Alix are made possible by the primary structure of the protein that includes at least three distinct protein-protein interaction domains as follows: the N-terminal Bro1 domain; a middle region called the V-domain and containing a coiled-coil motif; and a C-terminal proline-rich region (PRR), 5The abbreviations used are: PRRproline-rich regionMSCVmurine stem cell virus. which is a potential docking site for proteins containing Src homology 3 domains (22Fisher R.D.

Both the Bro1 and the PRR domains of Alix bind F-actin, whereas the N-terminal half of its V-domain interacts with α-actinin and cortactin. Given that Alix directly interacts with α-actinin and promotes its association with F-actin in fibroblast, a direct role of Alix in the F-actin bundling step of stress fiber assembly has been proposed (21Pan S.

It is noteworthy that among the proteins known to interact directly or indirectly with Alix are components of the ubiquitin pathway, including the deubiquitinating enzyme Doa4 and the E3 ubiquitin ligases Cbl, POSH (plenty of Src homology 3), and Nedd4-1 (25Votteler J.

The latter two ligases have been shown to ubiquitinate and cooperate with Alix during the process of HIV-1 release. However, the functional significance of Alix ubiquitination by these ligases is still poorly understood. Despite the wealth of information on the proteins that interact with Alix and the physiological processes to which they contribute, the mechanisms regulating the turnover and subcellular distribution of Alix are still largely unknown. We now report that in muscle cells Alix is a substrate of the RING-type ubiquitin ligase, Ozz-E3. Ozz (also known as Neurl2 or Neutralized-like protein 2) is a member of the SOCS (suppressor of cytokine signaling) family of proteins and is the substrate-recognition module of Ozz-E3 (29Nastasi T. Bongiovanni A. Campos Y. Mann L. Toy J.N. Bostrom J. Rottier R. Hahn C. Conaway J.W. Harris A.J. D'Azzo A.

This ligase complex includes, beside Ozz, Elongin B/C (Elo B/C), Rbx1, and Cullin 5 (Cul5) (29Nastasi T. Bongiovanni A. Campos Y. Mann L. Toy J.N. Bostrom J. Rottier R. Hahn C. Conaway J.W.

Cell. 2004; 6: 269-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that Ozz-E3 plays an active role in myofiber differentiation and maturation, during embryogenesis and muscle regeneration, by targeting and ubiquitinating two proteins within macromolecular complexes as follows: the sarcolemma-associated pool of β-catenin, and the sarcomeric embryonic myosin heavy chain (MyHCemb) (29Nastasi T.

Ozz−/− mice develop overt sarcomeric defects, which we attribute in part to impaired turnover of cadherin-associated β-catenin and to incomplete exchange of embryonic MyHC isoforms with their neonatal and adult counterparts within the sarcomere, during myofiber differentiation (29Nastasi T.

These findings point to distinct functions of Ozz to maintain the integrity of at least two cell compartments, containing actin filaments, the sarcolemmal-associated cortical cytoskeleton and the sarcomere. Here, we demonstrate that Alix modulates actin and membrane dynamics in muscle cells and propose that Ozz intervention in this process in required at specific subcellular sites of the differentiated myotubes. The animal work was first approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital that governs animal research at this Institution (approval ID 388). The research was then conducted in compliance with appropriate guidelines from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International, the United States Public Health Service, and United States Department of Agriculture animal welfare regulations. All surgery was performed under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering. Rabbit anti-Ozz antibody was prepared as described (29Nastasi T. Bongiovanni A.

Polyclonal antibodies against Alix were generated by Rockland Immunochemicals Inc. (Gilbertsville, PA). Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated polyclonal anti-Alix was labeled and purified according to the manufacturer's procedure. Commercial antibodies included the following: mouse anti-AIP1/Alix for immunoblotting (BD Transduction Laboratories); anti-Alix (clones 1A12, 3A9, and 2H12, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for immunofluorescence; anti-GAPDH (Millipore); anti-pan-actin (Cell Signaling); anti-α-enolase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-β-catenin (BD Transduction Laboratories); anti-polyubiquitin (Thermo Scientific); anti-cortactin (Millipore); anti-FLAG (Sigma); normal rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit (Jackson ImmunoResearch); Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse 1:500 (Invitrogen); and FITC-phalloidin (Sigma). Synthetic siGENOME, ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool siRNAs targeting Alix, standard negative controls (siCONTROL NonTargeting siRNAs and ON-TARGETplus siCONTROL NonTargeting Pool), and the transfection reagent DharmaFECT3 were purchased from Dharmacon. Ozz was transiently expressed in C2C12 using the MSCV-based bicistronic retroviral vector encoding full-length Ozz and the green fluorescent protein (MSCV-Ozz-IRES-GFP) (31Persons D.A. Allay J.A.

McKinnon, Dept. of Genetics, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital) for putative Ozz-binding partners was performed as described previously (29Nastasi T. Bongiovanni A. Campos Y. Mann L. Toy J.N.

Three cDNA clones encoding Alix were isolated, the smallest of which encoded a fragment from 424 to 868 amino acids. To map the minimal region mediating the interaction with Ozz, three deletion mutants of this shorter Alix fragment were generated by PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and appropriate primers (see below). These PCR fragments were digested with SalI and NotI and subcloned into the prey vector pEXP-AD502 in-frame with the GAL4 activation domain. The full-length (bp 1–845) Ozz was subcloned in-frame with the GAL4 DNA binding domain of the bait vector pDBLeu. All resulting constructs were confirmed by sequence analysis. The bait and prey constructs were co-transformed into yeast strain Mav203. Two reporter genes (lacZ and HIS3) were employed to examine the interaction (Invitrogen). For the construction of the deletion mutants of Alix to be tested in the yeast two-hybrid assay, the following primers were used: M-533–868, forward AAAAAGTCGACCGCCATCCCCTCTGCTAACCC and reverse TAATTGCGGCCGCCTACTGCTGTGGATAGTAAGACTGCTGC; M-667–868, forward AAATTGTCGACCGTAGCTAACTTGAAGGAGGGC and reverse TAATTGCGGCCGCCTACTGCTGTGGATAGTAAGACTGCTGC; M-771–868, forward AAATTGTCGACCGCTTCTGCTGCTGCTGCCCCTGC and reverse TAATTGCGGCCGCCTACTGCTGTGGATAGTAAGACTGCTGC. The mouse myoblast cell line C2C12 was maintained in high glucose DMEM supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum (FCS), sodium pyruvate, l-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin (proliferation medium) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Myotube differentiation was induced when the medium was supplemented with 2% horse serum in place of FCS (differentiation medium). Plasmid and siRNAs were transfected using DharmaFECT3 (Dharmacon) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, C2C12 cells were plated 1 day before transfection in 10-cm dishes (∼2 × 105 cells/dish). On the day of the transfection, the cells were ∼50% confluent. 250 μl of siRNA duplex (2 μm) was diluted in 250 μl of DMEM (without FCS, sodium pyruvate, l-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin) and mixed with 20 μl of DharmaFECT3 (Dharmacon). The mixture was added to cells grown in DMEM (without FCS, penicillin, and streptomycin). After 2–3 h, FCS was added to a final concentration of 20%. The cells were incubated for 48 h in the presence of the siRNA oligonucleotides. Then cells from each dish were re-plated into two new dishes and incubated for another 24 h in proliferation medium (for D0) or 72 h in differentiation medium (for D3), in the absence of siRNA. For the three-dimensional cultures, C2C12 cells were seeded inside a 50-mm thick collagen I gel (diluted 1:10; BD Biosciences), in inserts for 24-well plates (50,000 cells/insert; BD Biosciences). The three-dimensional culture was then submerged in proliferating or differentiating medium and incubated for 24 or 72 h. Cells were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in sodium cacodylate buffer and processed for electron microscopy (32Di Felice V. Ardizzone N.M. De Luca A. Marcianò V. Gammazza A.M. Macaluso F. Manente L.

For FACS assay, mock-treated and Alix-silenced C2C12 cells were trypsinized, and 106 cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS before permeabilization with 0.03% Triton X-100 and stained with 33 nm FITC-phalloidin. Mean cellular F-actin content, as determined by phalloidin staining, was quantified using the FACScan (BD Biosciences). For wound healing assay, siRNA- and mock-treated C2C12 cells were replated, and after 24 h of incubation, cells were scratched with a micropipette tip. The culture medium was replaced with completed DMEM, and after culture for 24 h, cell migration was observed with a Leica inverted microscope. To analyze the process of adhesion, the rate of attachment to plastic of siRNA- versus mock-treated C2C12 cells was tested using the in vitro cell attachment assays. Trypsinized cells were washed once and resuspended in prewarmed DMEM containing 20% FBS at a density of 104 cells/cm2. Single cell suspensions were added to 6-well dishes. At different times (6, 10, 20, 40, and 60 min), the wells were gently washed three times under constant agitation with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove nonadherent cells; the adherent cells were then trypsinized and counted. Results were expressed as percent of attachment as compared with initial seeded cells that represented 100% of attachment. Cells were cultured on 24-well plate inserts (BD Biosciences) and were treated as described previously (33Di Felice V. Cappello F. Montalbano A. Ardizzone N.M. De Luca A. Macaluso F. Amelio D.

Cytoplasmic, membrane/organelle, nuclear, and cytoskeletal fractions were prepared using a ProteoExtract® subcellular proteome extraction kit (Calbiochem, Merck) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentrations were determined at A595, using BSA as standard. 20–30 μg of cytoplasmic protein or cell equivalent amounts of the other fractions were electrophoresed (100 V, 60 min) on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and wet-blotted overnight at 90 mA. Membranes were probed with specific antibodies, followed by HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences). The specific secondary antibody binding was detected with a SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientific). Each of the immunoblots included in the figures was representative of results obtained in at least three independent experiments. To test the in vivo ubiquitination of Alix, 0.5–1 mg of cytosolic or membrane proteins were adjusted to 2 mm CaCl2 (final concentrations) in a final volume of 1 ml, pre-cleared by 1 h of incubation at room temperature with 25 μl of protein A/G Plus-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and then spun at 1000 × g. 2 μg of the indicated antibodies or equal amounts of control IgG were added to the supernatant, incubated overnight at 4 °C, and followed by immunoprecipitation for 2 h of incubation at room temperature with protein A/G Plus-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The beads were washed five times with Hypotonic buffer supplemented with 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and the bound proteins detached and run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels under denaturing conditions. Membranes were blocked and probed with specific antibodies and then washed before incubation with species-appropriate secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Where indicated, blots were analyzed using an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR), and relevant signal intensity was determined using LI-COR imaging software. Each of the immunoblots included in the figures was representative of results obtained in at least three independent experiments. The Ozz-Alix complex was detected in post-nuclear fractions of muscle cells by immunoprecipitation with either the anti-Ozz or the anti-Alix antibodies. Cultured C2C12 or primary myoblasts (D0) and myotubes (D3) were lysed with Hypotonic buffer, incubated at 4 °C for 30 min, and then disrupted by Dounce homogenization (40 strokes). Cellular debris and nuclei were removed by 10 min of centrifugation at 800 × g, and 0.5–1 mg of post-nuclear proteins were adjusted to 2 mm CaCl2 (final concentrations) in a final volume of 1–1.3 ml and pre-cleared by 1 h of incubation at room temperature with 25 μl of protein A/G Plus-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and then spun at 1000 × g. Anti-Alix (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or polyclonal anti-Ozz antibodies or the appropriate antibodies used as negative controls were added to the supernatant and incubated overnight at 4 °C, followed by immunoprecipitation with protein A/G Plus-agarose beads for 2 h of incubation at room temperature.

These T cells carry out immune functions, using the C-C chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) and its cognate ligands, CCL19 and CCL21, to enter and travel through the lymph nodes. Distinct roles for each ligand in regulating T lymphocyte trafficking have remained elusive. We report that in the human T cell line HuT78 and in primary murine T lymphocytes, signaling from CCR7/CCL19 leads to increased expression and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5 (ERK5) within eight hours of stimulation. Within 48-72 h we observed peak levels of endothelial differentiation gene 1 (EDG-1), which mediates the egress of T lymphocytes from lymph nodes. The increased expression of EDG-1 was preceded by up-regulation of its transcription factor, Krüppel-like factor 2 (KLF-2). To determine the cellular effect of disrupting ERK5 signaling from CCR7, we examined the migration of ERK5(flox/flox)/Lck-Cre murine T cells to EDG-1 ligands. While CCL19-stimulated ERK5(flox/flox) naïve T cells showed increased migration to EDG-1 ligands at 48 h, the migration of ERK5(flox/flox)/Lck-Cre T cells remained at a basal level. Accordingly, we define a novel signaling pathway that controls EDG-1 up-regulation following stimulation of T cells by CCR7/CCL19. This is the first report to link the two signaling events that control migration through the lymph nodes: CCR7 mediates entry into the lymph nodes and EDG-1 signaling controls their subsequent exit."
https://openalex.org/W1965380456,"Cross-linking of ligand-engaged cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) to the T cell receptor (TCR) during the early phase of T cell activation attenuates TCR signaling, leading to T cell inhibition. To promote this event, a bispecific fusion protein comprising a mutant mouse CD80 (CD80w88a) and lymphocyte activation antigen-3 was engineered to concurrently engage CTLA-4 and cross-link it to the TCR. Cross-linking is expected to be attained via ligation of CTLA-4 first to MHCII and then indirectly to the TCR, generating a CTLA-4-MHCII-TCR trimolecular complex that forms between T cells and antigen-presenting cells during T cell activation. Treating T cells with this bispecific fusion protein inhibited T cell activation. In addition, it induced the production of IL-10 and TGF-β and attenuated AKT and mTOR signaling. Intriguingly, treatment with the bispecific fusion protein also directed early T cell differentiation into Foxp3-positive regulatory T cells (Tregs). This process was dependent on the endogenous production of TGF-β. Thus, bispecific fusion proteins that engage CTLA-4 and co-ligate it to the TCR during the early phase of T cell activation can negatively regulate the T cell response. Bispecific biologics with such dual functions may therefore represent a novel class of therapeutics for immune modulation. These findings presented here also reveal a potential new role for CTLA-4 in Treg differentiation."

Sequence alignment shows that PR is the founder of the new AKR13D subfamily and is designated AKR13D1. The x-ray structure of methylated His(6)-PR was solved to 2.31 Å. However, the active site of PR was blocked by the connected parts of the neighbor symmetric molecule in the crystal. To break the interactions and obtain the enzyme-ligand complexes, the A213W mutant was generated. The atomic structure of His(6)-PR-A213W complex with NADPH was determined at 1.77 Å. Overall, PR folds in an unusual α(8)/β(6) barrel that has not been observed in any other AKR protein to date. NADPH binds in an extended pocket, but the nicotinamide riboside moiety is disordered. Upon NADPH binding, dramatic conformational changes and movements were observed: two additional β-strands in the C terminus become ordered to form one α-helix, and a movement of up to 24 Å occurs. This conformational change creates a large space that allows the binding of substrates of variable size for PR and enhances the enzyme activity; as a result cooperative kinetics are observed as NADPH is varied. As the founding member of the new AKR13D subfamily, PR also provides a structural template and model of cofactor binding for the AKR13 family."

The scaffold protein of protein associated with Lin-7 1 (Pals1) forms a complex with two other scaffold proteins, Pals-associated tight junction protein (Patj) and mammalian homolog-2 of Lin-7 (Mals2), through its tandem Lin-2 and Lin-7 (L27) domains to regulate apical-basal polarity. Here, we report the crystal structure of a 4-L27 domain-containing heterotrimer derived from the tripartite complex Patj/Pals1/Mals2. The heterotrimer consists of two cognate pairs of heterodimeric L27 domains with similar conformations. Structural analysis and biochemical data further show that the dimers assemble mutually independently. Additionally, such mutually independent assembly of the two heterodimers can be observed in another tripartite complex, Disks large homolog 1 (DLG1)/calcium-calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase (CASK)/Mals2.

In one case, Mycoplasma mobile leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS) is uniquely missing its entire amino acid editing domain, called CP1, which is otherwise present in all known LeuRSs and also isoleucyl- and valyl-tRNA synthetases. This hydrolytic CP1 domain was fused to a synthetic core composed of a Rossmann ATP-binding fold. The fusion event splits the primary structure of the Rossmann fold into two halves. Hybrid LeuRS chimeras using M. mobile LeuRS as a scaffold were constructed to investigate the evolutionary protein:protein fusion of the CP1 editing domain to the Rossmann fold domain that is ubiquitously found in kinases and dehydrogenases, in addition to class I aaRSs. Significantly, these results determined that the modular construction of aaRSs and their adaptation to accommodate more stringent amino acid specificities included CP1-dependent distal effects on amino acid discrimination in the synthetic core. As increasingly sophisticated protein synthesis machinery evolved, the addition of the CP1 domain increased specificity in the synthetic site, as well as provided a hydrolytic editing site."

https://openalex.org/W2039668853,"Secondary active transporters from the SLC17 protein family are required for excitatory and purinergic synaptic transmission, sialic acid metabolism, and renal function, and several members are associated with inherited neurological or metabolic diseases. However, molecular tools to investigate their function or correct their genetic defects are limited or absent. Using structure-activity, homology modeling, molecular docking, and mutagenesis studies, we have located the substrate-binding site of sialin (SLC17A5), a lysosomal sialic acid exporter also recently implicated in exocytotic release of aspartate. Human sialin is defective in two inherited sialic acid storage diseases and is responsible for metabolic incorporation of the dietary nonhuman sialic acid N-glycolylneuraminic acid. We built cytosol-open and lumen-open three-dimensional models of sialin based on weak, but significant, sequence similarity with the glycerol-3-phosphate and fucose permeases from Escherichia coli, respectively. Molecular docking of 31 synthetic sialic acid analogues to both models was consistent with inhibition studies. Narrowing the sialic acid-binding site in the cytosol-open state by two phenylalanine to tyrosine mutations abrogated recognition of the most active analogue without impairing neuraminic acid transport. Moreover, a pilot virtual high-throughput screening of the cytosol-open model could identify a pseudopeptide competitive inhibitor showing >100-fold higher affinity than the natural substrate. This validated model of human sialin and sialin-guided models of other SLC17 transporters should pave the way for the identification of inhibitors, glycoengineering tools, pharmacological chaperones, and fluorescent false neurotransmitters targeted to these proteins."

Therefore, a connection might exist between listericidal components and L. monocytogenes immunity within the phagosomes. Here, we examine the hypothesis that a common listericidal route induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines may be compartmentalized in unique vesicles connecting STAT-mediated signaling, trafficking regulators, listericidal lysosomal enzymes such as CTSD, and immune phagosomal functions. We also examined the possibility that the compartmentalization of functions within phagosomes might be useful to confer protection against listeriosis. Our approach involved the use of differential gene expression methods combined with basic proteomic, functional analyses of L. monocytogenes phagosomes, and their use as vaccine vectors against listeriosis. All these studies were verified using MØs genetically deficient in putative upstream components of this signaling route such as STAT-1 and STAT-3 and the postulated downstream lysosomal component CTSD.

MØ-like cell lines or BM-DM were cultured into 96-well plates at 1 × 106 cells/ml in the presence or absence of the above-mentioned cytokines 72 h before infection. Cells were infected with L. monocytogenes at a ratio of 10:1 (bacteria/cell) as reported previously for different times (0, 4, 8, or 16 h). CFU ratios were performed as reported and represented the ratio of CFU at 8 h to CFU at 0 h ± S.D. of triplicates (4Prada-Delgado A. Carrasco-Marin E. Bokoch G.M. Alvarez-Dominguez C.

J-774 cells (2 × 106 cells/ml) were cultured in microtiter plates. Cells were pretreated or not with cytokines for 72 h and next infected for 1 h with 2 × 107 CFU/ml of L. monocytogenes. H2O2 and NO2 production was measured as described previously (10Alvarez-Domínguez C. Carrasco-Marín E. López-Mato P. Leyva-Cobián F. The contribution of both oxygen and nitrogen intermediates to the intracellular killing mechanisms of C1q-opsonized Listeria monocytogenes by the macrophage-like IC-21 cell line.Immunology. 2000; 101: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In brief, the H2O2 production was measured by the HRP-dependent conversion of phenol red by H2O2 into a compound with increased absorbance at 600 nm using a H2O2 standard curve. Results are expressed as nanomoles of H2O2 produced per cell. The nitrite production was determined with the Griess reagent using a sodium nitrite standard curve. Results were expressed as nanomoles of NO per cell. Samples were performed in triplicate, and results are the mean ± of three independent experiments. J-774 cells or BM-DM cells were cultured at 1 × 108 cells in the presence or absence of cytokines 72 h before infection. Cells were infected with L. monocytogenes at a ratio of 10:1 (bacteria/cell) for 20 min. Phagosome isolation was performed as described previously (4Prada-Delgado A. Carrasco-Marin E. Bokoch G.M. Alvarez-Dominguez C. Interferon-γ listericidal action is mediated by novel Rab5a functions at the phagosomal environment.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19059-19065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and as detailed in supplemental material. J-774 cells (1 × 106 cell/well) were cultured in 6-well plates in the presence or absence of 10 ng/ml IFN-γ or 20 ng/ml IL-6 for 16 h. Cytokine-treated cells were infected with L. monocytogenes, 10403S wild type strain (10:1 bacteria: cell ratio), for 15 min at 37 °C, followed by a 45-min incubation in the presence of 20 μg/ml gentamicin followed by 4 h in D5 medium. Noninfected samples (NI) were cultured at same cell density and treated with the above cytokines. Basal level control corresponded with nontreated and noninfected samples (NT and NI samples). Later on, the total RNA was extracted from cells using the Qiagen kit (RNeasy total RNA isolation kit, Qiagen, product number 74104). The amount of total RNA extracted per sample varied between 25 and 30 μg. RNA integrity was analyzed in 1% agarose gels (28 S and 18 S ribosomal RNA forms were observed as nondegraded in a 2:1 proportion). RNA quality was estimated by a close to 2.0 value of the ratio A260/280 nm, and concentration was calculated with the assumption that 1 OD corresponds with 40 μg of RNA measured at A260 nm. Differential microarrays were performed with the Affymetrix GeneChip MOE430A2.0 that evaluated 22626 mouse genes with GCOS 1.3 Affymetrix® software (Progenika S. A., Spain). The fold changes of gene expression values are expressed as the signal log ratio that corresponds to the log2 of fold change (FC) in a previous version of Affymetrix software. Therefore, signal log ratio values of ≥0.3 were induced genes as they corresponded to values ≥1.2 FC, and ≤ −0.3 were depressed genes as they corresponded with values ≤ −1.2 FC. All our final values were subtracted from the values of basal controls (NT and NI values). Other controls include L. monocytogenes infected versus NT and NI values and are shown in supplemental Table S1. Gene ontology information was derived from Progenika S.A. (Affymetrix NetAffx Analysis Center). GST-PBDPAK (kindly provided by G. Bockoch, UCLA), the p21-activated kinase-derived binding domain for activated RAC2 protein, and the His-EEA1218 (a gift from D. Lambright. Texas University), the FYVE domain of the EEA1 protein containing the binding domain for RAB5A-GTP, were expressed in Escherichia coli BL-21 strain. Recombinant proteins were induced with 5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside for 5 h at 37 °C and purified with glutathione-Sepharose or TALON resins, respectively, according to instructions provided by the manufacturer (Clontech). LLO(1–99) and LLO(189–201) were synthesized by F. Roncal (Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificase, Madrid, Spain) with a purity higher than 95% after HPLC and mass spectrometry. 30 μg of isolated phagosomes were loaded per lane onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Gels were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 °C as follows: mouse anti-Stat1, mouse anti-inducible NOS (Pharmingen), rabbit anti-STAT1-YPhos, rabbit anti-STAT3-SPhos, rabbit anti-STAT3-YPhos (Vitro), rabbit polyclonal anti-LLO specific antibody (Diatheva), mouse anti-PLY5 monoclonal antibody that recognize LLO undecapeptide sequence (15Carrasco-Marín E.

Utermöhlen, Kölhn University, Kölhn, Germany), and rabbit anti-cathepsin-D and rabbit anti-Rac2 (kindly provided by G. Bockoch, UCLA). Thereafter, secondary antibodies were HRP-conjugated (The Jackson Laboratory) and developed by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). To detect RAC2-GTP forms, we used a previously reported overlay assay (4Prada-Delgado A. Carrasco-Marin E. Bokoch G.M. Alvarez-Dominguez C. Interferon-γ listericidal action is mediated by novel Rab5a functions at the phagosomal environment.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19059-19065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In brief, phagosomes were lysed and immunoprecipitated with GST-PBDPAK. Immunoprecipitates were run onto SDS-PAGE and transferred to NC membranes. Primary antibody (rabbit anti-Rac2) was incubated overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. For His-EEA1(218) overlay assay to detect RAB5A-GTP, we immunoprecipitated Rab5a using 4F11 antibody, run onto an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to NC membranes. Membranes were treated sequentially with re-naturalization buffer and binding buffer, followed by o/n incubation at 4 °C with 100 ng/ml of His-EEA1218 diluted into binding buffer. Blots were developed with secondary rabbit anti-His6 antibody followed by ECL. To detect LLO bound to MHC class II molecules, phagosomal lysates were immunoprecipitated with mouse anti-IAk antibody (10.3.62) or anti-IAb antibody (Y3P). Immunoprecipitates were run onto SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to NC membranes. Primary antibody (rabbit anti-LLO) was incubated overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. As internal control in all Western blots, we included the marker, RAB5C, and the expression level was not modified by the cytokine treatment (4Prada-Delgado A. Carrasco-Marin E. Bokoch G.M. Alvarez-Dominguez C. Interferon-γ listericidal action is mediated by novel Rab5a functions at the phagosomal environment.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19059-19065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Western blots were developed by ECL. Ctsd+/+ mice were treated (Ctsdlow) or not (Ctsd+/+) (n = 5) for 3 days with 0.5 mg/ml pepstatin-A previous to vaccination and during the vaccination protocol as described previously (15Carrasco-Marín E. Madrazo-Toca F. de los Toyos J.R. Cacho-Alonso E. Tobes R. Pareja E. Paradela A. Albar J.P. Chen W. Gomez-Lopez M.T. Alvarez-Dominguez C.

L. monocytogenes phagosomes containing 500 CFU/∼30 μg of phagosomal proteins were obtained from BM-DM of Ctsd+/+ or CBA/J mice, previously treated for 72 h with 10 ng/ml mouse recombinant IFN-γ (P-IFN), IL-6 (P-IL-6), or left untreated (P-NT). These phagosomes were inoculated in the peritoneal cavity (i.p.) of CTSD+/+ or CTSDlow (n = 5) mice for 7 or 14 days or were nonvaccinated (NV). Next, all mice were inoculated with 103 CFU of L. monocytogenes intraperitoneally for 3 additional days. The vaccination timing follows similar protocols previously reported for studies using L. monocytogenes as vaccine (16Lauer P. Hanson B. Lemmens E.E. Liu W. Luckett W.S. Leong M.L. Allen H.E. Skoble J. Bahjat K.S. Freitag N.E. Brockstedt D.G. Dubensky Jr., T.W. Constitutive activation of the PrfA regulon enhances the potency of vaccines based on live-attenuated and killed but metabolically active Listeria monocytogenes strains.Infect. Immun. 2008; 76: 3742-3753Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Mice were bled before sacrifice and serum-stored at −80 °C to measure cytokines by FACS analysis. Spleens and livers were homogenized, and CFUs were counted in homogenates. Similar protocols were performed in CBA/J, SCID, or 129/Sv mice using P-NT, P-IFN, or P-IL-6 phagosomes obtained from BM-DM from the bone marrow cells of these mouse strains and vaccinations each 7 days (SCID and 129/Sv mice) or 14 days (CBA/J mice). Peritoneal exudate cells (PEC) were obtained after Hanks' wash of the peritoneal cavity and cell surface-labeled with antibodies against the following markers: CD11b (marker for MØs), CD11c (marker for DC), Ly6C (marker for DCi), Ly6G (also known as Gr-1, marker for PMNs), Dx5 (marker for NK cells), CD3 and CD8 (markers for cytotoxic T cells) (Tc), IAk (MHC-II for CBA/J mice), IAd (MHC-II for SCID and 129/Sv mice), or IAb (MHC-II for CTSD+/+, CTSD−/−, or CTSDlow mice) and analyzed by FACS. We also used FACS analysis for cell surface labeling of BM-DM (100.000 cells) treated or not for 72 h with 10 ng/ml IFN-γ as activating stimulus using monoclonal antibodies FITC or phycoerythrin-labeled (BD Biosciences) against the above-mentioned cell surface markers. The analysis of BM-DM oxidative burst using L. monocytogenes as stimulus (10 min, 37 °C) and using the Phagoburst® kit (Orphegen Pharma, Heidelberg, Germany) was also performed by FACS analysis. TNF-α and IL-6 production by BM-DM infected with wild type L. monocytogenes was also measured in culture supernatants by FACS analysis as well as in sera from different mice (CBA kit from BD Biosciences). BM-DM were incubated in microtiter plates at a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml with medium alone or with 2 × 107 CFU/ml of L. monocytogenes for 1 h without antibiotics, followed by 24 h of incubation in D5 complete medium. Cells were centrifuged, and half of the supernatants volume was harvested and stored at −80 °C until FACS analysis. Samples were performed in triplicate, and the results are the means ± S.D. of two separate experiments. We used FACS analysis for cell surface labeling of spleen cells (100,000 cells), using monoclonal antibodies FITC- or antigen-presenting cells labeled (BD Biosciences) against CD4 or CD8. Peptides used were LLO(1–99) or LLO(189–201). For in vitro culture, spleen cells were plated into 96-well round-bottom plates (5 × 106 cells/ml) and stimulated with each of the LLO(91–99) or LLO(189–201) peptides independently (10−5 m each peptide) for 5 h in the presence of brefeldin A (intracellular cytokine staining) as described previously (16Lauer P. Hanson B. Lemmens E.E. Liu W. Luckett W.S. Leong M.L. Allen H.E. Skoble J. Bahjat K.S. Freitag N.E. Brockstedt D.G. Dubensky Jr., T.W.

Immun. 2008; 76: 3742-3753Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Stimulated cells were surface-stained for CD4 and CD8 and then fixed and permeabilized using a cytofix/cytoperm kit (BD Biosciences). Cells were stained for IFN-γ with antibody anti-IFN-γ phycoerythrin-labeled. Samples were acquired using a FACSCanto flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Data were gated to include exclusively CD4+ or CD8+ events, and the percentages of these cells expressing IFN-γ were determined according to the manufacturer's recommendations (BD Biosciences). Results of LLO peptide-stimulated splenocytes were corrected according to the percentages of total CD4+ and CD8+ cells, respectively. Data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Treestar, Ashland, OR). For statistical analysis, the Student's t test was applied. This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the Spanish Ministry of Science, Research and Innovation. The Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of the University of Cantabria approved this protocol (Permit Number 2009/12) that follows the Spanish legislation (RD 1201/2005). All surgery was performed under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering. J-774 MØ-like cells display basal levels of MØ-associated microbicidal abilities and can be transformed into highly bactericidal cells upon cytokine treatment (4Prada-Delgado A. Carrasco-Marin E.

IL-6 and IL-12 specifically regulate the expression of Rab5 and Rab7 via distinct signaling pathways.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2878-2888Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Therefore, we evaluated the activation of these cells when exposed to pro-inflammatory cytokines that are involved in L. monocytogenes immune responses (i.e. TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-12). IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-6 induced killing of intracellular L. monocytogenes in J-774 cells as observed by the reduced replication ability of L. monocytogenes, although IL-10 and IL-12 had no effect (Fig. 1A). We also confirmed that these cytokines promoted L. monocytogenes killing comparing the infection kinetics of J-774 cells and real MØ such as BM-DM. These cytokines clearly enhanced the microbicidal abilities of BM-DM and also increased the listericidal abilities of J-774 cells (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B). Therefore, J-774 cells and BM-DM were comparative models to study the listericidal mechanisms induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines. Oxidative bactericidal mechanisms were examined by measuring hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and nitric oxide (NO) production, both of which decrease intracellular L. monocytogenes viability. Only IFN-γ and IL-6 induced the production of both oxidative compounds in J-774 cells (Fig. 1B). We next determined the relevance of these cytokines at the phagosomal level by examining intraphagosomal L. monocytogenes viability as a measurement of L. monocytogenes degradation as reported previously (4Prada-Delgado A. Carrasco-Marin E. Bokoch G.M. Alvarez-Dominguez C. Interferon-γ listericidal action is mediated by novel Rab5a functions at the phagosomal environment.J. Biol.

Only IFN-γ and IL-6 treatment of J-774 cells decreased bacterial viability, indicating their importance for L. monocytogenes degradation within the phagosomes (Fig. 1C, white bars). Lysosomal hydrolases are responsible for the nonoxidative listericidal mechanisms that degrade L. monocytogenes within the phagosomal compartment (13del Cerro-Vadillo E. Madrazo-Toca F.
