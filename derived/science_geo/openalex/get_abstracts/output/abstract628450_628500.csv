https://openalex.org/W2914482125,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly heritable and heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental phenotypes diagnosed in more than 1% of children. Common genetic variants contribute substantially to ASD susceptibility, but to date no individual variants have been robustly associated with ASD. With a marked sample-size increase from a unique Danish population resource, we report a genome-wide association meta-analysis of 18,381 individuals with ASD and 27,969 controls that identified five genome-wide-significant loci. Leveraging GWAS results from three phenotypes with significantly overlapping genetic architectures (schizophrenia, major depression, and educational attainment), we identified seven additional loci shared with other traits at equally strict significance levels. Dissecting the polygenic architecture, we found both quantitative and qualitative polygenic heterogeneity across ASD subtypes. These results highlight biological insights, particularly relating to neuronal function and corticogenesis, and establish that GWAS performed at scale will be much more productive in the near term in ASD."
https://openalex.org/W2916906462,"Recent advances in the isolation and stacking of monolayers of van der Waals materials have provided approaches for the preparation of quantum materials in the ultimate two-dimensional limit1,2. In van der Waals heterostructures formed by stacking two monolayer semiconductors, lattice mismatch or rotational misalignment introduces an in-plane moiré superlattice3. It is widely recognized that the moiré superlattice can modulate the electronic band structure of the material and lead to transport properties such as unconventional superconductivity4 and insulating behaviour driven by correlations5-7; however, the influence of the moiré superlattice on optical properties has not been investigated experimentally. Here we report the observation of multiple interlayer exciton resonances with either positive or negative circularly polarized emission in a molybdenum diselenide/tungsten diselenide (MoSe2/WSe2) heterobilayer with a small twist angle. We attribute these resonances to excitonic ground and excited states confined within the moiré potential. This interpretation is supported by recombination dynamics and by the dependence of these interlayer exciton resonances on twist angle and temperature. These results suggest the feasibility of engineering artificial excitonic crystals using van der Waals heterostructures for nanophotonics and quantum information applications."
https://openalex.org/W2915165152,"The formation of moiré patterns in crystalline solids can be used to manipulate their electronic properties, which are fundamentally influenced by periodic potential landscapes. In two-dimensional materials, a moiré pattern with a superlattice potential can be formed by vertically stacking two layered materials with a twist and/or a difference in lattice constant. This approach has led to electronic phenomena including the fractal quantum Hall effect1-3, tunable Mott insulators4,5 and unconventional superconductivity6. In addition, theory predicts that notable effects on optical excitations could result from a moiré potential in two-dimensional valley semiconductors7-9, but these signatures have not been detected experimentally. Here we report experimental evidence of interlayer valley excitons trapped in a moiré potential in molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2)/tungsten diselenide (WSe2) heterobilayers. At low temperatures, we observe photoluminescence close to the free interlayer exciton energy but with linewidths over one hundred times narrower (around 100 microelectronvolts). The emitter g-factors are homogeneous across the same sample and take only two values, -15.9 and 6.7, in samples with approximate twist angles of 60 degrees and 0 degrees, respectively. The g-factors match those of the free interlayer exciton, which is determined by one of two possible valley-pairing configurations. At twist angles of approximately 20 degrees the emitters become two orders of magnitude dimmer; however, they possess the same g-factor as the heterobilayer at a twist angle of approximately 60 degrees. This is consistent with the umklapp recombination of interlayer excitons near the commensurate 21.8-degree twist angle7. The emitters exhibit strong circular polarization of the same helicity for a given twist angle, which suggests that the trapping potential retains three-fold rotational symmetry. Together with a characteristic dependence on power and excitation energy, these results suggest that the origin of the observed effects is interlayer excitons trapped in a smooth moiré potential with inherited valley-contrasting physics. This work presents opportunities to control two-dimensional moiré optics through variation of the twist angle."
https://openalex.org/W2906387878,"Moiré superlattices enable the generation of new quantum phenomena in two-dimensional heterostructures, in which the interactions between the atomically thin layers qualitatively change the electronic band structure of the superlattice. For example, mini-Dirac points, tunable Mott insulator states and the Hofstadter butterfly pattern can emerge in different types of graphene/boron nitride moiré superlattices, whereas correlated insulating states and superconductivity have been reported in twisted bilayer graphene moiré superlattices1-12. In addition to their pronounced effects on single-particle states, moiré superlattices have recently been predicted to host excited states such as moiré exciton bands13-15. Here we report the observation of moiré superlattice exciton states in tungsten diselenide/tungsten disulfide (WSe2/WS2) heterostructures in which the layers are closely aligned. These moiré exciton states manifest as multiple emergent peaks around the original WSe2 A exciton resonance in the absorption spectra, and they exhibit gate dependences that are distinct from that of the A exciton in WSe2 monolayers and in WSe2/WS2 heterostructures with large twist angles. These phenomena can be described by a theoretical model in which the periodic moiré potential is much stronger than the exciton kinetic energy and generates multiple flat exciton minibands. The moiré exciton bands provide an attractive platform from which to explore and control excited states of matter, such as topological excitons and a correlated exciton Hubbard model, in transition-metal dichalcogenides."
https://openalex.org/W2916647762,"Immunologic responses to anti-PD-1 therapy in melanoma patients occur rapidly with pharmacodynamic T cell responses detectable in blood by 3 weeks. It is unclear, however, whether these early blood-based observations translate to the tumor microenvironment. We conducted a study of neoadjuvant/adjuvant anti-PD-1 therapy in stage III/IV melanoma. We hypothesized that immune reinvigoration in the tumor would be detectable at 3 weeks and that this response would correlate with disease-free survival. We identified a rapid and potent anti-tumor response, with 8 of 27 patients experiencing a complete or major pathological response after a single dose of anti-PD-1, all of whom remain disease free. These rapid pathologic and clinical responses were associated with accumulation of exhausted CD8 T cells in the tumor at 3 weeks, with reinvigoration in the blood observed as early as 1 week. Transcriptional analysis demonstrated a pretreatment immune signature (neoadjuvant response signature) that was associated with clinical benefit. In contrast, patients with disease recurrence displayed mechanisms of resistance including immune suppression, mutational escape, and/or tumor evolution. Neoadjuvant anti-PD-1 treatment is effective in high-risk resectable stage III/IV melanoma. Pathological response and immunological analyses after a single neoadjuvant dose can be used to predict clinical outcome and to dissect underlying mechanisms in checkpoint blockade."
https://openalex.org/W2916627756,"Cultivated strawberry emerged from the hybridization of two wild octoploid species, both descendants from the merger of four diploid progenitor species into a single nucleus more than 1 million years ago. Here we report a near-complete chromosome-scale assembly for cultivated octoploid strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa) and uncovered the origin and evolutionary processes that shaped this complex allopolyploid. We identified the extant relatives of each diploid progenitor species and provide support for the North American origin of octoploid strawberry. We examined the dynamics among the four subgenomes in octoploid strawberry and uncovered the presence of a single dominant subgenome with significantly greater gene content, gene expression abundance, and biased exchanges between homoeologous chromosomes, as compared with the other subgenomes. Pathway analysis showed that certain metabolomic and disease-resistance traits are largely controlled by the dominant subgenome. These findings and the reference genome should serve as a powerful platform for future evolutionary studies and enable molecular breeding in strawberry. Chromosome-scale assembly for the cultivated octoploid strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa) uncovers the origin and evolutionary processes that shaped this complex allopolyploid, providing a useful resource for genome-wide analyses and molecular breeding."
https://openalex.org/W2917263971,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the leading cause of respiratory mortality worldwide. Genetic risk loci provide new insights into disease pathogenesis. We performed a genome-wide association study in 35,735 cases and 222,076 controls from the UK Biobank and additional studies from the International COPD Genetics Consortium. We identified 82 loci associated with P < 5 × 10-8; 47 of these were previously described in association with either COPD or population-based measures of lung function. Of the remaining 35 new loci, 13 were associated with lung function in 79,055 individuals from the SpiroMeta consortium. Using gene expression and regulation data, we identified functional enrichment of COPD risk loci in lung tissue, smooth muscle, and several lung cell types. We found 14 COPD loci shared with either asthma or pulmonary fibrosis. COPD genetic risk loci clustered into groups based on associations with quantitative imaging features and comorbidities. Our analyses provide further support for the genetic susceptibility and heterogeneity of COPD."
https://openalex.org/W2916127307,"Bisulfite sequencing has been the gold standard for mapping DNA modifications including 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) for decades1–4. However, this harsh chemical treatment degrades the majority of the DNA and generates sequencing libraries with low complexity2,5,6. Here, we present a bisulfite-free and base-level-resolution sequencing method, TET-assisted pyridine borane sequencing (TAPS), for detection of 5mC and 5hmC. TAPS combines ten-eleven translocation (TET) oxidation of 5mC and 5hmC to 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC) with pyridine borane reduction of 5caC to dihydrouracil (DHU). Subsequent PCR converts DHU to thymine, enabling a C-to-T transition of 5mC and 5hmC. TAPS detects modifications directly with high sensitivity and specificity, without affecting unmodified cytosines. This method is nondestructive, preserving DNA fragments over 10 kilobases long. We applied TAPS to the whole-genome mapping of 5mC and 5hmC in mouse embryonic stem cells and show that, compared with bisulfite sequencing, TAPS results in higher mapping rates, more even coverage and lower sequencing costs, thus enabling higher quality, more comprehensive and cheaper methylome analyses. A new method using mild chemical reactions and enzymatic oxidation allows nondestructive sequencing of 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine with base-level resolution."
https://openalex.org/W2950235747,"Transcriptome-wide association analysis is a powerful approach to studying the genetic architecture of complex traits. A key component of this approach is to build a model to impute gene expression levels from genotypes by using samples with matched genotypes and gene expression data in a given tissue. However, it is challenging to develop robust and accurate imputation models with a limited sample size for any single tissue. Here, we first introduce a multi-task learning method to jointly impute gene expression in 44 human tissues. Compared with single-tissue methods, our approach achieved an average of 39% improvement in imputation accuracy and generated effective imputation models for an average of 120% more genes. We describe a summary-statistic-based testing framework that combines multiple single-tissue associations into a powerful metric to quantify the overall gene-trait association. We applied our method, called UTMOST (unified test for molecular signatures), to multiple genome-wide-association results and demonstrate its advantages over single-tissue strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2892134688,"Insomnia is a common disorder linked with adverse long-term medical and psychiatric outcomes. The underlying pathophysiological processes and causal relationships of insomnia with disease are poorly understood. Here we identified 57 loci for self-reported insomnia symptoms in the UK Biobank (n = 453,379) and confirmed their effects on self-reported insomnia symptoms in the HUNT Study (n = 14,923 cases and 47,610 controls), physician-diagnosed insomnia in the Partners Biobank (n = 2,217 cases and 14,240 controls), and accelerometer-derived measures of sleep efficiency and sleep duration in the UK Biobank (n = 83,726). Our results suggest enrichment of genes involved in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis and of genes expressed in multiple brain regions, skeletal muscle, and adrenal glands. Evidence of shared genetic factors was found between frequent insomnia symptoms and restless legs syndrome, aging, and cardiometabolic, behavioral, psychiatric, and reproductive traits. Evidence was found for a possible causal link between insomnia symptoms and coronary artery disease, depressive symptoms, and subjective well-being."
https://openalex.org/W2917543658,"The mechanistic basis of gliogenesis, which occurs late in human development, is poorly understood. Here we identify nuclear factor IA (NFIA) as a molecular switch inducing human glial competency. Transient expression of NFIA is sufficient to trigger glial competency of human pluripotent stem cell-derived neural stem cells within 5 days and to convert these cells into astrocytes in the presence of glial-promoting factors, as compared to 3–6 months using current protocols. NFIA-induced astrocytes promote synaptogenesis, exhibit neuroprotective properties, display calcium transients in response to appropriate stimuli and engraft in the adult mouse brain. Differentiation involves rapid but reversible chromatin remodeling, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) promoter demethylation and a striking lengthening of the G1 cell cycle phase. Genetic or pharmacological manipulation of G1 length partially mimics NFIA function. We used the approach to generate astrocytes with region-specific or reactive features. Our study defines key mechanisms of the gliogenic switch and enables the rapid production of human astrocytes for disease modeling and regenerative medicine. A new method generates astrocytes from human pluripotent stem cells in 5 days."
https://openalex.org/W2915095776,"Genotoxic DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) can be repaired by error-free homologous recombination (HR) or mutagenic non-homologous end-joining1. HR supresses tumorigenesis1, but is restricted to the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle when a sister chromatid is present2. Breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein (BRCA1) promotes HR by antagonizing the anti-resection factor TP53-binding protein 1(53BP1) (refs. 2–5), but it remains unknown how BRCA1 function is limited to the S and G2 phases. We show that BRCA1 recruitment requires recognition of histone H4 unmethylated at lysine 20 (H4K20me0), linking DSB repair pathway choice directly to sister chromatid availability. We identify the ankyrin repeat domain of BRCA1-associated RING domain protein 1 (BARD1)—the obligate BRCA1 binding partner3—as a reader of H4K20me0 present on new histones in post-replicative chromatin6. BARD1 ankyrin repeat domain mutations disabling H4K20me0 recognition abrogate accumulation of BRCA1 at DSBs, causing aberrant build-up of 53BP1, and allowing anti-resection activity to prevail in S and G2. Consequently, BARD1 recognition of H4K20me0 is required for HR and resistance to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors. Collectively, this reveals that BRCA1–BARD1 monitors the replicative state of the genome to oppose 53BP1 function, routing only DSBs within sister chromatids to HR. Nakamura et al. show that DNA repair pathway choice and initiation of homologous recombination is guided by the recruitment of BRCA1 to post-replicative chromatin by BARD1 recognition of histone H4 tails unmethylated on lysine 20."

https://openalex.org/W2917856590,"Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR T-cell) therapy has been shown to be clinically effective for managing a variety of hematological cancers. However, CAR T-cell therapy is associated with multiple adverse effects, including neurotoxicity and cytokine release syndrome (CRS). CRS arises from massive cytokine secretion and can be life-threatening, but it is typically managed with an anti-IL-6Ra mAb or glucocorticoid administration. However, these treatments add to a patient’s medication burden and address only the CRS symptoms. Therefore, alternative strategies that can prevent CRS and neurotoxicity associated with CAR T-cell treatment are urgently needed. Here, we explored a therapeutic route aimed at preventing CRS rather than limiting its consequences. Using a cytokine-profiling assay, we show that granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF) is a key CRS-promoting protein. Through a combination of in vitro experiments and gene-editing technology, we further demonstrate that antibody-mediated neutralization or TALEN-mediated genetic inactivation of GMCSF in CAR T-cells drastically decreases available GMCSF and abolishes macrophage-dependent secretion of CRS biomarkers, including monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), interleukin (IL) 6, and IL-8. Of note, we also found that the genetic inactivation of GMCSF does not impair the antitumor function or proliferative capacity of CAR T-cells in vitro. We conclude that it is possible to prevent CRS by using “all-in-one” GMCSF-knockout CAR T-cells.

Thus, alternative strategies are needed to control CRS symptoms better or even to prevent CRS in patients receiving CAR T-cell therapies. In this study, we demonstrate that GMCSF secretion by tumor-activated CAR T-cells plays a key role in monocyte activation and in the secretion of CRS biomarkers. Armed with this knowledge, we developed a straightforward and drug-free strategy to prevent CRS during CAR T-cell therapy through the development of GMCSF-knockout CAR T-cells. To study the complex interplay between CAR T-cells, tumor cells, and monocytes that generate CRS biomarkers, we developed a transwell co-culture assay with engineered CAR T-cells obtained though targeted insertion of an anti-CD22 CAR cassette under the control of TCR (Figs. S1 and S2) (19Valton J. Guyot V. Boldajipour B. Sommer C. Pertel T. Juillerat A. Duclert A. Sasu B.J. Duchateau P. Poirot L. A versatile safeguard for chimeric antigen receptor T-cell immunotherapies.Sci. Rep. 2018; 8 (29895885)897210.1038/s41598-018-27264-wCrossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 39Eyquem J.

Using multiplex human inflammation cytokine measurements, we observed obvious differences in the cytokines produced by CAR T-cells and monocytes in the context of the transwell assay (Fig. S3). Indeed, CAR T-cells produced TNFα, GMCSF, IL-8, IL-10, soluble CD40L, and CD25, whereas the monocytes produced IL-6, PTX3, and MCP-1 (Fig. S3). No cytokines were detected in the absence of tumor cells or in the absence of T-cells (Fig. S5 and data not shown). Thus, upon tumor engagement, CAR T-cells secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines such as GMCSF and IL-8, which promote the release of the major CRS biomarker IL-6 as well as MCP-1 and IL-8, cytokines that were previously shown to be monocyte-dependent (9Singh N. Hofmann T.J. Gershenson Z. Levine B.L. Grupp S.A. Teachey D.T. Barrett D.M. Monocyte lineage–derived IL-6 does not affect chimeric antigen receptor T-cell function.Cytotherapy. 2017; 19 (28506444): 867-88010.1016/j.jcyt.2017.04.001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). CRS biomarker release did not depend on physical contact between CAR T-cells and monocytes, suggesting that it may be possible to prevent CRS by inhibiting soluble factors involved in macrophage activation. To explore a novel therapeutic strategy for preventing the biogenesis of CRS, we focused on GMCSF because GMCSF is specifically up-regulated in a CAR-dependent manner and because it is known as a pro-inflammatory cytokine. Therefore, GMCSF can be either neutralized or deleted in CAR T-cells even before CRS develops. We observed GMCSF secretion as early as 4 h after co-incubation of CAR T-cells with tumor cells, with no other cytokines detected under the experimental conditions (Fig. S4 and data not shown). GMCSF is also known to increase the proliferation and activation of macrophages and blood monocytes, increasing their pro-inflammatory properties during infection (20Becher B. Tugues S. Greter M. GM-CSF: from growth factor to central mediator of tissue inflammation.Immunity. 2016; 45 (27851925): 963-97310.1016/j.immuni.2016.10.026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 21Chen B.D. Clark C.R. Chou T.H.

In addition, GMCSF increases macrophages' responsiveness to CSF-1 (macrophage CSF), further enhancing the proliferation of resident macrophages in tissues. Finally, the GMCSF receptor has been shown to be highly expressed by microglia, brain macrophages, and astrocytes, suggesting that these cells can respond to the cytokines. Although GMCSF levels are low in normal healthy individuals, activated lymphocytes produce elevated GMCSF levels under pathologic conditions such as infection (22Vogel D.Y. Kooij G. Heijnen P.D. Breur M. Peferoen L.A. van der Valk P. de Vries H.E. Amor S. Dijkstra C.D. GM-CSF promotes migration of human monocytes across the blood brain barrier.Eur. J. Immunol. 2015; 45 (25756873): 1808-181910.1002/eji.201444960Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To verify that GMCSF plays a key role in monocyte activation, we first treated human monocytes with recombinant GMCSF protein at various doses and measured IL-6 induction, as a surrogate readout for inflammation. We observed that adding GMCSF alone promoted IL-6 induction starting at 4 h and peaking at 24 h, although no such induction was observed with other recombinant proteins such as TNFα and IL-8 (Fig. S4). Interestingly, neutralizing either GMCSF or GMCSF Ra on monocytes inhibited GMCSF-mediated IL-6 secretion, suggesting that monocyte activation occurs specifically via the GMCSF/GMCSF Ra receptor axis (Fig. S4). We observed no effect on IL-6 induction with the vehicle control or the isotype Ab control. Therefore, our results indicate that GMCSF produced by CAR T-cells promotes CRS–mediator secretion. These findings warrant testing the neutralization Ab against GMCSF as a therapeutic approach. To assess the effect of the GMCSF neutralizing Ab on pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, we performed a transwell assay followed by a multiplex cytokine assay. We first added different amounts of Ab to the lower chambers of the transwell apparatus to assess its effect on GMCSF secreted by CAR T-cells. As expected, the neutralizing Ab was able to decrease GMCSF secretion at low doses, with barely any GMCSF detected at the higher doses tested (Fig. 1). We observed an average of 1,090 pg/ml of GMCSF released without any antibody treatment, which was reduced to 170, 43, and 16 pg/ml of GMCSF upon treatment with 1, 2, and 5 μg/ml of the Ab, respectively. This suggests that CAR T-cell–induced GMCSF can be completely neutralized by higher antibody doses. No significant Ab-mediated toxicity was observed. After validating that GMCSF was neutralized, we performed multiplex assays to analyze different cytokines. No significant effect of neutralizing Ab on the production of key T-cell cytokines such as IFNγ, TNFα, and IL-10 was observed, even at higher doses. However, a significant reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, MCP-1, and IL-8 was observed in an Ab dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1). MCP-1 was found to be significantly lower after treatment with even the lowest tested antibody dose (1 μg/ml). IL-6 and IL-8 were reduced at 1 μg/ml, and a statistically significant reduction was seen at the 2 and 5 μg/ml doses. In addition, the cytokine release was antigen-dependent, as CD22+ KO Raji cells showed no induction of any cytokines, and similar findings were confirmed in Daudi cells, another CD22+ tumor cell line (Fig. S5). These findings suggest that the neutralization of GMCSF can be successfully used to inhibit IL-6 secretion, which is known to cause CRS, and to reduce the production of other pro-inflammatory factors such as MCP-1 and IL-8, cytokines with known roles in immune cell trafficking that have been shown to be elevated in high-grade CRS (23Russo R.C. Garcia C.C. Teixeira M.M. Amaral F.A. The CXCL8/IL-8 chemokine family and its receptors in inflammatory diseases.Expert Rev. Clin. Immunol. 2014; 10 (24678812): 593-61910.1586/1744666X.2014.894886Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 24Deshmane S.L. Kremlev S. Amini S. Sawaya B.E.

To translate these findings into a relevant next-generation CAR T-cell product, we sought to disrupt the GMCSF gene in CAR T-cells. This strategy could have several advantages over the Ab neutralization approach. First, GMCSF reduction in GMCSF KO CAR T-cells prior to CRS onset may be beneficial for patients' safety, as it will avoid any antibody-mediated side effects and because the GMCSF antibody dosing schedule is not yet fully established. In addition, it would avoid Ab treatment, which adds substantial costs and treatment time in a managed care setting. In contrast, the genetic inactivation of GMCSF could be easily incorporated into a CAR T-cell production scheme, with relatively little cost increase. Therefore, we designed and screened two different TALEN molecules targeting exon1 of the GMCSF gene (Tal_1 and Tal_2) in two independent T-cell donors (Fig. 2, A and B). Both TALEN constructs reduced GMCSF levels significantly (98 and 86%, respectively) compared with mock-transfected cells. Consistently, T7E1 analysis confirmed GMCSF knockout at the genomic level (Fig. 2C). We then used these two independent TALEN molecules to engineer GMCSF KO CAR T-cells. We opted to use both reagents in parallel to confirm the validity of our approach by independent constructs. Utilizing the anti-CD22 CAR expression cassette targeting the TCR locus described earlier, we successfully engineered GMCSF KO CAR T-cells by co-transfecting TRAC and GMCSF TALEN mRNAs. We observed no differences in CAR expression among different groups (Fig. 2, D and E). However, GMCSF KO resulted in a 90% reduction in GMCSF secretion by CAR T-cells after 16 h of co-incubation with tumor cells (Fig. 2F). To confirm that GMCSF KO did not impair the proliferation and anti-tumor function of CAR T-cells, we then performed a tumor-mediated proliferation assay and a 24-h anti-tumor assay, respectively (Fig. S6). We observed no change in either the proliferation capacity or anti-tumor properties of CAR T-cells after GMCSF KO in four independent donors treated with two different GMCSF TALEN constructs, suggesting that GMCSF KO does not impair the normal functions of CAR T-cells. We also carried out a serial killing assay to challenge GMCSF KO CAR T-cells with daily doses of tumor cells for six consecutive days. This assay showed similar results, with no impaired activity of GMCSF KO CAR T-cells compared with GMCSF wildtype (WT) cells performed at different effector to target (E/T) cell ratios (Fig. S6). Finally, we observed no difference in the expansion of GMCSF KO CD4 CAR T-cells and GMCSF KO CD8 CAR T-cells (Fig. S6). Because GMCSF KO CAR T-cells proliferate as well as GMCSF WT CAR T-cells and exhibit similar anti-tumor properties, we then subjected these cells to the transwell assay described above. Similar to what was observed in the GMCSF Ab neutralization experiment (Fig. 1), we observed that GMCSF KO CAR T-cells suppressed the secretion of inflammatory cytokines by monocytes. Consistent with our activity tests, GMCSF KO did not impair the production of key CAR T-cell cytokines such as IFNγ. In addition, both TALEN treatments led to a significant reduction in IL-6 and MCP produced by monocytes (Fig. 2G). GMCSF KO also led to a decrease in TNFα, albeit one that was not statistically significant, and no change in IL-8 compared with CAR T-cells with WT GMCSF (Fig. 2G). These data further confirm that GMCSF inhibition in CAR T-cells attenuates the release of several inflammatory cytokines by monocytes and that GMCSF KO can be used to engineer safer but equally effective CAR T-cell–based therapies. Interestingly, while we were preparing our manuscript, another study (25Sterner R.M. Sakemura R. Cox M.J. Yang N. Khadka R.H. Forsman C.L. Hansen M.J. Jin F. Ayasoufi K. Hefazi M. Schick K.J.

Using Crispr/Cas9-mediated gene-editing approach, Sterner et al. (25Sterner R.M. Sakemura R. Cox M.J. Yang N. Khadka R.H. Forsman C.L. Hansen M.J. Jin F. Ayasoufi K. Hefazi M. Schick K.J.

In an independent in vivo model, the authors showed improved overall survival in mice with NALM6 xenografts treated with anti-CD19 GMCSF KO CAR T-cells. Therefore, this study demonstrates the therapeutic potential of GMCSF KO in vivo, further corroborating our findings regarding the CAR T-cell–mediated CRS. In addition, Sentman et al. (26Sentman M.-L. Murad J.M. Cook W.J. Wu M.-R. Reder J. Baumeister S.H. Dranoff G. Fanger M.W. Sentman C.L. Mechanisms of acute toxicity in NKG2D chimeric antigen receptor T cell–treated mice.J.

Therefore, our data on anti-CD22 CAR T-cells along with published data on anti-CD19 and NKG2D CAR T-cells indicate that GMCSF-mediated CRS promotion is unlikely to be an antigen- and/or CAR-dependent phenomenon. Moreover, the role of GMCSF in mediating inflammation is well established in several immune and autoimmune diseases (27Wicks I.P. Roberts A.W. Targeting GM-CSF in inflammatory diseases.Nat. Rev.

Mutations in genes encoding ubiquilins, UBQLN2 and UBQLN4, cause familial ALS. The role of ubiquilins in proteasomal degradation is well established, but their role in autophagy–lysosomal clearance is poorly defined. Here, we describe a crosstalk between endoplasmic reticulum stress, mTOR signalling and autophagic flux in Drosophila and mammalian cells lacking ubiquilins. We found that loss of ubiquilins leads to endoplasmic reticulum stress, impairs mTORC1 activity, promotes autophagy and causes the demise of neurons. We show that ubiquilin mutants display defective autophagic flux due to reduced lysosome acidification. Ubiquilins are required to maintain proper levels of the V0a/V100 subunit of the vacuolar H+-ATPase and lysosomal pH. Feeding flies acidic nanoparticles alleviates defective autophagic flux in ubiquilin mutants. Hence, our studies reveal a conserved role for ubiquilins as regulators of autophagy by controlling vacuolar H+-ATPase activity and mTOR signalling. Şentürk et al. show that ubiquilins bind v-ATPase to control lysosome acidity, mTOR signalling and autophagic flux in neurons, and that feeding flies with acidic nanoparticles ameliorates defective autophagy in ubiquilin mutants."

Here, we report that apical-basal polarity inhibits EMT to suppress metastatic dissemination. Using mouse and human epithelial three-dimensional organoid cultures, we show that the PAR-atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) polarity complex inhibits EMT and invasion by promoting degradation of the SNAIL family protein SNAI1. Under intact apical-basal polarity, aPKC kinases phosphorylate S249 of SNAI1, which leads to protein degradation. Loss of apical-basal polarity prevents aPKC-mediated SNAI1 phosphorylation and stabilizes the SNAI1 protein to promote EMT and invasion. In human breast tumour xenografts, inhibition of the PAR-complex-mediated SNAI1 degradation mechanism promotes tumour invasion and metastasis. Analyses of human breast tissue samples reveal negative correlations between PAR3 and SNAI1 protein levels. Our results demonstrate that apical-basal polarity functions as a critical checkpoint of EMT to precisely control epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity during tumour metastasis."

Here, we build on recent improvements in single-cell calcium imaging combined with optogenetics to test the capacity of PVs and CHIs to affect MSN activity and behavior in mice engaged in voluntary locomotion. We find that PVs and CHIs have unique effects on MSN activity and dissociable roles in supporting movement. PV cells facilitate movement by refining the activation of MSN networks responsible for movement execution. CHIs, in contrast, synchronize activity within MSN networks to signal the end of a movement bout. These results provide new insights into the striatal network activity that supports movement."

Distinct subpopulations of MeApv-D1R neurons differentially innervate the ventromedial hypothalamus and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and these projections have opposing effects on investigation or avoidance of threatening stimuli. These projections are potently modulated through opposite actions of D1R signaling that bias approach behavior.

Heterozygous loss-of-function point mutations of miRNA genes are associated with several human congenital disorders1–5, but neomorphic (gain-of-new-function) mutations in miRNAs due to nucleotide substitutions have not been reported. Here we describe a neomorphic seed region mutation in the chondrocyte-specific, super-enhancer-associated MIR140 gene encoding microRNA-140 (miR-140) in a novel autosomal dominant human skeletal dysplasia. Mice with the corresponding single nucleotide substitution show skeletal abnormalities similar to those of the patients but distinct from those of miR-140-null mice6. This mutant miRNA gene yields abundant mutant miR-140-5p expression without miRNA-processing defects. In chondrocytes, the mutation causes widespread derepression of wild-type miR-140-5p targets and repression of mutant miR-140-5p targets, indicating that the mutation produces both loss-of-function and gain-of-function effects. Furthermore, the mutant miR-140-5p seed competes with the conserved RNA-binding protein Ybx1 for overlapping binding sites. This finding may explain the potent target repression and robust in vivo effect by this mutant miRNA even in the absence of evolutionary selection of miRNA–target RNA interactions, which contributes to the strong regulatory effects of conserved miRNAs7,8. Our study presents the first case of a pathogenic gain-of-function miRNA mutation and provides molecular insight into neomorphic actions of emerging and/or mutant miRNAs.

Differentiated mESCs exhibited distinct profiles, which were also conserved among cells. Haplotype-resolved scRepli-seq revealed similar replication profiles of homologous autosomes, while the inactive X chromosome was clearly replicated later than its active counterpart. However, a small degree of cell-to-cell replication-timing heterogeneity was present, which was smallest at the beginning and the end of S phase. In addition, developmentally regulated domains were found to deviate from others and showed a higher degree of heterogeneity, thus suggesting a link to developmental plasticity. Moreover, allelic expression imbalance was found to strongly associate with replication-timing asynchrony.

Enhanced HIF-2 activity drives some cancers, whereas reduced activity causes anemia in chronic kidney disease. Therefore, modulation of HIF-2 activity via direct-binding ligands could provide many new therapeutic benefits. Here, we explored HIF-2α chemical ligands using combined crystallographic, biophysical, and cell-based functional studies. We found chemically unrelated antagonists to employ the same mechanism of action. Their binding displaced residue M252 from inside the HIF-2α PAS-B pocket toward the ARNT subunit to weaken heterodimerization. We also identified first-in-class HIF-2α agonists and found that they significantly displaced pocket residue Y281. Its dramatic side chain movement increases heterodimerization stability and transcriptional activity. Our findings show that despite binding to the same HIF-2α PAS-B pocket, ligands can manifest as inhibitors versus activators by mobilizing different pocket residues to allosterically alter HIF-2α–ARNT heterodimerization.

https://openalex.org/W2915302836,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules that play an important role in the regulation of gene expression related to inflammatory responses. Human adipose stem cells are characterized by pluripotent differentiation potential and isolated from adipose tissues. These cells regulate inflammation mainly by interacting with immune cells and affecting the secretion of immune factors; details of this interaction are currently unknown. In the current study, we successfully established an acute inflammation model and a chronic inflammation model involving adipose stem cells. We used high-throughput miRNA microarray analysis to identify miRNAs that were significantly (p < 0.05) differentially expressed during both acute and chronic inflammation. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the expression of miR-223-3P and miR-2909, while promoting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL) 6, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α via the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4/TLR2/nuclear factor (NF)-κB/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 signaling pathway in human adipose stem cells. Further, miR-223-3P expression was significantly (p < 0.05) reduced in human adipose stem cells during activation by IL-6 stimulation. The inducible down-regulation of miR-223-3P resulted in the activation of STAT3, which was directly targeted by miR-223-3P. STAT3 directly targeted TLR4 and TLR2, promoting the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-6, and formed a positive feedback loop to regulate IL-6 levels. Similarly, TNF-α significantly (p < 0.05) increased the expression of miR-223-3p, with LPS and TLR4/TLR2/NF-κB/STAT3 forming a negative feedback loop to regulate TNF-α levels. In addition, miR-2909, which depends on NF-κB, targeted Krueppel-like factor (KLF) 4 to regulate the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α. We conclude that miR-223-3p and miR-2909 form a complex regulatory network with pro-inflammatory factors and signaling pathways in adipose stem cells stimulated by LPS. These findings will inform the development of therapies against autoimmune and inflammatory diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2917925169,"Exome analysis of patients with a likely monogenic disease does not identify a causal variant in over half of cases. Splice-disrupting mutations make up the second largest class of known disease-causing mutations. Each individual (singleton) exome harbors over 500 rare variants of unknown significance (VUS) in the splicing region. The existing relevant pathogenicity prediction tools tackle all non-coding variants as one amorphic class and/or are not calibrated for the high sensitivity required for clinical use. Here we calibrate seven such tools and devise a novel tool called Splicing Clinically Applicable Pathogenicity prediction (S-CAP) that is over twice as powerful as all previous tools, removing 41% of patient VUS at 95% sensitivity. We show that S-CAP does this by using its own features and not via meta-prediction over previous tools, and that splicing pathogenicity prediction is distinct from predicting molecular splicing changes. S-CAP is an important step on the path to deriving non-coding causal diagnoses. S-CAP is an RNA-splicing pathogenicity–prediction tool that can eliminate 41% of variants of unknown significance at 95% sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W2916884534,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) has long been known for its tight association with chronic inflammation, thought to play a key role in tumor onset and malignant progression through the modulation of cancer stemness. However, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms are still largely elusive. Here we show that the IL-6/STAT3 inflammatory signaling axis induces the deacetylation of FRA1 at the Lys-116 residue located within its DNA-binding domain. The HDAC6 deacetylase underlies this key modification leading to the increase of FRA1 transcriptional activity, the subsequent transactivation of NANOG expression, and the acquisition of stem-like cellular features. As validated in a large (n = 123) CRC cohort, IL-6 secretion was invariably accompanied by increased FRA1 deacetylation at K116 and an overall increase in its protein levels, coincident with malignant progression and poor prognosis. Of note, combined treatment with the conventional cytotoxic drug 5-FU together with Tubastatin A, a HDAC6-specific inhibitor, resulted in a significant in vivo synergistic inhibitory effect on tumor growth through suppression of CRC stemness. Our results reveal a novel transcriptional and posttranslational regulatory cross-talk between inflammation and stemness signaling pathways that underlie self-renewal and maintenance of CRC stem cells and promote their malignant behavior. Combinatorial treatment aimed at the core regulatory mechanisms downstream of IL-6 may offer a novel promising approach for CRC treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2916220463,"Safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.) is a multipurpose crop of dry land yielding very high quality of edible oil. Present study was aimed to investigate the genetic diversity and population structure of 131 safflower accessions originating from 28 different countries using 13 iPBS-retrotransposon markers. A total of 295 iPBS bands were observed among which 275 (93.22%) were found polymorphic. Mean Polymorphism information content (0.48) and diversity parameters including mean effective number of alleles (1.33), mean Shannon's information index (0.33), overall gene diversity (0.19), Fstatistic (0.21), and inbreeding coefficient (1.00) reflected the presence of sufficient amount of genetic diversity in the studied plant materials. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed that more than 40% of genetic variation was derived from populations. Model-based structure, principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic means (UPGMA) algorithms clustered the 131 safflower accessions into four main populations A, B, C, D and an unclassified population, with no meaningful geographical origin. Most diverse accessions originated from Asian countries including Afghanistan, Pakistan, China, Turkey, and India. Four accessions, Turkey3, Afghanistan4, Afghanistan2, and Pakistan24 were found most genetically distant and might be recommended as a candidate parents for breeding purposes. The findings of this study are most probably supported by the seven similarity centers hypothesis of safflower. This is a first study to explore the genetic diversity and population structure in safflower accessions using the iPBS-retrotransposon markers. The information provided in this work will therefore be helpful for scientists interested in safflower breeding."

However, the structural and functional consequences of these perturbations remain largely unexplored. Here, we examined the impact of isomerization of aspartic acid or epimerization of serine at four sites mapping to crucial oligomeric interfaces in human αA- and αB-crystallin, the most abundant chaperone proteins in the eye lens. To characterize the effect of isomerization on quaternary assembly, we utilized synthetic peptide mimics, enzyme assays, molecular dynamics calculations, and native MS experiments. The oligomerization of recombinant forms of αA- and αB-crystallin that mimic isomerized residues deviated from native behavior in all cases. Isomerization also perturbs recognition of peptide substrates, either enhancing or inhibiting kinase activity. Specifically, epimerization of serine (αASer-162) dramatically weakened inter-subunit binding. Furthermore, phosphorylation of αBSer-59, known to play an important regulatory role in oligomerization, was severely inhibited by serine epimerization and altered by isomerization of nearby αBAsp-62.

https://openalex.org/W2915995639,"The Bunyavirales order of segmented negative-sense RNA viruses includes more than 500 isolates that infect insects, animals, and plants and are often associated with severe and fatal disease in humans. To multiply and cause disease, bunyaviruses must translocate their genomes from outside the cell into the cytosol, achieved by transit through the endocytic network. We have previously shown that the model bunyaviruses Bunyamwera virus (BUNV) and Hazara virus (HAZV) exploit the changing potassium concentration ([K+]) of maturing endosomes to release their genomes at the appropriate endosomal location. K+ was identified as a biochemical cue to activate the viral fusion machinery, promoting fusion between viral and cellular membranes, consequently permitting genome release. In this study, we further define the biochemical prerequisites for BUNV and HAZV entry and their K+ dependence. Using drug-mediated cholesterol extraction along with viral entry and K+ uptake assays, we report three major findings: BUNV and HAZV require cellular cholesterol during endosomal escape; cholesterol depletion from host cells impairs K+ accumulation in maturing endosomes, revealing new insights into endosomal K+ homeostasis; and “priming” BUNV and HAZV virions with K+ before infection alleviates their cholesterol requirement. Taken together, our findings suggest a model in which cholesterol abundance influences endosomal K+ levels and, consequently, the efficiency of bunyavirus infection.

The order Bunyavirales represents the largest taxonomic collection of single-stranded, negative-sense RNA viruses, with over 500 named isolates classified into 10 families and 35 genera (1Wolf Y.

Bunyaviruses infect a wide range of hosts, including animals, plants, insects, and humans. Viruses able to infect humans are classified into just four of the Bunyavirales families, Hantaviridae, Phenuiviridae, Nairoviridae, and Peribunyaviridae, with selected species able to cause potentially fatal hemorrhagic fever or encephalitis in their human hosts (2Soldan S.S.

In many bunyavirus species, an additional nonstructural protein (NSs) is expressed from the S segment either from an overlapping ORF on the N mRNA or, alternatively, via generation of a discrete mRNA through ambisense transcription (3Elliott R.M.

For bunyaviruses to establish infection, they must penetrate host cells and traverse the endocytic network prior to escape of viral RNPs into the cytosol and subsequent gene expression. Cell penetration of bunyaviruses occurs through attachment of the virus to the cell, followed by internalization through a range of mechanisms. It is known that viruses of the families Hantaviridae, Nairoviridae, and Peribunyaviridae are endocytosed through a clathrin-dependent mechanism, with functional roles for caveolar endocytosis and macropinocytosis also described. Conversely, viruses of the Phenuiviridae enter cells independently of clathrin (7Simon M. Johansson C. Mirazimi A.

When inside endosomes, bunyaviruses must facilitate the escape of their RNPs into the cytosol, a process involving fusion of the virus envelope with the endosomal membrane. This fusion event is mediated by the heteromultimeric glycoprotein spikes comprising Gn and Gc, arranged on the surface of mature virions in a variety of different architectures (11Garry C.E. Garry R.F. Proteomics computational analyses suggest that the carboxyl terminal glycoproteins of bunyaviruses are class II viral fusion protein (β-penetrenes).Theor. Biol. Med.

Sindbis virus glycoproteins form a regular icosahedral surface lattice.J. Virol. 1975; 16 (48559): 141-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the fusion machinery to be activated, the glycoprotein spikes must be subjected to a variety of specific biochemical events that can occur before or after their inclusion in the virion. For instance, most class I and II fusion proteins studied to date require a proteolytic cleavage event to become fusion-competent (15Harrison S.C. Viral membrane fusion.Virology. 2015; 479-480: 498-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). This event is termed “priming,” after which a variety of further events, known as “triggers,” induce structural changes in the fusion proteins, resulting in a transition between pre- and post-fusion conformations. Although the priming step involves proteolysis, there is a greater variety of triggers, including pH and interactions with an internal or external cellular receptor. These triggering events ensure that fusion between viral and cellular membranes is restricted to an appropriate cellular location that leads to productive infection (15Harrison S.C. Viral membrane fusion.Virology. 2015; 479-480: 498-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Recently, we used the prototypic bunyavirus Bunyamwera virus (BUNV) and the model nairovirus Hazara virus (HAZV) to reveal that bunyavirus fusion depends on specific changes in both pH and ion balance (16Hover S. Foster B. Fontana J. Kohl A. Goldstein S.A.N. Barr J.N. Mankouri J. Bunyavirus requirement for endosomal K+ reveals new roles of cellular ion channels during infection.PLoS Pathog. 2018; 14 (29352299): e100684510.1371/journal.ppat.1006845Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 17Punch E.K.

Specifically, we identified K+ as a critical biochemical trigger required for spike conformational changes and interaction with membranes, consistent with activation of the fusogenic machinery. Although this work documented how bunyavirus glycoproteins respond to specific endosomal conditions, it is likely that efficient fusion between virus and endosomal membranes requires other biochemical factors, such as specific vesicle lipid environments and/or endosomal receptors. In this regard, it is known that the composition of biological membranes is crucial for the physiological function of cells and that cholesterol is an important regulator of membrane integrity and fluidity, making up 25–50% of the total lipid content of animal cells (18Song Y. Kenworthy A.K. Sanders C.R. Cholesterol as a co-solvent and a ligand for membrane proteins.Protein Sci. 2014; 23 (24155031): 1-2210.1002/pro.2385Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Aberrations in cholesterol homeostasis can disrupt cellular uptake mechanisms, which is important from the view of enveloped viruses. The correct composition of biological membranes in terms of cholesterol has been shown to be important to the life cycle of several enveloped viruses, in a variety of life cycle stages ranging from entry to release. As well as the correct environmental pH, the Togaviridae family member Semliki Forest virus requires high cholesterol composition in target membranes for stable insertion of its fusion loop (19Phalen T. Kielian M. Cholesterol is required for infection by Semliki Forest virus.J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112 (1671572): 615-62310.1083/jcb.112.4.615Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), whereas the hantavirus Andes virus (ANDV) has been demonstrated to require high cholesterol in target membranes for productive infection (20Kleinfelter L.M. Jangra R.K. Jae L.T. Herbert A.S. Mittler E. Stiles K.M. Wirchnianski A.S. Kielian M. Brummelkamp T.R. Dye J.M. Chandran K. Haploid genetic screen reveals a profound and direct dependence on cholesterol for Hantavirus membrane fusion.MBio. 2015; 6 (26126854): e00801Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Cholesterol concentrations also influence the hemifusion stage of influenza virus fusion (21Chlanda P. Mekhedov E. Waters H. Schwartz C.L. Fischer E.R. Ryham R.J. Cohen F.S. Blank P.S. Zimmerberg J. The hemifusion structure induced by influenza virus haemagglutinin is determined by physical properties of the target membranes.Nat. Microbiol. 2016; 1 (27572837): 1605010.1038/nmicrobiol.2016.50Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Aside from the entry stages of viral life cycles, cholesterol has been shown to be important in the assembly and release of mature influenza virus virions, which require cholesterol to stabilize virions prior to release (22Bajimaya S. Frankl T. Hayashi T. Takimoto T. Cholesterol is required for stability and infectivity of influenza A and respiratory syncytial viruses.Virology. 2017; 510 (28750327): 234-24110.1016/j.virol.2017.07.024Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined how the biochemical composition of both host and viral membranes influences the crucial fusion step in the bunyavirus life cycle. We reveal new insights into the role of cholesterol during virion endocytic trafficking and endosomal K+ accumulation. Given that enveloped viruses must fuse their outer membranes with host membranes to cause infection (23White J.M. Whittaker G.R. Fusion of enveloped viruses in endosomes.Traffic. 2016; 17 (26935856): 593-61410.1111/tra.12389Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), we first examined whether cholesterol, a key regulator of membrane fluidity (24Cooper R.A. Influence of increased membrane cholesterol on membrane fluidity and cell function in human red blood cells.J. Supramol. Struct. 1978; 8 (723275): 413-43010.1002/jss.400080404Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), has a role in this process. Cholesterol-rich microdomains within the plasma membrane are important for the life cycle of a range of enveloped viruses, but their role during the bunyavirus life cycle is poorly characterized. In the following experiments, cellular cholesterol was extracted from the plasma membrane of BUNV-susceptible A549 cells using methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD), and its influence on BUNV infection was assessed (Fig. 1). Cells were treated with MβCD for 45 min to sequester cellular cholesterol and incubated with BUNV (m.o.i. 0.2) for 2 h to permit virus penetration. Noninternalized viruses were removed 2 h post-infection (hpi) through trypsin washing, and the ability of BUNV to establish an infection after 24 h was assessed through detection of BUNV-N by immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 1, A and B). Quantification of cells positive for BUNV-N revealed significantly reduced levels of infection upon MβCD treatment (reduction to ∼19%) (Fig. 1B, black columns). When BUNV infection was assessed at varying concentrations of MβCD (0.5–2 mm) by Western blotting (Fig. 1, C and D), N expression was barely detectable at 0.5–1 mm and completely undetectable at 2 mm MβCD (Fig. 1C), revealing a concentration-dependent decrease (Fig. 1D, black columns). Importantly, MβCD treatment was noncytotoxic, as evidenced through MTS assays (Fig. 1, B and D, gray columns) and the equivalent levels of GAPDH in the corresponding protein lysates (Fig. 1C). To confirm the BUNV cholesterol requirement, the effects of PF-429242 (an S1P/SKI-1 inhibitor) (25Hawkins J.L. Robbins M.D. Warren L.C. Xia D. Petras S.F. Valentine J.J. Varghese A.H. Wang I.-K.

For these experiments, cells were pretreated with PF-429242 for 24 h (31Elgner F. Ren H. Medvedev R. Ploen D. Himmelsbach K. Boller K. Hildt E. The intracellular cholesterol transport inhibitor U18666A inhibits the exosome-dependent release of mature hepatitis C virus.J.

Ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), a known inhibitor of BUNV fusion, was included in these assays as a positive control (16Hover S. Foster B. Fontana J. Kohl A. Goldstein S.A.N. Barr J.N. Mankouri J. Bunyavirus requirement for endosomal K+ reveals new roles of cellular ion channels during infection.PLoS Pathog. 2018; 14 (29352299): e100684510.1371/journal.ppat.1006845Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). PF-429242 at 20 μm resulted in almost complete abrogation of BUNV-N production, whereas 5–10 μm led to drastically reduced BUNV-N expression (Fig. 1E). Quantification revealed that the BUNV-N levels decreased to 7.91%, 17.54%, and 37.94% in 20, 10, and 5 μm drug-treated cells, respectively, compared with the no-drug control (Fig. 1F, black columns). MTS assays revealed no detrimental effects of PF-429242 on cell viability (Fig. 1F, gray columns). For further confirmation, cells were treated with U-18666A under identical conditions (26Cenedella R.J. Cholesterol synthesis inhibitor U18666A and the role of sterol metabolism and trafficking in numerous pathophysiological processes.Lipids. 2009; 44 (19440746): 477-48710.1007/s11745-009-3305-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Fig. 1G shows strong inhibition of BUNV in cells treated with 5–10 μm U-18666A and more modest inhibition at 2.5 μm U-18666A. Upon quantification (Fig. 1H, black columns), BUNV-N expression was reduced to 8.52%, 22.83%, and 42.66% by 10, 5, and 2.5 μm U18666A, respectively. MTS assays confirmed no loss of viability at the U18666A concentrations assessed (Fig. 1H, gray columns). Finally, we assessed cholesterol depletion as a viable anti-BUNV strategy through assessment of the inhibitory effects of the clinically approved cholesterol-lowering drug simvastatin. Fig. 1, I and J, shows that BUNV-N expression was reduced by 50, 35, 20, and 10 μm simvastatin treatment to 24.74%, 34.29%, 38.82%, and 48.37%, respectively, when normalized to no-drug controls. MTS assays confirmed no drug-induced cytotoxicity (Fig. 1J, gray columns). Taken together, these data, obtained via four independent methods, strongly suggest that cholesterol is important during the BUNV life cycle and that clinically approved cholesterol-lowering drugs hold promise as a clinically available antiviral strategy. As BUNV is an enveloped virus, we next assessed whether envelope cholesterol contributed to the effects of cholesterol-lowering compounds. To assess this, we used a recombinant BUNV containing GFP inserted at the N terminus of a truncated Gc glycoprotein (GFP-Gc) with the deleted sequence shown to be dispensable for virus infection in cell culture (32Shi X. van Mierlo J.T. French A. Elliott R.M. Visualizing the replication cycle of Bunyamwera orthobunyavirus expressing fluorescent protein-tagged Gc glycoprotein.J.

GFP-BUNV virions were treated in vitro with MβCD for 90 min at 37 °C to sequester cholesterol from the virion membrane (Fig. 2A). To mitigate the effects of MβCD on the cells, virions were diluted in medium prior to infection (m.o.i. 0.5, 24 h). This ensured that any effects of cholesterol depletion were mediated by direct effects on the virions as opposed to cellular effects.Figure 1.BUNV infection is inhibited by cellular cholesterol depletion. A, A549 cells were treated with MβCD for 45 min and infected with BUNV (m.o.i. 0.2). At 24 hpi, cells were fixed and stained for BUNV-N.

Upon assessment of GFP-Gc fluorescence (32Shi X. van Mierlo J.T. French A. Elliott R.M. Visualizing the replication cycle of Bunyamwera orthobunyavirus expressing fluorescent protein-tagged Gc glycoprotein.J. Virol. 2010; 84 (20573824): 8460-846910.1128/JVI.00902-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2D), a larger, ∼60% decrease in the number of infected cells was observed (Fig. 2E). This confirmed that MβCD virion treatment decreased the number of infected cells. The ultrastructure of BUNV virions was unaffected by cholesterol depletion, as negative staining showed no gross structural defects in the virions following MβCD treatment (Fig. 2F). We therefore reasoned that BUNV infection depends on virion as well as cellular associated cholesterol. To further dissect the role of cholesterol during BUNV infection and identify the steps at which MβCD-mediated cholesterol extraction inhibits the virus life cycle, time-of-addition assays were performed. We included NH4Cl as a control, an endosomal acidification inhibitor that inhibits BUNV at early stages of infection, i.e. only during its movement through the endocytic system (16Hover S. Foster B. Fontana J. Kohl A. Goldstein S.A.N. Barr J.N. Mankouri J. Bunyavirus requirement for endosomal K+ reveals new roles of cellular ion channels during infection.PLoS Pathog. 2018; 14 (29352299): e100684510.1371/journal.ppat.1006845Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Cells were infected with BUNV (m.o.i. 0.2, t = 0), and NH4Cl or MβCD was added to cells at defined time points up to and including 10 hpi. Infection was then allowed to proceed until 24 hpi, and BUNV-N expression was assessed (Fig. 3, A and B). Fig. 3, A and C, shows that BUNV escapes from endosomes at or before 6 hpi, as NH4Cl treatment did not influence BUNV-N production when added at 6 hpi or later, consistent with our previous findings (16Hover S. Foster B. Fontana J. Kohl A. Goldstein S.A.N. Barr J.N. Mankouri J. Bunyavirus requirement for endosomal K+ reveals new roles of cellular ion channels during infection.PLoS Pathog. 2018; 14 (29352299): e100684510.1371/journal.ppat.1006845Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Interestingly, BUNV sensitivity to MβCD followed a similar time course (loss of inhibition from 6–8 hpi; Fig. 3, B and C), suggesting that MβCD also inhibits BUNV early stages of infection. Next, using tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) to distinguish internalized and surface-bound particles, we assessed the kinetics of BUNV cell penetration. TCEP is a membrane-impermeable reducing agent that inactivates BUNV exposed extracellularly or at the plasma membrane. We observed loss of TCEP inhibition when added 40 min post-virus addition, as assessed by immunofluorescence (Fig. 4, D and E) and Western blot analysis (Fig. 4F). Taking into account the NH4Cl effects on BUNV, this confirmed that BUNV is resident in the endosomal system from 40 min to 6 h post-infection. Importantly, an effect of cholesterol depletion on BUNV cell penetration was discounted, as we observed fluorescently labeled BUNV (BUNV-DiDvbt/SYTO82), in which the viral envelope was labeled with DiDvbt and its RNA genome was labeled with SYTO82 in distinct endosomal puncta in cells treated with MβCD, suggesting that BUNV can penetrate cells depleted of cholesterol (Fig. 3, D and E). These data suggest that the critical role of cholesterol in the BUNV life cycle occurs at a post-penetration (≥40 min) endocytic stage (≤6 h), in agreement with that observed for other enveloped viruses (35Sun X. Whittaker G.R. Role for influenza virus envelope cholesterol in virus entry and infection.J. Virol. 2003; 77 (14610177): 12543-1255110.1128/JVI.77.23.12543-12551.2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar).Figure 4.MβCD inhibits endosomal K+ accumulation, whereas K+-primed BUNV virions can overcome cellular cholesterol depletion.

https://openalex.org/W2916668400,"As a master regulator for metabolic and energy homeostasis, AMPK controls the activity of metabolic enzymes and transcription factors in response to cellular ATP status. AMPK has been thus recognized as a main target for the regulation of cellular energy metabolism. Here, we report that AMPK can be down-regulated by the cullin-RING ubiquitin E3 ligase 4A (CRL4A) with cereblon (CRBN). CRL4A interacted with AMPK holoenzymes and mediated AMPKα-specific polyubiquitination for its proteasomal degradation through non-K48 polyubiquitin linkages. In the ubiquitination system, CRBN was required for efficient polyubiquitination of AMPKα subunits. Consistently, polyubiquitination of AMPKα subunits was reduced by inhibitors of CRL4A-CRBN. Physiologic function of AMPK down-regulation by CRL4-CRBN was also confirmed using mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs). The inactivation of CRL4A-CRBN in BMMC increased AMPK stability and suppressed secretion of allergic mediators via AMPK activation followed by MAPK inhibition. In addition, CRBN knockout of BMMC also decreased allergic responses in mice. Our results suggest that the CRL4A-CRBN axis could be a target for the regulation of AMPK-dependent responses.-Kwon, E., Li, X., Deng, Y., Chang, H. W., Kim, D. Y. AMPK is down-regulated by the CRL4A-CRBN axis through the polyubiquitination of AMPKα isoforms."

Polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4) is a Ser/Thr protein kinase and the master regulator of centriole duplication, but it may play additional roles in centrosome function. To identify additional proteins regulated by PLK4, we generated an RPE-1 human cell line with a genetically engineered “analog-sensitive” PLK4AS, which genetically encodes chemical sensitivity to competitive inhibition via a bulky ATP analog. We used this transgenic line in an unbiased multiplex phosphoproteomic screen. Several hits were identified and validated as direct PLK4 substrates by in vitro kinase assays. Among them, we confirmed Ser-78 in centrosomal protein 131 (CEP131, also known as AZI1) as a direct substrate of PLK4. Using immunofluorescence microscopy, we observed that although PLK4-mediated phosphorylation of Ser-78 is dispensable for CEP131 localization, ciliogenesis, and centriole duplication, it is essential for maintaining the integrity of centriolar satellites. We also found that PLK4 inhibition or use of a nonphosphorylatable CEP131 variant results in dispersed centriolar satellites. Moreover, replacement of endogenous WT CEP131 with an S78D phosphomimetic variant promoted aggregation of centriolar satellites.

We investigated the relationship between residents' health and social care costs and severity of agitation based on the CMAI total score. In addition, we assessed resource utilisation and compared costs of residents with and without clinically significant symptoms of agitation using the CMAI over and above the cost of the care home.Agitation defined by the CMAI was a significant predictor of costs. On average, a one-point increase in the CMAI will lead to a 0.5 percentage points (cost ratio 1.005, 95%CI 1.001 to 1.010) increase in the annual costs. The excess annual cost associated with agitation per resident with dementia was £1,125.35. This suggests that, on average, agitation accounts for 44% of the annual health and social care costs of dementia in people living in care homes.Agitation in people with dementia living in care homes contributes significantly to the overall costs increasing as the level of agitation increases. Residents with the highest level of agitation cost nearly twice as much as those with the lowest levels of agitation, suggesting that effective strategies to reduce agitation are likely to be cost-effective in this setting."

Non-enzymatic proteins from snake venoms: a gold mine of pharmacological tools and drug leads.Toxicon. 2013; 62 (23058997): 56-7410.1016/j.toxicon.2012.09.008Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Over the past few decades, neurotoxins from snake venoms have been confirmed to have potential applications in pain control. Mambalgins are a new class of three-finger peptides from black mamba venom that can block pain via suppression of acid-sensing ion channel currents (17Diochot S. Baron A. Salinas M. Douguet D. Scarzello S. Dabert-Gay A.S. Debayle D. Friend V. Alloui A. Lazdunski M. Lingueglia E. Black mamba venom peptides target acid-sensing ion channels to abolish pain.Nature. 2012; 490 (23034652): 552-55510.1038/nature11494Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Crotoxin from the venom of the South American rattlesnake Crotalus durissus terrificus has a long-lasting antinociceptive effect on neuropathic pain, which is mediated by central muscarinic receptors and 5-lipoxygenase–derived mediators (18Nogueira-Neto Fde S. Amorim R.L. Brigatte P. Picolo G. Ferreira Jr, W.A. Gutierrez V.P. Conceição I.M. Della-Casa M.S. Takahira R.K. Nicoletti J.L. Cury Y. The analgesic effect of crotoxin on neuropathic pain is mediated by central muscarinic receptors and 5-lipoxygenase-derived mediators.Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 2008; 91 (18778727): 252-26010.1016/j.pbb.2008.08.016Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Cobratoxin from Naja naja kaouthia is an effective analgesic in rats with neuropathic pain, and this effect involves α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor inhibition (19Gong S. Liang Q. Zhu Q. Ding D. Yin Q. Tao J. Jiang X. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor α7 subunit is involved in the cobratoxin-induced antinociception in an animal model of neuropathic pain.Toxicon. 2015; 93 (25447771): 31-3610.1016/j.toxicon.2014.11.222Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, snake neurotoxins targeting Nav1.8 have not been reported to date. In the present study, by screening new Nav1.8 blockers from snake venoms, we identified μ-EPTX-Na1a (hereafter Na1a) from the venom of Naja atra as a potent and selective Nav1.8 inhibitor. Moreover, this peptide exhibited effective analgesic properties in rodent pain models. Aiming to identify potent and specific inhibitors of Nav1.8, we performed a large-scale screening by using tens of snake venoms and other animal venoms (from spiders, scorpions, and centipedes) and their purified peptide toxins. As a result, a toxin from N. atra venom exhibited potent and specific inhibition. This unique peptide was purified from N. atra venom via a combination of RP-HPLC and anion-exchange RP-HPLC (Fig. 1, A, B, and C), and the molecular mass of the peptide was determined to be 7053.48 Da using electrospray ionization (ESI) MS (Fig. 1C, inset). The amino acid sequence of this peptide was determined by N-terminal Edman degradation, cDNA cloning, and Edman degradation of enzyme (Glu-C)-digested fragments (Fig. 1D and Fig. S1). The peptide is composed of 62 amino acid residues with eight cysteine residues. This peptide belongs to the family of three-finger peptide toxins and shares high sequence identity with cardiotoxin A5, cardiotoxin-like basic polypeptides (CLBPs), and some other cardiotoxins (CTXs) (20Takechi M. Tanaka Y. Hayashi K. Amino acid sequence of a cardiotoxin-like basic polypeptide (CLBP) with low cytotoxic activity isolated from the venom of the Formosan cobra (Naja naja atra).Biochem.

These three-finger toxins are all β-sheet basic polypeptides that contain 60–62 amino acid residues with a three-fingered loop-folding topology. This peptide could also adopt the three-finger structure, as revealed by structure simulation based on the CTX A5 structure (Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 1KXI) as a template using SWISS-MODEL (http://swissmodel.expasy.org) (Fig. 1E) (22Biasini M. Bienert S. Waterhouse A. Arnold K. Studer G. Schmidt T. Kiefer F. Gallo Cassarino T. Bertoni M. Bordoli L. Schwede T. SWISS-MODEL: modelling protein tertiary and quaternary structure using evolutionary information.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 (24782522): W252-W25810.1093/nar/gku340Crossref PubMed Scopus (3627) Google Scholar). According to the peptide toxin nomenclature proposed by King et al. (23King G.F. Gentz M.C. Escoubas P. Nicholson G.M. A rational nomenclature for naming peptide toxins from spiders and other venomous animals.Toxicon. 2008; 52 (18619481): 264-27610.1016/j.toxicon.2008.05.020Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), we named this peptide toxin μ-EPTX-Na1a (referred to as Na1a herein). The peptide identified in this study had no cytotoxicity, as revealed by the assays mentioned below. Notably, we discovered that Na1a is a potent inhibitor of Nav1.8. Because Nav1.8 is primarily expressed in small-diameter DRG neurons, we first evaluated the ability and selectivity of Na1a to block Nav1.8 currents in rat DRG neurons. Generally, large neurons (>45 μm) mainly express TTX-S Na+ currents mediated by the Nav1.1, Nav1.6, and Nav1.7 subtypes, whereas small nociceptive neurons (<20 μm) contain both TTX-S and TTX-R Na+ currents mediated by Nav1.8 and Nav1.9 (24Catterall W.A. Perez-Reyes E. Snutch T.P. Striessnig J. International Union of Pharmacology. XLVIII. Nomenclature and structure-function relationships of voltage-gated calcium channels.Pharmacol. Rev. 2005; 57 (16382099): 411-42510.1124/pr.57.4.5Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). TTX (1 μm) was added to the bathing solution to separate TTX-S Na+ currents from TTX-R Na+ currents. Additionally, to record Nav1.8 currents in small-diameter DRG neurons, the holding potential was clamped at −70 mV to inactivate the TTX-R Nav1.9 channel (25Han C. Estacion M. Huang J. Vasylyev D. Zhao P. Dib-Hajj S.D. Waxman S.G. Human Nav1.8: enhanced persistent and ramp currents contribute to distinct firing properties of human DRG neurons.J. Neurophysiol. 2015; 113 (25787950): 3172-318510.1152/jn.00113.2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, 1 μm Na1a potently blocked the slow inactivated TTX-R Nav1.8 current in small-diameter DRG neurons (Fig. 2A), whereas 10 μm Na1a exhibited a negligible inhibition of TTX-S Na+ currents in large-diameter DRG neurons (Fig. 2B). In addition, the peptide did not alter the persistent Nav1.9 currents in small-diameter neurons evoked by depolarization to −60 mV from the holding potential of −100 mV (Fig. 2C) (26Maingret F. Coste B. Padilla F. Clerc N. Crest M. Korogod S.M. Delmas P. Inflammatory mediators increase Nav1.9 current and excitability in nociceptors through a coincident detection mechanism.J. Gen. Physiol. 2008; 131 (18270172): 211-22510.1085/jgp.200709935Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Notably, only Nav1.9 currents were activated by this type of depolarization in rat DRG neurons. These data indicated that Nav1.8 was the specific target of Na1a in rat DRG neurons. The inhibition by Na1a of the Nav1.8 current was dose-dependent, and the IC50 was calculated as 141 nm (Fig. 2D). The time course for Na1a-mediated inhibition was rapid (τon = 16.9 ± 0.5 s in the presence of 1 μm Na1a), and relatively slow recovery (τoff = 69.4 ± 0.9 s) by washing was observed (Fig. 2E). With treatment with 200 nm Na1a, the current–membrane voltage relationship for the Nav1.8 was positively shifted by ∼10 mV (Fig. 2F), and consequently, the steady-state activation was shifted by ∼8 mV (Fig. 2G); in addition, an approximately −11 mV shift in steady-state inactivation was observed (Fig. 2H). Herein, Na1a was found to be a gating modifier toxin targeting Nav1.8. We next evaluated whether Na1a was selective for individual VGSC subtypes expressed in HEK-293 or ND7/23 cells. As shown in Fig. 3, 1 μm Na1a potently blocked hNav1.8 current expressed in ND7/23 cells (Fig. 3H), whereas 10 μm toxin hardly affected the currents of hNav1.2, hNav1.3, hNav1.6, and hNav1.7 (Fig. 3) and only partially decreased the peak currents of hNav1.4 (Fig. 3D) and hNav1.5 (Fig. 3E). The apparent IC50 values for Nav1.8 and hNav1.5 were ∼0.38 and 8.51 μm, respectively, whereas for hNav1.4, the value might be greater than 10 μm because this concentration of toxin reduced the hNav1.4 current by only ∼40% (Fig. 3I). For the subtype Nav1.1, which was not examined in HEK-293 cells, we further tested the sensitivity to Na1a in rat hippocampal neurons, which express the Nav1.1–1.2 and Nav1.6 subtypes at high levels (27Mechaly I. Scamps F. Chabbert C. Sans A. Valmier J. Molecular diversity of voltage-gated sodium channel alpha subunits expressed in neuronal and non-neuronal excitable cells.Neuroscience. 2005; 130 (15664695): 389-39610.1016/j.neuroscience.2004.09.034Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We observed that 10 μm Na1a exhibited very weak inhibition of these composite currents (Fig. 3A). Therefore, these data established Na1a as a potent inhibitor of Nav1.8 with more than 22-fold selectivity for Nav1.8 against other VGSC subtypes. To the best of our knowledge, Na1a is the most selective peptide inhibitor of Nav1.8 identified to date. To determine whether Na1a has effects on other pain-related targets, we then evaluated the activity of Na1a on TRPV1, TRPV2, TRPV3, TRPV4, TRPA1, TRPM8, and TRPC3–6. No obvious effect of 10 μm Na1a on these pain targets was observed (Table S1). We then determined the influence of Na1a on the steady-state activation and inactivation of individual VGSCs subtypes. As shown in Fig. 4, Na1a had no apparent modulatory effects on the steady-state activation and inactivation of Nav1.2–1.7 or on the Na+ current in rat hippocampal neurons. Similarly, Na1a caused a depolarizing shift of the half-maximal activation of steady-state activation of hNav1.8 and a hyperpolarizing shift of half-maximal inactivation of steady-state inactivation by ∼−9 mV. The analgesic effect of Na1a was determined in rodent pain models. First, the ability of Na1a to attenuate acute inflammatory pain was examined. Na1a was intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected to attenuate acute inflammatory pain in mice, and the effects were examined. For the abdominal constriction test, acetic acid was i.p. injected into mice to generate an abdominal constriction response consisting of a wave of constriction and elongation passing caudally along the abdominal wall. Na1a (i.p. injected) decreased the number of writhing movements by 19.9 ± 0.5 (n = 10, p < 0.05), 58.3 ± 1.3 (n = 10, p < 0.01), and 89.6 ± 2.2% (n = 10, p < 0.01) at doses of 1, 7, and 70 nmol/kg, respectively. Similarly, i.p. injected morphine reduced the writhing by 9.1 ± 0.7 (n = 10), 44.6 ± 1.6 (n = 10, p < 0.01), and 81.7 ± 1.2% (n = 10, p < 0.01) at equivalent doses. Na1a caused significantly greater reduction than morphine when the doses were 7 and 70 nmol/kg (n = 10, p < 0.01) (Fig. 5A). Intraplantar injection of formalin caused a biphasic pain response in mice: an early nociceptive response (phase I, 0–5 min) followed by a quiescent period that precedes a second phase of nociceptive behavior (phase II, 15–30 min) (28McNamara C.R. Mandel-Brehm J. Bautista D.M. Siemens J. Deranian K.L. Zhao M. Hayward N.J. Chong J.A. Julius D. Moran M.M. Fanger C.M. TRPA1 mediates formalin-induced pain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Pretreatment with Na1a significantly reduced both the phase I and phase II responses (Fig. 5B). Compared with the control, Na1a was effective at attenuating paw licking time by 9.7 ± 0.8 (n = 12), 25.6 ± 2.3 (n = 12, p < 0.05), and 40.3 ± 1.8% (n = 12, p < 0.01) during phase I (Fig. 5C) and 8.9 ± 0.4 (n = 12), 27.4 ± 1.6 (n = 12, p < 0.05), and 67.7 ± 2.3% (n = 12, p < 0.01) during phase II (Fig. 5D) at concentrations of 1, 7, and 70 nmol/kg, respectively. As a control, pretreatment with morphine also decreased paw licking time at equivalent doses. In general, Na1a appeared to be more effective than morphine in the two phases. The difference was especially significant at a dose of 70 nmol/kg (n = 12, p < 0.01). We further determined the ability of i.p. injected Na1a to abolish inflammatory and neuropathic chronic pain in rats. The complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced rat pain model was used to evaluate the antinociceptive effect of Na1a on chronic inflammatory pain. Two days after CFA injection into the plantar area, inflammatory hyperalgesia developed on the injured hind paw, as revealed by the mechanical paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) in response to von Frey hair stimulation. The PWT values were 1.3 ± 0.5 g for the CFA injection group and 15.6 ± 1.3 g for the sham group (n = 11, p < 0.01). After Na1a was i.p. injected (1, 7, or 70 nmol/kg), the mechanical allodynia induced by CFA was reduced. As shown in Fig. 6A, at a dose of 70 nmol/kg, Na1a significantly increased the PWT at 60 min postinjection to 9.2 ± 1.1 g (n = 11, p < 0.05). The effect of Na1a was long-lasting. Even at 300 min postinjection, the PWT remained 5.8 ± 0.6 g (n = 11). Treatment with morphine at a dose of 70 nmol/kg also increased the PWTs within the recording time. Under the same conditions, Na1a had no effect on the PWT of the contralateral noninflamed paw, which was indicative of a specific antihyperanalgesic effect in this model. The antinociceptive effect of Na1a on chronic neuropathic pain was assessed by a rat model of partial nerve ligation (PNL)-induced allodynia. Two weeks after surgery, significant mechanical allodynia developed on the injured hind paw, and the PWT was 1.6 ± 0.4 g, whereas that of the sham group was 16.8 ± 1.5 g (n = 10, p < 0.01). Similar to that in the CFA model, i.p. injected Na1a or morphine at a dose of 70 nmol/kg alleviated the mechanical allodynia induced by PNL (Fig. 6B). The PWT values were 10.3 ± 0.8 g (n = 10, p < 0.05) for Na1a and 7.8 ± 0.8 g (n = 10, p < 0.05) for morphine at 60 min postinjection. The effects were maintained for a long duration, although no significant difference was observed beyond 60 min. In both the CFA and PNL models, Na1a was more effective than morphine. At 60 min postinjection, the augmentation of PWT by Na1a was significantly higher than that by morphine at the same dose of 70 nmol/kg. Our data indicate that Na1a had an antinociceptive effect on rodent pain models. Next, the potential toxicity of Na1a was evaluated by the following assays. Na1a did not cause death, and there were no evident changes in the motor functions of the mice, as revealed by the forced swimming test (Fig. 7A) at a dose of 2.1 μmol/kg (30-fold higher than the highest dose used in the antinociceptive test). Na1a did not significantly affect cell viability (HEK-293, CHO, Mat-Ly-Lu, and HeLa) at a concentration of 56 μm (Fig. 7B) and showed no detectable effect on endothelial cell (human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and calf pulmonary artery endothelial (C-PAE) cells) proliferation at a concentration of 10 μm (Fig. 7, F and G), as determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. In addition, the hemolytic activity test showed no evidence of lytic effects on rat red blood cells upon treatment with 36 μm Na1a (Fig. 7C). Moreover, the effect of Na1a on the cardiac safety–related hERG K+ channel was examined. 10 μm Na1a could inhibit only ∼13.4% of the hERG currents expressed in HEK-293 cells, whereas 1 μm toxin had no inhibitory effect; as a control, the antipsychotic drug haloperidol completely blocked the current at a concentration of 1 μm (Fig. 7, D and E). Taken together with the low inhibition of Nav1.5 by the toxin, the results indicate the low toxicity of Na1a. Recently, Nav1.8 was proven to be a crucial target for pain management, and therefore, identification of Nav1.8-selective inhibitors is urgently needed. Based on natural evolution and structural diversity, animal venom peptides afford elaborate templates and leads for the development of selective inhibitors targeting Nav1.8. A large-scale screening was performed for the identification of a Nav1.8-selective inhibitor from tens of animal venoms. The novel three-finger peptide Na1a was finally identified. The Nav1.8 inhibition activity was first evaluated in rat DRG neurons. After the TTX-R Nav1.9 channel was inactivated by a voltage clamp at a holding potential of −70 mV, Na1a robustly inhibited the TTX-R Nav1.8 current in small-diameter DRG neurons. Na1a had no detectable effect on either TTX-S current in large DRG neurons or the persistent Nav1.9 current in small-diameter DRG neurons. Among the different VGSC subtypes, Na1a possesses almost 22-fold selectivity for Nav1.8 over other subtypes. Some selective inhibitors have been discovered via a great deal of effort by different groups, including the small compound A-803467, its analog PF-01247324, and the μO-conotoxin MrVIB (11Han Z.

The selectivity of Na1a is comparable with that of A-803467 (blocked Nav1.5 at 0.3 μm) and MrVIB (10-fold selectivity). Although data for Nav1.3 are lacking, the compound PF-01247324 exhibited higher selectivity than Na1a. Therefore, Na1a is a peptide-derived Nav1.8 inhibitor with high selectivity for VGSC subtypes. Moreover, evaluation of the effect of Na1a on other pain targets showed that Na1a has comparable selectivity for other targets. Characterization of the properties of Na1a modification of Nav1.8 in DRG neurons indicates that Na1a is a gating modifier toxin with properties distinct from other VGSC gating modifiers.

https://openalex.org/W2915706650,"Class V myosins are actin-dependent motors, which recognize numerous cellular cargos mainly via the C-terminal globular tail domain (GTD). Myo2, a yeast class V myosin, can transport a broad range of organelles. However, little is known about the capacity of Myo2-GTD to recognize such a diverse array of cargos specifically at the molecular level. Here, we solved crystal structures of Myo2-GTD (at 1.9-3.1 Å resolutions) in complex with three cargo adaptor proteins: Smy1 (for polarization of secretory vesicles), Inp2 (for peroxisome transport), and Mmr1 (for mitochondria transport). The structures of Smy1- and Inp2-bound Myo2-GTD, along with site-directed mutagenesis experiments, revealed a binding site in subdomain-I having a hydrophobic groove with high flexibility enabling Myo2-GTD to accommodate different protein sequences. The Myo2-GTD-Mmr1 complex structure confirmed and complemented a previously identified mitochondrion/vacuole-specific binding region. Moreover, differences between the conformations and locations of cargo-binding sites identified here for Myo2 and those reported for mammalian MyoVA (MyoVA) suggest that class V myosins potentially have co-evolved with their specific cargos. Our structural and biochemical analysis not only uncovers a molecular mechanism that explains the diverse cargo recognition by Myo2-GTD, but also provides structural information useful for future functional studies of class V myosins in cargo transport."

https://openalex.org/W2916494034,"Background Obesity is an increasing problem worldwide and is associated with serious health risks. Obesity not only reduces physical health, but can also negatively affect levels of perceived stress, mood symptoms, sleep quality and quality of life (QoL), which may lead to further weight gain. We have previously shown that a pre-conception lifestyle intervention reduced weight and improved physical QoL in the short term. In the current study, we assessed the effects of this intervention in women with obesity and infertility on perceived stress, mood symptoms, sleep quality and QoL five years after randomization. Methods and findings We followed women who participated in the LIFEstyle study. This is a multi-center randomized controlled trial comparing a six-month lifestyle intervention to improve diet and increase physical activity followed by infertility treatment, versus prompt infertility treatment. Participants were 577 women with infertility between 18 and 39 years of age with a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 29 kg/m2. For the current study we measured perceived stress, mood symptoms, sleep quality and QoL in 178 women five years after randomization. T-tests and linear regression models were used to assess differences between the intervention and control groups. Five years after randomization, no differences were observed for perceived stress, mood symptoms, sleep quality and QoL between the intervention (n = 84) and control groups (n = 94). There was selective participation: women who did not participate in the follow-up had lower baseline mental QoL, and benefitted more from the intervention in terms of improved physical QoL during the original LIFEstyle intervention. Conclusions We found no evidence that a pre-conception lifestyle intervention improved female well-being five years after randomization."

Cumambrin A is a natural compound isolated from Chrysanthemum indicum L. and belongs to a member of the sesquiterpene lactone family. To date, the therapeutic effect of cumambrin A on osteoporosis and its mechanisms of action are not known. In this study, we found that cumambrin A can significantly inhibit osteoclast formation and bone resorption through the suppression of receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL)–induced NF-κB and nuclear factor of activated T-cell activity and ERK phosphorylation. Furthermore, cumambrin A inhibits the expression of osteoclast marker genes including cathepsin K, calcitonin receptor, and V-ATPase d2. Using an in vivo ovariectomized mouse model, we showed that cumambrin A protects against estrogen withdrawal–induced bone loss. Collectively, our results reveal that cumambrin A can suppress osteoclast formation, bone resorption, and RANKL-induced signaling pathways, suggesting that cumambrin A is a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of osteoporosis.—Zhou, L., Liu, Q., Hong, G., Song, F., Zhao, J., Yuan, J., Xu, J., Tan, R.

https://openalex.org/W2916354185,"The 'Primary HIV Prevention among Pregnant and Lactating Ugandan Women' (PRIMAL) study aimed to assess the effectiveness of an enhanced HIV counseling intervention for preventing HIV acquisition among HIV-uninfected mothers during pregnancy and throughout the breastfeeding period.We conducted an unblinded randomized control trial between 22 February 2013 and 22 April 2016 to assess the effectiveness of an extended repeat HIV testing and enhanced counseling (ERHTEC) intervention aimed at preventing primary HIV infection among HIV-uninfected pregnant and lactating women in Uganda. HIV-uninfected pregnant women aged 15-49 were enrolled 1:1 individually or in couples together with their partner. Enrolled women and couples were randomized 1:1 to an intervention (ERHTEC) or control (extended repeat HIV testing and standard counseling) group and followed up to 24 months postpartum or six weeks past complete cessation of breastfeeding, whichever came first. Both groups were tested for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV at enrollment, delivery, 3 and 6 months postpartum and every 6 months thereafter until the end of follow-up. The intervention group received enhanced HIV prevention counseling every 3 months throughout follow-up. The control group received standard counseling at the time of HIV retesting. Both intervention and control couples were offered couple HIV testing and counseling at all study visits.Frequency of condom use and incidence of HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia and trichomoniasis over follow-up.Between February 2013 and April 2014, we enrolled 820 HIV-uninfected pregnant women presenting for antenatal care individually (n = 410) or in couples (n = 410 women and 410 partners) in one urban and one rural public Ugandan hospital. Women's median age was 24 years (IQR 20-28 years). At baseline, participants did not differ in any socio-demographic, reproductive health, HIV testing history, sexual behavior, medical history or STI status characteristics; 96% (386/402) of couples were tested and counseled for HIV together with their partners at enrolment, 2.1% (7/329) of whom were found to be HIV-infected. Six hundred twenty-five (76%) women completed follow-up as per protocol (S1 Protocol). Women were followed for an average of 1.76 years and cumulated 1,439 women-years of follow-up or 81% of the maximum 1,779 women-years of follow-up assuming no dropouts. Men were followed for an average of 1.72 years. The frequency of consistent condom use and the proportion of women who used condoms over the last 3 months or at last vaginal sex increased substantially over follow-up in both arms, but there were no statistically significant differences in increases between the intervention and control arms. During follow-up, on average 42% (range 36%-46%) of couple partners were counseled together. Between 3.8% and 7.6% of women tested positive at any follow-up visit for any STI including syphilis, gonorrhea, C. trachomatis or T. vaginalis. Four women (two in each arm) and no enrolled men became infected with HIV, representing an overall HIV incidence rate of 0.186 per 100 person-years. Three of the women seroconverters had enrolled individually, one as a couple. At or before seroconversion, all four women reported their partners had extramarital relationships and/or had not disclosed their suspected HIV-infected status. There were no statistically significant differences between study arms for STI or HIV incidences.A sustained enhanced HIV prevention counseling intervention for up to 2 years postpartum among pregnant and breastfeeding women did not have a statistically significant effect on condom use or HIV incidence among these women. However, in both study arms, condom use increased over follow-up while STI and HIV incidence remained very low when compared to similar cohorts in and outside Uganda, suggesting that repeat HIV testing during breastfeeding, whether with enhanced or standard counseling, may have had an unintended HIV preventive effect among pregnant and lactating women in this setting. Further research is needed to verify this hypothesis.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01882998."

Here, using genetic engineering, we coupled the disintegrin protein echistatin, which specifically binds to the platelet integrin αIIbβ3 receptor, to annexin V, which binds platelet membrane-associated phosphatidylserine (PS), to create the bifunctional antithrombotic molecule recombinant echistatin–annexin V fusion protein (r-EchAV). Lipid binding and plasma coagulation studies revealed that r-EchAV dose-dependently binds PS and delays plasma clotting time. Moreover, r-EchAV inhibited ADP-induced platelet aggregation in a dose-dependent manner and exhibited potent antiplatelet aggregation effects. r-EchAV significantly prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, suggesting that it primarily affects the in vivo coagulation pathway. Flow cytometry results indicated that r-EchAV could effectively bind to the platelet αIIbβ3 receptor, indicating that r-EchAV retains echistatin’s receptor-recognition region. In vivo experiments in mice disclosed that r-EchAV significantly prolongs bleeding time, indicating a significant anticoagulant effect in vivo resulting from the joint binding of r-EchAV to both PS and the αIIbβ3 receptor.

Platelets are irregular fragments formed by megakaryocytes and play an important role in hemostasis, thrombosis, and inflammation. When endothelial cells are damaged, platelets are activated and adhere to the collagen fibers exposed to the injured site. The factors affecting platelet adhesion include platelet membrane glycoprotein, collagen of endothelial tissue (collagen), and hemophilia factor (von Willebrand factor). Adherent platelets release ADP, thromboxane A2, 5-hydroxytryptamine, and other contents to promote platelet activation (1Vorchheimer D.A. Becker R. Platelets in atherothrombosis.Mayo Clin.

Haematol. 1967; 13 (6025241): 269-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). At this point, multiple signaling pathways are initiated and interact with each other, and the internal signal mechanism is amplified to activate the platelet surface αIIbβ3 receptor. The damaged endothelial tissue releases coagulation factor III to activate the exogenous coagulation pathway, and the local platelets produce thrombin quickly, causing more platelet aggregation, forming a softer hemostatic embolus (3Heemskerk J.W. Bevers E.M. Lindhout T. Platelet activation and blood coagulation.Thromb. Haemost. 2002; 88 (12195687): 186-19310.1055/s-0037-1613209Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Platelets play an important role in normal wound healing and are also important causes of pathological thrombotic diseases. Thrombotic diseases are characterized by high morbidity, disability, and mortality and seriously endanger human life and health. Anticoagulant and antithrombotic drugs play an important role in the prevention and treatment of thrombotic diseases. To achieve high-efficiency antithrombosis, until recently most clinical guidelines recommended both anticoagulation and dual antiplatelet therapy (triple therapy) (4Verlinden N.J. Coons J.C.

When the platelets change from a resting state to an activated state, the PS molecules originally located in the inner membrane of the cells are largely translocated to the outside of the cell membrane. The flipping of the PS will initiate or directly participate in physiological processes such as coagulation or phagocytosis.

ANV exerts antithrombotic activity by binding to PS, inhibiting the activation of serine proteases important in blood coagulation.

Med. 1990; 115 (2137157): 174-181PubMed Google Scholar) because it rapidly passes from the blood into the kidneys due to its relatively small size. How to couple different mechanisms to achieve a multieffect therapy is an important direction of antithrombotics or anticoagulant research and development. Therefore, rational coupling of different mechanisms of action to design fusion proteins has become the key to successful research. We constructed the ECH-linker–ANV recombinant fusion protein (r-EchAV) by genetic engineering technology. ECH can efficiently bind to the integrin receptor αIIbβ3 exposed on the surface of activated platelets, inhibiting platelet aggregation efficiently to achieve an antithrombotic effect; ANV binds a large number of PS molecules valgus to the surface of activated platelets in a calcium-dependent manner. We hope that the constructed r-EchAV can simultaneously couple the above two anticoagulant/antithrombotic mechanisms to become a bifunctional antithrombotic recombinant protein molecule. This paper describes the phospholipid binding and platelet integrin receptor binding characteristics of r-EchAV, and its anticoagulant effect in vivo was evaluated based on animal models. The preparation process and physicochemical characteristics of r-EchAV were also studied and elaborated. The DNA fragments containing the constructed ECH gene and the rh-ANV gene were further amplified and subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis, and the detection results are shown in Fig. 1A. These results showed that the DNA size met the expected requirements. Combined with the results of DNA sequencing, it can be confirmed that the base sequence of the DNA fragment of the ECH gene or the ANV gene is completely correct. The translated amino acid sequences of these synthetic genes match the published sequence of ANV and ECH listed in the GenBankTM database. The ECH-L and L-ANV genes were used as templates, and E3F and LAA-3 were used as primers for upstream and downstream, respectively; PCR was carried out to construct a 1226-bp DNA fragment containing the r-EchAV gene (as shown in the Fig. 1B). After DNA sequencing, the base sequence was confirmed to be completely correct and to conform to the expected base sequence requirement of the recombinant r-EchAV gene; its nucleotide sequence thereof is shown in Table 1B. The r-EchAV gene was finally cloned into the pGEX vector, and soluble expression was achieved in Escherichia coli. Furthermore, we explored and optimized the bacterial culture and important induction expression conditions of the recombinant r-EchAV fusion protein and placed a good foundation for successful follow-up preparation of the r-EchAV.Table 1Design, synthesis and identification of r-EchAV recombinant gene The optimal IPTG dosage in the induction of r-EchAV expression is shown in Fig. 2A. Our studies showed that under the conditions of different IPTG concentrations in the medium, significant amounts of expression products were induced, with a size of 70 kDa. The molecular weight of this induced expression product was in accordance with the expected theoretical value of GST–r-EchAV (70.1 kDa). However, we also found that when the final concentration of IPTG in the medium reached 100 μm, the expression level of the macromolecule fusion recombinant protein GST–r-EchAV also reached its highest value and no longer increased in response to increases in the IPTG concentration. At the same time, considering that an excessive IPTG concentration will promote the formation of inclusion bodies in E. coli and that a too high IPTG concentration can also exhibit strong toxicity against E. coli cells, we finally determined the optimal concentration of the cell inducer IPTG of r-EchAV expression to be 100 μm for subsequent large-scale bacterial culture, induction of expression, and preparation of recombinant proteins. The experimental identification results of optimal temperature control during r-EchAV–induced expression are shown in Fig. 2B. The IPTG-induced expression of recombinant E. coli was carried out under the control conditions of 37, 30, and 25 °C, respectively. Our studies have shown that under the above temperature conditions, r-EchAV expression products could be achieved efficiently and in large quantities; the target recombinant protein expression products were found in both the isolated supernatant and the bacterial inclusion bodies, and the yield of the expressed products was not significantly different. Considering that the formation of E. coli inclusion bodies is positively correlated with the temperature, reducing the temperature during induction will help to reduce the formation of bacterial inclusion bodies, so we finally controlled the temperature during the induction of r-EchAV at 25 °C and used it as the optimum temperature for the later large-scale E. coli culture and r-EchAV preparation. We also explored the optimal harvest time during the induction of r-EchAV expression, as shown in Fig. 2C. The results showed that the content of recombinant foreign gene expression products in the whole-cell protein of the bacteria increased gradually with the prolongation of induced expression control times at 0, 5–12, and 20 h. However, we found that when the harvest time was controlled between 11 and 12 h, the recombinant protein content reached its highest value. Further prolongation of the induced expression time decreased the content of the target protein. We speculate that because of the excessive prolongation of the induction time, a degradation tendency of the recombinant expression product is also obvious, resulting in a decrease in target protein content; another reason may be that too long of an induction time will result in decreased utilization of nutrients by E. coli cells, excessive accumulation of harmful products, and reduced ability to synthesize foreign proteins in the later stage. Based on the above results, we finally determined that the induction time of r-EchAV was controlled within 12 h. Based on the above studies, recombinant fusion proteins (GST–r-EchAV) formed by r-EchAV and GST were present in a soluble form in a large amount in the supernatant after disruption of the cells. Therefore, after the induction of expression was completed, the cells were collected by centrifugation and disrupted, and then the supernatant was collected for further purification and property studies. Most of the E. coli–expressed fusion proteins were found in the inclusion bodies. Fortunately, our expression product was present in a soluble form in E. coli. Therefore, the subsequent purification steps circumvent complex and cumbersome steps such as inclusion body extraction and protein de-renaturation. The results are shown in Fig. 2D. Our studies have shown that combined with GST column-affinity chromatography technology, GST–r-EchAV recombinant foreign protein was obtained with relatively good purification, and the preparation yield was also relatively high. The purity of the target protein GST–r-EchAV was above 92%, and the yield reached 19 mg/liter (as shown in Table 2).Table 2Approximate yield and purity of the total and target proteins after extraction and purification with affinity chromatography and r-EchAV after specific digestion and ultrafiltrationTotal proteinaThe extraction and purification start from 1 liter of bacteria cultured and induced following the method described in the text.GST–r-EchAVGSTr-EchAVbr-EchAV was prepared from GST–r-EchAV by protease digestion with scissor-protease.YieldPurityYieldPurityYieldPuritymgmg%mg%mg%275.2 ± 1336.1 ± 1.69614.7 ± 0.89919.8 ± 1.199a The extraction and purification start from 1 liter of bacteria cultured and induced following the method described in the text.b r-EchAV was prepared from GST–r-EchAV by protease digestion with scissor-protease. Open table in a new tab In the specific digestion process of the GST–r-EchAV recombinant protein, we explored different substrate/enzyme molecular molar ratios to achieve optimal protease digestion. As shown in Fig. 2E, the enzymatic cleavage effect of the PSP enzyme on GST–r-EchAV was not enhanced with the increase in the amount of protease. Conversely, we observed that when the molar ratio of the recombinant protein GST–r-EchAV to PSP enzyme was 800:1 and the enzyme digestion was 12 h, the enzymatic cleavage effect was very good. GST–r-EchAV (70 kDa) can be sufficiently cleaved to form the products r-EchAV (44 kDa) and GST (26 kDa). Therefore, in the later large-scale preparation process, the proportion of substrate/enzyme was controlled at around 800:1 (molar ratio). Using the anti-human ANV polyclonal antibody, we performed a Western blotting assay on the purified r-EchAV recombinant protein. The results are shown in Fig. 2G. Our studies have shown that r-EchAV exhibits a full ANV antibody-binding effect. This indicates that the r-EchAV recombinant fusion protein retains the intact ANV epitope structure. The experimental results of molecular sieve SEC-HPLC of r-EchAV are shown in Fig. 2H. Our studies have shown that the absorption peak of the r-EchAV protein was detected in the range of 8.150–9.093-min retention time and reached its peak at 8.513 min. The peak shape symmetry was good. This result is consistent with the peak time parameter of the molecular mass of the 44-kDa protein identified by SEC-HPLC. The absorption peak-to-peak area percentage of the target protein r-EchAV reached 92.852%. This fully demonstrates that the r-EchAV recombinant protein exists in a single form; the monomer form is stably present, and no polymer is formed in a solution state. This structural feature is different from that of ANV. ANV can form dimers or even polymers. This suggests that the addition of the ECH structure to the N-terminal of the ANV molecule hinders the intermolecular polymerization of ANV and changes the original polymerization conditions of the ANV molecule. The r-EchAV molecule is preferably present in solution in a stable form as a single molecule. The test results are shown in Fig. 3A. Our studies have shown that r-EchAV, like ANV molecules, exhibits different binding abilities to different phospholipids, i.e. it does not bind to PC, and the binding effect with PS increases with increasing sample protein concentration, showing a significant dose-dependent relationship. This indicates that the phospholipid-binding properties of r-EchAV are not significantly different from those of ANV. This also suggests that the ECH structure in the r-EchAV molecule does not block the interaction site of ANV with PS. The results are shown in Fig. 3B. As seen from this figure, when different doses of PS were immobilized in the wells of the ELISA plate, the binding of r-EchAV to PS showed a dose-dependent relationship, and at PS >2.5 μg, the protein and PS were gradually saturated. The results are shown in Fig. 3C. Our studies have shown that the binding activity of r-EchAV to PS increases with an increase in Ca2+ concentration when the Ca2+ concentration is between 0.5 and 10 mm. This finding indicates that the specific binding between the r-EchAV molecule and PS requires the presence of Ca2+. This characteristic is similar in nature to ANV. As a calcium ion-dependent phospholipid-binding protein, ANV can reversibly bind to negatively charged PS when Ca2+ is present. To determine the binding parameters of the interaction between r-EchAV and PS or PC, we performed surface plasmon resonance assays. The preparations of r-EchAV or ANV were allowed to flow over the chip in the presence of 2 mm Ca2+. Preliminary measurements show that r-EchAV and ANV have very similar phospholipid binding characteristics. The binding range between the two proteins and PS is approximately Kd = 1.83–2.15 nm, as shown in Fig. 3, D–F. At the same time, the binding of the two proteins to PC is much weaker than that of PS, and it is generally considered that there is no specific binding. Under the same conditions, BSA did not bind to PS or PC (data not shown). Based on the above findings (Fig. 3), it was shown that the activity of the ANV structure in the r-EchAV molecule was completely retained. The activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) assays are useful in in vitro global tests for assessing the activities of the classical extrinsic, intrinsic, and common pathways of coagulation and for monitoring anticoagulant therapy. At the same concentration, the aPTT value prolonged by the r-EchAV group was slightly higher than that of the ANV group; r-EchAV was about 1.5-fold more potent than ANV, and both were significantly higher than the normal reference range (as shown in Fig. 4A). In terms of the effects on PT (plasma clotting time) value, FIB (fibrinogen) value, and TT (thrombin time) value, neither of them caused statistically significant changes; and they were all within the normal clinical reference range. Furthermore, r-EchAV showed a dose-dependent effect on aPTT value (as shown in Fig. 4B). With the increase in the r-EchAV concentration, the aPTT value was significantly prolonged; and when the r-EchAV concentration was greater than 5 μmol/liter, the amplitude of aPTT changed more than the maximum within the normal reference range. However, when the concentration of r-EchAV increased, the PT value, FIB value, and TT value did not change much, and there was basically no statistically significant change. The aPTT measures the intrinsic pathway activity, such as coagulation factors XII, XI, IX, and X, and the reduction in these coagulation factors will cause prolongation of the aPTT value. Based on the above analysis results, we speculate that r-EchAV cannot fully activate factor X by binding to Ca2+ and phospholipid molecules, thereby affecting the endogenous coagulation pathway and thus affecting the common coagulation pathway. The results are shown in Fig. 5; the turbidity dynamics of different plasma samples were measured using a microplate reader. PS alone only weakly promotes plasma coagulation (Fig. 5A). This may be because PS binds to coagulant factors Xa and Va, which are involved in steps that are rather late in the coagulation cascade. As shown in Fig. 5B, when r-EchAV was added to plasma in a PS-coated well, the onset of coagulation was delayed; a concentration of 20 μm r-EchAV delayed the onset time of coagulation from 30 to 50 min. As the concentration of r-EchAV increased, the plasma clotting time was significantly prolonged. The delay effects of coagulation by r-EchAV were dose-dependent, but the effect was barely presented in a PC-coated well as compared with a PS-coated"
https://openalex.org/W2916706624,"Patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB) are known to have a good clinical response to cardiac resynchronization therapy. However, the high number of false positive diagnosis obtained with the conventional LBBB criteria limits the effectiveness of this therapy, which has yielded to the definition of new stricter criteria. They require prolonged QRS duration, a QS or rS pattern in the QRS complexes at leads V1 and V2 and the presence of mid-QRS notch/slurs in 2 leads within V1, V2, V5, V6, I and aVL. The aim of this work was to develop and assess a fully-automatic algorithm for strict LBBB diagnosis based on the wavelet transform. Twelve-lead, high-resolution, 10-second ECGs from 602 patients enrolled in the MADIT-CRT trial were available. Data were labelled for strict LBBB by 2 independent experts and divided into training (n = 300) and validation sets (n = 302) for assessing algorithm performance. After QRS detection, a wavelet-based delineator was used to detect individual QRS waves (Q, R, S), QRS onsets and ends, and to identify the morphological QRS pattern on each standard lead. Then, multilead QRS boundaries were defined in order to compute the global QRS duration. Finally, an automatic algorithm for notch/slur detection within the QRS complex was applied based on the same wavelet approach used for delineation. In the validation set, LBBB was diagnosed with a sensitivity and specificity of Se = 92.9% and Sp = 65.1% (Acc = 79.5%, PPV = 74% and NPV = 89.6%). The results confirmed that diagnosis of strict LBBB can be done based on a fully automatic extraction of temporal and morphological QRS features. However, it became evident that consensus in the definition of QRS duration as well as notch and slurs definitions is necessary in order to guarantee accurate and repeatable diagnosis of complete LBBB."
https://openalex.org/W2917301708,"Recently, the clinical outcome of prostate cancer treated by hypofractionated radiation therapy has been reported. However, there are few reports from Japan. In Hidaka Hospital, hypofractionated intensity-modulated radiotherapy (HIMRT) for prostate cancer was initiated in 2007. The purpose of this study is to analyze the long-term outcome.Ninety-two patients with localized prostate cancer treated with HIMRT at Hidaka Hospital between 2007 and 2009 were retrospectively analyzed. HIMRT was delivered using TomoTherapy. The prescription dose was 66 Gy at 95% of the PTV in 22 fractions performed 3 days a week over 7 weeks in all patients. The overall survival rate, biochemical relapse-free rate, and acute and late toxicities were evaluated.The median follow-up duration was 78 (range 14-100) months. The median age at the start of the HIMRT was 72 (range 46-84) years. The disease characteristics were as follows: stage T1c, 45; T2a, 20; T2b, 5; T2c, 1; T3a, 13; T3b, 6; T4, 2; Gleason score 6, 13; 7, 44; 8, 20; 9, 15; 10, 0; pretreatment PSA ≤10 ng/mL, 42; 10 to ≤20, 27; and >20, 23. According to the D'Amico classification system, 10, 37, and 45 patients were classified as low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk. The overall survival rate, the cause-specific survival rate, and the biochemical relapse-free rate at 5 years was 94.7%, 100% and 98.9%, respectively. Severe acute toxicity (grade 3 or more) was not observed. The late urinary toxicity was 52.2% in grade 0, 28.3% in grade 1, 19.6% in grade 2, and 2.2% in grade 3. The late rectal toxicity was 78.3% in grade 0, 7.6% in grade 1, 9.8% in grade 2, and 4.3% in grade 3.The present study demonstrated that HIMRT using TomoTherapy for prostate cancer has a favorable outcome with tolerable toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2916610642,"Skin resident T cells provide immediate immunologic responses at their specific location and play a role in the pathogenesis of skin diseases such as psoriasis. Recently, IL-9-producing T cells were described as a major T-cell subtype present in the skin, but knowledge on the biology and in situ regulation of this T-cell subtype is scarce. Here, we investigated the cytokine influence on skin T cells with focus on IL-9–producing T cells because a better understanding of their biology may identify novel therapeutic approaches. Healthy human skin biopsies were cultured either in the presence of IL-2, IL-4, and TGF-β [T helper (Th)9–promoting condition (Th9-PC)] or IL-2 and IL-15 [standard condition (SC)]. Paired analysis of enzymatically isolated skin T cells and emigrated T cells after 4 wk of skin culture showed significant alterations of T-cell phenotypes, cytokine production, and IL-9-producing T-cell frequency. RNA sequencing analysis revealed differentially regulated pathways and identified CXCL8 and CXCL13 as top up-regulated genes in Th9-PC compared with SC. Functionally supernatant of stimulated skin-derived T cells, CXCL8 and CXCL13 increased neutrophil survival. We report that the cytokine environment alters skin-derived T-cell phenotype and functional properties.—Kienzl, P., Polacek, R., Reithofer, M., Reitermaier, R., Hagenbach, P., Tajpara, P., Vierhapper, M., Gschwandtner, M., Mildner, M.

https://openalex.org/W2917337396,"A type 1 immune response is involved in atherosclerosis progression, whereas the role of a type 2 polarization, especially with regard to an enhanced T helper (Th)2 cell differentiation, is still unclear. Helminths trigger type 2 immune responses, protecting the host from inflammatory disorders. We investigated whether an increased type 2 polarization by administration of Litomosoides sigmodontis adult worm extract (LsAg) affects atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE-/-) mice. Injections of 50 µg LsAg, i.p. into ApoE-/- mice induced a type 2 immune response shown by increased frequencies of peritoneal eosinophils and alternatively activated macrophages. To analyze the effect of LsAg on atherosclerosis initiation, ApoE-/- mice received a high-fat diet for 12 wk and weekly injections of 50 µg LsAg from wk 5 to 12. Therapeutic effects on advanced atherosclerosis were analyzed in mice that were fed a high-fat diet for 12 wk followed by 12 wk of normal chow and weekly LsAg injections. Both preventive and therapeutic LsAg application significantly decreased plaque size. Therapeutic treatment even caused regression of plaque size and macrophage density in the aortic root and reduced Th1-specific gene expression and intraplaque inflammation. In addition, plaque size after therapeutic treatment was inversely correlated with plaque-infiltrated alternatively activated macrophages. In vitro, LsAg treatment of HUVECs reduced intracellular levels of phosphorylated NF-κB-p65, IκB-α, and JNK1/2. In bifurcation flow-through slides, THP-1 cell adhesion to a HUVEC monolayer was decreased by LsAg in regions of nonuniform shear stress. Applying inhibitors of the respective kinases suggests JNK1/2 inhibition is involved in the suppressed cell adhesion. A switch to an enhanced type 2 immune response by LsAg exerts antiatherogenic effects on murine plaque development, indicating a protective role of a hampered type 1 polarization. In vitro, LsAg affects endothelial signaling pathways, among which JNK1/2 inhibition seems to be involved in the suppression of monocytic cell adhesion under proatherogenic shear stress.-Constanze, K., Tauchi, M., Furtmair, R., Urschel, K., Raaz-Schrauder, D., Neumann, A.-L., Frohberger, S.

https://openalex.org/W2917196590,"This paper describes a new implementation for calculating Jacobian and its time derivative for robot manipulators in real-time. The estimation of Jacobian is the key in the real-time implementation of kinematics and dynamics of complex planar or spatial robots with fixed as well as floating axes in which the Jacobian form changes with the structure. The proposed method is suitable for such implementations. The new method is based on matrix differential calculus. Unlike the conventional methods, which are based on screw theory, the Jacobian calculation in the proposed approach has been reduced to the inner product of two matrices. Use of the new method to derive linear and angular velocity parts of Jacobian and its time derivative is described in detail. We have demonstrated the method using a two-DOF spatial robot and a hyper-redundant spatial robot."
https://openalex.org/W2915484319,"Background Velopharyngeal structure augmentation methods are used as alternatives to velopharyngeal plasty. Anatomic sites of implantation/injection vary widely due to a lack of standardized criteria. Here, we experimentally investigated optimal sites of velopharyngeal structure augmentation via saline injection in dogs as they naturally exhibit velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI). Methods Velopharyngeal structure augmentation was performed on 10 beagles (age range: 20–24 months; weight range: 9–12 kg). Saline containing 1/80,000 epinephrine was injected intraorally in 1-mL increments into the nasal mucosa of the soft palate (n = 4), posterior pharyngeal wall (n = 3), or bilateral pharyngeal walls (n = 3) of each dog. Nasal air leakage was measured under rebreathing until velopharyngeal closure was achieved; the measurement was performed using flow meter sensors on both nasal apertures, and the oral cavity was filled with alginate impression material to prevent oral air leakage. Results Pre-injection, the dogs exhibited an average of 0.455 L/s air leakage from the nasal cavity. The dogs with saline injected into the nasal mucosa of the soft palate achieved steady augmentation, and nasal air leakage disappeared under rebreathing following 6-mL saline injection. Conversely, nasal air leakage remained in the dogs with saline injected in the posterior pharyngeal wall or bilateral pharyngeal walls. Conclusions During VPI treatment in dogs, augmentation was most effective at the nasal mucosa of the soft palate. Improvement in nasal air leakage was highly dependent on the saline injection volume. Although velopharyngeal structures vary between dogs and humans, velopharyngeal closure style is similar. Thus, our results may aid in the treatment of VPI patients."
https://openalex.org/W2917916254,"Most recently, Kan Yang et al. proposed an attribute-keyword based encryption scheme for data publish-subscribe service(AKPS), which is highly useful for cloud storage scenario. Unfortunately, we discover that there is a flaw in the security proof of indistinguishability of the tag and trapdoor against chosen keyword attack under the Bilinear Diffie-Hellman (BDH) assumption. As the security proof is a key component for a cryptographic scheme, based on the Decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH) assumption, we improve the security proof method and give a new security proof of the AKPS scheme for indistinguishability of the tag and trapdoor in our proposal, which is more rigorous than the original one. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that the AKPS scheme is secure against data Replayable Chosen Ciphertext Attack (RCCA)."
https://openalex.org/W2915716935,"Fusion between cells of different organisms (i.e., xenogeneic hybrids) can occur, and for humans this may occur in the course of tissue transplantation, animal handling, and food production. Previous work shows that conferred advantages are rare in xenogeneic hybrids, whereas risks of cellular dysregulation are high. Here, we explore the transcriptome of individual xenogeneic hybrids of human mesenchymal stem cells and murine cardiomyocytes soon after fusion and ask whether the process is stochastic or involves conserved pathway activation. Toward this end, single-cell RNA sequencing was used to analyze the transcriptomes of hybrid cells with respect to the human and mouse genomes. Consistent with previous work, hybrids possessed a unique transcriptome distinct from either fusion partner but were dominated by the cardiomyocyte transcriptome. New in this work is the documentation that a few genes that were latent in both fusion partners were consistently expressed in hybrids. Specifically, human growth hormone 1, murine ribosomal protein S27, and murine ATP synthase H+ transporting, mitochondrial Fo complex subunit C2 were expressed in nearly all hybrids. The consistent activation of latent genes between hybrids suggests conserved signaling mechanisms that either cause or are the consequence of fusion of these 2 cell types and might serve as a target for limiting unwanted xenogeneic fusion in the future.-Yuan, C., Freeman, B. T., McArdle, T. J., Jung, J. P., Ogle, B. M. Conserved pathway activation following xenogeneic, heterotypic fusion."
