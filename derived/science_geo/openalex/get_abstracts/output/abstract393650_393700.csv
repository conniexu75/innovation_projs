https://openalex.org/W2001265759,"X-ray crystallography provides the vast majority of macromolecular structures, but the success of the method relies on growing crystals of sufficient size. In conventional measurements, the necessary increase in X-ray dose to record data from crystals that are too small leads to extensive damage before a diffraction signal can be recorded. It is particularly challenging to obtain large, well-diffracting crystals of membrane proteins, for which fewer than 300 unique structures have been determined despite their importance in all living cells. Here we present a method for structure determination where single-crystal X-ray diffraction 'snapshots' are collected from a fully hydrated stream of nanocrystals using femtosecond pulses from a hard-X-ray free-electron laser, the Linac Coherent Light Source. We prove this concept with nanocrystals of photosystem I, one of the largest membrane protein complexes. More than 3,000,000 diffraction patterns were collected in this study, and a three-dimensional data set was assembled from individual photosystem I nanocrystals (∼200 nm to 2 μm in size). We mitigate the problem of radiation damage in crystallography by using pulses briefer than the timescale of most damage processes. This offers a new approach to structure determination of macromolecules that do not yield crystals of sufficient size for studies using conventional radiation sources or are particularly sensitive to radiation damage."

Here we show that expression of PdgfR-α segregates mouse ESC-derived Flk-1 mesoderm into Flk-1+PdgfR-α+ cardiac and Flk-1+PdgfR-α− hematopoietic subpopulations. By monitoring Flk-1 and PdgfR-α expression, we found that specification of cardiac mesoderm and cardiomyocytes is determined by remarkably small changes in levels of Activin/Nodal and BMP signaling. Translation to human ESCs and iPSCs revealed that the emergence of cardiac mesoderm could also be monitored by coexpression of KDR and PDGFR-α and that this process was similarly dependent on optimal levels of Activin/Nodal and BMP signaling. Importantly, we found that individual mouse and human pluripotent stem cell lines require optimization of these signaling pathways for efficient cardiac differentiation, illustrating a principle that may well apply in other contexts.

Expression of Flk1/KDR and PDGFR-α identify PSC-derived cardiac mesoderm Cardiac specification requires stage-specific Activin/Nodal and BMP signaling Individual PSC lines require optimization for efficient cardiac differentiation The potential to generate functional cell types from ESCs and iPSCs offers unprecedented opportunities to develop novel cell-based therapies for degenerative diseases, to establish predictive drug toxicology tests, to study the earliest stages of human development, and to model human disease in culture. Among the different cell types that can be derived from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) in culture, the cardiovascular lineages are of particular interest because heart disease is the leading cause of death in the western world, congenital abnormalities of the heart are relatively common, and unexpected cardiac toxicity prevents many new drugs from reaching the market. For the above therapeutic, disease discovery, and predictive toxicology applications of PSC-derived cell types to become a reality, strategies need to be developed that promote the efficient and reproducible differentiation of both ESCs and iPSCs to the cardiac lineage (Murry and Keller, 2008Murry C.E.

Differentiation of embryonic stem cells to clinically relevant populations: lessons from embryonic development.Cell. 2008; 132: 661-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar). The most successful differentiation approaches to date are those that have recapitulated, in vitro, the regulatory pathways that control the establishment of the corresponding lineage in the early embryo. Using cues from developmental biology, significant advances have been made in our understanding of cardiac differentiation from mouse and human ESCs and findings from these studies have demonstrated that one of the earliest stages of differentiation, the induction of cardiac mesoderm, can be monitored by the temporal expression KDR (Flk-1) (Kattman et al., 2006Kattman S.J.

Although the identification of KDR/Flk-1 as a cardiac mesoderm marker did provide a means of measuring mesoderm induction and isolating mesoderm populations, relying solely on this receptor as a marker of early cardiac induction is problematic because it is expressed on different mesoderm populations (Ema et al., 2006Ema M. Takahashi S. Rossant J.

To be able to specifically monitor the onset of cardiac development, it is necessary to identify new markers that segregate populations at the mesoderm stage of development. PdgfR-α is a potential candidate marker for such studies, as shown by the fact that it is coexpressed with Flk-1 in the cardiac mesoderm at embryonic stage 7.5 (E7.5) (Kataoka et al., 1997Kataoka H. Takakura N. Nishikawa S. Tsuchida K. Kodama H. Kunisada T. Risau W. Kita T. Nishikawa S.I.

Analysis of serum-induced mESC-derived populations revealed that cardiomyocyte potential could be identified in the Flk-1+PdgfR-α+ fraction (Hirata et al., 2007Hirata H. Kawamata S. Murakami Y. Inoue K. Nagahashi A. Tosaka M. Yoshimura N. Miyamoto Y. Iwasaki H. Asahara T. Sawa Y.

Bioeng. 2007; 103: 412-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), further supporting the concept that PdgfR-α can be used as a marker of early cardiac development in PSC cultures. To promote efficient cardiovascular differentiation from PSCs, it is necessary to elucidate and control the signaling pathways that regulate the establishment of these lineages during embryonic development. Studies with different model organisms have demonstrated that the Activin/Nodal/TGF-β, Wnt, and BMP pathways all play pivotal roles in establishment of the cardiovascular system (Conlon et al., 1994Conlon F.L.

Previous reports have documented that combinations of activin A and BMP-4 will induce cardiovascular development in serum-free human ESC (hESC) cultures (Laflamme et al., 2007Laflamme M.A. Chen K.Y. Naumova A.V. Muskheli V. Fugate J.A. Dupras S.K. Reinecke H. Xu C. Hassanipour M.

Linden R.M. et al.Human cardiovascular progenitor cells develop from a KDR+ embryonic-stem-cell-derived population.Nature. 2008; 453: 524-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). However, these studies did not define a stage-specific role for these factors nor did they investigate, in detail, the influence of different levels of signaling on the differentiation program. In the present study, we evaluated the role of the Activin/Nodal and BMP4 signaling pathways on the induction of cardiac mesoderm in mouse and human PSC differentiation cultures as monitored by the coexpression of Flk-1/KDR and PdgfR-α. With mouse PSCs we show that small changes in the amount of either Activin/Nodal or BMP4 signaling dramatically changes the proportion of Flk-1+PdgfR-α+ cardiac mesoderm that develops in the EBs. Optimally induced EBs consisted of greater than 60% Flk-1+PdgfRα+ cells and generated cultures highly enriched in cardiomyocytes (>60%) without the need for cell sorting. Manipulation of these pathways in human PSC cultures resulted in a similar efficient induction of greater than 50% KDR+PDGFR-α+ populations that also generated enriched cardiomyocyte populations without cell sorting. Application of these principles to individual human iPSC (hiPSC) differentiation cultures allowed for the optimization of conditions that promote the generation of cardiac mesoderm and cardiomyocytes. The findings presented in this report highlight the importance of elucidating the optimal signaling networks and monitoring quantitatively the earliest stages of lineage commitment for achieving efficient and reproducible differentiation of PSCs. For serum-free (SF) differentiation of mouse ESCs, embryoid bodies (EBs) were generated and cultured for 2 days in SF media in the absence of any factors as previously described (Figure 1A ; Nostro et al., 2008Nostro M.C. Cheng X. Keller G.M. Gadue P. Wnt, activin, and BMP signaling regulate distinct stages in the developmental pathway from embryonic stem cells to blood.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 2: 60-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). At day 2 (stage 1), the EBs were harvested and the cells were dissociated and reaggregated in SF media in the presence of VEGF (5 ng/ml) and varying concentrations of Activin A (hereafter referred to as activin) (0–4 ng/ml) and BMP4 (0.1–12.5 ng/ml). The induced EBs were analyzed 28 hr later (day 3; D3) by flow cytometry for the presence of Flk-1 and PdgfR-α. In the absence of activin, cell yield was low, but the ESCs did differentiate to generate three distinct populations: Flk-1+PdgfR-α− (F+P−), Flk-1−PdgfR-α+ (F−P+), and Flk-1−PdgfR-α− (F−P−). Few Flk-1+PdgfR-α+ (F+P+) cells developed under these conditions (Figure 1B). Increasing the concentration of activin from 1 ng/ml to 4 ng/ml in the presence of low concentrations of BMP4 had a striking effect and resulted in the emergence of a large F+P+ population, reaching more than 60% of the entire EBs in cultures induced with 4 ng/ml activin and either 0.1 or 0.5 ng/ml of BMP4. Increasing concentrations of BMP4 inhibited the activin-induced generation of F+P+ cells and promoted the development of the F+P− population. In the absence of BMP4, few viable cells remained (data not shown). The dramatic increase in size of the F+P+ population with each doubling of the activin concentration highlights the sensitivity of the system to this signaling pathway. Addition of the Wnt inhibitor DKK1 to the cultures from days 2–3 of differentiation blocked the development of the T+ (brachyury) primitive streak population (Kouskoff et al., 2005Kouskoff V. Lacaud G. Schwantz S. Fehling H.J. Keller G. Sequential development of hematopoietic and cardiac mesoderm during embryonic stem cell differentiation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 13170-13175Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and the Flk-1+PdgfR-α+ cardiac mesoderm (Figure S1 available online), confirming previous studies demonstrating that these early differentiation steps were dependent on Wnt signaling (Gadue et al., 2006Gadue P. Huber T.L. Paddison P.J. Keller G.M. Wnt and TGF-beta signaling are required for the induction of an in vitro model of primitive streak formation using embryonic stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 9685-9690Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Addition of exogenous Wnt3a (up to 21 ng/ml) had no effect on the development of the F+P+ population (data not shown). Collectively these findings demonstrate that activin and BMP regulate the development of the F+P+ population from mESCs in a concentration dependent-manner in the presence of endogenous Wnt signaling. The F+P+ and F+P− populations induced with activin (4 ng/ml) and BMP4 (0.1 ng/ml) were isolated by cell sorting at day 3 of differentiation and the cells were plated as a monolayer in cardiac conditions (stage 2, Figure 1A; Kattman et al., 2006Kattman S.J. Huber T.L. Keller G.M. Multipotent flk-1+ cardiovascular progenitor cells give rise to the cardiomyocyte, endothelial, and vascular smooth muscle lineages.Dev. Cell. 2006; 11: 723-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). After 4 days in monolayer culture (7 days total culture), the populations were harvested and analyzed for expression of the cardiac isoform of Troponin T (cTnT) by means of intracellular flow cytometry. As shown in Figure 2A , the F+P+-derived population consisted of more than 50% cTnT+ cardiomyocytes by day 7. In contrast, the F+P− population generated few cardiomyocytes (<1%) but did give rise to a substantial population that expressed the hematopoietic marker CD41 (Ferkowicz et al., 2003Ferkowicz M.J. Starr M. Xie X. Li W. Johnson S.A. Shelley W.C. Morrison P.R. Yoder M.C.

Expression of CD41 marks the initiation of definitive hematopoiesis in the mouse embryo.Blood. 2003; 101: 508-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The F+P+ population did not generate significant number of CD41+ cells (<1%). These findings demonstrate that the F+P+ population at this stage of development contains a cardiogenic population whereas the F+P− population appears to represent mesoderm fated to the hematopoietic lineage. Although we observed the induction of a large F+P+ population in the presence of 4 ng/ml of activin in our initial studies, the routine generation of these cells was more consistent with double the amount of activin (8 ng/ml) and 0.5 ng/ml of BMP4 with this cell line. Concentrations of activin greater than 8 ng/ml did not result in any further increase in the size of this population. Under these conditions the F+P+ fraction typically represented more than 50% of the total EB population (Figure 2B). When induction levels of F+P+ were 60% or greater, it was possible to generate highly enriched cardiomyocyte populations by simply replating the unfractionated EB cells as a monolayer in cardiac conditions. As shown in Figure 2B, the frequency of cTnT+ cells (>60%) was similar in cultures generated from the isolated F+P+ cells and the unsorted population. An average yield of 4.5 cardiomyocytes per input mESC was achieved with optimized differentiation and sorting of the F+P+ population. The majority of the cTnT+ cells also expressed Sma (Figure 2C), an observation consistent with previous studies in the chick demonstrating that the earliest embryonic cardiomyocytes are Sma+ (Ruzicka and Schwartz, 1988Ruzicka D.L. Schwartz R.J. Sequential activation of alpha-actin genes during avian cardiogenesis: Vascular smooth muscle alpha-actin gene transcripts mark the onset of cardiomyocyte differentiation.J.

Onset of expression and regional deposition of alpha-smooth and sarcomeric actin during avian heart development.Dev. Dyn. 1992; 193: 116-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Most of the cTnT-negative cells also expressed Sma, indicating that they represent the smooth muscle and/or cardiac fibroblast lineage cells. Few CD31+ endothelial cells were detected, probably reflecting the fact that the cultures were not optimized for endothelial cell differentiation and growth. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the BMP4/activin-induced F+P+ population is enriched for cardiac potential. Molecular analyses of populations at different stages including uninduced (day 2) and induced (day 3) EBs, isolated F+P+ and F+P− fractions and monolayer cultures generated from the F+P+ fraction revealed patterns consistent with normal cardiac development. Expression of Mesp1, a gene expressed in cardiac mesoderm in the embryo (Saga et al., 1996Saga Y. Hata N. Kobayashi S. Magnuson T. Seldin M.F. Taketo M.M.

Miyagawa-Tomita S. Takagi A. Kitajima S. Miyazaki J.i. Inoue T. MesP1 is expressed in the heart precursor cells and required for the formation of a single heart tube.Development. 1999; 126: 3437-3447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), increased dramatically between days 2 and 3 of differentiation and segregated to the F+P+ population (Figure 2D). Within 24 hr of monolayer culture, the levels of expression dropped and remained low for the duration of the culture. Expression of Isl1, Nkx2.5, Tbx5, and mef2c was upregulated during the first 24–48 hr of monolayer culture, indicating specification and development of the cardiac lineage during this time frame. Contracting cardiomyocytes were consistently detected at day 5 of differentiation. Scl, a marker of early hematopoietic and vascular development, was expressed at highest levels in the F+P− population, consistent with its potential to generate CD41+ hematopoietic cells. With the development of contracting cardiomyocytes, we observed the upregulation of expression of Mlc2a, Mlc2v, and Nppa (data not shown). These data strongly suggest that the activin/BMP4-induced F+P+ population represents the in vitro equivalent of cardiac mesoderm that can efficiently differentiate to cardiomyocytes. To determine whether the directed differentiation approach optimized for mESCs was applicable to pluripotent stem cells in general, we tested three different miPSC lines: Oct4-GFP and Sox2-GFP derived from reprogrammed fibroblasts containing GFP targeted to the Oct4 or Sox2 locus, respectively (Stadtfeld et al., 2008Stadtfeld M. Maherali N. Breault D.T. Hochedlinger K. Defining molecular cornerstones during fibroblast to iPS cell reprogramming in mouse.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 2: 230-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar), and EOS3F-29 generated from reprogrammed fibroblasts that had been infected with the EOS lentiviral vector engineered to express GFP under control of Oct4 regulatory elements (Hotta et al., 2009Hotta A. Cheung A.Y.L. Farra N. Vijayaragavan K. Séguin C.A. Draper J.S. Pasceri P. Maksakova I.A. Mager D.L. Rossant J. et al.Isolation of human iPS cells using EOS lentiviral vectors to select for pluripotency.Nat. Methods. 2009; 6: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). As observed with the mESCs, the Oct4-GFP cell line did generate a substantial F+P+ population when induced with 2, 4, 8, and 16 ng/ml activin along with low concentrations of BMP4 (Figure 3A ). Increasing the amount of BMP4 led to an increase in the size of the F+P− populations in the presence of the different concentrations of activin tested. When replated in monolayer cultures, EB-derived cells induced with activin 8 ng/ml and BMP4 0.5 ng/ml differentiated within 4 days to give rise to a population consisting of 65% contracting cTnT+ cells (Figure 3B; Movie S1). As observed with the mESCs, Mesp1 was expressed in the F+P+ population and preceded expression of Isl1 and Nkx2.5 (Figure 3C). The other two miPSC lines, Sox2-GFP and EOS3F-29, responded well to a similar range of factor concentrations and generated F+P+ populations that represented greater than 65% of the entire culture (Figures S2A and S2B). When cells generated in optimized conditions are replated in the cardiac monolayer cultures, they gave rise to populations that contained between 36% and 54% cTnT+ cells, respectively. Taken together, these findings clearly demonstrate that F+P+ cardiac mesoderm and cardiomyoctes can be efficiently specified in SF differentiation cultures from multiple miPSC lines. We were next interested to determine whether KDR and PDGFR-α expression could be used to monitor cardiac mesoderm development from human ESCs (hESCs) after induction with activin and BMP4. For these studies, we used a modified version of our previously described protocol (Figure S3A; Yang et al., 2008Yang L. Soonpaa M.H. Adler E.D. Roepke T.K. Kattman S.J. Kennedy M. Henckaerts E. Bonham K. Abbott G.W. Linden R.M. et al.Human cardiovascular progenitor cells develop from a KDR+ embryonic-stem-cell-derived population.Nature. 2008; 453: 524-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). When induced with activin and BMP4, the hESC line HES2 generated different-sized KDR+PDGFR-α− (K+P−), KDR+PDGFR-α+ (K+P+), KDR−PDGFR-α+ (K−P+), and KDR−PDGFR-α− (K−P−) populations at day 5 of differentiation (Figure 4A ). In the presence of 1 ng/ml of BMP4, no K+P− or K+P+ cells were observed at any of the activin concentrations tested. At a 10-fold higher concentration of BMP4 (10 ng/ml), K+P− and K+P+ populations were detected under all conditions of activin induction. The absence of activin favored the development of the K+P− population, whereas intermediate concentrations of activin (3 ng and 6 ng) induced relatively large K+P+ populations. Higher amounts of activin led to a reduction in the size of the K+P+ population and promoted the development of K−P− cells, which may be indicative of the emergence of definitive endoderm. As observed in the mouse ESC differentiation cultures, increasing concentrations of BMP4 reduced the size of the K+P+ population that developed in the presence of optimal levels of activin, 3 and 6 ng/ml. Analysis of the CTNT profiles in whole EBs at day 20 revealed that cultures induced with 3 ng/ml or 6 ng/ml of activin and 10 ng/ml of BMP4 yielded the highest percentage of cardiomyocytes, indicating that the presence of K+P+ cells at day 5 is predictive of cardiac potential of the developing EBs (Figure 4B). When BMP4 was increased to 30 ng/ml, a K+P+ population was identified; however, few CTNT+ cells were generated, possibly indicating the induction of other types of mesoderm. For the hESC line HES2, the range of 3–6 ng/ml of activin with 10 ng/ml of BMP4 was found to be optimal for efficient and reproducible cardiovascular development. Similar to observations with the mouse cells, the addition of Wnt3a (up to 21 ng/ml) from days 1 to 4 had little impact on cardiac development (data not shown). EBs induced under optimal conditions upregulated expression of MESP1 between days 3 and 4 of differentiation and NKX2.5 by day 8 of differentiation (Figure 4C; Table S2). By day 20 of differentiation, these EBs typically contain between 50% and 70% CTNT+ cells and between 10% and 40% SMA+ cells, suggesting that they are comprised primarily of cardiomyocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells and/or fibroblasts (Figure 4D). To determine the cardiogenic potential of the K+P+ population, the cells were sorted and cultured as monolayers under cardiac conditions. Within 9 days of culture, the cells differentiated to generate populations highly enriched (80%) for CTNT+ cells (Figure 4E). These populations formed contracting sheets of cardiomyocytes when plated as a monolayer, as observed with the mouse cells (Movie S2). When cultured under the same monolayer conditions, the unfractionated cells generated a differentiated population that displayed the same high frequency of CTNT+ cells, indicating that the day 5 EBs, induced with optimal concentrations of BMP4 and activin, were highly enriched for cardiac mesoderm. Consistent with the generation of functional cardiomyocytes, cells in monolayer culture showed a striated pattern when stained for sarcomeric α-actinin (Figure 4F). Monolayer cells generated from day 5 sorted K+P+ cells expressed the cardiac genes NKX2.5 and TNNT2 as well as CALPONIN and low levels of DDR2, indicative of the presence of vascular smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts in addition to cardiomyocytes (Figure S4). Expression of CD31 was not detected, suggesting that endothelial cells are either not specified or supported under the conditions used. Genes indicative of hematopoietic commitment (GATA1), somitic mesoderm formation (MEOX), endoderm (FOXA2 and SOX17), and neuroectoderm (NEUROD1) development and maintenance of hESCs (OCT4) were not detected in the monolayer cultures, indicating that there was little contamination with undifferentiated hESCs or with other mesoderm- or germ layer-derived lineages. Through optimization of the cardiac mesoderm step, it is possible to generate an average of between 2 and 3 CTNT+ cardiomyocytes per input hESC by day 20 of culture. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that induction of human cardiac mesoderm can be monitored and isolated on the basis of KDR and PDGFR-α expression. In addition, they also show that EBs containing a large K+P+ population can generate a highly enriched cardiomyocyte population withou"

However, substantial variation has been reported among pluripotent cell lines, which could affect their utility and clinical safety. Such cell-line-specific differences must be better understood before one can confidently use embryonic stem (ES) or induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells in translational research. Toward this goal we have established genome-wide reference maps of DNA methylation and gene expression for 20 previously derived human ES lines and 12 human iPS cell lines, and we have measured the in vitro differentiation propensity of these cell lines. This resource enabled us to assess the epigenetic and transcriptional similarity of ES and iPS cells and to predict the differentiation efficiency of individual cell lines. The combination of assays yields a scorecard for quick and comprehensive characterization of pluripotent cell lines."

Very short and extremely bright, coherent X-ray pulses can be used to outrun key damage processes and obtain a single diffraction pattern from a large macromolecule, a virus or a cell before the sample explodes and turns into plasma. The continuous diffraction pattern of non-crystalline objects permits oversampling and direct phase retrieval. Here we show that high-quality diffraction data can be obtained with a single X-ray pulse from a non-crystalline biological sample, a single mimivirus particle, which was injected into the pulsed beam of a hard-X-ray free-electron laser, the Linac Coherent Light Source. Calculations indicate that the energy deposited into the virus by the pulse heated the particle to over 100,000 K after the pulse had left the sample. The reconstructed exit wavefront (image) yielded 32-nm full-period resolution in a single exposure and showed no measurable damage. The reconstruction indicates inhomogeneous arrangement of dense material inside the virion. We expect that significantly higher resolutions will be achieved in such experiments with shorter and brighter photon pulses focused to a smaller area. The resolution in such experiments can be further extended for samples available in multiple identical copies."

These characteristic 60–80 nm cup-shaped uncoated invaginations are highly enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids (Richter et al., 2008Richter T. Floetenmeyer M. Ferguson C. Galea J. Goh J.

Present at the plasma membrane of many cells with the exception of neurons and lymphocytes, they are particularly abundant in muscle cells, adipocytes, and endothelial cells.

USA. 1996; 93: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar) as the main constituents of the caveolar structure was instrumental to gain insight into the cell biology, structural, and genetic features of caveolae (Stan, 2005Stan R.V. Structure of caveolae.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1746: 334-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). They have been associated with endocytosis, cell signaling, lipid metabolism, and other functions in physiological as well as in pathological conditions. Nevertheless, the role of these specialized membrane domains remains debated, and little is known about the molecular mechanisms involved in their formation and proposed functions (Parton and Simons, 2007Parton R.G. Simons K. The multiple faces of caveolae.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). Recent studies have suggested that the distribution of Cav1 and caveolae-mediated signaling can be affected by external mechanical cues. In endothelial cells, chronic shear exposure activates the ERK pathway in a caveolae-dependent manner (Boyd et al., 2003Boyd N.L. Park H. Yi H. Boo Y.C. Sorescu G.P. Sykes M. Jo H.

Recruitment of endothelial caveolae into mechanotransduction pathways by flow conditioning in vitro.Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2003; 285: H1720-H1729PubMed Google Scholar). In smooth-muscle cells, cyclic stretch can cause association of some kinases with Cav1 (Sedding et al., 2005Sedding D.G. Hermsen J. Seay U. Eickelberg O. Kummer W. Schwencke C. Strasser R.H. Tillmanns H. Braun-Dullaeus R.C. Caveolin-1 facilitates mechanosensitive protein kinase B (Akt) signaling in vitro and in vivo.Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 635-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To date, the role of Cav1/caveolae in mechanotransduction is mainly viewed as a downstream signaling platform, whereas their function in primary mechanosensing has not been directly addressed. A recent theoretical study has proposed that budded membrane domains like caveolae could play the role of membrane-mediated sensors and regulators of the plasma membrane tension (Sens and Turner, 2006Sens P. Turner M.S. Budded membrane microdomains as tension regulators. Phys. Rev. E Stat.Nonlin. Soft Matter Physiol. 2006; 73: 031918Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Endowed with a high membrane and lipid storage capacity, owing to the invaginated structure and high lipid packing, caveolae are well equipped to play such a role. We have challenged the homeostasis of the plasma membrane tension with different types of controlled mechanical stresses and analyzed the role of caveolae in the cell short-term response. We show in endothelial cells and muscle cells that functional caveolae are required to buffer the variations of membrane tension induced by sudden and transient mechanical stress via a two-step process of rapid caveola disassembly and slower reassembly. We examined the response of caveolae when cells were exposed to acute mechanical stresses. Osmotic swelling causes an increase of the membrane tension of cells unless some additional membrane is delivered to the cell surface (Dai and Sheetz, 1995Dai J. Sheetz M.P. Regulation of endocytosis, exocytosis, and shape by membrane tension.Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1995; 60: 567-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, Dai et al., 1998Dai J.

Cell surface area regulation and membrane tension.J. Membr. Biol. 2001; 179: 79-102PubMed Google Scholar). Cav1-EGFP-transfected HeLa cells were exposed to hypo-osmotic medium (30 mOsm). We observed a 35% increase of the cell volume within the first 5 min and a slow decrease thereafter (Figures 1A and 1B ). Upon reversing back to iso-osmolarity (300 mOsm) after 30 min of hypotonic shock, the volume decreased below the initial cell volume. These observations support the existence of a compensatory mechanism known as regulatory volume decrease, which restores the osmotic balance by activating ion channels (D'Alessandro et al., 2002D'Alessandro M. Russell D. Morley S.M. Davies A.M. Lane E.B. Keratin mutations of epidermolysis bullosa simplex alter the kinetics of stress response to osmotic shock.J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4341-4351Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Our data, however, suggest that this process is not dominant during the first 5 min following hypo-osmotic shock. To distinguish caveolae at the plasma membrane from the internal Golgi pool of Cav1, we used total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy (Figure 1C and Figures S1A and S1B available online). Upon hypo-osmotic shock, we observed that the number of caveolae significantly decreased by ∼30% at the cell surface (Figures 1C and 1D) and that the loss correlated with the magnitude of the shock (Figure 1E). Importantly, the cell footprint and the adhesion between the cell and the glass surface were unaltered, as shown by reflection interference contrast microscopy (RICM) (Figure S1C). Because caveolae exhibit different types of dynamics at the plasma membrane (Pelkmans and Zerial, 2005Pelkmans L. Zerial M. Kinase-regulated quantal assemblies and kiss-and-run recycling of caveolae.Nature. 2005; 436: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), we also checked whether any particular pool was selectively affected. Within minutes of hypo-osmotic shock, slow-moving caveolae reduced their mobility (Figure S1D), and fast dynamics were abolished (Movie S1 and Movie S2), whereas caveolae displaying all kinds of mobility were reduced in number (Figures S1E and S1F). Similar results were obtained in mouse lung endothelial cells (MLEC) (Figure S1B). Although osmotic shocks have been extensively used to mimic the osmolarity changes that cells experience (Lang et al., 1998Lang F. Busch G.L. Ritter M. Völkl H. Waldegger S. Gulbins E. Häussinger D. Functional significance of cell volume regulatory mechanisms.Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 247-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar), we sought to rule out any indirect influence of cell swelling on caveolae. We developed a stretching device based on thin transparent silicone substrates to challenge the cell membrane with a different mechanical stress. It allowed imaging of caveolae by TIRF before and after stretch and was combined with micropatterning (Chen et al., 1997Chen C.S. Mrksich M. Huang S. Whitesides G.M. Ingber D.E. Geometric control of cell life and death.Science. 1997; 276: 1425-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3984) Google Scholar) to control the cell adhesion area and its orientation with the stretching axis. The number of caveolae present at the basal footprint of Cav1-EGFP HeLa cells decreased upon stretching (Figures 1F and 1G), and the loss correlated with the extent of stretch (Figure 1H). Therefore, acute mechanical stress induced either by hypo-osmotic shock or membrane stretching leads to a rapid and significant loss of caveolae from the cell surface. We next performed electron microscopy (EM) on MLEC. These endothelial cells experience chronic cycles of shear stress from the blood flow in lungs' vessels in vivo. MLEC immunostaining shows multiple subcellular Cav1 positive structures, which are localized predominantly at the plasma membrane and at the Golgi apparatus (Figure S3B; Murata et al., 2007Murata T. Lin M.I. Stan R.V. Bauer P.M. Yu J. Sessa W.C. Genetic evidence supporting caveolae microdomain regulation of calcium entry in endothelial cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16631-16643Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In contrast, Cav1−/− MLEC derived from cells knocked out for the CAV1 gene do not present any Cav1 staining. However, Cav1-EGFP expression can be induced by transfection in WT and Cav1−/− MLEC (Figure S3C). EM analysis showed a significant decrease of the number of caveolae (50%) upon a 5 min exposure of WT MLEC to a hypo-osmotic shock (Figures 2A and 2B ). These data confirm the results obtained by TIRF imaging and extend our conclusions to endogenous caveolae present on the entire surface of the cell.Figure S1Effect of Hypo-Osmotic Shock upon Plasma Membrane and Caveolae Distribution, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Caveolae detection was done by image analysis and it was checked for the characteristic quantal assembly of Cav1-EGFP in caveolae (Pelkmans and Zerial, 2005Pelkmans L.

The contribution of caveolae to the general endocytic activity of the cell is believed to be minimal (Nabi and Le, 2003Nabi I.R. Le P.U. Caveolae/raft-dependent endocytosis.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 673-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar), and endocytosis is disfavored at high membrane tension (Dai et al., 1997Dai J. Ting-Beall H.P. Sheetz M.P. The secretion-coupled endocytosis correlates with membrane tension changes in RBL 2H3 cells.J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We still tested whether the loss of caveolae upon hypo-osmotic was due to increased caveola endocytosis. We used dynasore, an inhibitor of the dynamin GTPase that is involved in caveola internalization (Henley et al., 1998Henley J.R. Krueger E.W. Oswald B.J. McNiven M.A. Dynamin-mediated internalization of caveolae.J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 85-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, Macia et al., 2006Macia E. Ehrlich M. Massol R. Boucrot E. Brunner C. Kirchhausen T. Dynasore, a cell-permeable inhibitor of dynamin.Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 839-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1387) Google Scholar). Indeed, dynasore significantly increased the caveolae density at the plasma membrane, reflecting the efficient inhibition of caveola endocytosis (Figure 2C). However, upon hypo-osmotic shock, a similar loss of caveolae was measured (Figures 2C and 2D). We next examined Cavin1, which is part of the caveolar complex and is required to maintain caveola invagination (Hill et al., 2008Hill M.M. Bastiani M. Luetterforst R. Kirkham M. Kirkham A. Nixon S.J. Walser P. Abankwa D. Oorschot V.M.

Cavin1 does not bind to free Cav1 oligomers or to Cav1 present on the Golgi apparatus. We found a high level (64%) of Cav1-EGFP colocalization with Cavin1-mCherry (Figure 2E). Upon hypo-osmotic shock, there was a similar or even higher loss of Cavin1-labeled structures, confirming the partial loss of caveolae (Figure 2F). We also observed a decreased colocalization with Cavin1 (35%) for the remaining caveolae, suggesting a loss of their invaginated structure. We quantified the interaction between Cav1 and Cavin1 using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). When Cavin1 is present in caveola, the close proximity of mRFP-Cav3 and Cavin1-EGFP results in FRET and a decrease in the EGFP fluorescence lifetime (Abankwa et al., 2008Abankwa D. Hanzal-Bayer M.

There was a significant increase in the fluorescence lifetime upon hypo-osmotic shock, indicating the dissociation of Cavin1 from Cav1 (Figure 2G). We also performed Cav1 immuno-EM on MLEC before and after hypo-osmotic shock (Figure 3A and Figure S2A ). We found a 10-fold increase in the number of gold particles associated with Cav1 in noncaveolar membranes after 5 min of hypo-osmotic shock (Figure 3B). Upon returning to iso-osmolarity, cells recovered the initial number of caveolae, and Cav1 was mainly associated with caveola (Figures 3B and 3C). Under iso-osmotic conditions, deep-etched EM showed a majority of budded caveolae with characteristic tight striated coats (Morone et al., 2006Morone N. Fujiwara T. Murase K. Kasai R.S. Ike H. Yuasa S. Usukura J. Kusumi A. Three-dimensional reconstruction of the membrane skeleton at the plasma membrane interface by electron tomography.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 851-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). After hypo-osmotic shock, several flat structures with loose striated coats reminiscent of formerly budded caveolae were observed. Upon iso-osmolarity recovery, all caveolae were budded (Figure 3D and Figure S2B for three-dimensional view). These findings clearly indicate that cells respond to acute mechanical membrane stress by the rapid flattening of a fraction of the caveola. We also measured the level of Cav1-EGFP diffusing freely at the membrane using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). At steady state, the fraction of freely diffusing Cav1 in the plasma membrane was low (10%; Figure 3E), as reported (Pelkmans et al., 2004Pelkmans L. Bürli T. Zerial M. Helenius A.

However, we measured a higher mobile fraction (30%) in cells exposed to hypo-osmotic shock for at least 10 min. This increase is likely to reflect the release of Cav1 from flattened caveolae.Figure S2Electron Micrographs of Cav1 Labeling and Stereo Electron Micrographs of Flat and Budded Caveola Structures by Deep Etch EM, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Immuno-EM images of ultrathin cryosections with gold-tagged Cav1 antibody of WT MLEC under iso-osmotic (Iso), hypo-osmotic (Hypo) and recovered iso-osmotic (Rec) conditions.

DNA methylation occurs primarily at CpG dinucleotides in mammals: CpG methylation marks that are lost on newly replicated DNA strands are faithfully restored by the maintenance DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1. In embryonic stem cells (ESCs), however, a substantial fraction of cytosine methylation occurs in non-CpG contexts, where it has been attributed to the activity of the de novo methyltransferases Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b (Lister et al., 2009Lister R.

USA. 2000; 97: 5237-5242Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Dynamic changes in DNA methylation occur during early embryogenesis (reviewed in Feng et al., 2010bFeng S. Jacobsen S.E. Reik W. Epigenetic reprogramming in plant and animal development.Science. 2010; 330: 622-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). Shortly after fertilization, the paternal genome loses the methylcytosine mark prior to DNA replication, whereas the maternal genome loses the mark passively in early cell cycles before blastulation. De novo methylation by Dnmt3 occurs around the time of blastocyst implantation, to a greater extent in the inner cell mass (ICM), which remains pluripotent and gives rise to all cell types of the embryo proper, than in the outer trophectoderm (TE) layer, which is restricted to an extraembryonic fate and gives rise to the placenta (Reik et al., 2001Reik W. Dean W. Walter J. Epigenetic reprogramming in mammalian development.Science. 2001; 293: 1089-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (2284) Google Scholar). During the formation of primordial germ cells in the mouse, a second wave of genome-wide demethylation occurs during which imprinted marks are erased; they are subsequently reset in the developing gametes through de novo DNA methylation. The tight regulation of DNA methylation and demethylation is developmentally of crucial importance because Dnmt-deficient (and therefore hypomethylated) ESCs and embryos lose lineage restriction and show transdifferentiation to the extraembryonic trophoblast lineage (Jackson et al., 2004Jackson M. Krassowska A. Gilbert N. Chevassut T. Forrester L. Ansell J. Ramsahoye B. Severe Global DNA Hypomethylation Blocks Differentiation and Induces Histone Hyperacetylation in Embryonic Stem Cells.Mol.

We recently identified the TET proteins TET1, TET2, and TET3 as a new family of enzymes that alter the methylation status of DNA (Iyer et al., 2009Iyer L.M. Tahiliani M. Rao A. Aravind L.

TET proteins are 2-oxoglutarate (2OG)- and Fe(II)-dependent dioxygenases that catalyze the hydroxylation of 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in DNA. TET proteins and 5hmC have been reported in many different tissues, and both 5hmC and Tet expression/activity are tightly regulated during ESC differentiation (Ito et al., 2010Ito S. D'Alessio A.C.

TET1 and TET2 are both implicated in cancer: TET1 is an MLL partner in rare cases of acute myeloid (AML) and lymphoid (ALL) leukemias, and loss-of-function of TET2 is strongly associated with AML as well as a variety of myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloproliferative disorders (see references in Ko et al., 2010Ko M. Huang Y. Jankowska A.M. Pape U.J. Tahiliani M. Bandukwala H.S. An J. Lamperti E.D. Koh K.P. Ganetzky R. et al.Impaired hydroxylation of 5-methylcytosine in myeloid cancers with mutant TET2.Nature. 2010; 468: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). Together, these data suggest that dysregulation of DNA methylation via TET proteins and hmC may have a role in ESC pluripotency, oncogenic transformation (especially of hematopoietic stem cells toward the myeloid lineage), and neuronal function. Here, we describe the function of Tet proteins (and, by inference, 5hmC) in mouse ESCs. ESC lines are culture explants from the inner cell mass (ICM) of the developing blastocyst. They can be maintained in the proliferative, undifferentiated state in culture by using the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) to activate STAT3 and the serum component bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) to induce inhibitor-of-differentiation proteins. When given the appropriate cellular signals, they can differentiate into cellular derivatives of the three primary germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. Withdrawal of LIF from serum-containing media allows BMP to switch from supporting self-renewal to inducing mesodermal and endodermal differentiation while blocking entry into neural lineages; when grown in the absence of both LIF signals and serum, ESCs are predisposed to convert to a neuronal fate (Ying et al., 2003aYing Q.-L. Nichols J. Chambers I. Smith A. BMP Induction of Id Proteins Suppresses Differentiation and Sustains Embryonic Stem Cell Self-Renewal in Collaboration with STAT3.Cell. 2003; 115: 281-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1631) Google Scholar, Ying et al., 2003bYing Q.-L. Stavridis M. Griffiths D. Li M. Smith A. Conversion of embryonic stem cells into neuroectodermal precursors in adherent monoculture.Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). These features of self-renewal and ability to differentiate, characteristic of a pluripotent state, require a high degree of epigenetic plasticity. Genes crucial for pluripotency are kept active by a self-organizing network of transcription factors and are rapidly silenced by histone modifications and DNA methylation during differentiation, whereas genes that are required later in cellular differentiation are held in a transiently repressed state by chromatin modifications that are easily reversed. Because Tet proteins modify DNA methylation status, it was conceivable that they might influence the expression and functions of either or both classes of genes. In culture conditions containing LIF and serum, Tet1 transcripts are present at high copy numbers in mouse ESCs, comparable to those of the pluripotency factor Oct4; Tet2 transcripts are about 5-fold less abundant than Tet1 but still well expressed; and Tet3 transcript levels are very low (Figure 1A ). Individual depletion of Tet1 or Tet2 mRNAs with SMARTpool siRNA duplexes (Figure S1A available online) resulted in a moderate decrease in 5hmC, whereas combined depletion of both enzymes reduced 5hmC levels by 75%–80% (Figures 1B and 1C; Figures S1B and S1C). Thus, Tet1 and Tet2 together are responsible for the bulk of 5hmC production in mouse ESCs cultured in the presence of LIF. In contrast to a previous report (Ito et al., 2010Ito S. D'Alessio A.C. Taranova O.V. Hong K. Sowers L.C. Zhang Y. Role of Tet proteins in 5mC to 5hmC conversion, ES-cell self-renewal and inner cell mass specification.Nature. 2010; 466: 1129-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1775) Google Scholar), we did not observe major changes in ESC morphology upon siRNA-mediated depletion of either Tet1 alone or both Tet1 and Tet2 (Figure S1D). When plated on gelatin in the presence of LIF, ESCs largely retained expression of Tet1, Tet2, and Oct4 over 4 to 5 days. Within 3 days of LIF withdrawal, Tet1 and Tet2 mRNA levels declined to 25%–30% of starting levels, with a time course that paralleled the decline of Oct4 mRNA (Figure 1D), and differentiated epithelial-like cells were observed in 4 to 5 days. When the ESCs were treated with retinoic acid (RA; a potent stimulus for cellular differentiation) at the same time that LIF was withdrawn, Tet1, and Oct4 expression declined more rapidly (Figure 1D), and epithelial-like morphology was apparent earlier, by day 3. Tet3 mRNA levels increased more than 10-fold under these conditions (Figure 1D). Under both conditions, 5hmC levels declined significantly, to 40%–60% of control (Tahiliani et al., 2009Tahiliani M. Koh K.P. Shen Y. Pastor W.A. Bandukwala H. Brudno Y. Agarwal S. Iyer L.M. Liu D.R. Aravind L. et al.Conversion of 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in mammalian DNA by MLL partner TET1.Science. 2009; 324: 930-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (3787) Google Scholar; Figure 1E); the moderate change (compared to that seen in Figures 1B and 1C) likely reflects both the incomplete loss of Tet1 and Tet2 under conditions of LIF withdrawal and the upregulation of Tet3 in response to RA (Figure 1D). We examined Tet expression and activity during reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by transduction with the four reprogramming transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006Takahashi K. Yamanaka S. Induction of pluripotent stem cells from mouse embryonic and adult fibroblast cultures by defined factors.Cell. 2006; 126: 663-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). The starting population of fibroblasts expressed almost no Tet1 mRNA and only a basal level of Tet2 mRNA, but fully reprogrammed iPSCs that had reactivated an endogenous Oct4-GFP reporter (Yeom et al., 1996Yeom Y.I. Fuhrmann G. Ovitt C.E. Brehm A. Ohbo K. Gross M. Hubner K. Scholer H.R. Germline regulatory element of Oct-4 specific for the totipotent cycle of embryonal cells.Development. 1996; 122: 881-894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) displayed levels of Tet1 and Tet2 mRNA comparable to those in ESCs; Tet3 transcripts also decreased, approaching the low level observed in ESCs (Figure 1F). In parallel, 5hmC levels increased, both globally and at MspI sites, from almost undetectable in fibroblasts to levels typical of ESCs in iPSCs (Figure 1G). Similar results were obtained during reprogramming of mouse adult tail-tip fibroblasts into iPSCs (data not shown). Collectively, these data point to a strong association of Tet1, Tet2, and 5hmC with the pluripotent state in both ESCs and iPSCs and a contrasting association of Tet3 with the differentiated state. We measured Tet mRNA levels during ESC differentiation induced by RNAi-mediated depletion of the key pluripotency factors Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog. ESCs treated with SMARTpool siRNA duplexes targeting Oct4 differentiated rapidly within 3 days. Differentiation induced by Sox2 RNAi was slower, requiring ∼5 days, but alkaline phosphatase-positive colonies were still present in ESCs treated with Nanog RNAi for 5 days (Figure S2A). We confirmed that each SMARTpool depleted expression of its target pluripotency factor (Figure S2B), although as expected, depletion of each pluripotency factor in ESCs also downregulated expression of the others because of known cross-regulatory and cooperative interactions (Chew et al., 2005Chew J.L. Loh Y.H. Zhang W. Chen X. Tam W.L. Yeap L.S. Li P. Ang Y.S. Lim B. Robson P. et al.Reciprocal transcriptional regulation of Pou5f1 and Sox2 via the Oct4/Sox2 complex in embryonic stem cells.Mol.

Liu J. et al.The Oct4 and Nanog transcription network regulates pluripotency in mouse embryonic stem cells.Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1848) Google Scholar). Oct4 and Sox2 RNAi resulted in potent repression of Tet1 and Tet2 mRNA, to < 20% and ∼30% of control levels, respectively; Tet3 mRNA was upregulated by ∼4-fold and ∼2-fold (Figure 2A ). Nanog RNAi had almost no effect on Tet1 and Tet3 while reducing Tet2 expression moderately, to ∼60% of control. TLC analysis at day 5 showed a marked loss of 5hmC at MspI sites only in cells treated with Oct4 siRNA (Figure 2B). Chromatin immunoprecipitation of biotin-tagged Oct4 from ESCs stably expressing the BirA biotin ligase (Kim et al., 2008Kim J. Chu J. Shen X. Wang J. Orkin S.H. A. extended transcriptional network for pluripotency of embryonic stem cells.Cell. 2008; 132: 1049-1061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar) showed that Oct4 bound to sites located within conserved noncoding sequence (CNS) regions of both the Tet1 and Tet2 genes (Figures 2C–2H). In both cases, the sites resembled consensus Oct4-Sox2 composite sites (Loh et al., 2006Loh Y.H. Wu Q. Chew J.L. Vega V.B. Zhang W. Chen X. Bourque G. George J. Leong B. Liu J. et al.The Oct4 and Nanog transcription network regulates pluripotency in mouse embryonic stem cells.Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1848) Google Scholar) and especially the Oct4 portion of the site was strongly conserved between human and mouse (Figures 2E and 2H). Oct4 binding sites were not detected in other CNS regions of the Tet1 locus (Figures S2C and S2D) or at two other predicted Oct4-Sox2 binding elements in CNS regions at ∼−140 kb and −200 kb 5′ of the Tet2 transcription start site. Although we have not tested formally whether these conserved Oct4-Sox2 composite sites function as transcriptional regulatory elements, the combined data suggest strongly that Tet1 and Tet2 are regulated by the Oct4-Sox2 complex. We characterized gene expression in ES cells after siRNA-mediated depletion of each of the three Tet proteins by quantitative RT-PCR. Tet mRNAs were maximally depleted by 3 days of transfection. Tet1 depletion had no effect on Tet2 mRNA expression and vice versa (Figure S1A). In contrast to a previous report that Tet1 depletion led to diminished Nanog mRNA and protein (Ito et al., 2010Ito S. D'Alessio A.C. Taranova O.V. Hong K. Sowers L.C. Zhang Y. Role of Tet proteins in 5mC to 5hmC conversion, ES-cell self-renewal and inner cell mass specification.Nature. 2010; 466: 1129-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1775) Google Scholar), Tet depletion did not affect expression of the key pluripotency factors Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog under our conditions for up to 5 days (Figure 3A ), nor was there a marked change in the undifferentiated appearance of ESCs maintained in LIF (Figure S1D). Rather, Tet1 depletion resulted in reproducible changes in expression of a panel of lineage-specific markers within 3–5 days: there was a reproducible increase in expression of mRNAs encoding the trophectoderm markers Cdx2, Eomes, and Hand1, and a consistent decrease in expression of the neuroectoderm markers Pax6 and Neurod1 and the Nodal antagonists Lefty1 and Lefty2 (Figure 3A, Figure S3A, and data not shown). Tet2 depletion had no effect on trophectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm markers but consistently caused a small increase in expression of Pax6, Neurod1, Lefty1, and Lefty2 (Figure 3A and Figure S3A), whereas Tet3 knockdown caused a 50% repression of Lefty2 but otherwise had no effect on all other targets tested (Figure S3A and data not shown). Combined depletion of Tet1 and Tet2, shown above to decrease genomic 5hmC levels almost to baseline (Figures 1B and 1C), had a similar but less striking effect compared to Tet1 depletion alone (Figure 3A), suggesting that Tet2 antagonizes the dominant effect of Tet1 at specific target genes. To explore the effect of prolonged depletion of Tet1 on ESC developmental potential, we generated ESC clones stably expressing shRNAs against Tet1 and Tet2. Two Tet1-depleted clones, generated using Tet1 shRNA#2, showed >80% decrease in Tet1 mRNA levels (Tet1-kd/shRNA#2.1 and #2.2; Figure S3B, left); likewise, two Tet2-depleted clones, generated using Tet2 siRNA sequences #1 and #3, showed ∼55% and ∼75% decrease in Tet2 mRNA levels, respectively (Tet2-kd/shRNA#1 and #3; Figure S3B, right). Control clones expressed an irrelevant shRNA (scramble [Scr]-kd) or shRNA directed against GFP (GFP-kd). The clones could be propagated serially on feeder cells in the absence of further selection and were morphologically indistinguishable from parental and control clones (Figure S3C). Growth proliferation rates of the selected Tet-kd clones were similar to or slightly enhanced compared to control clones (Figure S3D). Whole-genome transcriptome analysis of stable Tet1-kd versus control ESC clones largely confirmed the results from transient RNAi transfections; gene ontology (GO) analysis of differentially expressed genes yielded many terms related to embryonic development and cell-cycle regulation (Table S1). Possibly because of incomplete knockdown, most gene-expression changes in Tet1-kd ESCs were fairly modest (∼2- to 5-fold), and the cells retained a genome-wide molecular signature typical of normal ESCs. We injected control shRNA and Tet-kd ES clones intramuscularly into immunodeficient mice and observed teratoma formation. Within 4–7 weeks, control ESC lines formed well-differentiated benign teratomas containing cells representative of all three embryonic germ layers, whereas Tet1-kd clones formed large aggressive tumors with massive internal hemorrhage (Figures 3B–3D). Histologically, all three primary germ layer lineages could be found in Tet1-kd teratomas, but the relative contributions of each lineage appeared altered compared to controls (Figures 3C-D). Tet1-kd teratomas contained predominantly immature glandular tissue with surrounding stromal cells, indicative of definitive endoderm and mesoderm respectively; many of the glandular cells contained nuclei in mitotic phases, suggestive of a highly proliferative state (Figure 3E). There was considerably less neuroectoderm in the teratoma and many regions with necrotic tissue and blood (Figure 3D). A striking feature was the presence of many giant cells with large nuclei, found especially within and near the necrotic regions but also forming distinct clusters (Figure 3F); many of these cells contained glycogen-rich inclusion bodies, indicative of trophoblastic giant cells of the extra-embryonic lineage (Figure 3G). These histological features were independent of tumor size because sized-matched control teratomas grown to full size were typically not hemorrhagic, contained more neural tissue, and rarely contained any trophoblastic giant cells. Moreover, smaller Tet1-kd teratomas obtained with injection of fewer cells (105 instead of 106) still formed hemorrhagic tumors containing many giant cells (Figures S3E and S3F). Like Tet1-kd clones, Tet2-kd clones also formed large hemorrhagic teratomas that grew more aggressively than controls (Figure 3H). Both Tet2-kd clones, generated by stable expression of independent shRNA hairpins, displayed a similar phenotype of hemorrhagy, although the phenotype was stronger in Tet2-kd/shRNA#3-derived teratomas, correlating with stronger constitutive Tet2 knockdown (Figure S3A, right). Despite the hemorrhagic appearance, there was more neuroectoderm contribution in Tet2-kd teratomas, such that apart from the appearance of regions with necrotic tissue, most cellular features still resembled those of control teratomas (Figure 3I). Trophoblastic giant cells were also less apparent in Tet2-kd compared to Tet1-kd teratomas, appearing in clusters in only one oversized tumor harvested but otherwise barely represented in all other Tet2-kd tumors (data not shown). We conclude that Tet1 loss-of-function in ESCs results in developmental skewing toward endoderm/mesoderm and trophoblast lineages, whereas Tet2 loss-of-function maintains a tendency toward neuroectoderm. The upregulation of transcripts encoding the trophectodermal transcription factors Cdx2 and Eomes (Figure 3A), and the appearance of trophoblastic giant cells in Tet1-kd tumors (Figures 3F–3IG), suggested that Tet1 deficiency might attenuate the normal restriction of ESCs to embryonic tissues and permit their transdifferentiation into extra-embryonic trophoblast derivatives. Indeed, a previous report showed that when Tet1 siRNA was injected together with a marker gene into mouse embryos at the two-cell stage, the marked (presumably Tet1-depleted) cells were moderately excluded from the inner cell mass (ICM) and enriched in the trophectoderm (Ito et al., 2010Ito S. D'Alessio A.C. Taranova O.V. Hong K. Sowers L.C. Zhang Y. Role of Tet proteins in 5mC to 5hmC conversion, ES-cell self-renewal and inner cell mass specification.Nature. 2010; 466: 1129-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1775) Google Scholar). To explore this phenotype further, we cultured control and Tet1-kd clones on feeders in the presence of FGF4 and heparin, but without exogenous LIF, a culture condition previously described to favor the derivation of trophoblast stem (TS) cells from the trophectoderm of blastocysts (Tanaka et al., 1998Tanaka S. Kunath T. Hadjantonakis A.K. Nagy A. Rossant J. Promotion of trophoblast stem cell proliferation by FGF4.Science. 1998; 282: 2072-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). In these alternative “TS” culture conditions, Tet1 depletion did not result in obvious morphological changes: both control (scramble shRNA) and Tet1-kd ESCs formed dense undifferentiated colonies that tended to be flatter with jagged edges, thus showing some resemblance to true TS cells, which are flat with a ridge-like periphery (Figure S4A). After 2 weeks in TS cell culture conditions, we observed a robust and reproducible induction of Elf5 transcripts in Tet1-kd clones (50- to 200-fold increase in Elf5 mRNA over the low background expression seen in control clones, approaching ∼10%–20% of the levels observed in TS cells; Figure 4A ). Elf5 lies downstream of the early trophoblast lineage determinants Cdx2 and Eomes and was recently described as a commitment marker for the trophoblastic fate (Ng et al., 2008Ng R.K. Dean W. Dawson C. Lucifero D. Madeja Z. Reik W. Hemberger M. Epigenetic restriction of embryonic cell lineage fate by methylation of Elf5.Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 1280-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Moreover, whole-genome gene set enrichment analysis of Tet1-kd clones compared to control clones in TS conditions revealed significant enrichment (both FDR q value and FWER p value of 0.02) of a core set of genes defining trophectodermal cell differentiation, including Cdx2, Eomes, and Tead4 (Figure S4B). Expression of intermediate trophoblast (Tpbpa) or differentiated giant cell markers (PL1) in Tet1-kd clones was not observed during the course of TS cell culture, suggesting that the cells were being sustained in a TS-like state without overt differentiation into trophoblasts. To further investigate trophectoderm skewing, we cultured the Tet1-kd/shRNA#2.1 ESC clone for 2 weeks in TS culture conditions, picked three subclones, Tet1-kd/shRNA#2.1-sc1, .2, and .3 based on flattened TS-like morphology, and propagated them in TS culture conditions. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of these subclones showed a dramatic induction of Cdx2, Eomes, and Elf5 expression compared to cont"

However, reported variability in the behavior of iPSCs has called their utility into question. We established a test set of 16 iPSC lines from seven individuals of varying age, sex and health status, and extensively characterized the lines with respect to pluripotency and the ability to terminally differentiate. Under standardized procedures in two independent laboratories, 13 of the iPSC lines gave rise to functional motor neurons with a range of efficiencies similar to that of human embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Although three iPSC lines were resistant to neural differentiation, early neuralization rescued their performance. Therefore, all 16 iPSC lines passed a stringent test of differentiation capacity despite variations in karyotype and in the expression of early pluripotency markers and transgenes. This iPSC and ESC test set is a robust resource for those interested in the basic biology of stem cells and their applications."

Maintaining the proper balance of PI4P levels through the regulation of phosphoinositide (PI) kinases and phosphatases is critical. Sac1-like PI phosphatases are important regulators of PI4P turnover and are implicated in disease (Liu and Bankaitis, 2010Liu Y. Bankaitis V.A.

Inactivation of Sac1 PI phosphatase activity provided by Sac1 and the synaptojanin-like proteins, Sjl2 and Sjl3, results in massive PI4P accumulation, secretory defects, and lethality (Foti et al., 2001Foti M.

In mammalian cells, depletion of Sac1 leads to elevated cellular PI4P levels, Golgi fragmentation, and defects in mitotic spindle organization (Liu et al., 2008Liu Y. Boukhelifa M. Tribble E.

Although Sac1 PI phosphatases are key modulators of PI4P metabolism, little is known about their regulation. Both yeast and mammalian Sac1 are integral membrane proteins localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi (Faulhammer et al., 2007Faulhammer F. Kanjilal-Kolar S. Knodler A. Lo J. Lee Y.

Chem. 2000; 275: 34293-34305Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Upon starvation in yeast, or in the absence of growth factors in mammalian cells, Sac1 traffics from the ER to the Golgi where it antagonizes PI4P synthesis and Golgi function (Blagoveshchenskaya et al., 2008Blagoveshchenskaya A.

Although roles for Sac1 in the control of PI4P pools at the ER and Golgi are known, less is understood about how Sac1 regulates PI4P levels at the PM. Previous studies indicate that sac1Δ mutant yeast cells accumulate PI4P at the PM generated by the PI 4-kinase Stt4 (Baird et al., 2008Baird D. Stefan C. Audhya A. Weys S. Emr S.D.

Yet, Sac1 is not known to traffic to the PM, nor is it known if Sac1 regulates PM PI4P pools from the ER. A recent study describing the molecular structure of the Sac1 catalytic domain suggests that Sac1 may act in trans from the ER to turn over PI4P at the PM (Manford et al., 2010Manford A. Xia T. Saxena A.K. Stefan C. Hu F. Emr S.D. Mao Y. Crystal structure of the yeast Sac1: implications for its phosphoinositide phosphatase function.EMBO J. 2010; 29: 1489-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, factors that link Sac1 PI phosphatase activity to PI4P at the PM are unknown. We find that PI4P metabolism and Sac1 function require the oxysterol-binding homology (Osh) protein family. In particular, Osh3 assembles at cortical ER (cER) structures in response to PM PI4P levels. We reconstitute Osh protein-stimulated Sac1 PI phosphatase activity against PI4P-containing liposomes in vitro. In addition the ER membrane VAP proteins, Scs2 and Scs22, control PM PI4P levels in vivo and Sac1 activity in vitro. We propose that the Osh and VAP proteins regulate Sac1 PI phosphatase activity at PM/ER membrane contact sites. We also discuss potential roles for these proteins in the control of PI metabolism at additional membrane contact sites. Membrane junctions between the ER and other organelles are sites for lipid transfer and metabolism, Ca2+ transport and signaling, and the downregulation of insulin and growth factor receptors (reviewed in Lev, 2010Lev S. Non-vesicular lipid transport by lipid-transfer proteins and beyond.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 739-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Thus, modulation of PI levels at membrane contact sites may provide a fundamental mechanism for signaling between cellular membrane compartments. Yeast Sac1 is an integral membrane protein that localizes to nuclear and peripheral ER compartments (Figure 1A ) (Foti et al., 2001Foti M. Audhya A. Emr S.D. Sac1 lipid phosphatase and Stt4 phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase regulate a pool of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate that functions in the control of the actin cytoskeleton and vacuole morphology.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2396-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Yet, PI4P is generated by the PI 4-kinases Stt4 and Pik1 at the PM and the Golgi, respectively (Figure 1E) (Audhya et al., 2000Audhya A. Foti M. Emr S.D. Distinct roles for the yeast phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases, Stt4p and Pik1p, in secretion, cell growth, and organelle membrane dynamics.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2673-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). It is not known whether ER-embedded Sac1 turns over these distinct PI4P pools. Sac1 traffics between the ER and Golgi to regulate PI4P levels at these intracellular compartments (Faulhammer et al., 2007Faulhammer F. Kanjilal-Kolar S. Knodler A. Lo J. Lee Y. Konrad G. Mayinger P. Growth control of Golgi phosphoinositides by reciprocal localization of sac1 lipid phosphatase and pik1 4-kinase.Traffic. 2007; 8: 1554-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, to our knowledge, Sac1 has not been found at the PM. We reasoned that ER-localized Sac1 might control PM PI4P pools at PM/ER membrane contact sites where the peripheral ER closely apposes the PM (within 10 nm) (Figure 1B). Although Sac1 localizes to the peripheral ER (Figure 1A), no proteins that regulate Sac1 activity at PM/ER membrane contact sites are known. We hypothesized that a PI4P effector might link PI4P at the PM to Sac1 at the ER (Figure 1B). For this we focused on the PI4P-binding proteins Osh1, Osh2, and Osh3, members of the oxysterol-binding protein homology family (Figure 1C). Osh2 and Osh3 possess PH domains that bind PI4P and localize to cortical, punctate structures (Figure 1C, Figure 2A , and Figure S2 available online) (Levine and Munro, 2001Levine T.P. Munro S. Dual targeting of Osh1p, a yeast homologue of oxysterol-binding protein, to both the Golgi and the nucleus-vacuole junction.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1633-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, Roy and Levine, 2004Roy A. Levine T.P.

Osh1 also contains a PH domain but localizes to the Golgi and nuclear-vacuolar membrane junction sites (Levine and Munro, 2001Levine T.P. Munro S. Dual targeting of Osh1p, a yeast homologue of oxysterol-binding protein, to both the Golgi and the nucleus-vacuole junction.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1633-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Osh1, Osh2, and Osh3 are similar to mammalian oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) that contains a PI4P-binding PH domain (Figure 1C). These proteins are members of the OSBP-related protein (ORP) family that contain sterol-binding OSBP-related domains (ORDs) (Figure 1C). Among the ORP family, Osh4/Kes1 does not possess a PH domain but also binds PI lipids (Figure 1C) (Li et al., 2002Li X. Rivas M.P. Fang M. Marchena J. Mehrotra B. Chaudhary A. Feng L. Prestwich G.D.

Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 63-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Osh4/Kes1 is also known to regulate PI4P levels at the Golgi (Fairn et al., 2007Fairn G.D. Curwin A.J. Stefan C.J. McMaster C.R. The oxysterol binding protein Kes1p regulates Golgi apparatus phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate function.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 15352-15357Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, Li et al., 2002Li X. Rivas M.P. Fang M. Marchena J. Mehrotra B. Chaudhary A. Feng L. Prestwich G.D. Bankaitis V.A.

Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 63-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Given the properties of the Osh protein family to bind PI4P, regulate PI4P (in the case of Osh4/Kes1), and to localize to membrane contact sites, we further examined the role of the Osh proteins in PI4P metabolism. First, we measured PI4P levels in cells lacking Osh protein function. For this we utilized strains that lack the OSH1-OSH7 genes and carry wild-type OSH4 or a temperature-sensitive allele, osh4-1, on a plasmid because loss of all Osh proteins is lethal (oshΔ:CEN OSH4 or oshΔ:CEN osh4ts cells) (Beh and Rine, 2004Beh C.T. Rine J. A role for yeast oxysterol-binding protein homologs in endocytosis and in the maintenance of intracellular sterol-lipid distribution.J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2983-2996Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In 3H-inositol labeling experiments, PI4P levels were 6- to 7-fold higher than wild-type cells in oshΔ:CEN OSH4 and oshΔ:CEN osh4ts cells at the permissive temperature (26°C) (Figure 1D), suggesting that Osh proteins (other than Osh4) control PI4P levels in vivo. At the restrictive temperature for oshΔ:CEN osh4ts cells, PI4P levels were elevated 18-fold above wild-type levels (38°C) (Figure 1D) and were greater than PI4P levels in sac1Δ mutant cells (13-fold above wild-type) (Figure 1D). Expression levels of a Sac1-GFP fusion were slightly reduced in oshΔ:CEN osh4ts mutant cells at 38°C (approximately 3-fold) (Figure S1A ). This did not account for the 18-fold increase in PI4P in oshΔ:CEN osh4ts cells because complete loss of Sac1 resulted in only a 13-fold increase in PI4P (sac1Δ cells) (Figure 1D). Moreover, GFP-Sac1 localized to both nuclear and peripheral ER compartments in wild-type and oshΔ:CEN osh4ts cells at 38°C (Figure S1B). The 18-fold increase in PI4P levels in oshΔ:CEN osh4ts mutant cells resembled levels previously reported for triple mutant sac1ts sjl2Δ sjl3Δ cells (Foti et al., 2001Foti M. Audhya A. Emr S.D. Sac1 lipid phosphatase and Stt4 phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase regulate a pool of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate that functions in the control of the actin cytoskeleton and vacuole morphology.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2396-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), suggesting that the Osh proteins may regulate multiple Sac1-like PI phosphatase activities. We also examined PI4P levels in cells lacking both Sac1 and Osh protein function to test for additive effects. PI4P levels were not further elevated in sac1ts oshΔ:CEN osh4ts cells compared to oshΔ:CEN osh4ts cells at 38°C (Figure S1C and Table S3), suggesting that Sac1 and the Osh proteins act in a common pathway. Together, these results implicate the Osh proteins in PI4P metabolism and Sac1 phosphatase function.Figure S2Osh3 Localizes to PM/ER Contact Sites, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Osh3-GFP localization in wild-type cells co-expressing the DsRed-HDEL ER marker (top).

The PI4P FLARE (fluorescent lipid-associated reporter) GFP-2xPHOsh2 is found at Golgi compartments and the PM via Pik1 and Stt4 PI 4-kinase activities, respectively, in wild-type cells (Figure 1E) (Roy and Levine, 2004Roy A.

Chem. 2004; 279: 44683-44689Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In contrast the PI4P FLARE was stabilized at the PM in oshΔ:CEN OSH4 and oshΔ:CEN osh4ts cells, although weak fluorescence at intracellular puncta was detected (Figure 1E). The PI4P FLARE was also increased at the PM in sac1Δ cells, consistent with elevated levels of Stt4-generated PI4P at the PM (Figure 1E) (Baird et al., 2008Baird D. Stefan C. Audhya A. Weys S.

Although previous studies have implicated one Osh family member, Osh4/Kes, in PI4P regulation at the Golgi (Fairn et al., 2007Fairn G.D. Curwin A.J. Stefan C.J. McMaster C.R.

Several lines implicated Osh2 and Osh3 in the control of PI4P metabolism at the PM. First, both bind PI4P and localize to cortical structures (Figure 1C, Figure 2A, and Figure S2A) (Levine and Munro, 2001Levine T.P. Munro S.

Second, expression of OSH2 or OSH3 from a plasmid partially rescued the increased PI4P levels in oshΔ:CEN osh4ts mutant cells at 38°C (from 18-fold above wild-type to 5- and 8-fold, respectively) (Table S3). Third, osh2Δ osh3Δ double mutant cells displayed elevated PI4P levels, as measured by 3H-inositol labeling experiments (2.7-fold above wild-type) (Figure 2B and Table S3). Lastly, the PI4P FLARE was stabilized at the PM in osh2Δ osh3Δ double mutant cells (particularly in mother cells), compared to wild-type cells (Figure 2B). We examined if Osh3 localized to PM/ER membrane contact sites in order to regulate PI4P at the PM. Osh3-GFP localized to cortical patches often associated with cER compartments marked with DsRed-HDEL (Figure 2A, arrows), as well as the PM stained with filipin (Figure S2A). To confirm that Osh3 patches associated with cER, we examined Osh3-GFP localization in cells lacking the reticulons Rtn1, Rtn2, and Yop1 because the cER displays expanded sheet-like structures in these mutant cells (Voeltz et al., 2006Voeltz G.K. Prinz W.A. Shibata Y. Rist J.M. Rapoport T.A. A class of membrane proteins shaping the tubular endoplasmic reticulum.Cell. 2006; 124: 573-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Osh3-GFP patches clustered at cER compartments (marked with DsRed-HDEL) adjacent to the PM (stained with filipin) in rtn1Δ rtn2Δ yop1Δ triple mutant cells and was absent from regions lacking cER structures (Figure S2A). Together, our results suggested that Osh3 localizes to PM/ER membrane contact sites and modulates PM PI4P levels, possibly by regulation of cER-localized Sac1. Osh3 localization did not always coincide with cER compartments (Figure 2A, asterisk), suggesting that its assembly at PM/ER membrane contact sites may be dynamic and progress in regulated stages. Thus, we tested if Osh3 localization and function required PM PI4P. Osh3-GFP localized diffusely in the cytoplasm in cells with impaired Stt4 PI 4-kinase activity (stt4ts cells; Figure 2C), showing that Osh3 localization required PM PI4P synthesis. In contrast, Osh3-GFP was present at the PM in pik1ts mutant cells impaired in PI4P synthesis at the Golgi, although Osh3 was observed at intracellular structures in these cells (Figure S2B). Likewise, Osh3-GFP localized to cortical patches in cells with reduced PI(4,5)P2 levels (mss4ts cells) (Figure S2B). A form of Osh3 lacking its PH domain (Osh3ΔPH-GFP) did not rescue the growth defects of oshΔ:CEN osh4ts mutant cells at 38°C (Figure 2D). In addition, Osh3ΔPH-GFP displayed increased cytoplasmic localization, compared to wild-type Osh3-GFP (Figure S2C). Thus, the assembly of Osh3 at cortical patches required PM PI4P synthesis, consistent with its ability to bind PI4P and control PM PI4P levels. Next, we asked if other regions in Osh3 play a role in its function. Osh3 contains an FFAT motif (di-phenylalanines within an acidic track) (Figures 1C, 2D, and 3A ). FFAT motifs bind the MSP domains of the yeast ER membrane proteins Scs2 and Scs22, orthologs of the mammalian ER membrane VAP proteins (Figure 3A) (Kaiser et al., 2005Kaiser S.E. Brickner J.H. Reilein A.R. Fenn T.D. Walter P. Brunger A.T. Structural basis of FFAT motif-mediated ER targeting.Structure. 2005; 13: 1035-1045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, Loewen et al., 2003Loewen C.J. Roy A. Levine T.P. A conserved ER targeting motif in three families of lipid binding proteins and in Opi1p binds VAP.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2025-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). A form of Osh3 bearing substitutions in the FFAT motif (Osh3AAAT-GFP) partially rescued the growth defects of oshΔ:CEN osh4ts cells at 38°C (Figure 2D) and assembled at cortical patches (Figure S2C). A previous study reported that a mutant form of Osh3 with substitutions in the FFAT motif was mislocalized from the cER (Loewen et al., 2003Loewen C.J. Roy A. Levine T.P. A conserved ER targeting motif in three families of lipid binding proteins and in Opi1p binds VAP.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2025-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). However, this study used a GFP-Osh3 fusion that required Scs2 overexpression to target to the cER. Consistent with this previous study, we found that Osh3-GFP targeting to the cER was impaired in scs2Δ scs22Δ double mutant cells (see Figure S3D ). As expected, substitution of the FFAT motif in combination with deletion of the PH domain (GFP-Osh3ΔPH, AAAT) (Figure 2D) resulted in inactivation of Osh3 because this mutant protein did not rescue the growth defect of oshΔ:CEN osh4ts cells (Figure 2D). Moreover, Osh3ΔPH,AAAT-GFP localized diffusely in the cytoplasm, and not at cortical patches (Figure S2C). Thus, Osh3 undergoes multiple interactions involving at least PI4P and the Scs2/Scs22 VAP proteins to assemble and function at PM/ER membrane contact sites.Figure S3Sac1 and Osh3 Expression and Localization in Cells Lacking the VAP Proteins, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Sac1-GFP localizes to the ER (marked with DsRed-HDEL) in wild-type and scs2Δ scs22Δ cells.

https://openalex.org/W1982750011,"The principal immune mechanism against biotrophic pathogens in plants is the resistance (R)-gene-mediated defence. It was proposed to share components with the broad-spectrum basal defence machinery. However, the underlying molecular mechanism is largely unknown. Here we report the identification of novel genes involved in R-gene-mediated resistance against downy mildew in Arabidopsis and their regulatory control by the circadian regulator, CIRCADIAN CLOCK-ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1). Numerical clustering based on phenotypes of these gene mutants revealed that programmed cell death (PCD) is the major contributor to resistance. Mutants compromised in the R-gene-mediated PCD were also defective in basal resistance, establishing an interconnection between these two distinct defence mechanisms. Surprisingly, we found that these new defence genes are under circadian control by CCA1, allowing plants to 'anticipate' infection at dawn when the pathogen normally disperses the spores and time immune responses according to the perception of different pathogenic signals upon infection. Temporal control of the defence genes by CCA1 differentiates their involvement in basal and R-gene-mediated defence. Our study has revealed a key functional link between the circadian clock and plant immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2046329243,"p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) is known to be an important mediator of the DNA damage response, with dimethylation of histone H4 lysine 20 (H4K20me2) critical to the recruitment of 53BP1 to double-strand breaks (DSBs). However, it is not clear how 53BP1 is specifically targeted to the sites of DNA damage, as the overall level of H4K20me2 does not seem to increase following DNA damage. It has been proposed that DNA breaks may cause exposure of methylated H4K20 previously buried within the chromosome; however, experimental evidence for such a model is lacking. Here we found that H4K20 methylation actually increases locally upon the induction of DSBs and that methylation of H4K20 at DSBs is mediated by the histone methyltransferase MMSET (also known as NSD2 or WHSC1) in mammals. Downregulation of MMSET significantly decreases H4K20 methylation at DSBs and the subsequent accumulation of 53BP1. Furthermore, we found that the recruitment of MMSET to DSBs requires the γH2AX-MDC1 pathway; specifically, the interaction between the MDC1 BRCT domain and phosphorylated Ser 102 of MMSET. Thus, we propose that a pathway involving γH2AX-MDC1-MMSET regulates the induction of H4K20 methylation on histones around DSBs, which, in turn, facilitates 53BP1 recruitment."

Here, we investigate how cell shape affects the positioning of the nucleus, spindle and subsequent cell division plane. To manipulate geometrical parameters in a systematic manner, we place individual sea urchin eggs into microfabricated chambers of defined geometry (e.g., triangles, rectangles, and ellipses). In each shape, the nucleus is positioned at the center of mass and is stretched by microtubules along an axis maintained through mitosis and predictive of the future division plane. We develop a simple computational model that posits that microtubules sense cell geometry by probing cellular space and orient the nucleus by exerting pulling forces that scale to microtubule length. This model quantitatively predicts division-axis orientation probability for a wide variety of cell shapes, even in multicellular contexts, and estimates scaling exponents for length-dependent microtubule forces."

Lineage commitment defects in progenitor cells from BRCA1-mutation carriers Luminal cells from BRCA1-mutation carriers give rise to basal-like cancers Slug suppresses progenitor cell luminal lineage commitment Slug expression is necessary for regulating basal-like breast cancer phenotypes Tumor suppressor genes, such as BRCA1, repress malignant transformation by ensuring the fidelity of DNA replication and chromosomal segregation in response to potentially deleterious events. The increased risk of breast cancer development in individuals with inherited mutations in BRCA1 has been attributed to compromised DNA damage repair activity (Welcsh and King, 2001Welcsh P.L. King M.C. BRCA1 and BRCA2 and the genetics of breast and ovarian cancer.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 705-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). However, it has been unclear why mutations in BRCA1 are also preferentially associated with an increased propensity for developing a specific subtype of breast cancers, basal-like tumors, with a distinct molecular phenotype and a poor prognosis (Foulkes et al., 2004Foulkes W.D.

Recent evidence has indicated that BRCA1 might function to regulate mammary epithelial cell morphogenesis and differentiation (Furuta et al., 2005Furuta S. Jiang X. Gu B. Cheng E. Chen P.L. Lee W.H.

Whether these functions of BRCA1 directly relate to the increased development of basal-like breast cancer, however, is not known. Human breast tissue contains two major specialized epithelial cell types: luminal cells with secretory functions surrounding the inner breast duct lumen and basal/myoepithelial cells with contractile functions that interface between luminal cells and the basement membrane. Corresponding to these cell states, human breast cancers are broadly classified into luminal-like or basal-like tumors based on their gene expression patterns (Peppercorn et al., 2008Peppercorn J. Perou C.M. Carey L.A. Molecular subtypes in breast cancer evaluation and management: divide and conquer.Cancer Invest. 2008; 26: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Accordingly, it has been proposed that tumors with “luminal” characteristics may result from the transformation of cells within the luminal lineage, whereas tumors exhibiting “basal-like” differentiation may arise from basal cells. However, there is also a wealth of evidence indicating that breast tumors exhibiting luminal or basal-like differentiation have distinct constellations of genetic aberrations, which may also influence tumor phenotype. For example, luminal tumors frequently express elevated levels of cyclin D1 (CCND1) and sustain mutations in phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) (Gauthier et al., 2007Gauthier M.L. Berman H.K. Miller C.

Moreover, as mentioned above, inherited mutations in BRCA1 (BRCA1mut/+) strongly predispose for the formation of basal-like tumors (Foulkes, 2003Foulkes W.D.

In principle, the predisposition for basal-like tumors in BRCA1-mutation carriers could result either from the differentiation state of the precursor cells or from the genetic alterations acquired during tumor formation. In this study, we examined the biology of disease-free breast tissues from patients harboring deleterious mutations in BRCA1. In doing so, we found a relationship between genetic alterations in perturbing mammary progenitor differentiation and their influence on tumor phenotype. To examine the connection between the role of BRCA1 in breast progenitor cell differentiation with the susceptibility of BRCA1-mutation carriers to developing basal-like breast cancers, we used a recently described method for creating human breast tissues in vivo (Proia and Kuperwasser, 2006Proia D.A. Kuperwasser C. Reconstruction of human mammary tissues in a mouse model.Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 206-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, Wu et al., 2009Wu M. Jung L. Cooper A.B. Fleet C. Chen L. Breault L. Clark K. Cai Z. Vincent S. Bottega S. et al.Dissecting genetic requirements of human breast tumorigenesis in a tissue transgenic model of human breast cancer in mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 7022-7027Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This method involves three distinct temporal steps: (1) clearing of the murine mammary fat pad, (2) reconstitution of the mammary fat pad with human stromal cells, and (3) introduction of lentiviral-infected organoids comixed with activated fibroblasts into the humanized fat pad. Because this system does not require any cell culture, the likelihood of genetic alterations or the selection of variant phenotypes during in vitro expansion is minimized. In an attempt to generate tumors from patient-derived breast epithelial cells, we modified step (3) above by introducing oncogenes into dissociated single cell suspensions of epithelial cells before introducing them into humanized stroma (Figure 1A ). We chose a set of oncogenes reflective of both the luminal and basal tumor classes to reduce the potential for genetic bias toward either tumor subtype. We infected uncultured breast epithelial cell suspensions obtained from dissociated reduction mammoplasty tissues with lentiviruses harboring genes for a mutated form of p53 (p53R175H), wild-type cyclin D1 (CCND1), a constitutively activated form of P13K (PI3KCA), and an oncogenic form of K-ras (RasG12V). Breast tumors developed when all four genes were introduced simultaneously into the breast epithelial cells (Figures 1B and 1C). Tumor formation with this procedure was observed with reduction mammoplasty tissues obtained from multiple patient samples. Expression of the introduced genes in the generated breast tumors was verified by immunostaining (for p53, cyclin D1, and p-Akt) and RT-PCR (for K-ras) (Figure 1D). Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stains of tumor sections revealed that the tumors were heterogeneous invasive carcinomas with regions of mixed squamous and papillary features (Figure 1E; Figure S1 available online). Immunostaining showed that cancer cells in squamous metaplastic regions expressed markers indicative of basal differentiation (cytokeratin 14 [CK14], p63, and vimentin [VIM]) and those within papillary regions expressed luminal markers (estrogen receptor [ER], CK8/18, and CK19) (Figure 1E). We next applied this transformation protocol to mammary epithelial cells obtained from prophylactic mastectomy tissues from patients harboring deleterious mutations in BRCA1 (BRCA1mut/+) (Table S1, Figure S1). We observed that the identical set of oncogenes was sufficient to transform epithelial cells obtained from BRCA1mut/+ patients (Figure 2A ). Although the introduced oncogenes were expressed to the same extent in wild-type and BRCA1 tumor tissues, immunostaining of tissue sections revealed strong expression of the basal epithelial markers CK14, p63, and vimentin in BRCA1mut/+ tumor cells (Figures 2B and 2C). In addition, although tumors arising from BRCA1+/+ epithelium exhibited regions that were CK8/18 and ER positive, tumors arising from BRCA1mut/+ cells showed a statistically significant reduction in both CK8/18 and ER expression and increased CK14 expression, which is typical of basal-like tumors (Figure 2C). To evaluate more comprehensively whether the tumors generated from BRCA1mut/+ epithelium exhibited increased basal-like features, we performed global gene expression analyses (Table S2). Hierarchical clustering indicated that tumors arising from either BRCA1+/+ or BRCA1mut/+ epithelium could be segregated from one another based on global transcriptional profiles (Figure 2D). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that BRCA1mut/+ tumors exhibited a significant upregulation of genes associated with breast epithelial basal/myoepithelial cell differentiation compared to the tumors arising from BRCA1+/+ cells (Figure 2E: basal gene set I, p < 0.024; basal gene set II, p < 10−4; Table S3). In addition, GSEA indicated specific upregulation of genes in the human breast cancer “basal-like” centroid, which identifies the human basal-like tumor phenotype (Hu et al., 2006Hu Z. Fan C. Oh D.S. Marron J.S. He X. Qaqish B.F. Livasy C. Carey L.A. Reynolds E. Dressler L. et al.The molecular portraits of breast tumors are conserved across microarray platforms.BMC Genomics. 2006; 7: 96Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar) in BRCA1mut/+ tumors (basal centroid, Figure 2E, p < 0.033; Table S3) relative to BRCA1+/+ tumors. Collectively, these results indicate that compared to BRCA1+/+ tumors, BRCA1mut/+ tumors generated with identical transforming oncogenes exhibited increased basal-like differentiation. Because the BRCA1+/+ and BRCA1mut/+ tumors were generated with identical oncogenes, these results suggest that the predisposition of BRCA1mut/+ patients for developing basal-like tumors may result from cellular distinctions present prior to neoplastic transformation. We therefore purified breast epithelial cells from BRCA1+/+ and BRCA1mut/+ disease-free breast tissues and assessed the differentiation state of normal precursors in age-matched breast tissue samples. BRCA1+/+ and BRCA1mut/+ breast epithelial cells expressed similar levels of BRCA1 transcript and protein (Figure S2). However, gene-expression profiling indicated that many genes were differentially expressed between BRCA1+/+ and BRCA1mut/+ epithelial cells (Figure 3A ; Table S4; Figure S2). Examination of gene ontology functional processes indicated that a number of genes associated with DNA transcription (repressor and activator), DNA binding, establishment and/or maintenance of chromatin architecture, and chromatin assembly or disassembly were differentially expressed in BRCA1mut/+ epithelium relative to BRCA1+/+ epithelium (Figure 3B). Examination of genes associated with epithelial differentiation revealed that luminal genes and various hormone-related genes including progesterone and estrogen beta receptors (PGR, ESR2) (Table S4) were downregulated in BRCA1mut/ + cells, while genes associated with progenitor or basal cells were upregulated (Figure 3A; Table S4). We confirmed these differences in differentiation by using semiquantitative immunohistochemistry (Allred scoring metric, see Experimental Procedures) applied to disease-free prophylactic mastectomy tissues obtained from BRCA1mut/+ carriers and age-matched reduction mammoplasty tissues from BRCA1+/+ noncarriers. Consistent with the microarray results, progesterone receptor (PGR) expression was significantly reduced in luminal epithelial cells in 88% of BRCA1mut/+ tissues compared to only 11% of BRCA1+/+ breast tissues (Allred score > 5, p < 0.001) (Figure 3C; Table S5). In addition, trefoil factor 3 (TFF3), which is also associated with mature luminal differentiation, was nearly absent in 88% of BRCA1mut/+ tissues compared to only 36% of BRCA1+/+ tissues (Allred score < 4, p < 0.0398; Figure 3C; Table S5). In contrast, 88% of BRCA1mut/+ tissue samples exhibited moderate-to-high expression of the basal marker vimentin compared to 16% of BRCA1+/+ tissues (Figure 3C; Table S5; p < 0.086). We next used flow cytometry to assess the proportion of lineage-committed and progenitor epithelial cells in breast tissues. Cells expressing CD24 or high levels of EpCAM (ESA) enrich for cells of the luminal lineage, whereas cells expressing high levels of CD49f enrich for cells of the myoepithelial (ME)/basal lineage (Villadsen et al., 2007Villadsen R.

Analysis of reduction mammoplasty breast tissues from BRCA1+/+ patients identified four populations of epithelial cells: EpCAMhi/CD49f− mature luminal cells, EpCAMhi/CD49f+ luminal progenitor cells, EpCAMlow/CD49f+ basal/myoepithelial (ME) cells, and EpCAM−/CD49f+ basal progenitor cells (Figure 3D; Figure S2; Keller et al., 2010Keller P.J.

Analysis of prophylactic mastectomy tissues from BRCA1mut/+ (<50 year) tissues also identified four populations of epithelial cells but revealed a statistically significant increase in the proportion of EpCAM−/CD49f+ basal progenitor cells (p < 0.04; Figure 3D) and an appreciable but not statistically significant decrease in the number of EpCAMhi/CD49f+ luminal progenitor cells. These results indicate that BRCA1mut/+ tissues exhibit luminal and basal epithelial cell differentiation defects prior to any evidence of cancer. We next evaluated progenitor activity of mammary epithelial cells obtained directly from breast tissues. We employed mammosphere (Dontu et al., 2003Dontu G. Abdallah W. Foley J.F. Jackson K. Clarke M. Kawamura M. Wicha M.S. In vitro propagation and transcriptional profiling of human mammary stem/progenitor cells.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1253-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (1887) Google Scholar) and adherent colony-formation (Stingl et al., 2001Stingl J. Eaves C.J. Zandieh I. Emerman J.T. Characterization of bipotent mammary epithelial progenitor cells in normal adult human breast tissue.Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2001; 67: 93-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) assays to assess breast progenitor activity, and we evaluated whether they arose from luminal-committed, basal/ME-committed, or bipotent progenitors by staining for the differentiation markers CK14 and CK8/18. We found no significant differences in the formation of primary mammospheres, suggesting that the total number of stem/progenitor cells may not differ between BRCA1+/+ and BRCA1mut/+ tissues (Figure S3). In addition, there was no significant difference in the distribution of CK8/18+ and CK14+ cells within both BRCA1+/+ and BRCA1mut/+ mammospheres (Figure S3). Under adherent conditions, we found that human breast epithelial cells generated spherical colonies that grew in suspension as well as adherent colonies that grew on plastic (Figure 3E; Figures S3). Although we did not observe a statistically significant difference in the number of adherent progenitor colonies arising from BRCA1mut/+ cells, we did observe that spherical luminal colonies derived from BRCA1mut/+ cells expressed significantly higher levels of the basal maker CK14 in comparison to colonies from BRCA1+/+ cells that were more uniformly CK8/18 positive (Figure 3E). We also assessed the in vivo outgrowth competency of progenitor cells from BRCA1mut/+ and BRCA1+/+ cells. By using the humanized cleared fat pad system, we found that BRCA1+/+ cells generated mature bilayered ductal/acinar outgrowths, which contained an inner luminal layer of epithelial cells that stained predominantly for CK8/18 and 19, and an outer myoepithelial layer that stained for the basal/ME marker CK14 and SMA. In contrast, BRCA1mut/+ cells gave rise primarily to immature ductal/acinar outgrowths that exhibited a significant increase in bipotent luminal cells that expressed both CK19 and CK14 and to a lesser degree CK8/18 and CK14 (Figure 3F; Figure S3). Taken together, these results reveal that luminal progenitor cells from BRCA1mut/+ tissue exhibit defects in full maturation and differentiation and retain features of basal differentiation. We next wanted to determine whether the increased basal differentiation observed after neoplastic transformation of BRCA1mut/+ cells was due to the increased numbers of EpCAM− basal cells or to the increased basal differentiation state of luminal progenitor cells. Accordingly, we enriched for either luminal (EpCAM+) or basal/ME (CD10+) cells (Figure 4A ) prior to lentiviral infection and injection into the mammary fat pad. Each subpopulation was isolated from breast tissues to >90% purity, as gauged by immunofluorescence (Figure 4B). The CD10+ subpopulation was enriched for basal/ME CK14+ cells, but CK14+ cells were depleted from the CD10−/EpCAM+ fraction (Figure 4C). Conversely, CK8/18+ luminal cells were enriched in the CD10−/EpCAM+ fraction compared to the CD10+ and parental unsorted populations (Figure 4C). Basal/ME-enriched (CD10+), luminal/progenitor-enriched (CD10−/EpCAM+), and marker-depleted (CD10−/EpCAM−) cells were infected with the p53R175H, CCND1, PI3KCA, and RasG12V oncogenes and injected into humanized murine mammary glands. The luminal-enriched CD10−/EpCAM+ fraction consistently formed tumors with growth kinetics, frequencies, and histopathology similar to tumors arising from unsorted cells from either BRCA1mut/+- or BRCA1+/+-derived tissues (Figures 4D and 4E). Thus, basal/ME (CD10+) or depleted (CD10−/EpCAM−) cells from either BRCA1mut/+ or BRCA1+/+ breast epithelial cell populations were not preferentially transformed with this combination of oncogenes. Rather, these results indicate that the target cell for transformation probably resides within the luminal EpCAM+/CD10− population. Collectively, these results imply that the increased basal phenotype of BRCA1-associated tumors results from the pre-existing increased basal differentiation state of the luminal progenitor population. To investigate the mechanism by which BRCA1 mutation affects progenitor cell differentiation, we classified the breast epithelial gene-expression signature described above based on signaling pathways that were differentially expressed in BRCA1mut/+ cells. Remarkably, the most significantly represented signaling pathways identified in BRCA1mut/+ breast epithelial signature were the Wnt, Notch, and melanogenesis pathways (Figure S4). Notably, the transcriptional repressor Slug, which is an established regulator of melanocyte development, is a downstream target of both Wnt and Notch signaling (Niessen et al., 2008Niessen K. Fu Y. Chang L. Hoodless P.A. McFadden D. Karsan A. Slug is a direct Notch target required for initiation of cardiac cushion cellularization.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, DiMeo et al., 2009DiMeo T.A. Anderson K. Phadke P. Feng C. Perou C.M. Naber S. Kuperwasser C. A novel lung metastasis signature links Wnt signaling with cancer cell self-renewal and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in basal-like breast cancer.Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 5364-5373Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). This connection prompted us to examine Slug expression in breast epithelial tissues and cells harboring mutations in BRCA1. We did not find differences in SLUG mRNA expression, consistent with the microarray data, but we did observe abundant Slug protein in 87% of disease-free BRCA1mut/+ prophylactic mastectomy tissues, while its expression was reduced in tissues from reduction mammoplasty BRCA1+/+ tissues (Allred score > 1, p < 0.01) (Figure 5A ). Because Slug is a transcriptional repressor, we next investigated whether Slug expression might be affecting breast progenitor lineage commitment and differentiation. Because serum addition can promote cellular differentiation of immortalized human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs), which are a model for bipotent breast progenitor cells (Keller et al., 2010Keller P.J. Lin A.F. Arendt L.M. Klebba I. Jones A.D. Rudnick J.A. Dimeo T.A. Gilmore H. Jefferson D.M.

USA. 2010; 107: 14146-14151Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we treated HMECs from patient-derived BRCA1+/+ and BRCA1mut/+ tissues with serum and assessed epithelial differentiation. Treatment of BRCA1+/+ HMECs with serum resulted in luminal differentiation, as measured by an increase EpCAM+/CD24+ cells as well as increased CD24 expression and increased CK8/18 expression (Figure 5B, data not shown). However, addition of serum to BRCA1mut/+ HMEC cells failed to induce complete differentiation, consistent with defects in luminal lineage competency (Figures 5B and 5C). Luminal differentiation was accompanied by a reduction in Slug protein level in both BRCA1mut/+ and BRCA1+/+ cells, although the overall reduction was somewhat reduced in BRCA1mut/+ cells (Figure 5C). To investigate whether Slug directly represses breast epithelial lineage commitment and differentiation, we used lentiviral-mediated short hairpin inhibition of Slug expression in primary prophylactic mastectomy cells isolated from three different patients with deleterious BRCA1 mutations. Slug knockdown led to a reduction in the proportion of EpCAM−/CD49f+ progenitor cells and a concomitant increase in the proportion of EpCAM+, CD44lo, and CD24+ luminal cells (Figure 5D; Figure S5). Furthermore, expression of the basal marker vimentin was greatly reduced, while expression of the luminal marker CD24 was increased (Figure 5C; Figure S5). We also examined the effects of Slug inhibition in immortalized HMECs derived from BRCA1mut/+ patients. As with primary cells, inhibition of Slug resulted in a decrease in the numbers of EpCAM−/CD49f+ basal progenitor cells and an increase in the numbers of EpCAM+ luminal cells (Figure 5E). Given these findings, we also examined whether inhibition of Slug might also affect luminal differentiation in BRCA1+/+ cells. Indeed, inhibition of Slug in BRCA1+/+ cells also led to a reduction in the proportion of EpCAM−/CD49f+ basal progenitor cells and an increase in luminal cells. Taken together, these findings indicate that Slug is a regulator of human breast progenitor cell lineage commitment and that its expression suppresses luminal differentiation. To examine whether BRCA1 regulates Slug expression, we used short interfering RNAs (siRNA) to inhibit BRCA1 expression in human breast MCF10A cells, which express wild-type BRCA1 (Elstrodt et al., 2006Elstrodt F. Hollestelle A. Nagel J.H. Gorin M. Wasielewski M. van den Ouweland A. Merajver S.D. Ethier S.P. Schutte M.

This phenotype is part of a regenerative response, but can lead to hyperproliferation and epithelial degeneration in the aging animal. Here we show that Nrf2, a master regulator of the cellular redox state, specifically controls the proliferative activity of ISCs, promoting intestinal homeostasis. We find that Nrf2 is constitutively active in ISCs and that repression of Nrf2 by its negative regulator Keap1 is required for ISC proliferation. We further show that Nrf2 and Keap1 exert this function in ISCs by regulating the intracellular redox balance. Accordingly, loss of Nrf2 in ISCs causes accumulation of reactive oxygen species and accelerates age-related degeneration of the intestinal epithelium. Our findings establish Keap1 and Nrf2 as a critical redox management system that regulates stem cell function in high-turnover tissues."

This is particularly relevant to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections in which the immune system fails to clear virus and eventually succumbs to uncontrolled viral turnover (Day et al., 2006Day C.L. Kaufmann D.E. Kiepiela P. Brown J.A. Moodley E.S. Reddy S. Mackey E.W. Miller J.D. Leslie A.J.

Hill A. T cells and viral persistence: lessons from diverse infections.Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 873-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Understanding the mechanisms that circumvent immune responses in cases of overwhelming viral replication and antigen expression underlies any rational attempt to augment immunity in HIV infection. Lymphocytic chorimeningitis virus (LCMV) variant clone 13 establishes a chronic infection in mice with high viral turnover, hence mimicking the massive viral antigen levels associated with HIV infection in humans (Wherry et al., 2003Wherry E.J. Blattman J.N. Murali-Krishna K. van der Most R. Ahmed R. Viral persistence alters CD8 T-cell immunodominance and tissue distribution and results in distinct stages of functional impairment.J. Virol. 2003; 77: 4911-4927Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). Clone 13 infection has served as a powerful tool in characterizing the dysfunctional immune response associated with chronic viremia, and numerous parallels with HIV, HCV, and HBV infection have been described (reviewed in Wilson and Brooks, 2010Wilson E.B. Brooks D.G. Translating insights from persistent LCMV infection into anti-HIV immunity.Immunol. Res. 2010; 48: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In contrast to clone 13, LCMV Armstrong causes an acute infection in C57Bl/6 mice, and the immune response differs significantly from clone 13 infection both in magnitude and also in the specificity of the responding immunodominant CD8 T cell clones (Wherry et al., 2003Wherry E.J. Blattman J.N. Murali-Krishna K. van der Most R. Ahmed R. Viral persistence alters CD8 T-cell immunodominance and tissue distribution and results in distinct stages of functional impairment.J. Virol. 2003; 77: 4911-4927Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). In Armstrong infection, the most prominent and highest-affinity CD8 T cell response is directed against the dominant nucleoprotein NP396 epitope, followed by the glycopeptide GP33 epitope and then by GP276. Clone 13 infection is characterized by a deletion of the high-affinity NP396 clones and potentially a functional defect in the remaining LCMV-specific T cells clones (Wherry et al., 2003Wherry E.J. Blattman J.N. Murali-Krishna K. van der Most R. Ahmed R. Viral persistence alters CD8 T-cell immunodominance and tissue distribution and results in distinct stages of functional impairment.J. Virol. 2003; 77: 4911-4927Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). Similar phenotypic and functional disturbances have been described in T cells of HIV-infected humans (Day et al., 2006Day C.L.

We hypothesized that nonredundant cytokines involved in homeostatic proliferation, and therefore apt at overcoming inhibitory networks that naturally limit expansion, would offer the most promise in promoting immune responses. IL-7 is unique for its critical and nonredundant role in immune development and homeostasis and therefore is a prime candidate for use as an immunotherapeutic to overcome immune inhibitory networks in chronic active infections. Indeed, IL-7 offers significant therapeutic promise (Levy et al., 2009Levy Y. Lacabaratz C. Weiss L. Viard J.P. Goujard C. Lelièvre J.D. Boué F. Molina J.M. Rouzioux C.

IL-7 stimulates T cell renewal without increasing viral replication in simian immunodeficiency virus-infected macaques.J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 4447-4453Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, the efficacy of IL-7 in promoting viral clearance has not been fully explored. Importantly, the ability of IL-7 to antagonize immune inhibitory networks and the mechanism underlying its immune modulatory actions remains an area of active investigation. Such knowledge holds the potential to illuminate points for rational therapeutic intervention. In this study, administration of recombinant human IL-7 to mice that are chronically infected with clone 13 increased the magnitude of the immune response with rescue of the NP396-specific T cell clones. It increased the size of the naive T cell pool, including T cell clones directed against non-LCMV specific epitopes, in part by increasing thymic output. LCMV clone 13-specific T cells showed enhanced degranulation kinetics and cytokine production with IL-7 therapy, resulting in effective viral clearance and a downregulation of PD-1 on effector T cells. In addition, IL-7 promoted a cytokine milieu favoring immune activation and production of the cytoprotective cytokine IL-22, thus limiting hepatotoxicity. At the molecular level, IL-7 downregulated suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (Socs3) expression in T cells. This was mediated by suppression of FoxO transcription factors. We show that conditional deficiency of Socs3 in T cells replicates aspects of the IL-7-induced phenotype in mice that are infected with LCMV clone 13. These findings have major implications for our understanding of chronic viremia and the therapeutic use of IL-7. Clone 13-infected mice were treated with IL-7 or PBS commencing 8 days after infection, when chronicity had been established. After 3 weeks of IL-7 therapy, the total number of splenic CD8 and CD4 T cells was increased 11- and 5-fold, respectively, compared to PBS control animals (Figure 1A ). IL-7 treatment did not alter the number of granulocytes, macrophages, or dendritic cells (DCs) compared to controls. A dramatic 10- to 25-fold increase in virus-specific CD8 T cells recognizing GP276 and GP33, respectively, was observed in IL-7-treated mice compared to controls (Figure 1B). An equally robust 10-fold increase in NP396-specific T cells, which represented a very small proportion of virus-specific cells in control animals, was also observed (Figure 1B). The increase in splenic CD8 and CD4 T cell numbers and virus-specific T cells tracked with an equivalent increase in liver, kidney, brain, and lung infiltration by lymphocytes and virus-specific T cells (Figures 1C and 1D and data not shown). Therefore, IL-7 is able to expand and rescue T cell numbers, including CD8 T cell clones that are normally deleted in clone 13 infection, resulting in efficient lymphocyte infiltration into infected organs. To verify that the large increase in clone 13-specific T cells in IL-7-treated animals translated to a functional gain, we examined their ex vivo capacity to degranulate and produce cytokines. We observed a 2-fold increase in the proportion of clone 13-specific CD8 T cells in IL-7-treated animals at day 29 postinfection that were able to produce cytokines and degranulate in restimulation assays compared to controls (Figure 2A ). This translates to a massive 30- to 50-fold increase in the number of functional GP33-specific splenic CD8 T cells in IL-7-treated animals compared to controls (Figure 2A). Similarly, the proportion of clone 13-specific CD4 T cells recognizing GP61 that produce both IFNγ and IL-2 was 4-fold higher in IL-7-treated animals compared to controls (Figure 2B). This translates to a 20-fold increase in the absolute number of functional CD4 T cells recognizing GP61 in the spleens of IL-7-treated animals (Figure 2B). These results highlight the potent effects of IL-7 treatment on the total number of functional CD8 and CD4 virus-specific T cells in a model of chronic infection. Recently, high PD-1 levels on T cells from clone 13-infected animals have been shown to correlate with a dysfunctional phenotype (Barber et al., 2006Barber D.L. Wherry E.J. Masopust D. Zhu B. Allison J.P. Sharpe A.H. Freeman G.J. Ahmed R. Restoring function in exhausted CD8 T cells during chronic viral infection.Nature. 2006; 439: 682-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2746) Google Scholar). We thus examined the level of PD-1 expression on both CD8 and CD4 T cells from IL-7- and PBS-treated animals and observed lower levels of PD-1 on both CD8 and CD4 T cells expressing this receptor, and hence activated by antigen, in IL-7-treated animals compared to controls (Figures 2C and 2D). Furthermore, an acute activation marker, CD69, was downregulated on PD-1-expressing T cells from IL-7-treated animals (Figures 2C and 2D). Collectively, these data indicate that clone 13-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells in IL-7-treated mice begin to lose their activation phenotype by day 29 after 3 weeks of therapy, most likely due to viral clearance. Indeed, IL-7 treatment facilitated viral clearance from spleen and liver by days 22–29 postinfection and resulted in elimination of virus from chronic reservoirs, including brain, lung, and kidney between days 36 and day 60 (Figure 2E). Control animals were not able to clear virus by the end of follow-up at day 60, consistent with previous reports that have demonstrated long-term chronicity in clone 13-infected mice (Wherry et al., 2003Wherry E.J. Blattman J.N. Murali-Krishna K. van der Most R. Ahmed R. Viral persistence alters CD8 T-cell immunodominance and tissue distribution and results in distinct stages of functional impairment.J. Virol. 2003; 77: 4911-4927Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). In addition to the expansion of activated T cells, IL-7 caused an increase in B cell numbers in infected mice. However, proportionally, T cells represented the largest increase in lymphocyte numbers (Figure S1 available online and Figure 1A). To determine which of the expanded lymphocyte populations may contribute to enhanced clearance of virus, we depleted the various subsets during the course of IL-7 therapy to maintain CD4 or CD8 T cell numbers at the same level as PBS clone 13-infected control mice (data not shown). Depletion of either CD4 or CD8 T cells abrogated IL-7's ability to clear virus (Figure S2).Figure S2Effect of Cell Depletion on Viral Titers, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Efficiency of B cell depletion in clone 13 infected animals treated with IL-7.

Viral titers were determined in the indicated organs, at day 30 post infection, in IL-7 or PBS treated clone 13 infected mice that were depleted of CD4, CD8 or B cells. Dotted lines represent the reliable limit of detection for viral plaque assay. Similarly, we depleted B cells with an anti-CD20 mAb (Uchida et al., 2004Uchida J. Hamaguchi Y. Oliver J.A. Ravetch J.V. Poe J.C. Haas K.M. Tedder T.F. The innate mononuclear phagocyte network depletes B lymphocytes through Fc receptor-dependent mechanisms during anti-CD20 antibody immunotherapy.J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 1659-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar) during the course of IL-7 treatment (Figure S2A). Despite this depletion of B cells, the effects of IL-7 on viral clearance were not diminished (Figure S2B). This is consistent with previous studies showing that B cells play only minor roles in modulating T cell responses in cases in which there is abundant antigen (Bouaziz et al., 2007Bouaziz J.D. Yanaba K. Venturi G.M. Wang Y. Tisch R.M. Poe J.C. Tedder T.F. Therapeutic B cell depletion impairs adaptive and autoreactive CD4+ T cell activation in mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 20878-20883Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Our data clearly demonstrate that IL-7 exerts its effect on viral clearance through the modulation of T cells rather than B cells. This has important implications in translating IL-7 therapies to humans, as this cytokine does not expand B cells in humans (Rosenberg et al., 2006Rosenberg S.A. Sportès C. Ahmadzadeh M. Fry T.J. Ngo L.T. Schwarz S.L. Stetler-Stevenson M. Morton K.E. Mavroukakis S.A. Morre M. et al.IL-7 administration to humans leads to expansion of CD8+ and CD4+ cells but a relative decrease of CD4+ T-regulatory cells.J. Immunother. 2006; 29: 313-319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We observed that the majority of splenic CD8 T cells in clone 13-infected mice treated with IL-7 or PBS expressed high levels of CD44 (Figure 3A and data not shown). We speculated that only a fraction of these cells were actually LCMV specific, and the remainder were non-LCMV-specific naive T cells that were upregulating CD44 in response to the inflammatory environment. This was supported, in the case of IL-7-treated animals, by the fact that only 15% of the expanded CD8 T cell population, most of which are CD44hi (data not shown) also expressed PD-1, which represents an antigen-driven activation marker (Figure 3B). To examine this further, we purified, phenotyped, and quantified CD8 T cells recognizing non-LCMV-specific epitopes directed against the SV40 large T antigen and the ovalbumin-derived SIINFEKL epitope (using pooled SV40/ova tetramers). These cells were expanded more than 14-fold in IL-7-treated animals compared to controls, and in both cases, although to a greater extent with IL-7 treatment, the levels of CD44 were upregulated on these cells following clone 13 infection (Figure 3C). Consistent with the fact that these cells were not activated by TCR triggering, as opposed to GP33 virus-specific T cells, there was minimal or no upregulation of PD-1 expression, hence indicating their naive origins (Figure 3C). Collectively, these data support the view that, in addition to expanding the number of activated virus-specific CD8 T cells, IL-7 also greatly expands the naive T cell pool, including T cells recognizing nonviral-related epitopes in chronically infected mice. A similar finding has been reported with the use of IL-7 in uninfected humans (Sportès et al., 2008Sportès C. Hakim F.T. Memon S.A. Zhang H. Chua K.S. Brown M.R. Fleisher T.A. Krumlauf M.C. Babb R.R. Chow C.K. et al.Administration of rhIL-7 in humans increases in vivo TCR repertoire diversity by preferential expansion of naive T cell subsets.J. Exp. Med. 2008; 205: 1701-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), but our data show that these effects are eminently translatable to chronic viral infections. These findings have important implications for the use of IL-7 in HIV-infected patients in which T cells of many different specificities unrelated to HIV also succumb to the disease (Li et al., 2005Li Q. Duan L. Estes J.D. Ma Z.M. Rourke T. Wang Y. Reilly C. Carlis J. Miller C.J. Haase A.T. Peak SIV replication in resting memory CD4+ T cells depletes gut lamina propria CD4+ T cells.Nature. 2005; 434: 1148-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar, Mattapallil et al., 2005Mattapallil J.J. Douek D.C. Hill B. Nishimura Y. Martin M. Roederer M. Massive infection and loss of memory CD4+ T cells in multiple tissues during acute SIV infection.Nature. 2005; 434: 1093-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). It is unlikely that the expansion of naive T cells contributes significantly to the clearance of virus in our model, as IL-7 is administered at the peak of immune activation, and its predominant effect is expansion of activated LCMV-specific T cells (Figure 3B). The expanded naive T cell pool that we observed with IL-7 therapy may be a result of increased thymic output and/or peripheral expansion. IL-7 is thought to mobilize recent thymic emigrants from lymphoid tissues and promote thymic egress (Chu et al., 2004Chu Y.W. Memon S.A. Sharrow S.O. Hakim F.T. Eckhaus M. Lucas P.J. Gress R.E. Exogenous IL-7 increases recent thymic emigrants in peripheral lymphoid tissue without enhanced thymic function.Blood. 2004; 104: 1110-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, Sportès et al., 2008Sportès C. Hakim F.T. Memon S.A. Zhang H. Chua K.S. Brown M.R. Fleisher T.A. Krumlauf M.C. Babb R.R.

Med. 2008; 205: 1701-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). However, there is no detailed analysis of thymic and peripheral effects on recent thymic emigrants in the setting of chronic viral infection. To address this issue, we utilized Rag-GFP transgenic mice, which express green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the rag2 gene locus (Yannoutsos et al., 2001Yannoutsos N. Wilson P. Yu W. Chen H.T. Nussenzweig A. Petrie H. Nussenzweig M.C. The role of recombination activating gene (RAG) reinduction in thymocyte development in vivo.J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, Yu et al., 1999Yu W. Nagaoka H. Jankovic M. Misulovin Z. Suh H. Rolink A. Melchers F. Meffre E. Nussenzweig M.C. Continued RAG expression in late stages of B cell development and no apparent re-induction after immunization.Nature. 1999; 400: 682-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Single positive cells in the thymus and those recently exiting the thymus silence the rag gene locus, so GFP levels slowly decline with time and with each division. We analyzed thymic subsets in clone 13-infected mice and found that, although the number of double-negative thymocytes did not increase with IL-7 treatment, the number of both CD8 and CD4 single positive thymocytes that were GFP bright increased ∼3-fold (Figure 4A ). These GFP bright cells are most likely in situ derived thymic cells rather than peripherally expanded recirculating cells, as the latter should be GFP negative or dull. Notably, these GFP+ cells have lower levels of GFP than cells in the thymus of naive uninfected controls and likely represent cells undergoing local thymic cycling and expansion promoted by IL-7. Therefore, the increase in GFP bright CD8 and CD4 single positive thymocytes may reflect a simple local thymic proliferation of newly generated CD8 and CD4 thymocytes. However, it may also be possible that enhanced thymopoiesis with de novo production of new single positive cells may contribute to the increased number of these cells in the thymus. Among the peripheral T cell population, in both uninfected and clone 13-infected animals, IL-7 increased the number of CD4 and CD8 single positive recent thymic emigrants by 3- to 6-fold, respectively (Figures 4B and 4C). These GFP+ cells were CD44loPD-1lo, indicating that they were truly naive and recent emigrants to the periphery (Figure 4C). These data show that IL-7 therapy in the setting of chronic infection can substantially expand the peripheral T cell pool both through mechanisms of peripheral homeostasis and enhanced thymic output. We investigated the serum cytokine levels associated with the increased numbers of lymphocytes in IL-7-treated clone 13-infected mice. We found that the levels of several proinflammatory cytokines are greatly increased, particularly IL-6, IL-17, and IFNγ in IL-7-treated infected mice (Figure 5A ). However, there was a modest decrease in the levels of TGFβ (Figure 5A). The large increase in IL-17 serum levels likely reflects an expansion of Th17 cells, which may be a consequence of an IL-7-induced shift favoring IL-6 levels over TGFβ and, in turn, favoring Th17 over T regulatory (Treg) cell differentiation (Ogura et al., 2008Ogura H. Murakami M. Okuyama Y. Tsuruoka M. Kitabayashi C. Kanamoto M. Nishihara M. Iwakura Y. Hirano T.

Interestingly, we observed a 2-fold increase in IL-10 serum levels at later time points during IL-7 treatment compared to controls (Figure 5A). Previous work suggests that IL-10 may abrogate immunity to chronic viruses, but in the present study, this inhibitory effect is likely overshadowed by the 17- to 18-fold increase in proinflammatory cytokines (Brooks et al., 2006Brooks D.G. Trifilo M.J. Edelmann K.H. Teyton L. McGavern D.B. Oldstone M.B. Interleukin-10 determines viral clearance or persistence in vivo.Nat.

Resolution of a chronic viral infection after interleukin-10 receptor blockade.J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 2461-2472Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Despite the dramatic increases in proinflammatory cytokines and the heavy infiltration seen in organs of IL-7-treated animals (Figure 1C), we did not observe any significant immune-mediated pathology such as hepatitis (Figure 5B). Collectively, these data show that IL-7 promotes a proinflammatory milieu while limiting cytotoxicity and decreasing the levels of the inhibitory cytokine TGFβ. As a marker of immune-mediated damage and bystander pathology, we examined serum liver enzyme levels. Clone 13 causes a mild hepatitis, with an elevation of both serum aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) 8 days following infection. Compared to controls, IL-7 did not exacerbate liver disease, which resolved quickly in all animals (Figure 5B). IL-6 has been shown to protect hepatocytes from T cell-mediated injury, and this cytokine is significantly upregulated in IL-7-treated animals (Klein et al., 2005Klein C. Wüstefeld T. Assmus U. Roskams T. Rose-John S. Müller M. Manns M.P. Ernst M. Trautwein C. The IL-6-gp130-STAT3 pathway in hepatocytes triggers liver protection in T cell-mediated liver injury.J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 860-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). IL-22 has also been identified as a cytoprotective cytokine that limits hepatotoxicity associated with ConA-induced cytokine storms (Radaeva et al., 2004Radaeva S. Sun R. Pan H.N. Hong F. Gao B. Interleukin 22 (IL-22) plays a protective role in T cell-mediated murine hepatitis: IL-22 is a survival factor for hepatocytes via STAT3 activation.Hepatology. 2004; 39: 1332-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, Zenewicz et al., 2007Zenewicz L.A.

We found a 2-fold increase in serum IL-22 levels in IL-7-treated mice compared to PBS treatment in clone 13-infected animals (Figure 5C). To determine whether the high levels of IL-22 in IL-7-treated clone 13-infected animals was responsible for the lack of significant liver pathology, we utilized anti-IL-22 mAb to neutralize the effect of this cytokine.

https://openalex.org/W2086187832,"Neuroglobin is a highly conserved hemoprotein of uncertain physiological function that evolved from a common ancestor to hemoglobin and myoglobin. It possesses a six-coordinate heme geometry with proximal and distal histidines directly bound to the heme iron, although coordination of the sixth ligand is reversible. We show that deoxygenated human neuroglobin reacts with nitrite to form nitric oxide (NO). This reaction is regulated by redox-sensitive surface thiols, cysteine 55 and 46, which regulate the fraction of the five-coordinated heme, nitrite binding, and NO formation. Replacement of the distal histidine by leucine or glutamine leads to a stable five-coordinated geometry; these neuroglobin mutants reduce nitrite to NO ∼2000 times faster than the wild type, whereas mutation of either Cys-55 or Cys-46 to alanine stabilizes the six-coordinate structure and slows the reaction. Using lentivirus expression systems, we show that the nitrite reductase activity of neuroglobin inhibits cellular respiration via NO binding to cytochrome c oxidase and confirm that the six-to-five-coordinate status of neuroglobin regulates intracellular hypoxic NO-signaling pathways. These studies suggest that neuroglobin may function as a physiological oxidative stress sensor and a post-translationally redox-regulated nitrite reductase that generates NO under six-to-five-coordinate heme pocket control. We hypothesize that the six-coordinate heme globin superfamily may subserve a function as primordial hypoxic and redox-regulated NO-signaling proteins."

Hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) are found in the hair follicle bulge, a distinct area of the outer root sheath that overlies the basement membrane at the lower permanent portion in mammalian hair follicles (Blanpain and Fuchs, 2006Blanpain C.

The HFSC population is composed of multipotent keratinocyte stem cells and is responsible for the cyclic regeneration of hair follicles as well as a transient supply of progeny to the interfollicular epidermis (IFE) and to sebaceous glands after wounding (Blanpain and Fuchs, 2006Blanpain C.

The HFSC population in the bulge area normally supplies a short-term reservoir to the secondary hair germ (subbulge area), which is located just below the bulge area but above the dermal papilla and corresponds to the lowermost portion of resting hair follicles (Figure S1A available online; Greco et al., 2009Greco V.

Melanocyte stem cells (MSCs), which are originally derived from the neural crest, also reside in the follicular bulge-subbulge area (Figure S1A). MSCs supply pigment-producing melanocytes to the hair matrix during each hair cycle to maintain hair pigmentation (Nishimura et al., 2002Nishimura E.K. Jordan S.A. Oshima H. Yoshida H. Osawa M.

Therefore, the bulge-subbulge area houses at least two distinct stem cell populations with different origins. However, it is still unclear to what extent these two different stem cells interact to promote each other's maintenance. Hemidesmosomes are multiprotein adhesion complexes that promote stable epidermal-dermal attachments. The transmembrane protein collagen XVII (COL17A1/BP180/BPAG2) is a structural component of the outer hemidesmosomal plaque, which projects beneath hemidesmosomes in epidermal basal keratinocytes into the underlying basement membrane to mediate anchorage (Masunaga et al., 1997Masunaga T.

Generalized atrophic benign epidermolysis bullosa.Arch. Dermatol. 1982; 118: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) that suggests that COL17A1 plays a role in hair follicle homeostasis. We previously reported premature hair loss in Col17a1-deficient mice (Nishie et al., 2007Nishie W. Sawamura D. Goto M. Ito K. Shibaki A. McMillan J.R. Sakai K. Nakamura H. Olasz E. Yancey K.B. et al.Humanization of autoantigen.Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 378-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), although the precise underlying mechanism is unknown. In this study, we used Col17a1 knockout mice and COL17A1-expressing transgenic mice to show that Col17a1 plays essential roles in the maintenance of HFSCs, which provide a functional niche for MSCs. To understand the role of collagen XVII in hair follicle homeostasis, we performed a careful chronological analysis of Col17a1-deficient mice. As shown in Figure 1A , Col17a1 null mice showed premature hair loss generally preceded by extensive hair graying. Conversely, heterozygous mice displayed a normal phenotype. The hair coats in Col17a1-null mice were indistinguishable from control littermates for 8 weeks after birth. However, progressive hair graying started from the snout at around 12 weeks of age and then became pronounced on their backs at around 4–6 months of age and was associated with a sparser hair distribution that was subsequently followed by progressive and more extensive hair loss (Figure 1A). It is notable that these hair changes were not accompanied or preceded by any apparent changes in the skin. Skin friction, such as attempting to artificially peel neonatal skin, can induce skin erosions in Col17a1-null mice (Nishie et al., 2007Nishie W. Sawamura D. Goto M. Ito K. Shibaki A. McMillan J.R. Sakai K. Nakamura H. Olasz E. Yancey K.B. et al.Humanization of autoantigen.Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 378-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) but did not significantly accelerate hair graying or hair loss. Thus, it is unlikely that the hair changes are a secondary outcome of skin detachment but is more likely that the hair graying and hair loss are programmed through the Col17a1 deficiency in the hair follicles. Our previous studies demonstrated that defective maintenance of MSCs in the hair bulge causes hair graying (Nishimura et al., 2005Nishimura E.K. Granter S.R. Fisher D.E. Mechanisms of hair graying: Incomplete melanocyte stem cell maintenance in the niche.Science. 2005; 307: 720-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Thus, we first examined the distribution and morphology of MSCs in Col17a1-null mice by using a melanocyte-targeted Dct-lacZ transgene (Mackenzie et al., 1997Mackenzie M.A. Jordan S.A. Budd P.S. Jackson I.J. Activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase Kit is required for the proliferation of melanoblasts in the mouse embryo.Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). As shown in Figures 1Ba and 1Bd, Dct-lacZ-expressing cells showed a normal morphology and distribution in the bulge area during hair follicle morphogenesis until initiation of the hair regeneration cycle both in Col17a1+/− and in Col17a1−/− mice. At around 12 weeks after birth, pigmented melanocytes with a dendritic morphology that expressed melanocyte markers appeared in the hair follicle bulge of Col17a1−/− mice (Figure 1Be; Figure S1Be). At 5 months of age, Dct-lacZ-expressing cells were almost completely lost in the follicle bulge area as well as in the hair bulbs of Col17a1-null mice (Figure 1Bf; Figure S1Bf). These data demonstrate that MSC maintenance is defective in Col17a1-deficient mice and that this mechanism results in progressive hair graying. Collagen XVII is a hemidesmosomal transmembrane collagen expressed by basal keratinocytes of the IFE (McGrath et al., 1995McGrath J.A. Gatalica B. Christiano A.M. Li K. Owaribe K. McMillan J.R. Eady R.A. Uitto J. Mutations in the 180-kD bullous pemphigoid antigen (BPAG2), a hemidesmosomal transmembrane collagen (COL17A1), in generalized atrophic benign epidermolysis bullosa.Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). However, neither the expression of mouse Col17a1 nor hemidesmosome assembly in melanocyte lineage cells and/or in bulge keratinocytes has been reported, so we first examined the expression of mouse COL17A1 protein in hair follicles by using immunohistochemistry. As shown in Figure 1Ca and Figures S1C and S1D, mouse COL17A1 was preferentially localized along the dermal-epidermal junction of bulge keratinocytes that express markers for HFSCs but not in follicular keratinocytes outside of the bulge area. However, the localization of COL17A1 in basal cell surface of MSCs could not be determined via normal immunohistochemical methods, because the attachment site of MSCs to the basement membrane is limited (Figure 1Cb). We therefore examined Col17a1 expression by using RT-PCR in flow cytometry-sorted GFP+ cells from melanocyte lineage-tagged GFP transgenic mouse skin (Osawa et al., 2005Osawa M. Egawa G. Mak S.S. Moriyama M. Freter R. Yonetani S. Beermann F. Nishikawa S. Molecular characterization of melanocyte stem cells in their niche.Development. 2005; 132: 5589-5599Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In sharp contrast to the significant expression of Col17a1 in control keratinocytes, expression in GFP+ melanocytes was not detectable (Figure 1D). To support this finding, we used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to check whether Dct-lacZ-expressing melanoblasts within the bulge area in wild-type animals have hemidesmosomes. As shown in Figure 1E, hemidesmosomes, which form regularly spaced electron-dense structures along the epidermal basement membrane zone (McMillan et al., 2003McMillan J.R. Akiyama M. Shimizu H. Epidermal basement membrane zone components: Ultrastructural distribution and molecular interactions.J. Dermatol. Sci. 2003; 31: 169-177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), were completely absent in Dct-lacZ-expressing melanoblasts in the bulge (Figures 1Ed and 1Ef), whereas typical hemidesmosomes were seen overlying the basal plasma membrane in surrounding bulge keratinocytes (Figure 1Ee). Because these bulge keratinocytes adjacent to Dct-lacZ-expressing melanoblasts express HFSC markers (Figure 1F), these data indicate that HFSCs but not MSCs are anchored to the underlying basement membrane via hemidesmosomes. We also confirmed the localization of COL17A1 to hemidesmosomes in basal keratinocytes but not in melanocytes by immunogold electron microscopic analysis of human epidermis (Figure S1E). Therefore, we conclude that MSCs do not express COL17A1 and do not assemble any discernible hemidesmosomal structures at their surface. These findings suggested that the depletion of MSCs in Col17a1-null mice is caused by defects in the HFSC population that forms the main supportive cells surrounding MSCs. Previous studies on wild-type mouse skin reported that mature hemidesmosomes exist at the follicular-dermal junction just below the level of sebaceous glands (Hojiro, 1972Hojiro O. Fine structure of the mouse hair follicle.J. Electron Microsc. (Tokyo). 1972; 21: 127-138PubMed Google Scholar) and in hair germs of telogen hair follicles (Greco et al., 2009Greco V. Chen T. Rendl M. Schober M. Pasolli H.A. Stokes N. Dela Cruz-Racelis J. Fuchs E. A two-step mechanism for stem cell activation during hair regeneration.Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 4: 155-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Consistently, we found mature hemidesmosomes at these junctions within the hair follicle bulge (Figure 1Ee). However, mature hemidesmosomes have not been found in the transient portion of hair follicles (Hojiro, 1972Hojiro O. Fine structure of the mouse hair follicle.J. Electron Microsc. (Tokyo). 1972; 21: 127-138PubMed Google Scholar), where COL17A1 expression is undetectable. These data suggested that hemidesmosome formation is important for anchoring of HFSCs located in the bulge-subbulge area of hair follicles to the basal lamina. To test whether the abnormalities observed in Col17a1 deficiency are specifically caused by any functional defects of HFSCs or by their detachment from the basal lamina, we first carefully examined the junctions of hair follicles in the dorsal skin of Col17a1-null mice and their controls by TEM. A significant number of hemidesmosomes are poorly formed in the bulge keratinocytes of Col17a1-deficient mice (Figure S2B), as seen in epidermal keratinocytes of those mice (Nishie et al., 2007Nishie W. Sawamura D. Goto M. Ito K. Shibaki A. McMillan J.R. Sakai K. Nakamura H. Olasz E. Yancey K.B. et al.Humanization of autoantigen.Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 378-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). However, we did not find any significant microscopic separation at the follicular-dermal junction in sections of trunk skin from Col17a1-null mice (Figure 2; Figures S2A and S2B). Furthermore, we did not find significant inflammatory cell infiltrates or any signs of cell death, such as the appearance of eosinophilic cell bodies or TUNEL-positive or cleaved caspase 3-positive cells, at the follicular-dermal junction area of Col17a1-null mouse skin (Figure S2C and data not shown). Basement membrane thickening/reduplication, a sign of repeated regeneration of the epidermal and dermal junction, was also not found. These findings suggested that the hair graying and hair loss phenotypes in Col17a1-null mice cannot be explained simply by HFSC detachment from the basal lamina but instead may result from dysregulation or altered cell properties of HFSCs caused by Col17a1 deficiency. To examine whether HFSCs show any dysregulation caused by Col17a1 deficiency, we carefully examined the hair follicle cycle progression, which alternates phases of growth (anagen), regression (catagen), and rest (telogen) in synchronization with the activation status of HFSCs, in Col17a1-null mice. While the first short telogen phase was transiently seen around 22 days after birth both in Col17a1-null mice and in control littermates, the second telogen phase was significantly shortened in Col17a1-null mice (Figure 2, summarized on the right side). At 6 weeks of age, just before normal hair follicles on the dorsal skin enter the second telogen phase, most hair follicles in Col17a1−/− mice were not distinguishable from those in Col17a1+/− mice either in morphology or in hair cycle progression. The second telogen phase is normally seen at around 7 weeks after birth and lasts about 4–5 weeks over the entire skin surface of wild-type mice (Paus and Cotsarelis, 1999Paus R. Cotsarelis G. The biology of hair follicles.N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 341: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar, Paus et al., 1999Paus R. Müller-Röver S. Van Der Veen C. Maurer M. Eichmüller S. Ling G. Hofmann U. Foitzik K. Mecklenburg L. Handjiski B. A comprehensive guide for the recognition and classification of distinct stages of hair follicle morphogenesis.J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 113: 523-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). This phase was shortened to less than 2 weeks in all Col17a1−/− mice examined at 8–12 weeks of age, whereas such an aberrant pattern was seen in only 14.3% of Col17a1+/− mice. The subsequent anagen phase was rather prolonged in Col17a1−/− mice compared to their control littermates. These findings suggest that HFSCs are unable to remain quiescent for a sufficient time from the second telogen phase and thereafter in the absence of Col17a1. To search for early events or changes in HFSCs in Col17a1-null mice, we performed immunohistochemical analysis with four different markers for HFSCs, keratin 15 (KRT15), CD34, α6-integrin, and S100A6, at different stages (Figure 3A ; Figure S3; Morris et al., 2004Morris R.J. Liu Y. Marles L. Yang Z. Trempus C. Li S. Lin J.S. Sawicki J.A. Cotsarelis G. Capturing and profiling adult hair follicle stem cells.Nat.

Defining the epithelial stem cell niche in skin.Science. 2004; 303: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (1553) Google Scholar). At 5 weeks of age, there was no difference in the expression of HFSC markers or the number of HFSC marker-positive cells between control and Col17a1-null mice. However, at around 8 weeks of age, HFSC marker-expressing cells were absent in the bulge area in selected null mouse hair follicles (Figures 3A and 3B; Figure S3A), and the number of these marker-deficient follicles increased over time. By 6 months of age, the HFSC population had been lost in most hair follicles of Col17a1-null mice (Figure S3B). Flow cytometric analysis also confirmed that the α6-integrinhigh CD34+ population (Blanpain and Fuchs, 2006Blanpain C. Fuchs E. Epidermal stem cells of the skin.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 22: 339-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar), which represents basal HFSCs in the bulge area, was diminished (Figure 3C). Hair follicle atrophy with the loss of hair follicle structures were also observed once the HFSC population was diminished (Figure 3D). These data indicate that Col17a1-null HFSCs fail to maintain their stem cell characteristics, including their quiescence and immaturity, after the second telogen phase, resulting in hair follicle atrophy. Conversely, epidermal hyperplasia was also transiently found in some focal areas of the Col17a1-null skin at around 6 months of age (Figure 3D, arrowheads) but was normalized and subsequently became atrophic at later stages, which suggests that the epidermal stem cell population might also be gradually losing its self-renewing potential with age in Col17a1 deficiency compared to controls. To examine whether HFSC maintenance fails because the cells lose their immaturity or quiescence in the absence of Col17a1, we analyzed the expression of markers for keratinocyte differentiation and proliferation in Col17a1-null hair follicles. Interestingly, keratin 1 (KRT1), a differentiation marker for the IFE, was ectopically expressed in the bulge area of Col17a1-null mice at 8 weeks of age (Figure 4A ). KRT1-positive cells in the bulge areas of affected hair follicles were found in 60% of Col17a1-null mice but not in control mice at that age. Ectopic expression of other epidermal differentiation markers, such as involucrin and KRT10, was also present in the bulge areas of Col17a1-null mice at 8 weeks of age (Figure S4A). Furthermore, Ki67-positive cells were located in the bulge area of Col17a1-null mice, and those Ki67-positive cells showed an absent or reduced level of KRT15 expression (Figure 4A). The maintenance of quiescence and immaturity of somatic stem cells in tissues is a prerequisite for sustained stem cell self-renewal, and which can be assessed for HFSCs by means of a colony-formation assay in vitro (Barrandon and Green, 1987Barrandon Y. Green H. Three clonal types of keratinocyte with different capacities for multiplication.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1987; 84: 2302-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar, Oshima et al., 2001Oshima H. Rochat A. Kedzia C. Kobayashi K. Barrandon Y. Morphogenesis and renewal of hair follicles from adult multipotent stem cells.Cell. 2001; 104: 233-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). We therefore took advantage of the type of assay by using neonatal epidermal keratinocytes, which contain the presumptive HFSC population (Nowak et al., 2008Nowak J.A. Polak L. Pasolli H.A. Fuchs E. Hair follicle stem cells are specified and function in early skin morphogenesis.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 33-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), to assess the self-renewal potential of that population in Col17a1-null mice. As shown in Figures 4Ba and 4Bb, Col17a1 homozygous null keratinocytes showed defects in colony-forming ability on 3T3-J2 feeder cells compared to keratinocytes from control mice. Colonies larger than 0.5 mm in diameter were significantly decreased in number with Col17a1-null keratinocytes (Figure 4Bc). Although Col17a1-null keratinocytes showed defective binding ability to collagen I-coated dishes (Figure S4B), they showed no detectable defects in their ability to directly adhere to 3T3-J2 feeder cells (Figure 4Bd). These data strongly suggest that Col17a1-null keratinocytes have a much lower renewal capability than control keratinocytes. Taken together with the in vivo findings, we conclude that COL17A1 is critical for the self-renewal of HFSCs by maintaining their immaturity and quiescence. To examine whether the early changes in HFSC in Col17a1 mutant mice affects the maintenance of MSCs in the hair follicle bulge, we carefully examined MSCs in hair follicle bulge areas in Col17a1-null mice beginning to show HFSC defects. At 8 weeks of age, when HFSCs in Col17a1-null mice are prematurely activated, KIT+ melanoblasts within the bulge area prematurely coexpressed TYRP1, a melanocyte differentiation marker, in Col17a1-null mice but not in control mice (Figure S5A). At around 12 weeks of age, pigmented melanocytes with a mature dendritic morphology and expressing TYRP1 in addition to Dct-lacZ and KIT were aberrantly found within the bulge area in mid-anagen hair follicles (Dct-lacZ-expressing cells in Figure 1B, Figure S1B, arrow in Figure 5A ; KIT+/TYRP1+ cells in Figures 5B and 5C and Figure S5B). Conversely, only nonpigmented melanoblasts expressing Dct-lacZ and KIT but not TYRP1 and with small cell bodies (MSCs) were found in control littermates (Figure 1B; Figures S1B and S5B). Similar morphological changes were previously described as ectopic MSC differentiation within the niche (Inomata et al., 2009Inomata K. Aoto T. Binh N.T. Okamoto N. Tanimura S. Wakayama T. Iseki S.

Granter S.R. Fisher D.E. Mechanisms of hair graying: Incomplete melanocyte stem cell maintenance in the niche.Science. 2005; 307: 720-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). These ectopically differentiated melanocytes were found in the bulge area at 12–13 weeks of age, prior to the hair graying seen in Col17a1-null mice (Figure 5D). Furthermore, it is notable that the ectopically differentiated melanocytes in Col17a1-deficient mice were typically found in association with early changes in bulge keratinocytes including the enlarged morphology of surrounding bulge keratinocytes (Figure 5A, arrowheads) and an increased number of Ki67-expressing bulge keratinocytes in midanagen follicles (Figures 4A and 5E and data not shown). The appearance of ectopically differentiated melanocytes within the bulge area was followed by progressive hair graying in Col17a1-null mice (Figures 1A and 1B; Figure S1B). TGF-β signaling is activated in the hair follicle bulge and is involved in but is not essential for the maintenance of HFSCs (Guasch et al., 2007Guasch G. Schober M. Pasolli H.A. Conn E.B. Polak L.

As similar changes in MSCs, such as the appearance of ectopically differentiated melanocytes in the niche and the subsequent depletion of MSCs seen in Col17a1-null mice, were found in TGFbRII conditional knockout mice (Nishimura et al., 2010Nishimura E.K.

https://openalex.org/W2058421656,"Understanding the mechanisms regulating pluripotency in embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells is required to ensure their safe use in clinical applications. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) has emerged as an important regulator of pluripotency, based primarily on studies with small-molecule GSK-3 inhibitors. Here, we use mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) lacking GSK-3 to demonstrate that a single GSK-3 substrate, β-catenin, controls the ability of ESCs to exit the pluripotent state and to differentiate into neurectoderm. Unexpectedly, the effects of β-catenin on pluripotency do not appear to be dependent on TCF-mediated signaling, based on experiments utilizing a β-catenin C-terminal truncation mutant or highly efficient dominant-negative TCF strategies. Alternatively, we find that stabilized β-catenin forms a complex with and enhances the activity of Oct-4, a core component of the transcriptional network regulating pluripotency. Collectively, our data suggest previously underappreciated, divergent TCF-dependent and TCF-independent roles for β-catenin in ESCs."
https://openalex.org/W2109361919,"The human epigenetic cell-cycle regulator HCF-1 undergoes an unusual proteolytic maturation process resulting in stably associated HCF-1(N) and HCF-1(C) subunits that regulate different aspects of the cell cycle. Proteolysis occurs at six centrally located HCF-1(PRO)-repeat sequences and is important for activation of HCF-1(C)-subunit functions in M phase progression. We show here that the HCF-1(PRO) repeat is recognized by O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT), which both O-GlcNAcylates the HCF-1(N) subunit and directly cleaves the HCF-1(PRO) repeat. Replacement of the HCF-1(PRO) repeats by a heterologous proteolytic cleavage signal promotes HCF-1 proteolysis but fails to activate HCF-1(C)-subunit M phase functions. These results reveal an unexpected role of OGT in HCF-1 proteolytic maturation and an unforeseen nexus between OGT-directed O-GlcNAcylation and proteolytic maturation in HCF-1 cell-cycle regulation."

Interestingly, bypass of senescence promotes stem-like proliferation and maintains survival of the keratin 15-positive stem cell population. Furthermore, we identify the chromatin-remodeling protein Lsh as a new target of ΔNp63α that is an essential mediator of senescence bypass.

Therefore, the discovery of the p53 family members p63 and p73 generated much interest that these proteins would also act to prevent cancer. However, with regards to p63, a more complicated picture has emerged. p63 is expressed robustly in stem and progenitor cells within the proliferating basal layer of stratified epithelia such as the skin, breast, and prostate. p63's critical importance in epithelia is highlighted by p63-deficient mouse models. In contrast to the viable and fertile, yet tumor-prone, phenotype of p53-deficient mice (Donehower et al., 1992Donehower L.A. Harvey M. Slagle B.L. McArthur M.J. Montgomery Jr., C.A. Butel J.S.

We previously circumvented this postnatal lethality by generating a p63 conditional mouse model (Mills et al., 2002Mills A.A. Qi Y. Bradley A. Conditional inactivation of p63 by Cre-mediated excision.Genesis. 2002; 32: 138-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and reported that inducible ablation of p63 in primary keratinocytes in culture induces a program of cellular senescence and that ablation of p63 in proliferating cells of the adult epidermis in vivo induces cellular senescence and accelerated aging, establishing that p63 deficiency-mediated cellular senescence is a cause of organismal aging (Keyes et al., 2005Keyes W.M.

Mills A.A. p63 deficiency activates a program of cellular senescence and leads to accelerated aging.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1986-1999Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Despite these advances, the role of p63 in cancer has remained perplexing, in large part because multiple p63 isoforms exist. p63 proteins can be classified into two main groups, each of which is transcribed from distinct promoters: those possessing a full-length transactivation domain analogous to that of p53 (referred to as the TA isoform class) and those lacking this domain (referred to as the ΔN isoform class) (Yang et al., 1998Yang A.

The tumorigenic potential of p63-deficient mice has surprisingly not helped to clarify the role of p63 in cancer, because different groups have reported disparate results (Flores et al., 2005Flores E.R.

USA. 2006; 103: 8435-8440Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In addition, the p63 mouse models used for tumor studies thus far are deficient for all p63 isoforms, and therefore the contribution of individual p63 proteins in cancer may have been masked in these studies. Indeed, it has been suggested that the TA isoforms are most similar to p53, whereas the ΔN isoforms have opposing functions. ΔNp63α is the predominant isoform expressed in stem cells as well as in proliferating basal cells of stratified epithelia (Yang et al., 1998Yang A. Kaghad M. Wang Y. Gillett E. Fleming M.D. Dötsch V. Andrews N.C. Caput D. McKeon F. p63, a p53 homolog at 3q27-29, encodes multiple products with transactivating, death-inducing, and dominant-negative activities.Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 305-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1840) Google Scholar). ΔNp63α is overexpressed in some types of human cancer, particularly squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (Hibi et al., 2000Hibi K. Trink B. Patturajan M. Westra W.H. Caballero O.L. Hill D.E. Ratovitski E.A.

Biol. 2005; 70: 11-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested to have oncogenic functions through inhibition of p53 (Yang et al., 1998Yang A. Kaghad M. Wang Y. Gillett E. Fleming M.D. Dötsch V. Andrews N.C. Caput D. McKeon F. p63, a p53 homolog at 3q27-29, encodes multiple products with transactivating, death-inducing, and dominant-negative activities.Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 305-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1840) Google Scholar). However, in other tumor types, such as adenocarcinoma of the breast and prostate, ΔNp63α expression is lost during the tumorigenic process (Di Como et al., 2002Di Como C.J. Urist M.J. Babayan I. Drobnjak M. Hedvat C.V. Teruya-Feldstein J. Pohar K. Hoos A. Cordon-Cardo C. p63 expression profiles in human normal and tumor tissues.Clin. Cancer Res. 2002; 8: 494-501PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the role of p63 in cancer, and in particular the role of individual p63 isoforms, merits further investigation. Given our previous findings that p63 deficiency induces cellular senescence, we hypothesized that p63 might also be a key modulator of the tumor-suppressive mechanism of oncogene-induced senescence (OIS). We explored the role of p63 in OIS—specifically with activated Ras being the oncogene—with a system that circumvents the previously generated p63-deficient mouse models. Here we demonstrate that the predominant p63 isoform, ΔNp63α, is an oncogene that promotes stem-like proliferation and carcinoma development through induction of the chromatin remodeler Lsh. To investigate a potential role for p63 in OIS, we induced senescence in primary mouse keratinocytes by retroviral infection with oncogenic H-Ras-V12 (hereafter referred to as Ras) and monitored p63 expression. As shown previously, Ras induced features of senescence, including proliferation arrest, a characteristic morphology, and enhanced senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity (Figure 1; Serrano et al., 1997Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W. Oncogenic ras provokes premature cell senescence associated with accumulation of p53 and p16INK4a.Cell. 1997; 88: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3942) Google Scholar). Interestingly, induction of senescence was concomitant with a significant decrease in expression of endogenous ΔNp63α expression at both the transcript and protein level, whereas expression of TAp63 isoforms was not affected (Figure 1A; Figure S1 available online). This demonstrates that the predominant p63 isoform expressed in keratinocytes, ΔNp63α, is depleted during OIS. To determine whether loss of ΔNp63α is a requirement for OIS, primary keratinocytes were coinfected with Ras and expression constructs encoding ΔNp63α, TAp63α, or mutant ΔNp63α (ΔNp63αR279H). The R279H mutation within the DNA binding domain of p63 causes EEC syndrome in humans and corresponds to one of the most prevalent p53 point mutations found in human cancer (Celli et al., 1999Celli J. Duijf P. Hamel B.C. Bamshad M. Kramer B. Smits A.P. Newbury-Ecob R. Hennekam R.C. Van Buggenhout G. van Haeringen A. et al.Heterozygous germline mutations in the p53 homolog p63 are the cause of EEC syndrome.Cell. 1999; 99: 143-153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Whereas expression of ΔNp63α was sufficient to inhibit senescence and induce continued proliferation in Ras-expressing primary keratinocytes, neither TAp63α nor ΔNp63αR279H had this ability (Figures 1B–1D). These data demonstrate that downregulation of ΔNp63α is necessary for OIS and that overexpression of this isoform bypasses senescence. Keratinocytes expressing Ras and ΔNp63α (hereafter referred to as RΔN cells) had a specific cellular phenotype: whereas shortly after infection they failed to senesce and continued to proliferate slowly, approximately 2 weeks after infection, clonal populations of proliferating cells emerged from these cultures. Given that p63 has been proposed as a determinant of epithelial stem cells (Senoo et al., 2007Senoo M. Pinto F. Crum C.P. McKeon F. p63 Is essential for the proliferative potential of stem cells in stratified epithelia.Cell. 2007; 129: 523-536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar), we asked whether the clonally proliferating RΔN cells that had bypassed senescence had characteristics of stem cells. We grew RΔN cells in three-dimensional (3D) culture conditions designed to assay for the self-renewal capability and proliferative potential of stem cells (Figure 2A ; Lawson et al., 2007Lawson D.A. Xin L. Lukacs R.U. Cheng D. Witte O.N. Isolation and functional characterization of murine prostate stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Whereas vector- or Ras-infected cells failed to proliferate in 3D culture, cells infected with ΔNp63α proliferated and formed clusters containing small numbers of cells. In contrast, the clonal RΔN cells that had bypassed senescence proliferated robustly in 3D culture, forming large multicellular spheres. To test whether this sphere-forming capability was a universal feature of cells that had escaped senescence, we inhibited OIS by shRNA-mediated knockdown of p53 in the presence of Ras (referred to as Rshp53 cells) and analyzed for growth in 3D culture. Rshp53 cells proliferated robustly and formed large irregular growths, but were devoid of the sphere-forming ability observed in RΔN cultures (Figure 2A). This suggested that the 3D sphere phenotype of RΔN keratinocytes resulted from a unique cooperation between ΔNp63α and Ras. Immunofluorescent analysis demonstrated that whereas RΔN spheres expressed markers of proliferating keratinocytes such as keratin 14 (K14), indicating that they were relatively undifferentiated, Rshp53 cells expressed significantly lower levels of K14 (Figure 2B). A hallmark feature of stem cells is their ability to self-renew. To assess the self-renewal potential of RΔN 3D cultures, primary spheres were either dissociated and replated directly into the 3D culture (data not shown) or were first expanded as a monolayer and then replated into 3D culture (Figure S2A). In each case, RΔN cells retained their sphere-forming capability, whereas Rshp53 cells did not have this property. This demonstrates that ΔNp63α's ability to bypass senescence endows keratinocytes with intrinsic self-renewal capabilities that are characteristic of stem-like cells. Genes whose expression is elevated in the keratinocyte stem cell populations of mouse skin have been identified (Blanpain et al., 2004Blanpain C. Lowry W.E. Geoghegan A. Polak L. Fuchs E.

Lowry W.E. Rendl M. Fuchs E. Defining the epithelial stem cell niche in skin.Science. 2004; 303: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (1631) Google Scholar). Interestingly, real-time RT-PCR indicated that 3D cultures of RΔN cells expressed elevated levels of a number of stem cell markers relative to Rshp53 cells, including s100a6, Idb2, Notch, and Tcf3 (Figure S3B). By using FACS analysis to identify the CD34/α-6 integrin double-positive stem cells, we found that the RΔN cultures expressed higher levels of the epithelial stem cell markers CD34 and α6-integrin than control cultures (not shown). This demonstrates that ΔNp63α acts in concert with oncogenic Ras to promote proliferation of cells with enhanced expression of stem cell-associated genes. Another key feature of stem cells is their ability to differentiate. We asked whether RΔN cells have this capacity by taking advantage of the ability of primary keratinocytes to terminally differentiate and to withdraw from the cell cycle in the presence of elevated calcium (Dotto, 1999Dotto G.P. Signal transduction pathways controlling the switch between keratinocyte growth and differentiation.Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1999; 10: 442-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Whereas wild-type keratinocytes lose their epithelial phenotype, acquire a differentiated morphology, and lose expression of proliferation markers such as PCNA upon calcium addition, cells transformed by Rshp53 fail to undergo such differentiation, proliferate robustly, and readily form multiple foci (Figure 2C). Remarkably, RΔN keratinocytes were unique: they were similar to wild-type cells with regard to their ability to acquire phenotypic features of terminal differentiation in response to elevated calcium, yet in contrast to wild-type keratinocytes, they did not withdraw from the cell cycle and continued to proliferate. Consistent with these cellular phenotypes, real-time RT-PCR analyses for a panel of markers of epithelial proliferation and differentiation indicates that RΔN cells retain both proliferative and differentiation potential (Figure 2D; Figure S2C). These findings demonstrate that whereas both p53 loss and ΔNp63α overexpression facilitate bypass of the tumor-suppressive mechanism of OIS, ΔNp63α-mediated bypass is unique in that it facilitates proliferation while retaining the capacity to differentiate. The ability of ΔNp63α to enhance stem-like characteristics in the presence of oncogenic Ras could be due to expansion of the normal epithelial stem cell population or alternatively could result from RΔN conferring stem-like properties onto the more differentiated transit-amplifying cell population. To determine whether ΔNp63α was affecting the normal stem cell population, we used two different mouse models that mark two distinct CD34-positive epithelial stem cell populations of the skin in vivo. The first model is the keratin 15 (K15)-GFP mouse, in which the K15 promoter drives GFP expression in stem cells of the hair follicle bulge that can give rise to all epidermal cell types (Morris et al., 2004Morris R.J. Liu Y. Marles L. Yang Z. Trempus C. Li S. Lin J.S. Sawicki J.A. Cotsarelis G. Capturing and profiling adult hair follicle stem cells.Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). The second model is the Nestin-GFP mouse, in which the Nestin promoter drives GFP expression in multipotent CD34-positive, K15-negative stem cells of the hair follicle bulge, which have the capacity to differentiate into multiple epidermal cell types, but also have neural, smooth muscle, and adipogenic capacity (Mignone et al., 2007Mignone J.L. Roig-Lopez J.L. Fedtsova N. Schones D.E. Manganas L.N. Maletic-Savatic M. Keyes W.M. Mills A.A. Gleiberman A. Zhang M.Q. Enikolopov G. Neural potential of a stem cell population in the hair follicle.Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 2161-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In both models, GFP-negative cells include committed, more differentiated transit-amplifying cells. Although both K15- and Nestin-positive stem cell populations are prevalent in the hair follicles of the bulge region, these markers identify distinct stem cell populations in adult skin (Figure 3A ). We evaluated the effect of RΔN on both models by establishing primary keratinocytes from newborn skin from K15-GFP and Nestin-GFP mice and infecting with control vectors or Ras plus ΔNp63α expression constructs. To evaluate whether the GFP or the non-GFP populations were being affected by ΔNp63α, we assessed the percentage of GFP-expressing cells, specifically looking during both senescence bypass and the clonal expansion stage (Figures 3B and 3C). As expected, the control vector did not confer a proliferative advantage to either the K15- or Nestin-marked stem cell pools, and these cells failed to proliferate 7 days after infection, as is typical for primary mouse keratinocyte cultures. In contrast, the K15-positive (but not the Nestin-positive) stem cell population was maintained in proliferating RΔN keratinocytes that had bypassed senescence, even 25 days after infection. These results indicate that ΔNp63α cooperates with oncogenic Ras to maintain the K15-positive stem cell population. Our results demonstrate that expression of ΔNp63α inhibits OIS and promotes proliferation of cells with properties of stem cells. Aberrantly proliferating stem cells, or cells that have acquired stem-like features, have been suggested to be the cell-of-origin for a number of tumor types. Mutations that impair senescence can facilitate malignancy, so we asked whether primary cells infected with RΔN were transformed and tumorigenic in vivo. As positive controls, primary keratinocytes infected with Ras and shRNA-p53-GFP were injected subcutaneously into nude mice. Imaging and analysis of these mice revealed the growth of GFP-positive tumors with the expected high incidence for cells transformed by p53 deficiency in the context of Ras (overall tumor incidence, 17/18 sites, 94%) (Figure 4A ; Table S1). Injection of cells infected with either vector, Ras alone, or ΔNp63α alone did not yield any tumors, in agreement with previous results (Table S1; Missero et al., 1996Missero C. Di Cunto F. Kiyokawa H. Koff A. Dotto G.P. The absence of p21Cip1/WAF alters keratinocyte growth and differentiation and promotes ras-tumor progression.Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3065-3075Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Strikingly, RΔN cells also formed GFP-positive tumors, albeit with a lower overall incidence (12/24 sites, 50%) (Figure 4A; Table S1), indicating that ΔNp63α is an oncogene that induces tumorigenesis in cooperation with oncogenic Ras. Histopathological analyses of tumors that developed in vivo revealed that RΔN expression caused tumors that were histologically distinct from those in which p53 was knocked down, even though the same preparations of cells that had been cultured under identical conditions in parallel were used. Tumors that developed from Rshp53 cells were large, rapidly growing hard masses and presented primarily as fibrosarcoma or poorly differentiated sarcoma, with features of having undergone epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) (Figure 4B; Table S1). In contrast, tumors that developed from RΔN cells were slower growing, often included smaller tumor masses surrounded by necrotic tissue, and presented predominantly as SCC, with some mice developing poorly differentiated sarcoma. Immunohistochemical analyses further demonstrated the distinction between the different tumor types, with the RΔN tumors expressing the epithelial markers K14 and β-catenin, while these epithelial markers were not detectable in Rshp53 tumors (Figure 4B; Figure S3A). Interestingly, N-cadherin, a marker of EMT, was detectable in only a few cells of RΔN tumors, but was expressed robustly throughout Rshp53 tumors (Figure S3A), suggesting that RΔN had not undergone EMT. Furthermore, whereas immunostaining for p53 and p19 showed that p53-deficient tumors had elevated p19 expression, indicating that p53-mediated feedback inhibition of p19 was impaired, RΔN tumors were also deficient for p53, but p19 was not detectable in these tumors (Figure S3B). This further demonstrates the histological and molecular distinction between these tumors. These findings are in agreement with the high incidence and early expression of ΔNp63α in human SCC (Hibi et al., 2000Hibi K. Trink B. Patturajan M. Westra W.H. Caballero O.L. Hill D.E. Ratovitski E.A. Jen J. Sidransky D. AIS is an oncogene amplified in squamous cell carcinoma.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 5462-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), demonstrating that ΔNp63α is an oncogene capable of causing tumor development in a manner distinct from deficiency of p53. To extend our findings that p63 depletion is a prerequisite for OIS, we monitored expression of endogenous p63 in vivo in a model of OIS bypass-induced carcinogenesis. Topical treatment of mouse skin with DMBA induces Ras mutations, which facilitate development of premalignant papillomas with markers and features of OIS; inactivation of mediators of OIS facilitates senescence bypass and converts preneoplastic lesions to malignant SCC (Collado et al., 2005Collado M. Gil J. Efeyan A. Guerra C. Schuhmacher A.J. Barradas M. Benguría A. Zaballos A. Flores J.M. Barbacid M. et al.Tumour biology: Senescence in premalignant tumours.Nature. 2005; 436: 642Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar). We examined skin sections from DMBA-induced papillomas and SCC for expression of p63 and markers of senescence. p63 was detectable in premalignant lesions, as previously shown (Keyes et al., 2006Keyes W.M. Vogel H. Koster M.I. Guo X. Qi Y. Petherbridge K.M. Roop D.R. Bradley A. Mills A.A. p63 heterozygous mutant mice are not prone to spontaneous or chemically induced tumors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 8435-8440Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), but notably was most robust in the proliferating basal layer, with expression decreasing in suprabasal layers (Figure 5), analogous to the graded pattern of p63 observed in normal skin. This contrasts markedly with p63 expression in SCC, which is abundant in transformed cells that escaped senescence and progressed to malignancy (Figure 5A). To examine whether the decrease in p63 expression in the premalignant lesions correlated with cells that had undergone OIS, tissues were costained for p63 as well as for markers of proliferation and senescence (Figure 5B). Whereas expression of p63 overlapped with the proliferation marker Ki67, it did not overlap with the senescence markers γH2AX and p19. This indicates that OIS in vivo occurs in p63-depleted cells, whereas cells that bypass senescence and develop into tumors express p63 robustly. The finding that the patterns of expression of p63 and markers of senescence are mutually exclusive in vivo confirms and extends our findings that downregulation of endogenous ΔNp63α is required for OIS. To elucidate the mechanism by which ΔNp63α inhibits OIS, we examined primary keratinocytes that had been infected with RΔN or control vectors shortly after infection (see schematic, Figure 6A ). This time point precedes the development of distinct cellular phenotypes and was chosen because we wanted to identify ΔNp63α-modulated pathways that initiated senescence bypass and led to stem-like proliferation and tumorigenesis. We examined expression of known senescence mediators at the transcript and protein level in RΔN cells; however, p53, p16, p19, p21, and PML were not reduced during the initial stages of senescence bypass (Figures 6B; Figure S4A). These analyses not only indicate that the initiating events by which ΔNp63α inhibits senescence probably do not occur via these pathways, but it also suggests that additional as yet uncharacterized senescence pathways are modulated by ΔNp63α. To identify genes whose expression was altered by ΔNp63α expression and hence might reveal novel ΔNp63α-mediated pathways facilitating senescence bypass, we performed cDNA microarray analyses on primary keratinocytes at an early stage after infection with RΔN and controls. This led to the identification of 26 genes whose expression was either increased (23 genes) or decreased (3 genes) in RΔN cells relative to controls (Figure S4B). Real-time RT-PCR confirmed that expression of a number of these genes was altered in RΔN cells, indicating that these genes are induced during the initial phase of senescence bypass. To determine whether any of the candidate genes were direct targets of ΔNp63α, we analyzed the regions upstream of the transcriptional start sites for p53/p63 consensus binding sites. We identified a p63-consensus binding site in the mouse Lsh (lymphoid-specific helicase) gene (Figure S5A), which encodes a member of the SNF2 family of chromatin remodeling proteins. Like p63, Lsh has been implicated in both embryonic development and cellular senescence (Geiman et al., 2001Geiman T.M. Tessarollo L. Anver M.R. Kopp J.B. Ward J.M. Muegge K. Lsh, a SNF2 family member, is required for normal murine development.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1526: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Analysis of the human LSH promoter identified putative p63 consensus binding sites similar to those described previously (Figure S5B; Yang et al., 2006Yang A. Zhu Z. Kapranov P. McKeon F. Church G.M.

Cell. 2006; 24: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). To determine whether p63 binds the Lsh promoter, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) in RΔN cells with an antibody specific for p63. Primers for p21, a previously identified ΔNp63α target gene, were used as a positive control (Figure 6C). By using multiple primer pairs flanking the p63 consensus binding site identified in Lsh, we found that p63 bound this region, whereas under similar conditions, we did not detect binding to the promoter region of two other genes (Figure 6C; Figure S5C). The p63 antibody used for ChIP was raised against a peptide common to each of the six p63 isoforms (Yang et al., 1998Yang A. Kaghad M. Wang Y. Gillett E. Fleming M.D. Dötsch V. Andrews N.C. Caput D.

Further, in animal cells, recent studies implicate the geometry of cell-matrix adhesions as a key determinant of cleavage-plane orientation (Théry et al., 2005Théry M. Racine V. Pépin A. Piel M.

Experimental and theoretical study of mitotic spindle orientation.Nature. 2007; 447: 493-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Cell geometry is thus a critical determinant of cleavage-plane orientation, at both the molecular and biophysical levels. Whereas the regulation of mitotic cleavage-plane orientation by geometric cues has been extensively probed in unicellular systems, far less attention has been given to adherent epithelial and epidermal layers. In this context, cell geometry does not exist in isolation because cell shapes emerge from the combined effects of growth, mitosis, and cellular packing. A priori, this complex interplay of biological processes, and the diverse genetic programs that have evolved to control them in plants and animals, would appear to suggest a staggering range of possible cell geometries within an epithelium. However, spatial considerations impose powerful constraints on the shapes of cells in monolayer sheets, from the distribution of polygonal cell types (Rivier et al., 1995Rivier N. Schliecker G. Dubertret B. The stationary state of epithelia.Acta Biotheor. 1995; 43: 403-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) to their neighbor correlations (Peshkin et al., 1991Peshkin M.A. Strandburg K.J.

Lissowski A. On the correlation between sizes and shapes of cells in epithelial mosaics.J. Phys. Math. Gen. 1982; 15: L143-L148Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Indeed, empirical investigation confirms that many monolayer cell sheets across the plant and animal kingdoms converge on a default equilibrium distribution of cellular shapes, with approximately 45% hexagons, 25% pentagons, and 20% heptagons (Gibson et al., 2006Gibson M.C.

Such clear conservation of cellular network architecture raises the question as to whether conserved cellular division mechanisms are responsible for generating such similar packing arrangements of cells, as numerous studies have proposed (Dubertret et al., 1998Dubertret B.

Modeling and inferring cleavage patterns in proliferating epithelia.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2009; 5: e1000412Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The strongest evidence to date that common mechanisms are used among plants and animals to generate conserved packing relationships can be found in the mitotic shift, wherein the distribution of mitotic cell shapes is shifted by a single polygon class to have a heptagonal mean, as opposed to a hexagonal mean as seen in interphase cells. Here, we use computational modeling, experimental observation, and mathematical analysis to report that, as a default property, neighbor cell shape can strongly bias cleavage-plane orientation in the monolayer cell sheets of both plants and animals. Intriguingly, we show that this bias increases the structural regularity of an epithelium by increasing the frequency of hexagons. Our analysis indicates that simultaneously, cleavage-plane bias is also involved in specifying the mitotic shift. The mechanism through which cleavage-plane bias accomplishes these effects is differential side-gaining, whereby dividing cells preferentially cleave their common interfaces with subhexagonal cells such as quadrilaterals and avoid cleaving their common interfaces with superhexagonal cells such as octagons. Together, our results suggest a common emergent mechanism in plants and animals for the control of tissue-level architecture by packing-mediated control of the mitotic cleavage plane. In epithelia, the tissue-level architecture at the apical junctions is a contiguous tiling of polygonal cell shapes (Figures 1A and 1B ). This pattern can be described as a simple planar network wherein a cell's number of neighbors (topology) is equivalent to its polygon class (Figure 1B′). To investigate the effect of polygonal cell packing on mitotic cell shape, and by extension, cleavage-plane orientation, we tested whether a cell's long axis is systematically influenced by the polygon class of neighboring cells. To address this, we numerically solved for the minimal energy configuration of a local cellular neighborhood (Prusinkiewicz and Lindenmayer, 1990Prusinkiewicz P. Lindenmayer A. The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants. Springer-Verlag, New York1990Crossref Google Scholar), defined to be a central mitotic cell (M) and its first-order polygonal neighbors. Geometrically, cells were idealized as polygonal prisms with constant height (Figure 1A). For relaxation, cell mechanics were modeled in terms of a balance between edge-length tensions, described using ideal springs, and internal pressure, modeled as an ideal gas (Figure 1C). The central mitotic cell, M, was a heptagon, consistent with the fact that the average mitotic cell is seven-sided in vivo (Aegerter-Wilmsen et al., 2010Aegerter-Wilmsen T. Smith A.C. Christen A.J.

Perrimon N. The emergence of geometric order in proliferating metazoan epithelia.Nature. 2006; 442: 1038-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Parameters were chosen to be uniform for every cell, and initial conditions were arbitrary (Figures 1D–1F). Given these choices, the effect of local topology on the shape of the central cell was an emergent property of the relaxed mechanical network at equilibrium (Figures 1D–1F; Figure S1 available online; Extended Experimental Procedures).Figure S2Tissue Measurements Reveal the Kinetics and Mechanisms Operating during Cell Shape Emergence in the Drosophila Wing Disc Epithelium, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) The conditional mitotic index, P(D|N), of a polygonal cell depends its number of sides, N.

Error bars in (A), (C), (D), and (F)–(I) represent ±1 SD. To analyze the impact of local topology on the long axis of M, we replaced one neighbor hexagon with a single N-sided cell, N. Strikingly, inserting any nonhexagonal neighbor induced a clear long axis in M, with opposite orientation of the long axis for N < 6 versus N > 6 (Figures 1D–1F; Figure 2A ). Specifically, the presence of quadrilateral or pentagonal neighbors induced a long axis parallel to the NM interface, whereas heptagons and octagons induced a long axis orthogonal to interface NM. These results suggest that in cell sheets, the orientation of a mitotic cell's longest axis can be strongly influenced by the polygon class of a single neighboring cell. As a consequence of this effect, neighbor cells with fewer sides (such as quadrilaterals and pentagons) tend to lie along the shortest axis of M, which is the location of the presumed cleavage plane. To test whether this effect was robust under more realistic conditions, we numerically relaxed heterogeneous local neighborhoods that were stochastically generated from the known polygonal cell shape distribution of the Drosophila melanogaster wing epithelium (Figure 2B) (Aegerter-Wilmsen et al., 2010Aegerter-Wilmsen T. Smith A.C. Christen A.J. Aegerter C.M. Hafen E. Basler K.

Perrimon N. The emergence of geometric order in proliferating metazoan epithelia.Nature. 2006; 442: 1038-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Even under these conditions, more than 70% of quadrilateral neighbors were positioned on the central cell's short axis, double the percentage expected by chance (Figure 2C). To quantify this relationship, we defined an acute angle, θ, with respect to the presumed cleavage plane along the central cell's short axis (see Figure 2D). On average, as a function of increasing θ, the neighbor polygon class in direction θ increased monotonically (Figure 2E). Therefore, even in a heterogeneous context, the topology of a cellular neighborhood robustly and systematically influenced the orientation of the long axis in a central cell. In both plants and animals, cells are thought to divide their long axis by forming a cleavage plane along the short axis of the cell (Hofmeister, 1863Hofmeister W.

A default mechanism of spindle orientation based on cell shape is sufficient to generate cell fate diversity in polarised Xenopus blastomeres.Development. 2006; 133: 3883-3893Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). If a cell's short axis consistently bisects its cellular neighbors having the fewest sides (Figure 2), then mitotic division planes should be disproportionately biased toward quadrilaterals and pentagons in vivo. To test this, we measured the correlation between neighbor cell polygon class and cleavage-plane orientation in the Drosophila wing imaginal disc (Figure 3A ). Here, cell division proceeds through a stereotyped process of cell rounding at the apical epithelial surface (Figures 3B–3D) (Gibson et al., 2006Gibson M.C. Patel A.B. Nagpal R. Perrimon N. The emergence of geometric order in proliferating metazoan epithelia.Nature. 2006; 442: 1038-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). To define the frequency with which different classes of polygonal neighbors were bisected by the cleavage plane, we examined 420 cells at the cytokinetic stage, which is the most stable and easily scored phase of mitosis (Figure 3E). For each case, we recorded the position of all primary neighboring polygons and computed the frequency with which each polygon class occupied the cleavage-plane position (Figures 3F and 3G). If the orientation of cell division were random with respect to local topology, approximately 28.6% of any given polygon class would be expected to correlate with the cleavage plane (two randomly chosen cells out of seven neighbors). However, in the wing disc, we found that more than 50% of quadrilaterals in the primary neighborhood occupied the division plane position (Figure 3H; n = 46/83). Further, octagons were anticorrelated with the division plane and occupied that position with less than 10% probability (n = 6/77). As predicted by the mechanical model, this cleavage-plane bias was monotone decreasing across all polygon types. We conclude that in the Drosophila wing disc, the polygonal topology of local neighborhoods strongly influences cleavage-plane orientation in mitotic cells. In order to test the assumption that Drosophila wing disc cells actually divide their longest axis, we next performed time-lapse analysis of proliferating Drosophila wing discs in ex vivo culture (see Movie S1; Experimental Procedures). For each of 198 mitotic cells (Figure 4A ), we measured the geometric long-axis orientation during both interphase (Figure 4A′, far left) and cytokinesis (Figure 4A′, far right). We found a strong tendency for cells to follow a long-axis division mechanism, although with moderate noise in the orientation (Figure 4B). This tendency to divide the longest axis correlated with the interphase geometry (Figure 4B) and increased with the cell's interphase elongation ratio (the ratio of the long axis to the short axis; Extended Experimental Procedures). For example, for the 99 cells having an elongation ratio below the median value of 1.68, the average deviation from a long-axis division mechanism was about 33°; by contrast, for the 99 cells having an elongation ratio above the median value, the average deviation was about 21° (data not shown). This dependence on the relative axis lengths suggests that these cells might be able to adjust their spindle orientations to their newly acquired shapes following mechanical strain, as has been previously reported in cell culture and in vertebrate embryonic cells (Black and Vincent, 1988Black S.D.

To test whether deviation from the long-axis division mechanism could explain the discrepancy between our cleavage-plane bias predictions and the empirical measurements, we incorporated the measured deviation into our original model (Figure 4C; Extended Experimental Procedures). Interestingly, when the measured deviation was incorporated, the mechanical predictions were significantly improved (compare the red and black curves in Figure 4C), closely matching the empirically measured bias (Figure 4C, blue curve). Therefore, cleavage-plane bias is like"

A typical migrating cell adopts front-rear polarity with asymmetrical distribution of signaling molecules and cytoskeletal components. During establishment of polarity, temporal capture and stabilization of microtubules (MTs) occur near filamentous actin (F-actin)-enriched leading edges, which enable reorientation of the MT-organizing center and Golgi complex to ensure biased vesicular transport for directional migration (Etienne-Manneville, 2004Etienne-Manneville S.

Microtubule-induced cortical cell polarity.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 483-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Among many regulatory molecules required for cell migration, the ubiquitously-expressed serine and threonine kinase glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) is particularly important in transmitting upstream signaling necessary for establishing cell polarity and guiding directional movement (Sun et al., 2009Sun T. Rodriguez M. Kim L. Glycogen synthase kinase 3 in the world of cell migration.Dev. Growth Differ. 2009; 51: 735-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In contrast to most other protein kinases, GSK3β activity is high in nonstimulated cells, but it is dampened at the leading edge of scratch-wounded astrocytes and endodermal cells in vitro and in developing neurons of brain slices ex vivo (Etienne-Manneville and Hall, 2003Etienne-Manneville S.

In vitro, GSK3β inhibition and cell polarity are known to be provoked by CDC42 (Etienne-Manneville and Hall, 2003Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Cdc42 regulates GSK-3beta and adenomatous polyposis coli to control cell polarity.Nature. 2003; 421: 753-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). In vivo, GSK3β activity is inhibited by Wnt signaling, which in turn leads to β-catenin stabilization, which plays a critical and near universal role in stem cell (SC) activation and migration (Fuchs, 2009Fuchs E.

Despite this tantalizing connection, the possible physiological relevance among Wnt signaling, SC activation, and cytoskeletal remodeling remains unclear. Another key unaddressed question is how GSK3β regulates the dynamic changes in MT organization and stabilization that transpire during polarized movements of somatic SCs. Hair follicles (HFs) provide an ideal paradigm to address these issues. Adult HFs undergo homeostasis through cyclical bouts of active growth (anagen), regression (catagen), and rest (telogen) (Figure S1A available online). They also participate in epidermal re-epithelialization during wound healing (Blanpain and Fuchs, 2009Blanpain C. Fuchs E. Epidermal homeostasis: a balancing act of stem cells in the skin.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 207-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar, Ito et al., 2005Ito M. Liu Y. Yang Z. Nguyen J. Liang F. Morris R.J. Cotsarelis G.

Defining the epithelial stem cell niche in skin.Science. 2004; 303: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (1553) Google Scholar). Both processes rely upon a resident population of SCs, which reside in a specific niche called the bulge, located at the base of the noncycling portion of the HF (Figure S1A). Wnt signaling emanating from polarized epithelial-mesenchymal crosstalk in the SC niche is critical for hair follicle stem cell (HF-SC) activation during tissue homeostasis (Greco et al., 2009Greco V. Chen T. Rendl M. Schober M. Pasolli H.A. Stokes N. Dela Cruz-Racelis J. Fuchs E. A two-step mechanism for stem cell activation during hair regeneration.Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 4: 155-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). In addition, localized Wnt signaling/β-catenin at a wound site initiates the migration of SCs after injury (Ito et al., 2005Ito M. Liu Y. Yang Z. Nguyen J. Liang F. Morris R.J. Cotsarelis G. Stem cells in the hair follicle bulge contribute to wound repair but not to homeostasis of the epidermis.Nat.

Wnt-dependent de novo hair follicle regeneration in adult mouse skin after wounding. Nature 447, 316–320.Google Scholar). Based upon these points, the potential exists for using skin as a model to dissect how signaling cues to SCs might regulate the cytoskeleton to orchestrate cell polarization and directional cell movement. In searching for potential cytoskeletal regulators in this process, we noticed that HF-SCs display significantly more actin crosslinking factor-7 (ACF7; also called MACF1, MT and actin crosslinking factor-1) than other skin epithelial cells (Blanpain et al., 2004Blanpain C.

Unique to multicellular organisms, spectraplakins such as ACF7 can bind both MT and actin networks (Jefferson et al., 2004Jefferson J.J. Leung C.L. Liem R.K.

Brown N.H. The ‘spectraplakins’: cytoskeletal giants with characteristics of both spectrin and plakin families.J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4215-4225Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Although broadly expressed, their essential functions are most clearly revealed in muscle, neurons and skin epithelial cells, which maintain elaborate yet dynamic cytoskeletal networks. Mutations in the single Drosophila spectraplakin gene (Kakapo/short-stop/shot) cause a wide variety of cellular and tissue defects that include perturbations in actin-MT organization, cell-cell adhesion and integrin-mediated epidermal attachment to muscle. There are two evolutionarily conserved mammalian counterparts. Mice lacking BPAG1/dystonin display sensory neuron and muscle degeneration and have gross defects in cytoskeletal organization and function. By contrast, mice lacking ACF7 exhibit early embryonic lethality (Chen et al., 2006Chen H.J. Lin C.M. Lin C.S. Perez-Olle R. Leung C.L. Liem R.K.

Recent studies show that mice conditionally lacking ACF7 display defects in cell migration. This was true for both K14-Cre cKO animals, impaired in skin wound healing (Wu et al., 2008Wu X. Kodama A. Fuchs E. ACF7 regulates cytoskeletal-focal adhesion dynamics and migration and has ATPase activity.Cell. 2008; 135: 137-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and for Nestin-Cre cKO mice, defective in brain development (Goryunov et al., 2010Goryunov D. He C.Z. Lin C.S. Leung C.L. Liem R.K. Nervous-tissue-specific elimination of microtubule-actin crosslinking factor 1a results in multiple developmental defects in the mouse brain.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2010; 44: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). While the loss of function data underscore the importance of spectraplakins in coordinating the cytoskeletal dynamics necessary for cells to polarize and move in a directed fashion (Rodriguez et al., 2003Rodriguez O.C. Schaefer A.W. Mandato C.A. Forscher P. Bement W.M. Waterman-Storer C.M. Conserved microtubule-actin interactions in cell movement and morphogenesis.Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar), the mechanisms underlying the regulation of spectraplakin-mediated actin-MT connections remain unknown. Similarly, lacking are the molecular details of the circuitry that must link upstream signaling pathways to cytoskeletal remodeling in order for SCs to migrate from their niche. In the present report, we make major inroads into understanding this process. We identify a link between GSK3β and ACF7 and further reveal the in vivo relevance of this connection in polarized locomotion of skin stem cells upon injury. ACF7's carboxy-terminal tail (CT) contains a Gas2-related (GAR) domain and a (GSR-repeat domain (GSR) domain. Previous studies suggest, and we have confirmed, that both domains are involved in the interaction with MTs (Sun et al., 2001Sun D. Leung C.L. Liem R.K. Characterization of the microtubule binding domain of microtubule actin crosslinking factor (MACF): identification of a novel group of microtubule associated proteins.J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 161-172PubMed Google Scholar, Wu et al., 2008Wu X. Kodama A. Fuchs E. ACF7 regulates cytoskeletal-focal adhesion dynamics and migration and has ATPase activity.Cell. 2008; 135: 137-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). To obtain structural information on this interaction, we incubated ACF7(CT) with polymerized MTs and conducted ultrastructural analyses. Under saturating conditions [4:1 molar ACF7(CT):tubulin heterodimer], ACF7(CT) markedly enhanced the electron density along the MT surface (Figure 1A ). When compared with naked MTs, ACF7(CT)-coated MTs were ∼10 nm thicker in diameter (projection profile in Figure 1A). Fourier transform analyses further indicated that whether decorated with ACF7(CT) or not, assembled MTs displayed a 40Å layer line corresponding to the packing of tubulin dimers. However, only ACF7(CT)-decorated MTs displayed discrete 80Å layer lines, suggesting that ACF7 might associate with the MT lattice with a rather weak distinction between α- and β- tubulins (Figure 1A). Interaction with the MT lattice usually involves the acidic C-terminal tails of tubulin subunits that protrude from the MT surface. To test this hypothesis, we performed binding assays between ACF7(CT) and increasing concentrations of taxol-stabilized MTs. Just prior to adding ACF7(CT), we exposed half the polymerized MTs to subtilisin to shave protruding tubulin tails (MTΔC-tail). Following ultracentrifugation, pellets were then analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and Coomassie Blue (CB) staining. Subtilisin-treated MTs still pelleted after ultracentrifugation, confirming that MTs remained assembled after treatment. Only a slight increase was noted in tubulin's electrophoretic mobility, consistent with tail removal (compare asterisked lanes in Figure 1B). However, this modification markedly diminished ACF7(CT)'s binding to MTs (Figure 1B). When ACF7(CT)'s concentration was progressively increased, its association with MTs became saturating, reflected by an increase in the soluble pool of free ACF7(CT). A Scatchard plot of the data are shown in Figure 1C. ACF7(CT) binding to untreated MTs gave a KD of ∼1.4 × 10−7 M, which was comparable to published results on GAR and GSR domains of ACF7 (Sun et al., 2001Sun D. Leung C.L. Liem R.K. Characterization of the microtubule binding domain of microtubule actin crosslinking factor (MACF): identification of a novel group of microtubule associated proteins.J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 161-172PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, the affinity of ACF7(CT) for subtilisin-treated MTs was >10× weaker (KD ∼1.5 × 10−6 M). Association with tubulin tails usually depends on electrostatic interactions between acidic tubulin C termini and positively charged surfaces of MT-binding proteins. Consistent with this notion, ACF7(CT) contains many lysine (K) and arginine (R) residues. Particularly, the GSR domain (202 amino acids) harbors 36 strongly basic residues, with a calculated isoelectric point at 11.8. Additionally, 32% of residues in ACF7's GSR domain are serine or threonine, suggestive of the potential to regulate ACF7-MT's electrostatic interactions through protein phosphorylation. To address this possibility, we transfected primary keratinocytes with ACF7(CT) and labeled them with [32P]-orthophosphate. Our results showed that ACF7(CT) is efficiently phosphorylated in vivo (Figure 1D). We next analyzed phospho-ACF7(CT) by mass spectrometry. We circumvented the difficulties posed by ACF7(CT)'s high percentage of basic residues by choosing protease AspN, which cleaves peptide bonds N-terminal to aspartate. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) identified multiple (up to six) phosphorylation sites within a peptide encompassing the GSR repeats (Figures 1E and 1F). Interestingly, the characteristic GSR repeats within this sequence have six serines that match consensus GSK3β phosphorylation sites [phosphorylation cluster-1 (P1)]. While in silico analysis with different phosphorylation prediction algorithms (Obenauer et al., 2003Obenauer J.C. Cantley L.C. Yaffe M.B. Scansite 2.0: Proteome-wide prediction of cell signaling interactions using short sequence motifs.Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3635-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar, Schiller, 2007Schiller M.R. Minimotif miner: A computational tool to investigate protein function, disease, and genetic diversity.Curr Protoc Protein Sci. 2. 2007https://doi.org/10.1002/0471140864.ps0212s48Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar) revealed additional potential GSK3β sites [phosphorylation cluster 2 (P2), Figure 1F], their incompatible sequence context precluded efficient peptide retrieval for MS/MS analysis. To determine whether ACF7 is specifically phosphorylated by GSK3, we first tested for an endogenous association between ACF7 and GSK3β proteins in HF-SCs. Immunoblot analyses revealed GSK3β in anti-ACF7 immunoprecipitates of wild-type (WT) but not ACF7 null cell lysates (Figure 2A ). In vitro kinase (IVK) assays further showed that ACF7 is a substrate for active GSK3β and that GSK3β phosphorylates ACF7(CT) but not ACF7-NT (N-terminal domain of ACF7 serving as a control) (Figure 2B). Moreover, coexpression of GSK3β with ACF7(CT) in cultured cells resulted in phosphorylation of ACF7 that was sensitive to treatment of phosphatase (Figure 2C). To assess whether our identification of GSK3β phosphorylation sites in ACF7(CT) was correct, we replaced the predicted GSK3β-targeted serines with alanines and repeated our phosphorylation assays in vitro and in vivo. Individually, mutations in P1 and P2 each reduced overall phosphorylation. Combinatorial mutations of both clusters abolished ACF7(CT) GSK3β phosphorylation (Figures 2D and 2E). Our finding of functional GSK3β phosphorylation sites in ACF7's GSR domain hinted a potential role of this signaling event in tempering ACF7's MT connection by reducing their electrostatic affinity. To test this possibility, we had to first overcome the technical hurdles of ACF7's enormous size (5380 amino acid residues) and engineer mammalian expression vectors encoding human influenza hemagglutinin epitope (HA)-tagged full-length ACF7 as well as point mutants that converted GSK3β phosphorylation sites at P1 and P2 to either a kinase-refractile version harboring Ser→Ala mutations (S:A mutant) or a phosphomimetic version, containing Ser→Asp mutations (S:D mutant). We purified the proteins by affinity chromatography (Wu et al., 2008Wu X. Kodama A. Fuchs E. ACF7 regulates cytoskeletal-focal adhesion dynamics and migration and has ATPase activity.Cell. 2008; 135: 137-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and carried out in vitro cosedimentation assays with polymerized MTs (Figure 3A ). Both HA-tagged ACF7 and its S:A mutant counterpart maintained a strong affinity for MT binding similar to WT ACF7, while ACF7(S:D) exhibited significantly reduced affinity for MTs. Similar results were obtained when the binding assays were repeated with freshly prepared lysates from cells expressing ACF7 or its mutants (Figure 3B). In contrast to the effects of S:A and S:D mutations on MT-binding affinity, ACF7's F-actin-binding affinity and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis activity were unaffected (Figures S2A and S2B ).Figure S2Phosphorylation of ACF7 by GSK3β Does Not Change ACF7's Actin-Binding Affinity or ATPase Activity.

(B) Bar graph shows quantification of actin-regulated ATPase activities of GST, ACF7 and its mutants ± F-actin. Buf Ctrl: buffer control. Error bars represent SD. To directly assess the effects of GSK3β phosphorylation, we next coexpressed constitutively active GSK3β (caGSK3β, S9A mutant) with either WT or kinase-refractile ACF7. As predicted, the MT-binding affinity of WT-ACF7 was reduced when GSK3β was superactivated (Figure 3C). This effect was specific for ACF7's C-terminal GSR domain, since GSK3β did not alter interactions between ACF7(S:A) and MTs (Figure 3C). Consistent with these results, inhibition of endogenous GSK3β activity by exposing HF-SCs to different GSK3-specific inhibitors significantly increased the MT-binding affinity of endogenous ACF7 (Figure 3D). Together, these findings provided compelling support for GSK3β as an important regulator of ACF7's association with MTs and showed that GSK3β-mediated regulation was exerted exclusively at P1 and P2 of the ACF7's GSR domain. Previously, we showed that mice targeted for loss of ACF7 in skin are defective in wound repair (Wu et al., 2008Wu X. Kodama A. Fuchs E. ACF7 regulates cytoskeletal-focal adhesion dynamics and migration and has ATPase activity.Cell. 2008; 135: 137-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), a process known to involve HF-SCs (Ito et al., 2005Ito M. Liu Y. Yang Z. Nguyen J. Liang F. Morris R.J. Cotsarelis G. Stem cells in the hair follicle bulge contribute to wound repair but not to homeostasis of the epidermis.Nat.

When coupled with the appearance of ACF7 on the list of genes upregulated in HF-SCs (Figure S1B) and an emerging role for Wnt signaling in wound repair (Fathke et al., 2006Fathke C. Wilson L. Shah K.

Distinct Wnt signaling pathways have opposing roles in appendage regeneration.Development. 2007; 134: 479-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), our finding of GSK3β as a potential regulator of ACF7 took on newfound importance and merited further investigation. To begin to evaluate how ACF7 functions in this pathway, we first purified HF-SCs (CD34hiα6-integrinhi) by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) versus other basal cells (CD34negα6-integrinhi) (Blanpain et al., 2004Blanpain C. Lowry W.E. Geoghegan A. Polak L. Fuchs E. Self-renewal, multipotency, and the existence of two cell populations within an epithelial stem cell niche.Cell. 2004; 118: 635-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). RT-PCR and immunoblot on these purified cell populations verified ACF7's enrichment in HF-SCs at both mRNA and protein levels (Figure 4A ). Immunofluorescence further documented elevated ACF7 in this niche throughout the hair cycle (Figure 4B). Loss of ACF7 in HF-SCs did not alter bulge architecture (data not shown) nor did it affect expression of key bulge markers (Blanpain and Fuchs, 2009Blanpain C. Fuchs E. Epidermal homeostasis: a balancing act of stem cells in the skin.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 207-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar) (Figure 4C). In addition, no significant changes were found in proliferation or apoptosis of homeostatic HF-SCs (more details below) or in hair growth or cycling (Wu et al., 2008Wu X. Kodama A. Fuchs E. ACF7 regulates cytoskeletal-focal adhesion dynamics and migration and has ATPase activity.Cell. 2008; 135: 137-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). We therefore focused on the hypothesis that the associated defects in wound repair originate from perturbations in HF-SC migration. To test this, we bred our ACF7fl/fl animals with mice expressing a progesterone-regulatable recombinase (K15-Cre-PGR) specifically in bulge SCs (Ito et al., 2005Ito M. Liu Y. Yang Z. Nguyen J. Liang F. Morris R.J. Cotsarelis G. Stem cells in the hair follicle bulge contribute to wound repair but not to homeostasis of the epidermis.Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 1351-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). To monitor HF-SC progeny in a wound response, we further bred these mice to Rosa26-lox-Stop-lox-LacZ reporter animals. As expected, treatment of adult mice with RU486 (a progesterone antagonist) activated Cre and selectively marked HF-SCs. When challenged to a wound, activated LacZ+ bulge cells exited the niche and migrated upward to re-epithelialize wounded epidermis (Figure 4D). This was readily observed by whole-mount staining, which displayed trails of HF-SC-derived blue (LacZ+) cells emanating from perilesional follicles of wounded tissue (dashed arrows). By contrast, ACF7 cKO bulge cells were delayed in this process by ∼40% compared with WT controls over 4–6 days after injury (Figures 4D and 4E). Importantly, since targeting was specific to bulge cells, the delay was directly attributable to an SC defect. Moreover, ACF7-deficiency did not affect proliferation or apoptosis of bulge SCs, indicating that the defect was rooted in cell migration (Figures S3A and S3B ). To examine the contribution of GSK3β in this process, we took a pharmacological approach to manipulate GSK3β activity in vivo. Wounds on WT skin were treated with either lithium chloride (LiCl), which directly inhibits GSK3β, or wortmannin, which activates GSK3β by inhibiting an upstream regulator, phosphoinositol-3 kinase (PI3K). Interestingly, both treatments impaired wound-induced cell migration out of the adult HF-SC niche (Figure 4F), suggesting that spatiotemporal regulation of GSK3β's activity is required to achieve efficient bulge SC migration in vivo. Previously, we showed that when ACF7 is ablated, cultured epidermal keratinocytes cannot coordinate microtubule growth along F-actin filaments, a feature that in turn leads to overstabilization of focal adhesions (FAs) and defective cell movement (Wu et al., 2008Wu X. Kodama A. Fuchs E. ACF7 regulates cytoskeletal-focal adhesion dynamics and migration and has ATPase activity.Cell. 2008; 135: 137-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Based on our results thus far, we posited that in vivo, HF-SCs might respond to migratory stimulations such as Wnt signaling by spatiotemporally regulating ACF7-MT connections and promoting the cytoskeletal remodeling needed for polarized migration. To test this hypothesis, we first generated phospho-specific ACF7 Abs against two synthetic phospho-peptides corresponding to the ACF7 GSR sequences encompassing P1 and P2, respectively. Each Ab was specific for the phosphorylated state of its GSK3β target sequence: when ACF7 was not phosphorylated or when the sites were selectively mutated, the Abs failed to recognize the ACF7 protein (Figures S4A and S4B ). Isolated HF-SCs can sustain long-term culture without losing stemness (Blanpain et al., 2004Blanpain C. Lowry W.E. Geoghegan A. Polak L. Fuchs E. Self-renewal, multipotency, and the existence of two cell populations within an epithelial stem cell niche.Cell. 2004; 118: 635-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar), allowing us to investigate the role of ACF7 phosphorylation in vitro. Both ACF7 Abs detected the expected sized band in immunoblots of cultured bulge SC but not ACF7 cKO lysates (Figure 5A ). Importantly, these signals were sensitive not only to chemical inhibitors of GSK3β but also to recombinant Wnt3a. These data confirmed the specificity of our phospho-specific Abs an"

Labeit S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1952-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 6Idowu S.M. Gautel M. Perkins S.J. Pfuhl M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 745-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), the insertion of two extra phosphorylation sites in the MyBP-C motif, located at the N terminus between domains C1 and C2, and an extra domain at its N terminus (C0) (5Gautel M. Zuffardi O. Freiburg A. Labeit S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1952-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). MyBP-C was suggested to function as a tether that holds on to myosin heads close to the S1-S2 neck region through its N terminus (7Weisberg A. Winegrad S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 8999-9003Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 8McClellan G. Kulikovskaya I. Winegrad S. Biophys.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 254-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) in a phosphorylation-regulated manner involving the MyBP-C motif (10Gruen M. Prinz H. Gautel M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 254-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 11Kunst G. Kress K.R. Gruen M. Uttenweiler D. Gautel M. Fink R.H.A. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The observation that short N-terminal fragments of MyBP-C, too short to perform a tethering role, are also able to influence S1 activity hinted at an additional, more direct way in which MyBP-C could regulate muscle contraction (11Kunst G. Kress K.R. Gruen M. Uttenweiler D. Gautel M. Fink R.H.A. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 12Herron T.J. Rostkova E. Kunst G. Chaturvedi R. Gautel M. Kentish J.C. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 1290-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 13Harris S.P. Rostkova E. Gautel M. Moss R.L. Circ. Res. 2004; 95: 930-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Recently, we positioned the binding site for MyBP-C domain C1 right next to the S1-S2 hinge in immediate proximity to the regulatory light chain (14Ababou A. Rostkova E. Mistry S. Le Masurier C. Gautel M. Pfuhl M. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 384: 615-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). As domain C2 is located further C-terminal on S2 (15Ababou A. Gautel M. Pfuhl M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9204-9215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), it would be plausible to look for an interaction site for the most N-terminal domain of MyBP-C further N-terminally on myosin. An interaction between the cardiac isoform of MyBP-C and the regulatory light chain (RLC) of myosin has been proposed as early as 1985 (16Margossian S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13747-13754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Most likely, such an interaction might take place via the cardiac-specific domain C0. This would be entirely in agreement with results obtained with short, N-terminal MyBP-C fragments because these contained domain C0 (11Kunst G. Kress K.R. Gruen M. Uttenweiler D. Gautel M. Fink R.H.A. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 12Herron T.J. Rostkova E. Kunst G. Chaturvedi R. Gautel M. Kentish J.C. Circ.

The assumption would be that these fragments somehow influence myosin activity via the RLC. The RLC is positioned in the neck region of myosin and, together with the essential light chain (ELC), stabilizes the 8.5-nm-long end of the lever helix by wrapping around it (17Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Bäse K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1877) Google Scholar, 18Xie X.

Nature. 1994; 368: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) in the region spanning residues 808 and 842 (Fig. 1). The RLC seems to be of great importance for both myosin structure and function. Selective removal of the RLC causes a change in the structure of the cardiac myosin molecule (19Margossian S.S. Slayter H.S. J. Muscle Res. Cell. Motil. 1987; 8: 437-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), leading to myosin disorder (9Levine R. Weisberg A. Kulikovskaya I. McClellan G. Winegrad S. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 1070-1082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and, importantly, weakens binding to MyBP-C (16Margossian S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13747-13754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The RLC is also phosphorylated at its N terminus upon adrenergic stimulation (20Takashima S. Circ. J. 2009; 73: 208-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), although the relevance of this in cardiac muscle, in contrast to e.g. smooth muscle, is not completely understood (21Scruggs S.B. Hinken A.C. Thawornkaiwong A. Robbins J. Walker L.A. de Tombe P.P. Geenen D.L. Buttrick P.M. Solaro R.J. J. Biol.

The regulatory light chain is a member of the superfamily of EF-hand Ca2+-binding protein and is also linked to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), with currently seven known mutations that are linked to hereditary cardiac disease (UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot accession number P10916). Several different genes exist for RLC encoding numerous isoforms, among others, for cardiac and skeletal muscle, similar to MyBP-C. In the present work, our focus has been determining the structure of the cardiac-specific domain C0 and studying its interaction with the S1 fragment of myosin and more precisely with the regulatory light chain that associates with it. MyBP-C and RLC, together with other sarcomeric proteins, are both linked to HCM, a genetic disorder leading to cardiac dysfunction that can manifest itself through arrhythmias, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death, especially in the young. Domain C0 shows three missense mutations linked to HCM in human (Sarcomere Protein Gene Mutation Database and UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot accession number Q14896) and one in Maine Coon cats (24Meurs K.M. Sanchez X. David R.M. Bowles N.E. Towbin J.A. Reiser P.J. Kittleson J.A. Munro M.J. Dryburgh K. Macdonald K.A. Kittleson M.D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 3587-3593Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), making it one of the domains presenting the fewest HCM mutations, surprisingly given its unique cardiac nature. In this work, we study the structure and dynamics of domain C0 and show that it binds to the RLC. We map the binding site and show the effect upon the interaction by some HCM-related mutations. Our biophysical results are backed up by immunofluorescence studies showing C0 co-localizing by itself in the A-band, consistent with an interaction around the myosin heads. Domain C0 (residues 1–95 of human cardiac MyBP-C) was cloned in vector pET8c and expressed and purified as described previously for domain C5 (6Idowu S.M. Gautel M. Perkins S.J. Pfuhl M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 745-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Isotope-enriched samples were produced by expression in M9 minimal medium supplemented with uniformly 13C-enriched glucose (CIL) and/or [15N]ammonium chloride (CIL) as unique sources of carbon and nitrogen, respectively. The four mutants produced for the mutagenesis studies were cloned in vector pLEICS-03 (available from the Protex laboratory at the University of Leicester) and expressed in LB medium as wild type. The miniHMM heavy chain construct contains residues 806–963 of the cardiac β-myosin heavy chain (NM_000257). The fragment contains the RLC binding site (residues 806–835) and the N-terminal part of the coiled-coil myosin rod, S2Δ (848–963) (10Gruen M. Prinz H. Gautel M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 254-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The myosin fragment was cloned into a modified pET8c vector with ampicillin resistance containing a His6 tag and tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site. This fragment was impossible to express on its own, probably due to its instability caused by the very likely unfolded RLC binding site. In contrast, the S2Δ fragment alone was easily expressed in Escherichia coli with a high yield as described previously (25Gruen M. Gautel M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 933-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). To stabilize the RLC binding site, we co-expressed the miniHMM myosin heavy chain fragment with cardiac RLC (GI_4557774) cloned into the pACYC vector with kanamycin resistance. The two plasmids were co-transformed into BL21 [DE3] RIL-competent cells and grown on plates and media containing both antibiotics. Protein was purified using polyhistidine binding nickel chelate resin (HiTrap) by standard procedures. The purified protein was cleaved by tobacco etch virus protease, and tag, uncleaved protein, and tobacco etch virus protease were removed by one pass over a nickel HiTrap. The same procedure was used for cloning and expression of the RLC binding site cloned in pET8c and co-expressed with the RLC. Different samples were prepared to perform the NMR experiments: [13C/15N C0] = 1.4 mm, [15N C0] = 670 μm, [C0Ar] = 1.7 mm in 50 mm phosphate buffer at pH 7 containing 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, and 0.01% NaN3. The first, doubly labeled sample was used to record the triple resonance experiments, HNCaCb, HN(CO)CaCb, HN(Ca)CO, HNCO, HN(CaCb)HaHb, HN(CaCbCO)HaHb (26Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Annu. Rev.

Reson. 1994; 105: 196-198Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and the 13C-specific experiments such as 1H/13C HSQC, 1H/13C HCCH TOCSY (29Bax A. Clore M. Driscoll P.C. Gronenborn A.M. Ikura M. Kay L.E. J. Magn. Reson. 1990; 87: 620Google Scholar), and 1H/13C NOESY-HSQC (30Majumdar A. Zuiderweg E.P. J. Magn. Reson. 1993; 102: 242Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar); from the 15N-enriched sample were obtained 1H/15N HSQC, 1H/15N TOCSY-HSQC, and 1H/15N NOESY-HSQC. An unlabeled sample was used to record the spectra relative to the aromatic side chains 1H/1H TOCSY and 1H/1H nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY). The NMR samples were concentrated in Vivaspin 20 concentrators with 3-kDa molecular mass cutoff (Sartorius) and transferred to a clean NMR tube (Shigemi). The 13C/15N C0 and C0Ar samples were frozen and lyophilized overnight to eliminate the water and then resuspended in high purity D2O (Sigma). All NMR spectra were obtained using in-house modified pulse sequences based on the standard pulse sequences provided by Bruker. They were collected on Bruker Avance spectrometers at 600 MHz, with and without cryoprobe, or 800 MHz with cryoprobe at 303 K. NMR spectra were processed with Topspin and analyzed with CCPNMR Analysis software. Sequence-specific assignments were deposited in the Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank (BMRB) with accession code 5679. Relaxation analysis was performed by measuring 15N R1, R2, and 1H-15N heteronuclear NOE experiments (31Barbato G. Ikura M. Kay L.E. Pastor R.W. Bax A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5269-5278Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar) on a 15N-labeled sample. R1 was measured with delays of 16, 48, 96, 192, 288, 384, 512, 704, 880, 1120, and 1440 ms; R2 was measured with delays of 5, 10, 15, 20, 31, 41, 61, 82, 102, 133, 154 ms. The heteronuclear NOEs were measured with a proton saturation period of 3 s. Relaxation rates were extracted from the time series by exponential fit using customized macros in the program Mathematica (Wolfram Research). Relaxation rates were initially used to obtain the rotational correlation time from R1/R2. using the value of τc obtained, and a Lipari-Szabo analysis (32Lipari G. Szabo A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 4546-4559Crossref Scopus (3409) Google Scholar, 33Lipari G. Szabo A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 4559-4570Crossref Scopus (1877) Google Scholar, 34Clore G.M. Szabo A. Bax A. Kay L.E. Driscoll P.C. Gronenborn A.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 4989-4991Crossref Scopus (972) Google Scholar) was performed for all individual residues. Interaction studies were carried out by measuring 1H-15N HSQC spectra (35Gronenborn A.M. Bax A. Wingfield P.T. Clore G.M. FEBS Lett. 1989; 243: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) of 50 μm 15N-labeled C0 without and with binding partner, RLC, RLC-MyBS, or miniHMM at a concentration of 200 μm. The experiment was repeated for G5R, R35W, and K87E mutants of C0 under identical conditions. Spectra were recorded at 800 MHz and a temperature of 298 K using standard NMR buffer. For analysis, 1H and 15N chemical shift perturbations were combined according to Δδ = |Δδ(1H)| + 0.15 × |Δδ(15N)| (36Mulder F.A. Schipper D. Bott R. Boelens R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) and plotted against the sequence. The weighting used in this study is different from that used in previous work on interactions of domains of MyBP-C (14Ababou A. Rostkova E. Mistry S. Le Masurier C. Gautel M. Pfuhl M. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 384: 615-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 15Ababou A. Gautel M. Pfuhl M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9204-9215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) so that the chemical shift perturbations appear relatively smaller. The automatic assignment of the peaks picked manually in the three-dimensional 1H/13C NOESY HSQC experiment was carried out using the CANDID protocol (37Herrmann T. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 24: 171-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), as part of the software CYANA 2.1 (38Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2558) Google Scholar). Out of the total 2460 peaks, 88% were assigned (2170), whereas just 292 (12%) were left unassigned at the end of the procedure; all these unassigned peaks were the product of artifacts in the NMR experiments and were all checked manually at the end of the automatic assignment procedure. The final family of structures for domain C0 was obtained using 1360 structural constraints derived from experimental NMR data, including 441 sequential (i, i + 1), 85 medium range (i, i ≤ 4), and 628 long range (i, i ≥ 5) upper distance limits, 180 backbone torsion angle constraints (90 ϕ and 90 ψ) produced by the program TALOS (39Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar), and 26 hydrogen bond constraints found in regions with defined secondary structure. Following the final round of CYANA calculation, 81 converged structures were obtained from 100 random starting structures. The converged structures contain no distance or van der Waals violation grater than 0.5 Å and no dihedral angle violations grater than 5° (Table 1).TABLE 1Structural statistics for domain C0Input constraintsDihedral angle constraints180NOE-derived distances1142Hydrogen bond constraints26Structure statisticsBackbone r.m.s.d.0.4 ÅHeavy atom r.m.s.d.Residues in core region of Ramachandran plot83.70%Residues in allowed region of Ramachandran plot100.00%Average/maximal violation of NOE constraints0.013/0.2 ÅAverage/maximal violation of dihedral constraints0.223/4° Open table in a new tab Investigation of thermally induced protein denaturation was performed using a VP-DSC differential scanning calorimeter (MicroCal). Protein samples were in 25 mm MES, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol and were heated from 10 to 80 °C with constant rate 1 °C/min. Protein concentrations were 80 μm for C0 and C1, 65 μm for S2Δ, 70 μm for RLC, and 65 μm for miniHMM (summarized molecular weights of extended S2Δ and RLC were used for calculation of molar concentration of miniHMM). To obtain information on the reversibility of thermally induced denaturation, samples were heated at the same rate immediately after cooling down after the first denaturation. As some of investigated proteins were unfolding reversibly, we could not use traces obtained from the second denaturation to correct for instrument background. In our experiments, calorimetric traces were therefore corrected by subtracting the scans of the buffer in both cells of the calorimeter. Data were analyzed using Origin 7 software (OriginLab Corp.). Cardiac MyBP-C C0 was cloned into an HA-tagged mammalian expression vector as described previously (40Lange S. Himmel M. Auerbach D. Agarkova I. Hayess K. Fürst D.O. Perriard J.C. Ehler E. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The constructs were transfected into neonatal rat ventricular myocytes using standard procedures, and cells were maintained as described (41Auerbach D. Bantle S. Keller S. Hinderling V. Leu M. Ehler E. Perriard J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1297-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The transfected cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde after 2–3 days in culture, and stained with anti-HA tag antibody (clone 3F10, Roche Applied Science), anti-myosin heavy chain (clone A4.1025, a gift from S. Hughes), and anti α-actinin (Sigma) or Alexa Fluor 633 phalloidin (Molecular Probes) for visualization of F-actin. The specimens were analyzed by confocal microscopy using a Zeiss LSM-510 Meta microscope under 63× magnification and 2–5× zoom. The molecular structure of domain C0 was determined using three-dimensional 15N- and 13C-resolved NOESY spectra supplemented by dihedral restraints obtained from chemical shift analysis and hydrogen bond constraints. The NMR data are available from the Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank (accession code 5679), whereas the atomic coordinates were deposited in the Protein Data Bank (2K1M). The good quality of the structure is shown by the high degree of agreement between the 20 structures shown in Fig. 2A, which shows 20 of the 81 converged structures as result of the structure calculation carried out with the program CYANA. The average backbone r.m.s.d. is 0.4 Å for the structured portion with the only exception of the N terminus of the domain, which also corresponds to the N terminus of the whole cardiac isoform of MyBP-C, which is completely unstructured (Figs. 2A and Fig. 3).FIGURE 3Dynamics of domain C0. Order parameters S2 from the Lipari-Szabo analysis of 15N relaxation data are shown in the top panel, and average r.m.s.d. values from the top 20 structures in the ensemble are shown in the bottom panel. Both are plotted against the sequence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm the highly disordered nature of the N terminus, the dynamic properties of C0 were studied by 15N relaxation experiments at T = 298 K. The relaxation results were analyzed using the Lipari-Szabo approach (32Lipari G. Szabo A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 4546-4559Crossref Scopus (3409) Google Scholar, 33Lipari G. Szabo A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 4559-4570Crossref Scopus (1877) Google Scholar). The rotation correlation time (τc) for the domain was determined based on the ratios of the two relaxation times T1 and T2, giving a value of 5.81 ± 0.16 ns, in good agreement with the expected value of about 5 ns for a protein of 10 kDa, according to a simple calculation using the Stokes-Einstein equation. The main result of the Lipari-Szabo analysis is the information about the local rigidity of the molecule, expressed by the order parameter S2 values determined for each residue (Fig. 3). The plot of S2 against residue number shows a uniformly rigid structure with S2 values of 0.8–0.9, typical for a well structured protein. In contrast, the N terminus is unstructured with S2 values dropping to around 0.2 for the first 7–8 amino acids, in agreement with the r.m.s.d. values (Fig. 3), which are significantly increased for residues 1–9 when compared with the rest of the protein. Based on the results obtained for domains C1 and C2 (14Ababou A. Rostkova E. Mistry S. Le Masurier C. Gautel M. Pfuhl M. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 384: 615-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 15Ababou A. Gautel M. Pfuhl M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9204-9215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and in accordance with previous suggestions (16Margossian S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13747-13754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it was hypothesized that domain C0 could interact, among others, with the RLC. The interaction was investigated in vitro using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and NMR spectroscopy, using both RLC bound to its myosin binding site as well as miniHMM and S2Δ as a negative control (Fig. 1). DSC was used to analyze thermally induced denaturation of domain C0, fragments of myosin, and their complexes (as control, domain C1 was also investigated in exactly the same way; supplemental Fig. S1). Thermal denaturation curves of C0 with miniHMM and S2Δ are shown in Fig. 4, A and B, respectively. In each, the denaturation of C0 alone (red), the myosin fragment alone (green), and their mixture (black) are superimposed. Denaturation of C0 alone is well reproducible with a single well defined peak at a temperature of 57 °C, almost completely reversible (supplemental Fig. S1). Thermal denaturation of miniHMM in Fig. 4A shows a sharp peak with a maximum at 50 °C and a broad, less thermostable shoulder with a maximum approximately at 38 °C. The denaturation of S2Δ in Fig. 4B has only a single peak around 34 °C, suggesting that the low temperature transition belongs to the coiled-coil portion, whereas the higher temperature transition corresponds to the RLC bound to the myosin binding site. The small increase in melting temperature from S2Δ to miniHMM is likely to be caused by the interaction of the myosin fragment on the RLC. Unfolding of the coiled-coil domain was partially reversible (supplemental Fig. S1) in good agreement with our own data (42Holtzer M.E. Holtzer A. Biopolymers. 1990; 30: 985-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 43Levitsky D.I. Rostkova E.V. Orlov V.N. Nikolaeva O.P. Moiseeva L.N. Teplova M.V. Gusev N.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1869-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The experimental denaturation curves of the mixtures of C0 with miniHMM (Fig. 4A) and S2Δ (Fig. 4B) are markedly different; in the mixture with S2Δ, the denaturation curve is virtually identical to the addition of the two individual curves. The high temperature denaturation peak, corresponding to C0, is slightly shifted by 2 °C to a lower melting temperature, possibly indicating a weak, unspecific interaction. The DSC profile of the denaturation of the mixture of miniHMM and C0 is more complex. At 51.5 °C, a sharp exothermic drop brings the curve to baseline, and then it returns back and forms a shoulder of the main peak. Such an exothermic peak is a very rare effect and normally reflects either fast aggregation (43Levitsky D.I. Rostkova E.V. Orlov V.N. Nikolaeva O.P. Moiseeva L.N. Teplova M.V. Gusev N.B. Eur. J.

Rostkova E.V. Nikolaeva O.P. Drachev V.A. Gusev N.B. Levitsky D.I. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 241-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In our experiments, the appearance of this exothermic peak cannot be explained by aggregation because after the peak, in the temperature region between 60 and 80 °C, the experimental curve follows the baseline and does not have any noise. Furthermore, the sample extracted from the cell after heating did not show any discernible traces of aggregation. This extremely unusual behavior was reproduced in a mixture of C0 with RLC-MyBS (data not shown), suggesting that it is indeed the interaction of C0 with the RLC that causes such an unusual thermodynamic signature. Furthermore, control experiments of miniHMM or RLC-MyBS with C1 did not show any sign of interaction let alone such an unusual exothermic event (data not shown). The same mixtures investigated by DSC were also studied by ITC, and the resulting titration curves are shown in Fig. 4C for C0 + miniHMM and in Fig. 4D for C0 + S2Δ. A very clear binding curve with saturation at an excess of C0 over miniHMM of around 1.5–2.0 confirms an interaction. Fitting the binding curve in Fig. 4C yields a dissociation constant of 3.2 ± 1.7 μm and a stoichiometry of C0:miniHMM of 1:0.81 ± 0.16. In contrast, as shown in Fig. 4D, no interaction can be detected between domain C0 and S2Δ. Initial interaction studies were performed with purified RLC alone by re"

Here, we investigated the participation of iron on calcium signal generation and ERK1/2 stimulation induced by the glutamate agonist N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA), and the effects of iron addition/chelation on hippocampal basal synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation (LTP). Addition of NMDA to primary hippocampal cultures elicited persistent calcium signals that required functional NMDA receptors and were independent of calcium influx through L-type calcium channels or α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors; NMDA also promoted ERK1/2 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. Iron chelation with desferrioxamine or inhibition of ryanodine receptor (RyR)-mediated calcium release with ryanodine-reduced calcium signal duration and prevented NMDA-induced ERK1/2 activation. Iron addition to hippocampal neurons readily increased the intracellular labile iron pool and stimulated reactive oxygen species production; the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine or the hydroxyl radical trapper MCI-186 prevented these responses. Iron addition to primary hippocampal cultures kept in calcium-free medium elicited calcium signals and stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation; RyR inhibition abolished these effects. Iron chelation decreased basal synaptic transmission in hippocampal slices, inhibited iron-induced synaptic stimulation, and impaired sustained LTP in hippocampal CA1 neurons induced by strong stimulation.

Current understanding of the relationship between neuronal function and brain iron status is sparse, and the molecular mechanisms underlying the essential role of iron in neuronal function remain mostly unidentified. Nonetheless, a role for iron in synaptic plasticity and the associated generation of postsynaptic Ca2+ signals has begun to emerge (10Hidalgo C. Núñez M.T.

The iron concentration in cerebrospinal fluid is sufficient to saturate the binding capacity of transferrin (13Symons M.C.R. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals and Iron: Chemistry, Biology and Medicine. Oxford University Press, New York1998Google Scholar). This feature highlights the need for transferrin-independent iron uptake, which is likely to occur in neurons that express the iron transporter DMT1, such as hippocampal pyramidal and granule cells, cerebellar granule cells, pyramidal cells of the piriform cortex, substantia nigra, and the ventral portion of the anterior olfactory nucleus (14Gunshin H.

The high DMT1 expression levels in these neurons suggest that DMT1-mediated iron uptake is necessary for their function.Iron uptake into neurons stimulates the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) 3The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; NMDA, N-methyl-d-aspartate; RyR, ryanodine receptor; LTP, long-term potentiation; AMPA, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid; LIP, labile iron pool; Fe-NTA, FeCl3-sodium nitrilotriacetate; DCDHF-DA, 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate; DCF, 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein; DFO, desferrioxamine; NAC, N-acetylcysteine; ACSF, artificial cerebrospinal fluid; TBS, theta burst stimulation; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; fEPSP, field excitatory postsynaptic potential. and modifies the redox potential established by the intracellular levels of oxidized and reduced glutathione (17Núñez M.T. Gallardo V. Muñoz P. Tapia V. Esparza A. Salazar J. Speisky H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 37: 953-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Consequently, by modifying the cellular redox potential, iron is likely to modulate the balance between reduced and oxidized sulfhydryl groups in proteins. Iron, through the Haber-Weiss and Fenton reactions, is also a net generator of ROS, including the highly reactive hydroxyl radical (18Halliwell B. Plant Physiol. 2006; 141: 312-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1517) Google Scholar, 19Halliwell B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2009; 46: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar).A link between ROS and normal neuronal function has been established; it is now known that activity-dependent hippocampal ROS generation is required for synaptic plasticity and memory (20Kishida K.T. Klann E. Antioxid Redox. Signal. 2007; 9: 233-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Glutamate or N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) enhance ROS production (21Bindokas V.P. Jordán J. Lee C.C.

Res. 2005; 79: 262-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and recent studies indicate that NMDA receptor activation enhances superoxide generation through NADPH oxidase stimulation (23Girouard H.

Noteworthy, Fenton-generated hydroxyl radicals have a key role in NMDA-induced neuronal toxicity in cortical neurons in culture (25Cheah J.H. Kim S.F. Hester L.D. Clancy K.W. Patterson 3rd, S.E. Papadopoulos V. Snyder S.H. Neuron. 2006; 51: 431-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Moreover, the redox-sensitive ryanodine receptor (RyR) Ca2+ release channels, which contribute to generate the postsynaptic Ca2+ signals required for sustained LTP (26Lu Y.F. Hawkins R.D. J. Neurophysiol. 2002; 88: 1270-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 27Obenaus A. Mody I. Baimbridge K.G. Neurosci. Lett. 1989; 98: 172-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) are likely targets for iron-generated ROS. In fact, iron promotes RyR-mediated Ca2+ release in PC12 cells (28Muñoz P. Zavala G. Castillo K. Aguirre P. Hidalgo C. Núñez M.T. Biol. Res. 2006; 39: 189-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).Here, we used cultured hippocampal neurons to study the effects of iron addition or iron chelation on NMDA receptor-dependent Ca2+ signal generation and ERK1/2 activation. We also investigated in hippocampal slices the effects of iron addition/chelation on basal synaptic transmission and LTP. Our results indicate that iron is essential to elicit RyR-mediated Ca2+ signals following NMDA receptor stimulation, and that these Ca2+ signals stimulate ERK1/2 phosphorylation, a requisite step of sustained hippocampal CA1 LTP. Our results also show that iron is required for basal synaptic transmission and sustained hippocampal LTP.DISCUSSIONLimited but compelling evidence indicates that iron is necessary for hippocampus-dependent learning processes (4McEchron M.D. Paronish M.D. Nutr. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 7Maaroufi K. Ammari M. Jeljeli M. Roy V. Sakly M. Abdelmelek H. Physiol.

Redox Signal. 2007; 9: 245-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Until now, however, current knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of iron in neuronal function has remained scarce. In this work, we report novel findings indicating that ROS generated by iron are required for NMDA-induced and RyR-mediated ERK1/2 phosphorylation/nuclear translocation in primary hippocampal neurons. The electrophysiological studies presented here also indicate that iron is needed for basal synaptic transmission and sustained hippocampal CA1 LTP.Contrasting with the scant knowledge on the role of iron in synaptic plasticity, a large amount of information supports a function for Ca2+ in this process. Stimulation of NMDA receptors by strong synaptic activity generates robust Ca2+ signals that stimulate the ERK1/2 cascade (40Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Manasian Y. Ivanov A. Tyzio R. Pellegrino C. Ben-Ari Y. Clapham D.E. Medina I. Neuron. 2003; 40: 775-784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 51Hetman M. Kharebava G. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2006; 6: 787-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) presumably via Ras activation (52Cullen P.J. Lockyer P.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Nuclear translocation of the phosphorylated ERK1/2 proteins promotes the subsequent downstream phosphorylation of transcription factor CREB at serine 133, a requisite step for the CREB-dependent gene expression that underlies NMDA receptor-dependent late phase LTP at hippocampal CA3 to CA1 synapses (53Thomas G.M. Huganir R.L. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar).Here, we found that stimulation of primary hippocampal cultures with NMDA elicited a sustained cellular Ca2+ concentration increase that was composed of an early and a late component. Ryanodine and the iron chelator DFO abolished the late component, an indication that both RyR and iron are needed for the sustained Ca2+ increase elicited by NMDA receptor stimulation. In addition, we show that ryanodine or iron chelation inhibited both NMDA-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of the phosphorylated ERK1/2 proteins, suggesting that functional RyR and iron are essential to generate the Ca2+ signals needed to fully stimulate the ERK pathway by NMDA.Previous work by our group showed that iron stimulates RyR-mediated Ca2+ release in PC12 cells (28Muñoz P. Zavala G. Castillo K. Aguirre P. Hidalgo C. Núñez M.T. Biol. Res. 2006; 39: 189-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In this work, we expanded those observations to hippocampal neurons in culture. We found that iron addition produced a fast LIP increase, suggesting that iron readily enters neuronal cells. The LIP increase was associated with ROS production, as determined by DCF fluorescence. We propose that iron stimulates RyR-mediated Ca2+ release through its capacity to generate ROS. Redox-active cations such as Fe2+ and Cu+ contribute to generate superoxide anion via the Haber-Weiss reaction (13Symons M.C.R. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals and Iron: Chemistry, Biology and Medicine. Oxford University Press, New York1998Google Scholar). Superoxide rapidly dismutates to hydrogen peroxide, a mild oxidant that when added to primary hippocampal neurons produces redox modifications of the highly redox-sensitive RyR Ca2+ release channel, prompting the emergence of RyR-mediated Ca2+ signals that stimulate ERK and CREB phosphorylation (29Kemmerling U. Muñoz P. Müller M. Sánchez G. Aylwin M.L. Klann E. Carrasco M.A. Hidalgo C. Cell Calcium. 2007; 41: 491-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).Our previous studies with single RyR channels from muscle and brain have shown that the RyR redox state determines RyR activation by Ca2+, so that only oxidized RyR are activated by increases in [Ca2+] within the physiological range (54Bull R. Finkelstein J.P. Gálvez J. Sánchez G. Donoso P. Behrens M.I. Hidalgo C. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 9463-9472Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 55Bull R. Finkelstein J.P. Humeres A. Behrens M.I. Hidalgo C. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2007; 293: C162-C171Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we propose that hippocampal neurons require iron to provide the cellular ROS necessary to modify RyR, a requisite condition for their efficient activation via Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release after NMDA receptor stimulation. This proposal provides an explanation for the inhibitory effects of DFO on the long-lasting NMDA-induced Ca2+ signals that promote ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Moreover, we show here that iron chelation with DFO abolished the RyR-dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation increase produced by H2O2 in hippocampal slices. These results support our proposal that iron-mediated ROS generation is required to stimulate RyR-mediated Ca2+ release.Synaptic plasticity is an activity-dependent neuronal response associated with learning and memory that entails significant modifications in the efficacy of synaptic transmission (56Gruart A. Muñoz M.D. Delgado-Garciá J.M. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 1077-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 57Bliss T.V. Collingridge G.L.

Neurosci. 2007; 27: 8031-8039Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The role of Ca2+ release from intracellular stores in synaptic plasticity is broadly acknowledged (61Bardo S. Cavazzini M.G. Emptage N. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2006; 27: 78-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Functional RyR are required for hippocampal LTP, because RyR inhibition with dantrolene (27Obenaus A. Mody I. Baimbridge K.G. Neurosci. Lett. 1989; 98: 172-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) or ryanodine (26Lu Y.F. Hawkins R.D. J. Neurophysiol. 2002; 88: 1270-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) prevents long lasting CA1 hippocampal LTP induction. Calcium release is also important for both short-term and long-term plasticity in hippocampal glutamatergic synapses that are independent of NMDA receptor activity (62Lauri S.E. Bortolotto Z.A. Nistico R. Bleakman D. Ornstein P.L. Lodge D. Isaac J.T. Collingridge G.L. Neuron. 2003; 39: 327-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar).Only a few studies have addressed the role of iron on LTP (4McEchron M.D. Paronish M.D. Nutr. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 6Jorgenson L.A. Sun M. O'Connor M. Georgieff M.K. Hippocampus. 2005; 15: 1094-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 10Hidalgo C. Núñez M.T. IUBMB Life. 2007; 59: 280-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Pursuing this earlier work, we report here that iron chelation depressed basal synaptic transmission in hippocampal slices but did not affect paired pulse facilitation, suggesting a postsynaptic target for iron. The depression of basal synaptic transmission by DFO, an LTD-like response, required functional NMDA receptors because it was abrogated by the NMDA receptor inhibitor dl-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid. The requirement for functional NMDA receptors is an interesting observation that does not have an expeditious explanation. The postsynaptic Ca2+ signals generated in hippocampal CA1 dendritic spines during basal synaptic transmission are primarily derived from RyR-mediated Ca2+ release (63Emptage N. Bliss T.V. Fine A. Neuron. 1999; 22: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that DFO, by decreasing significantly the postsynaptic [Ca2+] increase induced by NMDA in primary neurons, presumably reduces also the amplitude of Ca2+ signals in postsynaptic spines during basal synaptic transmission. The resulting low amplitude and short lasting postsynaptic Ca2+ signals generated in the presence of DFO, which are due solely to limited Ca2+ influx through NMDA receptors because DFO suppressed RyR-mediated Ca2+ release, may engage signaling cascades that inhibit AMPA receptor trafficking to the postsynaptic membrane (64Hanley J.G. Henley J.M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3266-3278Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Futures studies should address if this proposed mechanism accounts for the inhibition of basal synaptic transmission produced by iron chelation with DFO.The present findings indicate that iron addition facilitated the induction of LTP with suboptimal tetanic stimulation, whereas iron chelation with DFO inhibited sustained LTP. Moreover, at higher concentrations iron produced an increased postsynaptic response even in the absence of stimulation, which was significantly prevented by preincubation with DFO. These combined results suggest that iron is needed post-synaptically to activate Ca2+-dependent pathways downstream of NMDA receptors, including RyR-mediated Ca2+ release, which are required to maintain sustained hippocampal LTP.We propose that the essential role of iron in LTP resides in its ability to stimulate the production of ROS needed to generate the robust postsynaptic Ca2+ signals required for ERK1/2 phosphorylation and the ensuing stimulation of downstream signaling cascades. Moreover, stimulation of NMDA receptors participates in neuronal iron homeostasis through activation of nitric oxide-dependent signaling cascades (25Cheah J.H. Kim S.F. Hester L.D. Clancy K.W. Patterson 3rd, S.E. Papadopoulos V. Snyder S.H. Neuron. 2006; 51: 431-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Noteworthy, both NMDA and spatial memory training in a Morris water maze enhance the hippocampal expression of the iron transporter DMT1 (16Haeger P. Alvarez A. Leal N. Adasme T. Nunez M.T. Hidalgo C. Neurotox. Res. 2009; 17: 238-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), suggesting that neuronal activity stimulates this particular iron entry pathway to ensure an adequate iron supply.In summary, the results presented here give strong support to a sequence of events whereby NMDA receptor stimulation leads to increased cytoplasmic [Ca2+] and superoxide production, probably via NADPH oxidase (41Kishida K.T. Pao M. Holland S.M. Klann E. J. Neurochem. 2005; 94: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Superoxide dismutates to hydrogen peroxide, which reacts with iron to generate hydroxyl-free radicals. The resulting ROS increase would facilitate RyR-mediated Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release via redox modification of the RyR protein. In turn, the ensuing intracellular [Ca2+] increase would activate the ERK pathway as required for sustained LTP. Iron and RyR-mediated Ca2+ release play essential roles in this process, because their removal largely prevents ERK1/2 activation. These results highlight the central role of iron in neuronal processes, and may contribute to explain why iron deficiency is so deleterious to normal cognitive functions.

Consequently, by modifying the cellular redox potential, iron is likely to modulate the balance between reduced and oxidized sulfhydryl groups in proteins. Iron, through the Haber-Weiss and Fenton reactions, is also a net generator of ROS, including the highly reactive hydroxyl radical (18Halliwell B.

Approximately 3% of the population of the world are chronically infected with HCV. Over 30% of them will develop cirrhosis within 20 years, which subsequently may lead to hepatocellular carcinoma (1Kim W.R. Hepatology. 2002; 36: S30-S34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2El-Serag H.B.

A vaccine is not available and the optimal current therapy for patients infected with HCV is a combination of the pegylated interferon (IFN) and ribavirin. However, the therapy with these agents is prolonged, costly, and associated with a high rate of side effects. Furthermore, the sustained virologic response rate to the combination therapy varies with different genotypes of HCV. Although small molecule inhibitors of viral protease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase are in clinical development, the error prone nature of the viral RNA polymerase leads to rapid emergence of viral-resistant mutations to these therapeutic candidates. Therefore, a new approach to control HCV proliferation could be identifying the host factors involved in the HCV life cycle. HCV relies heavily on host proteins for all steps of its life cycle, including viral entry, uncoating, replication, assembly, and virion release. Therefore, any step that can interrupt the HCV life cycle will be a putative target for HCV therapy. hepatitis C virus cell culture grown HCV nonstructural 5A phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase type IIIα tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate quantitative real time amino acids SH3 domain.

In this study, we identified PI4KIIIα as a binding partner for the NS5A protein. Silencing of PI4KIIIα significantly reduced HCV replication and virion release in HCV-infected cells. These data suggest that HCV may modulate cellular PI4KIIIα for its own RNA replication and virion production in the HCV life cycle. cDNA corresponding to the NS5A coding sequence of HCV was amplified by PCR using the Korean isolate of HCV (genotype 1b) and subcloned into the pEF6 vector (Invitrogen). Full-length PI4KIIIα was amplified by PCR using cDNAs prepared from Huh7.5 cells and cloned into pFLAG-CMV2 or p3XFLAG-CMV (Sigma). PI4KIIIα mutants were also constructed using full-length PI4KIIIα as a template. Plasmid pFK-Jc1 was kindly provided by Dr. Ralf Bartenschlager (University of Heidelberg). All cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagles' medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Huh7 cells harboring subgenomic replicon and IFN-cured cells were described previously (20Park C.Y. Jun H.J. Wakita T. Cheong J.H. Hwang S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 9237-9246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). For the transfection experiment, ∼5 × 105 cells plated on 60-mm dishes were transfected with plasmid DNA by using polyethyleneimine (Sigma) as described previously (10Park C.Y. Choi S.H. Kang S.M.

The infectious cell culture grown virus (HCVcc) was generated as described previously (21Kato T. Date T. Murayama A. Morikawa K. Akazawa D. Wakita T. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 2334-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Briefly, the monolayer of Huh7.5 cells was washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), trypsinized, and resuspended at a concentration of 6 × 106 cells/ml in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). After centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min, the cells were resuspended in 400 μl of cytomix solution containing 2 mm ATP and 5 mm glutathione, then mixed with 10 μg of Jc1 viral RNA, and electroporated using a Gene Pulser Xcell (Bio-Rad) in a 4-mm gap cuvette. Cell culture supernatants were collected 4 days after electroporation. Cross-linking of NS5A antibodies with Protein A Dynabeads (Dynal) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions using dimethyl pimelimidate dihydrochloride (Pierce). Whole cell extracts were incubated with NS5A antibodies cross-linked to Dynabead for 2 h at 4 °C on a rotator. After being washed three times with a lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm pheylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), the beads were resuspended in a sample buffer and heated for 5 min. The proteins were separated on 8% SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining. The interested protein bands were excised and analyzed by LC/MS/MS. The individual spectra from MS/MS were processed using TurboSEQUEST software (Thermo Quest, San Jose, CA). The generated peak list files were used to query either the MSDB data base or NCBI using the MASCOT program. Cells were lysed in 400 μl of cell lysis buffer A containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm pheylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cell lysates were further centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and the pellets were discarded. The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of proteins were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. Proteins were detected using an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). Rabbit anti-PI4KIIIα antibody was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Cells were harvested and lysed in cell lysis buffer A. The cell lysates were triturated by 10 passes through a 25-gauge needle on ice and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with anti-NS5A antibody, anti-PI4KIIIα antibody, anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma), and anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz), respectively. The samples were further incubated with 30 μl of protein A beads (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for 1 h. The beads were washed five times with cell lysis buffer A, and the bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and then detected by immunoblot analysis using corresponding secondary antibodies. Huh7.5 cells grown on coverglass were infected with HCVcc. At 2 days postinfection, cells were transfected with plasmid expressing FLAG-tagged PI4KIIIα. At 36 h after transfection, cells were washed in PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed three times in PBS and incubated in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) and 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then incubated with the primary antibodies (rabbit anti-NS5A antibody, mouse anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma), mouse anti-dsRNA antibody (J2, English and Scientific Consulting, respectively) for 2 h and further incubated with the secondary antibodies (FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, TRITC-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG, TRITC-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Inc.) for 1 h at room temperature. After two washes with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS and three washes in PBS, cells were analyzed using a Zeiss LSM700 laser confocal microscopy system. siRNAs targeting the PI4KIIIα, the HCV 5′-UTR (positive control), and the universal negative control, were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). siRNA transfection was performed using a Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA isolation from HCVcc-infected cells, cell culture medium, or replicon cells was performed using TRIzol® LS Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purified viral RNA was used as a template to synthesize cDNA using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) for 2 h at 42 °C. cDNA was amplified with HCV genotype 2a-specific primers (forward, AGA GCC ATA GTG GTC TGC GGA AC; reverse, CCT TTC GCA ACC CAA CGC TAC TC), HCV genotype 1b-specific primers (forward, ATC ACT CCC CTG TGA GGA ACT ACT G; reverse, CTG GAG GCT GCA CGA CAC TC), and actin-specific primers (forward, TGG ACT TCG AGC AAG AGA TGG; reverse, GGA AGG AAG GCT GGA AGA GTG). Quantification of HCV RNA was normalized with β-actin RNA as an internal control. All quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) experiments were done using an iQ5 multicolor real time PCR Detection system and built-in iQ5 optical systems software (Bio-Rad). To identify cellular proteins that interacted with the HCV NS5A protein, Huh7.5 cells were electroporated with HCV Jc1 RNA and cell lysates harvested 4 days after electroporation were immunoprecipitated with Dynabead cross-linked NS5A antibody. As a control, Huh7.5 cells were electroporated with HCV Jc1-GND RNA containing a replication-defective NS5B. Prior to detecting coimmunoprecipitated proteins, the specificity of NS5A antibody was confirmed by immunoprecipitation. We first confirmed the NS5A expression in Jc1 RNA-transfected cells and then verified the immunoprecipitation of Huh7.5 cell lysates with NS5A antibody (Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig. 1B, two cellular proteins were coprecipitated with NS5A protein in HCV RNA replicating cells but not in Jc1-GND cells. By LC/MS/MS analysis, the top band corresponding to the ∼250-kDa protein was identified as the PI4KIIIα. The bottom band corresponding to ∼40 kDa was identified as the hydroxyacid oxidase 2. To investigate the functional role of PI4KIIIα in HCV replication, we generated stable cells expressing either vector or PI4KIIIα. Huh7.5 cells stably expressing either p3XFLAG vector or p3XFLAG-PI4KIIIα were infected with HCVcc. Cell lysates harvested at 2 days after HCV infection were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. As demonstrated in Fig. 1C (top panels), the NS5A expression level was increased in all three PI4KIIIα stable cell lines. We confirmed that the HCV NS3 protein level was also elevated in PI4KIIIα stable cells (data not shown). To investigate the effect of PI4KIIIα on HCV release, qPCR was performed. As shown Fig. 1C (bottom panel), HCV release was significantly increased in PI4KIIIα stable cells as compared with vector stable cells. We further found that HCV release was also increased in the third clone of PI4KIIIα stable cells, confirming that this phenomenon was not caused by clonal selection (data not shown). To investigate how the PI4KIIIα protein was involved in HCV replication, we first examined the possible protein interaction between NS5A and PI4KIIIα by employing a coimmunoprecipitation assay using a transient expression system. Huh7.5 and HEK293T cells were either transfected with plasmid expressing NS5A protein of HCV genotype 1b or genotype 2a alone or cotransfected with plasmid expressing PI4KIIIα. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, NS5A derived from both genotypes 1b and 2a interacted with PI4KIIIα. To further confirm this result in the context of HCV replication, Huh7.5 cells infected with HCVcc were immunoprecipitated with NS5A antibody and then bound protein was immunoblotted with PI4KIIIα antibody. Fig. 2C showed that NS5A specifically interacted with PI4KIIIα in wild-type HCV-infected cells but not in mock-infected (GND) cells. To determine the region in PI4KIIIα responsible for NS5A binding, the interaction of NS5A with various deletion mutants of PI4KIIIα (Fig. 3A) was determined by a transfection-based coprecipitation assay. As shown in Fig. 3B (left top panel), NS5A interacted with a mutant encompassing aa 1–800 but not with aa 1–400 mutant of PI4KIIIα. To further narrow down the binding site for NS5A, we constructed more mutants and demonstrated that NS5A interacted with aa 401–600 residues of PI4KIIIα (Fig. 3B, left bottom and right top panels). Using serial deletion of 50 aa in each mutant construct, we precisely determined that aa 400–450 of PI4KIIIα was the most important residues responsible for binding with NS5A (Fig. 3B, right bottom panels). To examine functional implication of protein interaction between NS5A and PI4KIIIα, Huh7.5 cells were transfected with the mutant harboring either aa 1–800 or 401–800 of PI4KIIIα and then infected with HCVcc. A mutant harboring aa 1–400 of PI4KIIIα was used as a negative control. As shown in Fig. 3C (left top panel), NS5A protein expression levels were significantly decreased by both aa 1–800 and 401–800 of PI4KIIIα as compared with the aa 1–400 of PI4KIIIα. This was further confirmed by the significant decrease of HCV RNA levels in cells transfected with either aa 1–800 or 401–800 of PI4KIIIα as demonstrated by qPCR (Fig. 3C, left bottom panel). This was further confirmed in HCV replicon cells as demonstrated in Fig. 3C (right panels). These results indicated that protein interaction between NS5A and PI4KIIIα contributed to HCV replication because competitive interference by mutants harboring the binding domain of PI4KIIIα resulted in a significant decrease of viral RNA and protein expression levels. Next, we determined the region in NS5A responsible for PI4KIIIα binding. We constructed various domain mutants of NS5A as previously reported (22Tellinghuisen T.L. Marcotrigiano J. Gorbalenya A.E. Rice C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48576-48587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3D) and the binding domain was determined as described above. Fig. 3E (upper panel) showed that PI4KIIIα interacted with a mutant harboring domain I and a mutant harboring domains I and II but not with a mutant harboring domains II and III, indicating that PI4KIIIα interacted with NS5A through domain I of NS5A. Finally, we investigated whether the minimal PI4KIIIα (aa 400–600) could interact with the 1–213 (domain I) mutant of NS5A. Indeed, the 1–213 mutant of NS5A specifically interacted with aa 400–600 of PI4KIIIα, indicating that minimal sequences of both proteins were sufficient for protein interplay between PI4KIIIα and NS5A (Fig. 3E, bottom panel). To further analyze how PI4KIIIα contributed to HCV RNA replication, we conducted confocal microscopy to determine whether PI4KIIIα is part of the HCV RNA replication complex in HCV-infected cells. For this purpose, Huh7.5 cells infected with either HCVcc or mock were transfected with pFLAG-PI4KIIIα expression plasmid and subcellular localization was analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy using antibody against double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). We probed HCVcc-infected cells for the presence of dsRNA of the intermediate form of HCV RNA replication using a monoclonal antibody that recognizes dsRNA in a sequence-independent fashion. Fig. 4 shows that dsRNAs were observed as discrete foci localized mainly to the perinuclear region as reported previously (23Targett-Adams P. Boulant S. McLauchlan J. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 2182-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Dual staining of dsRNA and PI4KIIIα revealed that both proteins were co-localized in the cytoplasm as yellow fluorescence (top panels). This result indicates that PI4KIIIα is associated with the RNA replication complex. No dsRNA was labeled in mock-infected cells (data not shown). As expected, both NS5A and PI4KIIIα were co-localized to the same cellular compartment (second panels). Furthermore, NS5A, an essential element of the HCV RNA replication complex, and dsRNA were co-localized in the cytoplasm by dual staining (third panels). Collectively, these data suggest that PI4KIIIα is a component of the HCV RNA replication complex. To investigate the effect of the PI4KIIIα on HCV replication, HCV subgenomic replicon cells were transfected with the siRNA pool containing four siRNA constructs targeting different sites of PI4KIIIα. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay results showed that cell viability was not affected by siRNA transfection in replicon cells (data not shown). First, we tested the effect of PI4KIIIα on HCV protein expression. Fig. 5A demonstrated that silencing of PI4KIIIα dramatically decreased both NS5A and NS3 protein levels in replicon cells. It was noteworthy that the suppressive activity of PI4KIIIα siRNA was as efficient as positive siRNA (Fig. 5A, lane 2 versus lane 3). We then investigated the effect of PI4KIIIα on HCV RNA replication by qRT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 5B, the silencing of PI4KIIIα significantly reduced HCV RNA levels in HCV subgenomic replicon cells. HCV RNA levels were reduced ∼90% in cells transfected with PI4KIIIα-specific siRNAs as compared with the cells treated with the negative control siRNAs. This was further confirmed by RT-PCR (Fig. 5C). These data demonstrate that PI4KIIIα is necessary for HCV replication. To further investigate the effect of PI4KIIIα on HCV proliferation, Huh7.5 cells were transfected with 10 nm siRNA targeted to either PI4KIIIα or HCV. Huh7.5 cells were then infected with HCVcc and harvested at 2 days after infection. Both structural and nonstructural HCV proteins expressed in Huh7.5 cells were not affected by treatment of negative siRNA control (Fig. 6A, lane 1). However, the silencing of PI4KIIIα dramatically decreased the HCV protein expression levels as much as in cells treated with HCV-positive siRNA control (Fig. 6A, lane 2 versus lane 3). Because these cells showed no cytotoxicity for the transfected siRNA pool (Fig. 6B), the silencing effect was specific to PI4KIIIα in HCV-infected cells. We continued to examine RNA levels in both cells and tissue culture media by qRT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 6C, HCV RNA replication was remarkably blocked by knockdown of PI4KIIIα. Consequently, virion release was also decreased by ∼90% in cells transfected with PI4KIIIα-specific siRNA as compared with the negative control siRNA (Fig. 6D). We further confirmed that the HCV RNA level was almost undetectable in both cells and tissue culture medium by agarose gel analysis (Fig. 6E). Finally, we analyzed the effect of individual four PI4KIIIα siRNA on the HCV protein expression level. Huh7.5 cells were transfected with four different PI4KIIIα siRNA individually, and HCV protein expression levels were determined by immunoblot analysis. Fig. 6F showed that three individual siRNA worked as efficiently as the siRNA pool and each siRNA completely blocked HCV protein expression. We demonstrated that the suppression of HCV protein expressions (Fig. 6F, lane 3 versus lanes 4–6 in the top panel) was proportionate to the degree of PI4KIIIα silencing (Fig. 6F, 1 versus 2–4 in the bottom panel). These data suggest that PI4KIIIα plays a crucial role in HCV proliferation. HCV is the positive stranded RNA virus and its replication occurs on the membranous web in the cytoplasm (24Egger D. Wölk B. Gosert R. Bianchi L. Blum H.E. Moradpour D. Bienz K. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 5974-5984Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). HCV is largely dependent on cellular proteins for its own propagation. NS5A forms part of the HCV RNA replication complex (4Gosert R. Egger D. Lohmann V. Bartenschlager R. Blum H.E. Bienz K. Moradpour D. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 5487-5492Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). NS5A is a pleiotropic protein and has been shown to interact with various cellular proteins to modulate cell growth and cellular signaling pathways. To identify host factors necessary for HCV propagation, we employed a coimmunoprecipitation assay. Huh7.5 cells electroporated with Jc1 RNA were immunoprecipitated with NS5A antibody. By LC-MS/MS of the coprecipitated protein, PI4KIIIα was identified as one of the binding partners for NS5A in HCV replicating cells. PI4KIIIα interacted with NS5A derived from both genotypes 1b and 2a. We further demonstrated this interaction in Huh7.5 cells infected with HCV Jc1. PI4KIIIα is a lipid kinase that generates phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate. PI4KIIIα consists of an N-terminal SH3 domain, two proline-rich regions, two leucine zippers, pleckstrin homology domain, and the C-terminal catalytic domain (11Gehrmann T. Gülkan H. Suer S. Herberg F.W. Balla A. Vereb G. Mayr G.W. Heilmeyer Jr., L.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1437: 341-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). PI4KIIIα is localized primarily to the endoplasmic reticulum and implicated in membrane rearrangements. Because HCV replication occurs on the membranous web on lipid raft (6Gao L. Aizaki H. He J.W. Lai M.M. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 3480-3488Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 24Egger D. Wölk B. Gosert R. Bianchi L. Blum H.E. Moradpour D. Bienz K. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 5974-5984Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar), the interaction between PI4KIIIα and NS5A may serve as an important step for reorganizing cellular membrane-associated phospholipids to the HCV replication complex. Indeed, treatment of siRNAs in HCV-infected cells resulted in a remarkable decrease in HCV propagation. By siRNA library screening, it has been previously reported that PI4KIIIα was required for HCV replication (14Tai A.W. Benita Y. Peng L.F. Kim S.S. Sakamoto N. Xavier R.J. Chung R.T.

Gripon P. Le Seyec J. FASEB J. 2009; 23: 3780-3789Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). However, how PI4KIIIα was involved in HCV replication was poorly characterized. Whether PI4KIIIα is also involved in HCV entry and initial translation is controversial (15Berger K.L. Cooper J.D. Heaton N.S. Yoon R. Oakland T.E. Jordan T.X. Mateu G. Grakoui A. Randall G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 7577-7582Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 16Trotard M. Lepère-Douard C. Régeard M. Piquet-Pellorce C. Lavillette D. Cosset F.L. Gripon P. Le Seyec J. FASEB J. 2009; 23: 3780-3789Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). By coimmunoprecipitation assay using NS5A antibodies, we have shown that NS5A specifically interacted with PI4KIIIα. We further characterized the biological significance of this interaction between viral NS5A and cellular PI4KIIIα protein. NS5A contains a highly conserved C-terminal proline motif with the consensus sequence Pro-X-X-Pro-X-Arg that influences both RNA replication and viral assembly (26Hughes M. Gretton S. Shelton H. Brown D.D. McCormick C.J. Angus A.G. Patel A.H. Griffin S. Harris M. J. Virol. 2009; 83: 10788-10796Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This proline motif binds to the SH3 domains of the Src family kinase such as Fyn, Lyn, Hck, and Lck (27Macdonald A. Crowder K. Street A. McCormick C. Harris M. J. Gen. Virol. 2004; 85: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In addition, the proline motif of NS5A is a novel binding site for interacting with the SH3 domain of PI3K p85 (28Shelton H. Harris M. Virol. J. 2008; 5: 24Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Based on these reports, we speculated that the C-terminal domain of NS5A might interact with the SH3 domain in the N terminus of PI4KIIIα. However, the PI4KIIIα mutant lacking the SH3 domain still bound to the NS5A protein (data not shown). We demonstrated that NS5A interacted with PI4KIIIα through domain I of NS5A and aa 401–600 of PI4KIIIα. The functional role of the N-terminal region (∼aa 100–900), including the NS5A binding site of PI4KIIIα, is not yet well characterized. Because the N-terminal region encompassing aa 401–600 of PI4KIIIα is not present in other PI 4-kinases, this region may have a PI4KIIIα-specific function. Indeed, our studies demonstrated that protein interplay between this region and NS5A played an important role in HCV propagation. Interestingly, Ahn and co-workers (29Ahn J. Chung K.S. Kim D.U. Won M. Kim L. Kim K.S. Nam M. Choi S.J. Kim H.C. Yoon M. Chae S.K. Hoe K.L. J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 37: 741-748Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) previously reported that the C-terminal region encompassing aa 300–407 of NS5A interacted with a partial sequence harboring only the C-terminal catalytic domain (aa 1799–1916) of PI4KIIIα by yeast two-hybrid screening. Therefore, protein interaction regions are clearly quite different for both proteins. In the yeast two-hybrid screening by Ahn and co-workers (29Ahn J. Chung K.S. Kim D.U. Won M. Kim L. Kim K.S. Nam M. Choi S.J. Kim H.C. Yoon M. Chae S.K. Hoe K.L. J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 37: 741-748Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the identified gene was the partial sequence of PI4KIIIα. In addition, the N-terminal amphipathic helix region of NS5A was not included in the bait when the C-terminal catalytic domain of PI4KIIIα was identified in the yeast two-hybrid screen. It has been previously reported that the N-terminal amphipathic helix of NS5A-mediated membrane association and deletion of the amino-terminal 44 aa resulted in a nuclear translocation of the NS5A protein (30Brass V.

In our study, we identified full-length PI4KIIIα as a binding protein for NS5A in HCV replicating cells. We demonstrated that the NS5A and PI4KIIIα interaction promoted HCV propagation. The discrepancy of binding results between the two studies might be due to the differential cell system (yeast versus mammalian cells) and proteins or baits (intact protein in our study versus truncated protein by Ahn et al.

They further showed that this interaction was required for PI4KIIIα kinase activity. Collectively, we evaluated the impact of PI4KIIIα on viral replication in the HCV subgenomic replicon and the production of fully infectious HCV. We demonstrated that silencing of PI4KIIIα by siRNA resulted in a decrease of HCV replication in cells harboring the HCV subgenomic replicon. Furthermore, knockdown of PI4KIIIα prior to HCV infection blocked the release of infectious HCV into tissue culture medium. All these data suggest that HCV NS5A may hijack the host factor to build a viral replication complex for its own proliferation and thus PI4KIIIα may be a potential therapeutic target for HCV.

https://openalex.org/W1983072435,"Phosphatidylserine (PS) and oxidized PS species have been identified as key ligands on apoptotic cells important for their recognition and removal (efferocytosis) by phagocytes, a requisite step for resolution of inflammation. We have recently demonstrated that lysophosphatidylserine (lyso-PS) generated and retained on neutrophils following short term activation of the NADPH oxidase in vitro and in vivo enhanced their clearance via signaling through the macrophage G-protein-coupled receptor G2A. Here, we investigated the signaling pathway downstream of G2A. Lyso-PS, either made endogenously in apoptosing neutrophils or supplied exogenously in liposomes along with lyso-PS(neg) apoptotic cells, signaled to macrophages in a G2A-dependent manner for their enhanced production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) via a calcium-dependent cytosolic phospholipase A2/cyclooxygenase-mediated mechanism. Subsequent signaling by PGE2 via EP2 receptors activated macrophage adenylyl cyclase and protein kinase A. These events, in turn, culminated in enhanced activity of Rac1, resulting in an increase in both the numbers of macrophages efferocytosing apoptotic cells and the numbers of cells ingested per macrophage. These data were surprising in light of previous reports demonstrating that signaling by PGE2 and adenylyl cyclase activation are associated with macrophage deactivation and inhibition of apoptotic cell uptake. Further investigation revealed that the impact of this pathway, either the enhancement or inhibition of efferocytosis, was exquisitely sensitive to concentration effects of these intermediaries. Together, these data support the hypothesis that lyso-PS presented on the surface of activated and dying neutrophils provides a tightly controlled, proresolution signal for high capacity clearance of neutrophils in acute inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W1983438848,"An ATP-Mg(2+/)P(i) inner mitochondrial membrane solute transporter (SLC25A25), which is induced during adaptation to cold stress in the skeletal muscle of mice with defective UCP1/brown adipose tissue thermogenesis, has been evaluated for its role in metabolic efficiency. SLC25A25 is thought to control ATP homeostasis by functioning as a Ca(2+)-regulated shuttle of ATP-Mg(2+) and P(i) across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Mice with an inactivated Slc25a25 gene have reduced metabolic efficiency as evidenced by enhanced resistance to diet-induced obesity and impaired exercise performance on a treadmill. Mouse embryo fibroblasts from Slc25a25(-/-) mice have reduced Ca(2+) flux across the endoplasmic reticulum, basal mitochondrial respiration, and ATP content. Although Slc25a25(-/-) mice are metabolically inefficient, the source of the inefficiency is not from a primary function in thermogenesis, because Slc25a25(-/-) mice maintain body temperature upon acute exposure to the cold (4 °C). Rather, the role of SLC25A25 in metabolic efficiency is most likely linked to muscle function as evidenced from the physical endurance test of mutant mice on a treadmill. Consequently, in the absence of SLC25A25 the efficiency of ATP production required for skeletal muscle function is diminished with secondary effects on adiposity. However, in the absence of UCP1-based thermogenesis, induction of Slc25a25 in mice with an intact gene may contribute to an alternative thermogenic pathway for the maintenance of body temperature during cold stress."

https://openalex.org/W2010521434,"Previous studies have reported the functional characterization of 9 out of 11 genes found in the gene cluster responsible for biosynthesis of the polyketide pigment aurofusarin in Fusarium graminearum. Here we reanalyze the function of a putative aurofusarin pump (AurT) and the two remaining orphan genes, aurZ and aurS. Targeted gene replacement of aurZ resulted in the discovery that the compound YWA1, rather than nor-rubrofusarin, is the primary product of F. graminearum polyketide synthase 12 (FgPKS12). AurZ is the first representative of a novel class of dehydratases that act on hydroxylated γ-pyrones. Replacement of the aurS gene resulted in accumulation of rubrofusarin, an intermediate that also accumulates when the GIP1, aurF, or aurO genes in the aurofusarin cluster are deleted. Based on the shared phenotype and predicted subcellular localization, we propose that AurS is a member of an extracellular enzyme complex (GIP1-AurF-AurO-AurS) responsible for converting rubrofusarin into aurofusarin. This implies that rubrofusarin, rather than aurofusarin, is pumped across the plasma membrane. Replacement of the putative aurofusarin pump aurT increased the rubrofusarin-to- aurofusarin ratio, supporting that rubrofusarin is normally pumped across the plasma membrane. These results provide functional information on two novel classes of proteins and their contribution to polyketide pigment biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1998054523,"The widespread, long sought-after bacterial aerobic phenylalanine/phenylacetate catabolic pathway has recently been elucidated. It proceeds via coenzyme A (CoA) thioesters and involves the epoxidation of the aromatic ring of phenylacetyl-CoA, subsequent isomerization to an uncommon seven-membered C-O-heterocycle (oxepin-CoA), and non-oxygenolytic ring cleavage. Here we characterize the hydrolytic oxepin-CoA ring cleavage catalyzed by the bifunctional fusion protein PaaZ. The enzyme consists of a C-terminal (R)-specific enoyl-CoA hydratase domain (formerly MaoC) that cleaves the ring and produces a highly reactive aldehyde and an N-terminal NADP+-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase domain that oxidizes the aldehyde to 3-oxo-5,6-dehydrosuberyl-CoA. In many phenylacetate-utilizing bacteria, the genes for the pathway exist in a cluster that contains an NAD+-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase in place of PaaZ, whereas the aldehyde-producing hydratase is encoded outside of the cluster. If not oxidized immediately, the reactive aldehyde condenses intramolecularly to a stable cyclic derivative that is largely prevented by PaaZ fusion in vivo. Interestingly, the derivative likely serves as the starting material for the synthesis of antibiotics (e.g. tropodithietic acid) and other tropone/tropolone related compounds as well as for ω-cycloheptyl fatty acids. Apparently, bacteria made a virtue out of the necessity of disposing the dead-end product with ring hydrolysis as a metabolic branching point.

Apparently, bacteria made a virtue out of the necessity of disposing the dead-end product with ring hydrolysis as a metabolic branching point. Aromatics like phenylacetic acid constitute the second most abundant class of natural organic compounds that serve as substrates mainly for microorganisms. Oxygen availability is key to how bacteria utilize such inert substrates (1Fuchs G. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2008; 1125: 82-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Under aerobic conditions oxygen is used to hydroxylate and cleave the ring (2Butler C.S. Mason J.R. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1997; 38: 47-84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Gibson D.T. Parales R.E. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2000; 11: 236-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). In contrast, under anaerobic conditions the inert substrates become activated to CoA-thioesters followed by shortening of the side chain and energy-driven ring reduction; furthermore, ring cleavage occurs hydrolytically rather than by oxygenation. This strategy also applies to anaerobic phenylacetate catabolism (Ref. 4Boll M. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 921-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar and literature cited therein) (Fig. 1A). Phenylacetate (I) is a key intermediate in the degradation of various substrates like phenylalanine, lignin-related aromatic compounds, or environmental contaminants (5Luengo J.M. García J.L.

This novel metabolic strategy involves the usage of oxygen as well as CoA-thioester intermediates throughout the pathway, hence, showing typical features of aerobic as well as anaerobic strategies. Phenylacetyl-CoA (II) becomes epoxidized by PaaABC(D)E, a new type of bacterial multicomponent monooxygenase. The reactive and unstable epoxide intermediate (III) is further isomerized by enoyl-CoA isomerase PaaG to an unorthodox C-O heterocyclic enolether (IV), 2-oxepin-2(3H)-ylideneacetyl-CoA (oxepin-CoA). This is followed by PaaZ-mediated ring cleavage, and β-oxidation-like steps finally yield central intermediates (acetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA) (Fig. 1, A and B) (10Teufel R. Mascaraque V. Ismail W.

We addressed the question of how 50% of bacteria that utilize the pathway lack a gene for the multifunctional PaaZ in their paa gene cluster. Instead, a gene is present in the cluster whose product demonstrates aldehyde dehydrogenase activity but lacks hydratase activity, e.g. PacL from Aromatoleum aromaticum. To elucidate the unprecedented ring-cleavage reaction, we isolated and characterized recombinant PaaZ, performed 18O-labeling studies, and analyzed the products by mass spectrometry (MS). Furthermore, we identified by 13C NMR the spontaneous breakdown product of the reactive (PaaZ-ECH produced) aldehyde intermediate. A literature search indicated that this pathway is used by other microorganisms for the synthesis of various primary and secondary metabolites and signaling compounds.

The column was developed at a flow rate of 1 ml min−1 by a linear gradient from 2% acetonitrile in 40 mm ammonium acetate (pH 6.8) to 30% acetonitrile in the same buffer within 15 min. Elution was monitored with an UV diode array detector routinely at 260 nm. To observe the formation of ring-cleavage products, an enzymatic assay (0.3 ml) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 mm phenylacetyl-CoA, 2 mm NADPH, 1 mm NADP+, and 30 μg PaaG was started by the addition of 160 μg of PaaABC(D)E and stirred at 30 °C. A sample was taken after 2 min, before the assay was split and 1.5 μg of PaaZ or PaaZ-E256Q were added. Further samples were taken after additional incubation for 1.5 min. A similar assay (0.3 ml), which contained 1 mm NAD+ instead of NADP+, was incubated for 2 min, before the assay was split and incubated for additional 1.5 min with 35 μg of ECH-Aa or 35 μg of ECH-Aa and 41 μg of PacL. The assays were stopped by adding 1% formic acid to obtain pH 4.5. The samples were analyzed by RP-HPLC in an acetonitrile gradient as described above and detected at 260 nm. To show substrate consumption and product formation by PaaZ, PaaZ-E256Q, ECH-Aa, and PacL, reaction assays (0.2 ml) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.25 mm oxepin-CoA, and 1.5 mm NADP+ (for PaaZ/PaaZ-E256Q) or 1.5 mm NAD+ (for ECH-Aa/PacL) were started by the addition of 0.5 μg of PaaZ, 0.8 μg of PaaZ-E256Q, or 46 μg of ECH-Aa. For ECH-Aa, product formation was followed either in the absence or in the presence of (28 μg) PacL. Before the reactions were started, samples were incubated for 2 min without enzymes (except for PacL). Then, first samples were taken, and enzymes were added. Further samples were taken after 30, 60, 90, and 180 s. All samples were stopped and analyzed as described above. Samples of RP-HPLC fractions were transferred at 5 μl/min by a syringe pump into the nano-electrospray ionization source of a Finnigan LTQ-FT mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron Corp., Waltham, MA) for online mass detection assembled from a linear ion trap and an ion cyclotron (7 tesla magnet) with Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. Measurements covered the range of m/z from 600 to 1,300 at a resolution of 100,000. NMR spectra were measured at 10 °C using Bruker AVANCE 500 spectrometers equipped with an inverse HC probehead or a QNP cryoprobe. The lyophilized sample was dissolved in methanol-D4 directly before measurement. 13C,1H INADEQUATE, HSQC and HSQC-TOCSY experiments were measured using the pulse programs and experimental settings implemented in the TOPSPIN 3.0 software package. The mixing time in the HSQC-TOCSY was 60 ms. Due to the 13C enrichment of the [U-13C]phenylacetyl-CoA precursor, the one-dimensional 13C NMR spectrum of the product as well as the two-dimensional INADEQUATE, HSQC, and HSQC-TOCSY spectra were dominated by the signals due to the 13C-enriched positions. Signals of the unlabeled CoA-ester residue were clearly detected in the one-dimensional 1H NMR spectrum. Moreover, the presence of the thioester moiety was gleaned from the downfield shifts of the carbonyl-CoA atom (195 ppm). The multiple 13C-labeling was also conducive to scalar couplings between adjacent 13C atoms. The chemical shifts of the 13C-labeled moiety as well as the multiplicities, the coupling constants, and the correlation observed in the two-dimensional experiments are listed in Table 1. In combination with the mass data, the NMR chemical shifts, couplings, and correlations provided solid evidence for the proposed structure.TABLE 1NMR data of [U-13C8]2-hydroxycyclohepta-1,4,6-triene-1-formyl-CoA (VII)PositionChemical shiftsCoupling constantCorrelations observed in1H (HSQC)13CHSQCHSQC-TOCSYINADEQUATEppmHz1194.9 (d)61 (2)2110.1 (qua)62 (1, 3, 8)83166.4 (dd)44 (4), 69 (2)42.6733.9 (t)42 (3, 5)44, 5, 655.5119.7 (dd)38 (4), 67 (6)54, 5, 6, 7, 8666.21128.3 (m)ND64, 5, 6, 7, 8576.35124.9 (m)ND76, 7, 8886.87129.3 (m)ND85, 6, 7, 87, 2 Open table in a new tab The cloning procedures for paaZ from E. coli K12, paaABCDE/paaG from Pseudomonas sp. strain Y2, and boxD from Azoarcus evansii were described before (10Teufel R.

Chromosomal DNA from A. aromaticum was extracted using standard techniques. The genes for ech-Aa were amplified by PCR from chromosomal DNA using the forward primer 5′-GCTATGAATTCGCCAAAACGGGATGCAAG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CTATCGAAGCTTCAACTATCTTGACCCAGAGG-3′. Genes for pacL were amplified using forward primer 5′-GAGTGAATTCACCCATCCGCTGTTCG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CCGCAAGCTTGCACGGCGAGAGGCGTTAC-3′. Introduced restriction sites are underlined; the forward primers contained EcoR1 restriction sites replacing the start codon, and the reverse primers contained HindIII restriction sites. PCR was performed with Red Taq polymerase (Genaxxon) for 30 cycles, including denaturation for 45 s at 94 °C, annealing for 80 s at 65 °C (ech-Aa) or for 30 s at 68 °C (pacL), polymerization for 5 min at 72 °C, and a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. The PCR products were isolated and cloned into the expression vector pMAL-c2X (New England Biolabs), which adds a maltose-binding protein (MBP) to the N terminus of the expressed proteins. For mutation of paaZ from E. coli, a PCR was carried out with the pMAL-c2X-derived expression plasmid for PaaZ (10Teufel R. Mascaraque V. Ismail W. Voss M. Perera J. Eisenreich W. Haehnel W. Fuchs G.

Biochem. 2003; 319: 335-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). For this purpose, the primer 5′-CTTCACTATGCAAGCTGATTCCCTGAACTG-3′ was used, which contains a cytosine (shown in bold) instead of guanine, compared with native paaZ E. coli. PCR was performed with Phusion DNA polymerase (Finnzymes) for 25 cycles including denaturation for 10 s at 98 °C, annealing for 20 s at 65 °C, and polymerization for 4.5 min at 72 °C with a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. Expression with the mutated construct yielded PaaZ-E256Q. PaaABC(D)E, PaaG, and BoxD were produced as described before (10Teufel R. Mascaraque V. Ismail W. Voss M. Perera J. Eisenreich W. Haehnel W.

For overproduction of the heterologous proteins PaaZ, PaaZ-E256Q, PacL, and ECH-Aa, transformed E. coli DH5α cells were grown at 37 °C on lysogeny broth medium (19Bertani G. J. Bacteriol. 1951; 62: 293-300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with 100 μg of ampicillin ml−1 up to an A578 of 0.6 before induction with 0.5 mm isopropylthiogalactopyranoside. The temperature was lowered to 22 °C, and the cells were harvested after additional growth for 3 h and stored at −20 °C until use. PaaABC(D)E, PaaG, and BoxD were purified and stored as described before (10Teufel R. Mascaraque V. Ismail W. Voss M. Perera J. Eisenreich W. Haehnel W. Fuchs G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 2919-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The purifications of the other proteins were performed aerobically at 10 °C. For the preparation of cell extracts, one weight part of E. coli cells was suspended in one volume part of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 0.1 mg of DNase I ml−1 and 200 mm KCl. The suspension was passed twice through a cooled French pressure cell at 137 megapascals and centrifuged (100,000 × g) at 4 °C for 1 h. The supernatant (cell extract) was directly applied to an amylose resin column (New England Biolabs, volume 15 ml). The cell extract was applied at a flow rate of 1 ml min−1 to the amylose resin column, which had been equilibrated with buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mm KCl). After binding of the enzymes, the column was washed with 2 column volumes of buffer at a rate of 2 ml min−1. The enzymes were eluted with buffer containing 10 mm maltose and stored with 30% glycerol (v/v) at −20 °C. Enzyme fractions were analyzed by SDS-12.5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Proteins were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 staining. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. For photometric tests and RP-HPLC assays, oxepin-CoA was enzymatically synthesized and purified in a large scale assay. A reaction mixture (10 ml) contained 4 mg of PaaABC(D)E, 0.1 mg of PaaG, 1 mm NADPH, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 0.4 mm phenylacetyl-CoA. For MS analysis, the derivative 2-hydroxycyclohepta-1,4,6-triene-1-formyl-CoA was synthesized in an assay (0.3 ml) containing 0.03 mg PaaZ-E256Q, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 0.1 mm purified oxepin-CoA. For 13C NMR analysis of the derivative, a large scale assay (5 ml) was used to produce [U-13C]2-hydroxycyclohepta-1,4,6-triene-1-formyl-CoA. The reaction mixture contained 1.5 mm NADPH, 1 mg of PaaZ-E256Q, 3.5 mg of PaaABC(D)E, 0.2 mg of PaaG, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 1 mm [U-13C]phenylacetyl-CoA. All enzymatic assays were stirred for 5 min at 30 °C and stopped by adding 1% formic acid to obtain pH 4.5. The samples were centrifuged (14,000 × g) for 5 min at 4 °C. Unlabeled derivative was purified by HPLC and frozen in liquid nitrogen until MS measurement. The supernatants of the large scale assays were applied to C18-E columns (end-capped, bed size 200 mg, reservoir volume 3 ml, Phenomenex) that had been equilibrated with two reservoir volumes of 2% methanol in 20 mm ammonium acetate (pH 4.5). The columns were washed with 1 reservoir volume of equilibration buffer, and the reaction products were eluted with 1 reservoir volume 100% methanol. The methanol solutions were concentrated with a rotary evaporator at 50 millibar low pressure and 25 °C. The concentrates were loaded stepwise onto a C18-E column using RP-HPLC for separation. The respective peaks were collected, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, lyophilized, and kept frozen (−20 °C). The samples were dissolved in cold D2O or methanol-D4 directly before NMR measurement (for 13C-labeled 2-hydroxycyclohepta-1,4,6-triene-1-formyl-CoA) or in 10 mm MES-KOH (pH 4.5) (for oxepin-CoA) before use. All described enzymatic reactions were carried out at 22 °C, and at least two independent measurements were performed. A spectrophotometric assay was used for the measurement of PaaZ, in which the formation of NADPH was followed spectrophotometrically at 365 nm (ϵ365 nm for NADPH of 3500 m−1 cm−1). The reaction mixture (0.3 ml) contained 0.5 μg of PaaZ, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 1.0–1.5 mm NADP+ (or NAD+ to determine cofactor-specificity) and was started by the addition of 0.1 mm purified oxepin-CoA. The Km value for oxepin-CoA was determined by adding variable amounts of oxepin-CoA (10–100 μm) to the assay while keeping the NADP+ concentration constant (1.5 mm). The Km value for NADP+ was determined by adding variable amounts of NADP+ (0.3–3 mm) to the assay while keeping the oxepin-CoA concentration constant (0.1 mm). To determine the hydrolysis rate of oxepin-CoA through the ECH domain of PaaZ, a spectrophotometric assay with PaaZ-E256Q was used in which NADH formation through the auxiliary enzyme PacL was followed at 365 nm (ϵ365 nm for NADH of 3400 m−1 cm−1). The reaction mixture (0.3 ml) contained 0.5 μg of PaaZ-E256Q, an excess of 0.14 mg of PacL, 1.0 mm NAD+, and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and was started by the addition of 0.1 mm oxepin-CoA. A similar assay was used to measure ECH-Aa activity. The reaction mixture (0.3 ml) contained 0.03 mg of ECH-Aa, an excess of 0.4 mg of PacL, 1.0 mm NAD+, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and was started by the addition of 0.1 mm oxepin-CoA. This photometric assay was also used to determine the Km value of ECH-Aa for oxepin-CoA by recording the time course of complete NADH formation after addition of 0.1 mm oxepin-CoA followed by a graphic determination of the curve point at which half-maximal velocity was attained. To determine the pH optima of PaaZ and ECH-Aa, (N-(2-acetamido)-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid-tris-ethanolamine (ATE) buffer was used, which shows a constant ionic strength between pH 6 and 10 (22Ellis K.J. Morrison J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 405-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). The specific activities were compared in 0.5 steps between pH 6 to 10 by using the above described photometric assays. To determine the stereospecificity of the PaaZ-ECH and ECH-Aa catalyzed hydration, the backward dehydration reaction of 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA to crotonyl-CoA was measured in a coupled assay with crotonyl-CoA carboxylase/reductase as an auxiliary enzyme (23Erb T.J. Berg I.A. Brecht V. Müller M. Fuchs G. Alber B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 10631-10636Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures contained 1 mm NADPH, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.03 mg of crotonyl-CoA carboxylase/reductase, 40 mm NaHCO3 (as a source of CO2), 0.5 mm concentrations of either the (R)- or the (S)-enantiomer of 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA and 0.05 mg of PaaZ-E256Q or 0.24 mg of ECH-Aa, respectively. A spectrophotometric assay was used to measure the crotonyl-CoA hydration rate to (R)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA by PaaZ-ECH or ECH-Aa, respectively, in which the absorption decrease at 263 nm was quantified due to the removal of the enoyl-thioester bond (ϵ263 nm for the enoyl-thioester bond of 6700 m−1 cm−1 (24Binstock J.F. Schulz H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 71: 403-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar)). The assays (220 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1 mg of PaaZ or 0.03 μg of ECH-Aa and were started by the addition of 0.1–0.5 mm crotonyl-CoA. For PaaZ, also butyryl-CoA, β-methylcrotonyl-CoA, acryloyl-CoA, and methacryloyl-CoA were tested as substrates. A photometric test to measure PacL activity would require an excess of ECH-Aa or PaaZ-E256Q. This was not possible due to overlapping spectra of the derivative (which is inevitably formed once the labile semialdehyde accumulates) and NADH; therefore, a HPLC assay was used. The reaction mixture (100 μl) contained 1.0 mm NAD+, 0.2 mm oxepin-CoA, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1.3 μg of PaaZ-E256Q, and 2.8 μg of PacL. Samples (30 μl) were taken after 25, 50, and 75 s, and the reaction was immediately stopped by adding 1% formic acid to obtain pH 4.5 before denatured protein was removed by centrifugation. The supernatants were analyzed by RP-HPLC. The formation of 3-oxo-5,6-dehydrosuberyl-CoA was quantified by determining the relative peak areas of oxepin-CoA and 3-oxo-5,6-dehydrosuberyl-CoA at different time points. The product formation was plotted against time, and the specific activity was calculated based on the best-fit line. The same assay was used for determination of PacL cofactor specificity with NADP+ instead of NAD+ and also to determine BoxD activity by replacing PacL. To trap the reactive keto group of 3-oxo-5,6-dehydrosuberyl-CoA, a reaction mixture (0.4 ml) containing 1.5 mm NADPH, 1 mm NADP+, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.03 mg of PaaG, 0.1 mg of PaaZ, 0.32 mg of PaaABC(D)E, 0.7 mm phenylacetyl-CoA, and 10 mm phenylhydrazine was incubated for up to 30 min at 22 °C. Samples were taken after different incubation times, the reactions were stopped by adding 1% formic acid to obtain pH 4.5, and denatured protein was removed by centrifugation. The samples were analyzed by RP-HPLC. A new product eluting at 11.8 min was formed over time that was collected and analyzed by MS. Similarly, assays containing either 10 mm phenylhydrazine or semicarbazide failed in trapping the labile ring-cleavage product 3-oxo-5,6-dehydrosuberyl-CoA semialdehyde or the derivative 2-hydroxycyclohepta-1,4,6-triene-1-formyl-CoA. Furthermore, aliquots of the enzymatic assay were quenched after different reaction times in MES-HCl (pH 5.5), which contained 10 mm semicarbazide or phenylhydrazine followed by additional incubation for 10 min. Again, no derivatization product was detected. For H218O-labeling assays, reaction mixtures (0.3 ml) containing 0.2 mg PaaABC(D)E, 0.01 mg of PaaG, 0.01 mg of PaaZ, 1 mm NADPH, 1 mm NADP+, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 0.4 mm phenylacetyl-CoA were incubated in 1.5-ml reaction tubes with 50% H218O and 50% H216O (v/v). Alternatively, ECH-Aa (0.12 mg) and PacL (0.08 mg) were used instead of PaaZ. For 18O-labeling experiments a closed tube (total volume 7.5 ml) with 50% 18O2, 50% 16O2 (v/v) gas phase was used. The reaction assay (2.5 ml) contained 0.1 mg of PaaZ, 1 mm NADP+, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 0.2 mm oxepin-CoA. The assay mixtures were stirred at 30 °C for 3 min before the reactions were stopped by adding 1% formic acid to obtain pH 4.5, and denatured protein was removed by centrifugation. The prod"

In this work, we demonstrate that d-2HGDH localizes to plant mitochondria and that its expression increases gradually during developmental and dark-induced senescence in Arabidopsis thaliana, indicating an enhanced demand of respiration of alternative substrates through this enzymatic system under these conditions. Using loss-of-function mutants in d-2HGDH (d2hgdh1) and stable isotope dilution LC-MS/MS, we found that the d-isomer of 2HG accumulated in leaves of d2hgdh1 during both forms of carbon starvation. In addition to this, d2hgdh1 presented enhanced levels of most TCA cycle intermediates and free amino acids. In contrast to the deleterious effects caused by a deficiency in d-2HGDH in humans, d2hgdh1 and overexpressing lines of d-2HGDH showed normal developmental and senescence phenotypes, indicating a mild role of d-2HGDH in the tested conditions. Moreover, metabolic fingerprinting of leaves of plants grown in media supplemented with putative precursors indicated that d-2HG most probably originates during the catabolism of lysine.

In addition to high levels of 2HG, patients with 2HGA also have high concentrations of TCA cycle intermediates. On the other hand, excess accumulation of d-2HG contributes to the formation and malignant progression of brain tumors (3Dang L. White D.W. Gross S. Bennett B.D. Bittinger M.A. Driggers E.M.

Mutations in the cytosolic enzyme IDH1 (isocitrate dehydrogenase 1) occur in ∼80% of secondary brain cancer tumors and in nearly one-tenth of acute myelogenous leukemia tumors. Normally, IDH1 catalyzes the conversion of isocitrate to 2OG. Cancer-associated mutations in IDH1 reduce the affinity of the enzyme for isocitrate and increase the affinity for NADPH and 2OG. This prevents the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to 2OG and facilitates the conversion of 2OG to d-2HG. In this way, IDH1 mutations cause a gain of function, resulting in the production and accumulation of d-2HG (3Dang L. White D.W. Gross S. Bennett B.D. Bittinger M.A. Driggers E.M. Fantin V.R.

Chem. 1979; 254: 3259-3263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to this, it has been suggested that 2HG is the end product of a sequence involving glutamate via 2OG in yeast (10Albers E. Gustafsson L. Niklasson C. Lidén G. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 1683-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).Despite the fact that the involvement of d-2HG in metabolism in mammals and bacteria is known, the participation of this metabolite in plant metabolism was so far poorly understood. Recently, we identified the d-2HGDH from Arabidopsis thaliana and characterized it at the biochemical level (11Engqvist M. Drincovich M.F. Flügge U.I. Maurino V.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 25026-25037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This enzyme catalyzes the exclusive conversion of d-2HG to 2OG, which can enter the TCA cycle, whereas electrons are transferred to the electron transport chain through the ETF-ETFQO complex (1Struys E.A. Salomons G.S. Achouri Y. Van Schaftingen E. Grosso S. Craigen W.J. Verhoeven N.M. Jakobs C. Am. J. Hum.

As gene coexpression analysis indicated that d-2HGDH is in the same network as several genes involved in β-oxidation and degradation of amino acids and chlorophyll, it was proposed that d-2HGDH participates in the catabolism of d-2HG most probably during the mobilization of alternative substrates from proteolysis and/or lipid degradation (11Engqvist M.

Metabolic analysis of loss-of-function mutants (d2hgdh1) growing in media supplemented with different metabolites indicated that d-2HG would form from the free amino acid lysine. We also demonstrate that d-2HG accumulates in leaves of d2hgdh1 during natural senescence and dark-induced carbon starvation and that plants overexpressing d-2HGDH accumulate less d-2HG during the course of senescence. The metabolic and phenotypic analysis of these plants indicated a mild role of d-2HGDH in plant metabolism in the tested conditions. Moreover, the data obtained suggest fundamental differences between plants and human d-2HG metabolism both in the origin of this metabolite and how these organisms can cope with high levels of it.

In addition to high levels of 2HG, patients with 2HGA also have high concentrations of TCA cycle intermediates. On the other hand, excess accumulation of d-2HG contributes to the formation and malignant progression of brain tumors (3Dang L. White D.W. Gross S. Bennett B.D. Bittinger M.A. Driggers E.M.

Mutations in the cytosolic enzyme IDH1 (isocitrate dehydrogenase 1) occur in ∼80% of secondary brain cancer tumors and in nearly one-tenth of acute myelogenous leukemia tumors. Normally, IDH1 catalyzes the conversion of isocitrate to 2OG. Cancer-associated mutations in IDH1 reduce the affinity of the enzyme for isocitrate and increase the affinity for NADPH and 2OG. This prevents the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to 2OG and facilitates the conversion of 2OG to d-2HG. In this way, IDH1 mutations cause a gain of function, resulting in the production and accumulation of d-2HG (3Dang L. White D.W. Gross S. Bennett B.D. Bittinger M.A. Driggers E.M. Fantin V.R.

We report here the crystal structure of serine acetyltransferase (SAT) isoform 1, a cysteine biosynthetic pathway enzyme from E. histolytica (EhSAT1) at 1.77 Å, in complex with its substrate serine (Ser) at 1.59 Å and inhibitor Cys at 1.78 Å resolution. EhSAT1 exists as a trimer both in solution as well as in crystal structure, unlike hexamers formed by other known SATs. The difference in oligomeric state is due to the N-terminal region of the EhSAT1, which has very low sequence similarity to known structures, also differs in orientation and charge distribution. The Ser and Cys bind to the same site, confirming that Cys is a competitive inhibitor of Ser. The disordered C-terminal region and the loop near the active site are responsible for solvent-accessible acetyl-CoA binding site and, thus, lose inhibition to acetyl-CoA by the feedback inhibitor Cys. Docking and fluorescence studies show that EhSAT1 C-terminal-mimicking peptides can bind to O-acetyl serine sulfhydrylase (EhOASS), whereas native C-terminal peptide does not show any binding. To test further, C-terminal end of EhSAT1 was mutated and found that it inhibits EhOASS, confirming modified EhSAT1 can bind to EhOASS. The apparent inability of EhSAT1 to form a hexamer and differences in the C-terminal region are likely to be the major reasons for the lack of formation of the large cysteine synthase complex and loss of a complex regulatory mechanism in E. histolytica.

IntroductionIn bacteria and plants, l-cysteine is synthesized from l-Serine by two key enzymes serine acetyltransferase (SAT) 3The abbreviations used are: SAT, serine acetyltransferase; OASS, O-acetyl serine (OAS) sulfhydrylase; DTNB, 5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid); PLP, pyridoxal-5′-phosphate; TNB, 5-thio(2-nitrobenzoate); Ec-, E. coli; Hi-, H. influenzae; Eh, E. histolytica; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. and O-acetyl serine sulfhydrylase (OASS). SAT converts l-Serine to O-acetyl serine by transferring an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA. Later, OASS converts the O-acetyl serine (OAS) to l-cysteine by adding a sulfide. This cysteine biosynthetic pathway contributes significantly to the incorporation of inorganic sulfur into organic compounds. SAT is in low abundance compared with OASS and is the rate-limiting component in this pathway (1Smith I.K. Thompson J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 227: 288-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).The intracellular level of Cys is maintained by complex kinetics and strictly regulated by two known mechanisms. In the first, SAT is inhibited by Cys through a feedback mechanism. The second mechanism involves association of SAT and OASS to form a cysteine synthase complex. In the complex form, SAT activity increases, whereas OASS activity is reduced (2Saito K. Yokoyama H. Noji M. Murakoshi I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16321-16326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This results in excess production of OAS, which causes the dissociation of the cysteine synthase complex and subsequent down-regulation of SAT activity (3Kredich N.M. Becker M.A. Tomkins G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 2428-2439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The structures of SAT from Escherichia coli (EcSAT) and Haemophilus influenzae (HiSAT) have been reported (4Pye V.E.

Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1600-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and also in complex with cysteine and acetyl-CoA (6Olsen L.R. Huang B. Vetting M.W. Roderick S.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6013-6019Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These structures exist as hexamers in the form of dimer of trimers. The solution studies and structures of OASS reveal that it stays as a dimer (7Krishna C. Jain R. Kashav T. Wadhwa D. Alam N. Gourinath S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2007; 63: 512-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 8Becker M.A. Kredich N.M. Tomkins G.M. J. Biol.

Proteins. 2008; 72: 1222-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Biochemical and modeling studies indicated that one SAT hexamer and two OASS dimers interact to form the cysteine synthase complex (10Feldman-Salit A. Wirtz M. Hell R. Wade R.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 386: 37-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The molecular details of the cysteine synthase complex are still not very clear. Various biochemical and structural studies have revealed that C-terminal end of SAT interacts with the active site of OASS (11Zhao C. Moriga Y. Feng B. Kumada Y. Imanaka H. Imamura K. Nakanishi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 341: 911-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 27Denk D. Böck A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1987; 133: 515-525PubMed Google Scholar).Entamoeba histolytica is the enteric protozoan parasite that causes amoebic colitis and extra-intestinal abscesses in approximately 50 million people and kills about 70,000 each year (12WHO/PAHO/UNESCO Epidemiol. Bull. 1997; 18: 13-14Google Scholar). Cysteine was reported as the major thiol in E. histolytica (13Nozaki T. Asai T. Kobayashi S. Ikegami F. Noji M. Saito K. Takeuchi T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 97: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and is assumed to play a major role in oxidative stress defense mechanisms in this glutathione-deficient organism. Cysteine has also been shown to be necessary for survival, growth, elongation, and attachment to matrix (14Nozaki T. Asai T. Sanchez L.B. Kobayashi S. Nakazawa M. Takeuchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32445-32452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 15Nozaki T. Ali V. Tokoro M. Adv. Parasitol. 2005; 60: 1-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The cysteine biosynthetic pathway could be crucial target to develop new chemotherapeutics (16Agarwal S.M. Jain R. Bhattacharya A. Azam A. Int. J. Parasitol. 2008; 38: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Similar to other bacteria and plants, l-cysteine is synthesized by serine acetyltransferase (EhSAT) and O-acetyl serine sulfhydrylase (EhOASS) in E. histolytica. But unlike in other bacteria and plants, EhSAT and EhOASS do not interact with each other and do not form the cysteine synthase complex (14Nozaki T. Asai T. Sanchez L.B. Kobayashi S. Nakazawa M. Takeuchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32445-32452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).The fact that the E. histolytica genome encodes three forms of SAT suggests the importance of this enzyme for its survival. The EhSAT1 and EhSAT2 isoforms are very similar (78% identity), whereas the EhSAT3 isoform has very low sequence homology with EhSAT1 and EhSAT2 (48% identity). These three isoforms show differences in sensitivity to the feedback inhibitor l-cysteine (17Hussain S. Ali V. Jeelani G. Nozaki T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2009; 163: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Till now there is no structural information available as to how sensitivity for feedback inhibition of cysteine is lost for some mutants/isoforms and why cysteine synthase complex does not form in E. histolytica.Here for the first time we report the structure of EhSAT at 1.77 Å resolution as well as its structure bound with its substrate serine at 1.59 Å resolution and its inhibitor cysteine at 1.78 Å resolution. EhSAT1 in these structures is trimeric rather than hexameric. The structures with Ser and Cys indicate how Cys can be a competitive inhibitor with Ser and does not inhibit acetyl-CoA. The docking and fluorescence binding studies with EhOASS clearly show that if the EhSAT1 had different C-terminal sequence, EhSAT1 and EhOASS could interact with each other. The C-terminal mutant of EhSAT1 does inhibit EhOASS, confirming our docking studies. These new structural features and biochemical studies suggest abolition of cysteine synthase complex formation to ensure ample supply of cysteine for the survival of the organism.DISCUSSIONSequence comparison of EhSAT1 with other SATs shows very high diversity in the N-terminal domain region (supplemental Fig. 2). The structure of N-terminal domain is helix-rich, with eight helices, which is similar to EcSAT and HiSAT. However, the overall orientation of the N-terminal domain is completely different in comparison with EcSAT/HiSAT (see details below). The C-terminal domain sequence and structure is well conserved with a typical left-handed five-coil β-helix domain. This domain also includes the active site, which is located between dimeric interfaces near the third coil (Fig. 1). The loop near the third coil is partly disordered, and three residues could not be built even after reducing the electron density to 0.5δ level. The active site in the native structure is occupied with a sulfate ion making interactions with Arg-222, His-223, His-208, and a water molecule.Comparison with Other SAT StructuresThis is the first time any serine acetyltransferase was observed as a trimer in both solution as well as in the crystal structure. Both EcSAT and HiSAT were observed as hexamers in crystal structures (4Pye V.E. Tingey A.P. Robson R.L. Moody P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40729-40736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 5Gorman J. Shapiro L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1600-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) as well as in electron microscopic images (28Hindson V.J. Moody P.C. Rowe A.J. Shaw W.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 461-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), where two trimers interact with each other in 2-fold axis symmetry. Otherwise, the overall architecture of each protomer of EhSAT1 is similar to each protomer of EcSAT (r.m.s.d. of 1.04 Å for 166 residues) and HiSAT (r.m.s.d. of 1.03 Å for 165 residues). All the protomers consist of helix-rich N-terminal domain and left-handed parallel β-helix containing C-terminal domain. The structure of the C-terminal domain is highly similar in the different isoforms; this region is also conserved and contains the active site. Active sites are located between two adjacent C-terminal domains of trimer, amounting to three active sites for each trimer. In contrast, about 100 residues of the N-terminal domain of EhSAT1 are quite different compared with EcSAT (Fig. 4A) and HiSAT (Fig. 4B). The major difference begins at about residue 97, between helix 4 and helix 5 (Fig. 4 and supplemental Fig. 2). In EcSAT and HiSAT, a small loop connects these helices, whose axes are oriented about 55° relative to one another. In EhSAT1, helix 4 and 5 are almost continuous, with just a kink near Pro-97 between them. The N-terminal region also differs due to the insertion of 7 residues (80–86) in EhSAT1 compared with EcSAT/HiSAT (supplemental Fig. 2). In EhSAT1, Cys-88 and Cys-145 are in close proximity (3.81 Å) to each other and can form a disulfide bridge. This kind of disulfide bridge is not possible in other SATs, as these residues are not conserved.The N-terminal domain appears to determine the oligomeric state of SAT. The r.m.s.d. between N-terminal domain of EhSAT with EcSAT and HiSAT is 8.2 and 6.42 Å, respectively (Fig. 4). As noted above, the N-terminal region of EhSAT1 has very low sequence similarity with other SATs. The first 100 residues of the N-terminal domain have no sequence similarity with EcSAT and HiSATs. Moreover, there is an insertion of about eight residues in the middle of N-terminal domain of EhSAT1. Although the number of helices is the same in the N-terminal domain of all SAT structures, the orientation of first four helices is quite different. In contrast to HiSAT and especially EcSAT, where the N-terminal domains from the trimeric portion of the oligomer form a quite symmetrical triangle, the arrangement is relatively asymmetric in EhSAT1 (Fig. 5). Moreover, in contrast to the relatively hydrophobic surface of the trimer in EcSAT/HiSAT, which appears to drive a dimerization of trimers, the same surface in EhSAT1 is relatively charged. Taken together, these structural differences may be the reason that EhSAT1 does not form a hexamer.FIGURE 5The charge distribution on the surfaces of EcSAT (a), HiSAT (b), and EhSAT1 (c) molecules from the N-terminal side view of trimers on space filled models. EcSAT and HiSAT have more hydrophobic surface compared with EhSAT1 and may be responsible for two trimers of EcSAT and HiSAT to interact and form hexamers.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Differences in Acetyl-CoA Binding SiteThe loop near the third coil, which is part of the active site, has an eight-amino acid-long insertion unique to EhSAT1 as compared with EcSAT and HiSAT. This insertion could influence the activity of the enzyme and the interactions with the C-terminal region. In the HiSAT-Cys complex structure, Thr-181 of loop3, near the active site, forms a hydrogen bond with Gln-254 of the C-terminal region of the next molecule (supplemental Fig. 3). In this structure, the C-terminal region is well traced up to residue 257, and only 10 residues are disordered at the C-terminal end. In HiSAT-Co-A complex structure, Thr-181 interacts with Co-A and, thus, cannot interact with the C-terminal Gln-254; due to this, the C-terminal region was unstable and could not be traced in the structure (6Olsen L.R. Huang B. Vetting M.W. Roderick S.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6013-6019Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). But in the case of EhSAT1, neither Thr nor Gln is conserved in the sequence, and other residues do not compensate for these interactions. This lack of interactions of C-terminal region may be responsible for it being highly disordered in all EhSAT1 structures. Thus, the acetyl-CoA binding site is open and accessible in all three structures of EhSAT1 including the EhSAT1-Cys complex structure.Mutation of Met-256 in E. coli SAT to Ile makes the enzyme less susceptible to cysteine inhibition (27Denk D. Böck A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1987; 133: 515-525PubMed Google Scholar). Several amino acids around Met-256 are thought be involved in the conformational changes necessary for cysteine inhibition sensitivity (29Mino K. Yamanoue T. Sakiyama T. Eisaki N. Matsuyama A. Nakanishi K. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1999; 63: 168-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 30Mino K. Yamanoue T. Sakiyama T. Eisaki N. Matsuyama A. Nakanishi K. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2000; 64: 1628-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Met at this position is not conserved in EhSAT1, and this region in the structures of EhSAT1 is not stable and could not be traced, but this enzyme was shown to be sensitive to cysteine by competitive inhibition (17Hussain S. Ali V. Jeelani G. Nozaki T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2009; 163: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In EhSAT1, competitive inhibition by Cys might be simply due to just competing to the binding site and the binding energy differences between Cys and Ser.In the case of HiSAT, it is clearly observed that in the Cys-bound structure, the C-terminal end of the protein interacts with the third β-coil and buries the acetyl-CoA binding site (6Olsen L.R. Huang B. Vetting M.W. Roderick S.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6013-6019Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. 3), thus, causing complex kinetics in which Cys appears to compete with acetyl-CoA (31Kredich N.M. Tomkins G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 4955-4965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Table 3). It may be noted that the inhibition constant, Ki(Cys) for EcSAT is quite low compared with EhSAT1, as the C-terminal region must also be involved in EcSAT inhibition covering the acetyl-CoA binding site, but it is not involved in EhSAT1. In the case of EcSAT/HiSAT, the inhibition is a combined effect of Cys competition at the active site and allosteric binding of the C-terminal region near the active site by burying the acetyl-CoA binding site. Note that the loop of the third coil and the C-terminal end of EhSAT1 are quite different compared with EcSAT and HiSAT. There are no interactions between these regions in EhSAT1, which were observed in the HiSAT structure. In the case of EhSAT1, the kinetics should be mere competitive inhibition of Cys to Ser and should not have any effect on acetyl-CoA kinetics, and this is clearly observed in kinetic studies reported by Hussain et al. (17Hussain S. Ali V. Jeelani G. Nozaki T. Mol. Biochem.

Commun. 2006; 341: 911-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), where Ile is present at the C-terminal end. Although the EhSAT1 has Ile at the C-terminal end, it has been reported that it will not interact with EhOASS (13Nozaki T. Asai T. Kobayashi S. Ikegami F. Noji M. Saito K. Takeuchi T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 97: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 14Nozaki T. Asai T. Sanchez L.B. Kobayashi S. Nakazawa M. Takeuchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32445-32452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To investigate further, we got peptide “SPSI” derived from the EhSAT1 C-terminal sequence and tested for binding and inhibition studies of EhOASS. The peptide SPSI showed about 30% competitive inhibition but did not show any noticeable change in PLP fluorescence, indicating that it does not bind strongly to EhOASS active site. To further understand the reason for the loss of interactions between these proteins, we generated a library of tetra-peptides mimicking the C-terminal sequence of SAT by keeping Ile at the end, and docking studies were performed to the active site of EhOASS.Docking studies of SAT C-terminal mimicking peptides with EhOASS structure suggested that several peptides could have better binding energy than the EhSAT1-derived C-terminal peptide, SPSI. Five peptides that have best binding energy to EhOASS were obtained and studied for the inhibition activity and binding affinity against the EhOASS. Three peptides, DFSI, DWSI, and DYSI, show better inhibition and binding affinity against the EhOASS compared with SPSI. It may be noted that DFSI is the C-terminal sequence of M. tuberculosis SAT. The docking studies suggest that the Asp and aromatic amino acid makes several interactions with the EhOASS active site cavity. It appears that if the C-terminal end of EhSAT1 had any of these peptide sequences (DFSI/DWSI/DYSI), then the EhSAT1 would have interacted with EhOASS to form a multienzyme complex. But this multienzyme complex would not be a decamer as observed in other cysteine synthase complexes because the SAT in other organisms is a hexamer and EhSAT1 is a trimer.Earlier, we proposed on the basis of EhOASS structure that the C-terminal-end helix of EhOASS may be responsible for loss of EhOASS and EhSAT1 interactions (9Chinthalapudi K. Kumar M. Kumar S. Jain S. Alam N. Gourinath S. Proteins. 2008; 72: 1222-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), as this helix was in a completely different orientation compared with other OASS structures, and also, it covered a groove near the active site. But binding studies with the C-terminal mimicking peptides of SAT to EhOASS clearly shows that the loss of interactions is mainly due to differences in the C-terminal residues of EhSAT.C-terminal-modified EhSAT1 (DWSI-EhSAT1) Inhibits EhOASS EfficientlyIt is known from earlier studies that EhSAT1 does not interact with EhOASS (13Nozaki T. Asai T. Kobayashi S. Ikegami F. Noji M. Saito K. Takeuchi T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 97: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 14Nozaki T. Asai T. Sanchez L.B. Kobayashi S. Nakazawa M. Takeuchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32445-32452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The inhibition and binding studies of EhOASS with EhSAT1-derived peptide SPSI also showed that SPSI does bind to the EhOASS active site, confirming earlier studies. But different SAT C-terminal mimicking peptides, especially DWSI, showed better inhibition of EhOASS and also high binding affinity. We wanted to check if the C terminus of EhSAT1 was mutated to DWSI, would this mutant protein bind to EhOASS? As expected, the EhOASS activity was inhibited by about 62% in the presence of DWSI-EhSAT1, suggesting that if a different C-terminal sequence was present in EhSAT1, it could have interacted with EhOASS, and E. histolytica could have a complex regulatory cysteine synthesis mechanism.Implications on E. histolyticaE. histolytica is deficient of catalase and glutathione systems, which are generally involved in antioxidative mechanisms in many organisms. Cysteine was shown to be the major thiol involved in antioxidative defense of E. histolytica, and it also plays a vital role in the survival of this organism including adherence to matrix, elongation, motility, and growth (13Nozaki T. Asai T. Kobayashi S. Ikegami F. Noji M. Saito K. Takeuchi T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 97: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The EhSAT1 structure reveals that E. histolytica has evolved in a way that the complex regulatory mechanisms are turned off with a simple modification of the N-terminal and C-terminal regions and an insertion in the loop near the active site that still maintained its enzyme activity. The variations in the C-terminal region and insertion in the third coil loop near the active site leads to an exposed acetyl-CoA binding site, as the C-terminal region in EhSAT1 does not cover this region. Thus, Cys binding does not inhibit the acetyl-CoA binding and competes only with Ser for the active site. Differences in the N-terminal region of EhSAT1 compared with that of other SATs lead to trimer formation and loss of hexamer forming ability. This trimer in turn cannot form a large decameric cysteine synthase complex (hexamer of SAT and two dimers of OASS), thus, leading to the loss of OAS and sulfide regulation on this pathway. The pathway is simply regulated by feedback inhibition of Cys, thus, making sure that the organism has enough Cys to protect from oxidative stress.ConclusionEhSAT1 exists as a trimer both in solution and in crystal structure. The differences in the N-terminal domain and its charge distribution may be responsible for not forming hexamers as seen in EcSAT and HiSAT.The C-terminal end and third β-coil loop, which are quite different from EcSAT and HiSAT, do not interact with each other in the EhSAT1-Cys complex structure, making the acetyl-CoA binding site solvent-accessible. These differences are responsible for loss of inhibition kinetics to acetyl-CoA by Cys. Ser and Cys bind to almost the same location in the active site, with minor differences, clearly indicating that Cys inhibits SAT by competitive inhibition with Ser. In EcSAT and HiSAT, the Cys inhibits both acetyl-CoA binding as well as serine binding, whereas Cys just competitively inhibits Ser binding to EhSAT1, which is clearly explained by the EhSAT-Cys complex structure.Even though Ile is there at the C-terminal end, EhSAT1 cannot bind strongly with the EhOASS active site. If the C-terminal of EhSAT1 had ended with DXSI (X is any aromatic amino acid), instead of SPSI, EhSAT1 could have interacted with EhOASS strongly and could have formed a multienzyme complex. But this multienzyme complex would have been a pentamer rather than a decamer, as observed in other organisms. This loss of a complex regulatory mechanism (explained here by structural features that abolish hexamer formation, by Cys not inhibiting acetyl-CoA binding, and by cysteine synthase complex formation) ensure that there is enough Cys available in the E. histolytica for its survival. IntroductionIn bacteria and plants, l-cysteine is synthesized from l-Serine by two key enzymes serine acetyltransferase (SAT) 3The abbreviations used are: SAT, serine acetyltransferase; OASS, O-acetyl serine (OAS) sulfhydrylase; DTNB, 5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid); PLP, pyridoxal-5′-phosphate; TNB, 5-thio(2-nitrobenzoate); Ec-, E. coli; Hi-, H. influenzae; Eh, E. histolytica; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. and O-acetyl serine sulfhydrylase (OASS). SAT converts l-Serine to O-acetyl serine by transferring an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA. Later, OASS converts the O-acetyl serine (OAS) to l-cysteine by adding a sulfide. This cysteine biosynthetic pathway contributes significantly to the incorporation of inorganic sulfur into organic compounds. SAT is in low abundance compared with OASS and is the rate-limiting component in this pathway (1Smith I.K. Thompson J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 227: 288-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).The intracellular level of Cys is maintained by complex kinetics and strictly regulated by two known mechanisms. In the first, SAT is inhibited by Cys through a feedback mechanism. The second mechanism involves association of SAT and OASS to form a cysteine synthase complex. In the complex form, SAT activity increases, whereas OASS activity is reduced (2Saito K. Yokoyama H. Noji M. Murakoshi I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16321-16326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This results in excess production of OAS, which causes the dissociation of the cysteine synthase complex and subsequent down-regulation of SAT activity (3Kredich N.M. Becker M.A. Tomkins G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 2428-2439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The structures of SAT from Escherichia coli (EcSAT) and Haemophilus influenzae (HiSAT) have been reported (4Pye V.E.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6013-6019Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These structures exist as hexamers in the form of dimer of trimers. The solution studies and structures of OASS reveal that it stays as a dimer (7Krishna C. Jain R. Kashav T. Wadhwa D. Alam N. Gourinath S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst.

Pin1 expression was found to be up-regulated upon the induction of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, and the forced expression of Pin1 with defined reprogramming factors was observed to further enhance the frequency of iPS cell generation. The inhibition of Pin1 activity significantly suppressed colony formation and induced the aberrant differentiation of human iPS cells as well as murine ES cells. We further found that Pin1 interacts with the phosphorylated Ser12-Pro motif of Oct4 and that this in turn facilitates the stability and transcriptional activity functions of Oct4. Our current findings thus uncover an atypical role for Pin1 as a putative regulator of the induction and maintenance of pluripotency via the control of phosphorylation signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2041011334,"Pathogenic bacteria acquire the essential element iron through specialized uptake pathways that are necessary in the iron-limiting environments of the host. Members of the Gram-negative Neisseriaceae and Pasteurellaceae families have adapted to acquire iron from the host iron binding glycoprotein, transferrin (Tf), through a receptor complex comprised of transferring-binding protein (Tbp) A and B. Because of the critical role they play in the host, these surface-exposed proteins are invariably present in clinical isolates and thus are considered prime vaccine targets. The specific interactions between TbpB and Tf are essential and ultimately might be exploited to create a broad-spectrum vaccine. In this study, we report the structure of TbpBs from two porcine pathogens, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and suis. Paradoxically, despite a common Tf target, these swine related TbpBs show substantial sequence variation in their Tf-binding site. The TbpB structures, supported by docking simulations, surface plasmon resonance and hydrogen/deuterium exchange experiments with wild-type and mutant TbpBs, explain why there are structurally conserved elements within TbpB homologs despite major sequence variation that are required for binding Tf."
https://openalex.org/W2006645677,"Hantaviruses, members of the Bunyaviridae family, are negative-stranded emerging RNA viruses and category A pathogens that cause serious illness when transmitted to humans through aerosolized excreta of infected rodent hosts. Hantaviruses have evolved a novel translation initiation mechanism, operated by nucleocapsid protein (N), which preferentially facilitates the translation of viral mRNAs. N binds to the ribosomal protein S19 (RPS19), a structural component of the 40 S ribosomal subunit. In addition, N also binds to both the viral mRNA 5' cap and a highly conserved triplet repeat sequence of the viral mRNA 5' UTR. The simultaneous binding of N at both the terminal cap and the 5' UTR favors ribosome loading on viral transcripts during translation initiation. We characterized the binding between N and RPS19 and demonstrate the role of the N-RPS19 interaction in N-mediated translation initiation mechanism. We show that N specifically binds to RPS19 with high affinity and a binding stoichiometry of 1:1. The N-RPS19 interaction is an enthalpy-driven process. RPS19 undergoes a conformational change after binding to N. Using T7 RNA polymerase, we synthesized the hantavirus S segment mRNA, which matches the transcript generated by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase in cells. We show that the N-RPS19 interaction plays a critical role in the translation of this mRNA both in cells and rabbit reticulocyte lysates. Our results demonstrate that the N-mediated translation initiation mechanism, which lures the host translation machinery for the preferential translation of viral transcripts, primarily depends on the N-RPS19 interaction. We suggest that the N-RPS19 interaction is a novel target to shut down the N-mediated translation strategy and hence virus replication in cells."

The international implications of these results are also discussed. A survey of U.S. stem cell scientists shows that uncertainty following the legal challenge to the Obama Administration's hESC research policy has negative scientific and economic impacts and affects a range of stem cell scientists, not just those working with hESCs. The international implications of these results are also discussed. One consequence of the ethical controversy inspired by human embryonic stem cell (hESC) research has been an atypically uncertain policy environment. For stem cell scientists in the United States and, in particular, those scientists working with hESCs, frequent policy changes have made the years since these cells were first derived (Thomson et al., 1998Thomson J.A. Itskovitz-Eldor J. Shapiro S.S. Waknitz M.A. Swiergiel J.J. Marshall V.S. Jones J.M. Science. 1998; 282: 1145-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (11500) Google Scholar) something of a roller coaster. Similar challenges have faced stem cell scientists around the world, as numerous countries in Europe, South America, and Asia, as well as the European Union as a whole, have engaged in protracted debates over stem cell policy (see Gottweis et al., 2009Gottweis H. Salter B. Waldby C. The Global Politics of Human Embryonic Stem Cell Science: Regenerative Medicine in Transition. New York, Palgrave Macmillan, Basingstoke2009Crossref Google Scholar for a discussion of global stem cell policy debates). In the United States, scientists have faced several hESC policy changes (reviewed in Gottweis, 2010Gottweis H. Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 7: 555-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). First, following a legal review, the Clinton Administration adopted a policy in August 2000 that permitted federal funding of hESC research, but not the derivation of new hESC lines (65 Fed. Reg. 51,975). Before any grants could be funded, however, the Bush Administration put this policy on hold and President Bush announced a new policy in August 2001 limiting federal funding to research using hESC lines derived prior to the date of his speech. Although this policy remained in place for nearly eight years, uncertainty persisted. Congress, for instance, twice passed legislation to overturn the temporal restrictions central to the policy, yet President Bush vetoed both these bills. During the Bush Administration, stem cell policy was frequently addressed at the state level with some states supporting stem cell research and others restricting it, creating one of the many heterogeneous “policy patchworks” that have become typical of the field, even on an international scale (Caulfield et al., 2009Caulfield T. Zarzeczny A. McCormick J. Bubela T. Critchley C. Einsiedel E. Galipeau J. Harmon S. Huynh M. Hyun I. et al.Stem Cell Rev. 2009; 5: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Supportive state policies aimed to provide a workaround for scientists affected by federal funding restrictions, yet even these programs were plagued by uncertainty, as legal challenges and state budget problems hindered their implementation. California's stem cell program, for instance, was delayed for nearly 2 and a half years by litigation, causing difficulties for scientists considering starting new stem cell projects or moving to new institutions. California's funding is now flowing and the state has awarded more than $1 billion, yet the future of this program remains uncertain as the end of its 10 year term approaches (see Karmali et al., 2010Karmali R.N. Jones N.M. Levine A.D. Nat. Biotechnol. 2010; 28: 1246-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar for a recent review of state stem cell funding). More recently, at the federal level, the Obama Administration adopted a new stem cell research policy in July 2009 (74 Fed. Reg. 32,170), only to throw the field into chaos when scientists realized the limited number of hESC lines that had been eligible for federal funding during the Bush Administration were no longer on the approved list and needed to be reevaluated. Key hESC lines, including the two most heavily studied lines, have since been added to the registry, but not before months of uncertainty during which some scientists were placed in the awkward position of choosing to delay projects until their preferred cell lines were approved or switching to other lines and facing the delays associated with reoptimizing experimental protocols. A legal challenge filed following the promulgation of the Obama Administration's policy adds additional uncertainty to the field. This challenge claims that the Obama Administration's policy violates the Dickey-Wicker Amendment, a rider added to the Department of Health and Human Services appropriations bill each year since fiscal year 1996. This lawsuit received minimal attention from the scientific community until August 23, 2010 when U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth granted the plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction barring implementation of the Obama Administration's policy pending the outcome of the court case. This ruling led the NIH to suspend funding and review of pending hESC research proposals as well as evaluation of new hESC lines (see Gottweis, 2010Gottweis H. Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 7: 555-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar for a general discussion, U.S. NIH Notice NOT-OD-10-126 for details). The Obama Administration appealed and on September 9, 2010 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia enjoined the preliminary injunction, allowing the NIH to resume funding hESC research while the case proceeded. Both the ultimate outcome of this case and the length of time before the outcome is known are uncertain, placing some scientists in the situation of checking the news each day to determine the legal status of their research (Harmon, 2010Harmon, A. (2010). Stem Cells in Court, Scientists Fear for Careers. In New York Times, pp. A14.Google Scholar). Although the ultimate outcome of the litigation will depend on statutory interpretation of the Dickey-Wicker Amendment, much of the legal wrangling thus far has focused on the issue of potential harm to stem cell scientists associated with these policy changes. In his ruling announcing the injunction, Judge Lamberth concluded that the plaintiffs—two adult stem cell scientists—would “suffer irreparable injury in the absence of the injunction” due to increased competition for limited federal research funding, while the ruling “would not seriously harm ESC researchers because the injunction would simply preserve the status quo and would not interfere with their ability to obtain private funding for their research” (U.S. District Court for the District of ColumbiaU.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Civ. No. 1:09-cv-1575 (RCL). Memorandum Opinion. Document 44.Google Scholar). In its appeal, the Obama Administration disagreed, arguing that the harm to the plaintiffs was speculative and “cannot outweigh the disruption or ruin of research into promising treatments for the most debilitating illnesses and injuries” caused by the preliminary injunction (U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. CircuitU.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. No. 10-5287. Defendants' Emergency Motion to Stay Preliminary Injunction Pending Appeal and Request for Immediate Administrative Stay. Document 1264671.Google Scholar). Despite this ongoing legal debate in the United States and the prevalence of policy uncertainty in this field around the world, relatively few empirical studies address these issues. In order to begin to fill this gap, this Forum reports responses from 370 individuals who participated in a survey of U.S. stem cell scientists in November 2010 and assesses the reported impact of the preliminary injunction and ongoing uncertainty about the future of federal funding for hESC research on their work (see Supplemental Information available online for details of survey design and analysis strategies employed). These data show that both Judge Lamberth's ruling and the ongoing uncertainty have had a substantial impact on stem cell scientists and illustrate that this impact extends beyond hESC scientists to affect, often negatively, a larger group of stem cell scientists. Scientists reported the impact of the temporary funding ban and ongoing policy uncertainty on a four-point scale ranging from no impact to substantial impact and scientists who indicated that they experienced an impact were asked to briefly explain the impact (see Table S1 for the text of the survey questions). Figure 1 shows the responses for these questions for three groups: (1) Scientists who use hESCs in their research; (2) scientists who do not use hESCS but do use human induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSCs), nonhuman embryonic stem cells, or non-human IPSCs in their research; and (3) scientists who use only nonpluripotent stem cells in their research. Scientists working with hESCs were most likely to report being impacted by the temporary ban. Approximately 75% of these scientists reported an impact and 24% reported a substantial impact. In addition, 41% of stem cell scientists not working with hESCs reported that the temporary ban impacted their research, and 13% of these respondents indicated this impact was either moderate or substantial. Notably, among the 50 non-hESC scientists who indicated they were impacted by the ban and answered a free-text question describing this impact, negative impacts were much more common than the positive impact envisioned by Judge Lamberth in his ruling. In total, 45 of these non-hESC scientist respondents described negative impacts (e.g., hindered collaborations, blocked review of funding applications, and challenges recruiting), two described positive impacts (enhanced attractiveness and fundability of non-hESC research), and three could not be classified as clearly positive or negative. The impact of ongoing policy uncertainty on stem cell scientists' research plans was more substantial than the impact of the temporary funding ban. Just under half of the hESC scientists who participated in the survey indicated that this uncertainty has a substantial impact on their research plans and another 28% of these scientists said this uncertainty has a moderate impact. In addition, 47% of scientists who worked with pluripotent stem cells, but not hESCs, and 22% of scientists working only with nonpluripotent stem cells also indicated that this uncertainty has either a moderate or substantial impact on their research plans. To better understand the nature of these impacts, the responses of the 235 scientists who provided a free-text description of the impact of policy uncertainty on their research plans were analyzed (see Supplemental Information for details). Table 1 shows the ten most frequent impacts mentioned by these respondents (see Table S2 for example responses for each impact). Many of these reported impacts affected the type or quality of science that these scientists conducted, by, for instance, changing the types of stem cells they used in their research. The single most common impact—mentioned by 50 respondents—was delaying plans to begin hESC research or start a new hESC research project. Over 80% of the respondents reporting this impact did not currently work with hESCs but were considering transitioning their research to use these cells. In addition, 34 scientists identified transitioning away from or reducing reliance on hESCs as an impact of the ongoing uncertainty. Not all of these scientists specified the type of research to which they were transitioning, but 13 indicated that they were shifting their research to human IPSCs or nonhuman embryonic stem cells, even if, as might be the case, these were less appropriate tools for their specific research questions. Forty-four scientists indicated that policy uncertainty was impeding ongoing research. This impact took several forms, including increased cost and administrative burden associated with returning to the Bush Administration practice of segregating federally and nonfederally funded hESC research or conducting research in duplicate with both hESCs and IPSCs. Also notable, given the ongoing economic downturn and the inclusion of research funding as part of the financial stimulus plan, were economic impacts noted by some scientists. In particular, 24 scientists indicated that the ongoing policy uncertainty made it difficult to engage in long-term planning, such as decisions to hire postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and research technicians. In addition, a small number of stem cell scientists indicated that the ongoing uncertainty was leading them to consider relocating to more favorable research environments. Similar to the impact of the temporary ban discussed above, there was little evidence that non-hESC scientists found this uncertainty beneficial. Only 4 of the 87 responding non-hESC scientists who provided a free-text description of the impact described it as beneficial to their research through increased prominence or funding opportunities. In contrast, 6 of these non-hESC scientists described a negative impact on their research through, for example, increased competition (presumably from hESC scientists moving to non-hESC work) or spillover effects between various types of stem cell research. In addition, numerous non-hESC scientists described other negative impacts, such as hindered collaborations and changes to their future research plans. These results indicate that policy uncertainty surrounding hESC research in the United States has both negative scientific and economic impacts and affects scientists working with all types of stem cells.Table 1Impacts of Ongoing Policy Uncertainty on Stem Cell Scientists' Future Research PlansImpactNumber of RespondentsPercent of ImpactsDelay plans to begin hESC research or new hESC project5018%Impede ongoing research4416%Limit future funding options3713%Transition away from or reduce reliance on hESCs3412%Disrupt long-term planning (e.g., hiring decisions)249%Adopt suboptimal research designs197%Delay or abandon NIH proposals145%Alter NIH proposals to avoid hESC research114%Consider relocation93%Disrupt collaborations93%The ten most common impacts reported by stem cell scientists are shown, based on qualitative analysis of free-text responses describing the impact of ongoing policy uncertainty on scientists' research plans.

Open table in a new tab The ten most common impacts reported by stem cell scientists are shown, based on qualitative analysis of free-text responses describing the impact of ongoing policy uncertainty on scientists' research plans. See Table S2 for example responses for each impact. The results reported here provide one of the first systematic estimates of the impact of the short-lived preliminary injunction and ongoing policy uncertainty on the conduct of stem cell research in the United States. The results conflict with Judge Lamberth's assertion that his preliminary injunction would have little impact and suggest that rather than simply preserving the status quo, this injunction substantively changed the playing field for many hESC scientists in the United States as well as a lesser number of stem cell scientists working with other cell types. In addition, these results indicate the broad impact of ongoing policy uncertainty on the research plans of stem cell scientists. These results suggest that, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the ongoing legal proceedings, Judge Lamberth's ruling has already been a substantial victory for opponents of hESC research. The ruling increased the policy uncertainty in the field at a time when many scientists believed President Obama's policy offered respite from a lengthy period of restricted funding and has encouraged scientists to reconsider plans to use hESCs in their research or accelerated plans to transition away from these cells. More surprisingly, these results also suggest that the ruling and ongoing policy uncertainty have negatively affected non-hESC stem cell research, a finding that likely runs counter to the plaintiffs' hopes. While this analysis focused on stem cell scientists in the United States, presumably the scientists most affected by the ongoing litigation, the nature of some of the impacts reported—notably the disruption of collaborative research projects—suggests that this particular case of policy uncertainty might also be affecting stem cell scientists around the world. Policy heterogeneity has previously been identified as a concern that could hinder collaborative stem cell research (Mathews et al., 2006Mathews D.J. Donovan P. Harris J. Lovell-Badge R. Savulescu J. Faden R. Science. 2006; 313: 921-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and this analysis suggests that policy uncertainty—essentially a form of policy heterogeneity over time—should also be considered a potential barrier to collaboration. Policy uncertainty may also hinder academic/industry collaborations and limit access to venture funding, hindering commercialization of hESC-based technologies (Harvey, 2009Harvey O. Politics & Policy. 2009; 37: 51-71Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Although the current U.S. situation, where a lawsuit threatens the legality of all federal hESC funding, is a particularly dramatic case, scientific uncertainty can arise in other situations, and this analysis also highlights the types of impacts policymakers around the world should consider when crafting stem cell policies. In addition to arguing for a reassessment of the concept of harm to stem cell scientists in the ongoing legal proceedings, these findings suggest more broadly that lawmakers, both in the United States and around the world, aiming to support stem cell research should strive for policies that, to the extent possible, reduce uncertainty facing stem cell scientists. In the United States, passing legislation to provide a clear legal basis for the federal funding of hESC research, thus pre-empting the ongoing legal proceedings and reducing the field's reliance on executive action, would meet these goals. For individual U.S. states as well as other jurisdictions around the world developing stem cell funding policies, adopting long-term programs rather than relying on yearly authorizations would seem a wise strategy. Given the divisiveness of the debate over hESC research and the history of policymaking in other morally charged areas, however, such policy certainty will likely prove difficult to achieve and some degree of uncertainty may be unavoidable. For this reason, hESC scientists should prepare to face continued policy fluctuations, legal challenges, and other hurdles to their research in the future.

https://openalex.org/W2070366248,"Ribonucleotide reduction provides deoxynucleotides for nuclear and mitochondrial (mt) DNA replication and DNA repair. In cycling mammalian cells the reaction is catalyzed by two proteins, R1 and R2. A third protein, p53R2, with the same function as R2, occurs in minute amounts. In quiescent cells, p53R2 replaces the absent R2. In humans, genetic inactivation of p53R2 causes early death with mtDNA depletion, especially in muscle. We found that cycling fibroblasts from a patient with a lethal mutation in p53R2 contained a normal amount of mtDNA and showed normal growth, ribonucleotide reduction, and deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) pools. However, when made quiescent by prolonged serum starvation the mutant cells strongly down-regulated ribonucleotide reduction, decreased their dCTP and dGTP pools, and virtually abolished the catabolism of dCTP in substrate cycles. mtDNA was not affected. Also, nuclear DNA synthesis and the cell cycle-regulated enzymes R2 and thymidine kinase 1 decreased strongly, but the mutant cell populations retained unexpectedly larger amounts of the two enzymes than the controls. This difference was probably due to their slightly larger fraction of S phase cells and therefore not induced by the absence of p53R2 activity. We conclude that loss of p53R2 affects ribonucleotide reduction only in resting cells and leads to a decrease of dNTP catabolism by substrate cycles that counterweigh the loss of anabolic activity. We speculate that this compensatory mechanism suffices to maintain mtDNA in fibroblasts but not in muscle cells with a larger content of mtDNA necessary for their high energy requirements.

We speculate that this compensatory mechanism suffices to maintain mtDNA in fibroblasts but not in muscle cells with a larger content of mtDNA necessary for their high energy requirements. Cells replicate their nuclear DNA during a defined period of the cell cycle, the S phase, which in most mammalian cells occupies <50% of the whole cycle. During this period a rapid synthesis of the four canonical dNTPs 2The abbreviations used are: dNTPdeoxynucleoside triphosphateMEMminimal essential mediummtmitochondrialRNRribonucleotide reductase. occurs with a massive 10–30-fold expansion of pool sizes despite the high turnover of dNTPs during DNA replication (1Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 349-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). dNTPs are mainly produced de novo by reduction of ribonucleoside diphosphates, and their large increase depends on up-regulation of the two nonidentical subunits R1 and R2 of the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase (RNR). Transcription of the two genes is activated just before and during early S phase (2Björklund S. Skog S. Tribukait B. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5452-5458Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 3Chabes A.L. Björklund S. Thelander L. J. Biol.

Both subunits are required for catalytic activity. The larger protein R1 carries the catalytic site for the reduction of the ribose moiety, whereas the smaller R2 generates and harbors a stable tyrosyl free radical essential for the catalytic process (4Nordlund P. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 681-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). The reduction of ribonucleotides is tightly tuned to the requirements of the cells for dNTPs. Excessive or imbalanced dNTP pools cause genetic abnormalities and can lead to cell death (1Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 349-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 5Kunz B.A. Kohalmi S.E. Kunkel T.A. Mathews C.K. McIntosh E.M. Reidy J.A. Mutat. Res. 1994; 318: 1-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). An immediate defense mechanism against dNTP imbalance is provided by a highly complex system of allosteric effects that directs not only the overall activity of RNR but also the specificity of the enzyme for its substrates (1Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 349-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 4Nordlund P. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 681-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). Moreover, nucleoside phosphorylases and 5′-deoxynucleotidases keep overproduction of dNTPs at bay in substrate cycles by their catabolic function (6Rampazzo C. Miazzi C. Franzolin E. Pontarin G. Ferraro P. Frangini M. Reichard P. Bianchi V. Mutat. Res. 2010; 703: 2-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Once DNA replication is completed, the transcriptional activation of the R1 and R2 genes ceases, adapting ribonucleotide reduction to the greatly diminished consumption of dNTPs. Furthermore, after completion of DNA replication the R2 subunit is degraded rapidly (7Chabes A.L. Pfleger C.M. Kirschner M.W. Thelander L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 3925-3929Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Its “KEN box,” a specific amino acid sequence located in its N terminus, provides a signal for ubiquitylation of R2 during mitosis by anaphase-promoting complex Cdh1 leading to proteasomal degradation. How do quiescent cells in the absence of R2 obtain the small amounts of dNTPs required for DNA repair and mtDNA replication? The discovery of p53R2, a third subunit of RNR coded by the RRM2B gene (8Tanaka H. Arakawa H. Yamaguchi T. Shiraishi K. Fukuda S. Matsui K. Takei Y. Nakamura Y. Nature. 2000; 404: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar, 9Nakano K. Bálint E. Ashcroft M. Vousden K.H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4283-4289Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), answered this question. On a protein basis, R2 and p53R2 are equally active in their function of generating the tyrosyl free radical used by R1 for catalysis (10Guittet O. Håkansson P. Voevodskaya N. Fridd S. Gräslund A. Arakawa H. Nakamura Y. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40647-40651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The primary structures of p53R2 and R2 are essentially identical, except for the absence in p53R2 of the N-terminal stretch of 33 amino acids that in R2 contains the KEN box. This difference turns p53R2 into a stable protein that persists during the whole cell cycle and is active also in nondividing cells. p53R2 is the subject of the present paper. Actively dividing cells contain comparable amounts of R1 and R2, but only minute amounts of p53R2 (11Håkansson P. Hofer A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7834-7841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 12Pontarin G. Ferraro P. Håkansson P. Thelander L. Reichard P. Bianchi V. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16820-16828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). After DNA damage, when p53R2 is induced by p53, S phase cells contain much less p53R2 than R2 (11Håkansson P. Hofer A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7834-7841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). It is therefore difficult to believe that p53R2 plays a major role in dNTP synthesis during S phase. Under those circumstances it has a standby function, and R2 provides the tyrosyl radical for catalysis. The p53R2 subunit becomes relevant in quiescent and postmitotic cells where it together with R1 synthesizes the low levels of dNTPs necessary for nuclear DNA repair and mtDNA synthesis. In situ measurements of enzyme activity by isotope-flow technology demonstrated that in quiescent human fibroblasts ribonucleotide reduction amounted to ≈2–3% of that occurring in cycling cells (12Pontarin G.

Severe mtDNA depletion was also found in various tissues of p53R2 knock-out mice (13Bourdon A. Minai L. Serre V. Jais J.P. Sarzi E. Aubert S. Chrétien D. de Lonlay P. Paquis-Flucklinger V. Arakawa H.

Thus, the phenotypic consequences of p53R2 deficiency are well documented in vivo and indicate that the function of p53R2 is essential for the stability of the mt genome in differentiated tissues. In cellular systems the effects of p53R2 inactivation have been studied by siRNA silencing in transformed cell lines (21Tsai M.H. Chen X. Chandramouli G.V. Chen Y. Yan H. Zhao S. Keng P. Liber H.L.

In the absence of a functioning p53 the role of p53R2 during the DNA damage response was suggested to be taken up by R2 (23Lin Z.P. Belcourt M.F. Cory J.G. Sartorelli A.C. J. Biol.

We were interested in examining the consequences of p53R2 inactivation for the metabolism of dNTPs in normal noncycling cells not exposed to DNA-damaging agents, a model closer to the postmitotic cells affected in vivo by p53R2 deficiency. Here, we study deoxynucleotide metabolism in human fibroblasts from a patient with a homozygous missense mutation substituting a glycine by a valine residue in the diferric iron center of p53R2, thereby impeding the generation of the tyrosyl radical. The patient died in early infancy with severe depletion of mtDNA in muscle (15Kollberg G. Darin N. Benan K. Moslemi A.R. Lindal S. Tulinius M. Oldfors A. Holme E. Neuromuscul. Disord. 2009; 19: 147-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We obtained quiescent fibroblasts by maintaining confluent cultures for up to 27 days in medium with 0.1% fetal calf serum and investigated the effects of the mutation on parameters related to the synthesis and metabolism of deoxynucleotides. In cycling cells and at different times during prolonged quiescence we determined (i) the distribution of cells in the cell cycle, (ii) the size of the four dNTP pools, (iii) the expression of enzymes relevant for dNTP synthesis, (iv) quantified in situ ribonucleotide reduction during incubation of cells with [3H]cytidine, and (v) measured the level of mtDNA. In cycling cultures, all these parameters did not differ between mutant and age-matched normal fibroblasts. Instead, in quiescent cultures the activity of RNR and related parameters decreased more in the mutant cells, but we found no depletion of mtDNA. Surprisingly, the overall down-regulation of cell cycle-related proteins, such as R2, thymidine kinase 1, and cyclin B1, was less marked in the mutant cell population, probably caused by a slightly higher frequency of S phase cells. Our experiments show that p53R2 function is dispensable in cycling cells during normal growth and that nonproliferating fibroblasts by repressing dNTP catabolism can cope with a strongly reduced ribonucleotide reduction without apparent destabilization of the mt genome. [5-methyl-3H]Thymidine (20,000 cpm/pmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. [5-3H]Cytidine (30,000–40,000 cpm/pmol) was from Moravek (Brea, CA). It contained also [6-3H]cytidine as revealed by radioactivity found in dTTP after in situ labeling of cells. Antibodies used were anti-human R2 goat polyclonal (sc-10844; Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-human p53R2 rabbit polyclonal (ab8105; Abcam), anti-human R1 mouse monoclonal mAb 3033 (Millipore), anti-β-actin mouse monoclonal (clone AC-74; Sigma), and anti-BrdU mouse monoclonal (clone BMG 6H8; Roche Applied Science). p53R2-mutated human skin fibroblasts were isolated from a patient carrying a homozygous missense mutation in the RRMB2 gene (15Kollberg G.

Samples of both lines were frozen in liquid nitrogen and after thawing were used in parallel for experiments. In one case we also used an additional control line of human skin fibroblasts from a different healthy donor (25Rampazzo C. Fabris S. Franzolin E. Crovatto K. Frangini M. Bianchi V. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 34758-34769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). All lines were cultured in 5- or 10-cm dishes in Eagle's minimal essential medium (MEM) with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS, New Zealand, Invitrogen) and nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen) in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. At intervals we checked the cells for mycoplasma contamination by the Venor GEM PCR-based method (Minerva Biolabs). To obtain quiescent fibroblasts we seeded 0.35 million cells/10-cm dish and grew them in MEM with 10% FCS. After 7–10 days, when cells were contact-inhibited, they were transferred to medium with 0.1% dialyzed FCS and maintained in culture for up to 4 weeks. Fresh medium containing 0.1% serum was supplied twice a week. During serum starvation we monitored the cultures for percent S phase cells by flow cytometry. During growth in 0.1% serum the percentage of cycling cells in the population decreased to below 1%. To check cell vitality during starvation we trypsinized the cells at the end of the starvation period, replated them in fresh medium with 10% serum, and followed their renewed growth and ability to incorporate BrdU during a further 7 days. We conducted in all three complete starvation experiments ending on the 21st or 27th day, making our analyses at selected days, as outlined under “Results.” We made some additional experiments to confirm data at the end of the starvation period. We labeled cells by incubation with either 1 μm [3H]cytidine or 0.3 μm [3H]thymidine to determine the in situ metabolism of dNTPs by procedures described earlier (12Pontarin G. Ferraro P.

Briefly, in the cytidine experiment we labeled the cells for 4 h and then chased the isotope with nonlabeled medium for 2 more h. We used the difference of isotope incorporation between the two time points to calculate the rate of ribonucleotide reduction from the sum of isotope incorporated into DNA and the products of dCTP catabolism (deoxyuridine + deoxycytidine). In the [3H]thymidine experiments we introduced the isotope for either 1 or 4 h without chase and determined the rate of DNA synthesis from the difference of isotope incorporation between the two time points. In all experiments we determined the specific radioactivities of the relevant dNTP to calculate rates as pmol/min. At the end of incubation we transferred the plates on ice to a cold room, collected the medium in the chase experiments, washed the monolayers three times with PBS, extracted nucleotide pools with 60% ice-cold methanol, and processed them as described earlier (27Ferraro P.

J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34098-34104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To measure the excretion of nucleosides, we deproteinized the chase medium with perchloric acid (31Pontarin G. Ferraro P. Valentino M.L. Hirano M. Reichard P. Bianchi V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22720-22728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and determined the amount of radioactive deoxycytidine and deoxyuridine by HPLC on a LUNA C18 (Phenomenex, Torrance CA) column (250 × 4.4 mm) (32Gazziola C.

We measured DNA synthesis by incorporation of isotope from [3H]cytidine or [3H]thymidine. In both cases we calculated rates as pmol/min from the isotope incorporated between the two time points and the determined average specific radioactivities of [3H]dCTP or [3H]dTTP. In the calculations of the cytidine experiments we assume incorporation of both dCTP and dTTP and use a T/C ratio of 1.3 in DNA (12Pontarin G. Ferraro P. Håkansson P. Thelander L. Reichard P. Bianchi V. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16820-16828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Cycling and quiescent fibroblasts were grown on coverslips. After either 16- or 30-h incubation with 30 μm BrdU the cells were fixed with 50 mm glycine, pH 2, and 70% ethanol for 20 min at −20 °C. Then the coverslips were incubated with the primary anti-BrdU antibody following the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science) and washed three times with PBS. The slides were incubated with anti-mouse Ig-fluorescein for 30 min at 37 °C. After further washing, they were mounted with mounting medium containing 0.2 μg/ml DAPI. We used the Applied Biosystems 7500 Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) to quantify by real-time RT-PCR the mRNA expression of the three RNR subunits, thymidine kinase 1, and cyclin B1. Total RNA was extracted from cycling and quiescent cultures with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). We prepared cDNAs by reverse transcription and performed real-time PCR assays in 96-wells optical plates as described in Ref. 25Rampazzo C. Fabris S. Franzolin E. Crovatto K. Frangini M. Bianchi V. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 34758-34769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar. Primers for R1, R2, and succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit A were reported earlier (25Rampazzo C. Fabris S. Franzolin E. Crovatto K. Frangini M. Bianchi V. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 34758-34769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). New primers used here were the p53R2 primers (5′-GAGGCTCGCTGTTTCTATGG-3′ and 5′-ATCTGCTATCCATCGCAAGG-3′), thymidine kinase 1 primers (5′-CCCTGACATCGTGGAGTTCT-3′ and 5′-TGCCGAGCCTCTTGGTATAG-3′), cyclin B1 primers (5′-TCCAGTTATGCAGCACCTGGCTA-3′ and 5′-TGCCACAGCCTTGGCTAAATCTT-3′), and an additional set of primers for R2 (5′-TGGCAGACAGACTTATGCTGGA-3′ and 5′-GGACTTGACATCACTCCCATCC-3′). To normalize the expression of individual target genes in control and mutant cells we chose succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit A as reference because it is expressed equally during cell proliferation and quiescence. Each cDNA preparation was analyzed at least six times. We employed the comparative Ct method (33Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (25872) Google Scholar) for data processing. We determined human mtDNA copy number with the TaqMan probe system and Applied Biosystems 7500 Real Time PCR as described in Ref. 34Andreu A.L. Martinez R. Marti R. García-Arumí E. Mitochondrion. 2009; 9: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar. Briefly, total DNA was extracted from control and mutant fibroblasts with Puregene Core Kit B (Qiagen). The mt 12 S ribosomal RNA TaqMan probe and primers (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were used to quantify mtDNA whereas for nuclear DNA we used the RNase P primers and probes contained in TaqMan predeveloped assay (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). mtDNA and nuclear DNA copy numbers were determined using calibration curves generated by serial dilution of a mixture of plasmids carrying the two PCR amplicons as described (34Andreu A.L. Martinez R. Marti R. García-Arumí E. Mitochondrion. 2009; 9: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We collected pellets of 1–2 million cells, washed them with 0.9% NaCl, and lysed them with lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Triton X-100). After addition of NaCl to a final concentration of 0.2 m and additional vortexing, we centrifuged the extract at 19,000 × g for 20 min and used the supernatant solutions for assays (35Gallinaro L.

We determined protein concentration by the BCA protein assay (Pierce) and loaded equal amounts of protein for electrophoresis on 9% polyacrylamide gels. We used separate gels for each subunit of RNR. When the number of samples to be analyzed was too high to be run in a single gel, we loaded aliquots of the same reference sample on both gels to be compared. We transferred proteins to a Hybond-C extra membrane (GE Healthcare), blocked the unspecific sites with 2% ECL blocking agent (GE Healthcare), and incubated the filter overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibody. After washing the membrane three times for 5 min each, we incubated it with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. After further washing we developed the filter in an ECL-advanced system (GE Healthcare). The signal was detected and quantified with a Kodak one-dimensional Imaging station 440CF. Parallel cultures of a human fibroblast line with mutated p53R2 and a matched normal control, both from the fifth passage, showed similar growth behavior in medium containing 10% FCS, including the distribution of cells in the cell cycle at different days of growth (Fig. 1, A and B). After 10 days, when the cells had reached confluence, we changed the medium to contain dialyzed 0.1% FCS (day 0) and maintained the cultures for up to 27 days to deplete the cells of protein R2 further and arrest nuclear DNA replication. Both mutant and control cells remained attached to the plates during serum starvation, but cell cycle analyses demonstrated a small progressive increase in the subG1 fraction indicating some cell death, that amounted to close to 10% after 21 days, slightly higher in the mutant cell population (Fig. 1C). When trypsinized at the end of the starvation period and replated in medium plus 10% FCS, mutant and control cells after a lag period started to grow at similar rates and eventually became inhibited at the same cell density (data not shown). Cycling cells contained relatively large pools of each of the four dNTPs, of equal size in mutant and control cultures. Each pool decreased 15–30-fold during attainment of quiescence with dATP and dTTP showing similar changes in both cell lines whereas dCTP and probably also dGTP decreased more in the mutant line (Fig. 2). Thus, analyses of four separate pairs of cultures after 27 days of starvation showed that the mutant cultures contained 0.9 ± 0.2 pmol/million cells of dCTP whereas the controls contained 3.5 ± 0.7 pmol. The very low values for the dGTP pool did not permit a reliable comparison of the two lines. The size of each of the 4 rNTP pools did not differ between mutant and control cells and decreased by ∼50% during quiescence, with the ATP pool decreasing from 15,000 to 8000, UTP from 4000 to 2000, GTP from 2500 to 1500, and CTP from 1500 to 1000 pmol/million cells. In two independent experiments, we determined in mutant and control cells from the 10th and 12th passages the number of mtDNA copies/cell at days 0 and 27 of serum starvation. We found for the control cells an average copy number of 708 ± 70 at day 0 and 620 ± 66 at day 27; for the mutant cells we found 716 ± 52 at day 0 and 587 ± 158 at day 27. Thus, there were no significant differences. A parallel determination on total DNA from human skeletal muscle gave ∼30,000 mtDNA copies/nuclear genome. To compare the rate of ribonucleotide redu"

TS12 (NgaP). Consisting of 1034 putative amino acid residues, NgaP shares no sequence similarity with known proteins. Recombinant NgaP, expressed in Escherichia coli, cleaved the nonreducing terminal β-GalNAc residues of gangliotriaosylceramide and globotetraosylceramide. The enzyme hydrolyzed para-nitrophenyl-β-N-acetylgalactosaminide ∼100 times faster than para-nitrophenyl-β-N-acetylglucosaminide. GalNAc thiazoline, an analog of the oxazolinium intermediate and potent inhibitor for enzymes adopting substrate-assisted catalysis, competitively inhibited the enzyme. The K(i) of the enzyme for GalNAc thiazoline was 1.3 nM, whereas that for GlcNAc thiazoline was 46.8 μM. Comparison of the secondary structure with those of known enzymes exhibiting substrate-assisted catalysis and point mutation analysis indicated that NgaP adopts substrate-assisted catalysis in which Glu-608 and Asp-607 could function as a proton donor and a stabilizer of the 2-acetamide group of the β-GalNAc at the active site, respectively. These results clearly indicate that NgaP is a β-NGA showing substrate-assisted catalysis. This is the first report describing the molecular cloning of a β-NGA adopting substrate-assisted catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W2048728072,"Appropriate B cell activation is essential for adaptive immunity. In contrast to the molecular mechanisms that regulate positive signaling in immune responses, the counterbalancing negative regulatory pathways remain insufficiently understood. The Src homology domain 3 (SH3)-containing adapter protein SH3 lymphocyte protein 2 (SLy2, also known as hematopoietic adapter-containing SH3 and sterile α-motif (SAM) domains 1; HACS1) is strongly up-regulated upon B cell activation and functions as an endogenous immunoinhibitor in vivo, but the underlying molecular mechanisms of SLy2 function have been elusive. We have generated transgenic mice overexpressing SLy2 in B and T cells and have studied the biological effects of elevated SLy2 levels in Jurkat and HeLa cells. Our results demonstrate that SLy2 induces Rac1-dependent membrane ruffle formation and regulates cell spreading and polarization and that the SLy2 SH3 domain is essential for these effects. Using immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy, we provide evidence that the actin nucleation-promoting factor cortactin is an SH3 domain-directed interaction partner of SLy2. Consistent with an important role of SLy2 for actin cytoskeletal reorganization, we further show that SLy2-transgenic B cells are severely defective in cell spreading. Together, our findings extend our mechanistic understanding of the immunoinhibitory roles of SLy2 in vivo and suggest that the physiological up-regulation of SLy2 observed upon B cell activation functions to counteract excessive B cell spreading."

Cardiomyocytes differentiated from the patient-derived iPSCs exhibit the hallmark cardiac electrical signatures of the disease, which can be reversed by pharmacological intervention. The cardiac action potential (AP) is the electrical signal that triggers contraction of heart muscle, and it arises due to the highly orchestrated opening and closing of dozens of ion channels along with contributions from various ion transporters and exchangers. A rapidly changing balance of inward and outward ionic currents through these channels and transporters produces the prototypical cardiac AP. The congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) occurs when a genetic defect tips the balance of inward and outward currents to delay repolarization of the ventricular AP. The resulting increase in AP duration is reflected by a prolongation of the QT interval on the surface electrocardiogram. The prolonged AP can result in early afterdepolarizations that under some circumstances can trigger the potentially fatal ventricular arrhythmia torsades de pointes. LQTS is a common cause of sudden cardiac death in otherwise healthy young adults. Mutations in at least 12 different ion channels or channel-associated proteins have been linked to congenital LQTS. These mutations can cause gain of function, which increases depolarizing currents, or loss of function, leading to reduced repolarizing currents. In the case of LQTS type 2, mutations in the KCNH2 gene encoding the hERG potassium channel result, via multiple mechanisms, in reduced rapid delayed rectifier potassium current (IKr) and thus increased AP duration. In a recent Nature paper, Itzhaki et al., 2011Itzhaki I. Maizels L. Huber I. Zwi-Dantsis L. Caspi O. Winterstern A. Feldman O. Gepstein A. Arbel G. Hammerman H. et al.Nature. 2011; (Published online January 16, 2011)https://doi.org/10.1038/nature09747Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar use a new approach to study LQTS type 2 using patient- and disease-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). How do mutations in KCNH2 produce the disease phenotype? Most of the understanding of how mutations in ion channels cause disease is extrapolated from studies using heterologous expression systems in which the mutant channel of interest is expressed in mammalian cell lines such as immortalized human embryonic kidney 293 cells or Xenopus oocytes. Such studies have provided great insights into the possible mechanisms responsible for the reduction in IKr that causes LQTS type 2. For example, some mutations of KCNH2 are associated with abnormal gating or permeation of the channels, other mutations impact the biogenesis of the channels such as trafficking to the surface membrane, and yet others may interfere with the biochemical regulation of the channels (Delisle et al., 2004Delisle B.P. Anson B.D. Rajamani S. January C.T. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 1418-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). One allele encoding a mutant channel subunit can act as a dominant-negative suppressor given the tetrameric nature of the hERG channel. However, the hERG channel resides in a macromolecular complex that includes auxiliary subunits as well as regulatory proteins and potentially other ion channels. Such macromolecular complexes exhibit remarkable cell-type specificity, and so studying hERG channels in heterologous systems may fail to recapitulate their behavior in the human heart. Mouse models of disease are commonly employed to characterize disease-causing mutations in the cardiac environment, but in the case of IKr, this ionic current is essentially absent in the mouse heart. Patient heart samples are scarce and not practical for cellular research studies. Thus, having a model system in which a mutant hERG channel can be studied in human cardiomyocytes holds promise to provide new understanding of the disease as well as to serve as a test bed for new therapies. To generate a human cardiomyocyte model for LQTS type 2, Itzhaki et al. reprogrammed dermal fibroblasts from a patient with a missense mutation in the KCNH2 gene (A614V) using retroviral vectors for SOX2, KLF4, and OCT4. The resulting iPSCs were isolated, clonally expanded, and characterized. After inducing differentiation, both mutant and control iPSCs gave rise to contracting embryoid body (EB) outgrowths that included cardiomyocytes, based on immunolabeling for cardiac-specific proteins and gene expression patterns. Isolated cardiomyocytes were subjected to patch-clamp recordings of transmembrane voltage, and at least three different types of APs were detected, suggesting the presence of nodal-like, atrial-like, and ventricular-like cells, as previously shown for human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (Zhang et al., 2009Zhang J. Wilson G.F. Soerens A.G. Koonce C.H. Yu J. Palecek S.P. Thomson J.A. Kamp T.J. Circ. Res. 2009; 104: e30-e41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the ventricular-like and atrial-like AP durations from the LQTS disease cardiomyocytes were significantly prolonged compared to control cells. Whole-cell voltage-clamp studies demonstrated a reduction in the IKr current in disease cells relative to control, providing the anticipated cause for AP prolongation. The reduction in IKr was more than 50%, consistent with the dominant-negative effect of this mutation as suggested by a prior heterologous expression study of the A614V mutation (Nakajima et al., 1998Nakajima T. Furukawa T. Tanaka T. Katayama Y. Nagai R. Nakamura Y. Hiraoka M. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The isolated LQTS iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes also frequently showed clear proarrhythmic electrical activity in the form of early afterdepolarizations, which can serve as a trigger for arrhythmias. Thus, the two major hallmarks for LQTS at the level of the single cardiomyocyte were demonstrated in the mutation-carrying cardiomyocytes: a prolongation of the AP and the presence of early afterdepolarizations. Given the clear disease features of the LQTS cardiomyocytes, the authors tested drugs that they predicted may be able to correct the disease phenotype based on their modulation of specific ionic currents involved in repolarization. Three drugs showed promise in this first screen: the Ca2+ channel blocker nifedipine, the KATP channel opener pinacidil, and the late sodium channel blocker ranolazine. These candidates represent a first attempt at testing potentially therapeutic drugs for LQTS, but as the authors conclude, careful dose titration would be needed, as excessive shortening of the AP duration can also be proarrhythmic. In addition, the ability to test these drugs on a particular LQTS mutation cell line suggests the possibility for personalized medicine approaches allowing optimization of therapies for a given mutation and genetic background. The demonstration of a LQTS type 2 model using iPSCs is a significant advance for a number of reasons. First, despite multiple theoretical reasons why this approach should fail, such as the relative immaturity of the differentiated cardiomyocytes, which do not express the same complement of ion channels as adult heart, and the heterogeneity of cardiomyocytes, the study clearly demonstrates the anticipated changes in AP duration as well as arrhythmic activity in the form of early afterdepolarizations. This study, as well as a recent study of LQTS type 1, which is due to mutations in KCNQ1 (Moretti et al., 2010Moretti A. Bellin M. Welling A. Jung C.B. Lam J.T. Bott-Flügel L. Dorn T. Goedel A. Höhnke C. Hofmann F. et al.N. Engl. J. Med. 2010; 363: 1397-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar), provide powerful proof-of-principle demonstrations that iPSCs can serve as an important model system for investigating inherited arrhythmia syndromes. Additionally, there is growing evidence that iPSCs can model other forms of inherited heart disease such as LEOPARD syndrome (Carvajal-Vergara et al., 2010Carvajal-Vergara X. Sevilla A. D'Souza S.L. Ang Y.S. Schaniel C. Lee D.F. Yang L. Kaplan A.D. Adler E.D. Rozov R. et al.Nature. 2010; 465: 808-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar) and a growing list of other diseases. Another important advance provided by Itzhaki et al. is the demonstration that pharmacological therapies can be tested and developed using this disease model. This study also supports the concept that human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes can be used to screen for one of the most common forms of drug toxicity, drug-induced long QT syndrome, which is mainly due to the unintended block of cardiac hERG channels. The groundbreaking study by Itzhaki et al. provides critical proof-of-principle data demonstrating the promise of iPSC models for inherited arrhythmias, but major questions regarding mechanisms of disease and potential therapies remain for future investigations. For example, what was the mechanistic basis for the decrease in IKr observed? Was this impact due primarily to altered gating properties of hERG, as suggested in the heterologous expression study (Nakajima et al., 1998Nakajima T. Furukawa T. Tanaka T. Katayama Y. Nagai R. Nakamura Y. Hiraoka M. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), or could abnormalities in protein biogenesis such as protein trafficking or degradations play a role? These points are not simply academic questions, because the answers will impact potential therapeutic approaches. In addition, the as yet unrealized promise of iPSCs for disease modeling is that this system will unmask new mechanisms of disease not readily evident from heterologous expression systems. For example, how do mutations outside of the coding region of genes such as in introns lead to disease? What is the mechanism of variable penetrance within family members harboring the same disease-causing mutation? How does a mutation in a scaffolding protein impact multiple associated proteins present uniquely in native cells? Clearly, new mechanistic insights into disease pathology may have implications for therapy, which makes the patient-derived disease lines a promising resource. Although encouraging observations were made regarding candidate drug effects on the cardiac AP in LQTS iPS cardiomyocytes, the two most effective tested drugs, nifedipine and pinacidil, are unlikely to be clinically relevant given that the concentrations used by Itzhaki and colleagues would carry the risk of unacceptable hypotension due to their effects on vascular smooth muscle channels. Sorting out drugs with the needed specificity to impact heart cells without adverse effects in other tissues remains an important challenge. Thus, simply testing small molecules in the iPSC-derived cell lineage manifesting the disease phenotype will only begin the process. Future studies will likely benefit from improved methodologies to differentiate the iPSCs into the desired cell types, which will enable potentially more representative models such as three-dimensional engineered heart tissue (Eschenhagen and Zimmermann, 2005Eschenhagen T. Zimmermann W.H. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 1220-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The LQTS type 2 iPSCs will be part of a growing toolkit of iPSCs used to model various forms of inherited arrhythmia syndromes and other human diseases, and it is inevitable that, as technologies improve in coming years, many electrifying advances lie ahead."
https://openalex.org/W2009935784,"Internalization of the Na+/H+ exchanger NHE5 into recycling endosomes is enhanced by the endocytic adaptor proteins β-arrestin1 and -2, best known for their preferential recognition of ligand-activated G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). However, the mechanism underlying their atypical association with non-GPCRs, such as NHE5, is unknown. In this study, we identified a highly acidic, serine/threonine-rich, di-isoleucine motif (amino acids 697–723) in the cytoplasmic C terminus of NHE5 that is recognized by β-arrestin2. Gross deletions of this site decreased the state of phosphorylation of NHE5 as well as its binding and responsiveness to β-arrestin2 in intact cells. More refined in vitro analyses showed that this site was robustly phosphorylated by the acidotropic protein kinase CK2, whereas other kinases, such as CK1 or the GPCR kinase GRK2, were considerably less potent. Simultaneous mutation of five Ser/Thr residues within 702–714 to Ala (702ST/AA714) abolished phosphorylation and binding of β-arrestin2. In transfected cells, the CK2 catalytic α subunit formed a complex with NHE5 and decreased wild-type but not 702ST/AA714 NHE5 activity, further supporting a regulatory role for this kinase. The rate of internalization of 702ST/AA714 was also diminished and relatively insensitive to overexpression of β-arrestin2. However, unlike in vitro, this mutant retained its ability to form a complex with β-arrestin2 despite its lack of responsiveness. Additional mutations of two di-isoleucine-based motifs (I697A/L698A and I722A/I723A) that immediately flank the acidic cluster, either separately or together, were required to disrupt their association. These data demonstrate that discrete elements of an elaborate sorting signal in NHE5 contribute to β-arrestin2 binding and trafficking along the recycling endosomal pathway. Internalization of the Na+/H+ exchanger NHE5 into recycling endosomes is enhanced by the endocytic adaptor proteins β-arrestin1 and -2, best known for their preferential recognition of ligand-activated G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). However, the mechanism underlying their atypical association with non-GPCRs, such as NHE5, is unknown. In this study, we identified a highly acidic, serine/threonine-rich, di-isoleucine motif (amino acids 697–723) in the cytoplasmic C terminus of NHE5 that is recognized by β-arrestin2. Gross deletions of this site decreased the state of phosphorylation of NHE5 as well as its binding and responsiveness to β-arrestin2 in intact cells. More refined in vitro analyses showed that this site was robustly phosphorylated by the acidotropic protein kinase CK2, whereas other kinases, such as CK1 or the GPCR kinase GRK2, were considerably less potent. Simultaneous mutation of five Ser/Thr residues within 702–714 to Ala (702ST/AA714) abolished phosphorylation and binding of β-arrestin2. In transfected cells, the CK2 catalytic α subunit formed a complex with NHE5 and decreased wild-type but not 702ST/AA714 NHE5 activity, further supporting a regulatory role for this kinase. The rate of internalization of 702ST/AA714 was also diminished and relatively insensitive to overexpression of β-arrestin2. However, unlike in vitro, this mutant retained its ability to form a complex with β-arrestin2 despite its lack of responsiveness. Additional mutations of two di-isoleucine-based motifs (I697A/L698A and I722A/I723A) that immediately flank the acidic cluster, either separately or together, were required to disrupt their association. These data demonstrate that discrete elements of an elaborate sorting signal in NHE5 contribute to β-arrestin2 binding and trafficking along the recycling endosomal pathway."

Integrin α4β7 mediates both rolling and firm adhesion of lymphocytes by modulating its affinity to the ligand, mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1). Although previous studies have revealed some mechanisms of α4β7-MAdCAM-1 binding, little is known about the different molecular bases of the low- and high-affinity α4β7-MAdCAM-1 interactions, which mediate rolling and firm adhesion of lymphocytes, respectively. Here, we found that two loops in immunoglobulin domains 1 and 2 (D1 and D2) of MAdCAM-1 played different roles in MAdCAM-1 binding to low-affinity (inactive) and high-affinity (activated) α4β7. The Asp-42 in the CC′ loop of D1 was indispensable for MAdCAM-1 binding to both low-affinity and high-affinity α4β7. The other CC′ loop residues except for Arg-39 and Ser-44 were essential for MAdCAM-1 binding to both inactive α4β7 and α4β7 activated by SDF-1α or talin, but not required for MAdCAM-1 binding to Mn2+-activated α4β7. Single amino acid substitution of the DE loop residues mildly decreased MAdCAM-1 binding to both inactive and activated α4β7. Notably, removal of the DE loop greatly impaired MAdCAM-1 binding to inactive and SDF-1α- or talin-activated α4β7, but only decreased 60% of MAdCAM-1 binding to Mn2+-activated α4β7. Moreover, DE loop residues were important for stabilizing the low-affinity α4β7-MAdCAM-1 interaction. Thus, our findings demonstrate the distinct roles of the CC′ and DE loops in the recognition of MAdCAM-1 by low- and high-affinity α4β7 and suggest that the inactive α4β7 and α4β7 activated by different stimuli have distinct conformations with different structural requirements for MAdCAM-1 binding.

IntroductionLymphocyte homing from circulation to lymphoid tissues and sites of inflammation is regulated by the dynamic interaction between lymphocyte integrin receptors and endothelial immunoglobulin superfamily cell adhesion molecules (1Springer T.A.

Picker L.J. Science. 1996; 272: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (2502) Google Scholar). Integrin α4β7 is an important lymphocyte homing receptor that can mediate both rolling and firm adhesion of lymphocytes, two of the critical steps in lymphocyte migration and tissue-specific homing (4Gorfu G. Rivera-Nieves J. Ley K. Curr. Mol. Med. 2009; 9: 836-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Its ligand, MAdCAM-1, 2The abbreviations used are: MAdCAM-1, mucosal cell adhesion molecule-1; MIDAS, metal ion-dependent adhesion site; ADMIDAS, adjacent to MIDAS; PBL, peripheral blood lymphocyte; hu, human. is preferentially expressed on high endothelial venules of gut-associated lymphoid organs and on lamina propria venules, helping lymphocyte traffic to mucosal organs (5Briskin M.J. McEvoy L.M. Butcher E.C. Nature. 1993; 363: 461-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The interaction between MAdCAM-1 and integrin α4β7 is the key step in lymphocyte homing to gut and plays vital roles in both gut mucosal immune homeostasis and intestinal inflammation (6Adams D.H.

Bertagnolli M. Kenney C.J. Briskin M.J. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2851-2857PubMed Google Scholar). Domain swapping experiments with MAdCAM-1 and VCAM-1 have demonstrated the requirement of the two Ig domains of MAdCAM-1 for efficient integrin α4β7 binding (9Green N. Rosebrook J. Cochran N. Tan K. Wang J.H. Springer T.A. Briskin M.J. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1999; 7: 167-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of MAdCAM-1 highlights two protruding loops from the two Ig domains, the CC′ loop in D1 and DE loop in D2, which are important for the interaction between MAdCAM-1 and α4β7 (10Tan K.

The essential integrin-binding motif (LDTS) resides in the CC′ loop of MAdCAM-1 D1, and the Asp-42 in the LDTS motif serves as the primary α4β7-binding site by directly interacting with the metal ion at the metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) in the integrin β7 I domain (8Shyjan A.M.

Mutational studies suggest that some other residues in the CC′ loop of MAdCAM-1 are also involved in MAdCAM-1-α4β7 binding (9Green N. Rosebrook J. Cochran N. Tan K. Wang J.H. Springer T.A. Briskin M.J. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1999; 7: 167-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 12Viney J.L. Jones S. Chiu H.H. Lagrimas B. Renz M.E. Presta L.G. Jackson D. Hillan K.J. Lew S. Fong S. J.

The DE loop in D2 is predominated by negatively charged residues, which have been reported to play an important role in determining integrin binding specificity (15Briskin M.J. Rott L. Butcher E.C. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 719-726PubMed Google Scholar). Mutagenesis study has shown that some residues in the DE loop are important for MAdCAM-1 binding to integrin α4β7 (9Green N. Rosebrook J. Cochran N. Tan K. Wang J.H. Springer T.A. Briskin M.J. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1999; 7: 167-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).Integrins are α/β heterodimeric cell adhesion molecules that mediate cell-cell, cell-extracellular matrix, and cell-pathogen interactions and transmit signals bidirectionally across the plasma membrane (16Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6757) Google Scholar, 17Luo B.H. Carman C.V. Springer T.A. Annu. Rev.

Cell adhesion through integrin is dependent on the dynamic regulation of integrin affinity. The low-affinity integrin α4β7 mediates rolling adhesion of lymphocytes. Upon activation, α4β7 converts to a high-affinity state, which mediates firm cell adhesion. Early studies on integrin structure have revealed that integrin extracellular domains exist in at least three distinct global conformational states: bent with a closed headpiece, extended with a closed headpiece, and extended with an open headpiece, which correspond to the low-affinity, intermediate-affinity, and high-affinity states, respectively (19Arnaout M.A. Goodman S.L. Xiong J.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2007; 19: 495-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 20Xiao T. Takagi J. Coller B.S. Wang J.H. Springer T.A.

The equilibrium among these different affinity states is regulated by integrin inside-out signaling and certain extracellular stimuli, such as divalent cations (22Arnaout M.A. Mahalingam B. Xiong J.P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 381-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 23Carman C.V. Springer T.A. Curr. Opin.

When compared with the low-affinity state in Ca2+ + Mg2+, removal of Ca2+ or the addition of Mn2+ strikingly increases ligand binding affinity and adhesiveness of almost all integrins (14Chen J.

The central MIDAS is flanked by two metal ion-binding sites, the adjacent to MIDAS (ADMIDAS) site and the synergistic metal ion-binding site. The divalent cation at MIDAS directly coordinates the acidic side chain shared by all integrin ligands and is essential for integrin-ligand binding (14Chen J. Salas A. Springer T.A. Nat. Struct.

Upon activation, integrin with the bent conformation converts to the extended conformation coupled with a series of global and local conformational changes, including separation of cytoplasmic tails, extension of integrin ectodomains, swing-out of the hybrid domain, β I domain α7 helix downward movement, and conformational rearrangement at the integrin ligand-binding site around MIDAS and ADMIDAS.Despite the above advances in understanding of α4β7-binding hotspots on MAdCAM-1 and integrin conformational rearrangement during activation, the molecular basis for the recognition of MAdCAM-1 by low- and high-affinity α4β7 remains elusive. The mechanism of rolling and firm adhesion of lymphocyte mediated by α4β7 on MAdCAM-1 is not well understood.In this study, we found that the CC′ loop in D1 and DE loop in D2 of MAdCAM-1 exerted different functions in MAdCAM-1 binding to low- and high-affinity α4β7. In addition, we demonstrated that the inactive α4β7 and α4β7 activated by different stimuli might have distinct conformations with different structural requirements for MAdCAM-1 binding.RESULTSTo study the molecular basis for the recognition of MAdCAM-1 by low- and high-affinity integrin α4β7, we generated soluble human MAdCAM-1 protein (from Val-1 to Pro-315), which contains domain 1, domain 2, and mucin-like domain with C-terminal fused Fc1 and two regions of human IgG1. Because the CC′ loop in D1 of MAdCAM-1 possesses the LDTS motif, which has been implicated as the primary integrin-binding site, we first investigated the function of the CC′ loop in the binding of low- and high-affinity integrin α4β7 to MAdCAM-1 by introducing a series of single point mutations in the CC′ loop based on the MAdCAM-1 crystal structure (Fig. 1) (10Tan K.

The shear stress was incrementally increased, and the velocity of the cells remaining bound at each increment was determined. Human α4β7 293T transfectants behaved as described previously for lymphoid cells expressing α4β7 (26de Château M. Chen S. Salas A. Springer T.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13972-13979Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In 1 mm Ca2+ + 1 mm Mg2+, about 90% of the bound α4β7 transfectants rolled at the shear stress of 1 dyne/cm2 (Fig. 2A). By contrast, cells were firmly adherent in 0.5 mm Mn2+ (Fig. 2B). Rolling and firm adhesion represent the low- and high-affinity interactions of α4β7 with MAdCAM-1, respectively. As control, α4β7transfectants treated with α4β7 blocking antibody Act-1 or with 5 mm EDTA did not accumulate on MAdCAM-1 substrates (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast to the robust cell adhesion on WT MAdCAM-1, substitution of Asp-42 with Ala abolished both rolling and firm adhesion on MAdCAM-1 mediated by the low-affinity α4β7 in 1 mm Ca2+ + 1 mm Mg2+ and high-affinity α4β7 in 0.5 mm Mn2+, suggesting its essential role in integrin-ligand binding (Fig. 2, A and B).FIGURE 2Effect of the CC′ loop point mutations on α4β7-mediated cell adhesion on MAdCAM-1 substrates in shear flow. A–C, rolling and firm adhesion on MAdCAM-1 substrates of α4β7 293T stable transfectants in 1 mm Ca2+ + 1 mm Mg2+ (A), in 0.5 mm Mn2+ (B), or before and after transfection with GFP-talin-head in 1 mm Ca2+ + 1 mm Mg2+ (C). D, adhesive modality of human PBLs on MAdCAM-1 substrates in 1 mm Ca2+ + 1 mm Mg2+ before and after stimulation with SDF-1α. The number of rolling and firmly adherent cells was measured in the indicated divalent cations at a wall shear stress of 1 dyne/cm2. The experiment was performed on the surface coated with WT or mutant MAdCAM-1 (10 μg/ml). The cells preincubated with the α4β7 blocking mAb Act-1 (2 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 5 min or treated with 5 mm EDTA were used as control. Error bars are ±S.D. (n = 3).

Arg-39 and Ser-44 to Ala mutations showed less effect, which led to 70 and 80% decrease of cell adhesion to MAdCAM-1, respectively.CC′ Loop Residues Other than Asp-42 Are Not Important for MAdCAM-1 Binding to High-affinity α4β7 Activated by Mn2+In contrast to rolling cell adhesion mediated by low-affinity α4β7, the firm cell adhesion mediated by Mn2+-activated α4β7 was only slightly affected by the same mutations, except for Asp-42 (Fig. 2B). More than 70% of cell adhesion was retained when Leu-41, Thr-43, Leu-45, and Gly-46 were mutated to Ala, respectively. The rest of the mutations only caused less than 10% loss of cell adhesion in Mn2+. Thus, except for the primary MAdCAM-1-α4β7-binding site Asp-42, the rest of the CC′ residues other than Arg-39 and Ser-44 in the CC′ loop are essential for the interaction between low-affinity α4β7 and MAdCAM-1, but not required for the binding of Mn2+-activated α4β7 to MAdCAM-1.CC′ Loop Residues Other than Arg-39 and Ser-44 Are Crucial for MAdCAM-1 Interaction with High-affinity Integrin α4β7 Activated by Talin or SDF-1αBesides the unphysiological strong activation by Mn2+, integrin can be activated by more physiological pathways such as overexpression of intracellular talin or SDF-1α stimulation (34Calderwood D.A. Zent R. Grant R. Rees D.J. Hynes R.O. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28071-28074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Talin is a cytoskeletal protein that can interact with the cytoplasmic tail of the integrin β subunit and activate integrin. To investigate the influence of the CC′ loop mutations on the interaction between MAdCAM-1 and talin-activated α4β7, we overexpressed the GFP-talin-head in α4β7 293T transfectants (supplemental Fig. S1) and examined the cell adhesion behavior to WT and mutant MAdCAM-1 under flow (Fig. 2C). The firmly adherent α4β7 transfectants on WT MAdCAM-1 increased from 11 to 37% of total bound cells under the shear stress of 1 dyne/cm2 after co-transfection with GFP-talin-head, suggesting the activation of integrin α4β7 by talin. Surprisingly, unlike the mild effects of the CC′ mutations on the cell adhesion mediated by Mn2+-activated α4β7 to MAdCAM-1, the cell adhesion mediated by talin-activated α4β7 was greatly disrupted by most CC′ loop mutations. GFP-talin-head overexpression only slightly increased cell adhesion on R39A, G40A, S44A, L45A, G46A, and V48A mutants. R39A and S44A showed less effect, which led to 76 and 54% decrease of cell adhesion mediated by talin-activated α4β7 to MAdCAM-1. Thus, the above results suggest that the CC′ loop residues other than Arg-39 and Ser-44 are crucial for the recognition of MAdCAM-1 by talin-activated α4β7 and that integrin α4β7 activated by Mn2+ and talin could have different conformations with different structural requirements for MAdCAM-1 binding.Because the CC′ loop might play different roles in MAdCAM-1 interaction with Mn2+- and talin-activated α4β7, we next tested its function in the interaction between MAdCAM-1 and α4β7 activated by SDF-1α. SDF-1α can induce integrin activation through the PI3 kinase pathway by binding to CXCR4, the G protein-coupled receptor of SDF-1α (35Kunkel E.J. Butcher E.C. Immunity. 2002; 16: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 36Wright N. Hidalgo A. Rodríguez-Frade J.M. Soriano S.F. Mellado M. Parmo-Cabañas M. Briskin M.J. Teixidó J. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5268-5277Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Human PBLs were used that express high levels of integrin α4β7 (37Erle D.J. Briskin M.J. Butcher E.C. Garcia-Pardo A. Lazarovits A.I. Tidswell M. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 517-528PubMed Google Scholar) and CXCR4 (38Bleul C.C. Wu L. Hoxie J.A. Springer T.A. Mackay C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 1925-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). In contrast to the robust cell adhesion to WT MAdCAM-1 in 1 mm Ca2+ + 1 mm Mg2+, PBL adhered weakly to most CC′ loop mutants and did not adhere to D42A and T43A mutants at all (Fig. 2D). R39A and S44A mutations showed less effect, which led to 86 and 68% decrease of cell adhesion to MAdCAM-1, respectively. Activation of α4β7 by SDF1-α stimulation notably increased the number of PBLs bound to WT MAdCAM-1, but not to the MAdCAM-1 CC′ loop mutants, suggesting the importance of the CC′ loop residues in the interaction between MAdCAM-1 and α4β7 activated by SDF1-α (Fig. 2D). Interestingly, cell adhesion to the MAdCAM-1 CC′ loop mutants could be increased by talin but not SDF1-α, indicating the subtle difference between integrins activated by talin and SDF-1α (Fig. 2, C and D).Taken together, the above data demonstrate that Asp-42 in the CC′ loop is essential for MAdCAM-1 binding to both low-affinity and high-affinity α4β7, and the rest of the CC′ loop residues other than Arg-39 and Ser-44 are crucial for MAdCAM-1 binding to α4β7 activated by physiological stimuli as SDF-1α or talin, but not required for MAdCAM-1 binding to α4β7 activated by Mn2+. Thus, integrins activated by distinct stimuli might have different high-affinity conformations with diverse structural requirements for MAdCAM-1 binding.CC′ Loop Is Required for the Stable Interaction between MAdCAM-1 and Low-affinity Integrin α4β7To test the effect of the CC′ loop on the strength of α4β7-mediated cell adhesion to MAdCAM-1, we examined the resistance of adherent cells to detachment by increasing shear stress (Fig. 3). MAdCAM-1 R39A and S44A mutants were chosen for studies on low-affinity α4β7 in Ca2+ + Mg2+ and high-affinity α4β7 activated by talin or SDF-1α because they were the only CC′ loop mutants supporting clearly detectable cell adhesion under those conditions. In 1 mm Ca2+ + 1 mm Mg2+, α4β7 293T transfectants detached more rapidly from the R39A and S44A mutants than from the WT MAdCAM-1 (Fig. 3A), suggesting the less stable interaction between integrin and the mutant ligands. In contrast, adhesion of cells bearing high-affinity α4β7 activated by Mn2+, talin, or SDF-1α to the MAdCAM-1 CC′ loop mutants was much less susceptible to the increased shear stress (Fig. 3, B–D).FIGURE 3Effect of the CC′ loop mutation on the strength of α4β7-mediated adhesion to MAdCAM-1. A–C, resistance to detachment of α4β7 293T transfectants at increasing wall shear stresses in 1 mm Ca2+ + 1 mm Mg2+ (A), in 0.5 mm Mn2+ (B), or in 1 mm Ca2+ + 1 mm Mg2+ after transfection with GFP-talin-head (C). D, resistance to detachment of human PBL stimulated with SDF-1α in 1 mm Ca2+ + 1 mm Mg2+. The total number of cells remaining bound at each indicated wall shear stress was determined as a percentage of adherent cells at 1 dyne/cm2. The experiment was performed on the surface coated with WT or mutant MAdCAM-1 (10 μg/ml). Error bars are ±S.D.

MAdCAM-1 with deletion of the whole DE loop (from Glu-149 to Asp-158) could not be expressed. All of the single amino acid substitutions by Ala in the DE loop (residue 149–158) decreased the cell adhesion mediated by both low-affinity and high-affinity α4β7 on MAdCAM-1, but to a different extent (Fig. 4A). For the rolling cell adhesion mediated by low-affinity α4β7 on MAdCAM-1 in 1 mm Ca2+ + 1 mm Mg2+, substitution of Glu-152 and Glu-153 by Ala led to an ∼70 and 60% decrease of adherent cells, respectively. E150A, E154A, and D158A showed less effect, which resulted in an ∼50% decrease (Fig. 4A). Other point mutations had even milder impact, retaining from 60 to 80% of adherent cells. For the firm cell adhesion mediated by high-affinity α4β7 in Mn2+, most DE loop point mutations showed much milder effects, except for Glu-150 and Glu-154, which led to 50 and 40% decrease of bound cells, respectively (Fig. 4B). Notably, the DE loop residues that mostly affected MAdCAM-1 interaction with low-affinity and high-affinity α4β7 are different, suggesting the different roles of the DE loop residues in the recognition of integrin α4β7 before and after activation. Different from single amino acid substitutions, the partial deletion of the DE loop abolished the interaction between low-affinity α4β7 and MAdCAM-1, but only caused about 60% loss of cell adhesion to MAdCAM-1 mediated by the Mn2+-activated α4β7. The data demonstrate that the intact DE loop is essential to MAdCAM-1 binding to low-affinity α4β7, but not to high-affinity α4β7 activated by Mn2+.FIGURE 4Effect of the DE loop point mutations on α4β7-mediated cell adhesion on MAdCAM-1 substrates in shear flow. A and B, rolling and firm adhesion on MAdCAM-1 substrates of α4β7 293T transfectants in 1 mm Ca2+ + 1 mm Mg2+ (A) and 0.5 mm Mn2+ (B). The number of rolling and firmly adherent α4β7 293T transfectants was measured in the indicated divalent cations at a wall shear stress of 1 dyne/cm2. The experiment was performed on the surface coated with WT or mutant MAdCAM-1 (10 μg/ml). The cells preincubated with the α4β7 blocking mAb Act-1 (2 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 5 min or treated with 5 mm EDTA were used as control. Error bars are ±S.D.

Opposite to the partial rescued cell adhesion to ΔDE MAdCAM-1 after α4β7 was activated by Mn2+, the activation of α4β7 by either talin or SDF-1α did not rescue the abolishment of cell adhesion by DE loop deletion in 1 mm Ca2+ + 1 mm Mg2+ (Fig. 5). Thus, the intact DE loop is important for MAdCAM-1 interaction with both low-affinity and high-affinity integrin α4β7 activated by talin or SDF-1α. On the other hand, α4β7 activated by Mn2+ could support decent cell adhesion to MAdCAM-1 in the absence of the intact DE loop, suggesting that the conformation of Mn2+-activated α4β7 may be different from those of the low-affinity and high-affinity α4β7 activated by more physiological stimuli. The overexpression of GFP-talin-head augmented the firm adhesion of α4β7 293T transfectants on both WT and DE loop single residue mutant MAdCAM-1 (Fig. 5A). In contrast, SDF-1α stimulation increased the PBL adhesion only to the WT MAdCAM-1, but not to the DE loop mutants (Fig. 5B). These data suggest that the residues in the DE loop might be involved in distinguishing the subtle difference between α4β7 activated by talin and α4β7 activated by SDF-1α.FIGURE 5Effect of DE loop mutations on MAdCAM-1 binding to integrin α4β7 activated by talin or SDF-1α.
