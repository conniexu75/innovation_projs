https://openalex.org/W1975164934,Confusion due to the conceptual usage of classic North American Pleistocene stage terms indicates the need for a new or revised terminology. The Pliocene-Pleistocene boundary has tentatively been dated about 2.5 +/- 0.1 x 10(6) years. Glacial deposits in the central United States older than about 2.2 x 10(6) years may span that boundary.

Consisting generally of a double circular pattern centered on a set of orthogonal axes, the so-called pecked cross or quartered circle figure is shown to exhibit a remarkable consistency in appearance throughout its 29 reported locations, thus suggesting that it was not perfunctory. The metric properties of the symbols gleaned from field surveys are delineated, and several interpretations of their possible functions are discussed. These symbols may have been intended as astronomical orientational devices, surveyor's bench marks, calendars, or ritual games. Evidence is presented which implies that more than one and perhaps all of these functions were employed simultaneously, a view which is shown to be consistent with the cosmological attitude of the pre-Columbian people."
https://openalex.org/W1975068582,"An archaeological and metallurgical investigation was made in the Central Persian desert where diversified mineral deposits occur, the most prominent being gold, lead-silver, copper, iron, antimony, zinc, nickel and chromite. Evidence of heating copper in crucibles in the 5th millenium B.C. Has been found at Tal-i-Iblis in Kerman (the ancient Carmania) province, which also yields old mines and slag heaps. The more easily available cerussite (PbCO 3 ) was used as lead ore before the more deeply located and less readily smelted galena (PbS). The lead mines were a source of Pb and Ag in ancient times and some are mined today for Zn, which was formerly considered an impurity. Fumes of zinc oxide as by-product of lend smelting furnaces in this area were mentioned by Marco Polo who used the early name tutiya. The hypothesis that the use of iron ore in smelting lead was a factor in the discovery of iron still has not been proved. The copper-stained crucibles found at Iblis were probably used for casting rather than smelting; the crucible melted in an experiment in which a temperature of more than 1200°C was reached over a charcoal fire in forming a copper bead."

The vapor invariably condensed as smoke-sized particles of silicon sesquioxide, Si2O3. The condensation of a solid whose composition differs from that of the parent gas and is apparently the least stable of the three solid species illustrates the importance of specific nucleation effects in the condensation process. This result has significant implications for theories of formation of grains in space."
https://openalex.org/W2053628407,Many of the observed properties of Jupiter's decametric radiation may be explained by postulation that the inner Galilean satellites of Jupiter have magnetic properties that strongly distort Jupiter's magnetic field in the region of each satellite. Charged particles from Jupiter's radiation belts are trapped by these distorted fields and emit synchrotron radiation.
https://openalex.org/W2002786277,"Industrial organizations, academic institutions, and national governments should agree on the cooperative roles each will play in planning the decadesahead raw materials needs of the chemical industry, which is vital to a modern, international economic system. The raw material future of the industry depends as much on political and social concerns as it does on technical and economic considerations. The generation in charge now cannot in good conscience go on consuming the world's supply of hydrocarbons and not acknowledge a duty to generations that will follow."

https://openalex.org/W2007771679,"I wish to express my disappointment that
Cipra's article could appear in Science. It is
best described as extravagant advertising of
unconfirmed ideas. Howlers such as measuring
the slope of the deviation function instead
of that of the log law of the wall and
concluding that the classical theory is in
error by 65% is something even my undergraduate students would find hard to believe."
https://openalex.org/W2012687755,"The highest award to which a mathematician can aspire is the Fields Medal, an award comparable in many respects to a Nobel Prize in the prestige it confers. J.C. Fields, who set up a trust for the gold medals that constitute the award, said only that they should be made ""in recognition of work already done and as an encouragement for further achievements on the part of the recipient."" This has been interpreted to mean that the medals should be given to young mathematicians (generally those under the age of 40), a tradition that has been closely followed since the first two medals were awarded in 1936. The Fields Medals are given out only every 4 years, at the quadrennial convening of the International Congress of Mathematicians. This year, Fields Medals were presented to Gregory A. Margoulis of the Soviet Union, Daniel Quillan of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Charles Fefferman of Princeton University, and Pierre Deligne of the Institute des Hautes Etudes Scientifiques in France."

https://openalex.org/W2143858734,"The description of the so-called California Civil Rights Initiative in Marcia Barinaga's article “Backlash strikes at affirmative action program” (“Maintaining diversity in science,” 29 Mar., p. 1908) does not mention a “stealth clause” (section c) that drastically dilutes protection against discrimination by gender. Discrimination against women and girls would be permitted if “reasonably necessary to the normal operation of public employment, public education or public contracting.” Such discrimination is currently legal only if related to some compelling public purpose, which is a much more stringent criterion. Math programs aimed at girls and counseling, outreach, and support programs aimed at college women, not to mention recruitment and support in the workplace, could all disappear."

https://openalex.org/W1966973800,"If an electron could be introduced into the
nucleus of a lithium atom, a nucleus would be
obtained which would possess the same resultant
charge as a helium nucleus; if two electrons
were introduced the nucleus that resulted
would have the same charge as a hydrogen
nucleus. Both of these products are gases the
spectroscopic tests for which are of exceeding
delicacy. It consequently does not appear entirely
futile to subject lithium to bombardment
by a stream of electrons traveling with a high
velocity in the hope of causing some of them
to penetrate the lithium nucleus. Experiments
to this end were undertaken by the writer
three years ago in the laboratory of Inorganic
Chemistry of the Department of Chemistry,
Cornell University. At that time it was hoped
to be able to pursue the subject further with
more powerful apparatus; that possibility now
seems far distant so that it may not be amiss
to record briefly the results of the preliminary
experiments then made."
