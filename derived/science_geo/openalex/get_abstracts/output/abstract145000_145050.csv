https://openalex.org/W2140142910,"We spatially and temporally mapped brain maturation between adolescence and young adulthood using a whole-brain, voxel-by-voxel statistical analysis of high-resolution structural magnetic resonance images (MRI). The pattern of brain maturation during these years was distinct from earlier development, and was localized to large regions of dorsal, medial and orbital frontal cortex and lenticular nuclei, with relatively little change in any other location. This spatial and temporal pattern agrees with convergent findings from post-mortem studies of brain development and the continued development over this age range of cognitive functions attributed to frontal structures."

https://openalex.org/W1979612739,"Cell proliferation requires cell growth; that is, cells only divide after they reach a critical size. However, the mechanisms by which cells grow and maintain their appropriate size have remained elusive. Drosophila deficient in the S6 kinase gene (dS6K) exhibited an extreme delay in development and a severe reduction in body size. These flies had smaller cells rather than fewer cells. The effect was cell-autonomous, displayed throughout larval development, and distinct from that of ribosomal protein mutants (Minutes). Thus, the dS6K gene product regulates cell size in a cell-autonomous manner without impinging on cell number."
https://openalex.org/W1997392514,"What aspects of movement are represented in the primary motor cortex (M1): relatively low-level parameters like muscle force, or more abstract parameters like handpath? To examine this issue, the activity of neurons in M1 was recorded in a monkey trained to perform a task that dissociates three major variables of wrist movement: muscle activity, direction of movement at the wrist joint, and direction of movement in space. A substantial group of neurons in M1 (28 out of 88) displayed changes in activity that were muscle-like. Unexpectedly, an even larger group of neurons in M1 (44 out of 88) displayed changes in activity that were related to the direction of wrist movement in space independent of the pattern of muscle activity that generated the movement. Thus, both ""muscles"" and ""movements"" appear to be strongly represented in M1."

The cytoplasmic protein, talin, binds to β integrin cytoplasmic tails and actin filaments, hence forming an integrin-cytoskeletal linkage. We used recombinant structural mimics of β1A, β1D and β3integrin cytoplasmic tails to characterize integrin-binding sites within talin. Here we report that an integrin-binding site is localized within the N-terminal talin head domain. The binding of the talin head domain to integrin β tails is specific in that it is abrogated by a single point mutation that disrupts integrin localization to talin-rich focal adhesions. Integrin-cytoskeletal interactions regulate integrin affinity for ligands (activation). Overexpression of a fragment of talin containing the head domain led to activation of integrin αIIbβ3; activation was dependent on the presence of both the talin head domain and the integrin β3 cytoplasmic tail. The head domain of talin thus binds to integrins to form a link to the actin cytoskeleton and can thus regulate integrin function.

The connection of integrin adhesion receptors to the actin cytoskeleton regulates cell shape, adhesion, and migration (1Schoenwaelder S.M. Burridge K. Curr. Opin.

Talin, a cytoplasmic protein composed of ∼270-kDa subunits binds to integrin β cytoplasmic tails, vinculin and actin filaments (2Pfaff M. Liu S. Erle D.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol.

Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 463-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar). It plays an important role in the establishment and maintenance of integrin-cytoskeleton connections, and loss of talin expression leads to impaired cell adhesion, spreading, and migration (8Priddle H. Hemmings L. Monkley S. Woods A. Patel B. Sutton D. Dunn G.A. Zicha D. Critchley D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1121-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Talin consists of an N-terminal ∼50-kDa globular head domain and an ∼220-kDa C-terminal rod domain (9Rees D.J. Ades S.E. Singer S.J. Hynes R.O. Nature. 1990; 347: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The N-terminal talin head domain contains an ∼200-residue region similar to a region within the membrane-binding N-terminal ERM association domain (N-ERMAD) in the ezrin, radixin, and moesin (ERM) family of proteins (9Rees D.J. Ades S.E. Singer S.J. Hynes R.O. Nature. 1990; 347: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The N-ERMAD domain of ERM proteins binds to the cytoplasmic domain of transmembrane receptors (e.g. CD44), and the C-terminal domain binds to actin, linking the receptor to the cytoskeleton (10Mangeat P. Roy C. Martin M. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 187-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). In contrast to ERM proteins, previous studies indicate that the C-terminal rod domain of talin contains the integrin-binding site and the vinculin- and actin-binding sites (5Hemmings L. Rees D.J. Ohanian V. Bolton S.J. Gilmore A.P. Patel B. Priddle H. Trevithick J.E. Hynes R.O. Critchley D.R. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2715-2726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Muguruma M. Nishimuta S.

Nature. 1986; 320: 531-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). Thus, talin might differ from other ERM proteins in the manner in which it connects membrane proteins to actin filaments. Talin binds to recombinant structural mimics of dimerized integrin β cytoplasmic tails (2Pfaff M. Liu S. Erle D.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6104-6109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Here, we examined the interaction of the talin head domain with three of these integrin β cytoplasmic tails and report that either recombinant or proteolytically derived talin head domains bind specifically to all three β tails. Furthermore, overexpression of the talin fragments containing the head domain “activated” integrin αIIbβ3 as judged by increased ligand-binding affinity. Consequently, the talin head domain binds to several integrin β tails and can thus mediate the linkage of these integrins to the actin cytoskeleton and modulate integrin function.

Following lysis, CompleteTM protease inhibitor mixture, E-64 (0.1 mm final), and EDTA (2 mm final) were added to the inhibitor-free sample. CHO cells stably expressing human integrin αIIbβ3 or αIIbβ3Δ728 (15Ylanne J. Chen Y.-P. O'Toole T.E. Loftus J.C. Takada Y. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) were transfected using lipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.), and activation of αIIbβ3 was assayed by PAC1 binding as described previously (12O'Toole T.E. Katagiri Y. Faull R.J. Peter K. Tamura R.N. Quaranta V. Loftus J.C. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1047-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Recombinant integrin cytoplasmic tails were expressed, purified and characterized as described previously (2Pfaff M. Liu S. Erle D.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6104-6109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). GST-talin fusion proteins were expressed and purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Affinity chromatography was performed using recombinant integrin cytoplasmic tails bound to His-Bind® Resin (Novagen). Binding of 200 μl of cell lysate, or 20 μl of purified GST-talin fragments, to 50 μl of coated resin was performed in a total volume of 800 μl as described previously (2Pfaff M. Liu S. Erle D.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6104-6109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Bound proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting. Binding of recombinant integrin tails to the resin was verified by Coomassie Blue staining. Talin, a large cytoskeletal actin-binding protein, binds to the muscle-specific integrin β1D cytoplasmic tail (2Pfaff M. Liu S. Erle D.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6104-6109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). To determine which domains of talin bind, we permitted endogenous platelet calpain to cleave talin into an ∼50-kDa head domain and an ∼220-kDa rod domain (Ref. 9Rees D.J. Ades S.E. Singer S.J. Hynes R.O. Nature. 1990; 347: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar; Fig.1 A). In the presence of calpain inhibitors, intact talin resulted in a band with an apparent molecular mass of 240 kDa that reacted with antibodies specific for the talin head (TA205) and rod (8d4) domains. Platelet lysis in the absence of calpain inhibitors resulted in the complete disappearance of the intact talin and generation of a 50-kDa, TA205-binding, head domain and an apparent 190-kDa, 8d4-reactive, rod domain (Fig. 1 B). The discrepancy between the predicted and apparent molecular masses of both intact talin and the talin rod domain is consistent with previous reports (9Rees D.J. Ades S.E. Singer S.J. Hynes R.O. Nature. 1990; 347: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). β1D affinity chromatography revealed binding of both head and rod domains (Fig. 1 C). Binding of both domains was specific in that it was abrogated by a tyrosine to alanine (Y/A) substitution in the first NPXY motif of β1D (Figs. 1 C and 2 A). Mutation of this residue in β1A or β1D inhibited binding of full-length talin (data not shown) (2Pfaff M. Liu S. Erle D.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6104-6109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Thus both domains of talin bind to a β1D affinity matrix. Talin also binds to β1A and β3 cytoplasmic tails, (2Pfaff M. Liu S. Erle D.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6104-6109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 3Knezevic I. Leisner T. Lam S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16416-16421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). However, binding to β1A is weaker than to β1D and β3 (Ref. 2Pfaff M. Liu S. Erle D.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6104-6109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar and data not shown). We therefore tested whether the same talin domains bound to β1A and β3 cytoplasmic tails. Both head and rod domains bound to β1A and β3 (Fig.2 B). Furthermore, the relative binding of each domain was similar to that of intact talin (data not shown). Substitution of Ala for Tyr in the membrane-proximal NPXY motif inhibited binding of both full-length talin (data not shown), and head and rod domains (Fig. 2 B). Talin forms antiparallel homodimers (6Muguruma M. Nishimuta S. Tomisaka Y. Ito T. Matsumura S. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1995; 117: 1036-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and previous work (11Horwitz A. Duggan K. Buck C.A. Beckerle M.C. Burridge K. Nature. 1986; 320: 531-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar) implicated the rod domain as the integrin-binding site. Consequently, the head domain could have bound through an association with intact integrin-bound talin. However, the absence of intact talin in the lysates (Fig. 1 B) suggests that binding of the isolated domains is not mediated through their dimerization with full-length talin. Furthermore, localization of the dimerization domains to the central region of the rod domain (6Muguruma M. Nishimuta S. Tomisaka Y. Ito T. Matsumura S. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1995; 117: 1036-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) suggests that the head and rod domains do not associate following calpain cleavage. In support of this hypothesis, head and rod domains did not co-immunoprecipitate from calpain-cleaved lysates using either 8d4 or TA205 as precipitating antibodies (data not shown). Consequently, the binding of both head and rod domains to integrins probably represents independent interactions. Independent binding of the head and tail domains would explain the observation that integrin αIIbβ3 binds to talin with a stoichiometry of 2:1 (3Knezevic I. Leisner T. Lam S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16416-16421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The experiments reported above suggested an interaction between the talin head domain and integrin β cytoplasmic tails. However, binding of the head domain could occur via a talin-binding intermediary protein present in the platelet lysate. We therefore examined the binding of purified recombinant talin head domain (talin 1–435) to β1A, β1D, and β3integrin cytoplasmic tails. Talin head domain bound to all three tails. Furthermore, Tyr to Ala mutations in the first NPXY motif inhibited binding (Fig. 3 B). In addition, GST failed to bind to any of the cytoplasmic tails, and the head domain failed to bind to the αIIb cytoplasmic tail (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the isolated talin head domain contains an integrin-binding site. To further localize the integrin binding site within the talin head domain, we investigated the binding of three overlapping talin head domain fragments to β1D cytoplasmic tails (Fig. 3,A and C). Western blotting revealed that fusion proteins of the predicted molecular mass were present (Fig.3 C). Only talin-(186–435) bound to the β1D tails, and this binding was sensitive to Tyr to Ala mutations in the β1D tail (Fig. 3 C). A similar binding pattern was seen for β1A and β3 tails (data not shown). The failure of talin-(280–435) and -(1–280) to bind integrin tails indicates that amino acids within the 186–280 region are necessary, but not sufficient, for tail binding. Further localization of the binding site within amino acids 186–435 was not possible due to the insolubility of all smaller fragments tested. Sequences within the talin head domain suggest that this region of talin is structurally related to the N-ERMAD of the ERM family of proteins (Ref. 9Rees D.J. Ades S.E. Singer S.J. Hynes R.O. Nature. 1990; 347: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar; Fig. 3 B). ERM proteins generally function as membrane-cytoskeleton linker molecules, in which the N-ERMAD domain binds to the cytoplasmic domains of transmembrane receptors, while the C-terminal, C-ERMAD binds filamentous actin (10Mangeat P. Roy C. Martin M. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 187-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Talin resembles ERM family members in the interaction of its head domain with membranes by binding to phospholipids (6Muguruma M. Nishimuta S. Tomisaka Y. Ito T. Matsumura S. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1995; 117: 1036-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and to the cytoplasmic domain of layilin, a transmembrane protein (14Borowsky M.L. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 429-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the talin rod domain contains binding sites for filamentous actin (5Hemmings L. Rees D.J. Ohanian V. Bolton S.J. Gilmore A.P. Patel B. Priddle H. Trevithick J.E. Hynes R.O. Critchley D.R. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2715-2726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Muguruma M. Nishimuta S. Tomisaka Y. Ito T. Matsumura S. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1995; 117: 1036-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, talin is concentrated at focal adhesions, sites devoid of layilin (14Borowsky M.L. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 429-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Our finding that talin can bind to integrin β cytoplasmic tails via its head domain, and that the integrin- binding site maps to a fragment containing most of the ERM domain, suggests that this interaction is involved in the linkage of actin filaments to integrins in a manner analogous to other ERM proteins. In addition, the head domain localizes to focal adhesions (16Nuckolls G.H. Turner C.E. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1635-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and microinjection of the anti-head domain mAb TA205, or of a recombinant talin fragment containing the TA205 epitope (residues 102–497), disrupts stress fibers (5Hemmings L. Rees D.J. Ohanian V. Bolton S.J. Gilmore A.P. Patel B. Priddle H. Trevithick J.E. Hynes R.O. Critchley D.R. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2715-2726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Bolton S.J. Barry S.T. Mosley H. Patel B. Jockusch B.M. Wilkinson J.M. Critchley D.R. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1997; 36: 363-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, the talin head domain is implicated in linkage of integrins to the actin cytoskeleton. Increases in integrin affinity for ligands (“activation”) can be influenced by cytoskeletal linkages (4Sampath R. Gallagher P.J. Pavalko F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33588-33594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar,18Elemer G.S. Edgington T.S. J. Biol.

We reasoned that if the talin head domain bound to integrin cytoplasmic tails, then overexpression of talin fragments containing this domain might alter integrin affinity. We, therefore, expressed N-terminal fragments of talin (Fig.4 A) and assessed the activation state of αIIbβ3 by measuring binding of the activation-specific mAb PAC1 (12O'Toole T.E. Katagiri Y. Faull R.J. Peter K. Tamura R.N. Quaranta V. Loftus J.C. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1047-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). CHO cells expressing recombinant human integrin αIIbβ3 were co-transfected with talin-(1–1071) cDNA along with Tac α5 as a marker of transfection. Cells expressing high levels of the transfection marker (FL-2) exhibited increased PAC1 binding (FL-1), resulting in a rightward tilt in the density plot (Fig. 4 B). This effect was not seen if the expressed talin fragment lacked the head domain (talin-(434–1071)) or with vector DNA (Fig. 4,A and B). Talin-(1–1071)-induced PAC1 binding was inhibited by the αIIbβ3 antagonist, Ro43-5054, demonstrating the specificity of binding (data not shown). Expression of talin-(1–1071) resulted in a 2.7-fold increase in mean activation index (from 0.21 to 0.56), while a fragment lacking the head domain, talin-(434–1071), had little effect (activation index: 0.18) (Fig. 4 D). These fragments had no obvious effect on cell shape (data not shown), consistent with previous results obtained by microinjection of recombinant talin-(102–497) (5Hemmings L. Rees D.J. Ohanian V. Bolton S.J. Gilmore A.P. Patel B. Priddle H. Trevithick J.E. Hynes R.O. Critchley D.R. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2715-2726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the talin fragments was confirmed by Western blotting with mAb 8d4, which recognizes endogenous hamster talin and both recombinant mouse talin fragments (Fig. 4 C). Densitrometry of the blot shown in Fig.4 C revealed that the intensities of signal from talin-(1–1071) and talin-(434–1071) were 0.66 and 1.36 times, respectively, the intensity of the endogenous talin band. However, these fragments are only expressed in the transfected cells. Thus, we calculated that on a per cell basis talin-(1–1071) was 2-fold and talin-(434–1071) was 6-fold overexpressed with respect to endogenous talin, based on transfection efficiencies of 29 and 22%, respectively. We were unable to test whether overexpression of intact talin or isolated head domain results in similar integrin activation as we detected no increase in their expression following transient transfection with cDNAs encoding them in either pJ6 R or pcDNA3.1 expression vectors. To determine whether the αIIbβ3 activation by talin-(1–1071) required the talin-binding β3cytoplasmic tail, we tested CHO cells expressing αIIbβ3Δ728, which lacks the C-terminal 35 amino acids of the β3 subunit (15Ylanne J. Chen Y.-P. O'Toole T.E. Loftus J.C. Takada Y. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Loss of the β3 cytoplasmic tail results in an integrin that is deficient in cytoskeletal interactions, will not support cell spreading or initiation of focal adhesions, and which is not recruited to existing focal adhesions (15Ylanne J.

As shown in Fig. 4 Dexpression of talin-(1–1071) did not activate αIIbβ3Δ728 in CHO cells; however, αIIbβ3Δ728 could be activated exogenously by addition of the activating mAb anti-LIBS6 (data not shown (12O'Toole T.E. Katagiri Y. Faull R.J. Peter K. Tamura R.N. Quaranta V. Loftus J.C. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1047-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar)). Consequently, expression of fragments of talin containing the head domain can increase the ligand-binding affinity of integrin αIIbβ3 when the integrin contains an intact β3 cytoplasmic tail. Following platelet activation talin is redistributed from the cytoplasm to the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane (21Beckerle M.C. Miller D.E. Bertagnolli M.E. Locke S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3333-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that it plays a role in the regulation of adhesive functions of platelets. The data presented above implicate talin in the regulation of αIIbβ3 ligand binding affinity; however, the molecular mechanism of this regulation remains unclear. Intact talin binding to integrin β tails via its head domain may retain the integrin in an inactive state (4Sampath R. Gallagher P.J. Pavalko F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33588-33594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), and the isolated fragment may break these tethers and so activate the integrin (19Lub M. van Kooyk Y. van Vliet S.J. Figdor C.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 20Kucik D.F. Dustin M.L. Miller J.M. Brown E.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2139-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Alternatively, talin binding may alter integrin affinity through direct conformational changes or clustering the integrin. Additional studies are under way to distinguish among these potential mechanisms. In conclusion, we have found (i) that the talin head domain contains a binding site for the cytoplasmic tails of integrins β1A, β1D, and β3 and (ii) that expression of a talin fragment containing the head domain activates integrin αIIbβ3 in a manner dependent on the β3 cytoplasmic tail. Identification of an integrin-binding site in the talin head domain is consistent with talin's similarity to the ERM family of proteins. Thus, the talin head domain can form an integrin-binding element in a physical link between integrins and the actin cytoskeleton. The paper by Patil et al.(Patil, S., Jedsadayanmata, A., Wencel-Drake, J. D., Wang, W., Knezevic, I., and Lam, S. C.-T. (1999) J. Biol.

Many details of the interactions between tRNA and the ribosome, and of the packing arrangements of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) helices in and between the ribosomal subunits, can be seen. Numerous contacts are made between the 30 S subunit and the P-tRNA anticodon stem-loop; in contrast, the anticodon region of A-tRNA is much more exposed. A complex network of molecular interactions suggestive of a functional relay is centered around the long penultimate stem of 16 S rRNA at the subunit interface, including interactions involving the “switch” helix and decoding site of 16 S rRNA, and RNA bridges from the 50 S subunit."

The peak width or inverse lifetime of the excitation displays a linear temperature dependence, independent of binding energy, for small energies, and a linear energy dependence, independent of temperature, for large binding energies. This behavior is unaffected by the superconducting transition, which is an indication that the nodal states play no role in the superconductivity. Temperature-dependent scaling suggests that the system displays quantum critical behavior."

Here it is shown that Pten heterozygous ( Pten +/− ) mutants develop a lethal polyclonal autoimmune disorder with features reminiscent of those observed in Fas-deficient mutants. Fas-mediated apoptosis was impaired in Pten +/− mice, and T lymphocytes from these mice show reduced activation-induced cell death and increased proliferation upon activation. Phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase inhibitors restored Fas responsiveness in Pten +/− cells. These results indicate that Pten is an essential mediator of the Fas response and a repressor of autoimmunity and thus implicate the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway in Fas-mediated apoptosis."

https://openalex.org/W2038347400,"ClpB is a heat-shock protein fromEscherichia coli with an unknown function. We studied a possible molecular chaperone activity of ClpB in vitro. Firefly luciferase was denatured in urea and then diluted into the refolding buffer (in the presence of 5 mm ATP and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). Spontaneous reactivation of luciferase was very weak (less than 0.02% of the native activity) because of extensive aggregation. Conventional chaperone systems (GroEL/GroES and DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE) or ClpB alone did not reactivate luciferase under those conditions. However, ClpB together with DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE greatly enhanced the luciferase activity regain (up to 57% of native activity) by suppressing luciferase aggregation. This coordinated function of ClpB and DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE required ATP hydrolysis, although the ClpB ATPase was not activated by native or denatured luciferase. When the chaperones were added to the luciferase refolding solutions after 5–25 min of refolding, ClpB and DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE recovered the luciferase activity from preformed aggregates. Thus, we have identified a novel multi-chaperone system from E. coli, which is analogous to the Hsp104/Ssa1/Ydj1 system from yeast.

ClpB is the only known bacterial Hsp100 protein capable of cooperating with other heat-shock proteins in suppressing and reversing protein aggregation. Clp ATPases (also referred to as Hsp100 proteins) are involved in protein degradation and disaggregation in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells (1Schirmer E.C. Glover J.R. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 289-296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 2Gottesman S. Wickner S. Maurizi M.R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 815-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, the Clp family consists of several closely related protein-activated ATPases that associate with peptidase subunits to form ATP-dependent protease complexes. Among the identified members of the Clp family, ClpA and ClpX interact with and stimulate ClpP peptidase, whereas ClpY combines with a different peptidase, ClpQ (2Gottesman S. Wickner S. Maurizi M.R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 815-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). ClpB, despite a 42% sequence identity and 64% sequence similarity with ClpA (3Gottesman S. Squires C. Pichersky E. Carrington M. Hobbs M. Mattick J.S. Dalrymple B. Kuramitsu H. Shiroza T. Foster T. Clark W.P. Ross B. Squires C.L. Maurizi M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1992; 267: 20429-20434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ClpA and ClpX have chaperone-like activities in vitro, which suggests that their role in complexes with ClpP is to bind improperly folded or partially aggregated protein substrates and to deliver substrates to the peptidase. ClpX protects the bacteriophage λO protein from thermally induced aggregation (5Wawrzynow A. Wojtkowiak D. Marszalek J. Banecki B. Jonsen M. Graves B. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1867-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). ClpA converts inactive dimers of RepA into active monomers (6Wickner S. Gottesman S. Skowyra D. Hoskins J. McKenney K. Maurizi M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12218-12222Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Unlike ClpA, ClpB does not disassemble RepA dimers (6Wickner S. Gottesman S. Skowyra D. Hoskins J. McKenney K. Maurizi M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12218-12222Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). A yeast homolog of ClpA and ClpB, Hsp104, resolubilizes heat-induced protein aggregates in yeast cells (7Parsell D.A. Kowal A.S. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Nature. 1994; 372: 475-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). This activity requires a cooperation between Hsp104 and two other yeast heat-shock proteins: Ydj1 (Hsp40) and Ssa1 (Hsp70) (8Glover J.R. Lindquist S. Cell. 1998; 94: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar). Interestingly, DnaK, an E. coli homolog of Ssa1, does not support protein disaggregation by Hsp104 and Ydj1 (8Glover J.R. Lindquist S. Cell. 1998; 94: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar). Thus, it has not been known if protein disaggregating chaperone systems, similar to that found in yeast, exist in prokaryotes. Among E. coli Clp ATPases, ClpB is the most inadequately characterized, and its possible functional role and potential protein substrates are unknown. ClpB is essential for survival of E. coli cells at high temperatures (9Squires C.L. Pedersen S. Ross B.M. Squires C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4254-4262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Thomas J.G. Baneyx F. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5165-5172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which suggests that ClpB may play a major role in the bacterial stress-response machinery. In this study, we tested whether purified ClpB has a molecular chaperone activity in vitro. We studied the refolding of firefly luciferase under the conditions of intense aggregation that could not be prevented by the conventional E. coli chaperones (GroEL/GroES or DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE). We found that there is a close similarity between the chaperone activities of ClpB and Hsp104. Like Hsp104, ClpB cooperates with another group of chaperones (DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE) to suppress and reverse aggregation of a protein substrate. Thus, we have identified a novel highly efficient multi-chaperone system in E. coli. While this article was in review, Motohashi et al. (11Motohashi K. Watanabe Y. Yohda M. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7184-7189Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) reported identification of a chaperone system consisting of the ClpB, DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE homologs from Thermus thermophilus. Those results, as well as ours, indicate that a functional cooperation between Hsp100, Hsp70, and Hsp40 families occurs not only in eukaryotes but also in prokaryotes. ClpB was overexpressed in E. coli and purified according to the procedure used to obtain ClpA (12Maurizi M.R. Thompson M.W. Singh S.K. Kim S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 314-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) with small modifications (23Zolkiewski, M., Kessel, M., Ginsburg, A., and Maurizi, M. R. (1999) Protein Sci., in pressGoogle Scholar). ClpB stock solution was prepared by dialysis against 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.2 m KCl, 10% glycerol, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT. 1The abbreviations used are:DTTdithiothreitolATPγSadenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate)BSAbovine serum albumin Concentration of ClpB was measured using the calculated absorption coefficient A280 = 0.38 cm2/mg (13Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray Y. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3472) Google Scholar). ClpB, like other Hsp100 proteins, forms hexamers (522 kDa) in the presence of ATP (23Zolkiewski, M., Kessel, M., Ginsburg, A., and Maurizi, M. R. (1999) Protein Sci., in pressGoogle Scholar). Thus, concentrations throughout this paper are given for ClpB hexamers. dithiothreitol adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) bovine serum albumin Recombinant firefly luciferase (61 kDa) was purchased from Promega (Madison, Wisconsin). Other E. coli chaperones (DnaK, 69 kDa; DnaJ, 41 kDa; GrpE, 24 kDa; GroEL, 14-mer, 802 kDa; GroES, heptamer, 72 kDa) were obtained from StressGen Biotechnologies(Victoria, BC, Canada). Concentrations of luciferase and chaperone stock solutions were determined by the suppliers. Bovine serum albumin was from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA), and κ-casein was from Sigma. Luciferase (15 mg/ml) was diluted 100-fold into the denaturation buffer (30 mmHepes, pH 7.65, 60 mm KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm DTT) containing 7 m urea and incubated for 30–45 min at room temperature. For refolding, the denatured luciferase was rapidly diluted 100-fold into the renaturation buffer (30 mm Hepes, pH 7.65, 120 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml BSA). Luciferase assay system was purchased from Promega. Luciferase samples were diluted with the buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and 1 mg/ml BSA to stabilize luciferase activity at very low concentrations. After adding 1 μl of luciferase to 50 μl of assay solution in a small tube, the tube was placed in an empty scintillation vial, and the luminescence was measured over 2 min with a Beckman LS 3801 scintillation counter. The scintillation counter was calibrated with samples of native luciferase of known concentration. With appropriate dilutions, the above method gave accurate results down to ∼0.1 pg of active luciferase per assay. Refolding solutions containing luciferase were electrophoresed in a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel in the presence of SDS and electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The blot was incubated with 0.2 μg/ml anti-luciferase antibody (Sigma) for 1 h, then with anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Promega), and was visualized using a chemiluminescence detection kit (Pierce). The band intensity was integrated using Scion Image software (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD). The rate of ATP hydrolysis by ClpB was determined in 50 μl of the assay solution (100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, in some experiments supplemented with other proteins (see Table II)) containing 0.9 μg of ClpB. After 15 min incubation at 37 °C, the inorganic phosphate concentration was determined using the method of Hess and Derr (14Hess H.H. Derr J.E. Anal.

Firefly luciferase has been often used as a substrate in studies on chaperone function because of its tendency to aggregate after heat-shock (5Wawrzynow A. Wojtkowiak D. Marszalek J. Banecki B.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4137-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). However, the most pronounced aggregation of luciferase occurs during refolding from the completely denatured state after chemical denaturation (8Glover J.R. Lindquist S. Cell. 1998; 94: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar). Aggregates formed from completely unfolded proteins are a model system for the formation of inclusion bodies that occurs during overexpression of proteins in vivo(17Fink A.L. Folding Des. 1998; 3: R9-R23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the reactivation of luciferase during refolding after denaturation in urea. 2We found that 0.1 m guanidinium hydrochloride inhibits ∼50% of the basal ATPase activity of ClpB (not shown). However, the ClpB ATPase activity is not inhibited by urea (see Table II). Under these experimental conditions, very low luciferase activity was recovered from the refolding reaction in the absence of chaperones (less than 0.02% of the native control, see Table Ibelow). When ClpB or DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE were included in the refolding solution, no luciferase reactivation was observed (Fig. 1, Table I). However, when ClpB and DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE were present together in the refolding solution, a strong enhancement of the luciferase renaturation was found.Table IReactivation yield of luciferase in the absence and presence of ClpB and other E. coli chaperonesChaperones present (concentration in μm)Luciferase activity as percent of native controlNone<0.02DnaK (1.0), DnaJ (1.0), GrpE (1.2)<0.02GroEL (1.1), GroES (1.1)<0.02ClpB (0.33)0.03ClpB (0.33), GroEL (1.1), GroES (1.1)0.03ClpB (0.33), DnaK (1.0), DnaJ (1.0)0.25ClpB (0.33), DnaK (0.5), DnaJ (0.5), GrpE (0.5)0.17ClpB (0.33), DnaK (1.0), DnaJ (1.0), GrpE (1.2)1.56ClpB (1.3), DnaK (1.0), DnaJ (1.0), GrpE (1.2)57 ± 5ClpB (0.33), DnaJ (1.0), GrpE (1.2)0.02ClpB (0.33), DnaK (1.0), GrpE (1.2)0.02ClpB (0.33), DnaK (1.0), DnaJ (1.0), GrpE (1.2), 5 mmATPγS0.02Unfolded luciferase was diluted to 25 nm into the buffer (30 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.65, 120 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP (or ATPγS, see the table), 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml BSA) containing chaperones specified in the table. The activity of luciferase was assayed after 160 min of refolding at room temperature. Protein concentrations are given for ClpB hexamer, GroEL 14-mer, and GroES heptamer. Open table in a new tab Unfolded luciferase was diluted to 25 nm into the buffer (30 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.65, 120 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP (or ATPγS, see the table), 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml BSA) containing chaperones specified in the table. The activity of luciferase was assayed after 160 min of refolding at room temperature. Protein concentrations are given for ClpB hexamer, GroEL 14-mer, and GroES heptamer. The reactivation of luciferase by ClpB and DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE was slow at room temperature, and no activity plateau was observed after more than 3 h of refolding (Fig. 1). The rate of luciferase reactivation with ClpB, DnaK, and DnaJ was lower than the rate observed when GrpE was also included (Fig. 1). There was a “lag phase” of ∼40 min, during which the luciferase activity regain was very low even in the presence of ClpB and DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE. This suggests that luciferase may undergo repetitive cycles of binding to different chaperones before being released to solution in an active form. To test whether the low efficiency of luciferase renaturation correlates with its high aggregation propensity, we evaluated the relative amounts of soluble and insoluble luciferase in the reactions with and without ClpB. After 3 h of refolding with DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE, ∼60% of luciferase was in the form of large aggregates that could be removed by centrifugation (Fig. 2). However, such luciferase aggregates were not found when ClpB was included in the refolding reaction with DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE. This indicates that the chaperone-induced reactivation of luciferase, as shown in Fig.1, is a result of suppression of the aggregation of luciferase. Table I contains the luciferase refolding yields obtained in the presence of different sets of molecular chaperones after 160 min of refolding. The well known E. coli chaperone systems (DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE and GroEL/GroES) that suppress aggregation of many protein substrates (18Buchner J. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 10-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) are unable to increase the yield of reactivation of luciferase under the conditions used in this study (less that 0.02% of the native activity, see Table I). ClpB alone, or together with GroEL/GroES, did not increase the luciferase reactivation yield. For the significant reactivation of luciferase, it is required that ClpB is included together with DnaK and DnaJ. With 0.33 μm ClpB, 1 μm DnaK, and 1 μmDnaJ, the luciferase reactivation after 160 min increased ∼10-fold, as compared with the reactivation without chaperones (Table I). Further reactivation increase (up to ∼80-fold) was found when 1 μm GrpE was included together with ClpB, DnaK, and DnaJ. Thus, GrpE increases the reactivation rate but is not required for the luciferase reactivation (Table I and Fig. 1). However, both DnaK and DnaJ must be present, in addition to ClpB, to achieve luciferase reactivation. Very low luciferase activity was recovered (0.02% of the native control activity) when either DnaK or DnaJ were not included in the refolding solution (Table I). Among the chaperones that reactivate luciferase, ClpB and DnaK have ATPase activity (4Woo K.M. Kim K.I. Goldberg A.L. Ha D.B. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20429-20434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Liberek K. Marszalek J. Ang D. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2874-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). We found that ATP hydrolysis is required for the function of ClpB/DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE because no luciferase reactivation was observed when a nonhydrolyzable analog, ATPγS, was substituted for ATP in the refolding buffer (Table I). The ClpB/DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE-induced luciferase reactivation strongly depended on the concentration of ClpB and DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE (Table I). The luciferase reactivation yield increased ∼10-fold when the concentrations of DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE increased from 0.5 to 1 μm, and the reactivation yield increased ∼36-fold when the ClpB concentration increased from 0.33 to 1.3 μm. In these studies, the concentrations of chaperones were ∼10–50-fold higher than the concentration of luciferase. The chaperone concentration-dependent reactivation yields suggest that the efficiency of interchaperone interactions may be a critical limiting factor in the reactivation of luciferase by the ClpB/DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE system. Next, we tested whether the multi-chaperone system (ClpB/DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE) is capable of rescuing luciferase from preformed aggregates. It has been observed before that luciferase could be reactivated by the yeast chaperones (Hsp104, Ssa1, Ydj1) after aggregating for 30 min at 0 °C (8Glover J.R. Lindquist S. Cell. 1998; 94: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar). We found that large luciferase aggregates, which could be removed by centrifugation, were formed within 5 min after initialization of refolding at 0 °C without chaperones (see Fig. 3). ClpB and DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE added after 5 min of refolding were able, however, to recover active luciferase from large aggregates (compare theopen and filled bars in Fig. 3). After ∼15 min of refolding, the size and/or amount of aggregates increased to the extent that some of them became irretrievable by the chaperones. However, ClpB/DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE were able to partially reactivate luciferase even after 25 min of refolding. ClpB is a protein-activated ATPase (4Woo K.M. Kim K.I. Goldberg A.L. Ha D.B. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20429-20434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which suggests that ATP hydrolysis and the binding of a protein substrate to ClpB may be functionally coupled. We measured the rate of ATP hydrolysis by ClpB in the presence of other proteins (TableII). As observed also by previous investigators (4Woo K.M. Kim K.I. Goldberg A.L. Ha D.B. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20429-20434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the ClpB ATPase activity increased ∼13-fold in the presence of casein, a highly heterogeneous and aggregated protein (20Farrell Jr., H.M. Wickham E.D. Groves M.L. J. Dairy Sci. 1998; 81: 2974-2984Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The ClpB ATPase activation by casein was only ∼4-fold when casein had been denatured in 8 m urea and then diluted into the assay buffer (Table II). No ATPase activation was observed, however, in the presence of either native or denatured luciferase. It is known that DnaJ and GrpE efficiently stimulate the ATPase activity of DnaK (19Liberek K. Marszalek J. Ang D. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2874-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). We found that DnaJ and GrpE did not affect the ATPase activity of ClpB (Table II). These data suggest that the ClpB ATPase activity may not be stimulated during the luciferase refolding assays in Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3. Current models of the function of molecular chaperones are focused on their ability to prevent aggregation of protein substrates by binding to partially folded aggregation-prone protein conformations (18Buchner J. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 10-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Although some chaperones can rescue misfolded proteins from early reversible pre-aggregation stages, they are unable to reverse protein aggregation after it occurs (21Ranson N.A. Dunster N.J. Burston S.G. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Yeast chaperones, Hsp104, Ssa1, and Ydj1, have been the first discovered example of a cellular machinery capable of resolubilizing aggregated proteins and recovering protein activity from large aggregates (8Glover J.R. Lindquist S. Cell. 1998; 94: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar). It is also an example of functional cooperation between chaperones from different heat-shock families. Our studies identified ClpB as a member of a highly efficient molecular chaperone system in E. coli. ClpB, together with DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE, suppresses aggregation of luciferase (Figs. 1 and 2). At this time, we do not know if the above chaperones bind partially folded conformations of luciferase before it aggregates. However, our data indicate that the ClpB/DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE system is capable of reactivating luciferase after severe aggregation (Fig. 3). Because Clp ATPases and DnaJ are unstable in low ionic-strength buffers (12Maurizi M.R. Thompson M.W. Singh S.K. Kim S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 314-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 22Zylicz M. Yamamoto T. McKittrick N. Sell S. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7591-7598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we used 0.12m KCl in the luciferase refolding solution, which drastically increased aggregation of luciferase and decreased the spontaneous recovery of the luciferase activity (see Table I), as compared with the refolding conditions used in previous studies (8Glover J.R. Lindquist S. Cell. 1998; 94: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar). Neither GroEL/GroES nor DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE chaperone systems could prevent aggregation of luciferase under these conditions (Table I). However, the ClpB/DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE system increased the luciferase reactivation yield up to ∼3,000-fold (Table I). The present studies extend the pioneer work of Lindquist and co-workers (1Schirmer E.C. Glover J.R. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 289-296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 7Parsell D.A. Kowal A.S. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Nature. 1994; 372: 475-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar, 8Glover J.R. Lindquist S. Cell. 1998; 94: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar) on the function of Hsp104 in yeast into prokaryotic stress-response systems and confirm that Hsp100 proteins may be the most potent aggregation suppressants known to date. Also, our studies show previously unrecognized capabilities of the well studied E. coli chaperones: DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE. It has been found before that, under the conditions of less severe aggregation of luciferase than those employed in this study, DnaJ binds denatured luciferase and targets it to DnaK, which prevents luciferase aggregation (16Schroder H. Langer T. Hartl F.U. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4137-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). GrpE participates in dissociating the luciferase-DnaK/DnaJ complex. We do not know, at present, which of these chaperones interact with ClpB and how the luciferase substrate is shuttled between ClpB and DnaJ/DnaK/GrpE. To understand the mechanism of refolding reactions described in this study, it will be essential to characterize interactions of ClpB with DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE and to identify the sequence of substrate binding and substrate remodeling steps taking place in this chaperone system. ClpB may not be the only Clp ATPase capable of cooperating with otherE. coli chaperones in suppressing protein aggregation. However, although ClpA protects luciferase from heat-inactivation, it does not affect the yield of luciferase reactivation by DnaK and DnaJ (6Wickner S. Gottesman S. Skowyra D. Hoskins J. McKenney K. Maurizi M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12218-12222Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Because ClpB has not been implicated in protein degradation processes in E. coli, overexpression of ClpB, possibly together with DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE, may be potentially useful in preventing protein aggregation and improving recovery of recombinant proteins.

Spectrophotometric measurements showed that DCF could be oxidized either by horseradish peroxidase-compound I or -compound II with the obligate generation of the DCF phenoxyl radical (DCF⋅). This one-electron oxidation was confirmed by ESR spin-trapping experiments. DCF⋅ oxidizes GSH, generating the glutathione thiyl radical (GS⋅), which was detected by the ESR spin-trapping technique. In this case, oxygen was consumed by a sequence of reactions initiated by the GS⋅ radical. Similarly, DCF⋅ oxidized NADH, generating the NAD⋅ radical that reduced oxygen to superoxide (O⨪2), which was also detected by the ESR spin-trapping technique. Superoxide dismutated to generate H2O2, which reacted with horseradish peroxidase, setting up an enzymatic chain reaction leading to H2O2 production and oxygen consumption. In contrast, when ascorbic acid reduced the DCF phenoxyl radical back to its parent molecule, it formed the unreactive ascorbate anion radical. Clearly, DCF catalytically stimulates the formation of reactive oxygen species in a manner that is dependent on and affected by various biochemical reducing agents.

The diacetate form of DCFH enters the cell and is hydrolyzed by intracellular esterases to liberate DCFH.

The fluorescence intensity can be measured and is the basis of the popular cellular assay for oxidative stress (1Tsuchiya M. Suematsu M. Suzuki H.

A recent paper by LeBel et al.(27LeBel C.P. Ischiropoulos H. Bondy S.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1992; 5: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (2190) Google Scholar) mentioned that the interpretation of specific reactive oxygen species involved in the oxidation of DCFH to DCF in biological systems should be approached with caution. It has also been demonstrated that the photoreduction of DCF results in the formation of the DCF semiquinone free radical (DCF⨪), which, under aerobic conditions, is oxidized by oxygen to its parent dye, DCF, concomitantly forming superoxide radical (28Marchesi E. Rota C. Fann Y.C. Chignell C.F. Mason R.P. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1999; 26: 148-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Moreover, it was reported that DCFH, upon reacting with horseradish peroxidase-compound I or -compound II, was oxidized to DCF⨪, which was subsequently air-oxidized to DCF with the concurrent generation of superoxide radical (29Rota C. Chignell C.F. Mason R.P. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1999; 27 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). In the present work, the reaction of DCF with horseradish peroxidase in the presence of reduced glutathione or NADH was studied to continue our investigation of the DCF fluorometric assay. We employed the ESR spin-trapping technique and measured the oxygen consumption to evaluate free radical formation during the reactions along with the formation of compound I and compound II monitored by UV-visible spectrophotometry. Our results indicate that when DCF reacts with compound I and compound II, DCF is oxidized to the phenoxyl free radical DCF⋅, reducing the respective horseradish peroxidase enzyme intermediates (Scheme FS1). In the presence of a reducing agent, such as GSH or NADH, DCF⋅is then reduced back to DCF with the formation of GS⋅ or NAD⋅, respectively, and the subsequent generation of superoxide. Horseradish peroxidase type VI-A (EC 1.11.1.7), porcine liver esterase (EC 3.1.1.1), diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid, DCF, and the spin trap 2-methyl-2-nitrosopropane (MNP) were purchased from Sigma. Tris and Chelex 100 resin were purchased from Bio-Rad. Catalase (from beef liver, 65,000 units/mg) (EC 1.11.1.6) and superoxide dismutase (from bovine erythrocytes, 5,000 units/mg) (EC1.15.1.1) were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Hydrogen peroxide (30%) was purchased from Fisher. All of the reactions were carried out in a 50 mm Tris buffer adjusted to pH 7.4 with hydrochloric acid. The Tris-HCl buffer was treated with Chelex 100 resin to remove traces of transition metal ions and contained 50 μm diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid to minimize the possibility of trace metal catalysis. DCF was dissolved with methanol to form a 12.5 mm solution, which was then diluted to 500 μm with a pH 7.4 Tris-HCl buffer (i.e. methanol-buffer solution). In the experiments shown in Fig. 2, a 25 mm DCF methanol solution was directly added to the samples. MNP was prepared in methanol and kept in the dark during the experiments. The spin trap 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrrolineN-oxide (DMPO) was purchased from Sigma, purified by vacuum sublimation at ambient temperature, and stored at −70 °C until use. 2′,7′-Dichlorofluorescin diacetate (also known as 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, DCFH-DA) was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). DCFH-DA was enzymatically deesterified; i.e. 500 μm DCFH-DA in a methanol-buffer solution reacted with esterase (100 units) in the dark at room temperature for 1 h at neutral pH. Concentrations of horseradish peroxidase were determined by using the extinction coefficient ε = 102 mm−1cm−1 at 403 nm (30Dunford H.B. Stillman J.S. Coord. Chem. Rev. 1976; 19: 187-251Crossref Scopus (930) Google Scholar). Stock concentrations of H2O2 in deionized water were determined by using the extinction coefficient ε = 43.6m−1 cm−1 at 240 nm (31Hildebrandt A.G. Roots I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1975; 171: 385-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). DCF and DCFH were stored and kept from room light. Sample preparation and experiments were performed in the dark. All reactions were initiated with the addition of horseradish peroxidase. In the samples where DCFH or DCF was omitted, an equivalent volume of methanol-buffer solution was added. ESR spectra were recorded on a Bruker ECS-106 ESR spectrometer (Billerica, MA) operating at 9.77 GHz with a modulation frequency of 50 kHz equipped with a TM110 cavity. All experiments were performed at room temperature with a 17-mm quartz flat cell. In the experiments described in Figs. 2, 3, and 8, samples were aspirated into the flat cell with ESR data acquisition started approximately 15 s after sample preparations. The data analysis and spectral simulation were performed using programs developed in our laboratory and are available through the Internet. The details of the program are described elsewhere (32Duling D.R. J. Magn. Reson. B. 1994; 104: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). The low energy structure of MNP-DCF radical adduct was obtained using the MOPAC with MM2 minimization.Figure 8ESR spectrum of ascorbate anion radical obtained from a reaction mixture containing DCF , ascorbate, horseradish peroxidase, and H2O2.

The hyperfine coupling constant of the radical species is provided under “Results.” Spectrometer conditions were as follows: modulation amplitude, 1 G; microwave power, 20 milliwatts; time constant, 0.164 s; conversion time, 0.164 s; scan time, 168 s; receiver gain, 4 × 105. The center field was offset to a higher field so the ascorbate ESR spectrum would be scanned earlier in the spectral sweep.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) All optical measurements were carried out with an SLM Aminco DW-2000 UV-visible dual beam spectrophotometer (Urbana, IL). The samples were prepared and recorded in deionized water (used in place of Tris buffer to prevent any reductant in the solution). Oxygen consumption measurements were made using a Clark-type oxygen electrode fitted to a 1.8-ml Gilson sample cell and monitored by a YSI Inc. model 53 oxygen monitor. Oxygen consumption data were recorded by a computer interfaced with a DT2801 Data Translation board connected to the oxygen monitor. All of the experiments were performed at room temperature, and the incubation conditions are described in the figure legends. The UV-visible spectra of the resting state of compound I and compound II reacting with DCF are shown in Fig.1. The UV-visible spectrum of the resting state of horseradish peroxidase (1 μm) is characterized by its maximum absorption at 403 nm (Fig. 1, scan 0). The addition of DCF to horseradish peroxidase solution resulted in a small increase in the absorption at 403 nm due to the fact that DCF has absorption at this frequency (maximum at 502 nm) as shown in Fig. 1, scan 1. The significant decrease in intensity at 502 nm when H2O2 was added to the system demonstrated that DCF had been transformed during the reaction of DCF with horseradish peroxidase in the presence of H2O2 (Fig. 1, scan 2). In this case, compound I formed by the addition of H2O2 to horseradish peroxidase rapidly reacted with DCF to form the DCF⋅ radical and compound II, which is characterized by the appearance of an isosbestic point for horseradish peroxidase and its compound II at 412 nm (33Claiborne A. Fridovich I. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2329-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Scan 3 in Fig. 1 shows the conversion of compound II back to the horseradish peroxidase resting state. These results are consistent with the peroxidase-mediated metabolism of DCF to the corresponding DCF⋅ radical as shown in SchemeFS1. The ESR spin-trapping technique was employed to characterize the free radical formed during the turnover of horseradish peroxidase with H2O2 and DCF in the presence or absence of a reducing agent. When DCF was reacted with horseradish peroxidase and H2O2 in the presence of spin trap MNP, an isotropic three-line spectrum with a hyperfine coupling constant of 14.9 G was detected (Fig. 2 A). The absence of any hydrogen or chlorine hyperfine couplings in the three-line spectrum excluded these atoms at positions α or β to the nitroxide nitrogen and indicated that the radical was located on a tertiary carbon (34Gunther M.R. Tschirret-Guth R.A. Witkowska H.E. Fann Y.C. Barr D.P. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Mason R.P. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1293-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 35Pichot C. Spitz R. Guyot A. J. Macromol. Sci. Chem. 1977; A11: 251-265Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The structure of the radical adduct based on our ESR data and energy minimization is shown in Fig. 2. The radical formation was completely dependent on the presence of DCF (Fig.2 B). The absence of either horseradish peroxidase or H2O2 resulted in a very weak signal (Fig. 2,C and D) consisting, for the most part, of the di-tert-butylnitroxide from the decomposition of MNP characterized by a hyperfine coupling constant of 17 G (36Makino K. Suzuki N. Moriya F. Rokushika S. Hatano H. Radiat. Res. 1981; 86: 294-310Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This weak signal is also present in the solution of MNP in buffer (Fig.2 E). Based on the characteristics of its ESR signal and the similarity of the hyperfine coupling constant compared with that previously obtained from the trapping of MNP/tyrosyl radical (37Barr D.P. Gunther M.R. Deterding L.J. Tomer K.B. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15498-15503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), we assigned the radical as the phenoxyl free radical of DCF. When DCF was incubated with a solution of GSH, H2O2, and horseradish peroxidase in the presence of the spin trap DMPO, a four-line ESR spectrum of the DMPO/GS⋅ adduct was detected (Fig.3 A), characterized by hyperfine coupling constants of a N = 15.15 G and aβH = 16.17 G, consistent with those previously reported (38Gadelha F.R. Hanna P.M. Mason R.P. Docampo R. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1992; 85: 35-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 39Mottley C. Toy K. Mason R.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1987; 31: 417-421PubMed Google Scholar). The same radical adduct was obtained from a system where DCF was omitted, but the ESR spectrum was of lower intensity (Fig. 3 B). The radical adduct depended on the presence of GSH or horseradish peroxidase (Fig. 3, C andD). The addition of superoxide dismutase did not have any effect (data not shown), eliminating the possibility of superoxide-dependent glutathione thiyl radical formation. However, the addition of catalase completely eliminated the ESR signal (Fig. 3 E), indicating the radical adduct formation is H2O2-dependent. When H2O2 was omitted, a weak spectrum of the DMPO/GS⋅ adduct was detected (Fig. 3 F) and was completely suppressed by the addition of catalase, indicating the formation of H2O2 via oxidation of GSH by trace metal catalysis. Moreover, molecular oxygen was consumed in a reaction mixture containing DCF, H2O2, and GSH (Fig.4 a). The duration of the fast rate of oxygen consumption strongly depended on the concentration of hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 4 a, A and C). When DCF was reacted with GSH, horseradish peroxidase, and H2O2, the rate of oxygen consumption was very high for ∼1 min, and then it decreased (Fig. 4 a,A). This is due to the consumption of H2O2 in this first minute, as is demonstrated by the fact that the addition of more H2O2restored the initial rate of oxygen consumption (Fig. 4 a,B) until all of the oxygen in the solution was consumed. When DCF, GSH, or horseradish peroxidase was omitted, no oxygen consumption was observed (Fig. 4 b, E–G). However, when ascorbic acid (1 mm) was added to the reaction mixture prior to or after the horseradish peroxidase initiation, the oxygen consumption was completely inhibited (Fig.4 b, H and B, respectively). The same inhibition was obtained even when 100 μm of ascorbate was used (data not shown). In addition, the oxygen consumption was inhibited when DMPO (200 mm) was added prior to or after the horseradish peroxidase initiation (Fig. 4 b, Dand C, respectively). When superoxide dismutase (100 μg/ml) was added to the reaction mixture before horseradish peroxidase initiation (Fig. 4 c, A), the initial rate of oxygen consumption was found to be identical to that of the complete system (Fig. 4 c, B). However, in the presence of superoxide dismutase (Fig. 4 c, A), the oxygen consumption did not slow after 1 min, in contrast to that of the complete system, but completely stopped approximately 2 min after the horseradish peroxidase initiation (Fig. 4 c,A). Apparently, superoxide dismutase, catalyzing the disproportionation of superoxide radicals, facilitated H2O2 formation, keeping the consumption rate high for a longer time. The addition of superoxide dismutase 90 s after horseradish peroxidase initiation did completely inhibit the oxygen consumption (Fig. 4 c, C). In this case, superoxide dismutase had been added when the H2O2 was already consumed, and this slower oxygen consumption came almost completely from a free radical chain reaction that is completely superoxide-dependent. The addition of catalase (150 μg/ml) prior to or after horseradish peroxidase initiation completely inhibited the oxygen consumption (Fig.4 c, D and E). When added hydrogen peroxide was omitted from the complete system, the rate of oxygen consumption was much slower (Fig.5 A). The addition of more diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (from 250 to 800 μmin final concentration) slowed the rate of oxygen consumption further without stopping it completely (data not shown), demonstrating the involvement of metal catalysis. Moreover, the addition of superoxide dismutase (100 μg/ml) to the reaction mixture right before horseradish peroxidase completely inhibited the oxygen consumption (Fig. 5 D). A similar inhibition was obtained when superoxide dismutase was added 2 min after the addition of horseradish peroxidase (Fig. 5 B). These results show that, in the absence of H2O2, oxygen consumption arose completely from a superoxide-dependent reaction. When catalase was added to the reaction mixture before or after horseradish peroxidase initiation, the oxygen consumption was completely inhibited (Fig. 5, Cand E), indicating that the presence of a small amount of hydrogen peroxide in the system was also necessary for oxygen consumption. When DCF was incubated with NADH and horseradish peroxidase in the presence of the spin trap DMPO, a composite ESR spectrum was detected (Fig. 6 A). A similar ESR spectrum, with much lower intensity, was observed in the same system without DCF (Fig. 6 B). When NADH (Fig. 6 D) or horseradish peroxidase (Fig. 6 E) was omitted from the system, no signal or only a very weak signal was detected. The addition of superoxide dismutase completely inhibited the radical formation (Fig. 6 F), confirming the involvement of superoxide radicals in the formation of the DMPO radical adducts. The addition of catalase had the same inhibitory effect as superoxide dismutase (Fig.6 G), demonstrating that the presence of H2O2, at least in traces, was necessary for the radical reaction to proceed. The hydrogen peroxide, essential for the initial activation of horseradish peroxidase, presumably resulted from autoxidation of NADH. In order to characterize the radical formed during the spin-trapping study of DCF oxidation by horseradish peroxidase in the presence of NADH, the ESR spectrum of the system without DCF (Fig. 6 B) was subtracted from that of the complete system (Fig. 6 A) to yield a single radical species (Fig. 6 C). Based on the analysis of hyperfine coupling constants and characteristics of the radical, it was assigned as the DMPO-superoxide radical adduct, DMPO/⋅OOH, with hyperfine coupling constants ofa N = 14.16 G, aβH = 11.25 G, and aγH = 1.2 G, consistent with those previously reported (40Buettner G.R. Mason R.P. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Furthermore, oxygen consumption was investigated in the same reaction mixture containing DCF, NADH, and horseradish peroxidase with the addition of catalase, SOD, or ascorbate. The results are shown in Fig.7 a. Molecular oxygen in the reaction mixture was completely consumed in less than 8 min (Fig.7 a, A). When DCF, NADH, or horseradish peroxidase was omitted from the system, no oxygen consumption was observed (Figs.7 a, E, G, and H, respectively). When ascorbic acid (1 mm) was added prior to or after horseradish peroxidase initiation, the oxygen consumption was completely inhibited (Figs. 7 a, F andD, respectively). In addition, the same inhibition was observed when 100 μm ascorbate was added before horseradish peroxidase or 250 μm ascorbate was added after horseradish peroxidase (data not shown). When the spin trap DMPO was added after or prior to horseradish peroxidase initiation, the oxygen consumption was inhibited (Figs. 7 a, B andC, respectively). These results are consistent with radical formation during the oxidation of DCF by horseradish peroxidase in the presence of NADH as demonstrated by ESR. The addition of catalase to the complete system also strongly inhibited oxygen consumption (Fig.7 b, D and E). When superoxide dismutase was added to the reaction mixture prior to horseradish peroxidase initiation, the rate of oxygen consumption was found to be slightly faster than that of the complete system and was completely inhibited after 6 min (Fig. 7 b, B). The addition of superoxide dismutase 1 min after the addition of horseradish peroxidase possibly had a weak inhibitory effect (Fig. 7 b,C). Ascorbate is known to undergo one-electron oxidation to produce the relatively stable ascorbate free radical that can be detected by direct ESR. A reaction mixture of DCF, H2O2, and horseradish peroxidase in the presence of ascorbate gave a typical doublet ESR signal of the ascorbate anion free radical as shown in Fig.8 A with the characteristic hyperfine coupling constant of a H = 1.79 G (41Laroff G.P. Fessenden R.W. Schuler R.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1972; 94: 9062-9073Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). No changes in the ascorbate anion radical spectrum were observed upon the addition of GSH (same concentration as ascorbate) to the reaction mixture (data not shown), indicating that DCF⋅ phenoxyl radical reacted with ascorbate instead of GSH (42Sturgeon B.E. Sipe Jr., H.J. Barr D.P. Corbett J.T. Martinez J.G. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30116-30121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In this case, ascorbate was a better radical scavenger than GSH. The omission of DCF, H2O2, or horseradish peroxidase resulted in a weaker signal (Fig. 8, B–D). The addition of catalase (50 μg/ml) to the reaction mixture inhibited the formation of ascorbate anion radical (Fig. 8 F) to the level found with ascorbate alone (Fig. 8 G). The presence of superoxide dismutase (50 μg/ml) in the reaction mixture had no effect on the ESR signal (Fig.8 E), suggesting that superoxide radicals were not involved in either ascorbate radical formation or decay. In order to better understand the chemistry involved between DCFH and DCF, we measured oxygen consumption from a reaction mixture containing the reduced leuco compound DCFH and horseradish peroxidase. When DCFH reacted with horseradish peroxidase in the presence of NADH under room light, oxygen was consumed within 12 min (Fig.9 A). Fig. 9 B shows that for approximately 12 min, the rate of oxygen consumption in the dark was similar to that of the complete system without DCFH (Fig.9 C). Then the consumption rate increased dramatically and consumed all of the oxygen within the next 5 min. This 12-min lag phase probably represents the time required to oxidize DCFH to produce enough DCF (29Rota C. Chignell C.F. Mason R.P. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1999; 27 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) to support the oxygen-consuming reactions between DCF, horseradish peroxidase, and NADH (Fig. 7, a andb). When NADH was omitted from the system in the dark, no oxygen was consumed (Fig. 9 E). When the experiment was repeated under room light, no lag phase was detected, and the rate of oxygen consumption of the complete system was much faster (Fig.9 A). This result demonstrates that the oxidation of DCFH to DCF is also catalyzed by room light. When NADH was omitted from the reaction performed under room light, no detectable oxygen consumption was observed (Fig. 9 D). Our previous studies demonstrated the formation of DCF semiquinone (DCF⨪) free radical by photoreduction of DCF (28Marchesi E. Rota C. Fann Y.C. Chignell C.F. Mason R.P. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1999; 26: 148-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) or by horseradish peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of the reduced leuco compound DCFH (29Rota C. Chignell C.F. Mason R.P. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1999; 27 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The photoreduction of DCF to DCF⨪ in the presence of NADH or GSH under aerobic conditions resulted in the formation of superoxide radical that was detected by the ESR spin-trapping technique (28Marchesi E. Rota C. Fann Y.C. Chignell C.F. Mason R.P. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1999; 26: 148-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The enzymatic oxidation of DCFH in the dark to DCF⨪ by the reaction of horseradish peroxidase in the presence or absence of added H2O2 resulted in hydroxyl and superoxide radical formation, and H2O2 was demonstrated to be formed during the deacetylation of DCFH-DA (29Rota C. Chignell C.F. Mason R.P. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1999; 27 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). In the present study, we analyzed the oxidation of the fluorescent dye DCF by horseradish peroxidase in the dark. Our results provide strong evidence for the formation of the novel phenoxyl radical intermediate during the peroxidase-mediated oxidation of DCF as demonstrated by the ESR spin-trapping technique (Fig. 2). UV-visible spectrophotometry confirmed the existence of compound II during the oxidation, and significant changes in the DCF absorption band at 502 nm were observed (Fig. 1), providing evidence for one-electron peroxide-mediated oxidation of DCF (Scheme FS1); i.e. when DCF reacts with horseradish peroxidase in the presence of H2O2, DCF undergoes one-electron oxidation, with the obligate formation of the DCF phenoxyl radical (Fig. 2). This free radical is structurally and chemically distinct from the DCF semiquinone DCF⨪. In the presence of reducing agents such as NADH and GSH, the DCF phenoxyl radical is reduced back to its parent compound DCF with the concomitant formation of NAD⋅ or GS⋅, respectively, which, in the presence of oxygen, form superoxide radical. DCF, as shown in Scheme FS2, catalytically stimulates the formation of GS⋅ and oxygen consumption in the glutathione-H2O2-horseradish peroxidase system (Figs. 3 and 4 b). The rate of oxygen consumption was detectable in the absence of added H2O2 (Fig.5 A). In this case, oxygen consumption can occur when GS⋅ reacts with another GSH (GS−) molecule to form the (GSSG)⨪, which reacts rapidly with oxygen to produce superoxide radical (43Mason R.P. Spatz L. Bloom A.D. Biological Consequences of Oxidative Stress: Implications for Cardiovascular Disease and Carcinogenesis. Oxford University Press, New York1992: 23-49Google Scholar). When the system contained only traces of H2O2, superoxide dismutase almost completely inhibited the rate of oxygen consumption, suggesting that, at least in part, superoxide radical is produced by a free radical chain reaction (Figs. 4 c, C, and 5, B andD). No superoxide was detected by ESR in this system, probably because the precursor of this radical, GS⋅, is very efficiently scavenged by DMPO (k = 2.6 × 108m−1 s−1) (44Davies M.J. Forni L.G. Shuter S.L. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1987; 61: 177-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), as demonstrated also by the total inhibition of oxygen consumption by the addition of DMPO (Fig. 4b, C and D). At pH 7.8, superoxide radical can react with GSH with a second-order rate constant of k = 6.7 × 105m−1 s−1, producing H2O2 and regenerating GS⋅, thus continuing the chain reaction (38Gadelha F.R. Hanna P.M. Mason R.P. Docampo R. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1992; 85: 35-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). DCF greatly enhanced the rate of oxygen consumption by horseradish peroxidase and NADH (Fig. 7 a). The resulting superoxide radical was detected by ESR spin trapping (Fig. 6). The inhibition of free radical formation and oxygen consumption by the addition of catalase demonstrated that a trace of hydrogen peroxide was present in the system (Figs. 6 G and 7 b, D andE). The reactions leading to the formation of superoxide radical by the reaction of DCF and horseradish peroxidase/H2O2 in the presence of the reducing agents NADH and GSH are summarized in Scheme FS2. Similar to GSH, superoxide radical can oxidize additional NADH with a second-order rate constant of k = 9.3 × 104m−1 s1 at pH 7.4, producing H2O2 and regenerating NAD⋅, thus continuing the chain reaction (45Fujimori K. Nakajima H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 846-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The complete suppression of oxygen consumption by the addition of ascorbate to both the DCF-GSH-horseradish peroxidase (Fig.4 b) and the DCF-NADH-horseradish peroxidase systems (Fig.7 a) and the DCF-dependent increase of ascorbate anion radical formation (Fig. 8) also support the DCF phenoxyl radical formation. Ascorbate radical is relatively stable once formed and does not further oxidize any other biochemical reductant in the system nor reduce oxygen. The reaction of the reduced leuco compound DCFH with horseradish peroxidase in the presence of NADH consumed oxygen in a light-dependent manner because DCFH was more efficiently oxidized to DCF in the presence of light (Fig. 9). This experiment demonstrates that there are many reactions involving DCFH, DCF, and/or light in biological systems that can potentially lead to artificial radical formation. Several issues concerning the measurement of DCF formation as an index of intracellular hydrogen peroxide (or other reactive species) formation must be considered in future work. First, the same species that forms DCF from DCFH (in this case horseradish peroxidase compounds I and II) will probably oxidize DCF to the novel DCF phenoxyl radical DCF⋅. Second, DCF⋅ oxidizes many biochemical reducing agents to free radicals, which may or may not (depending on their chemistry) react with molecular oxygen to form superoxide and, ultimately, hydrogen peroxide. Consequently, the potential for DCF⋅ oxidation forming reactive oxygen species will strongly depend on the intracellular concentration of the various biochemical reducing agents. This study, combined with our earlier studies (28Marchesi E. Rota C. Fann Y.C. Chignell C.F. Mason R.P. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1999; 26: 148-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 29Rota C. Chignell C.F. Mason R.P. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1999; 27 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), clearly shows that results from the DCF fluorometric assay are difficult to interpret in cells undergoing oxidative stress."

Takahashi M. Matsui M. Ishii S. Date T. Sasamoto S. Ishizaki R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 11075-11089Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). These three members display notable homology toward each other in three regions: the N-terminal DNA-binding domain and two regions in the C-terminal region (3Nomura N. Takahashi M. Matsui M. Ishii S.

The DNA-binding domain in the N-terminal region of the myb protein (Myb) consists of three imperfect tandem repeats of 51–52 amino acids, each of which contains a helix-turn-helix variation motif (4Sakura H.

The second and third repeats are closely packed into the major groove of DNA, and the two recognition helices in these repeats bind to the specific base sequence, AACNG, cooperatively (8Ogata K.

Nature. 1988; 335: 835-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar).In addition to the N-terminal DNA-binding domain, c-Myb has two functional domains responsible for transcriptional activation and negative regulation, respectively (4Sakura H.

The transcriptional activation domain of c-Myb, which is rich in acidic amino acids, is adjacent to the DNA-binding domain. Deletion of the negative regulatory domain (NRD), located in the carboxyl-proximal portion of the molecule, increases both transactivation and transformation capacities, implying that this domain normally represses c-Myb activity (4Sakura H.

A-Myb has a very similar functional domain structure to c-Myb and is the strongest transcriptional activator among the three members of themyb gene family (12Foos G. Grimm S. Klempnauer K.-H.

Although B-Myb has an acidic transcriptional activation domain located downstream of the DNA-binding domain, the C-terminal portion appears to be the region required for transcriptional activation (19Tashiro S.

The level of c-myb expression is predominantly, although not exclusively, high in immature hematopoietic cells, and its expression is turned off during terminal differentiation (25Westin E.H. Gallo G.C. Arya S.K. Eva A. Souza L.M. Baluda M.A. Aaronson S.A. Wong-Staal F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2194-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 26Gonda T.J. Metcaf D.

Constitutive expression of a transfected c-myb gene blocks the induced differentiation of immature erythroid cells (28Todokoro K. Watson R.J. Higo H. Amanuma H. Kuramochi S. Yanagisawa H. Ikawa Y.

Science. 1988; 242: 1303-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Furthermore, homozygous c-myb mutant mice are severely anemic and die in utero because of defective fetal hematopoiesis (30Mucenski M.L. McLain K. Kier A.B. Swerdlow S.H. Schereiner C.M. Miller T.A.

In addition to the important role of c-myb in hematopoietic progenitor cells, c-myb is also critical for the mitogen-induced proliferation of certain types of cells such as T lymphocytes (31Stern J.B.

Unlike c-myb, A-myb is highly expressed in the developing central nervous system, male germ cells, female breast ductal epithelium, and B lymphocytes (34Trauth K. Mutschler B. Jenkins N.A.

Consistent with its expression in adult testis and female breast, A-myb-deficient males are infertile because of a block in spermatogenesis, and null A-myb females show underdevelopment of breast tissue following pregnancy (35Toscani A.

Klempnauer K.-H. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1889-1894PubMed Google Scholar). Like that of c-myb, the expression of B-myb correlates with cellular proliferation. B-myb mRNA is not expressed in resting cells but is induced late in G1 phase, and the resulting high levels are maintained through S phase (37Golay J. Capucci A. Arsura M. Castellano M. Rizzo V. Introna M. Blood. 1991; 77: 149-158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Reiss K. Travali S. Calabretta B. Baserga R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 148: 338-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). B-myb mRNA levels decrease when HL-60 or U937 cells are induced to differentiate (38Reiss K. Travali S. Calabretta B. Baserga R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 148: 338-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 39Arsura M. Introna M. Passerini F. Mantovani A. Golay J. Blood. 1992; 79: 2708-2716Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of B-mybexpression by the introduction of a B-myb antisense construct diminished the cell proliferation of hematopoietic cells and fibroblasts, but constitutive expression of B-myb induced a transformed phenotype (39Arsura M. Introna M. Passerini F. Mantovani A. Golay J. Blood. 1992; 79: 2708-2716Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Sala A. Calabretta B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10415-10419Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, there has been no indication of a role for B-myb in development.To understand the physiological role of B-myb, we have generated B-myb-deficient mice. Analysis of B-myb-deficient embryos indicates that B-myb is essential for inner cell mass (ICM) 1The abbreviations used are:ICMinner cell massbpbase pair(s)PCRpolymerase chain reaction 1The abbreviations used are:ICMinner cell massbpbase pair(s)PCRpolymerase chain reaction formation in an early stage of development.RESULTSThe B-myb mutant mice were generated by homologous recombination in TT-2 ES cells. Exon 5 encoding amino acids 94–167 of B-Myb, which corresponds to a part of repeats 2 and 3 required for binding to the Myb-recognition sequence, was replaced with aneo cassette in the gene-targeting vector (Fig.1 A). Therefore, removal of this exon should lead to a complete loss of DNA-binding activity of B-Myb. Homologous recombinants were characterized by the appearance of a 7.0-kb EcoRI fragment with the 3′-probe and a 236-bp PCR-amplified fragment with the B-myb forward primer andneo primer (Fig. 1, B and C). Chimeras were normally obtained from two independent mutant ES clones and mated with C57BL/6 females to generate F1 heterozygous mutant mice. Heterozygous (B-myb +/−) mice were identified by Southern blot and PCR analysis (Fig. 1 B). Western blot analysis showed that the expression level of the 92-kDa B-Myb protein in spleen was similar between the wild-type and the B-myb +/− mice (Fig. 1 C). This was confirmed by using the three different anti-B-Myb antibodies (data not shown). This suggests that a compensatory mechanism plays a role in maintaining the level of B-Myb protein. Similar observations were reported so far in other genes (47Minamisawa S. Gu Y. Ross Jr., J. Chien K.R. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10066-10070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The B-Myb protein fragment lacking the DNA-binding domain encoded by the mutated allele, which can act as a dominant negative form, was not detected in the B-myb +/− mice (Fig. 1 C). Heterozygous males and females were phenotypically normal and fertile.Heterozygous mice were intercrossed, and the genotypes of resulting 3-weeks-old offspring were determined. Among 212 offspring derived from two independent germ-line chimeras, no B-myb −/− homozygotes were detected, and the ratio of B-myb +/+ to B-myb +/− genotypes was 1:2 (data not shown). The fact that the ratio of B-myb +/+ and B-myb +/− genotype in the progeny population of the cross of B-myb +/− and B-myb +/+ (either male or female) was 1:1 indicated that B-myb − germ cells were not eliminated during spermatogenesis or oogenesis. Because 98 of the progeny were from intercrosses between two independent ES cell line-derived heterozygotes, the lack of B-myb-null progeny could not have been because of homozygosity of an undetected linked mutation inadvertently generated in either of the targeted ES cell lines. We conclude that homozygosity for the B-myb null allele is lethal during embryonic development. B-myb is expressed at similar levels during all stages of embryogenesis (36Sitzman J. Noben-Trauth K. Kamano H. Klempnauer K.-H. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1889-1894PubMed Google Scholar). As many of these expression sites may be required for development to birth, we examined embryos of heterozygotes intercrosses on different days of gestation (Table I). Among 32 phenotypically normal embryo day 3.5 (3.5 days post-coitus) blastocyst, 6 (19%) were homozygous for the mutant allele, indicating that B-myb is not essential for embryogenesis before uterine implantation. At embryo day 6.5–7.5, all decidua were externally indistinguishable, but dissection revealed that 8 of 51 (16%) implantation sites lacked discernible embryos, yolk sacs, and ectoplacental cones. Of 65 phenotypically normal embryo day 6.5–7.5 embryos subjected to genotyping, none were homozygous mutants. Consistent with this, none of the phenotypically normal embryo day 8.5–10.5 embryos were homozygous mutants, whereas an additional nine implantation sites (12% of the total) were undergoing resorption. The high frequency of abortive postimplantation development and lack of older B-myb null embryos indicate that B-myb null embryos degenerate shortly after uterine implantation.Table IGenotypes of litters from heterozygous intercrossEmbryo day+/++/−−/−Resorption8.5–10.52144096.5–7.51627083.5 (blastocyst)9176The number of the wild type (+/+), heterozygous (+/−), and homozygous (−/−) embryos is indicated. The genotypes of resorbed embryos could not be determined. Open table in a new tab Because B-myb is expressed in both the preimplantation embryos and maternal deciduum (36Sitzman J. Noben-Trauth K. Kamano H. Klempnauer K.-H. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1889-1894PubMed Google Scholar), the abortive development of B-myb mutant embryos could result from defects intrinsic to the embryo or from a breakdown in the signaling between the embryo and the uterus. To distinguish these two possibilities, embryo day 3.5-blastocysts isolated from heterozygotes intercrosses were grownin vitro, examined for growth abnormalities, and subsequently genotyped. By optimizing growth conditions, blastocysts grown in vitro develop to the egg cylinder stage and can even be taken to the 8-somite stage (45Gonda M.A. Hsu Y.-C. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1980; 56: 23-39PubMed Google Scholar, 46Wu T.-C. Wan Y.-J. Damjanov I. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1981; 65: 105-117PubMed Google Scholar). The series of developmental changes that occur during this process have been clearly delineated. Forty-three blastocysts were individually cultured for 5 days and then photographed and lysed for genotyping. Mutant homozygotes, heterozygotes, and wild-type embryos were indistinguishable as embryo day 3.5-blastocysts, attached blastocysts, or lipid vesicle-containing attached blastocysts (Fig.2, A–C), indicating that the B-myb mutation does not affect development prior to implantation. After 5 days in culture, all the cultured blastocysts of each genotype (B-myb +/+, B-myb +/−, and B-myb −/−) gave rise to an adherent sheet of trophectoderm-like cells, including trophoblastic giant cells (Fig. 2,D–F). However, B-myb −/−blastocysts showed severely impaired proliferation of the ICM. As summarized in Fig. 2 G, the null genotype was never associated with robust outgrowths of the ICM (as in Fig. 2,D and E) and was the only genotype associated with undetectable ICM outgrowth (as in Fig. 2 F). The developmental defects of B-myb null embryos in vivo and in vitro demonstrate that B-myb is essential for growth of the ICM in the postimplantation phase of development.Figure 2In vitro outgrowth cultures of intercross embryos. Blastocysts were flushed out of the uterus of a B-myb +/− female 3.5 days after mating with a B-myb +/− male and were grown in vitro. Embryo day 3.5 wild-type (A), heterozygous (B), and homozygous (C) blastocysts appear normal. Outgrowth of polyploid trophectoderm (TE) cells was observed in all the cultures of wild-type (D), heterozygous (E), and homozygous (F) blastocysts. A well developed ICM is evident in the wild-type and heterozygous cultures and is composed of an outer primitive endoderm layer and an inner core ectoderm cells. No distinct ICM is seen in the homozygous culture.G, histogram summary of blastocyst outgrowth.

These results suggest that B-myb is essential for the proliferation of ES cells. We examined the expression of the three members of myb gene family in ES cells by Northern blotting. The 2.6-kb B-mybmRNA was highly expressed in ES cells, whereas neither the c-myb nor A-myb mRNAs was detected (Fig. 3). Thus, only B-mybamong the three members of myb gene family is expressed in ES cells, which is consistent with the speculation that B-myb is required for ES cell propagation.Figure 3Selective expression of B-myb in ES cells. Northern blot analysis was performed using 10 or 20 μg of total RNA. The cDNA fragment of either of the three members of myb gene family (A-, B-, and c-myb) was used as a probe. Photographs of the ethidium bromide-stained gels are indicated below. The upper band (arrow) detected with the B-myb probe is because of cross-hybridization with 28 S rRNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONIn this study, we generated a null mutation of the B-myb gene by homologous recombination in mouse ES cells. The B-myb mutation drastically affected embryonic growth, resulting in lethality before day 6.5 of gestation.One possible explanation for the early lethality of the B-myb −/− embryo is impaired G1/S transition in cell cycle. B-myb has been reported to have an important role as one of the target genes of E2F during G1/S transition (48Lam E.W.-F. Watson R.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2705-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The trophectoderm appeared more resistant to B-myb depletion than ICM cells as shown by thein vitro outgrowth experiments. Because of their rapid proliferation, ICM cells are much more sensitive to metabolic inhibitors than trophoblast cells. Exposure of blastocysts in vitro to x-ray or ultraviolet irradiation interferes with the proliferation of the ICM cells but has little effect on the trophoblast outgrowth (49Rowinski J. Solter D. Koprowski H. J. Exp. Zool. 1975; 192: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These irradiations also abrogate the G1/S transition in the cell cycle. The sensitivity of ICM to these irradiations appears to be consistent with the effect of B-myb depletion on ICM proliferation.B-myb is highly expressed in proliferating mouse ES cells and in proliferating cells in various regions of the embryo (36Sitzman J. Noben-Trauth K. Kamano H. Klempnauer K.-H. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1889-1894PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that B-Myb might be acting in these cells as a positive regulator of cell growth. In addition, we were unsuccessful in our attempts to obtain viable ES cells homozygous for the B-mybmutation, supporting the role of B-Myb in cell growth identifiedin vivo and in vitro. Thus, the B-mybgene may play, at some developmental stages and in specific tissues, a positive role in control of cell growth. If B-myb plays a role in the control of cellular proliferation, its inactivation should cause lethality at very early developmental stages. Nevertheless, embryo day 3.5 B-myb −/− blastocysts appeared normal, although their proliferative abilities in vitro were dramatically reduced. The in vivo survival of B-myb -/mutant embryos until embryo day 3.5 could be because of persistence of sufficient maternal B-mybprotein or mRNA for development of the embryo until the early gastrulation stages.The distinct phenotype of each member of the myb gene family, as deduced from the specific defects of A-, B-, and c-myb mutant mice in spermatogenesis, ICM formation, and hematopoiesis, respectively, appears to be related to their expression patterns. In some tissues, however, multiple members of the myb gene family are expressed. This raises the possibility that each member may have a distinct function and that each may regulate cell growth through a different mechanism. Rescuing the early lethality suffered by B-myb null embryos by generating the tissue-specific deficient mutant mice could provide insights into the other functions of B-myb. The c-myb proto-oncogene is the cellular progenitor of the v-myb oncogenes carried by the chicken retroviruses AMV and E26, which transform myelomonocytic hematopoietic cells (1Roussel M. Saule S. Lagrou C. Beug H. Graf T. Stehelin D. Nature. 1979; 281: 452-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 2Klempnauer K.-H. Gonda T., J. Bishop J.M. Cell. 1982; 31: 453-463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The mammalian myb gene family contains two other members, A-myb and B-myb, in addition to c-myb(3Nomura N. Takahashi M. Matsui M. Ishii S. Date T. Sasamoto S. Ishizaki R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 11075-11089Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). These three members display notable homology toward each other in three regions: the N-terminal DNA-binding domain and two regions in the C-terminal region (3Nomura N. Takahashi M. Matsui M. Ishii S. Date T. Sasamoto S. Ishizaki R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 11075-11089Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 4Sakura H. Kanei-Ishii C. Nagase T. Nakagoshi H. Gonda T.J. Ishii S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5758-5762Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The DNA-binding domain in the N-terminal region of the myb protein (Myb) consists of three imperfect tandem repeats of 51–52 amino acids, each of which contains a helix-turn-helix variation motif (4Sakura H. Kanei-Ishii C. Nagase T. Nakagoshi H. Gonda T.J. Ishii S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5758-5762Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 5Tanikawa J. Yasukawa T. Enari M. Ogata K.

Hirata Z.,. Sarai A. Ishii S. Nishimura Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 309-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The second and third repeats are closely packed into the major groove of DNA, and the two recognition helices in these repeats bind to the specific base sequence, AACNG, cooperatively (8Ogata K. Morikawa S. Nakamura H. Sekikawa A. Inoue T. Kanai H. Sarai A. Ishii S. Nishimura Y. Cell. 1994; 79: 639-648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 9Biedenkapp H. Borgmeyer U. Sippel A.E. Klempnauer K.-H. Nature. 1988; 335: 835-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). In addition to the N-terminal DNA-binding domain, c-Myb has two functional domains responsible for transcriptional activation and negative regulation, respectively (4Sakura H. Kanei-Ishii C. Nagase T. Nakagoshi H. Gonda T.J. Ishii S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5758-5762Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The transcriptional activation domain of c-Myb, which is rich in acidic amino acids, is adjacent to the DNA-binding domain. Deletion of the negative regulatory domain (NRD), located in the carboxyl-proximal portion of the molecule, increases both transactivation and transformation capacities, implying that this domain normally represses c-Myb activity (4Sakura H.

A-Myb has a very similar functional domain structure to c-Myb and is the strongest transcriptional activator among the three members of themyb gene family (12Foos G. Grimm S. Klempnauer K.-H.

Chem. 1997; 272: 21432-21443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Compared with c-Myb and A-Myb, B-Myb is a weaker transcriptional activator (16Mizuguchi G.

Although B-Myb has an acidic transcriptional activation domain located downstream of the DNA-binding domain, the C-terminal portion appears to be the region required for transcriptional activation (19Tashiro S. Takemoto Y. Handa H. Ishii S. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1699-1707PubMed Google Scholar, 20Oh I.H. Reddy E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). One possible regulatory mechanism mediated by the C-terminal portion is phosphorylation by cyclin A-dependent kinase. CyclinA/Cdk2 phosphorylates the C-terminal region of B-Myb and stimulates itstrans-activation capacity (21Sala A. Kundu M. Casella I. Engelhard A. Calabretta B. Grasso L. Paggi M.G. Giordano A.

We found that Cu2+, but not Fe3+, induces in the presence of NO a fastS-nitrosation of bovine serum albumin and human hemoglobin, and the reaction is prevented by thiol blocking reagents. During the reaction, Cu+ is accumulated and accounts for destabilization of the S-nitrosothiol formed. In contrast, glutathione rapidly dimerizes in the presence of Cu2+, the reaction competing with S-nitrosation and therefore preventing the formation of S-nitrosoglutathione. We have combined the presented role of Cu2+ inS-nitrosothiol formation with the known destabilizing effect of Cu+, providing a unique simple picture where the redox state of copper determines either the NO release fromS-nitrosothiols or the NO scavenging by thiol groups. The reactions described are fast, efficient, and may occur at micromolar concentration of all reactants.

At neutral pH, NO does not react directly with glutathione (GSH) to form S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), since only a slow redox reaction forming N2O and dimeric glutathione (GSSG) occurs (k′ = 4.8 × 10−4 s−1at 5 mm GSH; Ref. 19Hogg N. Singh R.S. Kalyanaraman B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Under aerobic conditions the auto-oxidation of NO generates N2O3(k ∼6 × 106m−2 s−1; Ref. 20Ford P.C. Wink D.A. Stanbury D.M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), which is able to S-nitrosate thiols. N2O3 reacts with both thiols and water, the two reactions proceeding atk = 0.1 - 1 × 105m−1 s−1 (21Kharitonov V.G. Sundquist A.R. Sharma V.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28158-28164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), for low molecular weight thiols, and k ∼ 30m−1 s−1 (21Kharitonov V.G. Sundquist A.R. Sharma V.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28158-28164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), respectively. It is worth noticing that the reaction with water efficiently competes with direct thiol nitrosation by N2O3, due to the large molar excess of water over thiols. NAD+ substituting oxygen for the electron acceptor can also accelerate the reaction of NO with thiols (22Gow A.J. Buerk D.G. Ischiropoulos H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2841-2845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Several authors also suggested thatS-nitrosation of thiols occurs by reaction with nitrosonium ions (NO+) formed either via metal-catalyzed oxidation of NO or via dinitrosyl-iron-cysteine complexes (8Stamler J.S. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Science. 1992; 258: 1898-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (2430) Google Scholar, 21Kharitonov V.G. Sundquist A.R. Sharma V.S. J. Biol.

In this study we have examined by spectroscopic and amperometric techniques the interaction of NO and thiols in the presence of cupric and ferric ions. Experiments have been carried out using the small tripeptide GSH (low millimolar amounts in the cell), bovine serum albumin (BSA, which is the most abundant plasma protein), and human hemoglobin (Hb). BSA and GSH both bear only one reduced cysteine per molecule (Cys-34 in BSA; Refs. 25Min He X. Carter D.C. Nature. 1992; 358: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (3408) Google Scholar and 26Kashiba-Iwatsuki M. Miyamoto M. Inoue M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 345: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), but, as shown below, they display in the presence of Cu2+ a very different reactivity with NO. Hb has been reported to undergoS-nitrosation, the reaction occurring at the level of Cys-β93 (27Jia L. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1996; 380: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1454) Google Scholar). We found that Cu2+, but not Fe3+, catalyzes the rapid S-nitrosation of BSA with a stoichiometry of ∼1 SNO/BSA, and of Hb with a stoichiometry dependent on the derivative used. GSH showed under similar conditions no reaction with NO, probably because of fast thiol dimerization. In contrast to other reports (8Stamler J.S. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Science. 1992; 258: 1898-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (2430) Google Scholar, 21Kharitonov V.G. Sundquist A.R. Sharma V.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 29244-29249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), our evidence does not indicate a role for NO+ in Cu2+-inducedS-nitrosation. As this Cu2+-mediated reaction is fast, selective for thiols, and efficient, it may be relevant for RS-NO formation in vitro. GSH was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals; HgCl2, Cu(II)SO4, and Cu(I)Cl from Merck; DTNB, EDTA, NEM, PMB, neocuproine, and BSA (catalog no. A-2153) from Sigma Aldrich. Hb was purified according to Ref. 28Rossi-Fanelli A. Antonini E. Caputo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 165-168Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar. When necessary Hb was treated with thiol blocking reagents: 10-fold excess Hg2+ or 3–5-fold excess PMB over Hb tetramer. Solutions of BSA and GSH were used fresh in water, and the concentration of thiols was measured by the Ellman assay (29Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (20884) Google Scholar); GSH had 1.0 ± 0.03 and BSA 0.53 ± 0.02 -SH/molecule. The understoichiometric concentration of free thiols in BSA is in agreement with previous reports (14Scorza G. Pietraforte D. Minetti M. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and probably due to mixed disulfides (30Zhang Y.-Y. Xu A.-M. Nomen M. Walsh M. Keaney Jr., J.F. Loscalzo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14271-14279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 31Demaster E.G. Quast B.J. Redfern B. Nagasawa H.T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11494-11499Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). All BSA concentrations are therefore given with respect to free thiol concentrations, whereas concentration of Hb refers to the tetramer content. NO was purchased from Air Liquide (Paris, France) and purged from higher nitrogen oxides by passage trough a water-alkaline (KOH) trap. Stock solutions of NO were prepared by equilibrating degassed water with the purged NO gas at 1 atm; this yields 2.1 ± 0.1 mm NO at 20 °C (32Koppenol W.H. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1998; 25: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), as also determined by spectrophotometric titration of reduced cytochrome c oxidase (33Stubauer G. Giuffrè A. Brunori M. Sarti P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Solutions of 10 mmCu(I)Cl were always freshly prepared by dissolving 4 mg of CuCl in 4 ml of degassed 50 mm HCl and protecting the solution from light with aluminum foil. All procedures and measurements were carried out at 20 °C. Spectroscopic measurements were performed using a Jasco V550 spectrophotometer (light path: 1 cm). Cu2+ and/or NO were added to air-equilibrated buffer (0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 8.0) containing either GSH or BSA. After 3 min, 1 mm EDTA was added to complex free Cu2+, followed by the addition of 100 μm DTNB. EDTA was required, since thionitrobenzoic acid, the colored species that is released upon reaction of thiols with DTNB, is oxidized by Cu2+. The absorption at 412 nm was measured after stable color formation (1–3 min) and, after subtracting the optical contribution of DTNB, thiol concentration was calculated using the extinction coefficient Δε = 13.6 mm−1cm−1 (experimentally determined and in agreement with Ref.29Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (20884) Google Scholar). Similar experiments have been performed using degassed buffer in a gas-tight cuvette. An air-equilibrated solution of BSA in 0.1 m Hepes buffer, pH 7.5, was incubated for ∼3 min with CuSO4 and NO. Then 1 mm EDTA was added and a spectrum recorded. By subtracting the spectral contribution of Cu2+, determined by performing a parallel experiment in the absence of NO, the absorption change at 340 nm revealed the amount of BSA-SNO formed (19Hogg N. Singh R.S. Kalyanaraman B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Finally, to measure the concentration of unreacted thiols, 100 μm DTNB was added and the absorbance change at 412 nm was determined after subtracting the optical contribution of DTNB. NO was measured amperometrically using a Clark-type NO electrode (ISO-NO, World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) connected to a 5.0-ml gas-tight glass vial sealed with a rubber septum. The electrode was calibrated with subsequent additions of NO-saturated water, and, after sample injection, the NO concentration in the electrode chamber was recorded continuously under constant stirring, at room temperature. Buffer was 0.1 m Hepes, pH 7.5. Amperometric and spectroscopic experiments have been performed to explore the complex interaction of metal ions, NO, thiols, and RS-NOs. The amperometric method is specific for NO (with no response to RS-NOs, nitrite, or NO+), whereas the disappearance of free thiols and the formation of RS-NOs were followed spectroscopically. These experiments, carried out in parallel, provide complementary information, since the formation of RS-NOs implies the disappearance of both NO and free thiols. To investigate a possible role of Cu2+ in the formation of RS-NOs, GSH and BSA were aerobically mixed with: (i) NO, (ii) Cu2+, or (iii) NO plus Cu2+. Following incubation, the concentration of free thiols was determined photometrically by the Ellman reaction. The results in Fig. 1 A show that, when NO and Cu2+ were added together, the free thiols of BSA decreased to 26 ± 3% (n = 3), whereas each reactant alone had essentially no effect (93 ± 2% and 96 ± 3% thiols, n = 3). Complete disappearance of free thiols was observed in the presence of 1 μm neocuproine (Fig. 1 A, iiib), an efficient Cu+chelator (18Gorren A.C.F. Schrammel A. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), suggesting that cuprous ions are formed during the reaction of Cu2+ with BSA; since Cu+ is known to cause degradation of RS-NOs (12Askew S.C. Barnett D.J. McAninly J. Williams D.L.H. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1995; 2: 741-745Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 18Gorren A.C.F. Schrammel A. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), its removal drains the equilibrium toward the complete formation of BSA-SNO. Incubation of GSH with excess NO (for 3 min) had a small effect on the thiol concentration (−30%), while in contrast to BSA, free thiol concentration remarkably decreased (to 13 ± 1%) upon addition of Cu2+ alone (see Fig. 1 B). In the presence of both NO and Cu2+, thiols almost completely disappeared from solution. Similar experiments carried out with ferric instead of cupric ions showed no disappearance of thiols using either BSA or GSH both with and without NO (Fig. 1, A and B). To assess a possible role of O2 in the S-nitrosation of thiols (e.g. through formation of N2O3), similar experiments have been performed also under anaerobic conditions; to make the system sensitive to a putative effect of O2, in these experiments NO was in slight excess over BSA. Under these conditions, ∼40% of thiols disappeared within 3 min of incubation, regardless of the presence or absence of O2 (Fig. 1 C). When followed amperometrically, the NO concentration did not change by addition of either BSA or Cu2+ alone (Fig. 2,A and B). On the other hand, the addition of BSA to a solution of both NO and Cu2+ was associated with disappearance of NO (Fig. 2 B); the reaction was fast (seconds), being limited by the response time of the electrode (34Malinski T. Mesaros S. Tomboulian P. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 58-69Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and yielded a stoichiometry of ∼0.7 NO/BSA. Interestingly addition of 10 μm Cu+ released nearly all the NO uptaken by BSA (Fig. 2 B); this finding provides direct evidence for the formation of BSA-SNO, as Cu+ inducesS-nitrosothiol decomposition with the release of NO (12Askew S.C. Barnett D.J. McAninly J. Williams D.L.H. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1995; 2: 741-745Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar,18Gorren A.C.F. Schrammel A. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The same experiment was performed in the presence of small amounts (1 μm) of neocuproine, chelating Cu+(presumably formed in the reaction of BSA with Cu2+, see “Discussion”); under these conditions (Fig. 2 C) upon addition of BSA, 1 NO/BSA disappeared from solution and the reaction was completely reversed upon addition of excess (over neocuproine) of Cu+. Experiments performed in the presence of higher concentrations of neocuproine (>10 μm) led, after addition of Cu2+, to a slight but significant disappearance of NO from solution independent of BSA (data not shown). This finding can probably be explained by the formation of a Cu2+-neocuproine complex with high affinity for NO. To minimize this side reaction, which can still be observed in Fig.2 C (following addition of Cu2+), neocuproine concentration was fixed at 1 μm. Amperometric measurements have been carried out with either air-equilibrated or N2-equilibrated buffer; despite a clear increase of the spontaneous O2-dependent disappearance of NO observed under aerobic conditions, the extent of NO disappearance caused by BSA addition was similar in both cases (data not shown). The latter result further suggests that O2 has no effect on the reaction of S-nitrosation of BSA (see also Fig.1 C). To assess the involvement of thiol groups in the reaction of BSA and NO, the protein (0.36 mm) was preincubated with excess of either HgCl2 (3 mm) or NEM (10 mm). Upon addition of derivatized BSA to the reaction chamber containing NO and Cu2+, no disappearance of NO was observed (Fig.2 D). Moreover, addition of BSA to a solution containing NO and Fe3+ instead of Cu2+ did not result in a depletion of NO (Fig. 2 E); only some NO disappearance after the addition of Fe3+ (independent of BSA) was observed. Therefore, consistent with the spectroscopic results, a catalytic activity of Fe3+ in BSA-SNO formation can be excluded. Consistently with the spectroscopic results (Fig. 1 B), addition of GSH to a solution of NO and Cu2+ showed no significant disappearance of NO (Fig. 2 F). To test whether other proteins, apart from BSA, can beS-nitrosated through the proposed Cu2+-mediated pathway, S-nitrosation of Hb was investigated by the amperometric NO assay just described. As shown in Fig.3, when Hb either in the deoxy- or oxy-state was anaerobically added to the NO solution, a fast NO disappearance was observed corresponding to NO binding to the hemes in a 1:1 stoichiometry (independent of Hb treatment with thiol blocking reagents). Upon addition of Cu2+, a further rapid disappearance of NO was detected, which was attributed to RS-NO formation, being prevented by treating Hb with thiol blocking reagents (Fig. 3, B and D) and reversed by addition of Cu+ (Fig. 3, A and C). The measured SNO/Hb-tetramer stoichiometry was 1.0–1.2 using deoxy-Hb and 1.4–2.2 using oxy-Hb. The different yield can be tentatively rationalized, considering that the reactivity of Cys-β93 can change depending on the ligation state of Hb (27Jia L. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1996; 380: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1454) Google Scholar). BSA-SNO formed during incubation of BSA with Cu2+ and NO was determined spectroscopically (Fig. 4). RS-NOs are characterized by a weak absorbance band with a maximum at 340 nm (19Hogg N. Singh R.S. Kalyanaraman B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Owing to the low extinction coefficient of BSA-SNO, all concentrations were increased by 1–2 orders of magnitude. Incubation of BSA at different concentrations (0–100 μm) with constant amounts of NO and Cu2+ showed an absorbance increase at 340 nm (Fig. 4 A), which was not observed in the absence of Cu2+. The linear regression of the data in Fig.4 B allowed us to calculate an extinction coefficient for BSA-SNO at 340 nm: ε = 0.77 mm−1cm−1, in reasonable agreement with the published ε = 0.87 mm−1 cm−1 at 334 nm (35Meyer D.J. Kramer H. Ozer N. Coles B. Ketterer B. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and very close to ε = 0.76 mm−1cm−1 for GSNO (19Hogg N. Singh R.S. Kalyanaraman B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). When 1 mm EDTA was added to the solution containing BSA and Cu2+ before addition of NO, BSA-SNO formation was fully prevented (data not shown). BSA was aerobically incubated with variable amounts of NO (0–200 μm) in the presence of Cu2+. Then, excess EDTA was added to complex free cupric ions and both the formation of BSA-SNO and the concentration of free thiols (after the addition of 100 μm DTNB) were spectroscopically measured. As shown in Fig. 5, upon increasing the NO concentration, the fraction of free cysteine of BSA decreases while the BSA-SNO concentration increases. The reaction is very efficient since, even at a 1:1 NO-to-BSA ratio, ≈70% of the reaction has occurred. Fig. 6 (data set a) reports the concentration of free thiols measured following the aerobic addition of BSA to constant amount of NO and varying the concentration of Cu2+ (0–70 μm). As shown in the figure, up to a Cu2+-to-BSA ratio of 1:1, essentially no disappearance of free cysteines was observed; the further increase of Cu2+ led to a linear decrease of free cysteines up to 35–40% of the initial level. Further addition of Cu2+ was ineffective even up to a Cu2+-to-BSA ratio of 10:1. The same experiment carried out in the presence of 70 μm neocuproine showed a similar profile, but a remarkable increase of the reaction efficiency (Fig. 6, data set b); the complete disappearance of free cysteines is already observed at a Cu2+-to-BSA ratio of 4:1. Taken together, these findings imply that formation and stability of BSA-SNO crucially depend on the relative concentrations of NO, Cu2+, BSA, and Cu+ (the latter likely formed in the reaction between BSA and Cu2+). We found that, in the presence of NO, cupric ions can induce a fast S-nitrosation of both BSA and Hb, used as model systems, whereas ferric ions are in this respect ineffective. This conclusion is based on amperometric and spectroscopic measurements. (i) Amperometric experiments (Fig. 2) showed that NO disappears from solution in a ∼1:1 NO-to-BSA ratio in the presence of both BSA and Cu2+, but not in the presence of either BSA or Cu2+ alone. BSA-SNO formation is indicated by the NO release observed upon addition of Cu+ to the reaction mixture, which is known to cause the decomposition of RS-NOs with a release of NO (12Askew S.C. Barnett D.J. McAninly J. Williams D.L.H. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1995; 2: 741-745Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 18Gorren A.C.F. Schrammel A. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Similar experiments carried out with Hb induced its S-nitrosation with an observed stoichiometry dependent on the Hb derivative used, i.e. oxygenated or deoxygenated (Fig. 3). (ii) Spectroscopic measurements showed that the reactive Cys-34 of BSA decreased close to zero if the protein was incubated with NO and Cu2+, but not with either one of the two reagents separately (Fig. 1). (iii) Formation of BSA-SNO was followed by the characteristic absorbance of the S-NO bond (maximum at 340 nm) in samples where increasing concentrations of BSA were incubated with NO and Cu2+ (Fig. 4); the extinction coefficient at 340 nm was determined, ε = 0.77 mm−1cm−1, in agreement with the literature (35Meyer D.J. Kramer H. Ozer N. Coles B. Ketterer B. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). (iv) Upon addition of increasing amounts of NO to BSA in the presence of Cu2+, we observed a decrease of the free thiol concentration and a parallel increase of the amount of BSA-SNO (Fig.5). The sum of free thiol and S-NO accounted for the total amount of thiols independently calculated. The yield of BSA-SNO in experiments carried out in the absence or presence of O2 was the same. Based also on the finding that no reaction was observed following the aerobic incubation of BSA with NO (in the absence of Cu2+), we can exclude a role of oxygen in this process (see Fig. 2 A). The concentration of BSA was, in any case, much too low (micromolar) to efficiently compete with water in the reaction with N2O3 formed in the auto-oxidation reaction of NO (21Kharitonov V.G. Sundquist A.R. Sharma V.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28158-28164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Taken together, the evidence summarized above suggests the mechanism shown in Scheme FS1 for the copper-mediated formation/degradation of BSA-SNO. The sulfhydryl group of Cys-34 of BSA binds Cu2+ forming a copper-thiol complex, which reacts with NO to yield BSA-SNO. This mechanism is proposed as both Cu2+ and BSA are needed for the reaction with NO; it is interesting to notice that Fe3+was in this respect ineffective. The formation of a copper-BSA complex is also suggested by the experiments performed in the presence of excess neocuproine; the formation of a Cu+-neocuproine complex, characterized by a weak absorbance between 400 and 500 nm (36Smith G.F. McCurdy K. Anal. Chem. 1952; 24: 371-373Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar), was in fact observed only upon addition of NO to BSA and Cu2+, indicating that (i) the copper-BSA complex is itself rather stable (minutes) and (ii) the release of Cu+ may occur only after the attack of NO to form an S-NO bond. The mechanism presented in Scheme FS1 is novel, insofar as the copper-mediated reaction of NO with thiols does not directly involve NO+, as previously suggested (8Stamler J.S. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Science. 1992; 258: 1898-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (2430) Google Scholar, 21Kharitonov V.G. Sundquist A.R. Sharma V.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 29244-29249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and here reported (Scheme FS2). NO+ is known to react with water to form nitrite; therefore, in the presence of Cu2+ the equilibrium depicted in Scheme FS2 should be shifted toward NO+ and NO should rapidly disappear. However, this was not observed in the amperometric measurements reported in Fig. 2, which demonstrate instead that, even in the presence of a 5-fold excess of Cu2+, no significant disappearance of free NO occurs, a finding that rules out a significant role of NO+ in RS-NO formation at least at micromolar amounts of Cu2+. Scheme FS1 seems also to be supported by the standard reduction potentials, which favor the reduction of copper ions by thiols rather than by NO (see Table I). Indeed, it is known that Cu2+ readily oxidizes GSH and cysteine (37Cavallini D. De Marco C. Duprè S. Rotilio G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1969; 130: 351-361Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar).Table IStandard reduction potentials taken from Refs. 32Koppenol W.H. Free Radical Biol.

CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1996: 20-25Google Scholar Open table in a new tab The kinetics of formation, as well as the structure of copper-thiol complexes, particularly those with GSH or cysteine, are well described in the literature: Cu2+ is chelated by the thiolate sulfur of glutathione probably forming a 2:1 Cu2+-GSSG complex (38Kroneck P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1975; 97: 3839-3841Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 39Miyoshi K. Sugiura Y. Ishizu K. Iitaka Y. Nakamura H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 6130-6136Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar); both the complex-formation and the involved redox reaction (see Scheme FS3, taken from Ref. 38Kroneck P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1975; 97: 3839-3841Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) are estimated to be very fast (∼108m−1 s−1 and ∼110 s−1; Ref. 18Gorren A.C.F. Schrammel A. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). A more general mechanism, including the reactions depicted in Schemes FS1and FS3 and the Cu+-induced decomposition of RS-NO, is reported in Scheme FS4. This model provides also a simple explanation for the totally different reactivities of the “small” glutathione and the “large” BSA or Hb with Cu2+ and NO. The addition of GSH to the electrode chamber containing NO and Cu2+ was not followed by disappearance of NO, while the incubation of GSH with Cu2+in a spectroscopic cuvette led to complete disappearance of thiols (Fig. 1 B). Both findings can be explained assuming that Cu2+ induces prompt dimerization of GSH, the reaction being in kinetic competition with the formation of GSNO. Judging from our results, although the reaction of NO with glutathione may be fast, it is overruled by the faster dimerization (see Scheme FS4). This is not surprising as the activated thiols in the Cu2+-glutathione complex are in very close proximity (∼5 Å, taken from crystallographic data; Ref. 38Kroneck P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1975; 97: 3839-3841Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In contrast, the lifetime of the BSA-copper complex is longer since dimerization and disulfide formation is hindered by steric restriction. Radi et al. (40Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-4250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that dimerization of BSA is only observed under denaturing conditions, and oxidation to sulfenic or sulfinic acid only occurs in the presence of strong oxidants, such as peroxynitrite. Consistently with these observations, following incubation of BSA with Cu2+ (15 min), we did not detect a decrease of the free thiol concentration. This finding excludes fast oxidation of Cys-34 and dimerization of BSA, allowing study of the role of Cu2+ in the reaction of thiols with NO. The results shown in Fig. 6 indicate that Cu2+ enhances in a concentration-dependent manner theS-nitrosation of BSA. The formation of BSA-SNO strictly depends (at constant NO) on the relative concentrations of Cu2+ and BSA, although up to a Cu2+/BSA ratio of 1:1 no disappearance of thiols was observed. The further increase of Cu2+ led to a sharp decrease of free thiols. This finding is consistent with BSA having two copper binding sites, as also suggested by Kashiba-Iwatsuki et al. (31Demaster E.G. Quast B.J. Redfern B. Nagasawa H.T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11494-11499Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar); the first (high affinity) site is inactive, and the second is involved in the reaction with NO. Kashiba-Iwatsuki et al. (31Demaster E.G. Quast B.J. Redfern B. Nagasawa H.T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11494-11499Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) suggested that Cu2+ binds to BSA with high affinity to the N-terminal domain (amino group of Asp-1 and imidazole group of His-3) and with lower affinity to Cys-34. Therefore, Cu2+ would first saturate the high affinity binding site and then react with Cys-34 allowing BSA-SNO formation, in the presence of NO. Blocking the thiol with Hg2+ or NEM completely prevented the reaction with NO. The incomplete formation of BSA-SNO observed amperometrically and spectroscopically is probably related to the presence of Cu+ formed in the reaction of Cu2+ with BSA (see Schemes FS1 and FS4). As reported above, Cu+ is known to catalyze the decomposition of RS-NOs releasing NO and disulfides (12Askew S.C. Barnett D.J. McAninly J. Williams D.L.H. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1995; 2: 741-745Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar,18Gorren A.C.F. Schrammel A. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In situ formation of Cu+ would therefore decompose BSA-SNO favoring the back reaction. The extent of the RS-NO formation, should therefore depend on the Cu+/Cu2+ ratio, controlling the relative formation and decomposition kinetics. As expected, experiments performed in the presence of neocuproine, a specific Cu+chelator (with lower affinity for Cu2+), remarkably increased the efficiency of BSA-SNO formation (Fig. 6). As proved by the prompt Cu2+-mediated nitrosation of Hb, followed by the release of NO induced by Cu+, the mechanism presented can also be viewed as a new synthetic method for in vitro S-nitrosation of proteins. It displays several advantages over conventional methods. Commonly,S-nitrosation is achieved by incubation with low molecular weight RS-NOs like GSNO or S-nitrosocysteine. To allow complete reaction they have to be used in large excess over the protein and therefore, to check the yield of protein nitrosation, often a separation step is necessary. As the reactions described here are efficient, complete formation of RS-NO is achieved even at micromolar concentrations of reactants; under these conditions the reaction can be directly followed either spectroscopically or amperometrically, without the need of a separation step. Finally, it may be of interest to speculate also on a role of copper ions in the intra- and extracellular NO traffic. However, most of Cu2+ is incorporated into ceruloplasmin (95% of plasma copper; Ref. 41Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 219: 1-14Crossref Scopus (4504) Google Scholar), metallothioneines, and albumin (41Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 219: 1-14Crossref Scopus (4504) Google Scholar); therefore, the extra- and intracellular concentration of “free” copper ions is very low (42Scudder P.R. Al-Timimi D. McMurray W. White A.G. Zoob B.C. Dormandy T.L. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1978; 37: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 43Scudder P.R. McMurray W. White A.G. Dormandy T.L. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1978; 37: 71-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Although we cannot assess a physiological relevance of the reactions presented, it would be appropriate to further investigate a possible role for copper ions in in vivo S-nitrosation.

Notably, the neuronal/pancreatic β-cell receptor, SUR1, imparts high sensitivity to hypoglycemic sulfonylureas (SUs;e.g. glibenclamide) and low to potassium channel openers (KCOs; e.g. P1075), whereas the opposite drug sensitivities are conferred by cardiovascular receptors, SUR2A and SUR2B. By exchanging domains between SUR1 and SUR2B, we identify two regions (KCO I: Thr1059–Leu1087 and KCO II: Arg1218–Asn1320; rat SUR2 numbering) within the second set of transmembrane domains (TMDII) as critical for KCO binding. Swapping both regions reconstitutes KCO affinities and sensitivities of the donor SUR isoform. High glibenclamide affinity of SUR1 is not reduced by transfer of KCO I plus II from SUR2B, demonstrating that high SU and KCO affinity can coexist in the same SUR molecule. Consistently, high SU affinity was imparted on SUR2B by substituting the region separating KCO I and II (Ile1088–Val1217) with the corresponding domain of SUR1. We infer the receptor sites for KCOs and SUs to be closely associated within a regulatory domain (Thr1059–Asn1320) in TMDII of SURs.

Unraveling the molecular basis for these divergent drug sensitivities and understanding the mechanisms involved in drug-induced modulation of KATP channel activity is of key importance for design of tissue specific compounds. Here, we report two regions within the second set of transmembrane domains (TMDII) of SURs to be essential for KCO binding and action. [3H]P1075 (specific activity 116 Ci mmol−1) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Freiburg, Germany). [3H]Glibenclamide (specific activity 51 Ci mmol−1) was from NEN Life Science Products (Dreieich, Germany). All other chemicals and drugs were obtained from the sources described elsewhere (16Schwanstecher M. Sieverding C. Dörschner H. Gross I. Aguilar-Bryan L. Schwanstecher C. Bryan J.

Stock solutions of drugs were prepared in KOH (50 mm) or dimethyl sulfoxide with a final solvent concentration in the media below 1%. Chimeras comprising segments from hamster SUR1 (GenBankTM accession number A56248) or rat SUR2B (GenBankTM accession number AF087838) were constructed using standard molecular biology techniques. Products were subcloned into the pECE vector (4Aguilar-Bryan L. Nichols C.G. Wechsler S.W. Clement J.P., IV Boyd III, A.E. Gonzalez G. Herrera-Sosa H. Nguy K. Bryan J. Nelson D.A. Science. 1995; 268: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar) and sequenced to verify constructs and polymerase chain reaction fidelity before transfection. Composition of chimeras was as follows (numbers indicate amino acid boundaries of SUR2B or SUR1 as indicated; see also Fig. 1 A): chimera I (1–675, SUR2B)-(687–901, SUR1)-(880–1545, SUR2B); chimera II (1–1087, SUR2B)-(1121–1250, SUR1)-(1218–1545, SUR2B); chimera III (1–1320, SUR2B)- (1358–1582, SUR1); chimera IV (1–919, SUR2B)-(942–1091, SUR1)-(1059–1545, SUR2B); chimera V (1–686, SUR1)-(676–1545, SUR2B); chimera VI (1–1058, SUR2B)-(1092–1120, SUR1)-(1088–1545, SUR2B); chimera VII (1–1217, SUR2B)-(1251–1357, SUR1)-(1321–1545, SUR2B); chimera VIII (1–1091, SUR1)-(1059–1087, SUR2B)-(1121–1582, SUR1); chimera IX (1–1250, SUR1)-(1218–1320, SUR2B)-(1358–1582, SUR1); chimera X (1–1091, SUR1)-(1059–1087, SUR2B)-(1121–1250, SUR1)-(1218–1320, SUR2B)-(1358–1582, SUR1). Transfections and membrane preparations were performed as described previously (16Schwanstecher M. Sieverding C. Dörschner H. Gross I. Aguilar-Bryan L. Schwanstecher C. Bryan J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5529-5535Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 19Schwanstecher M. Brandt C. Behrends S. Schaupp U. Panten U. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 106: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, COS-7 cells cultured in DMEM-HG (10 mm glucose), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, were plated at a density of 5 × 105cells per dish (94 mm) and allowed to attach overnight. 200 μg of pECE-SUR complementary DNA were used to transfect 10 plates. For transfection the cells were incubated 4 h in a Tris-buffered salt solution containing DNA (5–10 μg/ml) plus DEAE-dextran (1 mg/ml), 2 min in HEPES-buffered salt solution plus dimethyl sulfoxide (10%) and 4 h in DMEM-HG plus chloroquine (100 μm). Cells were then returned to DMEM-HG plus 10% fetal calf serum. Membranes were prepared 60–72 h posttransfection as described (19Schwanstecher M. Brandt C. Behrends S. Schaupp U. Panten U. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 106: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For binding experiments resuspended membranes (final protein concentration 5–50 μg/ml) were incubated in Tris buffer (50 mm, pH 7.4) containing either [3H]P1075 (final concentration 3 nm, nonspecific binding defined by 100 μmpinacidil) or [3H]glibenclamide (final concentration 0.3 nm, nonspecific binding defined by 100 nmglibenclamide) and other additions as shown in the figure. The free Mg2+ concentration was kept close to 0.7 mm. In P1075 assays (Fig. 1, A and B), MgATP (0.1 mm) was added to incubation media to enable KCO binding (16Schwanstecher M. Sieverding C. Dörschner H. Gross I. Aguilar-Bryan L. Schwanstecher C. Bryan J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5529-5535Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Low affinity P1075 binding to SUR1 isoforms (Fig. 1 A) was measured via allosteric displacement of [3H]glibenclamide as described previously (16Schwanstecher M. Sieverding C. Dörschner H. Gross I. Aguilar-Bryan L. Schwanstecher C. Bryan J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5529-5535Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Incubations were carried out for 1 h at room temperature and were terminated by rapid filtration through Whatman GF/B filters. Transfections were performed as described above with the following modification. COS-7 cells were plated at a density of 8 × 104 cells per dish (35 mm). 20 μg of pECE-SUR complementary DNA and 20 μg of pECE-mouse KIR6.2 complementary DNA (GenBankTMD50581) were mixed and used to transfect six 35-mm plates. Experiments in the inside-out configuration of the patch-clamp technique were performed 1–2 days after transfection at room temperature as described previously (20Schwanstecher M. Schwanstecher C. Dickel C. Chudziak F. Moshiri A. Panten U. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 113: 903-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Membrane patches were clamped at −50 mV. The intracellular bath solution contained (mm) 140 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 0.7 free Mg2+, 10 EGTA, 5 HEPES (pH 7.3) and the pipette solution 146 KCl, 2.6 CaCl2, 1.2 MgCl2, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4). For registration of concentration-response curves (Fig.1 D) patches were chosen with little “run-down” over the measuring period and drug effects were corrected for this loss of channel activity by use of linear interpolation. Artifacts due to incomplete drug washout or slow reversibility were excluded by making sure that cumulative experiments with stepwise increase or decrease of the drug concentration yielded identical EC50 values and slope factors. Channel activity (A) was defined as the product of the number of functional channels (n) and the probability of the channels being in the open state (p). A was calculated by dividing the mean current (I) by the single-channel current amplitude (i). Density of KATP channels per patch ranged from 15 to 50. Varying channel densities did not affect EC50 values or Hill coefficients. Data analysis (including calculation ofKD values from IC50 values), and statistics were performed as described (19Schwanstecher M. Brandt C. Behrends S. Schaupp U. Panten U. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 106: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 20Schwanstecher M. Schwanstecher C. Dickel C. Chudziak F. Moshiri A. Panten U. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 113: 903-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Results shown as mean ± S.E. (n = 3–16). The pharmacological hallmark of SUR2B is its high affinity for KCOs, the KD for P1075 (rat; 11 ± 2 nm) being approximately 100,000-fold lower than that of SUR1 (hamster; 1.06 ± 0.1 mm; see also Ref. 16Schwanstecher M. Sieverding C. Dörschner H. Gross I. Aguilar-Bryan L. Schwanstecher C. Bryan J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5529-5535Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Based on this huge affinity difference the KCO receptor site was localized by systematically substituting corresponding domains between both isoforms (Fig. 1 A). Whereas both NBFs (chimera I and III; KD = 13 ± 2 nm or 10 ± 1 nm, respectively) and TMDs 14–15 (chimera II; KD = 14 ± 2 nm) did not contribute to discrepant affinities, small, 3–5-fold reductions of SUR2B's P1075 affinity were induced by replacing TMDs 12–13 (chimera IV; KD = 31 ± 5 nm) or 1–11 (chimera V; KD = 48 ± 4 nm), indicating these latter domains to interfere with the binding process either directly or indirectly. Two regions, part of the cytosolic loop between TMD 13 and 14 (KCO I: Thr1059–Leu1087; chimera VI) and TMDs 16–17 (KCO II: Arg1218–Asn1320; chimera VII), however, were identified to be essential, with complete loss of detectable [3H]P1075 binding resulting from substitution. Consistently, combined transfer of these domains into SUR1 induced a 6,200-fold increase of P1075 affinity (chimera X; KD= 0.17 ± 0.02 μm), whereas split substitutions mediated small, 1.5–4-fold enhancements (chimera VIII and IX;KD = 0.65 ± 0.08 mm or 0.24 ± 0.04 mm, respectively), implying both domains to interact in formation of the KCO binding site. Strong gain of P1075 affinity in chimera X was paralleled by affinity increments for pinacidil (270 fold; KD = 1.8 ± 0.2 μm) and levcromakalim (>50-fold;KD = 10 ± 2 μm), thus reconstituting the SUR2B characteristic rank order (Fig. 1 B; see Ref. 16Schwanstecher M. Sieverding C. Dörschner H. Gross I. Aguilar-Bryan L. Schwanstecher C. Bryan J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5529-5535Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar for KCO binding to SUR1). Binding was matched by drug action (Fig. 1, C and D), with P1075 sensitivity of channels reconstituted with the loss-of-affinity constructs (chimera VI or VII) resembling that mediated by SUR1 (EC50 > 1 mm; results shown for chimera VII only) and the gain-of-affinity chimera X conferring potencies (P1075, EC50 = 0.61 ± 0.12 μm; pinacidil, EC50 = 13 ± 5 μm; levcromakalim, EC50 = 52 ± 11 μm) similar to wild type SUR2B. Notably, glibenclamide affinity of chimera X (KD = 0.68 ± 0.05 nm; Fig. 1 E) equaled that of SUR1 (KD = 0.72 nm; Ref. 18Dörschner H. Brekardin E. Uhde I. Schwanstecher C. Schwanstecher M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 1060-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), suggesting KCO I and II not to form part of the SU receptor site and indicating that high affinity binding of SUs and KCOs can be combined within the same isoform. A region overlapping that separating KCO I and II was recently reported to be critical for SU sensitivity (21Ashfield R. Gribble F.M. Ashcroft S.J.H. Ashcroft F.M. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1341-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Consistently, we found substitution of this linking region (SUBR: Ile1088-Val1217; Fig. 1 F) by the corresponding domain of SUR1 (Ile1121–Val1250; chimera II) to significantly enhance SU affinities (210-fold for glibenclamide, KD = 1.2 ± 0.15 nm; 280-fold for glipizide, KD = 22 ± 3 nm; 14-fold for tolbutamide, KD = 19 ± 2 μm; see Ref. 18Dörschner H. Brekardin E. Uhde I. Schwanstecher C. Schwanstecher M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 1060-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar for SU binding to SUR 2B) with dissociation constants resembling that of wild type SUR1 (Fig.1 E). Similar to KCOs, affinity increments were paralleled by drug action. Glibenclamide sensitivity of channels transiently reconstituted from chimera II plus KIR6.2 (EC50= 0.22 ± 0.09 nm; n = 4; results not shown in a figure) was 190-fold higher than that of SUR2B/KIR6.2 channels (EC50 = 42 nm; Ref. 18Dörschner H. Brekardin E. Uhde I. Schwanstecher C. Schwanstecher M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 1060-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) coinciding with the drug's potency to inhibit activity of SUR1/KIR6.2 channels (EC50 = 0.13 nm; Ref. 18Dörschner H. Brekardin E. Uhde I. Schwanstecher C. Schwanstecher M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 1060-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Expression rates of the chimeras did not differ markedly from that of the wild type receptors, ranging from 10 to 50 pmol/mg of membrane protein as calculated from maximal number of binding sites (chimeras I–V and VIII–X) or estimated from reconstituted channel activity (chimeras VI and VII). This study is the first to localize regions in SURs critical for formation of the KCO binding pocket and to establish that high affinity KCO and SU binding can coexist within the same isoform. These conclusions are based on the following findings. 1) Substitution of two regions within TMDII of SUR2B (KCO I and II, Fig. 1 F) with the corresponding domains of SUR1 (chimera VI and VII) induced a complete loss of detectable [3H]P1075 binding (Fig.1 A). 2) Simultaneous transfer of these regions into SUR1 (chimera X) strongly increased KCO affinities (6,200-fold for P1075) reproducing the SUR2B characteristic binding pattern for P1075, pinacidil, and levcromakalim (Fig. 1, A and B). 3) High glibenclamide affinity of SUR1 was not reduced by this transfer (Fig. 1 E). 4) Loss or gain of KCO affinity were paralleled by corresponding sensitivity changes of channels reconstituted with KIR6.2 (Fig. 1, C and D). The regions critical for KCO binding reside in TMDII forming part of the putative intracellular loop connecting TMD 13 and 14 (KCO I: Thr1059–Leu1087, SUR2 numbering) and the domain preceding NBF2 (KCO II: Arg1218–Asn1320, SUR2 numbering) (Fig.1 F). Either of the two regions proved essential for reconstitution of the SUR2B characteristic pattern of high KCO affinities, strongly arguing that both domains interact in formation of the binding pocket. However, since TMDs 1–11 (chimera V) and 12–13 (chimera IV) were required for full KCO affinity, additional regions might be involved (Fig. 1 A). Similarly, we have shown recently that the C-terminal 42 amino acids affect KCO affinity by a factor of 3–5 with SUR1 = SUR2B > SUR2A (16Schwanstecher M. Sieverding C. Dörschner H. Gross I. Aguilar-Bryan L. Schwanstecher C. Bryan J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5529-5535Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Identification of KCO I in a putative intracellular loop suggests localization of the receptor site at the internal face of the plasma membrane implying that, equivalent to SUs (20Schwanstecher M. Schwanstecher C. Dickel C. Chudziak F. Moshiri A. Panten U. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 113: 903-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), KCOs have to cross the membrane to exert their effect. This finding also hints the putative intracellular part of KCO II (Ala1266–Asn1320, SUR2B numbering; Fig. 1, F and G) to act as counterpart of KCO I in formation of the site. Albeit, limiting substitutions to this part of KCO II (plus KCO I) did not lead to reconstitution of high KCO affinity (results not shown). Importantly, high SU affinity could be conferred on SUR2B by substituting the region separating KCO I and II (SUBR: Ile1088–Val1217, SUR2 numbering; Fig.1 F) by the corresponding domain of SUR1 (chimera II). Since this transfer did perfectly reconstitute affinities of SUR1 for glibenclamide, glipizide, and tolbutamide (Fig. 1 E), the results strongly suggest SUBR to form the SU binding site, thus supporting conclusions from a recent study (21Ashfield R. Gribble F.M. Ashcroft S.J.H. Ashcroft F.M. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1341-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). We infer TMDs 14–17 (Thr1059–Asn1320, SUR2 numbering) within TMDII of SURs to be of key importance for drug-induced KATP channel modulation with the core region of this regulatory domain forming the binding site for SUs (SUBR) and the flanking regions (KCO I and KCO II) constituting main parts of the receptor site for KCOs (Fig. 1 F). The idea of distinct (although closely associated) sites is supported by substitution of SUBR lacking an effect on P1075 affinity (chimera II, Fig.1 A) and transfer of KCO I and II not affecting theKD for glibenclamide (chimera X, Fig. 1,A and E). Close local association of SU and KCO binding regions, on the other hand, conforms with evidence for negative allosteric coupling of the sites (15Hambrock A. Löffler-Walz C. Kurachi Y. Quast U. Br.

Notably, pharmacological properties of SUR1 and SUR2B were combined in either chimera II and X (Fig. 1, A and E), thus establishing for the first time high affinity for KCOs and SUs not to be mutually exclusive. Hence, native SUR isoforms with similar properties might exist, and accordingly evidence for a receptor with high P1075 and glibenclamide affinity has been presented recently in vascular smooth muscle (25Löffler-Walz C. Quast U. Naunyn Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1998; 357: 183-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Both chimeras provide excellent tools for further analysis of functional interaction between the drug sites. High KCO and SU affinities of chimeras II and X matched sensitivities of channels transiently reconstituted with KIR6.2 (see “Results” and Fig. 1, B–E). This finding implies that SUR isoforms use identical mechanisms to transduce drug binding to the regulatory domain (KCO I + SUBR + KCO II; Thr1059–Asn1320, SUR2 numbering; Fig.1 F) into modulation of channel activity. It might be argued that the regulatory domain does not form the receptor sites itself but indirectly affects KCO or SU binding in other regions. Although this possibility cannot be ruled out, it is unlikely to explain restitution of the correct rank order of affinities (Fig. 1,B and E). The study provides new insight into the molecular mechanisms of drug-induced KATP channel regulation. We conclude the receptor sites for KCOs and SUs to be closely associated within a regulatory domain in TMDII of SURs.

By microinjecting 3T3-L1 adipocytes with the Clostridium botulinum toxin B or E, which proteolyzed synaptobrevin-2/cellubrevin and SNAP-23, respectively, we investigated the role of these SNAREs in GLUT4, GLUT1, and transferrin receptor trafficking. As expected, insulin stimulated the translocation of GLUT4, GLUT1, and transferrin receptors to the plasma membrane. By contrast, a constitutively active protein kinase B (PKB-DD) only stimulated a translocation of GLUT4 and not GLUT1 or the transferrin receptor. The GLUT4 response to PKB-DD was abolished by toxins B or E, whereas the insulin-evoked translocation of GLUT4 was inhibited by approximately 65%. These toxins had no significant effect on insulin-stimulated transferrin receptor appearance at the cell surface. Thus, insulin appears to induce GLUT4 translocation via two distinct routes, only one of which involves SNAP-23 and synaptobrevin-2/cellubrevin, and can be mobilized by PKB-DD. The PKB-, SNAP-23-, and synaptobrevin-2/cellubrevin-independent GLUT4 translocation pathway may involve movement through recycling endosomes, together with GLUT1 and transferrin receptors. An interaction of SNAP-23 and syntaxin 4 on the plasma membrane with vesicle-associated synaptobrevin-2 and/or cellubrevin, known as SNAP (soluble N-ethyl-maleimide-sensitive factorattachment protein) receptors or SNAREs, has been proposed to provide the targeting and/or fusion apparatus for insulin-stimulated translocation of the GLUT4 isoform of glucose transporter to the plasma membrane.

The PKB-, SNAP-23-, and synaptobrevin-2/cellubrevin-independent GLUT4 translocation pathway may involve movement through recycling endosomes, together with GLUT1 and transferrin receptors. In muscle, adipose tissue, and 3T3-L1 adipocytes, insulin primarily increases glucose uptake by promoting the trafficking of vesicles containing GLUT4 (glucose transporter isoform 4) to the plasma membrane (reviewed in Refs. 1Holman G.D. Kasuga M. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 991-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar and2Kandror K.V. Pilch P.F. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 34: E1-E14Crossref Google Scholar). In the resting state, the majority of GLUT4 resides in vesicles distributed throughout the cell interior, with a fraction of GLUT4 undergoing cycling between the plasma membrane and several intracellular sorting compartments. Insulin triggers a substantial translocation of GLUT4-containing vesicles to the plasma membrane, a phenomenon that can largely explain the increase inVmax of the glucose uptake observed. A detailed molecular description of how insulin promotes this translocation is presently lacking, although some of the components involved in the signaling process and the fusion events have been identified. Binding of insulin to its receptor activates the integral tyrosine kinase, which then elicits a cascade of cellular signaling responses, including phosphorylation of the cytosolic proteins of the insulin-receptor-substrate family (reviewed in Ref. 3Yenush L. White M.F. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar).

The lipid product of this enzyme, namely phosphatidylinositide 3,4,5-trisphosphate, promotes the phosphorylation and activation of the serine/threonine-kinase called protein kinase B (PKB; also known as RAC or Akt) via two protein kinases named PDK1 and PDK2 (7Alessi D.R.

Rothman J. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2589) Google Scholar) have proposed that the core of the synaptic-clear vesicle docking/fusion complex comprises two plasma membrane proteins, syntaxin 1 and SNAP-25 (synaptosomal protein with a molecular mass of 25 kDa), which interact with synaptobrevin (Sbr) on the vesicle. This provides the targeting specificity and/or the fusion apparatus necessary for neurotransmitter release at the active zones of nerve endings. Additionally, these three proteins serve as receptors for the cytosolic factors N-ethyl-maleimide-sensitive factor and SNAP (soluble N-ethyl-maleimide-sensitive factorattachment protein), which collectively regulate the ternary associations and, therefore, are referred to as SNAREs (SNAP receptors). SNAP-25 and syntaxin 1, located predominantly on the targeted plasma membrane, are referred to as t-SNAREs, whereas vesicle located Sbr is the v-SNARE (11Söllner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M.

In this study we have investigated the mechanism by which insulin and a constitutively active PKB (PKB-DD) induce the translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane of 3T3-L1 adipocytes. BoNT/B and BoNT/E, which specifically cleave Sbr-2/Cbr and SNAP-23, respectively, completely blocked the effect of PKB-DD but only partially blocked the effect of insulin. We also found that insulin, but not PKB-DD, caused GLUT1 and TfR translocation, in a manner that was insensitive to the actions of BoNT/B and/E. Collectively, our results support the hypothesis (16Olson A.L. Knight J.B. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2425-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 23Martin L.B. Shewan A.

The plasmid pGFP-GLUT4 has been described elsewhere (44Oatey P.B. Van Weering D.H.J. Dobson S.P. Gould G.W. Tavaré J.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 637-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The pCMV5 vector was also used to overexpress wild-type and constitutively active (-DD; containing substitutions of Thr308 and Ser473for aspartic acid residues) forms of PKB (45Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2476) Google Scholar), and were kindly provided by Drs. Brian Hemmings (Friedrich Miescher Institute, Basel) and Dario Alessi (University of Dundee). Antibodies were raised in rabbits against a soluble recombinant His6-tagged form of mouse syntaxin 1A, lacking the last 27 C-terminal residues, and were affinity-purified on the immobilized antigen (32Foran P. Lawrence G.W. Shone C.C. Foster K. Dolly J.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2630-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Affinity-purified Ig raised against residues 33–94 of human Sbr-2 (a region of amino acid sequence shared with Sbr and Cbr; Ref. 12McMahon H.T. Ushkaryov Y.A. Edelmann L. Link E. Binz T. Niemann H. Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 364: 346-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) was prepared, as detailed elsewhere (32Foran P. Lawrence G.W. Shone C.C. Foster K. Dolly J.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2630-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Because only poor sequence identities exist between Sbr-2/VAMP-2 and the other recently identified mammalian VAMP isoforms 4–8 (46Advani R.J. Bae H.-R. Bock J.B. Chao Y.-C.D. Prekeris R. Yoo J.-S. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10317-10324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), their immunoreactivity with this antibody is not expected. Moreover, VAMP isoforms 4–8 are unlikely to be proteolyzed by BoNT/B because of their sequence diversites (47Shone C.C. Roberts A.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Likewise, a rabbit antiserum to the C terminus of SNAP-25 (residues 195–206) was produced and affinity-purified (48Lawrence G.W. Foran P. Dolly J.O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Antisera were generated in rabbits against peptides corresponding to the C-terminal 11 residues of human SNAP-23 (ANARAKKLIDS); specific Ig was affinity-isolated from immune sera using the immunogenic peptide coupled via its additional N-terminal cysteine to iodoacetyl-Sepharose 4B (prepared as detailed in Ref. 48Lawrence G.W. Foran P. Dolly J.O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Each affinity-purified Ig was tested to ensure that it labeled the requisite protein of appropriateMr on Western blots in a manner that was preventable by inclusion of the immunogen (data not shown). Isolated BoNT/A, BoNT/B, BoNT/C1, and BoNT/E were purified and fully nicked, where necessary, as described previously (21Chen F. Foran P. Shone C.C. Foster K.A. Dolly J.O. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5719-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 48Lawrence G.W. Foran P. Dolly J.O. Eur. J.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3061-3067Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar); all were shown to be of high purity by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with Coomassie staining of protein and found to exhibit the high levels of toxicity (assessed by mouse bioassay) as published. Bovine chromaffin cells were prepared from adrenal glands and maintained in culture, as detailed elsewhere (50Lawrence G.W. Weller U. Dolly J.O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were prepared as outlined before (21Chen F. Foran P. Shone C.C. Foster K.A. Dolly J.O. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5719-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Cells (0.5 × 106 cells/well) were washed three times with buffer A (136 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mmNaH2PO4, 5 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). They were then permeabilized at 37 °C using 40 μm digitonin in KGEP buffer (139 mm K+ glutamate, 20 mm PIPES-HCl, pH 7.0, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin A) in the absence or presence of prereduced BoNT/A, BoNT/B, BoNT/C1, or BoNT/E (at the concentrations given in the figure legends). More than 95% of the cells (of the three different lines employed) exhibited nuclear staining by trypan blue, confirming the efficacy of permeabilization. BoNTs were reduced with 20 mm dithiothreitol in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl for a minimum of 30 min at 37 °C before dilution in digitonin-KGEP and application to cells; neurotoxin-free control cells were exposed to the same final concentration of dithiothreitol, which never exceeded 1 mm. After incubation, the medium was aspirated and replaced with 50 mm NaHCO3, pH 8.5, containing protease inhibitors and the cells were harvested and homogenized (detailed in Ref. 31Foran P. Lawrence G. Dolly J.O. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5494-5503Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The homogenate was adjusted to 0.32 msucrose and centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min, and the resultant supernatant was subjected to 390,000 × g for 1 h to sediment all remaining membranes. The resultant pellets were solubilized in 100 mm Tris, pH 6.8, containing 2% (w/v) SDS plus 1 mm EDTA and solubilized by heating to 90 °C for 10 min. Samples were subjected to immunoblotting as detailed in Ref. 21Chen F. Foran P. Shone C.C. Foster K.A. Dolly J.O. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5719-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar. Antibodies bound to the membranes were detected with anti-species-specific Ig conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence, using the ECLTM detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The blots were quantified by densitometric scanning, using image analysis software (National Institutes of Health Image version 1.61), and the resultant values were expressed as a percentage of the toxin-free control. In addition, standard curves of the various amounts of SNARE proteins plotted against band intensity were found to be linear. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were grown on polylysine-coated glass coverslips, and once the adipocyte phenotype was attained (using procedures detailed in Ref. 44Oatey P.B. Van Weering D.H.J. Dobson S.P. Gould G.W. Tavaré J.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 637-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), they were equilibrated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) myoclone plus fetal calf serum, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 2 mmNaHCO3, and microinjected using an Eppendorf semi-automatic system. Plasmids were microinjected at 20–100 μg/ml in the absence or presence of prereduced BoNT/B (2 μm) or BoNT/E (1 μm) in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 μm ZnSO4. It is estimated that approximately 10% of the cell volume is delivered during microinjection, thus providing an intracellular concentration of toxin of 100–200 nm. After microinjection, the cells were incubated at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) myoclone plus fetal calf serum for 16–24 h. Before further manipulation, adipocytes were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and then for 1 h in the presence of 200 nm insulin, as required. In some experiments, the cellular distribution of expressed PKB (which possesses a HA tag) was determined. Cells were fixed and permeabilized, using 4% paraformaldehyde and 1% Triton X-100.

Heparin affects the bioavailability and biological activity of extracellular Tat (Rusnati, M., Coltrini, D., Oreste, P., Zoppetti, G., Albini, A., Noonan, D., D'Adda di Fagagna, F., Giacca, M., and Presta, M. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 11313–11320). Here, a series of homogeneously sized, 3H-labeled heparin fragments were evaluated for their capacity to bind to free glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-Tat protein and to immobilized GST-Tat. Hexasaccharides represent the minimum sized heparin fragments able to interact with GST-Tat at physiological ionic strength. Also, the affinity of binding increases with increasing the molecular size of the oligosaccharides, with large fragments (≥18 saccharides) approaching the affinity of full-size heparin. 6-Mer heparin binds GST-Tat with a dissociation constant (Kd) equal to 0.7 ± 0.4 μm and a molar oligosaccharide:GST-Tat ratio of about 1:1. Interaction of GST-Tat with 22-mer or full-size heparin is consistent instead with two-component binding. At subsaturating concentrations, a single molecule of heparin interacts with 4–6 molecules of GST-Tat with high affinity (Kd values in the nanomolar range of concentration); at saturating concentrations, heparin binds GST-Tat with lower affinity (Kdvalues in the micromolar range of concentration) and a molar oligosaccharide:GST-Tat ratio of about 1:1. In agreement with the binding data, a positive correlation exists between the size of heparin oligosaccharides and their capacity to inhibit cell internalization, long terminal repeat-transactivating activity of extracellular Tat in HL3T1 cells, and its mitogenic activity in murine adenocarcinoma T53 Tat-less cells.The data demonstrate that the modality of heparin-Tat interaction is strongly affected by the size of the saccharide chain. The possibility of establishing multiple interactions increases the affinity of large heparin fragments for Tat protein and the capacity of the glycosaminoglycan to modulate the biological activity of extracellular Tat. Tat protein, a transactivating factor of the human immunodeficiency virus type I, acts also as an extracellular molecule.

On the other hand, free heparin potentiates the mitogenic and chemotactic activity exerted by extracellular Tat in cultured endothelial cells and its angiogenic activity in vivo (13Albini A.

Interestingly, polysulfonated heparin-mimicking compounds can interfere with the biological activity of extracellular Tat and may represent potent inhibitors of possible therapeutic value (19Rusnati M.

The molecular bases of heparin-Tat interaction have been investigated. As observed for various heparin binding growth factors and cytokines (21Lindahl U. Lidholt K. Spillmann D. Kjellen L. Thromb. Res. 1994; 75: 1-32Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 22Spillmann D. Lindahl U. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 677-682Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar), sulfate groups of heparin are of importance for Tat binding. Indeed, high affinity Tat-heparin interaction requires at least some 2-O, 6-O, and N positions to be sulfated (18Rusnati M. Coltrini D. Oreste P. Zoppetti G. Albini A. Noonan D. d'Adda di Fagagna F. Giacca M. Presta M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11313-11320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). These sulfate groups bind to a stretch of positively charged amino acid residues present in the basic domain of the Tat protein (19Rusnati M. Tulipano G. Urbinati C. Tanghetti E. Giuliani R. Giacca M. Ciomei M. Corallini A. Presta M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16027-16037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Also, the size of heparin is of importance in mediating Tat interaction, because very low molecular weight heparin shows a poor capacity to bind and antagonize the biological activity of extracellular Tat when compared with conventional heparin (18Rusnati M. Coltrini D. Oreste P. Zoppetti G. Albini A. Noonan D. d'Adda di Fagagna F. Giacca M. Presta M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11313-11320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The minimum size of the heparin/HS chain required for protein interaction has been identified for different growth factors. For instance, a hexa-octasaccharide represents the minimum size of HS required for the binding to hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) (23Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Mizuno K. Nakamura T. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol.

Salmivitra M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5518-5524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), whereas the minimum binding sequence for fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) has been identify as a pentasaccharide (26Maccarana M. Casu B. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23898-23905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Faham S. Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R. Linhardt R.J. Rees D.C. Science. 1998; 271: 1116-1120Crossref Scopus (734) Google Scholar). In contrast, larger HS fragments (ranging from 18 to 20 saccharide residues) are required for binding to the platelet factor-4 tetramer (28Stringer S.E. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20508-20514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and interleukin-8 dimer (29Spillmann D. Witt D. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15487-15493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The minimum binding sequence of heparin/HS able to interact with the growth factor may be insufficient to promote its biological activity. Indeed, the minimum heparin/HS sequence able to affect the biological activity of FGF-2 is composed of at least 10–12 saccharide residues (30Ornitz D.M. Yayon A. Flanagan J.G. Svahn C.M. Levi E.

Moreover, a correlation exists between the length of the FGF-2-binding oligosaccharides and their capacity to restore FGF-2-induced proliferation in HSPG-deprived endothelial cells (31Ishihara M. Tyrrel D.J. Stauber G.B. Brown S. Cousens L.S. Stack R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4675-4683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The same correlation exists between the size of HGF-binding sulfated oligosaccharides and their capacity to potentiate the mitogenic activity of the growth factor (34Zioncheck T.F. Richardson L.

A possible explanation of these findings is based on the capacity of larger GAG chains to bind several growth factor molecules. For instance, a single molecule of conventional heparin binds up to 10 molecules of FGF-2 (35Coltrini D. Rusnati M. Zoppetti G. Oreste P. Isacchi A. Caccia P. Bergonzoni L. Presta M. Eur. J.

In this present study we investigated the capacity of size-defined, heparin-derived oligosaccharides to bind to Tat protein and to affect the biological activity of extracellular Tat. The results demonstrate that six saccharide residues represent the minimum requirement for Tat interaction. The apparent affinity of binding increases with increasing the molecular size of the heparin chain, with large fragments (≥18 saccharides) approaching the binding capacity and antagonist activity of full-size heparin. Also, depending on its size and relative concentration, one heparin chain can bind up to 4–6 molecules of Tat protein. Even-numbered heparin-derived oligosaccharides were prepared from bovine lung heparin and 3H-labeled as described previously (29Spillmann D. Witt D. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15487-15493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Briefly, the polysaccharides were depolymerized with nitrous acid at pH 1.5. Cleavage products were reduced either by N2BH4 to prepare nonlabeled fragments or by NaB[3H]4 to radiolabel them, and size-separated by gel filtration on Bio-Gel P-10 (29Spillmann D. Witt D. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15487-15493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The specific activity of the radiolabeled fragments reached 1 × 106 dpm/μmol fragment. Recombinant HIV-I Tat was expressed in Escherichia coli as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein. The corresponding plasmid construct derives from pGST-Tat 2E, originally obtained by cloning the coding region of both exons of HIV-IHXB2 Tat in the commercial vector pGEX2T (39Demarchi F. d'Adda di Fagagna F. Falaschi A. Giacca M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4427-4437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This construct codes for the 86-amino acid Tat protein. Recombinant GST-Tat was also fused at its C terminus to the green fluorescent protein (GFP). To this purpose, the enhanced GFP coding region was amplified by polymerase chain reactions from the commercial vector pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) using primers 5′ GTGGAATTCATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGAG and 3′ ATTTCGCCGGCGCTGAGATCTGGGCCCGCG, carrying EcoRI- and SmaI-cleavable sites, respectively. The amplified product was digested with the two restriction enzymes, gel-purified, and ligated in frame to the respective sites in pGST-Tat 2E. Purification of recombinant GST-Tat and GST-Tat-GFP proteins was performed by glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography as described (39Demarchi F. d'Adda di Fagagna F. Falaschi A. Giacca M. J.

The purity (>95%) and integrity of the proteins were routinely checked by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining. Previous studies have shown that the GST and GFP moieties do not interfere with the LTR-transactivating activity of Tat or with its capacity to bind heparin (Ref. 18Rusnati M. Coltrini D. Oreste P.

Recombinant GST-Tat was labeled with 125I (17 Ci/mg, NEN Life Science Products) using Iodogen (Pierce) to a specific radioactivity of 400 cpm/fmol as described previously (19Rusnati M. Tulipano G.

Aliquots (400 μl) of glutathione-agarose beads were mixed with 7 nmol of recombinant GST-Tat. After incubation at 4 °C, beads were extensively washed, resuspended in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl (TBS), and stored at 4 °C until use. Under these conditions, up to 90% of the protein binds to the resin. The capacity of full-size heparin and oligosaccharides to bind to immobilized Tat was evaluated as described previously (19Rusnati M. Tulipano G. Urbinati C. Tanghetti E. Giuliani R. Giacca M.

Briefly, 110 pmol of3H-labeled saccharides were loaded onto 80-μl columns containing 1.3 nmol of GST-Tat protein and allowed to recycle inside the column for 15 min at 4 °C at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min by means of a peristaltic minipump. Preliminary experiments had shown that 15 min of recycling were sufficient to reach equilibrium for the binding of 3M. Rusnati, unpublished observations. H-labeled saccharide to immobilized Tat.3 Then, the column was extensively washed with TBS, and bound radioactivity was eluted in a single step with a 2.0 m NaCl wash, or it was eluted stepwise with increasing concentrations of NaCl, all in TBS. Radioactivity in the different fractions was measured in a liquid scintillation counter. To evaluate the dissociation constant (Kd) of the interaction of GST-Tat with full-size and 22- and 6-mer heparin, the column was loaded with increasing concentrations of the 3H-labeled saccharides that were allowed to reach equilibrium with immobilized Tat as described above. Bound radioactivity was eluted with a 2.0 m NaCl wash, and binding data were then analyzed according to the procedure originally described by Scatchard (41Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17789) Google Scholar). To evaluate the capacity of 3H-labeled heparin oligosaccharides to interact with GST-Tat in solution, the method described by Maccarana et al. (26Maccarana M. Casu B. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23898-23905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used with minor modifications. Aliquots of GST-Tat were incubated for 20 min at room temperature with different amounts of 3H-labeled heparin oligosaccharides in a final volume of 200 μl in TBS. Samples were then filtered through 25-mm filters (Polyscreen polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, NEN Life Science Products) equilibrated with TBS and placed onto a Sartorius filtration apparatus. Filters were washed twice with 5 ml of TBS, and retained radioactivity was eluted by washing the filter with 2 ml of 2.0 m NaCl in TBS. The eluate was mixed to 2 ml of water and 16 ml of Ready Safe liquid scintillation mixture (Beckman) and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Control experiments performed using 125I-GST-Tat as a tracer demonstrated that this procedure allows the recovery of up to 97% of the protein both in the absence or presence of heparin. HL3T1 cells are derived from HeLa cells and contain integrated copies of pL3CAT, a plasmid in which the bacterial gene for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) is directed by the HIV-I LTR (42Wright C.M. Selber B.K. Paskalis H. Pavlakis G.N. Science. 1986; 234: 988-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). T53 Tat-less cells were obtained by subcloning the T53 cell line originally established from adenocarcinoma of skin adnexa of Tat-transgenic mice (9Corallini A. Campioni D. Rossi C. Albini A.

Dot blot analysis of the conditioned medium of T53 Tat-less cells performed with anti-Tat antibodies revealed that this clone does not produce detectable amounts of extracellular Tat when compared with parental T53 cells (data not shown). Nevertheless, T53 Tat-less cells retain the capacity to proliferate when exposed to extracellular Tat (see below). All cells were grown and maintained in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cell internalization of GST-Tat was studied by using radiolabeled 125I-GST-Tat and fluorescent GST-Tat-GFP. In the first set of experiments, HL3T1 cells were seeded in 24-well dishes at the density of 45,000 cells/cm2 in DMEM containing 10% FCS. After 24 h, cell cultures were washed twice with TBS and incubated in binding medium (serum-free medium containing 0.15% gelatin and 20 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.5) complemented with 20 ng/ml of125I-GST-Tat plus 200 ng/ml of unlabeled GST-Tat as a carrier in the absence or presence of the different oligosaccharides. 100 μm chloroquine was added to cell cultures to prevent lysosomal degradation of cell-internalized Tat. After 16 h at 37 °C, the cells were washed three times with cold TBS and lysed by incubation with 0.5% Triton X-100 in 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 8.1. Radioactivity of the cell lysates was measured, and nonspecific binding, determined in the presence of a 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled GST-Tat (4 μg/ml), was subtracted. Under these experimental conditions, up to 90% of the radioactivity remains associated to the cell after a wash with 2.0 m NaCl in sodium acetate, pH 4.0 (45Moscatelli D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 753-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), thus demonstrating the intracellular localization of cell-associated 125I. In a second set of experiments, glass coverslips (10 mm in diameter) were immersed in 65% HNO3 for 1 h, washed with distilled water, immersed in 7% NaOH for one more hour, washed with distilled water again, and dried. Coverslips were then placed within 24-well tissue culture plates, and HL3T1 cells were seeded at 20,000 cells/cm2 and allowed to adhere onto glass coverslips. Adherent cells were then incubated for 6 h at 37 °C in DMEM containing 10% FCS in the presence of 400 ng/ml of GST-Tat-GFP in the absence or presence of the different oligosaccharides. 100 μm chloroquine was added to cell cultures to prevent lysosomal degradation of internalized Tat. At the end of incubation, the excess of GST-Tat-GFP was removed, and cell cultures were washed twice with 2.0 m NaCl in phosphate-buffered saline to remove GST-Tat-GFP adsorbed onto the cell surface. Then cells were fixed by a 5-min incubation with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% sucrose. Observations were carried out under a Nikon photomicroscope equipped for epifluorescence. HL3T1 cells were seeded in 24-well dishes at the density of 20,000 cells/cm2in DMEM containing 10% FCS. After 24 h, cell cultures were washed twice with TBS and incubated for another 24 h in fresh medium containing 10% FCS and 100 μm chloroquine in the absence or presence of recombinant GST-Tat (200 ng/ml) and of increasing concentrations of the oligosaccharide under test. After 24 h the medium was changed to DMEM with 10% FCS, and cells were incubated for another 24 h. At the end of the incubation, cells were extracted and the amount of CAT protein present in the cell extracts was determined by the CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. T53 Tat-less cells were seeded in 96-well dishes at 15,000 cells/cm2 in DMEM containing 10% FCS. After 24 h, subconfluent cultures were washed twice with DMEM and treated with fresh medium containing 10% FCS and 100 ng/ml of GST-Tat in the absence or presence of different heparin-derived oligosaccharides or full-length heparin. After 24 h of incubation at 37 °C, cells were trypsinized and counted in a Burker chamber. To identify the minimum size of heparin required for Tat interaction, heparin-derived 3H-labeled oligosaccharides of defined size were evaluated for their capacity to bind to GST-Tat immobilized onto glutathione-agarose beads. This experimental model had already been used to characterize the binding of Tat to heparin and different polysulfated/polysulfonated compounds (18Rusnati M. Coltrini D. Oreste P. Zoppetti G.

In mammalian genes encoding this receptor, exons M6/7 and M7 are highly conserved and separated by 81–84 intronic nucleotides. Genomic polymerase chain reaction using degenerate primers based on these exons led to two distinct DNA fragments comprising portions of genes encoding the zPTH1R and the novel zPTH3R. Sequence comparison of both full-length teleost receptors revealed 69% similarity (61% identity), but less homology with zPTH2R. When compared with hPTH1R, zPTH1R showed 76% and zPTH3R 67% amino acid sequence similarity; similarity with hPTH2R was only 59% for both teleost receptors. When expressed in COS-7 cells, zPTH1R bound [Tyr34]hPTH-(1–34)-amide (hPTH), [Tyr36]hPTHrP-(1–36)-amide (hPTHrP), and [Ala29,Glu30,Ala34,Glu35, Tyr36]fugufish PTHrP-(1–36)-amide (fuguPTHrP) with a high apparent affinity (IC50: 1.2–3.5 nm), and was efficiently activated by all three peptides (EC50: 1.1–1.7 nm). In contrast, zPTH3R showed higher affinity for fuguPTHrP and hPTHrP (IC50: 2.1–11.1 nm) than for hPTH (IC50: 118.2–127.0 nm); cAMP accumulation was more efficiently stimulated by fugufish and human PTHrP (EC50: 0.47 ± 0.27 and 0.45 ± 0.16, respectively) than by hPTH (EC50: 9.95 ± 1.5 nm).

Although these findings suggested the presence of a distinct subfamily of PTH and/or PTHrP receptors, only one novel cDNA encoding the PTH2 receptor (PTH2R) has been isolated thus far (12Usdin T.B.

To explore the molecular evolution of PTH receptors, we previously isolated DNAs encoding frog PTH1Rs (15Bergwitz C. Klein P. Kohno H. Forman S.A. Lee K. Rubin D. Jüppner H.

To extend these studies, we now isolated DNAs that encode the zebrafish homolog of the mammalian PTH1R and that of a novel, type 3 receptor (PTH3R). As with the hPTH1R, human PTH (hPTH), fugufish PTHrP (fuguPTHrP), and human PTHrP (hPTHrP) stimulated cAMP accumulation in cells expressing the zebrafish PTH1R (zPTH1R). In contrast, the zebrafish PTH3R (zPTH3R) was preferentially activated by fuguPTHrP and hPTHrP, and less efficiently by hPTH. Furthermore, only the zPTH1R, but not the zPTH3R, showed activation of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate pathway. We thank Drs. Ernestina Schipani, Kenneth B. Jonsson, Thomas J. Gardella, Henry T.

The atomic imaging capabilities of the scanning tunneling microscope were used to directly visualize the interaction between charge density oscillations and lattice defects in a two-dimensional charge density wave (CDW) system. Point defects act as nucleation centers of the CDW, which, as the temperature is lowered, results in the formation of pinned CDW domains that are separated by atomically abrupt charge boundaries. Incomplete freezing of substitutional disorder at low temperature indicates a novel CDW-mediated hopping of pinning centers."

The xenon isotopic data indicate the presence of a solarlike component deep within Earth. The presence of this component in crustal and upper mantle reservoirs may be explained by a steady-state transport of noble gases from the lower mantle, which still retains much of its juvenile volatile inventory. These measurements also indicate that the mantle source of these noble gases in the carbon dioxide well gases cannot be the source of Earth's present atmosphere. The variations observed in (129)Xe/(130)Xe between solar wind xenon, Earth's atmosphere, and mantle samples may be generated by variations of iodine/xenon in terrestrial reservoirs, as opposed to rapid early degassing."
https://openalex.org/W2059347808,"The yeast genome contains two genes, designated as PLB2 and PLB3, that are 67% and 62% identical, respectively, to PLB1, which codes for a phospholipase B/lysophospholipase in yeast (Lee, S. K., Patton, J. L., Fido, M., Hines, L. K., Kohlwein, S. D., Paltauf, F., Henry, S. A., and Levin, D. E. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 19725–19730). Deletion and overexpression studies andin vivo and in vitro activity measurements suggest that both genes indeed code for phospholipases B/lysophospholipases. In cell free extracts of a plb1 plb2 plb3 triple mutant, no phospholipase B activity was detectable. Upon overexpression of PLB2 in a plb1 plb3mutant background, phospholipase B activity was detectable in the plasma membrane, periplasmic space extracts and the culture supernatant. Similar to Plb1p, Plb2p appears to accept all major phospholipid classes, with a preference for acidic phospholipids including phosphatidylinositol 3′,4′-bisphosphate and phosphatidic acid. Consistent with a function as an extracellular lysophospholipase,PLB2 overexpression conferred resistance to lyso-phosphatidylcholine. Deletion of Plb2p function had no effect on glycerophosphoinositol or glycerophosphocholine releasein vivo, in contrast to a deletion of Plb3p function, which resulted in a 50% reduction of phosphatidylinositol breakdown and glycerophosphoinositol release from the cells. In vitro, Plb3p hydrolyzes only phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylserine and, to a lesser extent, their lyso-analogs. Plb3p activity in a plb1 plb2 mutant background was observed in periplasmic space extracts.

Phospholipases B catalyze the hydrolytic cleavage of both acylester bonds of glycerophospholipids. Products of phospholipase B activity are fatty acids and water-soluble glycerophosphodiesters. In yeast, soluble degradation products are released to some extent into the culture medium, and are thus an indicator of cellular phospholipase B activity. The only acylester-hydrolyzing enzyme from yeast characterized so far at the molecular level is a phospholipase B encoded by the PLB1 gene (1Lee S.K. Patton J.L. Fido M. Hines L.K. Kohlwein S.D.

The highly glycosylated enzyme of about 220 kDa (73 kDa for the protein part, predicted from the sequence) is enriched in the yeast plasma membrane but was also found in the periplasmic space and in the culture supernatant. The lysophospholipase activity of Plb1p greatly exceeds the activity catalyzing the first step of hydrolysis; thus, lyso-phospholipids do not accumulate as intermediate products of Plb1p activity (2Witt W.

The physiological function of yeast phospholipase B is still unclear; neither disruption of thePLB1 gene nor its overexpression result in detectable growth phenotypes. However, the amount of glycerophosphocholine (GroPCho) and glycerophosphoethanolamine released into the culture supernatant by aplb1 deletion mutant is greatly reduced compared with wild type. In contrast, release of glycerophosphoinositol (GroPIns) is hardly affected in this strain, suggesting that Plb1p is mainly responsible for the deacylation of PtdCho and phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn), but not phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns). Thus, additional enzyme(s) must exist which catalyze deacylation of PtdIns (1Lee S.K. Patton J.L. Fido M. Hines L.K. Kohlwein S.D. Paltauf F. Henry S.A. Levin D.E. J. Biol.

Here we report on the cloning and molecular characterization of these genes, designated as PLB2 and PLB3, and the characterization of enzyme activities in vivo and in vitro resulting from deletion or overexpression of these genes. Yeast strains used in this study (Table I) were derivatives of W303 (R. Rothstein). Cultures were grown on YEPD medium (1% yeast extract (Difco), 2% peptone (Difco), 2% glucose). Synthetic minimal medium (7Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B.N. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar) supplemented with the appropriate nutrients was used for plasmid maintenance. YEPD media plates supplemented with 0.01% Geneticin (G418, Fluka) were used for selection of transformants in gene displacement experiments (8Wach A. Brachat A. Pöhlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 13: 1793-1808Crossref Scopus (2237) Google Scholar). For growth inhibition studies, YEPD media were supplemented with up to 50 μg/ml lyso-PtdCho and cells were incubated for 18 h. Culture media used for measuring the release of glycerophosphoinositol and glycerophosphocholine in vivo(5Patton J.L. Pessoa-Brandao L. Henry S. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 177: 3379-3385Crossref Google Scholar) were supplemented with 100 μm each of choline, glycerophosphocholine, inositol, and glycerophosphoinositol. For anaerobic growth tests, yeast strains were precultivated overnight in synthetic minimal medium (7Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B.N. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual.

Cells were resuspended in sterile water to an optical density of 11. A 3-μl aliquot of cell suspension and of 10−2, 10−3, and 10−4 dilutions, respectively, were dropped onto agar plates containing Brij 58 (1%), Ergosterol (0.002%), and either Tween 80 (0.5%) or palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (0.12%).

Genetic manipulation, yeast DNA isolation, and DNA sequencing were carried out as described (10Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman J. Smith J. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates/Wiley-Interscience, New York1990Google Scholar). Computational sequence analysis was performed using PILEUP from EGCG Wisconsin package version 8.1.0 (1996), Saccharomyces Genome Database, Yeast Proteome Database, and the most recent data bases from GenBank and SwissProt available via the World Wide Web. The open reading frameYMR006c, designated PLB2, was replaced by thekanMX4 gene in a PCR-based gene disruption experiment using the long flanking sequence homology protocol (8Wach A. Brachat A. Pöhlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 13: 1793-1808Crossref Scopus (2237) Google Scholar). The following sets of primers were used: P5′ (5′-GTGTGCCTTCAAATCTTATCAAG-3′) and the hybrid primer P5′L (5′-GGGGATCCGTCGACCTGCAGCGTACAACCAATCAGTTTCAGCGG-3′) to amplify a 254-bp fragment at the 5′ region of PLB2(-78 to +176), and P3′ (5′-CGGAAAGAGGAGTGATAATCG-3′) and the hybrid primer P3′L (5′-AACGAGCTCGAATTCATCGATGATACGACTTCATCAAATGTCACTTC-3′) to amplify a 329-bp fragment at the 3′ end of PLB2(from +1913 to 120 bp downstream of the stop codon). Yeast genomic DNA was used as template for the PCR reactions (Ex Taqpolymerase, TaKaRa). The fragments were used as primers for a second PCR, to amplify the kanMX4-disruption cassette (2092 bp length) with vector pFA6a-kanMX (8Wach A. Brachat A. Pöhlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 13: 1793-1808Crossref Scopus (2237) Google Scholar) as template. PCR products were transformed into yeast (see below). The open reading frameYOL011w, designated PLB3, was replaced by thekanMX4 gene in analogy to the PLB2 disruption described above. The following sets of primers were used: P5′ (5′-TAAGATGGCTTGGCTATGG-3′) and the hybrid primer P5′L (5′-GGGGATCCGTCGACCTGCAGCGTACGACTTTATTCCTCTTTTCCAACC-3′ to amplify 434 bp of the 5′ region of PLB3 (−233 to +201) and P3′ (5′-GTGTAGTTCTTTGATTTTTATTGCC-3′) and the hybrid primer P3′L (5′-AACGAGCTCGAATTCATCGATGATAGGATACTACCCCATTACCAGATG-3′) to amplify 346 bp of the 3′ end of PLB3 (from +1773 to 57 bp downstream of the stop codon). Yeast genomic DNA was used as template for the PCR reaction, and the obtained fragments were used as primers for a second PCR to amplify the kanMX4-disruption cassette (2289 bp length). PCR products were transformed into yeast (see below). Diploid wild type and a heterozygousplb1::URA3/PLB1 mutant strain were transformed with the PCR products and selected for growth on media plates containing Geneticin (8Wach A. Brachat A. Pöhlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 13: 1793-1808Crossref Scopus (2237) Google Scholar). Resistant colonies were restreaked and incubated for 3 days. Correct integration of the disruption cassettes was confirmed by colony PCR (11Zon L.I. Dorfman D.M. Orkin S.H. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 696-698PubMed Google Scholar). Diploid transformants were sporulated, and haploid progeny were tested for Geneticin resistance, growth phenotypes, mating type, and mating efficiency. For the construction of double and triple mutants, haploidplb2 and plb3 mutant cells of opposite mating type were mated and sporulated, and haploid progeny were tested for Geneticin resistance. Tetrads of non-parental ditype with respect toplb2 and plb3 mutations/Geneticin resistance were selected, and double disruption was confirmed by colony PCR. Similarly, a plb1::URA3 plb2::kanMX4 plb3::kanMX4 triple mutant was constructed. The PLB2 gene including 429 bp upstream of the putative translation start site and 492 bp downstream of the stop codon was amplified by PCR from total yeast genomic DNA using the following set of primers: primer A (5′-CCTCTAGAGAATTTACCGTCGCACCAAT-3′) and primer B (5′-CCTCTAGAGGAGAAAGTGGGCTAAAGTT-3′). Use of these primers introduces an XbaI restriction site (underlined). The 3049-bp PCR product was purified using a PCR purification kit (Qiagen), cut with XbaI, and ligated into the XbaI site of plasmid YEp351, which harbors the LEU2 marker for selection in yeast (13Hawkins P.T. Stephens L.R. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 1986; 238: 507-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Sequence of the PCR-cloned PLB2 gene was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The PLB3 gene, including 908 bp upstream of the putative translation start site and 211 bp downstream of the stop codon, was amplified by PCR from total yeast genomic DNA using the following set of primers: primer A (5′-GTTCTAGACATATTGATTGCGGGTAACAC-3′) and primer B (5′-GTTCTAGACCTCCGATGTCATTAGTGAAG-3′). The PCR product (3189 bp) was purified, cut with XbaI, and ligated into the XbaI site of plasmid YEp351 (12Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1993; 2: 163-167Crossref Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). Sequence of the PCR-cloned PLB3 gene was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Synthetic medium (2% glucose) supplemented with 100 μm choline and 100 μm inositol (5Patton J.L. Pessoa-Brandao L. Henry S. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 177: 3379-3385Crossref Google Scholar) was inoculated with cells from overnight cultures and incubated for 1 h. 20 μCi of [methyl- 14C]choline chloride (20 μCi; 54 mCi/mmol) and 10 μCi of myo-[2-3H]inositol (20 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) were added, and incubation was continued for 14 h to achieve steady-state labeling of PtdCho and PtdIns. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with sterile distilled water, and recultured at the original OD600 in fresh medium supplemented with unlabeled 100 μm each of choline, inositol, GroPCho, and GroPIns. Addition of unlabeled lipid degradation products to the culture medium quenches immediate reutilization of label released from the cells. Aliquots of culture were removed at time zero, and after 6 h, cells were spun down and radioactivity in the culture medium was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The secretion products inositol, inositol phosphate, and GroPIns were separated by anion exchange chromatography (AG1-X2, mesh 200–400; Bio-Rad) as described by Hawkins et al. (13Hawkins P.T. Stephens L.R. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 1986; 238: 507-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). GroPCho was separated from choline and choline phosphate by cation exchange chromatography (Dowex 50 WX 8, mesh 200–400; Serva) as described by Cook et al. (14Cook S.R. Wakelam J.O. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Plasma membrane was prepared as described by Serrano (15Serrano R. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The method involves cell disruption by shaking with glass beads, followed by differential centrifugation. The published method was slightly modified, using a single three-step sucrose gradient (45%, 50%, and 60%) for centrifugation at 25,000 rpm for 2 h in an SW28 rotor (Sorvall OTD2). The membrane fraction floating on top of 60% sucrose was collected and used as enzyme source for phospholipase B activity measurements. Cells were grown in choline- and inositol-free media to early logarithmic phase (OD600 of 3). Cells were harvested and washed once with ice-cold water and buffer A (1.2 m sorbitol, 10 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4). Cells were resuspended in buffer A containing 3 mg/ml zymolyase 20T (Seikagaku) to a density of 0.3 g of wet cells/ml and incubated under gentle agitation for 30 min at 30 °C. Cell wall digestion was monitored by microscopy. Spheroplasts were removed by centrifugation (GSA rotor, 700 × g, 20 min), and the supernatant was collected for enzyme activity measurements. Radioactively labeled phospholipids were prepared biosynthetically by incubating yeast cells with [1-14C]palmitic acid (NEN Life Science Products) for 2 h, followed by extraction of lipids and isolation of phospholipid classes by thin-layer chromatography (16Wagner S. Paltauf F. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1429-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Purity was typically >95%, as checked by TLC. Radioactively labeled lyso-phospholipids were prepared from [1-14C]palmitate-labeled phospholipids by hydrolysis with phospholipase A2 from Naja naja (Sigma) and TLC separation (16Wagner S. Paltauf F. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1429-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Phospholipid/Triton X-100 mixed micelles were prepared by combining phospholipid and detergent dissolved in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), evaporation of the solvent under a stream of nitrogen, and subsequent dispersion in water (17Gheriani-Gruszka N. Almog S. Biltonen R.L. Lichtenberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11808-11813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzyme activity was determined in an assay system containing 50 mm glycine/HCl, pH 3.5, or 50 mm citrate buffer, pH 5.5, radioactively labeled phospholipids with a specific radioactivity of about 0.4 mCi/mol, and, if not indicated otherwise, periplasmic space extracts equivalent to 13 mg of wet cells as the enzyme source, in a total assay volume of 100 μl. Substrate was added in the form of phospholipid/Triton X-100 mixed micelles at ratios specified in the respective figures and tables. Concentration of Ca2+ was as indicated in the figure legends. The reactions were started by the addition of substrate, and incubation was continued at 30 °C for 10 min, which is in the linear range of the reaction. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 4 volumes of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). For complete extraction of lyso-PtdIns, the reaction mixture was acidified with 3 μl of 1 n HCl. Aliquots of the organic phase were applied to TLC plates, and lipids were separated with chloroform/methanol/6% ammonia (60:40:5, v/v/v) as the developing solvent. Radioactivity of individual lipids was quantified using an automatic TLC linear analyzer (Tracemaster 20, Berthold), or by liquid scintillation counting. Km andvmax values were determined by non linear regression to the Michaelis-Menten function using the computer program SigmaPlot 4.0.1. Lipids were extracted from cells after homogenization with glass beads in a Braun cell homogenizer (Braun, Melsungen, Germany), with chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), as described (18Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Individual phospholipid classes were separated by two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography on Silica gel 60 plates (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) using chloroform/methanol/25% ammonia (65:35:5, v/v/v) as first, and chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (50:20:10:10:5, v/v/v) as the second developing solvent and quantified by the method of Broekhuyse (19Broekhuyse R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 152: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Triacylglycerols were quantified densitometrically after thin layer chromatography separation using petrolether/diethylether/acetic acid (70:30:2, v/v/v) as developing solvent followed by dipping plates for 5 s into 0.6m H2SO4, 25 mmMnCl2 in H2O/methanol (1:1, v/v) and heating at 100 °C for 30 min. Densitometry was carried out with the dual-wavelength Chromato scanner CS-930 (Shimadzu). Protein was quantified by the method of Lowry et al.(20Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. The yeast genome contains two genes, designated as PLB2 and PLB3, with high homologies to PLB1 that was previously shown to code for a phospholipase B/lysophospholipase in yeast (1Lee S.K. Patton J.L. Fido M. Hines L.K. Kohlwein S.D. Paltauf F. Henry S.A. Levin D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19725-19730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).PLB2 is located 1 kilobase pair downstream ofPLB1 on chromosome XIII and is 66.8% identical at the DNA level and 73.5% identical at the protein level to Plb1p (Fig.1). PLB2 codes for a 706-amino acid protein of 75.4 kDa. Several putative N- andO-glycosylation sites are present. In contrast to Plb1p (1Lee S.K. Patton J.L. Fido M. Hines L.K. Kohlwein S.D. Paltauf F. Henry S.A. Levin D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19725-19730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Plb3p (see below), the protein encoded by PLB2does not appear to contain a cleavable N-terminal signal sequence nor does the C terminus contain the typical motifs for GPI anchor attachment (21von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3693) Google Scholar, 22Udenfriend S. Kodukula K.

Baba M. Kitada K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 258: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The PLB3 gene, located on chromosome XV, is 62.0% identical to PLB1 at the DNA level and 73.4% identical at the protein level (Fig. 1). Plb2p and Plb3p are 66.0% identical. ThePLB3 gene codes for a 686-amino acid protein of 75.0 kDa. The N and C termini harbor stretches of 18 and 16 hydrophobic amino acids, respectively, indicative of membrane spanning domains (Fig. 1). The N terminus may contain a cleavable signal sequence, with a predicted cleavage site between amino acids 26 and 27 (21von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3693) Google Scholar). Adjacent to the C-terminal TM domain a motif for GPI anchor attachment on Asn-659, similar to Plb1p, is present (Fig. 1), (22Udenfriend S. Kodukula K. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 571-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). PSORTII (23Horton P. Nakai K. Intellig. Syst. Mol. Biol. 1996; 4: 109-115PubMed Google Scholar) predicts a high probability for a localization of Plb3p in the plasma membrane and in the extracellular space, similar to Plb1p, which is consistent with findings of Hamada et al. (24Hamada K. Fukuchi S. Arisawa M. Baba M. Kitada K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 258: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), who provided experimental evidence that Plb3p is localized in the extracellular space. Plb2p is predicted to localize to the extracellular space as well, and with a low probability to mitochondria. Homology of PLB2 and PLB3 extends not only toSaccharomyces cerevisiae PLB1 (67% and 62%, respectively) but to structural genes coding for phospholipases B inSchizosaccharomyces pombe (29% and 30%; GenBank accession no. AB005603), Penicillium notatum (43% and 45%; see Ref.25Masuda N. Kitamura N. Saito K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 783-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), Candida albicans (51% and 52%; see Ref. 26Ghannoum M.A. Nippon Ishinkin Gakkai Zasshi. 1998; 39: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), andTorulaspora delbrueckii (63% and 53%; see Ref. 27Watanabe Y. Yashiki Y. Sultana G.N. Maruyama M. Kangawa K. Tamai Y. FEMS Microbiol Lett. 1994; 124: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The high homology to established phospholipase B encoding genes further suggests that PLB2 and PLB3 are indeed structural genes coding for phospholipases B/lysophospholipases in S. cerevisiae. In order to further characterize the PLB2 and PLB3 genes and to verify their role as structural genes for phospholipases, deletion mutants and strains overexpressing the respective genes were constructed. plb2 mutants and plb1 plb2 double mutants grew at slightly reduced rates compared with wild type cells on complete YEPD media, whereas plb3 mutants and plb1 plb3 double mutants and a plb1 plb2 plb3 triple mutant grew at wild type rates on fermentable and non-fermentable carbon sources, at temperatures between 25 °C and 37 °C. Sporulation efficiencies of heterozygous diploid plb2/PLB2 andplb3/PLB3, and homozygous diploid plb2/plb2 orplb3/plb3 mutants were comparable to wild type; sporulation and mating efficiency were also not affected by any of the double or triple mutations. Overexpression of PLB2 or PLB3from a high copy number plasmid had no apparent effect on cellular growth under the conditions tested. Upon incubation of cells in water overexpression of PLB2 and PLB1, but not ofPLB3, resulted in accelerated cell death; after 1 week of incubation of PLB2- or PLB1-overexpressing strains in distilled water, only 30% of the cells survived, whereas no loss of viability was observed with WT andPLB3-overexpressing strains under these conditions. The ether analog of lyso-phosphatidylcholine, 1-O-hexadecyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, is toxic to wild type yeast cells (28Ruetz S. Brault M. Dalton W. Gros P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8180-8188Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We assumed that lyso-PtdCho might be equally toxic unless it was effectively metabolized prior to exerting its toxic effects, e.g. by an extracellular lysophospholipase. Thus, we tested the effect of deletion and overexpression of PLB2 and PLB3 on lyso-PtdCho toxicity. plb2 mutants were more sensitive than the wild type strain and growth of a plb1 plb2 plb3 triple mutant was essentially abolished at 10 μg/ml lyso-PtdCho in the growth medium. Overexpression of PLB2 increased resistance against lyso-PtdCho but not against the non-hydrolyzable ether analog (Edelfosine; data not shown), suggesting that the protective function of Plb2p results from its lysophospholipase activity (Fig.2; see also in vitroexperiments shown below, Table III). Sensitivity of cells toward lyso-PtdCho was not affected by either deletion or overexpression ofPLB3, consistent with the inability of Plb3p to hydrolyze lyso-PtdCho (Table III, see below).Table IIIKinetic analysis of phospholipase B activity in the periplasm from strains overproducing PLB1 (MF31), PLB2 (MF28), or PLB3 (MF29) at pH 3.5Substratekeff × 103PLB1PLB2PLB3liters/min/g (cww)acww, cell wet weight.PtdSer118 ± 2218 ± 20.046 ± 6PtdIns34 ± 38 ± 10.014 ± 5PtdCho0.2 ± 0.031.5 ± 0.3NDcND, not detectable.PtdEtn0.075 ± 0.010.2 ± 0.03NDLyso-PtdCho—b—, not determined.101 ± 18NDFrom experiments depicted in Fig. 4 A, Kmand vmax values were obtained by nonlinear regression analysis.

To compare the preferences of the phospholipases B for the respective phospholipid, the catalytic efficiency (keff) was determined (keff =vmax/Km). When yeast cells are grown under anaerobic conditions, they are dependent on an external source of ergosterol and unsaturated fatty acids. When the sole source of fatty acid in the growth medium is phosphatidylcholine, external phospholipases B could play a role in phospholipid digestion. On media containing Tween 80, which provides a source of unsaturated fatty acids, wild type and a plbtriple disruption strain (MF17) grew at the same rate (Fig.3 A). In contrast and consistent with a function of phospholipase B in extracellular phospholipid breakdown, growth of a plb triple disruption strain on a medium containing palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine as the only source for unsaturated fatty acids under anaerobic conditions was severely impaired compared with wild type cells (Fig. 3 B). The total cellular phospholipid content of plb1 plb2 plb3 triple mutant cells was significantly increased (3.6 ± 0.3% of cell dry weight) as compared with wild type cells (2.6 ± 0.2% of cell dry weight); however, their"
https://openalex.org/W2067827070,"The bioenergetics of brown fat mitochondria isolated from UCP1-ablated mice were investigated. The mitochondria had lost the high GDP-binding capacity normally found in brown fat mitochondria, and they were innately in an energized state, in contrast to wild-type mitochondria. GDP, which led to energization of wild-type mitochondria, was without effect on the brown fat mitochondria from UCP1-ablated mice. The absence of thermogenic function did not result in reintroduction of high ATP synthase activity. Remarkably and unexpectedly, the mitochondria from UCP1-ablated mice were as sensitive to the de-energizing (“uncoupling”) effect of free fatty acids as were UCP1-containing mitochondria. Therefore, the de-energizing effect of free fatty acids does not appear to be mediated via UCP1, and free fatty acids would not seem to be the intracellular physiological activator involved in mediation of the thermogenic signal from the adrenergic receptor to UCP1. In the UCP1-ablated mice, Ucp2mRNA levels in brown adipose tissue were 14-fold higher andUcp3 mRNA levels were marginally lower than in wild-type. The Ucp2 and Ucp3 mRNA levels were therefore among the highest found in any tissue. These high mRNA levels did not confer on the isolated mitochondria any properties associated with de-energization. Thus, the mere observation of a high level of Ucp2 or Ucp3 mRNA in a tissue cannot be taken as an indication that mitochondria isolated from that tissue will display innate de-energization or thermogenesis.

The thermogenic function of brown adipose tissue is generally believed to result from the expression in the mitochondria of this tissue of the uncoupling protein, UCP1 (for reviews, see Refs. 1Klaus S.

However, until now, analysis of the functional significance of UCP1 has had to be indirect, and there has been no way to identify the properties of brown fat mitochondria that are directly due to the presence of UCP1. Only through the recent development of UCP1-ablated mice in Leslie P. Kozak's laboratory (6Enerbäck S. Jacobsson A. Simpson E.M. Guerra C. Yamashita H. Harper M.-E. Kozak L.P. Nature. 1997; 387: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar) have investigations dedicated to this issue, which is central not only in thermoregulatory research, but also in obesity research, become possible. We present here a study examining the bioenergetics of brown fat mitochondria from UCP1-ablated mice, enabling a delineation of UCP1 function in its native environment and a distinction between UCP1-related and non-UCP1-related properties of brown fat mitochondria (meeting reports of studies of these mitochondria have been published previously (Refs. 7Monemdjou S. Kozak L.P. Harper M.-E. Obesity Res. 1997; 5: 26SGoogle Scholar, 8Matthias A. Jacobsson A. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. EBEC Short Rep. 1998; 10 (155): 155Google Scholar, 9Cannon B. Matthias A.

Physiol. 1999; 276: E1073-E1082PubMed Google Scholar). In most respects, ablation of UCP1 altered the characteristics of the mitochondria in ways predicted from earlier studies of wild-type brown fat mitochondria or from studies of UCP1 ectopically expressed in yeast or reconstituted into liposomes; there were, however, notable exceptions. Most remarkably, we observed that the ability of free fatty acids to (re)induce de-energization (uncoupling) in brown fat mitochondria, generally thought to result from an activation of UCP1, was notUCP1-dependent. Additionally, as brown adipose tissue from UCP1-ablated mice exhibit high expression levels of Ucp2 and Ucp3, the present study allowed for observations of the bioenergetic consequences in isolated mitochondria of such high expression levels. The results indicate that a high expression level of these members of the uncoupling protein family is not intrinsically associated with the corresponding isolated mitochondria being in a de-energized state. The UCP1-ablated mice were progeny of those described by Enerbäck et al. (6Enerbäck S. Jacobsson A. Simpson E.M. Guerra C. Yamashita H. Harper M.-E. Kozak L.P. Nature. 1997; 387: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar), in which UCP1 was inactivated by homologous recombination with a deletion vector in which exon 2 and parts of exon 3 had been replaced with a neomycin resistance gene; in the brown fat of these mice, no UCP1 can be detected with polyclonal antibodies (6Enerbäck S. Jacobsson A. Simpson E.M. Guerra C. Yamashita H. Harper M.-E. Kozak L.P. Nature. 1997; 387: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). The mice were bred within the institute and were phenotypically (hair color, body weight, growth rate, etc.) identical to mice of the C57BL/6 strain that were the donors of the blastocysts (genetically they are infiltrated with 129/SvJ (from the embryonic stem cells) and 129/SvPas (to which the chimeras were bred)). The wild-type mice were thus of the C57BL/6 strain; these mice (of the same age) were obtained from B & K Universal, Stockholm, Sweden. Before the experiments, adult male mice of either strain were acclimated (one per cage) to 24 °C (12 h light, 12 h dark) for 3 weeks with free access to food and water. Brown adipose tissue and liver (and other tissues, to be detailed elsewhere) were rapidly dissected out and pieces thereof frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use. Total RNA was isolated in 1.2 ml of Ultraspec (Biotecx), as described in the manufacturer's protocol. The RNA was separated on an agarose gel (1.25%) containing 20 mm MOPS 1The abbreviations used are:MOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidFCCPcarbonyl cyanidep-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone (pH 7.0), 6.7% formaldehyde, 50 mm NaOAc, and 10 mm EDTA. Ethidium bromide (0.075 μg/ml) was added to the gel for routine examination under UV light of RNA distribution and equal loading. The RNA was transferred to a Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by capillary blotting overnight. The membrane was prehybridized at 42 °C for 2 h in 10 ml/membrane of prehybridizing solution (5× SSC (pH 7.0), 5× Denhardt's, 0.5% SDS, 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.5), 50% formamide, and 100 μg/ml herring sperm DNA (Sigma)). The membranes were then hybridized overnight at 42 °C in the same solution with the addition of [32P]CTP-labeled cDNA, labeled by random priming (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The cDNA clone corresponding to theUcp1 mRNA was that earlier characterized (10Jacobsson A. Stadler U. Glotzer M.A. Kozak L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 16250-16254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA clones corresponding to the Ucp2 andUcp3 mRNAs were obtained from Genome Systems Inc. as EST clones 1040737 and 482847, respectively. The identity of these clones was confirmed by sequencing. After hybridization, the solution was removed and the membranes were washed twice in 2× SSC and 0.2% SDS for 20 min at 30 °C, followed by another two washes in 0.1× SSC and 0.2% SDS for 40 min at 50 °C. The membranes were then exposed to a PhosphorImager screen and scanned in a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and analyzed with ImageQuant software. The same membranes were analyzed with all three clones; between hybridizations, the membranes were stripped of previous hybridizations by incubating them for 30 min in 0.1× SSC with 0.1% SDS at 95 °C. 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid carbonyl cyanidep-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone Both brown fat and liver mitochondria were prepared principally as described by Cannon and Lindberg (11Cannon B. Lindberg O. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 55: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). For brown fat mitochondria, the interscapular, periaortic, axillary, and cervical deposits from 10 animals were dissected out and pooled. Livers from two of these animals were also dissected out and pooled. Tissues were then minced with scissors, homogenized in 40 ml of 250 mm sucrose solution, filtered through gauze, and centrifuged at 8500 × g for 10 min. The pellets were resuspended in sucrose and centrifuged at 800 ×g for 10 min. The resulting supernatants were then centrifuged at 8500 × g for 10 min, and the pellets resuspended in 100 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.2), 0.2% fatty-acid-free bovine serum albumin. After recentrifugation at 8500 × g for 10 min, the mitochondria were further washed in and finally resuspended in KCl/Tris (without albumin). Protein was measured with the fluorescamine method (Fluram from Fluka) and the suspensions diluted to stock concentrations of 20 mg/ml. The GDP-binding capacity of the mitochondria was estimated essentially as described previously (12Nedergaard J. Cannon B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 164: 681-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, mitochondria were incubated for 10 min at room temperature in glass vials at a concentration of 1 mg/ml mitochondrial protein in a medium consisting of 125 mmsucrose, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.2), 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% fatty-acid-free bovine serum albumin, 4 mm potassium phosphate, and 5 μm rotenone. (A hypotonic medium is necessary to avoid matrix condensation (13Nicholls D.G. Grav H.J. Lindberg O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 31: 526-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).) 10 μm GDP (Sigma) labeled with 800,000 cpm/ml [3H]GDP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added for the binding, and [14C]sucrose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to about 300,000 cpm/ml, as a marker for the extramitochondrial volume. 0.4 ml of the incubation mixture was filtered under vacuum through a 0.45-μm cellulose-nitrate filter (Sartorius GmbH, Götingen, Germany). The filters were then fully dissolved in 5 ml of scintillation fluid for 1 h. The amount of [3H]GDP found on the filter in excess of that predicted from the [14C]sucrose data was defined as specific binding. All assays were performed in quadruplicate for each mitochondrial preparation. Mitochondria, at a final concentration of 0.2 mg/ml mitochondrial protein, were added to 1.1 ml of a continuously stirred incubation medium of the same composition as for the GDP-binding experiments, with the further addition of 0.6 μmrhodamine 123 (Sigma) and either 5 mm glycerol 3-phosphate for brown fat mitochondria or 5 mm succinate for liver mitochondria (brown fat mitochondria may exhibit low permeability for succinate and similar substrates (14Cannon B. Bernson V.S.M. Nedergaard J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 766: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and the use of a substrate oxidizable without membrane permeation (i.e.glycerol-3-phosphate; Ref. 15Nicholls D.G. Bernson V.S.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 75: 601-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) was therefore preferred in the brown fat preparations). All incubations were carried out at 37 °C. Membrane potential was monitored with the cationic fluorescent dye rhodamine 123, on an Aminco DW-2 spectrophotometer in the dual-wavelength mode (516–495 nm) in a manner similar to that described by Emaus et al. (16Emaus R.K. Grunwald R. Lemasters J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 850: 436-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). The absorbance readings were transferred to mV membrane potential based on calibration curves constructed (principally as described previously (Ref. 17Nedergaard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar)) for each of the three types of mitochondrial preparations. The calibration curves were based on the Nernst equation: Δψ = 61 mV · log ([K+]in/[K+]out). Calibration values were obtained from traces in which the extramitochondrial K+ level ([K+]out) was altered in the 1–5 mm range. The change in absorbance caused by the addition of 9 μm valinomycin (mean from two to three independent preparations) was plotted against [K+]out. [K+]in was then estimated by extrapolation of the line to the zero uptake point. The [K+]invalue obtained was 19 mm for brown fat mitochondria from wild-type mice (in good agreement with earlier estimates; Ref. 17Nedergaard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It was nearly the same for brown fat mitochondria from UCP1-ablated mice (17 mm); the value for liver mitochondria from wild-type mice was 26 mm (when calculated as means from each preparation, the values were 18 ± 3, 17 ± 2, and 30 ± 12 mm, respectively). These [K+]in values and the [K+]out values were then entered in the Nernst equation for the calibration. Due to the presence of phosphate in the incubation system used here, the ΔpH is expected to be minimal, and the Δψ and the proton motive force (ΔμH+) should therefore be practically identical (16Emaus R.K. Grunwald R. Lemasters J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 850: 436-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Additions were made as indicated in the legends to the figures. FCCP and oleate were dissolved in 50% ethanol; the ethanol did not in itself have any effects on the parameters measured and is used as zero concentration of agent. As the mitochondrial protein/albumin ratio was low (1/5), albumin is the dominant protein and the level of free fatty acids in the incubation can therefore be considered to be buffered by the albumin. The free concentration of oleate was therefore calculated using the equation from Richieri et al. (18Richieri G.V. Anel A. Kleinfeld A.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7574-7580Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) for the binding of oleate to bovine serum albumin at 37 °C: [FFA] = 6.5ν − 0.19 + 0.13e1.54ν, where ν is the molar ratio of oleate to albumin. The molecular weight of albumin was taken as 60,000. Nominal levels of oleate added were 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120 μm; these thus transfer to free levels of 4, 8, 21, 56, 239, 1354, and 8365 nm. To facilitate comparisons with other studies, the free values of oleate were those used in graphs. As corresponding binding affinity data do not exist for all fatty acids, comparative data on different fatty acids are given as nominal additions (nmol/ml). Oxygen consumption rates were monitored with a Clark-type oxygen electrode in a medium and under other conditions identical to those used for the membrane potential determinations, including the presence of rhodamine. The UCP1-ablated mice had the same body weight as wild-type mice (as earlier observed (Ref. 6Enerbäck S. Jacobsson A. Simpson E.M. Guerra C. Yamashita H. Harper M.-E. Kozak L.P. Nature. 1997; 387: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar)). The total amount of brown adipose tissue that could be dissected out was somewhat larger in the UCP1-ablated mice than in the wild-type, but the tissue was lighter brown, in agreement with it being more fat-filled (6Enerbäck S. Jacobsson A. Simpson E.M. Guerra C. Yamashita H. Harper M.-E. Kozak L.P. Nature. 1997; 387: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar) (data not shown). To confirm the validity and examine the consequences of the UCP1 ablation, mRNA levels for the three members of the uncoupling protein family were determined in brown adipose tissue and in liver (Table I). In wild-type mice, mRNA coding for UCP1, UCP2, and UCP3 was found in brown adipose tissue, in agreement with earlier observations (19Boss O. Samec S. Paoloni-Giacobino A. Rossier C. Dulloo A.

As expected, no full-length Ucp1 mRNA was observable in the brown adipose tissue of the UCP1-ablated mice (but a short transcript was observable (data not shown), as mentioned previously (Ref. 6Enerbäck S. Jacobsson A. Simpson E.M. Guerra C. Yamashita H. Harper M.-E. Kozak L.P. Nature. 1997; 387: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar)). Correspondingly, no UCP1 protein was detectable with polyclonal UCP1-antibodies (22Cannon B. Hedin A. Nedergaard J. FEBS Lett. 1982; 150: 129-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) in immunoblots in these mice (data not shown). The ablation of UCP1 led to a 14-fold increase in Ucp2 mRNA level in the brown adipose tissue (principally in accordance with earlier observations (Ref. 6Enerbäck S. Jacobsson A. Simpson E.M.

The ablation of UCP1 also led to some decrease in Ucp3 mRNA level in the brown adipose tissue (Table I), but the level remained close to that observed in skeletal muscle (data not shown), which, together with brown and white adipose tissue, has the highest reported levels (19Boss O.

In the liver of wild-type mice, there was, as expected, noUcp1 expression, low Ucp2 expression (reported to be only from Kupffer cells under these circumstances (Ref. 26Larrouy D. Laharrague P. Carrera G. Viguerie-Bascands N. Levi-Meyrueis C. Fleury C. Pecqueur C. Nibbelink M. Andre M. Casteilla L. Ricquier D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 760-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar)), and noUcp3 expression (Table I) (19Boss O. Samec S. Paoloni-Giacobino A. Rossier C. Dulloo A. Seydoux J. Muzzin P.

Commun. 1997; 235: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). Thus, the isolated liver mitochondria cannot be expected to contain any UCP1 or UCP3. There may be trace amounts of UCP2 in the preparation, but as Ucp2 is only expressed in the Kupffer cells (26Larrouy D. Laharrague P. Carrera G. Viguerie-Bascands N. Levi-Meyrueis C. Fleury C. Pecqueur C. Nibbelink M. Andre M. Casteilla L. Ricquier D. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Avila M.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 55-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) from which the bulk of the mitochondria in the preparation originates, there is no reason to suspect that this UCP2 will affect the collective properties of the isolated mitochondria to any appreciable extent. The brown fat mitochondria from wild-type mice will be expected to have high UCP1 levels. Based on the expression levels shown above, the brown fat mitochondria from the UCP1-ablated mice could be expected to contain rather high levels of UCP2 and some UCP3. Thus, comparison of the properties of these three types of mitochondria may be helpful in furthering the understanding not only of the effects of UCP1 on mitochondrial bioenergetics, but perhaps also of those of UCP2 and UCP3. For analysis of the effect of UCP1 ablation on mitochondrial bioenergetics, mitochondria were isolated from the brown adipose tissue of wild-type and of UCP1-ablated mice, and from the liver of wild-type mice. The amount of brown fat mitochondria obtained from wild-type mice was slightly higher than from the UCP1-ablated mice. The presence of UCP mRNA in the brown adipose tissue of the wild-type mice (which were housed at 24 °C, i.e. at an ambient temperature significantly below their thermoneutral zone of 30–32 °C) would be expected to lead to the presence of UCP1 associated with a specific GDP-binding capacity. In accordance with this, brown fat mitochondria from wild-type mice had a [3H]GDP-binding capacity of 0.15 nmol/mg (TableII), a value in good agreement with earlier observations made on mice at this acclimation temperature (28Jennings G. Richard D. Trayhurn P. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. A. 1986; 85: 583-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In UCP1-ablated mice, the [3H]GDP-binding capacity was practically eliminated and was reduced to the level observed in the UCP1,2,3-free liver mitochondria (Table II). Thus, indeed, the presence of UCP1 is associated with the ability to bind [3H]GDP.Table IIGDP-binding capacity and effects of GDP on membrane potential of mitochondria isolated from brown adipose tissue of UCP1-ablated and wild-type mice and from liver of wild-type miceMitochondriaGDP bindingMembrane potentialStrainTissue− GDP+ GDPnmol/mg proteinmVUCP1+/+BAT0.15 ± 0.02−33 ± 8−141 ± 2***UCP1−/−BAT0.05 ± 0.02*−195 ± 6**−190 ± 8**UCP1+/+Liver0.05 ± 0.01*−184 ± 3**−177 ± 3**,***[3H]GDP-binding capacities were measured as described under “Materials and Methods,” in three independent preparations of each type, with four replicates for each preparation.

UCP2 and UCP3 possess amino acid sequences similar to that thought to be responsible for nucleotide binding in UCP1. Therefore, these members of the mitochondrial carrier family have been suggested to also be able to bind purine nucleotides (23Negre-Salvayre A. Hirtz C. Carrera G. Cazenave R. Troly M. Salvayre R. Penicaud L. Casteilla L. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 809-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 29Boss O. Muzzin P. Giacobino J.-P. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1998; 139: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). As both of these genes are highly expressed in brown adipose tissue of UCP1-ablated mice (Table I), it may be suggested that some of the residual GDP-binding capacity (TableII) could represent binding to UCP2 or UCP3. However, since the GDP-binding capacities of mitochondria from the UCP1,2,3-free liver and from the highly Ucp2- and Ucp3-expressing brown adipose tissue from UCP1-ablated mice were equal, it could be concluded that high expression levels of Ucp2 or Ucp3 are not predictive of the presence of a high capacity for purine nucleotide binding to mitochondria from that tissue, and perhaps even that UCP2 and UCP3 do not carry a purine nucleotide site with properties similar to that of UCP1. The possibility cannot, of course, be excluded that a purine nucleotide binding site exists on UCP2 or UCP3 with a purine nucleotide selectivity or affinity that is markedly different from that of UCP1 and would thus not be detected with 10 μm[3H]GDP.

This protein has now been shown also to bind to IκBβ and IκBε as well as to induce their ubiquitination and proteolysis. FWD1 was shown to recognize the conserved DSGΨXS motif (where Ψ represents the hydrophobic residue) present in the NH2-terminal regions of these three IκB proteins only when the component serine residues are phosphorylated. However, in contrast to IκBα and IκBβ, the recognition site in IκBε for FWD1 is not restricted to the DSGΨXS motif; FWD1 also interacts with other sites in the NH2-terminal region of IκBε. Substitution of the critical serine residues in the NH2-terminal regions of IκBα, IκBβ, and IκBε with alanines also markedly reduced the extent of FWD1-mediated ubiquitination of these proteins and increased their stability. These data indicate that the three IκB proteins, despite their substantial structural and functional differences, all undergo ubiquitination mediated by the SCFFWD1 complex.

To date, five Rel proteins have been identified in mammals as follows: p50, p52, p65 (RelA), c-Rel, and Rel-B, the first two of which are synthesized as p105 and p100 precursors, respectively (4Ghosh S.

These proteins bind specifically to κB motifs located in the promoters and enhancers of target genes, resulting in transcriptional activation. Furthermore, they all share an ∼300-amino acid region of homology, known as the Rel homology domain, that is responsible for DNA binding, dimerization, and interaction with inhibitory proteins of the IκB family. nuclear factor-κB IκB kinase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ubiquitin ligase The IκB family of inhibitory proteins includes IκBα, IκBβ, IκBε, IκBγ, and Bcl-3 in higher vertebrates (Fig.1 A), all of which contain multiple regions of homology known as ankyrin-repeat motifs (4Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4609) Google Scholar). Such repeats mediate protein-protein interactions, and the specific interaction between ankyrin repeats of IκB proteins and the Rel homology domain of Rel proteins appears to be an important and evolutionarily conserved feature of the regulation of NF-κB (7Simeonidis S.

The number of ankyrin repeats varies among the different IκB proteins and appears to influence the specificity with which IκB pairs with a Rel dimer. The Rel precursor proteins p100 and p105 also contain ankyrin repeats and are sometimes included in the IκB family. IκBα, the best characterized member of the IκB family, is a 37-kDa protein with a tripartite structural organization that is also apparent in IκBβ and which consists of (i) an NH2-terminal domain that is phosphorylated in response to extracellular signals, (ii) a central ankyrin-repeat domain, and (iii) a COOH-terminal PEST domain that is important in the basal turnover of the protein (6Verma I.M.

The defining functional characteristic of IκBα is its ability to confer rapid but transient induction of NF-κB activity as a result of its participation in an autoregulatory feedback loop.

Link E. Baeuerle P.A. Bose Jr., H.R. Verma I.M. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Both IκBα and IκBβ are rapidly degraded after exposure of cells to an appropriate stimulus; however, whereas transcription of theIκBα gene is induced as a result of NF-κB activation that of the IκBβ gene is not (16Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Thus, the abundance of IκBβ remains low until the NF-κB-activating signal is attenuated. IκBε is degraded with slower kinetics than are IκBα and IκBβ (17Whiteside S.T. Epinat J.C. Rice N.R. Israel A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1413-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 19Simeonidis S. Liang S. Chen G. Thanos D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14372-14377Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Unlike IκBα and IκBβ, IκBε contains a cluster of serine residues at the NH2 terminus and lacks a PEST domain at the COOH terminus (Fig. 1 A), suggesting that these differences in structure may underlie the differences in function. The NH2-terminal region of IκBε is rich in Pro, Glu, Asp, Ser, and Thr residues (61 out of 118 residues; 51.7%) and resembles a PEST sequence (17Whiteside S.T. Epinat J.C. Rice N.R. Israel A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1413-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). IκBε does not interact with either p50 or p52; instead, it associates exclusively with p65-p65 and p65-c-Rel complexes and therefore likely regulates the transcription of genes, such as that for interleukin-8, whose promoters bind preferentially to p65 and c-Rel complexes (19Simeonidis S.

Biol. 1993; 13: 6137-6146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The dimeric NF-κB complex is normally sequestered in an inactive form in the cytoplasm through interaction with IκB. In response to signals such as tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1, lipopolysaccharide, ultraviolet irradiation, and viral infection, IκB proteins are rapidly phosphorylated by a protein kinase complex known as IKK (IκB kinase) (21Malinin N.L.

Henzel W.J. Baeuerle P.A. Nature. 1998; 395: 292-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). IKK phosphorylates the 2 serine residues of the DSGΨXS motif (where Ψ represents the hydrophobic residue) in the NH2-terminal regions of IκBα (Ser-32 and Ser-36), IκBβ (Ser-19 and Ser-23), and IκBε (Ser-18 and Ser-22) (Fig. 1 B). Such phosphorylation of IκBα triggers its rapid degradation by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, thereby allowing translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus and activation of target genes (31Palombella V.J.

However, it has remained unknown whether other members of the IκB family are also ubiquitinated in response to cell stimulation and, if so, whether the phosphorylation of the DSGΨXS motifs of IκBβ and IκBε is also required for their ubiquitin-dependent degradation. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway of protein degradation is an important mechanism by which the abundance of specific cellular proteins is regulated (34Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 761-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar, 35Weissman A.M. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 189-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 36Peters J.-M.

The formation of ubiquitin-protein conjugates is mediated by three enzymes that participate in a series of ubiquitin transfer reactions: a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and a ubiquitin ligase (E3). The specificity of protein ubiquitination often derives from the E3 ubiquitin ligases. Proteins that are polyubiquitinated by these enzymes are subjected to degradation by the 26 S proteasome (36Peters J.-M. Harris J.R. Finley D. Ubiquitin and Biology of the Cell. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1998Crossref Google Scholar). Recent genetic and biochemical studies in yeast have identified a class of E3 ligases, termed SCF complexes, that are required for degradation of cyclins and their inhibitors as well as for that of an increasing number of other proteins (37Elledge S.J.

SCF complexes consist of the invariable components Skp1 and Cdc53 (Cullin or Cul1) as well as a variable component known as an F-box protein, which binds to Skp1 through the F-box motif. F-box proteins serve as receptors for the target protein, which is usually phosphorylated. We and others (40Hatakeyama S. Kitagawa M. Nakayama K. Shirane M. Matsumoto M. Hattori K. Higashi H.

FWD1 also interacts with the Skp1-Cul1 complex through its F-box domain, thereby forming an SCF complex, SCFFWD1. Thus, the phosphorylation of IκBα results in the recruitment of FWD1, which links IκBα to the ubiquitination machinery. SCFFWD1therefore plays an important role in transcriptional regulation by NF-κB as a result of its control of IκBα protein stability. We have now investigated whether FWD1 contributes to ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of IκB family members other than IκBα. Our data show that IκBβ and IκBε are also ubiquitinated and that FWD1 mediates the ubiquitination of these proteins in response to their phosphorylation by the IKK complex, thereby triggering their degradation. 293T cells were grown at 37 °C and under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Molecular cloning of the FWD1 and FWD2 cDNAs was described previously (40Hatakeyama S. Kitagawa M. Nakayama K. Shirane M. Matsumoto M. Hattori K. Higashi H. Nakano H. Okumura K. Onoe K. Good R.A.

Complementary DNAs encoding FWD1, FWD2, and FWD1(ΔF), each protein tagged at the NH2 terminus with the FLAG or Myc epitope, were generated with the use of the polymerase chain reaction, as performed with the high fidelity thermostable DNA polymerase KOD (Toyobo, Tokyo, Japan); they were then sequenced and subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).

The cell lysates were pretreated with 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 4 °C and were then incubated with 5 μg of the appropriate antibodies and protein G-Sepharose beads for 4 h at 4 °C. The resulting immunoprecipitates were then washed thoroughly four times with ice-cold lysis buffer, fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), and subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies (1 μg/ml) to Myc (9E10; Roche Diagnostics, Tokyo, Japan), to the FLAG epitope (M5; Sigma), or to ubiquitin (1B3; MBL, Nagoya, Japan). Transfected 293T cells were metabolically labeled with Tran35S-label (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) at a concentration of 100 μCi/ml for 1 h. After incubation for various times in the absence of isotope, the cells were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies to Myc (9E10) and protein G-Sepharose.

We therefore investigated whether FWD1 also associates with IκBβ and IκBε through their phosphorylated DSGΨXS motifs. Expression plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged IκBα, IκBβ, IκBε, or their SA mutants, in which serine was replaced with alanine at positions 32 and 36 (S32A/S36A), 19 and 23 (S19A/S23A), or 18 and 22 (S18A/S22A), respectively, were introduced into 293T cells with or without plasmids encoding Myc-tagged IKKβ, AU1-tagged MEKK1, and Myc-tagged FWD1. Immunoprecipitation assays revealed that Myc-tagged FWD1 was present in the IκBα, IκBβ, and IκBε immunoprecipitates prepared with antibodies to FLAG (Fig.2). The SA mutants of IκBα and IκBβ did not interact with FWD1, indicating that FWD1 recognizes the serine-phosphorylated DSGΨXS motif. In contrast, association of the SA mutant of IκBε with FWD1 was apparent. The observed pattern of ubiquitination of the IκB proteins was consistent with the pattern of FWD1 binding. FWD1 markedly increased the ubiquitination of wild-type IκBα and IκBβ but not that of the corresponding SA mutants. In contrast, both wild-type IκBε and its SA mutant were ubiquitinated in the presence of FWD1, although the extent of ubiquitination of the SA mutant was less than that apparent with the wild-type protein. These results indicate that FWD1 interacts with all three IκB proteins and thereby promotes their ubiquitination, although the mode of binding appears to differ between IκBα and IκBβ on the one hand and IκBε on the other, probably as a result of the corresponding structural differences between these proteins: IκBε contains additional serine residues present within SXXXS motifs in the NH2-terminal region and lacks a COOH-terminal PEST domain (Fig. 1). To investigate further the role of FWD1 in IκBβ ubiquitination, we examined whether IKK activity is required for this reaction. Expression of IKKβ alone with IκBβ in 293T cells resulted in a small increase in the extent of IκBβ ubiquitination (Fig. 3), which was likely mediated by endogenous FWD1. However, expression of both IKKβ and FWD1 together with IκBβ induced a marked increase in IκBβ ubiquitination. The interaction of IκBβ with FWD1 was observed only in the presence of exogenous IKKβ. Another mammalian F-box and WD40 repeat protein, FWD2 (or MD6), neither interacted with IκBβ, even in the presence of IKKβ, nor increased the extent of its ubiquitination, confirming that the interaction between FWD1 and IκBβ is specific. Furthermore, FWD1 did not bind to the S19A/S23A mutant of IκBβ in the presence of IKKβ. These results suggest that FWD1-induced ubiquitination requires prior phosphorylation of IκBβ on Ser-19 and Ser-23 by the IKK complex. We previously showed that FWD1 links IκBα to the Skp1-Cul1 complex as a result of the interaction of Skp1 with the F-box motif of FWD1. We therefore examined whether the F-box domain of FWD1 is also essential for the ubiquitination of IκBβ. The FWD1(ΔF) mutant, which lacks the F-box domain (amino acids 148 to 192), did not induce ubiquitination of IκBβ in the presence of IKKβ, although FWD1(ΔF) did interact with IκBβ (Fig.4 A). A pulse-chase experiment indicated that expression of FWD1 increased the rate of degradation of IκBβ relative to that apparent in cells expressing FWD2 (Fig.4 B). The FWD1(ΔF) mutant had no such effect, consistent with its inability to induce ubiquitination of IκBβ. Together, these observations suggest that FWD1, acting as a component of the SCFFWD1 complex, functions as an intracellular receptor for IκBβ and thereby promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of this protein. We have shown that FWD1 promotes the ubiquitination of IκBε (Fig. 2). However, unlike IκBα and IκBβ, the recognition motif for FWD1 in IκBε was not restricted to the phosphorylated DSGΨXS sequence because the S18A/S22A mutant of IκBε was also ubiquitinated, although to a reduced extent compared with that apparent with the wild-type protein. We therefore investigated whether phosphoserine residues located within other SXXXS motifs in the NH2-terminal region of IκBε contribute to FWD1-mediated ubiquitination of this protein. FWD1 bound to IκBε and elicited marked ubiquitination in the absence of exogenous IKKβ (Fig.5 A), whereas the ubiquitination of IκBα and IκBβ requires exogenous IKK activity. Furthermore, an IκBε mutant (SA-all) in which all nine serine residues within SXXXS motifs were replaced with alanines also associated with FWD1 and was ubiquitinated, although to a reduced extent relative to that observed with the wild-type protein (Fig. 5 A). An IκBε mutant (ΔN) that lacked the entire NH2-terminal domain (residues 1–118) neither bound to FWD1 nor was ubiquitinated. Thus, the susceptibility to ubiquitination of the various IκBε proteins examined decreases in the rank order wild-type > S18A/S22A > SA-all > ΔN. These results suggest that FWD1 interacts predominantly with Ser-18 and Ser-22 within the DSGΨXS motif of IκBε but is also able to bind to other serine residues in the NH2-terminal region of the protein. With regard to the observation that FWD1-mediated ubiquitination of IκBε did not require exogenous IKK, it was possible that FWD1 interacted with IκBε in an IKK-independent manner. Alternatively, the small amount of endogenous IKK might have been sufficient to promote the FWD1-IκBε interaction. Immunoblot analysis indeed revealed the presence of endogenous IKKβ in 293T cells (data not shown). We investigated these two possibilities by introducing a kinase-negative mutant of IKKβ (K44M) into 293T cells to inhibit the endogenous IKK activity. This mutant markedly inhibited the interaction between FWD1 and IκBε as well as FWD1-induced ubiquitination of IκBε in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5 B), suggesting that endogenous IKK is required for both these events. Thus, whereas signal-induced activation of the IKK complex is required for the proteolysis of IκBα and IκBβ, IκBε appears to be constitutively degraded as a result of the low level of endogenous IKK activity. To investigate further whether the phosphorylation-induced interaction with FWD1 promotes the degradation of IκBα, IκBβ, and IκBε, we performed pulse-chase experiments (Fig. 6). In the presence of FWD1 and IKKβ, both IκBα and IκBβ were rapidly degraded, although the kinetics of IκBβ degradation were slightly slower that those of IκBα degradation. The rates of degradation of the IκBα(S32A/S36A) and IκBβ(S19A/S23A) mutants were markedly reduced relative to those of the corresponding wild-type proteins, indicating that FWD1 promotes degradation of both IκBα and IκBβ after specific phosphorylation of the DSGψXS motif. The half-life of IκBε was longer than those of IκBα and IκBβ, as previously demonstrated (17Whiteside S.T. Epinat J.C. Rice N.R. Israel A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1413-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The IκBε(SA-all) mutant was more stable than was wild-type IκBε, consistent with our observation that the extent of ubiquitination of the mutant was markedly reduced compared with that of the wild-type protein (Fig. 5 A). Thus, phosphorylation of serine residues present within SXXXS motifs in its NH2-terminal region appears to influence the stability of IκBε. We and others (40Hatakeyama S. Kitagawa M. Nakayama K.

Human FWD1 was also shown to interact with the Vpu protein of human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (49Margottin F. Bour S.P. Durand H. Selig L. Benichou S. Richard V. Thomas D. Strebel K. Benarous R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 565-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). IκBα, IκBβ, IκBε, β-catenin, and Vpu all share a DSGΨXS motif (Fig. 1 B), the two serines in which undergo signal-induced phosphorylation. This shared property suggested that FWD1 might recognize the phosphorylated DSGΨXS motif in each of these proteins, as we showed was the case for IκBα. The phosphorylated DSGΨXS motif thus might constitute a signal for FWD1-mediated ubiquitination. In the present study, we therefore investigated whether FWD1 also mediates the ubiquitination of IκBβ and IκBε. Indeed, our data show that FWD1 also serves to link these two proteins to the core complex of the SCF ubiquitin ligase in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. The structural organization of IκBε differs from that of IκBα and IκBβ (4Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4609) Google Scholar). Whereas IκBα and IκBβ contain a PEST domain in the COOH-terminal region, IκBε contains a putative PEST domain in the NH2-terminal region, upstream of the ankyrin repeats (Fig. 1 A) (17Whiteside S.T.

The DSGΨXS motif is present in the NH2-terminal regions of all three proteins; however, IκBε also contains four additional SXXXS motifs clustered in this region (Fig. 1 C). Although FWD1 interacts with IκBα, IκBβ, and IκBε, the mode of interaction with IκBα and IκBβ appears to differ from that for IκBε. Thus, mutation of the two serines in the DSGΨXS motifs of IκBα and IκBβ to alanines prevented both the interaction of these proteins with FWD1 and their FWD1-mediated ubiquitination as well as increased their stability. These data indicate the absolute requirement for the DSGΨXS motif in the interaction of IκBα or IκBβ with FWD1. In contrast, mutation of the two serines in the DSGΨXS motif of IκBε did not prevent its binding to FWD1. Furthermore, the IκBε(SA-all) mutant, in which the serines in all five SXXXS motifs were replaced by alanines, also interacted with FWD1, although the extent of its ubiquitination was substantially reduced compared with that of the wild-type protein. Hence, FWD1 appears to recognize motifs other than SXXXS in IκBε. Together, our data indicate that FWD1 is important for the ubiquitination of these three IκB proteins, although the manner of association appears to differ between IκBα and IκBβ on the one hand and IκBε on the other hand. Another difference between IκBα and IκBβ versusIκBε is that although FWD1 binding to and efficient ubiquitination of IκBα and IκBβ in 293T cells required introduction of both FWD1 and IKKβ, IκBε interacted with FWD1 and underwent ubiquitination in the presence of exogenous FWD1 alone (without introducing exogenous IKKβ). Our observation that a kinase-negative mutant of IKKβ (K44M) inhibited both the interaction of IκBε with FWD1 and its ubiquitination suggests that endogenous IKK activity was necessary and sufficient for these reactions to proceed. However, we also showed that IKKβ phosphorylated IκBε specifically on Ser-18 and Ser-22 in transfected 293T cells (data not shown). This result appears inconsistent with the observation that the IκBε(S18A/S22A) mutant retained the ability to undergo ubiquitination, but it might be explained by IKKβ phosphorylation of other kinases or modulators that promote the interaction of FWD1 with IκBε. Although IκBα, IκBβ, and IκBε all appear to undergo FWD1-mediated ubiquitination, and at least IκBα and IκBβ seem to be phosphorylated in a similar manner, the three proteins exhibited differential stabilities. It is possible that factors other than phosphorylation of the DSGΨXS motif affect the interaction of FWD1 with the IκB proteins. Simeonidis et al. (7Simeonidis S. Stauber D. Chen G. Hendrickson W.A. Thanos D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) showed that the structural differences in the NH2-terminal regions of IκBα, IκBβ, and IκBε may contribute to the differential stabilities of the three proteins. The COOH-terminal structures, which are thought to control basal turnover, also differ among the three proteins (6Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Van Antwerp D. Miyamoto S.

Thus, regulatory mechanisms other than the FWD1-dependent pathway also may contribute to control of the stability of IκB proteins (50Han Y. Meng T. Murray N.R. Fields A.P. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 939-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Although the underlying mechanisms responsible for the differential down-regulation of IκB proteins remain to be fully characterized, it is clear that FWD1 is an important regulator of NF-κB signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2317413854,"Granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-3 (IL-3) and interleukin-5 (IL-5 belong to a family of cytokines that regulate proliferation, differentiation and function of haematopoietic cells. Their receptor consists of a ligand specific α-chain and a signal transducing β-chain (βc). While, the role of phosphotyrosine residues in the βc as mediators of downstream signalling cascades has been established, little is known about non-phosphotyrosine mediated events. To identify proteins interacting with βc, we screened a yeast two-hybrid library with the intracellular domain of βc. We found that RACK1, a molecule associating with activated PKC, PLCγ and Src kinases, associated with the membrane proximal region of βc in both yeast two-hybrid, immunoprecipitation and GST-pull-down assays. The association of RACK1 was constitutive, demonstrating no alteration upon cellular stimulation. Furthermore, upon stimulation of cells with IL-5 or PMA, a complex of βc and PKCβ was found. Together, these findings suggest a novel role for RACK1 as a possible adapter molecule associating with the intracellular domain of cytokine receptors."

https://openalex.org/W2024155057,"We report here the characterization and the molecular analysis of the two high affinity permeases that mediate the transport of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) and S-methylmethionine (SMM) across the plasma membrane of yeast cells. Mutant cells unable to use AdoMet as a sulfur source were first isolated and demonstrated to lack high affinity AdoMet transport capacities. Functional complementation cloning allowed us to identify the corresponding gene (SAM3), which encodes an integral membrane protein comprising 12 putative membrane spanning regions and belonging to the amino acid permease family. Among amino acid permease members, the closest relative of Sam3p is encoded by the YLL061w open reading frame. Disruption of YLL061w was shown to specifically lead to cells unable to use SMM as a sulfur source. Accordingly, transport assays demonstrated that YLL061w disruption mutation impaired the high affinity SMM permease, and YLL061w was therefore renamed MMP1. Further study of sam3Delta and mmp1Delta mutant cells showed that in addition to high affinity permeases, both sulfonium compounds are transported into yeast cells by low affinity transport systems that appear to be carrier-facilitated diffusion."

In this study, we present several lines of evidence implying AP-1 in regulating expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (timp-1) gene in rodent hippocampus in response to increased neuronal excitation. Such a notion is supported by the findings that timp-1 mRNA accumulation occurs in the rat hippocampus after either kainate- or pentylenetetrazole-evoked seizures with a delayed, in comparison with AP-1 components, time course, as well as with spatial overlap with c-Fos protein (major inducible AP-1 component) expression. Furthermore, AP-1 sequence derived from timp-1 promoter is specifically bound by hippocampal AP-1 proteins after treating the rats with either pro-convulsive agent. Finally, timp-1 promoter responds to excitatory activation both in vivo, in transgenic mice harboring the timp-LacZ gene construct, and in vitro in neurons of the hippocampal dentate gyrus cultures.

An obvious obstacle in elucidating this function is the lack of reliable interventive strategies to affect AP-1 within nervous tissue in vivo. An alternative approach is the identification of AP-1-driven genes. However, only very few such targets in the brain have so far been identified, and moreover, none of them apparently unequivocally (see Ref. 4Herdegen T. Leah J.D. Brain Res. Rev. 1998; 28: 370-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar, for discussion). This situation stems from the fact that this task is very complex and requires a multitude of approaches, correlative in the brain and functional in the culture dish. Recently, several pieces of information have pointed to the genetimp-1, encoding the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP-1) as a possible AP-1 target in the central nervous system. Increased expression of this gene has been reported in rat brain following treatment with kainate, a glutamate receptor agonist as well as pro-convulsive and neurotoxic drug that is also well known to activate AP-1 (1Morgan J.I.

The present studies were designed to test the hypothesis that AP-1 may control timp-1 gene expression in rodent hippocampus in response to enhanced neuronal excitation. Such a hypothesis appears to be very attractive, since if proven, could reveal an important biological function of AP-1. Wistar male rats weighing 250–300 g from the Nencki Institute animal facility were used for the studies. In the experiments with animals, the rules established by the Ethical Committee on Animals Research of the Nencki Institute and based on national laws were strictly followed. Intraperitoneal administration of either kainate (10 mg/kg) or pentylenetetrazole (PTZ, 50 mg/kg) was performed as described previously (11Hetman M. Filipkowski R.K. Domagala W. Kaczmarek L. Exp. Neurol. 1995; 36: 53-63Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 12Kaminska B. Filipkowski R.K. Zurkowska G. Lason W. Przewlocki R. Kaczmarek L. Eur. J.

Briefly, to exclude effects of the injection itself, the animals were handled and injected with physiological saline daily for 3–4 days before the experimental treatment. The rats were then given either sodium kainate (Sigma) or PTZ (RBI) by intraperitoneal injection and observed for up to 90 min to confirm the occurrence or absence of convulsions. Only the animals displaying clear seizures (that occur a few minutes after PTZ treatment and are initiated at 30–60 min following kainate administration) were used for the experiments (that is, typically in our hands, more than 80% of rats). For collection of the material, rats were decapitated at different times after the drug administration (4–6 animals for each time point), the brains were removed and processed as described in details below. TIMP-LacZ transgenic mice were obtained from Dr. B. R. Williams (14Flenniken A.M. Williams B.R.G. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1094-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The animals carry the fragment oftimp-1 gene extending from −1373 to +727 (see Fig. 1) fused to LacZ gene encoding reporter enzyme β-galactosidase. Fidelity of the gene construct expression has been documented during development, when patterns of β-galactosidase activity were found to mimic expression of the endogenous timp-1 gene (14Flenniken A.M. Williams B.R.G. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1094-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Isolated brains were rapidly dissected on ice and the hippocampi were snap-frozen on dry ice. RNA was isolated from frozen tissue according to the procedure of Chomczynski and Sacchi (15Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar) and electrophoresed through 1% agarose gel as described (12Kaminska B. Filipkowski R.K. Zurkowska G. Lason W. Przewlocki R. Kaczmarek L. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1994; 6: 1558-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). After blotting onto nylon membranes (Hybond N, Amersham) the filters were prehybridized for 2 h and then hybridized overnight with random primer-labeled probes in Church buffer (12Kaminska B.

Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 185: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) was followed. Isolated brains were immediately frozen on dry ice. Twenty micrometer cryostat sections were fixed in 4% cold paraformaldehyde in PBS, dehydrated, and prehybridized for 2 h at 37 °C in buffer containing: 50% formamide, 2 × SSC (0.3 m sodium chloride, 0.03m sodium citrate, pH 7,0), 1 × Denhardt's solution (0.02% Ficoll 400, 0.02% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.02% bovine serum albumin), 200 μg/ml single-stranded DNA, and 20 mmdithiothreitol. Next, the sections were hybridized overnight in the above solution containing additionally 10% dextran sulfate and35S-labeled cDNA (random primers) probe at 37 °C. The probe was kindly provided by Dr. Y. Citri (5Nedivi E. Hevroni D. Naot D. Israeli D. Citri Y. Nature. 1993; 363: 718-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). The sections were washed for 15 min and then for 60 min in 50% formamide, 2 × SSC at room temperature. Afterward, the sections were exposed against β-Max Hyperfilm (Amersham). The autoradiograms were analyzed with an aid of PC-based computer program Provision. The expression of c-Fos protein was assessed essentially as described before (18Kaminska B. Kaczmarek L. Chaudhuri A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 3968-3978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following the appropriate treatments, as indicated under “Results,” the rats were anaesthetized with chloride hydrate overdose and perfused with saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The brains were removed and stored in the same fixative for 24 h at 4 °C and then in 30% sucrose with 0.02% sodium azide at 4 °C until needed. The brains were slowly and gradually frozen in a heptane/dry ice bath and sectioned at 20 μm on a cryostat. The sections were washed three times in PBS, pH 7.4, incubated 10 min in 0.3% H2O2 in PBS, washed twice in PBS, then incubated with a polyclonal antibody (anti-c-Fos, 1:1000, Santa Cruz number sc-52) for 48 h at 4 °C in PBS with azide (0.01%) and normal goat serum (3%). After that the sections were washed three times in PBS containing Triton X-100 (0.3%, Sigma), incubated with goat anti-rabbit biotinylated secondary antibody (1:1000, Vector) in PBS/Triton and normal goat serum (3%) for 2 h, washed three times in PBS/Triton, incubated with avidin-biotin complex (1:1000, Vector, in PBS/Triton) for 1 h and washed three times in PBS. The immunostaining reaction was developed using the glucose oxidase-3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrachloride-nickel method. The sections were incubated in PBS with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrachloride (0.05%), glucose (0.2%), ammonium chloride (0.04%), ammonium nickel sulfate (0.1%) (all from Sigma) for 5 min, then 10% (v/v) glucose oxidase (Sigma, 10 units/ml in H2O) was added. The staining reaction was stopped by two to three washes with PBS. The sections were mounted on gelatin-covered slides, air-dried, dehydrated in ethanol solutions and xylene, and embedded in Entellan (Merck). Brain tissue from the rat hippocampi was extracted and immediately processed on ice for nuclear protein extraction (12Kaminska B. Filipkowski R.K. Zurkowska G. Lason W. Przewlocki R. Kaczmarek L. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1994; 6: 1558-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 18Kaminska B. Kaczmarek L. Chaudhuri A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 3968-3978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The tissue was manually pulverized with a Teflon pestle and suspended in 0.5 ml of buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors: 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml pepstatin A) (all products from Sigma). After incubation for 15 min on ice, Nonidet P-40 was added to final concentration of 1% before centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 1 min at 4 °C. The crude pellet was resuspended in buffer B (20 mm Hepes, 0.84 m NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.4 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 25% (v/v) glycerol, and protease inhibitors as above) and incubated for 15 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation for 15 min at 12,000 rpm, the supernatant was frozen at −70 °C. The protein content was estimated by the Bradford method and verified by Coomassie staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 12% Tris glycine gels. We applied the EMSA technique to assess the DNA binding activities of the extracted nuclear proteins from the different experimental conditions. Fifteen micrograms of nuclear proteins were preincubated for 10 min at room temperature in binding buffer (10 mmHepes, 25 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.25 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μg/ml poly(dI-dC) and subsequently incubated with 40 fmol (30,000–40,000 Cerenkov's cpm) of end-labeled probe for 20 min at room temperature. The timp-1 promoter-derived sequences as well as their mutated variants were used in the experiments (Fig. 1). The probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham) and purified on Sephadex G-50 spun columns. Following incubation, 2 μl of loading buffer containing 0.3% bromphenol blue, 3% glycerol was added to the samples and electrophoresed at 130 V for 2 h in a nondenaturing 4% polyacrylamide gel. Electrophoresis was performed in a low ionic strength buffer (6.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mmEDTA, and 3.3 mm sodium acetate). Gels were dried and exposed to phosphor screens (Molecular Dynamics) overnight. Gel images were obtained with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). To facilitate comparison among the different conditions, the autoradiograms were scanned densitometrically and average gray/pixel level was measured in the area of the band. To identify the components of the AP-1 complex, supershift analysis was applied (12Kaminska B. Filipkowski R.K. Zurkowska G. Lason W. Przewlocki R. Kaczmarek L. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1994; 6: 1558-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 13Lukasiuk K. Kaczmarek L. Brain Res. 1994; 643: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Commercially available (Santa Cruz) polyclonal antibodies against the following members of AP-1 family were used: c-Fos (sc-52X), FosB (sc-48X), Fra-1 (sc-183X), Fra-2 (sc-171X), JunB (sc-46X), c-Jun (sc-822X), and JunD (sc-74X). All antibodies (1 mg/1 ml) were affinity purified by the manufacturer and had no detectable cross-reactivity with other members of the Fos and Jun families. This was confirmed by Western blot analysis (see Refs. 12Kaminska B. Filipkowski R.K. Zurkowska G. Lason W. Przewlocki R. Kaczmarek L. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1994; 6: 1558-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar and 18Kaminska B. Kaczmarek L. Chaudhuri A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 3968-3978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One microliter of each antibody was added to 10 μl of reaction volume containing the nuclear protein extract (10 μg) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Afterward, the labeled oligonucleotide was added to the reaction mixture and the EMSA protocol was followed, as described above. The samples were then electrophoresed at 110 V for 5 h with recirculation of the electrophoresis buffer. Gels were dried and exposed to phosphor screens and analyzed with a PhosphorImager as described above. Primary cultures of dentate gyrus cells were obtained from 5-day-old rat pups using a modification of procedure described previously (19Figiel I. Kaczmarek L. Neurochem. Int. 1997; 31: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, hippocampal tissue was sliced mechanically and placed in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate medium supplemented with 3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 1.2 mm MgSO4 (solution A). The area dentata was then dissected from each slice and transferred to a tube containing the same solution. After a short centrifugation at 150 × g, the tissue was resuspended in 5 ml of the solution A containing 0.05 mg/ml trypsin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and left in a rotary bath at 37 °C (200 rpm) for 20 min. Next, 5 ml of solution A, containing 12.8 μg/ml DNase I (Sigma) and 83 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor was added to the suspension, which was immediately centrifuged. The pellet was resuspended in 3 ml of the same solution, containing in addition 80 μg/ml DNase I, 0.52 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, and 2.7 mm MgSO4. The tissue was dissociated with a Pasteur pipette, sedimented for 15 min, and the pellet was redissociated as above in 2 ml. The two supernatants were collected and supplemented with 3 ml of Krebs-Ringer biocarbonate medium containing 3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2.4 mmMgSO4, and 0.1 μm CaCl2. After centrifugation for 10 min at 150 × g the pellet was resuspended in the culture medium. Cells were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips at a density of 150,000 per coverslip. Cultures were maintained for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's (DMEM, Life Technologies, Inc.) medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (with 25 mm KCl, 2 mm glutamine and penicillin (50 units/ml)/streptomycin (50 μg/ml)). Twenty-four h later the cultures were transferred into the chemically defined medium consisting of DMEM supplemented with 1 × N-2 Supplement (Life Technologies, Inc.), 25 mm KCl, 2 mm glutamine, and penicillin (50 units/ml)/streptomycin (50 μg/ml). Cells grown for 4 days in vitro were transfected using the calcium-phosphate procedure. A day later, the cells were exposed to glutamate (0.1 mm). The gene constructs used in this study to assess thetimp-1 AP-1 activity in cultured dentate gyrus neurons are schematically depicted in the Fig. 1. The genes were constructed from fragments of wild type timp-1promoter or promoter mutated in AP-1 site that were obtained by polymerase chain reaction with prT-61CAT and prTmut(AP1)CAT plasmids (8Bugno M.

For all reactions the same pair of polymerase chain reaction primers were used: 5′-gcagttctactcgagcttgcatgcctgcaggtcga-3′ and 5′-ggctaggatcctgaaaatctcgccaagtctgtcgag-3′. Both, p61PTimp1(AP1)GFP and p61Ptimp1(AP1mut)GFP, were generated by subcloning the aforementioned polymerase chain reaction products digested with XhoI-BamHI into theXhoI-BamHI sites of pEGFP-1 plasmid (CLONTECH). All constructs were verified by sequencing. prT-61CAT and prTmut(AP1)CAT plasmids were kindly provided by Dr. T. Kordula (8Bugno M. Greave L. Gatsios P. Koj A. Heinrich P.C. Travis J. Kordula T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 5041-5047Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). For each transfection 3 μg of total plasmid DNA per coverslip were used. Usually a 2:1 ratio of timp-1 promoter containing vector p61PTimp1(AP1)GFP or p61Ptimp1(AP1mut)GFP to pSVβgal (used for assessing the transfection efficiency during the normalization steps of evaluation of the results) was used. All plasmids were purified using EndoFree Plasmid Maxi Kit (QIAgen). Neurons from dentate gyrus of hippocampus were transfected by the calcium phosphate method described earlier (20Xia Z. Dudek H. Miranti C.K. Greenberg M.E. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5425-5436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications. Cells growing for 4–5 days were used for transfection. The culture medium was removed and saved. The cells growing on coverslips were moved into a 24-well dish (one coverslip per each well) and incubated for 1 h in 300 μl of preheated DMEM containing 2 mmsodium kynurenate, 10 mm MgCl2. During this time DNA/calcium phosphate precipitate was prepared. One volume of DNA in 0.5 m CaCl2 was added dropwise to the 1 volume of 2 × Hepes-buffered saline (2 × HBS: 274 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1.4 mmNa2HPO4·7H2O, 15 mmd-glucose, 42 mm HEPES, pH 7.08) and the mixture was left for 30 min in room temperature to let the precipitate form. After 30 min of precipitate formation, 33 μl of mixture was added to the cells. Cultures were incubated with DNA/calcium phosphate precipitate for 35 min. After incubation, the cells were washed once with DMEM, 2 mm sodium kynurenate, 10 mm MgCl2, and twice with DMEM. The saved conditioned medium was mixed 1:1 with new medium and added back to the cells. Twenty-four h after the transfection, the cells were exposed to 0.1 mm glutamate. After 24-h cultures were analyzed under the fluorescent microscope to score for GFP-positive cells. Afterward, cultures were fixed and stained with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside to score for β-galactosidase transfectants. For normalization purposes (see above) the pSVβgal co-transfected cells were washed once with PBS and fixed for 5 min in 1% formaldehyde, 0.2% glutaraldehyde in PBS. Then the cells were incubated overnight at 37 οC in 0.8 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside, 4 mm K3Fe(CN)6, 4 mmK4Fe(CN)6, 4 mmMgCl2·6H2O in PBS. After incubation, the blue-stained cells were counted. Brains were cut into 20 μm-thick sections and loaded on gelatin-coated slides and fixed in for 5 min in 1% formaldehyde, 0.2% glutaraldehyde in PBS at 4 οC. Then the sections were rinsed in PBS twice and incubated overnight in 1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside, 5 mm K3Fe(CN)6, 5 mmK4Fe(CN)6, 2 mmMgCl2·6H2O in PBS at 37 οC. Sections were dehydrated and embedded in Entellan. In the first experiment we analyzed, with Northern blot technique, the time course of timp-1 mRNA accumulation in the hippocampus after treating rats with kainate. We found significant increases intimp-1 mRNA at 6–24 h after the treatment (Fig.2 A). Notably, using exactly the same conditions as previously reported, the mRNA level of c-fos as well as other AP-1 components peak at 1–6 h (12Kaminska B. Filipkowski R.K. Zurkowska G. Lason W. Przewlocki R. Kaczmarek L. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1994; 6: 1558-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The kainate-evoked increase in timp-1 mRNA accumulation at 6 h was greatly suppressed by pretreatment of the rats with the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide (Fig.2 B), suggesting that a significant component oftimp-1 mRNA accumulation requires precedingde novo protein synthesis. To extend the observation of seizure-driven timp-1 mRNA accumulation, and to exclude the possibility that our observations are solely linked to kainate neurotoxicity, we employed another seizure model that involves an application of PTZ, known to produce massive neuronal excitation in the hippocampus without, however, any adverse effects on neuronal survival. Again, a significant increase intimp-1 mRNA levels was observed after the PTZ-evoked seizures, with peak values of timp-1 mRNA levels at 2 h following treatment. Importantly, this elevation was slightly delayed in comparison with c-fos mRNA, that peaked at 45 min after the PTZ injection (Fig. 2C). We also analyzed the spatial pattern of timp-1 mRNA expression at either 6 h after kainate administration or 2 h following PTZ treatment. The in situ hybridization autoradiograms were compared with c-Fos immunocytochemistry performed on parallel sections. Fig. 3 presents the striking resemblance between timp-1 mRNA and c-Fos protein distribution patterns. In the hippocampus of PTZ-treated animal, both timp-1 mRNA and c-Fos protein are most abundant in the dentate gyrus, whereas in the kainate-treated rat expression of both timp-1 and c-Fos occurs throughout the neuronal cell body layer of all hippocampal subfields. To investigate whether timp-1 promoter can be activated following seizures and thus to exclude that timp-1 mRNA accumulation might be solely derived from the increased messenger stability, we employed transgenic mice harboring a gene construct containing the timp-1 regulatory region fused to β-galactosidase coding region (see Fig. 1). The mice were treated with kainate (20 mg/kg) and 24 h later their brains were analyzed for β-galactosidase activity. Fig. 4shows that kainate administration resulted in a marked stimulation of the timp-1 promoter, most notably in the dentate gyrus. A similar, albeit less pronounced, effect was also observed in animals treated with PTZ (50 mg/kg, not shown). In the next series of experiments, we used synthetic oligonucleotides carrying timp-1 gene regulatory sequences spanning the promoter region from −66 to −35 (see Fig. 1), to investigate transcription factors binding before and after either kainate or PTZ treatment. In the first experiment, we investigated the pattern of DNA binding at different times after treatment with kainate. Three major bands of DNA binding could be recognized. Fig.5 A shows the strong binding that was observed in the band designated as I and that was markedly induced at 6 h after kainate administration, i.e. when the timp-1 mRNA starts to peak and thus when one could expect the gene transcription to be active. The intensity of the binding decreased at 24 h following treatment (not shown). In our previous study using a consensus AP-1 sequence as a probe for DNA binding experiments, we reported that 2–6 h after kainate exposure the AP-1 complex is composed predominantly of c-Fos, FosB, JunB, and JunD proteins (12Kaminska B. Filipkowski R.K. Zurkowska G. Lason W. Przewlocki R. Kaczmarek L. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1994; 6: 1558-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Using the AP-1/Stat/Ets sequence derived from thetimp-1 promoter, we found similar AP-1 DNA-binding proteins, including phosphorylated c-Jun (Fig. 5 B). Next, we used wild type (wt) as well as variants of the timp-1 regulatory region, mutated specifically at either AP-1 (mutAP-1) or Stat/Ets (mutStat/Ets) element, to identify its binding proteins present in rat hippocampus 6 h after KA administration. Fig. 5 C shows that a mutation in the AP-1 element completely prevented the kainate-evoked band I protein binding, whereas mutations in Stat/Ets region did not affect any of the bands. Furthermore, we carried out competition experiments in which the hippocampal extracts, obtained from animals at 6 h after kainate, were preincubated with an excess of unlabeled timp-1 regulatory region (either wt or mut) before adding the wild type 32P-labeled probe. Fig.5 C documents that competition with the wild type probe abolishes DNA binding, most notably in bands I and II. Similar effects were also observed in the case of a probe mutated within the Stat/Ets element. In contrast, oligonucleotides mutated in the AP-1 site only weakly affected binding to the wild type probe (Fig.5 C). Essentially the same pattern, indicating requirement for intact AP-1 site of DNA binding of the timp-1 promoter region, was observed at 2 h after treating rats with pentylenetetrazole,i.e. at the time coinciding with timp-1mRNA accumulation in this seizure model (Fig. 5 D). In the previous experiments we found the most robust timp-1mRNA accumulation in hippocampal dentate gyrus granule cell neuronal layer, in response to markedly elevated neuronal excitation. To further investigate the role of timp-1 AP-1 regulatory sequence in excitatory amino acid-driven gene expression we turned to glutamate-stimulated dentate gyrus cells in culture (19Figiel I. Kaczmarek L. Neurochem. Int. 1997; 31: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These cultures derived from 5-day-old rat pups are composed of neuronal and glial elements. The cultures were transfected with a modified calcium phosphate technique (see “Exp"

As the catalytic mechanism employed by type II SPases was not known, the present studies were aimed at the identification of their potential active site residues. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of 19 known type II SPases revealed the presence of five conserved domains. The importance of the 15 best conserved residues in these domains was investigated using the type II SPase of Bacillus subtilis, which, unlike SPase II of Escherichia coli, is not essential for viability. The results showed that only six residues are important for SPase II activity. These are Asp-14, Asn-99, Asp-102, Asn-126, Ala-128, and Asp-129. Only Asp-14 was required for stability of SPase II, indicating that the other five residues are required for catalysis, the active site geometry, or the specific recognition of lipid-modified preproteins. As Asp-102 and Asp-129 are the only residues invoked in the known catalytic mechanisms of proteases, we hypothesize that these two residues are directly involved in SPase II-mediated catalysis. This implies that type II SPases belong to a novel family of aspartic proteases. Type II signal peptidases (SPase II) remove signal peptides from lipid-modified preproteins of eubacteria.

This is a prerequisite for the release of the protein at the transside of the membrane and, in some cases, the posttranslational modification of its amino terminus (for reviews, see Refs. 1Pugsley A.P.

Although the primary structure of signal peptides is poorly conserved, three functional domains have to be present: first, a positively charged amino terminus (N-region); second, a central hydrophobic domain (H-region); and third, a polar carboxyl-terminal domain (C-region), specifying the SPase cleavage site (1Pugsley A.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that five paralogous type I SPases are involved in the processing of secretory precursor proteins in Bacillus subtilis (5van Dijl J.M. de Jong A. Vehmaanperä J. Venema G.

In this respect, B. subtilis is representative for Gram-positive eubacteria and archaea, many of which contain paralogous sip gene families (8Tjalsma H. Bolhuis A. van Roosmalen M.L. Wiegert T.

Considerable similarities can be observed between the known type I SPases when individual amino acid sequences are compared, including strictly conserved serine and lysine residues, which form a catalytic dyad (8Tjalsma H.

Bron S. Sarvas M. van Dijl J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1698-1707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). As estimated from published genome sequences, lipoprotein precursors, which are the substrates of these enzymes, represent about 1–3.5% of the known eubacterial proteomes (14Tjalsma H. Kontinen V.P. Pragai Z. Wu H. Meima R. Venema G. Bron S. Sarvas M. van Dijl J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1698-1707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The major difference between signal peptides of lipoproteins and those of secretory proteins is the presence of a well conserved “lipobox” of four residues in the C-region of lipoprotein signal peptides (3Sankaran K. Wu H.C. von Heijne G. Signal Peptidases. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1994: 17-29Google Scholar, 15von Heijne G. Protein. Eng. 1989; 2: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Invariably, the carboxyl-terminal residue of the lipobox is cysteine, which, upon lipid modification, forms the signal for the retention of the mature lipoprotein at the membrane-cell wall interface of Gram-positive eubacteria, or the inner and outer membranes of Gram-negative eubacteria (16Giam C.Z. Chai T. Hayashi S. Wu H.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 141: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 17Sankaran K. Wu H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19701-19706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Modification of this cysteine residue by the diacylglyceryl transferase (Lgt) is a prerequisite for processing of the lipoprotein precursor by SPase II. In Escherichia coli, mature (apo-)lipoproteins are further modified by amino-fatty acylation of the diacylglyceryl-cysteine amino group (17Sankaran K. Wu H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19701-19706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Tokunaga M. Tokunaga H. Wu H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2253-2259Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The latter modification is probably not conserved in all eubacteria, as B. subtilis and Mycoplasma genitalium lack anlnt gene for the lipoprotein aminoacyltransferase (14Tjalsma H. Kontinen V.P.

Lipoprotein processing by SPase II is essential for cell viability ofE. coli and other Gram-negative eubacteria (19Inukai M. Takeuchi M. Shimizu K. Arai M. J. Antibiot. 1978; 31: 1203-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 20Yamagata H. Ippolito C. Inukai M. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 152: 1163-1168PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the SPase II of B. subtilis is not essential for viability, although the activity of several lipoproteins seems to be strongly impaired in the absence of SPase II (14Tjalsma H. Kontinen V.P. Pragai Z. Wu H. Meima R. Venema G. Bron S. Sarvas M. van Dijl J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1698-1707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 21Bengtsson J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 1698-1707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), which is required for the folding of translocated secretory proteins (22Kontinen V.P. Sarvas M. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 727-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Consequently, the secretion of α-amylase, a nonlipoprotein, was strongly impaired in cells lacking SPase II (14Tjalsma H. Kontinen V.P. Pragai Z. Wu H. Meima R. Venema G. Bron S. Sarvas M. van Dijl J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1698-1707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In contrast to the eubacterial type I SPases, very little is known about the mechanism that type II SPases employ for catalysis (17Sankaran K. Wu H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19701-19706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present studies, which were aimed at the identification of potential active site residues of type II SPases, we made use of the fact that SPase II is not essential for viability of B. subtilis. As a first approach, all residues of the SPase II ofB. subtilis that are conserved in the 19 known eubacterial type II SPases were mutated. The results showed that two strictly conserved aspartic acid residues are essential for the activity, but not the stability, of this enzyme, indicating that type II SPases employ an aspartic acid catalytic dyad for signal peptide cleavage of lipid-modified proteins, similar to aspartic proteases of the pepsin family. A third conserved aspartic acid residue appears to be required for the stability of the SPase II of B. subtilis. TableI lists the plasmids and bacterial strains used.

Consequently, the wild-type or mutant lsp genes on pGDL150–152 were transcribed from the constitutive promoter of theEmrgene present on pGDL48. Site-directed mutations were introduced into plasmid-borne copies oflsp-myc by a two-step PCR approach (10van Dijl J.M. de Jong A. Venema G. Bron S. J. Biol.

Amplified fragments were cleaved with SalI andEcoRI and ligated into the corresponding sites of pGDL48. The resulting plasmids were named pL-x, where x indicates the position and type of amino acid substitution in the corresponding SPase II-Myc mutant proteins.Table IIOligonucleotides used for lsp mutagenesisPrimerSequenceLsp-35′-agtcgtcgacCGTAAACTGGAGGAACGTTTGTG-3′Lsp-45′-tcgaattcTTGTTCTTCTGAAGCGG-3′L-dC5′-atgaattccTTACCCGGCGGCCAACAGCATTTGTATAAAT-3′Lsp-65′-tgaattccttagttcaaatcttcctcactgatcaattTTTGCTCCTTTTTCTTTTTCCCGC-3′L-D14A5′-GTTCTTAACTAGCCATTTTGTCAATTGAgCGGCTGCAATAATAAG-3′L-K18A5′-GTTCTTAACTAGCCAagcTGTCAATTGgTCGGCTGCAATAATAAG-3′L-N45A5′-CCCCCATGCAGCACCCGTAgcGCGATGGGAGGTGATATAG-3′L-G47A5′-CCCCCATGCAGCAgCCGTATTGCGATGGG-3′L-W50A5′-GACCCGCTAAgATCCCCGCTGCAGCACCCGTATTGCG-3′L-G95A5′-CGGACTTATGCTTGGCGcTGCCATCGGCAACTTTATC-3′L-N99A5′-GGCGGTGCCATCGGcgCCTTTATaGATCGGGCTGTCAGAC-3′L-D102A5′-GCCATCGGCACCTTTATCGcTCGGGCTGTCAGAC-3′L-R103A5′-CGGCAACTTTATCGATgcGGCTGTCAGACAGGAAG-3′L-V109A5′-CGGGCTGTCAGACAGGAACcTGTGGATTTTATCCATG-3′L-D111A5′-CAGACAGGAAGTTGTGGcTTTTATCCATGTTATTATTG-3′L-F125A5′-CAATTACAATTACCCGATcgcTATCATCGCGGACTCTTC-3′L-N126A5′-CAATTACAATTACCCGATcTTTgcCATCGCGGACTCTTC-3′L-A128V5′-CAATTACAATTACCCCATcTTTAACATCGttGACTCTTCACTATGTG-3′L-D129A5′-CAATTACAATTACCCGATcTTTAACATCGCGGcCTCTTCACTATGTG-3′Mismatches with the original sequence of lsp are indicated in lowercase.

Pulse-chase labeling of B. subtilis, immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and fluorography were performed as described previously (23van Dijl J.M. de Jong A. Smith H. Bron S. Venema G. Mol. Gen.

Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar. After separation by SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corporation). To detect PrsA or carboxyl-terminally Myc-tagged SPase II, B. subtilis cells were separated from the growth medium, and samples for SDS-PAGE were prepared as described previously (23van Dijl J.M. de Jong A. Smith H. Bron S. Venema G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 227: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For the separation of samples with Myc-tagged SPase II, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1% Triton X-100 were added to the loading buffer for SDS-PAGE as described in Ref. 31Kyhse-Andersen J. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1984; 10: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (2159) Google Scholar. The PrsA protein was visualized with specific antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-anti-rabbit-IgG conjugates (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech); carboxyl-terminally Myc-tagged SPase II was visualized with monoclonal anti c-Myc antibodies (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and horseradish peroxidase-anti-mouse-IgG conjugates. Thus far, the nucleotide sequences of 19 lsp genes for SPase II are known, allowing the detailed comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of the corresponding proteins (Fig. 2). As demonstrated for the SPase II of E. coli (50MuZoa F.J. Miller K.W. Beers R. Graham M. Wu H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17667-17672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), all these type II SPases have four predicted transmembrane (TM) domains (denoted TM-A to -D) (Fig. 3). Two periplasmic (Gram-negative eubacteria) or cell wall-exposed (Gram-positive eubacteria) regions are localized between the TM-A and TM-B regions and between the TM-C and TM-D domains, respectively (Fig. 3). Furthermore, five highly conserved domains (I–V) were detected in these SPases (Figs. 2 and 3): Domain I, containing no strictly conserved residues, is located in TM-A; domain II, containing the strictly conserved residues Asn-45 and Gly-47, is located in the extracytoplasmic region between TM-A and -B; domain III, containing the strictly conserved residues Asn-99 and Asp-102, is located at the junction of TM-C and the extracytoplasmic region between TM-C and -D; domain IV, containing the strictly conserved residues Val-109 and Asp-111, is located in the extracytoplasmic region between TM-C and -D; and domain V, containing the strictly conserved residues Phe-125, Asn-126, Ala-128 and Asp-129, is located at the junction of TM-D and the extracytoplasmic region between TM-C and -D (Fig. 3).Figure 3Membrane topology of SPase II. Model for the membrane topology of type II SPases. The orientation of putative transmembrane regions (A–D) was predicted with the Toppred2 algorithm (51Sipos L. von Heijne G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 1333-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Only the 10 strictly conserved residues in the conserved domains I–V (see Fig. 2) are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Positively charged residues in the cytosolic amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions of type II SPases have been invoked in catalysis (3Sankaran K. Wu H.C. von Heijne G. Signal Peptidases. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1994: 17-29Google Scholar). Notably, the SPase II of B. subtilis lacks an amino-terminal cytosolic region with positively charged residues, refuting that such a region could be required for catalysis (12Pragai Z. Tjalsma H. Bolhuis A. van Dijl J.M. Venema G. Bron S. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 1327-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Like other known type II SPases, the B. subtilis SPase II does, however, contain positively charged carboxyl-terminal residues (four Lys residues). To determine whether the positively charged residues in the carboxyl terminus of the B. subtilis SPase II are important for catalysis, a mutant lsp gene encoding SPase II ΔC (lacking the six carboxyl-terminal residues KKKKEQ), was constructed by PCR and cloned into plasmid pGDL48 (TableIII). To obtain a positive control for SPase II activity, the wild-type lsp gene was also amplified by PCR and cloned into pGDL48. The resulting plasmids, denoted pGDL150 (SPase II) and pGDL151 (SPase II ΔC), were used to transform B. subtilis 8G5 lsp, lacking the lsp gene. Next, pre-PrsA processing to the mature form, which required SPase II activity, was analyzed by pulse-labeling with [35S]methionine for 90 s. As shown in Fig.4 A, almost all labeled PrsA was processed to the mature form in cells producing SPase II ΔC, similar to cells producing the wild-type SPase II (Fig. 4 A). These findings demonstrated that the positively charged carboxyl-terminal residues of the B. subtilis SPase II are not required for catalysis. This suggested that the carboxyl terminus of SPase II could be tagged with a Myc epitope for the immunological detection of this enzyme, without inhibition of catalytic activity. The latter idea was tested by the construction of plasmid pGDL152, which specifies the SPase II-Myc protein. SPase II-Myc contains an extension of nine residues with the sequence KLISEEDLN, which, together with the two authentic carboxyl-terminal residues (EQ) of SPase II, forms the Myc epitope. As shown by pulse labeling, Myc-tagged SPase II could replace wild-type SPase II, as pre-PrsA was efficiently processed to the mature form (Fig. 4 A). Furthermore, the presence of SPase II-Myc in these cells could be demonstrated by Western blotting using Myc-specific antibodies (Fig. 4 B).Table IIICarboxyl termini of wild-type and mutant type II SPasesProteinCarboxyl-terminal amino acid sequenceSPase IIDSGKKKKEQ———SPase II ΔCDSG—————SPase II-MycDSGKKKKEQKLISEEDLN Open table in a new tab Functionally important residues of SPase II were mapped by site-specific mutagenesis. To this purpose, SPase II-Myc was used because the integrity of mutant proteins can be verified with Myc-specific antibodies. Residues present in at least 17 of the 19 known type II SPases were replaced by alanine. The latter residue was chosen because it is small and it has a chemically inert side chain, minimizing conformational strain and indirect effects on catalysis. The strictly conserved residue Ala-128 was replaced by valine, which has a more bulky side chain. Furthermore, Trp-50 was replaced by alanine, because all known type II SPases contain a residue with an aromatic side-chain at this position (tryptophan or phenylalanine) (Fig. 2). To monitor the activity of SPase II mutant proteins specified by plasmids (pL-x) (Table I), processing of pre-PrsA to the mature form was studied in pulse labeling experiments with B. subtilis8G5 lsp. As shown in Fig. 4 A, processing of pre-PrsA was not affected in cells producing the SPase II mutant proteins G47A, F50A, G95A, and F125A, showing that these residues are not required for activity. Processing of pre-PrsA was mildly affected in cells producing the SPase II mutant proteins K18A, R103A, V109A, indicating that these residues are of minor importance for catalysis. Notably, pre-PrsA was not processed, or was processed very inefficiently, in cells producing the SPase II mutant proteins D14A, N45A, N99A, D102A, D111A, N126A, A128V, and D129A, indicating that these residues are either required for catalysis or protein stability. To investigate which of the residues that are important for SPase II activity are determinants for the stability of the enzyme, Western blotting experiments were performed. As shown in Fig. 4 B,only Asp-14 was essential for the stability of SPase II-Myc, whereas all other mutant proteins were detectable. To verify the (in-)activity of the SPase II mutants with strongly reduced activities, pulse-chase labeling experiments were performed with B. subtilis 8G5 lsp. In these experiments, cells were chased with an excess of nonradioactive methionine for 10 min, as it was previously shown that within this period of time no pre-PrsA is converted to the mature form in cells lacking SPase II (14Tjalsma H. Kontinen V.P. Pragai Z. Wu H. Meima R. Venema G. Bron S. Sarvas M. van Dijl J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1698-1707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.5, no labeled pre-PrsA was converted to the mature form in cells producing the SPase II mutant proteins D14A, D102A, A128V, and D129A, suggesting that these proteins are inactive. In contrast, low amounts of labeled mature PrsA were detectable in cells producing the N99A and N126A mutant proteins, and significant levels of pre-PrsA processing were detected in cells producing the N45A and D111A mutant proteins. To determine the effects of the mutations in conserved residues of SPase II at steady state, the accumulation of pre-PrsA in B. subtilis 8G5 lsp was analyzed by Western blotting. It has to be noted that cells lacking SPase II display alternative processing of pre-PrsA to mature-like forms that, on SDS-PAGE, migrate at a slightly reduced rate compared with mature PrsA (14Tjalsma H. Kontinen V.P. Pragai Z. Wu H. Meima R. Venema G. Bron S. Sarvas M. van Dijl J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1698-1707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, only the cells producing the SPase II mutant proteins D14A, N99A, D102A, N126A, A128V, and D129A accumulated precursor and mature-like forms of PrsA. Taken together, our findings show that residues Asn-99, Asp-102, Asn-126, Ala-128, and Asp-129 are critical for SPase II activity and that Asp-14 is critical for SPase II stability. In the present paper, we document the mapping of six functionally important residues of SPase II of B. subtilis. These are Asp-14, Asn-99, Asp-102, Asn-126, Ala-128, and Asp-129. All of these residues are predicted to be localized close to the external surface of the cytoplasmic membrane. Only one residue, Asp-14, was required for the stability of the enzyme, showing that it is an important structural determinant. This view is supported by the fact that the replacement of the equivalent Asp residue in the SPase II of E. coli(Asp-23) by glycine merely resulted in temperature sensitivity of the enzyme (3Sankaran K. Wu H.C. von Heijne G. Signal Peptidases. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1994: 17-29Google Scholar). In addition, Asp-14 of the B. subtilis SPase II is not conserved in the type II SPases of M. genitalium andM. pneumoniae, which have been shown to contain active type II SPases (52Muhlradt P.F. Kiessm M. Meyer H. Sussmuth R. Jung G. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1951-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 53Pyrowolakis G. Hofmann D. Herrmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24792-24796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In contrast, mutation of the other five residues required for activity of the B. subtilis SPase II did not significantly affect the stability of this enzyme, showing that these residues are directly or indirectly required for catalysis. Interestingly, unlike the SPase II of E. coli (38Innis M.A. Tokunaga M. Williams M.E. Loranger J.M. Chang S.Y. Chang S. Wu H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3708-3712Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), theB. subtilis SPase II did not require positively charged residues at the carboxyl terminus for activity, which implies that these residues are structural, rather than catalytic, determinants for the E. coli SPase II. The observation that SPase II lacks conserved serine residues and that the only conserved lysine residue is not required for activity rules out the possibility that type I and type II SPases make use of similar catalytic mechanisms. Furthermore, the lack of conserved cysteine and histidine residues and the previous finding that purified SPase II ofE. coli was active in the absence of metal ions (32Dev I.K. Ray P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11114-11120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrate that SPase II does not employ the well defined catalytic mechanisms of thiol- or metalloproteases. Consequently, the present observation that two strictly conserved aspartic acid residues are essential for SPase II activity indicates that this enzyme belongs to the aspartic proteases. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the SPase II of E. coli could be inhibited by pepstatin, a known inhibitor of aspartic proteases (32Dev I.K. Ray P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11114-11120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aspartic proteases are a group of proteolytic enzymes of the pepsin family that share the same catalytic mechanism and usually function in acidic environments (54Tang J. Wong R.N. J. Cell. Biochem. 1987; 33: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 55Rao J.K. Erickson J.W. Wlodawer A. Biochemistry. 1991; 14: 4663-4671Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 56Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 105-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The known aspartic proteases of eukaryotes are monomeric enzymes, which consist of two subdomains, both containing the conserved sequence Asp-Thr-Gly. All three residues contribute to the active site (57Pearl L.H. Taylor W.R. Nature. 1987; 328: 482Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 58Pearl L.H. Taylor W.R. Nature. 1987; 329: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Furthermore, conserved hydrogen bonds between the catalytic Asp residues and conserved Ser or Thr residues that are located at the +3 position relative to the catalytic Asp are present in most pepsin-like aspartic proteases. These hydrogen bonds are, most likely, responsible for the low pKavalues of the active-site aspartic acid residues (59Cooper J.B. Khan G. Taylor G. Tickle I.J. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 199-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 60Goldblum A. FEBS Lett. 1990; 261: 241-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Aspartic proteases from retroviruses and some plant viruses are related to the eukaryotic aspartic proteases, but the active protease is a homodimer, the active site(s) of which contain the conserved Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly motif (61Miller M. Jaskolski M. Rao J.K. Leis J. Wlodawer A. Nature. 1989; 337: 576-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 62Weber I.T. Miller M. Jaskolski M. Leis J. Skalka A.M. Wlodawer A. Science. 1989; 243: 928-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In contrast to the eukaryotic aspartic proteases, conserved Ser or Thr residues are absent from the +3 position relative to the active site Asp residue of retroviral aspartic proteases. Consequently, the active site Asp residues of retroviral aspartic proteases lack the conserved hydrogen bonding, which explains why these enzymes have a much higher optimum pH than pepsin-like proteases (63Ido E. Han H.P. Kezdy F.J. Tang J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24359-24366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, type II SPases lack the conserved Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly motif of previously described (eukaryotic and viral) aspartic proteases. Moreover, like in the viral aspartic proteases, conserved Ser or Thr residues are absent from the +3 position relative to the putative active site Asp residues. Instead, type II SPases contain strictly conserved Asn residues at the −3 position (Fig. 2), which are very important for activity. These observations imply that the type II SPases belong to a novel class of aspartic proteases. As no type II SPases or otherwise related proteins have been identified in archaea or eukaryotes, it seems that this novel class of aspartic proteases has evolved exclusively in eubacteria. The present observations suggest that SPase II of B. subtilis employs Asp-102 and Asp-129 for catalysis. By analogy to the known catalytic mechanism of aspartic proteases, this implies that Asp-102 and Asp-129, and their equivalents in other type II SPases, form a catalytic dyad. It remains unclear whether the pKa of these residues is reduced by hydrogen bonding, as described for eukaryotic aspartic proteases. If such hydrogen bonds do not exist in type II SPases, this would explain the high optimum pH (7.9) of the SPase II of E. coli (39Tokunaga M. Loranger J.M. Chang S.Y. Regue M. Chang S. Wu H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5610-5615Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The absence of conserved Ser/Thr residues does not, however, exclude the possibility that the pKa of active site aspartic acid residues is modulated by other residues. In fact, this could be one possible role of other residues (i.e. Asn-45, Asn-99, Asp-111, Asn-126, and Ala-128) required for the activity of SPase II ofB. subtilis. Alternatively, the latter residues could be required for the geometry of the active site of type II SPases, or the specific recognition of the diacyl-glyceryl-modified cysteine residues in the lipobox of preproteins. Based on the catalytic mechanism of the aspartic protease of the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (64Silva A.M. Cachau R.E. Sham H.L. Erickson JW. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 19: 321-346Crossref Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 65Liu H. Muller-Plathe F. van Gunsteren W.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 454-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), which is required for viral replication (66Kohl N.E. Emini E.A. Schleif W.A. Davis L.J. Heimbach J.C. Dixon R.A.F. Scolnick E.M. Sigal I.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4686-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar), we propose the following mechanism for type II SPases. At the start of catalysis, the active site contains a so-called “lytic” water molecule, and only one of the active site aspartic acid residues is protonated (Fig.7 A). Upon binding of a lipid-modified precursor, the carbonyl carbon of the scissile peptide bond is hydrated (Fig. 7 B), resulting in a tetrahedral intermediate (Fig. 7 C). During this event, a proton is transferred (via the lytic water molecule) from one active site aspartic acid residue to the other (Fig. 7, C andD). Next, one hydroxyl group of the tetrahedral intermediate donates a proton to the charged aspartic acid residue, and simultaneously, the nitrogen atom at the scissile peptide bond accepts a proton from the other catalytic aspartic acid residue. The latter event results in peptide bond cleavage (processing), regeneration of the catalytic site of SPase II, and release of the mature lipoprotein and the cleaved signal peptide from the enzyme (Fig. 7 D). This model is particularly attractive, because both essential aspartic acid residues are predicted to be located in close proximity to the extracytoplasmic surface of the membrane, similar to the active site serine residue of type I SPases (9Tschantz W.R. Sung M. Delgado-Partin V.M. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27349-27354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10van Dijl J.M. de Jong A. Venema G. Bron S. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2103808515,"Serine proteases of the chymotrypsin family have maintained a common fold over an evolutionary span of more than one billion years. Notwithstanding modest changes in sequence, this class of enzymes has developed a wide variety of substrate specificities and important biological functions. Remarkably, the C-terminal portion of the sequence in the protease domain accounts fully for this functional diversity. This portion is often encoded by a single exon and contains most of the residues forming the contact surface in the active site for the P1–P3 residues of the substrate, as well as domains responsible for the modulation of catalytic activity. The evolution of serine proteases was therefore driven by optimization of contacts made with the unprimed subsites of the substrate and targeted a relatively short portion of the sequence toward the C-terminal end. The dominant role of the C-terminal sequence should facilitate the identification of function in newly discovered genes belonging to this class of enzymes."

https://openalex.org/W1971688748,"During apoptosis, phosphatidylserine (PS) is moved from the plasma membrane inner leaflet to the outer leaflet where it triggers recognition and phagocytosis of the apoptotic cell. Although the mechanisms of PS appearance during apoptosis are not well understood, it is thought that declining activity of the aminophospholipid translocase and calcium-mediated, nonspecific flip-flop of phospholipids play a role. As previous studies in the erythrocyte ghost have shown that polyamines can alter flip-flop of phospholipids, we asked whether alterations in cellular polyamines in intact cells undergoing apoptosis would affect PS appearance, either by altering aminophospholipid translocase activity or phospholipid flip-flop. Cells of the human leukemic cell line, HL-60, were incubated with or without the ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor, difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), and induced to undergo apoptosis by ultraviolet irradiation. Whereas DFMO treatment resulted in profound depletion of putrescine and spermidine (but not spermine), it had no effect on caspase activity, DNA fragmentation, or plasma membrane vesiculation, typical characteristics of apoptosis. Notably, DFMO treatment prior to ultraviolet irradiation did not alter the decline in PS inward movement by the aminophospholipid translocase as measured by the uptake of 6-[(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)aminocaproyl] (NBD)-labeled PS detected in the flow cytometer. Conversely, the appearance of endogenous PS in the plasma membrane outer leaflet detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled annexin V and enhanced phospholipid flip-flop detected by the uptake of 1-palmitoyl-1-[6-[(7-nitro-2–1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)aminocaproyl]-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (NBD-PC) seen during apoptosis were significantly inhibited by prior DFMO treatment. Importantly, replenishment of spermidine, by treatment with exogenous putrescine to bypass the metabolic blockade by DFMO, restored both enhanced phospholipid flip-flop and appearance of PS during apoptosis. Such restoration was seen even in the presence of cycloheximide but was not seen when polyamines were added externally just prior to assay. Taken together, these data show that intracellular polyamines can modulate PS appearance resulting from nonspecific flip-flop of phospholipids across the plasma membrane during apoptosis. During apoptosis, phosphatidylserine (PS) is moved from the plasma membrane inner leaflet to the outer leaflet where it triggers recognition and phagocytosis of the apoptotic cell.

Additionally, the anionic phospholipid phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate may play a role (27Sulpice J.-C. Zachowski A. Devaux P.F. Giraud F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6347-6354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Sulpice J.-C. Moreau C. Devaux P.F. Zachowski A. Giraud F.

Zachowski A. Giraud F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13345-13352Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), exogenously added polyamines, particularly spermine, have been shown to antagonize calcium-induced nonspecific phospholipid flip-flop. These observations in simplified models of phospholipid flip-flop, prompted us to ask whether polyamines in intact cells might govern the phospholipid flip-flop seen during apoptosis. By using the ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor, DFMO, to disrupt polyamine biosynthesis, we tested each of the processes involved in transbilayer movement of phospholipids during cellular apoptosis. As the data show, DFMO treatment of HL-60s resulted in characteristic progressive depletion of intracellular spermidine and putrescine, with sparing of spermine levels. Whereas polyamine depletion with DFMO did not alter the decline in aminophospholipid translocase activity, inhibition of PS appearance and phospholipid flip-flop was demonstrated with alterations in intracellular polyamines during apoptosis. Significantly, alteration in polyamine levels in DFMO-treated cells inhibited only the events previously shown to require extracellular calcium (8Bratton D.L. Fadok V.A. Richter D.A. Kailey J.M. Guthrie L.A. Henson P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26159-26165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). DFMO treatment had no effect on calcium mobilization, scramblase or Bcl-2 expression, caspase or transglutaminase activity, plasma membrane vesiculation, or DNA fragmentation. Importantly, repletion of spermidine levels by the addition of putrescine to cell cultures restored phospholipid flip-flop and the appearance of PS in the plasma membrane outer leaflet during apoptosis. This restoration required intracellular repletion of spermidine, as external addition of the various polyamines did not restore PS appearance or phospholipid flip-flop. These findings demonstrate that phospholipid flip-flop with resulting PS appearance is dissociable from other events of apoptosis and can be governed by cellular polyamines. phosphatidylserine 2-(difluoromethyl)-dl-ornithine monohydrochloride monohydrate fluorescein isothiocyanate 1-palmitoyl-1-[6-[(7-nitro-2–1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl]aminocaproyl]-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine HEPES-buffered saline bovine serum albumin polymerase chain reaction 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic PBS, phosphate-buffered saline 7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin The human leukemia cell line HL-60 was obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD) and cultured in RPMI 1640 (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gemini Biological Products, Inc., Calabasas, CA) and maintained in the undifferentiated state at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, humidified atmosphere. For polyamine depletion experiments, HL-60 cells were plated at a cell density of 1.25 × 105 cells/ml in RPMI with 20% fetal calf serum and treated with 1 mm DFMO ((2-(difluoromethyl)-dl-ornithine monohydrochloride monohydrate), a generous gift of Dr. Ekkehard Böhme, Hoechst-Roussel, Cincinnati, OH) and incubated 120 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. Reconstitution of polyamines was accomplished by the addition of putrescine in RPMI at a final concentration of 10 μm at 72 and 96 h post-seeding. Control cells were seeded at 6.25 × 104cells/ml to accommodate a faster growth rate and were incubated under identical conditions at the same time as the DFMO-treated cells. All cultures were harvested while at approximately 1–1.5 × 106 cells/ml. In experiments in which protein synthesis was inhibited by cycloheximide, the inhibitor was added at a final concentration of 0.5 μg/ml concurrently with the initial addition of putrescine. The cells were then incubated approximately 20 h before harvesting. This concentration and incubation period was shown to be sufficient to stop most of protein synthesis as determined by a 75% reduction in [35S]Cys incorporation but which resulted in less than 10% cell death as determined by trypan blue staining. Cells were pelleted, resuspended in RPMI 1640 (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) supplemented with 0.25% BSA, with or without 5 μm cytochalasin D (see below) at 2 × 106 cells/ml, and plated in 6- or 12-well plates. Apoptosis was induced by UV irradiation at 254 nm for 5 min, and the cells were then incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere for 2 h to allow the apoptotic phenotypes to develop (8Bratton D.L. Fadok V.A. Richter D.A. Kailey J.M. Guthrie L.A. Henson P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26159-26165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). At the end of the incubation period, cell cultures were subdivided, and samples were simultaneously stained for surface phosphatidylserine (PS) and phospholipid uptake and prepared for polyamine analysis and DNA fragmentation (see below). Where noted, polyamines were added externally to assess the effect on PS appearance and phospholipid flip-flop. In these experiments, either spermidine, putrescine, or spermine was added to a final concentration of 10 μm, 5 min before the uptake procedure commenced. The cells were maintained in the presence of the exogenous polyamines throughout the uptake procedure. Alternatively, cells were prepared as above for the determination of scramblase mRNA, scramblase or Bcl-2 Western blot, or caspase or transglutaminase activity as described below. DNA degradation was determined by the appearance of a hypodiploid fraction in permeabilized propidium iodide-stained cells as described previously (8Bratton D.L. Fadok V.A. Richter D.A. Kailey J.M. Guthrie L.A. Henson P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26159-26165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Nuclear changes were confirmed microscopically, and DNA fragmentation was identified by characteristic “laddering” in agarose gels (29Bratton D.L. Hamid Q. Boguniewicz M. Doherty D.E. Kailey J.M. Leung D.Y.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 211-218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells expressing PS in the plasma membrane outer leaflet were identified as those binding FITC-labeled annexin V using an Apoptosis Detection Kit (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) using the manufacturer's recommendations. Under control conditions, the binding of FITC-labeled annexin V to phosphatidylserine on the surface of apoptotic HL-60 cells closely correlates with the appearance of nuclear and cytoplasmic condensation by light microscopy and the appearance of hypodiploid DNA as described previously (8Bratton D.L. Fadok V.A. Richter D.A. Kailey J.M. Guthrie L.A. Henson P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26159-26165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The cells were analyzed on a Coulter XL (Miami, FL) flow cytometer, and the results were analyzed with PC-LYSYS software (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Annexin-positive cells were determined as described in the Apoptosis Kit by setting quadrants to separate viable cells from PI-permeant cells and non-apoptotic cells from those staining highly for the FITC-labeled annexin V probe. Percent of cells positive for PS appearance was determined from the cells staining greater than the control population threshold. Mean fluorescence of the PI-impermeant cells was simultaneously determined. Phospholipid uptake was carried out in HEPES-buffered saline (HBS) (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, with 1 mm CaCl2). Following the incubation period, cells were harvested, washed once, and resuspended in HBS (1 × 107 cells/ml). NBD-labeled phospholipids (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) were prepared by drying 1 μg of 1-palmitoyl-1- (6-[(7-nitro-2–1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)aminocaproyl]-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (NBD-PC) or 1 μg 1-palmitoyl-1-(6-[(7-nitro-2–1, 3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)aminocaproyl]-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine (NBD-PS) in a glass tube. The lipids were resuspended in 0.25% BSA with 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in HBS to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml. Previous studies have shown that these NBD-labeled probe lipids are readily solubilized in aqueous media containing 0.25% albumin and will partition into the plasma membrane outer leaflet (7Verhoven B. Schlegel R.A. Williamson P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1597-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 12Bratton D.L. J. Biol.

The cells (5 × 105 in 50 μl) were incubated with 1 μl of the lipid suspension and 5 μl of 50 mg/ml propidium iodide for 10 min at room temperature. Albumin extraction of the plasma membrane outer leaflet to remove probe lipid that had not entered the cell was performed (7Verhoven B. Schlegel R.A. Williamson P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1597-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 12Bratton D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3364-3373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Bratton D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22517-22523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with 50 μl of 1% BSA in HBS for an additional 5 min. The samples were diluted with 900 μl of ice-cold HBS, transferred to an ice bath, and analyzed in the cytofluorograph within 2 h. Early experiments demonstrated that the signal from the cell-associated lipid is stable during this time frame. The mean fluorescence values of the phospholipid uptakes were determined by setting quadrants in such a manner as to separate cells staining positively for propidium iodide (dead or highly permeant cells) from viable cell populations. As in previous studies (4Sune A. Bette-Bobillo P. Bienvenüe A. Fellmann P. Devaux P.F. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2972-2978Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 6Zachowski A. Favre E. Cribier S. Hervé P. Devaux P.F. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2585-2590Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), NBD-PS was taken up quickly and was largely unavailable for albumin extraction in control cells, as is characteristic of cells demonstrating aminophospholipid translocase activity. In contrast to the uptake of NBD-PS, the uptake of NBD-PC, a lipid probe not transported by the aminophospholipid translocase was used as a marker for “nonspecific” transbilayer movement of phospholipids that we and others (8Bratton D.L.

During apoptosis, uptake of NBD-PS declines and NBD-PC increases as has been described previously (7Verhoven B. Schlegel R.A. Williamson P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1597-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 8Bratton D.L. Fadok V.A. Richter D.A. Kailey J.M. Guthrie L.A. Henson P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26159-26165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Metabolism of the NBD-labeled probes did not occur during the incubation as demonstrated by TLC of cellular lipids extracted by the acidified Bligh and Dyer method used previously (13Bratton D.L. Dreyer E. Kailey J.M. Fadok V.A. Clay K.L. Henson P.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 514-523PubMed Google Scholar). In initial experiments, cells were incubated with NBD-labeled sphingomyelin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) to measure endocytosis during apoptosis, as it is thought that this lipid is internalized by the endocytic route rather than by transbilayer flip-flop (31Kok J.W. Babia T. Klappe K. Hoekstra D. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 905-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For all conditions of incubation, we saw no evidence for enhanced uptake of NBD-SM. Additionally, endocytosis is inhibited by cytochalasin D. This agent was used to rule out further a role for endocytosis in the uptake of the probe lipids. The presence of cytochalasin D (5 μg/ml) (Sigma) during incubation did not alter the uptake of either NBD-PC or NBD-PS and so was omitted except where noted. Thus, having ruled out a role for endocytosis of the lipid probes, NBD-labeled PS and PC uptake was used as a measure of transbilayer phospholipid movement, either via aminophospholipid translocase (NBD-PS) or nonspecific flip-flop (NBD-PC), respectively (7Verhoven B. Schlegel R.A. Williamson P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1597-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 12Bratton D.L. J. Biol.

At the end of the incubation period the HL-60s (1 × 106 cells in 0.5 ml) were separated from media by centrifugation, washed once in PBS, and resuspended in 300 μl of perchloric acid (5%). After incubation of the samples on ice for 1 h, samples were either derivatized immediately or frozen (−20 °C) until needed. Polyamines were quantified by reverse phase-high pressure liquid chromatography following dansyl chloride derivatization and precolumn clean up as previously published (13Bratton D.L. Dreyer E. Kailey J.M. Fadok V.A. Clay K.L. Henson P.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 514-523PubMed Google Scholar). Phospholipid analysis was accomplished by lipid extraction of 107 cells utilizing an acidified Bligh and Dyer extraction (13Bratton D.L. Dreyer E. Kailey J.M. Fadok V.A. Clay K.L. Henson P.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 514-523PubMed Google Scholar). The extracts were then dried under nitrogen and resuspended in isopropyl alcohol, hexane, 0.2% ammonium acetate, pH 7.0, at a ratio of 58:40:2 (solvent A). The lipid classes were separated on a 5-μm silica analytical column (Lichrosorb; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) utilizing a gradient running from 37.5 to 100% solvent B (isopropyl alcohol, hexane, 0.2% ammonium acetate, pH 7.0, at a ratio of 50:40:10) over a 20-min period at 1 ml/min. The lipid peaks were then collected and pooled representing the phosphatidylethanolamine-phosphatidylinositol, the phosphatidylserine, and the phosphatidylcholine peaks. Phosphorus analysis was then done on the pooled fractions utilizing the phosphorus assay of Gerlach and Deuticke. (32Gerlach E. Deuticke B. Biochem. J. 1963; 337: 477-480Google Scholar). The effect of DFMO on the ability of cells to mobilize calcium was done by the method of Lennon et al. (33Lennon S.V. Kilfeather S.A. Hallett M.B. Campbell A.K. Cotter T.G. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1992; 87: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) using fura-2-acetoxymethyl ester. To determine the relative amounts of scramblase transcript in the cells after the various treatments, mRNA was quantified using Advantage RT-for-PCR Kit and PCR-MIMIC kit (both fromCLONTECH Laboratories Inc., Palo Alto, CA). Briefly, cells were lysed and mRNA isolated using Trizol total RNA isolation reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). mRNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using the Advantage RT-for-PCR kit. Determination of scramblase mRNA quantity was done using competitive PCR of the cDNA against a mimic DNA fragment constructed with sequences complementary to the scramblase-specific primers. These primers were 5′-GACAGCATTCCAAGGACCTCCAGGATA-3′ and 5′-GCCTCTCTCAAAATTCCAGTCCAGTGC-3′ which would be expected to produce a DNA fragment corresponding to bases 59–787 of the scramblase sequence, a fragment 729 bases long. Mimic DNA fragment primers were 5′-GACAGCATTCCAAGGACCTCCAGGATACGCAAGTGAAATCTCCTCCG-3′ and 5′-GCCTCTCTCAAAATTCCAGTCCAGTGCATTTGATTCTGGACCATGGC-3′ resulting in a fragment of 560 bases. The mimic DNA fragment was quantified and diluted to known concentrations. PCR was set up initially with the mimic DNA fragment at 1:10 dilutions and constant amounts of the cDNA. After PCR, the samples were run out on a 1% agarose gel, and concentration of the mimic DNA fragment which resulted in bands of approximately equal intensity was determined. To determine more accurately scramblase mRNA concentration, a second dilution series of the mimic DNA fragment was made from the next highest dilution relative to the one that produced bands of equal intensity. This 1:2 dilution series was then also amplified, and again the mimic DNA fragment concentration giving equivalent band intensity was determined. This dilution corresponded to an amount of mimic DNA fragment equal to the amount of scramblase cDNA and therefore the amount of scramblase mRNA in the initial preparation. Intracellular caspase activity was determined utilizing the caspase substrateN-carbobenzyloxy-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-(7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (Enzyme Systems Products, Livermore, CA) which is a general substrate used to measure the activity of caspases 3, 6, 7, 8, and 10.

The primer grip region (residues 227–235) correctly positions the 3′-ends of primers. Point mutations were created by alanine substitution at positions 224–235. Error frequencies were measured by extension of a dG:dA primer-template mismatch. Mutants E224A, P225A, P226A, L228A, and E233A were approximately equal to the wild type in their ability to extend the mismatch. Mutants F227A, W229A, M230A, G231A, and Y232A extended 40, 66, 54, 72, and 76% less efficiently past a dG:dA mismatch compared with the wild type. We also examined the misinsertion rates of dG, dC, or dA across from a DNA template dA using RT mutants F227A and W229A. Mutant W229A exhibited high fidelity and did not produce a dG:dA or dC:dA mismatch. Interestingly, mutant F227A displayed high fidelity for dG:dA and dC:dA mismatches but low fidelity for dA:dA misinsertions. This indicates that F227A discriminates against particular base substitutions. However, a primer extension assay with three dNTPs showed that F227A generally displays higher fidelity than the wild type RT. Clearly, primer grip mutations can improve or worsen either the overall or base-specific fidelity of HIV-RT. We hypothesize that wild type RT has evolved to a fidelity that allows genetic variation without compromising yield of viable viruses.

RT contributes to the generation of sequence diversity, partly because it produces frequent replication errors. One reason for its low fidelity is that RT lacks a 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity (15Roberts J.D. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1171-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). DNA polymerases in other organisms generally have this activity, which removes incorrectly added nucleotides by recognizing the mismatched base with the template sequence. RT misincorporates nucleotides at an estimated frequency of 1 per 5000 polymerized and extends mismatched termini at varying efficiencies (4Ji J. Loeb L.A.

This proclivity for mutations by RT helps HIV to evade immune responses and drug treatment. human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase nucleotide human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase nucleotide HIV-1 RT is a heterodimer composed of p66 and p51 subunits. The p66 subunit contains both the polymerase and RNase H active sites. The p51 subunit is a proteolytic product of p66 lacking the 15-kDa carboxyl-terminal (RNase H) domain (30Wang J. Smerdon S.J.

Crystallographic studies have shown that the p51 folds into a different conformation than the p66, which prevents the p51 from having functional polymerase activity (31Arnold E. Jacobo-Molina A.

In the native RT structure, the p66 folds into a conformation that resembles a right hand. The subdomains of this subunit are referred to as fingers, palm, thumb, connection, and RNase H. The polymerase active site resides on the palm subdomain within conserved residues Asp-185, Asp-186, and Asp-110 (31Arnold E. Jacobo-Molina A. Nanni R.G. Williams R.L. Lu X. Ding J. Clark Jr., A.D.

The 3′-end of the primer is positioned near this active site within conserved residues 224–235 on the β11b loop and β12 and β13 hairpin of the RT molecule. Residues 227–235 are referred to as the primer grip region (33Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Nanni R.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Lu X. Tantillo C. Williams R.L. Kamer G. Ferris A.L. Clark P. Hizi A. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6320-6324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). One striking feature of this region is that residues Phe-227, Trp-229, and Leu-234 line the binding pocket for non-nucleoside RT inhibitors, yet no drug-resistant mutations occur at these sites (36Smerdon S.J. Jager J. Wang J. Kohlstaedt L.A. Chirino A.J. Friedman J.M. Rice P.A. Steitz T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3911-3915Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). This attests to the importance of these amino acids for polymerase function. Recent analyses of amino acid substitutions have shown the primer grip region to influence many different RT functions.

Also, residues 226, 227, 229, 230, 231, 233, and 235 are involved in proper positioning of RT for extension and processing of the polypurine tract primer (40Powell M.D. Ghosh M. Jacques P.S.

RNA-primed minus strand synthesis from the primer binding site is reduced or eliminated by mutations in residues 226, 227, 229, 231, 232, and 235 (41Wohrl B.M. Krebs R. Thrall S.H. Le Grice S.F.J.

From these results, several groups have proposed that alterations in the primer grip region affect RNA versus DNA-primed synthesis differently (37Ghosh M. Jacques P.S. Rodgers D.W. Ottmann M.

Mutations P226A, F227A, L228A, M230A, G231A, Y232A, E233A, and H235A had reduced RNase H activity for the specific cleavage involved in the removal of the polypurine tract (38Ghosh M. Williams J.

This group found that mutation D76R increases overall fidelity. Also, some nucleoside analogue-resistant mutations of RT, such as E89G, L74V, and K65R, which affect primer-template interactions and dNTP binding, display higher fidelity than wild type enzyme (47Arts E.J.

Based on these observations, we examined the role of the primer grip region in determining the fidelity of RT by using alanine-scanning mutagenesis of each residue (42Jacques P.S. Wohrl B.M. Ottmann M. Darlix J.L. Le Grice S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26472-26478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We measured mismatch extension capacity for each mutation and base substitution efficiencies for mutations F227A and W229A. Our results showed that a number of residues in this region affect fidelity, and each residue alters error rates in a different manner. We conclude that alterations in the ability of the RT to position a primer influence fidelity. Since single amino acid changes can readily improve or worsen fidelity, we suggest that the intermediate fidelity of the wild type RT provides an evolutionary advantage. T4 polynucleotide kinase, dNTPs, alkaline phosphatase, and spin gel filtration columns were purchased form Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Radiolabeled nucleotides were from NEN Life Science Products, and oligonucleotides were purchased from Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc. The individual substitution of p66 residues Glu-224 to His-235 by alanine was performed by using BcgI cassette mutagenesis as described previously (42Jacques P.S. Wohrl B.M. Ottmann M. Darlix J.L.

The mutated p66 subunit was expressed separately from the p51 subunit with a six-residue histidine tag (His6-p51). Extracts containing the primer grip mutated p66 and the His6-p51 were mixed to produce a heterodimer. The reconstituted RT was purified on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose column and by ion exchange chromatography (S-Sepharose). The purified protein was examined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (42Jacques P.S. Wohrl B.M. Ottmann M. Darlix J.L. Le Grice S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26472-26478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNA primers were synthetically generated by Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc. and were 5′-end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase. This reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and stopped by heating at 65 °C for 5 min. Excess radionucleotides were removed by spin gel filtration columns, and the primers were purified by 15% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The DNA primers were removed from the gel using an elution buffer (0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 m ammonium acetate) and resuspended in water treated with diethyl pyrocarbonate to ensure that they did not have RNase H contamination when hybridized to an RNA template. The RNA or DNA templates were annealed with the DNA primers in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, and 80 mm KCl for 10 min at 65 °C. The substrate was allowed to slow cool over 90 min. The reaction contained 2 nm substrate, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1.0 mm EDTA, 34 mm KCl, and 2 units of mutant or wild type HIV-1 RT (1 unit is equal to 4000 nmol of dTMP incorporated in poly(rA:dT)20/min/mg of protein). This was preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min to allow prebinding of the protein. The reaction was started by the addition of MgCl2 (6 mm final concentration) and 50 μm of each dNTP. Reactions were stopped after 20 min with a 2× termination dye (90% formamide, 10 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), and 0.1% each of xylene cyanole and bromphenol blue). Products were fractionated by 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the data were quantified by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Relative synthesis by the mutant versus wild type RTs was determined in the following way. The amount of synthesis past the mismatch was divided by the amount of synthesis on a correctly matched substrate. This worked out to 33% for the wild type RT when comparing substrates A and B. The percentage of synthesis past the mismatch was determined in the same way for the mutants. This standardizes the activities of the enzymes. The relative ability of wild type and mutant RTs to synthesize past the mismatch was calculated by dividing the percentages. We performed a running start experiment as described by Goodman and co-workers (54Mendelman L.V. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol.

The reactions contained 20 nm substrate, 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1.0 mmEDTA, 34 mm KCl, and 50 ng of mutant or wild type HIV-1 RT. The substrate was incubated for 5 min to allow the enzyme to prebind. The reactions were started with 6 mm MgCl2 and varying concentrations of dATP, as indicated in the figure legends. The reaction was stopped after 2 min with 2× termination dye. Reactions were performed as in the running start experiment with some exceptions. The reactions were started with 6 mm of MgCl2 and varying concentrations of dTTP, dATP, dGTP, or dCTP (4, 3, 2, 1, 0.5, 0.1, and 0.05 mm). Mutant W229A required a 15-min reaction in order to obtain a 20% extension from the DNA primer. The products were fractionated by 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the data were quantified by PhosphorImager analysis. Equations used to determine the fidelity of the mutants and wild type RT are based on Goodman's fidelity assays and obey Michaelis-Menten kinetics (54Mendelman L.V. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol.

Vpol=Vmax[dNTP]Km+[dNTP] In the Michaelis-Menton equation, Vpol is defined as the rate of addition of nucleotides to the primer. This is an important factor to measure in a fidelity determination, because it allows a comparison of rates of polymerization for incorrectversus correct nucleotides. To determineVpol in these experiments, we used a method developed by Goodman and colleagues (54Mendelman L.V. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol.

A Lineweaver-Burk graph of 1/Vpol versus 1/[dNTP] was plotted to obtain theVmax and Km values for the insertion of the incorrect or correct nucleotide used in this experiment. These values were used to calculate the frequency of insertion, which is a ratio of incorrect to correct insertions as follows. fins=(Vmax/Km)w(Vmax/Km)RThe fidelity of these enzymes was obtained as the reciprocal of the frequency of insertion (31Arnold E.

These reactions contained a 63-nt DNA template annealed to a 32P-labeled 14-nt DNA primer at a ratio of 2.5:1 template to primer. The 20 μl assay mixture contained 100 nm template-primer, three or four dNTPs at 250 μm each, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 40 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmMgCl2, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Wild type RT, F227A, and W229A were added in four different quantities (wild type: 0.05, 0.5, 5, and 50 ng; F227A and W229A: 25, 50, 100, and 200 ng). The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min, and the reactions were terminated with 2× termination dye. The reactions were analyzed on denaturing 15% polyacrylamide gels. The primer grip region of RT correctly positions the polymerase active site to the 3′-end of the primer for synthesis (32Kohlstaedt L.A. Wang J. Friedman J.M. Rice P.A. Steitz T.A.

We anticipated that mutations in this region would distort primer positioning in a way that could alter the choice of nucleotides added to the primer terminus. If the active site of the wild type RT were optimized for fidelity, we would expect all mutations to be neutral or decrease fidelity. The primer grip mutant RTs were generated by site-directed mutagenesis and purified essentially to homogeneity as indicated under “Methods.” Substrates A and B were used to compare DNA synthesis by the wild type and mutant RTs (Fig.1 A). Substrate A consists of a DNA primer correctly matched to a DNA template, whereas substrate B has a DNA primer hybridized to the same DNA template except with a dG:dA mismatch at the 3′ terminus of the primer. The DNA primers were radiolabeled at the 5′-end, and extension of these primers produced a 40-nucleotide full-length product (Fig.2).

Studies of the dissociation and reassembly ofLumbricus terrestris Hb have provided ample evidence for the presence of a ∼200-kDa linker-free subassembly consisting of monomer (M) and disulfide-bonded trimer (T) subunits. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) of the subassemblies obtained by gel filtration of partially dissociated L. terrestris andArenicola marina Hbs showed the presence of noncovalent complexes of M and T subunits with masses in the 213.3–215.4 and 204.6–205.6 kDa ranges, respectively. The observed mass of theL. terrestris subassembly decreased linearly with an increase in de-clustering voltage from ∼215,400 Da at 60 V to ∼213,300 Da at 200 V. In contrast, the mass of the A. marina complex decreased linearly from 60 to 120 V and reached an asymptote at ∼204,600 Da (180–200 V). The decrease in mass was probably due to the progressive removal of complexed water and alkali metal cations. ESI-MS at an acidic pH showed both subassemblies to consist of only M and T subunits, and the experimental masses demonstrated them to have the composition M3T3. Because there are three isoforms of M and four isoforms of T inLumbricus and two isoforms of M and 5 isoforms of T inArenicola, the masses of the M3T3subassemblies are not unique. A random assembly model was used to calculate the mass distributions of the subassemblies, using the known ESI-MS masses and relative intensities of the M and T subunit isforms.

The most extensively studied complex is the Hb from the common earthworm Lumbricus terrestris. Based on the finding of a ∼200-kDa globin subassembly upon mild, partial dissociation of the Hb at neutral pH, a “bracelet” model of its quaternary structure was proposed to consist of twelve ∼200-kDa globin subassemblies attached to a central scaffolding of 36–42 linker chains (24–32 kDa) (5Vinogradov S.N.

Based on these results, a Hb model was proposed consisting of 12 hexadecamer subassemblies and 24 linker chains. A key point in resolving the differences is a reliable mass for the globin subassembly.

The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min, and the absorbance of the eluate was monitored at 280 nm. The concentrations of the Hb and the globin subassembly were determined from the absorbance of the cyanmet forms at 540 nm using the extinction coefficients 0.442 and 0.656 ml·mg−1·cm−1, respectively (12Zal F.

Sample solutions in 10 mm ammonium acetate were introduced at 4 μl/min into the ESI source of either a Quattro LCZ, a tandem quadrupole instrument whose m/z range was specially extended to 8000, or a quadrupole time-of-flight instrument (Q-Tof) (Micromass UK Ltd., Wythenshawe, Manchester, United Kingdom) with am/z range of 14,000. Data were accumulated over 5–10 min. Mass scale calibration used the Cs(n+1)In+ ions from separate introductions of a solution of CsI (1 mg/ml) in 50% aqueous acetonitrile. The protein samples were diluted to a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in high pressure liquid chromatography-grade water and desalted by manually shaking 200 μl of each solution for about 1 min with ∼3 mg of previously washed mixed-bed ion exchange resin beads (Type AG 501-X8; Bio-Rad), and ammonium acetate was added to a concentration of 10 mm. The multiply charged data produced by the mass spectrometer on the m/z scale were converted to the mass (molecular weight) scale using either Maximum Entropy-based software (27Ferrige A.G.

Three sets of peaks were observed: (a) one set of peaks corresponding to the intact subassembly with charge states ranging from 29+ to 38+, with the 34+ and 35+ states being the most abundant; and (b) two other sets of peaks corresponding to the two subunits comprising the subassembly, i.e. the ∼55-kDa trimer T with charge states ranging from 14+ to 18+ and the ∼17-kDa monomer M with charge states ranging from 6+ to 9+, respectively.

The gel filtration elution profile of partially dissociated Arenicola Hb at a neutral pH was very similar to the elution profile obtained withLumbricus Hb by a variety of means (5Vinogradov S.N.

Fig.2 A presents the ESIm/z spectrum of the Arenicola Hb subassembly obtained at neutral pH on the extendedm/z range quadrupole instrument. The noncovalent complex is observed with charge states similar to those ofLumbricus (Fig. 1), but it is the dominant species in this case, with almost insignificant levels of M and T, suggesting that theArenicola subassembly is more stable under ESI-MS conditions than that of Lumbricus. The inset in Fig.2 A shows the result of deconvoluting the rawm/z data by MaxEnt and exhibits a principal peak at 204,753 Da with a much smaller subsidiary peak at 205,308 Da. Fig.2 B shows the ESI m/z spectrum of theArenicola Hb subassembly obtained under the same mass spectrometer conditions as described for Fig. 2 A but with the pH value reduced to pH 3.5. Approximately half of the complex was dissociated into its constituent M and T subunits existing in charge states similar to those observed in the case of Lumbricus(Fig. 1). It was found that the addition of ammonium acetate to the sample solutions was essential in order to observe the subassembly at adequate sensitivity, with an optimum concentration of 10 mm. Thorough desalting using the ion exchange beads was also necessary, otherwise the peaks were significantly broader, presumably due to the multiple addition of alkali metal ions, mainly Na+. Although these latter ligands could not be directly observed in the subassembly, they were distinguishable in association with the monomer and were significantly reduced after desalting but were not completely eliminated. It was also found that the measured masses of the subassemblies depended to some extent (<1%) on the amount of de-clustering voltage applied to the ions. De-clustering occurs when the ions are accelerated through a region that is intermediate in pressure between their generation at atmospheric pressure and analysis under high vacuum. This acceleration by a potential across the intermediate pressure region has the effect of imparting internal energy to the ions by collisions with the nitrogen gas in this region, causing them to lose weakly bound ligands at low potentials, followed by more strongly bound ligands as the potential is increased. Thus, at low de-clustering potentials, the mass tends to be higher than at high potentials. Fig.3 shows a series of mass spectra obtained on the time-of-flight instrument for the Lumbricus (Fig.3 A) and Arenicola (Fig. 3 B) subassemblies that illustrate the way in which the mass and appearance of the subassembly peaks change with the de-clustering voltage. Although the Lumbricus subassembly mass decreased linearly from ∼215,400 Da at 60 V to ∼213,300 Da at 200 V, the mass of theArenicola subassembly decreased linearly from ∼205,570 at 60 V to ∼205,100 at 120 V and then tended toward an asymptote at ∼204,600 Da in the range 180–200 V. In addition, above about 140 V, a series of peaks appeared below the major peak that can be attributed to the loss of up to three heme groups. In the case ofLumbricus, discrete peaks corresponding to the loss of heme groups were not observed, although above 140 V, there is an obvious broadening of the peak on the low mass side of its maximum. Also, the heme group itself (m/z 616.5) was observed to appear in the spectra from both samples at about 120 V and then increased in intensity at higher voltage. The decrease in mass with increasing de-clustering voltage is most likely due to the loss of complexed water molecules and possibly some cations. The inability to observe the distinct loss of heme groups in the case ofLumbricus could be due in part to the heterogeneity of the components composing the subassembly, which is substantially greater than is the case with Arenicola. Lumbricus Hb contains four globin chains (chains a—d) ranging in mass from 15,962 to 19,390 Da, with the monomer subunit (chain d) existing as three isoforms (d1–d3), and chain a occurring as four glycosylated isoforms (a1–a4); the latter form four different disulfide-bonded trimer subunits with chains b and c (8Martin P.D. Kuchumov A.R. Green B.N. Oliver R.W.A. Braswell E.H. Wall J.S. Vinogradov S.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 154-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).Arenicola Hb contains eight different globin chains (a1, a2, b1, b2, b3, c, d1, and d2) ranging in mass from 15,922 to 17,032 Da, with the b, c, and d chains forming five of the six possible disulfide-bonded trimers (T1–T5) (c + b1 + d1, c + b1 + d2, c + b2 + d1, c + b2 + d2, and c + b3 + d2) (12Zal F.

TableI shows the range of masses observed for the two subassemblies and the selected representative masses together with the calculated masses for dodecamer subassembly compositions M9T, M6T2, and M3T3 and a hexadecamer subassembly M4T4 using the globin chain and subunit masses determined previously (8Martin P.D.

For the Lumbricus Hb subassembly, the mass 214,190 Da at a de-clustering voltage of 140 V was taken to be representative, assuming a behavior similar to that of the Arenicola Hb subassembly, which displays minimal heme loss at this voltage. For the Arenicola Hb subassembly, the asymptotic mass 204,600 Da was taken to be representative. The results shown in Table I demonstrate unequivocally that the M3T3 subassembly compositions provide the best agreement between the calculated masses and the experimental masses, even though the latter are somewhat higher, depending on the de-clustering voltage used. Although adduct formation with alkali metal cations cannot be excluded, the mass differences can be ascribed to noncovalent complexation of Lumbricus andArenicola subassemblies with approximately 42 and 14 water molecules, respectively. It is now known that water molecules play an important role in the formation of biomolecular complexes (29Ladbury J.E. Chem.

Furthermore, recent ESI-MS studies of complexes formed between SH2 domains from tyrosine kinase Src with tyrosyl phosphopeptides (30Chung E. Henriques D. Renzoni D. Zvelebil M. Bradshaw J.M.

Open table in a new tab An additional and very important point that needs to be considered in comparing the experimental masses of the subassemblies with the masses calculated from their subunits is the fact that these subassemblies do not have a unique mass. Because each dodecamer subassembly consists of three monomers and three trimers, there are essentially two levels of mass distribution: (a) one for each of the two subunits; and (b) another for their combination into a dodecamer. In the case of the Lumbricus Hb subassembly, there are 10 possible ways of forming three monomers from three different chains (d1–d3), and the four different trimers (chains b and c with each of chains a1–a4) provide 20 possible combinations of three trimers; thus, the total number of possible dodecamer subassemblies (i.e. 3M and 3T) is 200. For the Arenicola Hb subassembly, there are 4 possible combinations of 3M from two different monomers (chains a1 and a2) and 35 possible combinations of 3T from five different trimers, leading to 140 possible M3T3 subassemblies. Because the proportions of the subunit isoforms are known experimentally from previous ESI-MS studies (8Martin P.D. Kuchumov A.R. Green B.N. Oliver R.W.A. Braswell E.H. Wall J.S. Vinogradov S.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 154-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 12Zal F. Green B.N. Lallier F.H. Vinogradov S.N. Toulmond A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), it is possible to calculate a mass distribution based on a straightforward combinatorial model (see “Appendix”). The calculated histograms for the subassembly masses of the two Hbs incorporating only masses with a probability ≥ 0.002 are shown in Fig.4. The calculated mass range for theLumbricus Hb subassembly (212,624–214,176 Da) is much greater than that for the Arenicola Hb subassembly (203,934–204,495 Da) (Table I). The subassembly masses with the highest probability are 213,512 Da for Lumbricus and 204,375 and 204,425 Da for Arenicola. The expected masses of the randomly assembled subassemblies are 213,436 Da (S.D. = 319 Da) and 204,342 Da (S.D. = 80 Da), respectively. The substantially broader mass distribution of the Lumbricus Hb subassembly as compared with that of the Arenicola Hb subassembly may be a contributing factor to the greater uncertainty in the observed mass of the former. It is appropriate at this point to briefly discuss the disagreement concerning the structure of Lumbricus Hb between our group and that of A. F. Riggs that has persisted for over a decade. In 1991, Fushitani and Riggs reassembled at a neutral pH the trimer and monomer subunits isolated by dissociation of the Hb at pH > 9, observed a 5.8 S species using sedimentation velocity, and suggested it to be an octamer globin complex M2T2. In subsequent experiments, the CO forms of the trimer and monomer subunits isolated by dissociation at an alkaline pH were mixed at a neutral pH to obtain a subassembly with a mass of ∼280 kDa as determined by multiple angle laser light scattering, in agreement with a mass of 286 kDa calculated for a hexadecamer [M]4[T]4 (22Ownby D.W.

Based on a weight proportion of linker chains of 0.163, Riggs and his colleagues have proposed a model ofLumbricus Hb comprising 12 hexadecamers [d]4[abc]4 (192 globin chains) and 24 linkers, with a calculated mass in agreement with the 4.1 ± 0.1 MDa mass for the native Hb determined only by multiple angle laser light scattering (22Ownby D.W.

Apart from the fact that the proposed globin to linker stoichiometry corresponds to iron and heme contents that are higher than those generally observed for over 30 HBL Hbs by many different investigators (4Lamy J.N.

Physiol. 1991; 98B: 187-194Google Scholar), the most telling shortcoming of this model is that the proposed hexadecamer subassembly cannot have a 3-fold symmetry and is thus unable to account for the 12 local 3-fold axes observed in the three-dimensional reconstructions based on cryoelectron microscopy images in frozen, hydrated samples of Lumbricus Hb obtained by the groups of Van Heel and colleagues (16Schatz M.

Our findings, which are summarized in Table I, do not provide any support for the Riggs model of the globin subassembly. It should be pointed out that the three-dimensional reconstructions obtained by De Haas et al. for the chlorocruorin fromEudistylia vancouverii (17De Haas F. Taveau J.-C. Boisset N. Lambert O.

Hence, it is likely that the dodecamer subassembly demonstrated to occur in the Hbs fromLumbricus and the marine polychaete Arenicolaalso occurs in other HBL Hbs, including chlorocruorins. This proposal is supported by the good agreement between the available experimental masses and the masses calculated for our model consisting of 12 dodecamer subassemblies and 36 or 42 linkers using the accurate masses obtained by ESI-MS of the HBL Hbs (9Weber R.E.

The M subunit consists of chains d1–d3, and the T subunits are comprised of chains b and c and one of the four a1–a4 chains. Previous ESI-MS studies have established that the relative proportions of the three M chains are d1:d2:d3 = 0.55:0.28:0.17, and the proportions of the four a chains of T subunits are a1:a2:a3:a4 = 0.24:0.40:0.08:0.28 (8Martin P.D.

We assume that the M and T subunits are incorporated into the subassembly independently of each other. Let D = (D1, D2, D3) be the vector of random numbers of d1–d3 monomers contained in the subassembly. D1–D3 are nonnegative integer-valued random variables subject to the restriction that D1 + D2 + D3 = 3. The random vector D takes 10 values corresponding to the following combinations: 3d1, 3d2, 3d3, 2d1d2, 2d2d1, 2d1d3, 2d3d1, 2d2d3, 2d3d2, and d1d2d3. It follows from our assumption that the random vector D has a multinomial distribution B(3; p(d1), p(d2), p(d3)), that is: p(δ)=Pr(D=δ)=3!p(d1)δ1p(d2)δ2p(d3)δ3/(δ1!δ2!δ3!)(Eq. 1) where δ = (δ1, δ2, δ3) is a vector of nonnegative integers such that δ1 + δ2 + δ3 = 3 (31Fabris D. Fenselau C. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 384-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Similarly, let T = (T1, T2, T3, T4) be the vector of random numbers of trimers (t1–t4) contained in a dodecamer subassembly. T1-T4 are nonnegative integer-valued random variables such that T1 + T2 + T3 + T4 = 3. The random vector T takes 20 values that correspond to the following combinations of trimer subunits in a dodecamer: 3t1, 3t2, 3t3, 3t4, 2t1t2, 2t2t1, 2t1t3, 2t3t1, 2t1t4, 2t4t1, 2t2t3, 2t3t2, 2t2t4, 2t4t2, 2t3t4, 2t4t3, t1t2t3, t1t2t4, t1t3t4, and t2t3t4. Likewise, the random vector T has a multinomial distribution B(3; p(a1), p (a2), p(a3), p(a4)), that is: p(τ)=Pr(T=τ)=3!p(a1)τ1p(a2)τ2p(a3)τ3p(a4)τ4/(τ1!τ2!τ3!τ4!)(Eq. 2) where τ = (τ1, τ2, τ3, τ4) is a vector of nonnegative integers such that τ1 + τ2 + τ3 + τ4 = 3. The number of different dodecamers is the product of the numbers of possible values of vectors D and T, 10 × 20 = 200; each is determined by the two integer vectors δ and τ, and the probability of its occurrence is equal to the product of probabilities given by Equations 1 and 2. The mass of a dodecamer subassembly is given by (33Taylor H.M. Karlin S. An Introduction to Stochastic Modeling. 3rd Ed.

Calculation using MAPLE (Waterloo Maple Software) (34Adams S.G. Maple Talk. Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ1997Google Scholar) showed all 200 masses to be different, varying from 212,623.8 to 214,175.7 Da. The dodecamer 2d1d2t1t2t4 has the highest probability (0.041) and a mass of 213,512 Da. The expected mass of a randomly assembled dodecamer can also be easily calculated from Equation 3. Because the random variables Diand Tj for all i = 1,2,3 and j = 1,2,3,4 follow the binomial distributions B(3, p(di)) and B(3, p(aj)), the expected total masses of monomers di and aj in a dodecamer are equal to 3 m(di)p(di) and 3 m(aj)p(aj), respectively.

IFN-α induces transcription factors, interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3), and interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), which activate interferon-inducible gene expression through binding to the interferon-stimulated regulatory element (ISRE) “AGTTTCNNTTTCNC” in the gene promoters. We found the ISRE-like sequence “AGGCTTTCACTTTCTC” in the HBV enhancer-1 region and elucidated the role of this sequence. Gel mobility shift assay showed binding ofin vitro translated IRF-1 and in vitrotranslated p48 (ISGF3-γ), which is a component of ISGF3 to this sequence. However, nuclear extracts binding to this sequence from human hepatoma cells (HuH-7) treated with IFN-α contained only the protein consisted of p48. In transfection experiments, IFN-α suppressed the HBV enhancer-1 activity, and overexpression of p48 enhanced this inhibitory effect. Both mutation and deletion of the ISRE-like sequence in the HBV enhancer-1 region reduced the suppressive effect of IFN-α. Our results suggest that the ISRE-like sequence in the HBV enhancer-1 can interact with the protein containing p48 and mediate the IFN-α-induced suppression of the enhancer activity.

Interferon-α (IFN-α) has been used as an anti-viral agent against chronic HBV infection (2Hoofnagle J.H. Di Bisceglie A.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar), resulting in improvement of clinical outcome in patients with chronic HBV infection (3Niederau C. Heintges T. Lange S. Goldmann G.

IFN-α suppresses expression of HBV gene by reducing the HBV enhancer-1 activity (4Tur-Kaspa R. Teicher L. Laub O. Dagan D. Bloom B.R. Schafritz D.A. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1821-1824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have reported previously that IFN-α in combination with tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) or interleukin-1β (IL-1β) synergistically suppress the HBV enhancer-1 activity (5Hamasaki K. Nakata K.

In addition, recent studies have shown that cytotoxic T lymphocytes, which release various cytokines, play an important role in noncytolytic clearance of HBV from hepatocytes (6Guidotti L.G. Ando K.

Type I IFN (IFN-α and -β) induces the formation of a heterotrimetric transcription factor complex, interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) (9Levy D.E. Kessler D.S. Pine R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1362-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), which consists of signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 and 2 (STAT1 and STAT2) (10Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5014) Google Scholar) and p48 (ISGF3γ) (11Veals S.A. Schindler C. Leonard D. Fu X.-Y. Aebersold R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Levy D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3315-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), after binding to its receptor. ISGF3 translocates into the nucleus and binds to the interferon-stimulated regulatory element (ISRE) in the promoter of a variety of interferon-inducible genes, and transactivates their expression (10Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5014) Google Scholar). Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) is another important factor induced by type I and II IFNs (12Miyamoto M. Fujita T. Kimura Y. Maruyama M. Harada H. Sudo Y. Miyata T. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1988; 54: 903-913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). Since the sequence of IRF-1 binding site termed IRF-E overlaps with ISRE (13Kimura T. Kadokawa Y. Harada H. Matsumoto M. Sato M. Kashiwazaki Y. Tarutani M. Tan R.S.-P. Takasugi T. Matsuyama T. Mak T.W. Noguchi S. Taniguchi T. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), IRF-1 also binds to ISRE sequence and activates the interferon-inducible gene transcription (14Reis L.F.L. Harada H. Wolchok J.D. Taniguchi T. Vilcek J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). p48 and IRF-1 show a homology within their amino-terminal regions and are members of the IRF family together with other IRFs (15Nguyen H. Hiscott J. Pitha P.M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 293-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). However, analysis in mice deficient for the p48 gene has shown that induction of some interferon-inducible genes such as 2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthetase (2′,5′-OAS) (16Shiojiri S. Fukunaga R. Ichii Y. Sokawa Y. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1986; 99: 1455-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) (17Meurs E. Chong K. Galabru J. Thomas N. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R.G. Hovanessian A.G. Cell. 1990; 62: 379-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar) are p48-dependent and that IRF-1 cannot compensate completely for the loss of p48 (13Kimura T. Kadokawa Y. Harada H. Matsumoto M. Sato M. Kashiwazaki Y. Tarutani M. Tan R.S.-P. Takasugi T. Matsuyama T. Mak T.W. Noguchi S. Taniguchi T. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), suggesting that p48 and IRF-1 are, in part, functionally different. Recent studies have demonstrated the presence of ISRE-like sequence in several viral genomes, such as Qp promoter region of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen 1 gene (18Schaefer B.C. Paulson E. Strominger J.L. Speck S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 873-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 19Nonkwelo C. Ruf I.K. Sample J. J.

Droogmans L. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5526-5534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and downstream region of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat (21Van Lint C. Amella C.A. Emiliani S. John M. Jie T. Verdin E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6113-6127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that IRF-1, but not ISGF3, interacts with these ISRE-like sequences and regulates viral gene expression (19Nonkwelo C. Ruf I.K. Sample J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6887-6897Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Kiermer V. Van Lint C. Briclet D. Vanhulle C. Kettmann R. Verdin E. Burny A. Droogmans L. J.

We also found the ISRE-like sequence in the 5′ region of the HBV enhancer-1, which is located just before the X gene promoter and enhances the transcription of not only the X gene but also the Core, Pre-S, and S gene of the HBV specifically in hepatocytes (22Su H. Yee J.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2708-2712Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In the present study, we determined whether the ISRE-like sequence in the HBV enhancer-1 could interact with p48 or IRF-1 and act as a cis-element mediating the IFN-α action. We showed that IFN-α induced a complex formation of this sequence with the protein containing p48 and that the complex formation was relevant to the IFN-α-induced suppression of the enhancer activity. This is the first report suggesting that p48, together with its partners, directly binds to HBV DNA sequence and participates in the regulation of HBV gene expression. The HuH-7 human hepatoma cell line was maintained in a chemically defined medium, IS-RPMI (23Nakabayashi H. Taketa K. Yamane T. Miyazaki M. Miyano K. Sato J. Gann. 1984; 75: 151-158PubMed Google Scholar) with 2% fetal bovine serum. In each experiment, the medium was replaced with serum-free IS-RPMI containing recombinant human IFN-α 2a (Nippon Roche Co., Tokyo, Japan), recombinant human IFN-γ 1a (Shionogi Co., Osaka, Japan), or IL-1β (Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Tokushima, Japan), then incubated for the indicated periods. The full-length human p48 (ISGF3γ) cDNA cloned into pBluescript SK(+) (11Veals S.A. Schindler C. Leonard D. Fu X.-Y. Aebersold R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Levy D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3315-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), which was kindly provided by Dr. D. E. Levy (Department of Pathology, New York University School of Medicine), was subjected to in vitro transcription and translation with TNT T7 quick-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). pUC IRF-1 and pHIRF4S-51 plasmids containing the full-length human IRF-1 and IRF-2 cDNA, respectively, were kindly provided by Dr. T. Taniguchi (Department of Immunology, Tokyo University, Tokyo, Japan). The IRF cDNAs were subcloned to pGEM 7(+) (Promega Corp.) and subjected to in vitro transcription and translation. The HuH-7 cells were treated with 1,000 IU/ml IFN-α (2 h) or 100 IU/ml IFN-γ (2 and 24 h), and the nuclear extract was prepared as described previously (24Levy D.E. Kessler D.S. Pine R. Reich N. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 383-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Anti-human p48 rabbit serum was also provided by Dr. D. E. Levy, and anti-human IRF-1 rabbit serum was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The following double-stranded oligonucleotides were used as a probe or competitor in the assays (only the sense strand is shown): HBV ISRE-like sequence (25Fujiyama A. Miyanohara A. Nozaki C. Yoneyama T. Ohtomo N. Matsubara K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 4601-4610Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), GCAGGCTTTCACTTTCTCGC; mutated HBV ISRE-like sequence (mutations are underlined), GCAGGCCCTCACCTTCTCGC; 2′5′-OAS ISRE (26Cohen B. Peretz D. Vaimain D. Benech P. Chebath J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1411-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), CTGTTGGTTTCGTTTCCTCAGA; C13 oligonucleotide (IRF-E) (27Fujita T. Sakakibara J. Sudo Y. Miyamoto M. Kimura Y. Taniguchi T. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3397-3405Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), TCTCACTTTCACTTTCACTT. The probe was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. The proteins prepared from the in vitro transcription and translation or nuclear extract were incubated with 10 fmol of the labeled probe for 30 min at 24 °C in the presence of 40 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 1 μg of salmon testes DNA, and 8% glycerol. The reaction mixture was electrophoresed on a 4% polyacrylamide gel containing 25 mm Tris borate and 0.25 mmEDTA. To construct the pXEn-CAT plasmid containing the HBV enhancer-1 and X promoter region, NsiI (937) toNcoI (1244) fragment from pBRHBadr125 (25Fujiyama A. Miyanohara A. Nozaki C. Yoneyama T. Ohtomo N. Matsubara K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 4601-4610Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) was inserted into the pCAT-basic plasmid (Promega Corp.). To construct the pXEnISRE(M)-CAT plasmid, which contains T to C substitutions in the ISRE-like sequence, the AccI (943) to StuI (985) fragment containing the ISRE-like sequence in the pXEn-CAT plasmid was replaced with double-stranded oligonucleotide with the sequence 5′-ATACAATCTAAGCAGGCCCTCACCTTCTCGCCAACTTATAAGG-3′ (mutations are underlined). To construct the pXEnΔISRE-CAT plasmid, the NsiI (937) to StuI (985) fragment containing the ISRE-like sequence was deleted from pXEn-CAT plasmid. Similarly, to construct the pX-CAT plasmid, which has only the X promoter region, the NsiI(937) to SphI (1105) fragment containing the full HBV enhancer-1 region was deleted from pXEn-CAT plasmid. The full-length IRF-1 and IRF-2 cDNAs from pUC IRF-1 and pHIRF4S-51 plasmids, respectively, were inserted into the expression vehicle, pcDNA3 (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA), to yield the IRF-1 and IRF-2 expression plasmids, pcIRF-1 and pcIRF-2, respectively. p48 expression plasmid, pcp48, was also constructed by inserting the full-length p48 cDNA into the pcDNA3. Transfection was performed using 3 μg of plasmid DNA per flask (25 cm2) by the lipofection method (28Tsutsumi T. Ido A. Nakao K. Hamasaki K. Kato Y. Ohtsuru A. Nakata K. Tamaoki T. Nagataki S. Gastroenterology. 1994; 107: 499-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two days later, cells were harvested and lysed by five cycles of freezing and thawing. The lysate was heated at 60 °C for 15 min to inactivate deacetylase, centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant was used for determination of CAT activity as described previously (29Nakao K. Miyao Y. Ohe Y. Tamaoki T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 9833-9842Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). pSV-β-galactosidase control vector (Promega Corp.) was cotransfected with CAT plasmids to correct the transfection efficacy in each experiment. The HuH-7 cells were treated with 1,000 IU/ml IFN-α or 100 IU/ml IFN-γ. Total RNA was isolated from the cells before and at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 h after treatment by the guanidium isothiocyanate method for analyzing the levels of p48 and IRF-1 mRNA using p48 and IRF-1 cDNA probe, respectively. We found the ISRE-like sequence “AGGCTTTCACTTTCTC” in the HBV enhancer-1 region at positions 958–973 (25Fujiyama A. Miyanohara A. Nozaki C. Yoneyama T. Ohtomo N. Matsubara K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 4601-4610Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), which is similar to the ISRE sequence in interferon-inducible gene promoters (26Cohen B. Peretz D. Vaimain D. Benech P. Chebath J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1411-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 30Reich N. Evans B. Levy D. Fahey D. Knight Jr., E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Moreover, the HBV ISRE-like sequence is precisely conserved among the different subtypes of HBV (25Fujiyama A. Miyanohara A. Nozaki C. Yoneyama T. Ohtomo N. Matsubara K.

Therefore, we examined whether p48 or IRF-1 could bind to this sequence by the gel mobility shift assay using a oligonucleotide probe that contained the HBV ISRE-like sequence. The in vitro translated p48 formed a complex band with the probe (Fig.1 A, lane 1). Addition of 100 times molar excess of nonlabeled 2′,5′-OAS ISRE and HBV ISRE-like oligonucleotide competitors reduced the density of the complex band (Fig. 1 A, lanes 2 and 4), but addition of nonlabeled mutated HBV ISRE-like oligonucleotide did not (Fig. 1 A, lane 5), in which T to C substitutions at key positions known to impair the ISRE function were introduced (20Kiermer V.

This interaction was also abolished by addition of 100 times molar excess of the nonlabeled C13 oligonucleotide that contains the IRF-1 binding consensus sequence (IRF-E) (13Kimura T. Kadokawa Y.

Furthermore, addition of anti-p48 serum led to a supershift of the complex band (Fig.1 B, lane 5), but addition of anti-IRF-1 did not (Fig. 1 B, lane 6), suggesting that the binding protein induced in the cells by IFN-α contained p48 but not IRF-1 in its molecule. In addition, the position of the p48-associated complex band using in vitro translated one (Fig. 1 B,lane 1) was different from that the nuclear extract from IFN-α-treated cells (Fig. 1 B, lane 3). This would account for ISGF3 formation in IFN-α-treated cells, although our work did not address whether STAT1 and STAT2 are actually involved in its complex formation. We could not detect any shifted bands corresponding to IRF-1 in this condition. The nuclear extract from HuH-7 cells treated with IFN-γ for 24 h, but not that treated with IFN-γ for 2 h, formed a complex band with the HBV ISRE-like oligonucleotide probe (Fig. 1 B, lanes 9 and10) at the similar position of the p48-associated complex band (Fig. 1 B, lane 1). Addition of anti-p48 serum led to a supershift of this complex band (Fig. 1 B,lane 11), suggesting that 24-h IFN-γ treatment induces p48 in HuH-7 cells as described previously (11Veals S.A. Schindler C. Leonard D. Fu X.-Y. Aebersold R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Levy D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3315-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 15Nguyen H. Hiscott J. Pitha P.M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 293-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). By the functional analysis of the HBV ISRE-like sequence, varying lengths of the HBV enhancer-1 and X promoter region were linked to the CAT gene (Fig. 2 A). pXEn-CAT contains the full-length of the HBV enhancer-1 and X promoter region, while pXEnISRE(M)-CAT contains three nucleotide mutations in the ISRE-like sequence as described under “Experimental Procedures.” pXEnΔISRE-CAT lacks the 48-bp region containing the ISRE-like sequence in pXEn-CAT, and pX-CAT contains only the X promoter region. These CAT plasmids were transfected into HuH-7 cells. Afterward, the cells were treated with 1,000 IU/ml IFN-α, 100 IU/ml IL-1β, or both, since at least 1,000 IU/ml IFN-α was required for an apparent suppression of the HBV enhancer-1 activity (Fig.3 A, lanes 1–5), and since we have shown previously that IFN-α in combination with IL-1β or TNF-α produced a more profound suppression of the HBV enhancer-1 activity than IFN-α alone (5Hamasaki K. Nakata K. Nakao K. Mitsuoka S. Tsutsumi T. Kato Y. Shima M. Ishii N. Tamaoki T. Nagataki S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 904-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). CAT expression from pXEn-CAT was suppressed by approximately 45 and 80% by IFN-α alone and IFN-α in combination with IL-1β, respectively (Fig.2 B, lanes 2 and 4), but its expression was not suppressed by IL-1β alone as reported previously (5Hamasaki K. Nakata K. Nakao K. Mitsuoka S. Tsutsumi T. Kato Y. Shima M. Ishii N. Tamaoki T. Nagataki S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 904-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) (Fig.2 B, lane 3). CAT expression from pXEnISRE(M)-CAT and pXEnΔISRE-CAT, which showed a base-line CAT activity almost similar to that from pXEn-CAT, showed only a slight suppression by IFN-α alone and IFN-α in combination with IL-1β, respectively (Fig. 2 B, lanes 6 and 8 andlanes 10 and 12). IFN-α alone or IFN-α in combination with IL-1β did not affect CAT expression from pX-CAT (Fig. 2 B, lanes 14 and 16). These results suggest that the ISRE-like sequence in the HBV enhancer-1 region is likely to mediate the IFN-α-induced suppression of the enhancer activity. This is a surprising result, because ISRE existing in the promoters of interferon-inducible genes behaves as a positivecis-element (26Cohen B. Peretz D. Vaimain D. Benech P. Chebath J.

However, our results are supported by the following findings. 1) IFN-α suppresses the activity of EBV nuclear antigen 1 gene promoter containing ISRE-like sequence (19Nonkwelo C. Ruf I.K. Sample J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6887-6897Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2) IRF-2, which counteracts with IRF-1 by competitive binding to ISRE (37Harada H. Fujita T. Miyamoto M. Kimura Y. Maruyama M. Furia A.

Cell. 1989; 58: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar), can directly activate the expression of human histone H4 gene through binding to ISRE in its promoter (38Vaughan P.S.

Lew D.J. Decker T. Kessler D.S. Darnell Jr., J.E. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1105-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and that the stable transfection of p48 expression vehicle effectively enhances the response to IFN-α treatment in melanoma cells (40Leonard G.T. Sen G.C. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5095-5101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As suspected, the treatment of HuH-7 cells with 100 IU/ml IFN-γ followed by 1,000 IU/ml IFN-α enhanced the suppressive effect of IFN-α on pXEn-CAT activity by approximately 45–70% (Fig. 3 A, lanes 4 and8), although the IFN-γ treatment alone showed a little effect on its activity (Fig. 3 A, lanes 6 and7). In addition, we cotransfected the p48 expression plasmid together with pXEn-CAT into HuH-7 cells, followed by incubation with or without 1,000 IU/ml IFN-α. p48 transfection without IFN-α treatment resulted in approximately 20% decrease in pXEn-CAT activity (Fig.3 B, lane 3), compared with vehicle transfection (Fig. 3 B, lane 1). In contrast, p48 transfection followed by IFN-α treatment markedly reduced pXEn-CAT activity by 80% (Fig. 3 B, lane 4). However, cotransfection experiments by IRF-1 or its counterpart IRF-2 expression plasmid together with pXEn-CAT showed no significant changes (Fig.3 B, lanes 5 and 6), even though thein vitro translated IRF-1 interacted with the HBV ISRE-like sequence (Fig. 1 A, lane 6). These results suggest that abundance of p48 enhances the IFN-α-mediated suppression of the HBV enhancer-1 activity in HuH-7 cells. Kimura et al. (13Kimura T. Kadokawa Y. Harada H. Matsumoto M. Sato M. Kashiwazaki Y. Tarutani M. Tan R.S.-P. Takasugi T. Matsuyama T. Mak T.W. Noguchi S. Taniguchi T. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) have reported that p48 is essential to the induction of anti-viral genes such as 2′,5′-OAS and PKR by IFN-α, and IRF-1 cannot compensate for the loss of p48. The authors also showed that expression of guanylate-binding protein (GBP) was largely dependent on IRF-1, indicating the diversity of p48 and IRF-1 function. In addition, p48 is a key factor involved in IFN-α- and IFN-γ-induced anti-viral responses against encephalomyocarditis virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, and herpes simplex virus (13Kimura T. Kadokawa Y. Harada H. Matsumoto M. Sato M. Kashiwazaki Y. Tarutani M. Tan R.S.-P. Takasugi T. Matsuyama T. Mak T.W. Noguchi S. Taniguchi T. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Taken together, it is possible that suppression of HBV enhancer activity by IFN-α is largely dependent on p48 rather than IRF-1. In an attempt to investigate whether IFN-α induced p48 or IRF-1 mRNAs in HuH-7 cells, Northern blot analysis was performed. IRF-1 mRNA was induced at 1 h after 1,000 IU/ml IFN-α treatment (Fig. 4 A, lane 2), but its induction was transient as described previously (37Harada H. Fujita T. Miyamoto M. Kimura Y. Maruyama M. Furia A. Miyata T. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1989; 58: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar), while induction of p48 mRNA was still detected 24 h after treatment with IFN-α (Fig. 4 A, lane 6). Similar results were obtained with 100 IU/ml IFN-γ treatment (Fig. 4 B). It is known that p48 is induced by IFN-γ or by viral infection (11Veals S.A. Schindler C. Leonard D. Fu X.-Y. Aebersold R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Levy D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3315-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 15Nguyen H. Hiscott J. Pitha P.M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 293-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). However, recent reports have also revealed that p48 mRNA is induced by IFN-α in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (41Lehtonen A. Matikainen S. Julkunen I. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 794-803PubMed Google Scholar) and that IFN-α/β can stimulate the promoter activity of p48 gene in murine macrophage cell line (42Weihua X. Ling W. Kalvakolanu D.V. Antiviral Res. 1999; 40: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The suppression of HBV enhancer-1 activity by IFN-α in combination with IL-1β was apparently greater than that induced by IFN-α alone. Such synergistic effect was also observed with TNF-α (5Hamasaki K. Nakata K. Nakao K. Mitsuoka S. Tsutsumi T. Kato Y. Shima M. Ishii N. Tamaoki T. Nagataki S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 904-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) or IFN-γ (Fig. 3 A, lane 8). These cytokines are associated with the noncytolytic clearance of HBV from hepatocyte by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (6Guidotti L.G. Ando K. Hobbs M.B. Ishikawa T. Runkel L. Schreiber R.D. Chisari F.V.

Accordingly, it is likely that IFN-α interacts with other cytokines to eradicate the infected virus more efficiently, although further studies are necessary to clarify how IFN-α and other cytokines act cooperatively in viral clearance.

To test whether the factor Xa specificity of allosterically activated antithrombin is encoded in the serpin reactive center loop, we mutated the factor Xa-preferred P2 Gly to the thrombin-preferred P2 Pro. Kinetic studies revealed that the mutation maximally enhanced the reactivity of antithrombin with thrombin 15-fold and decreased its reactivity toward factor Xa 2-fold when the serpin was activated by heparin pentasaccharide, thereby transforming antithrombin into an allosterically activated inhibitor of both factor Xa and thrombin. Surprisingly, the enhanced thrombin specificity of the mutant antithrombin was attenuated when a full-length bridging heparin was the activator, due both to a reduced rate of covalent reaction of the mutant serpin and thrombin and preferred reaction of the mutant serpin as a substrate. These results demonstrate that the reactive center loop sequence determines the specificity of allosterically activated antithrombin for factor Xa and that the conformational flexibility of the P2 Gly may be critical for optimal bridging of antithrombin and thrombin by physiologic heparin and for preventing antithrombin from reacting as a substrate in the bridging complex.

Antithrombin is the principal serpin family protein inhibitor of coagulation proteinases in blood (1Björk I. Olson S.T. Church F.C. Cunningham D.D. Ginsburg D. Hoffman M. Stone S.R. Tollefsen D.M. Chemistry and Biology of Serpins. Plenum Press, New York1997: 17-33Google Scholar). Like other serpins, antithrombin inhibits its target proteinases by undergoing a large scale conformational change during reaction of the serpin as a regular proteinase substrate, resulting in the trapping of proteinase in a stable complex with the serpin (2Gettins P.G.W. Patston P.A. Olson S.T. Serpins: Structure, Function and Biology. R. G. Landes, Austin, TX1996Google Scholar). However, antithrombin differs from most other serpins in that its inhibitory activity is regulated by the polysaccharide cofactor, heparin, which acts to enhance the rate of antithrombin-proteinase reactions several thousand-fold (1Björk I.

Two distinct mechanisms appear to mediate the cofactor effect of heparin, the relative contribution of these mechanisms depending on the proteinase inhibited. The dominant mechanism with factor Xa as the target proteinase involves an allosteric activation of antithrombin by a sequence-specific heparin pentasaccharide (3Thunberg L. Bäckström G. Lindahl U.

The pentasaccharide activates antithrombin by inducing conformational changes in a proteinase binding loop of the serpin known as the reactive center loop, which presumably allows the loop to optimally interact with factor Xa (7Olson S.T.

With thrombin as the target proteinase, the allosteric activation mechanism appears to be a minor contributor to the heparin cofactor activity, since the pentasaccharide minimally enhances the rate of antithrombin inhibition of thrombin. Heparin chains at least 18 saccharides in length and containing the pentasaccharide are instead required to substantially accelerate thrombin inhibition by the serpin. Available evidence suggests that the longer chain heparin accelerates the inhibition reaction by an alternative bridging mechanism in which the binding of both antithrombin and thrombin to heparin promotes the interaction between serpin and proteinase in a ternary complex (6Olson S.T.

Based on these findings it has been implied, although without experimental proof, that the conformational changes induced in the antithrombin reactive center loop by pentasaccharide and full-length heparins allow the loop to optimally interact with factor Xa but not with thrombin because the reactive center loop sequence specifically recognizes factor Xa (2Gettins P.G.W. Patston P.A. Olson S.T. Serpins: Structure, Function and Biology. R. G. Landes, Austin, TX1996Google Scholar). In keeping with such a hypothesis, the P4-P1 IAGR sequence of the loop resembles the IEGR and IDGR P4–P1 sequences in prothrombin, the natural substrate of factor Xa, whereas the loop sequence does not match well the specificity requirements of thrombin except for the P1 Arg residue (17Stubbs M.T. Bode W. Thromb. Res. 1993; 69: 1-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). To test whether the IAGR reactive center loop sequence of antithrombin is responsible for the factor Xa specificity of allosterically activated antithrombin, we chose to mutate the antithrombin P2 Gly to Pro. This choice was made because (i) a P2 Pro is preferred in natural thrombin substrates (17Stubbs M.T. Bode W. Thromb. Res. 1993; 69: 1-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) and (ii) replacement of a P2 Gly for Pro in synthetic tripeptide substrates produces several hundred-fold enhancements in thrombin specificity (18Vindigni A. Dang Q.D. Di Cera E. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 891-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). While the effects of a P2 Gly → Pro mutation in antithrombin on thrombin inhibition were previously found to be modest, the specificity changes resulting from allosteric activation of the mutant antithrombin by heparin pentasaccharide were not examined (19Sheffield W.P. Blajchman M.A. Thromb. Res. 1994; 75: 293-305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 20Sheffield W.P. Blajchman M.A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 339: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Consistent with the predictions of our hypothesis, our results show that the P2 Gly → Pro mutation transforms antithrombin into a serpin that can be activated by the heparin pentasaccharide to inhibit both thrombin and factor Xa with comparable enhanced rates approaching that of activated wild-type antithrombin inhibition of factor Xa. Surprisingly, the P2 Gly → Pro mutation converts antithrombin into a worse inhibitor of thrombin when a full-length heparin is used to activate the serpin, due largely to the preferred reaction of the mutant antithrombin as a substrate of thrombin in the ternary bridging complex with the full-length heparin. Such results suggest that while the P2 Gly of antithrombin is not optimal for interaction with thrombin when the serpin is activated by heparin, the conformational flexibility of this residue may be important to allow antithrombin to efficiently trap thrombin in a stable complex when full-length heparin chains, such as would occur in vivo, bridge the serpin and proteinase in a ternary complex. The cDNA for N135Q antithrombin was used as the template for mutating the P2 Gly residue to Pro in order to mimic the high heparin affinity β-form of plasma antithrombin, which lacks the Asn135 carbohydrate chain (21Brennan S.O. George P.M. Jordan R.E. FEBS Lett. 1987; 219: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out in an M13mp19 vector containing the N135Q antithrombin cDNA template as described (9Gettins P.G.W. Fan B. Crews B.C. Turko I.V. Olson S.T. Streusand V.J.

Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) to resolve the high heparin affinity glycoform corresponding in affinity to plasma β-antithrombin (23Turko I.V. Fan B.

A lower heparin affinity glycoform of the expressed antithrombins resulting from core fucosylation of the Asn155 glycosylation site (26Olson S.T. Francis-Chmura A.M. Swanson R. Björk I.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8881-8889Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) was separated by this procedure and not further characterized. Further purification of variant and wild-type recombinant antithrombins was done by DEAE-Sepharose chromatography followed by Sephacryl S-200 size exclusion chromatography (25Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Concentrations of the recombinant antithrombins were determined from the absorbance at 280 nm using a molar absorption coefficient of 37,700 m−1cm−1 (28Nordenman B. Nyström C. Björk I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 78: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Human α-thrombin was a gift of Dr. John Fenton, New York State Department of Health (Albany, NY). Human factor Xa (predominantly α-form) was obtained by activation of purified factor X followed by purification on SBTI-agarose as described (29Bock P.E. Craig P.A. Olson S.T. Singh P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 273: 375-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) or generously provided by Dr. Paul Bock (Vanderbilt University). Proteinase concentrations were based on active site titrations, which indicated >90% and >70% active enzyme for thrombin and factor Xa, respectively (30Ersdal-Badju E. Lu A. Peng X. Picard V. Zenderouh P. Turk B. Björk I. Olson S.T. Bock S.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The α-methyl glycoside of a synthetic heparin pentasaccharide corresponding to the antithrombin binding sequence in heparin was generously provided by Dr. Maurice Petitou (Sanofi Recherche). A full-length heparin containing the pentasaccharide with an average molecular weight of ∼8000 (∼26 saccharides) was isolated from commercial heparin by size and antithrombin affinity fractionation (25Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Concentrations of pentasaccharide and full-length heparins were determined by stoichiometric titrations of antithrombin with the saccharides monitored by changes in protein fluorescence (6Olson S.T. Björk I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All experiments were done at 25 °C in sodium phosphate buffers containing 20 mmsodium phosphate, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% polyethylene glycol 8000 and 0.10 m NaCl (I 0.15), 0.25m NaCl (I 0.3), or 0.40 m NaCl (I 0.45) adjusted to pH 7.4, unless otherwise noted. Errors associated with reported measurements represent ± 2 S.E. except when otherwise noted. Thrombin (5–100 nm) or factor Xa (50 nm) were incubated with increasing molar ratios of wild-type or variant antithrombins in the absence or presence of heparin levels approximately equimolar with the maximum inhibitor concentration (100 nm to 2 μm). Incubation times were sufficient to complete the reaction based on measured second order rate constants. Residual enzyme activity was determined by 100-fold dilution of an aliquot of the incubation mixture into 100 μmd-Phe-Pip-Arg-p-nitroanilide (S-2238, Chromogenix) for thrombin or 200 μm Spectrozyme FXa (American Diagnostica) for factor Xa, and the initial rate of substrate hydrolysis was measured from the linear absorbance increase at 405 nm. Alternatively, thrombin activity was measured by dilution of enzyme into 50 μm tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (Sigma) with monitoring of substrate hydrolysis from the fluorescence increase at excitation and emission wavelengths of 380 and 440 nm, respectively. All substrates contained 50–100 μg/ml Polybrene to neutralize any added heparin. The inhibition stoichiometry was obtained by extrapolating linear least squares fits of the decrease in residual enzyme activity with increasing molar ratios of inhibitor to enzyme up to the ratio yielding complete enzyme inhibition (25Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The products of antithrombin-proteinase reactions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using the Laemmli discontinuous buffer system (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and a 10% polyacrylamide gel under nonreducing conditions as described (25Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). 5 μmthrombin was reacted with 10 μm antithrombin for 5 min, and 2 μm factor Xa was reacted with 6 μmantithrombin for 30 min in the absence or presence of full-length heparin equimolar with antithrombin in I 0.15 buffer. Thrombin reactions were quenched with 250 μmFPR-chloromethylketone (Calbiochem), and factor Xa reactions were quenched with 500 μm EGR-chloromethylketone (Bachem) prior to preparing samples for electrophoresis. Binding of heparin to antithrombin was quantified by titrations of 20–100 nm inhibitor with a 4–5-fold molar excess of polysaccharide in I 0.3 buffer, monitored from the intrinsic protein fluorescence enhancement that accompanies polysaccharide binding, as in previous studies (6Olson S.T.

Chem. 1991; 266: 6353-6364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Titrations were individually computer fitted by the quadratic equilibrium binding equation to obtain the maximal fluorescence change. Normalized titrations were then globally fit to obtain the KDand binding stoichiometry that best fit all of the binding data (25Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The kinetics of heparin binding to antithrombin were analyzed under pseudo-first order conditions by monitoring the increase in protein fluorescence, which signals binding, in an Applied Photophysics SX-17MV stopped-flow instrument as described (6Olson S.T.

Chem. 1981; 256: 11073-11079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Progress curves were fit by a single exponential function to obtain the observed pseudo-first order binding rate constant, kobs, with values from 6 to 14, such curves averaged for each heparin concentration. A heparin concentration range sufficient to partially saturate an initial low heparin affinity interaction was employed at I 0.15, whereas only subsaturating heparin levels were examined at I0.3 (6Olson S.T. Björk I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second-order rate constants for the association of antithrombin with proteinases were measured under pseudo-first order conditions by using a molar excess of inhibitor over enzyme of at least 10 times the inhibition stoichiometry, similar to previous studies (6Olson S.T.

Reactions contained 50–300 nm antithrombin and 0.1–10 nm proteinase with or without catalytic levels of pentasaccharide or full-length heparins, ranging from 0.25 to 9 nm. For the pentasaccharide-accelerated antithrombin-thrombin reaction, pentasaccharide levels were stoichiometric with antithrombin (100 nm) and ranged from 25 to 200 nm. The time-dependent decrease in enzyme activity, measured from the initial rate of chromogenic or fluorogenic substrate hydrolysis of quenched samples as in determinations of reaction stoichiometry, was computer-fitted by a single exponential function to obtain the observed pseudo-first order rate constant, kobs. Apparent second order association rate constants for uncatalyzed and catalyzed reactions were obtained from the least squares slope of the linear dependence ofkobs on the antithrombin or the heparin concentration, respectively, in accordance with the equation that applies when [AT]o ≫ [H]o (25Olson S.T.

The term multiplying kH represents the antithrombin-heparin complex concentration, which under the conditions of these experiments ([AT]o ≫KAT, H) was closely approximated by [H]o. For the pentasaccharide-accelerated antithrombin-thrombin reaction, kobs was fit by the equations for saturable binding given previously to obtain the second order rate constant for the reaction of antithrombin fully complexed with pentasaccharide (6Olson S.T. Björk I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Apparent second order rate constants were corrected for the different fractions of wild-type and mutant serpin reacting through the inhibitory pathway by multiplying by the measured stoichiometry of proteinase inhibition (2Gettins P.G.W.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8538-8547Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). antithrombin heparin Resolution of the two-step reaction of antithrombin-heparin complex with thrombin was done by analyzing the kinetics of reactions in I 0.15 orI 0.3 buffers in the Applied Photophysics stopped-flow instrument under pseudo-first order conditions, as in previous studies (13Olson S.T. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14891-14895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Rezaie A.R. Olson S.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1026-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Reactions contained 0.06–75 nm thrombin and a 40–400-fold molar excess of antithrombin-heparin complex, generated by saturating 0.025–7.5 μm heparin with a 1.1–2-fold molar excess of antithrombin. The exact concentrations of complex were calculated using measured KD values. Reactions were continuously monitored from the exponential decrease in the rate of hydrolysis of the fluorogenic substrate, tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin, present at 5 μm. kobs values from 4–12 progress curves were averaged for each inhibitor-heparin complex concentration. The dependence of kobs on the antithrombin-heparin complex concentration was fit by the hyperbolic equation (13Olson S.T. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14891-14895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), kobs=k[AT·H]/(1+[S]o/KM)/(KT,ATH+[AT·H]/(1+[S]o/KM))(Eq. 2) where k represents the limiting rate constant for conversion of a noncovalent heparin-antithrombin-thrombin ternary complex to a covalent serpin-proteinase complex with release of heparin, KT, ATH is the dissociation constant for formation of the ternary complex, [S]o is the concentration of fluorogenic substrate, and Km is the Michaelis constant for substrate hydrolysis by thrombin.Km values of 4.5 ± 0.4 and 5.2 ± 0.4 μm were measured in I 0.15 and I0.3 buffers, respectively. Rate constants for dissociation of serpin-proteinase complexes were measured as in previous studies (35Jesty J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10044-10050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Olson S.T. Stephens A.W. Hirs C.H.W. Bock P.E. Björk I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9717-9724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, complexes were formed by reacting 5–10 μm antithrombin with either 0.5 μm thrombin and 1 μmheparin for 30 min or 1 μm factor Xa and 1 μm heparin for 10 min at 25 °C. Thrombin reactions were done in I 0.45 buffer to minimize any substrate reaction, whereas factor Xa reactions were done in I 0.15 buffer. Complexes were diluted to 0.3 to ∼6 nm in 1 ml of 400 μm S2238 or 400 μm Spectrozyme FXa inI 0.15 buffer containing 100 μg/ml polybrene at 37 °C. The initial rate of complex dissociation was continuously monitored from the acceleration of the rate of substrate hydrolysis at 405 nm for 80 min. (<1% complex dissociation). The time-dependent absorbance changes were fit by a second order polynomial equation to obtain the initial rate of complex dissociation, as described (35Jesty J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10044-10050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Olson S.T. Stephens A.W. Hirs C.H.W. Bock P.E. Björk I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9717-9724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Initial rates were plotted against the concentration of serpin-proteinase complex, and the first order dissociation rate constant was calculated from the least squares slope of this linear plot. G392P antithrombin inhibited thrombin and factor Xa in the absence of heparin with ∼1:1 inhibition stoichiometries and with the appearance of stable complexes by SDS-PAGE, similar to the properties of the wild-type inhibitor (Figs. 1 and 2). The inhibition stoichiometries exceeded 1:1 when G392P or wild-type antithrombin reactions were conducted in the presence of either a full-length heparin or a heparin pentasaccharide fragment, which constitutes the binding site for antithrombin within the larger polysaccharide (Fig. 2 and Table I). Such increases in inhibition stoichiometry result from heparin promoting a competing substrate reaction of antithrombin with the proteinase (6Olson S.T. Björk I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D.

Notably, the heparin-induced increases in stoichiometry were more substantial for G392P antithrombin reactions than for wild-type inhibitor reactions (Table I). This was particularly pronounced for the full-length heparin-catalyzed inhibition of thrombin by antithrombin, in which case the mutant inhibitor reaction stoichiometry of 25 ± 3 mol of inhibitor/mol of enzyme greatly exceeded the stoichiometry of 2.2 ± 0.1 mol of inhibitor/mol of enzyme measured for the wild-type inhibitor reaction (Fig. 2). Increasing the ionic strength lowered the inhibition stoichiometry for the heparin-catalyzed mutant antithrombin-thrombin reaction to 5.1 ± 0.5 mol of inhibitor/mol of enzyme at I 0.3 and to ∼2 mol inhibitor/mol enzyme at I 0.45, whereas the wild-type inhibitor reaction stoichiometry was reduced to ∼1 mol inhibitor/mol enzyme under these conditions (Fig. 2), in keeping with the salt dependence of the heparin enhancement of the reaction stoichiometry found in past studies (6Olson S.T.

In this work, a sequential analysis of its transmembrane signaling pathway has been undertaken to characterize the intracellular mechanisms responsible for the Ca2+ rise. The results show that this phospholipid induces, in a dose-dependent manner (ED50 of around 0.25 μg/ml), a Ca2+ mobilization from inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-insensitive intracellular stores, with no participation of extracellular Ca2+. Upon repeated administration, it shows no signs of autologous desensitization, does not induce heterologous desensitization of thel-α-lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptor but is desensitized by the previous administration of LPA. The Ca2+-mobilizing activity requires a membrane protein, is blocked after preincubation of the cells with pertussis toxin and phorbol esters, as well as by U73122 (an inhibitor of phospholipases C/D), R59022 (a diacylglycerol kinase inhibitor), and D609 (which inhibits phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C). Upon administration of this phospholipid, the intracellular levels of phosphatidic acid (PA) rise with a time course that parallels that of the Ca2+ mobilization, suggesting that PA could be responsible for this Ca2+ signal. Exposure to AACOCF3 (a specific inhibitor of phospholipase A2) does not modify the Ca2+ rise, ruling out the possibility that the PA generated could be further converted to LPA by the action of phospholipase A2. Based on the experimental data obtained, a signaling pathway involving a phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C coupled to diacylglycerol kinase is proposed.

U73122, R59022,and D609 were obtained from Calbiochem. Fura-2 pentaacetoxymethylester (fura-2/AM) and the pentapotassium salt of fura-2 were obtained from Molecular Probes. Nickel(II) chloride was purchased from Merck. Lipid purification procedure has been described in detail elsewhere (12Camiña J.P. Casabiell X. Pérez F.R. Lage M. Casanueva F.F. Bichem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 696-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Briefly, total lipids were extracted from bovine vitreous body homogenate with 4 volumes of chloroform:methanol (1:2) at room temperature. VLF was purified from crude lipids by solid phase extraction (Sep-Pack C18), silica column chromatography, anion-exchange chromatography (DEAE-Sephadex, acetate form) and, finally, by high pressure liquid chromatography (cyanopropylsilyl-bonded silica). The activity was followed along the purification procedure by a [Ca2+]i mobilization bioassay as described (12Camiña J.P. Casabiell X. Pérez F.R. Lage M. Casanueva F.F. Bichem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 696-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Although most of the cell lines tested were able to respond to this factor (11Pombo C. Bokser L. Casabiell X. Zugaza J. Capeans M. Salorio M. Casanueva F.F. Graefe's Arch. Clin. Exp. Ophthalmol. 1996; 234: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), all the experiments were carried out on the EGFR-T17 cell line, a clone of NIH3T3 (14Velu T.J. Beguinot L. Vas W.C.

To measure the biological responses, cells were seeded in 100-mm dishes and cultured to 80% confluence for 2 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. Media were supplemented with penicillin G (100 units/ml) and streptomycin sulfate (100 mg/ml). Cells were grown under a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Intracellular [Ca2+]i measurements were performed in cell suspensions using the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator fura-2. Cells were resuspended (2 × 100-mm plates/ml) in Krebs-Ringer-Hepes (KRH containing, in mm/liter, NaCl, 125; KCl, 5; MgSO4, 1.2; KH2PO4, 1.2; CaCl2, 2; glucose, 6; HEPES, 25, pH 7.4) and loaded with 3 μm fura-2/AM for 30 min at 37 °C under gentle continuous mixing. Cell suspensions were then diluted 1:4 with KRH and maintained at room temperature until use. For each measurement, around 2 × 106 cells were resuspended in 2 ml of KRH and then placed in a cuvette positioned in a holder, thermostatically controlled at 37 ± 1 °C. The fluorescence signal was measured under continuous stirring in a LS-50B fluorimeter (Perkin-Elmer), adjusted to λex = 345 and λem = 490 nm (15Grynckiewickz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ca2+ readings were performed in ratio mode, using λ1ex = 345, λ2ex = 380, and λem = 490 nm, as described previously (4Casabiell X. Pandiella A. Casanueva F.F. Biochem.

Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Extracellular Ca2+ measurements were performed with the cell-impermeant Ca2+ indicator fura-2 (0.25 μm) in Ca2+-efflux buffer (containing, in mm/liter, NaCl, 145; KCl, 5; glucose, 10; HEPES, 10, pH 7.4) essentially as described (17Zhang B.X. Zhao H. Loessberg P. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15419-15425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were labeled in 6-well multiwells by incubation in a 1:4 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and inositol-free basal medium of Eagle, containing 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum (final inositol concentration, 10 μm), supplemented withmyo-[2-3H]inositol (2 μCi/ml) for 48 h. The incubation medium was removed, and the monolayers were washed three times with KRH and then incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in KRH supplemented with 10 mm LiCl. Cells were stimulated with test agents for 30 min, after which the reactions were stopped, and the acid-soluble radioactivity extracted with 10% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid for 30 min on ice. After the centrifugation, the supernatants were washed with diethyl ether, and the total [3H]inositol phosphates were analyzed essentially as described (4Casabiell X. Pandiella A. Casanueva F.F. Biochem. J. 1991; 278: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 18Pérez F. Casabiell X. Camiña J. Zugaza J. Casanueva F.F. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 264-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in 6-well multiwells to a confluence of 80%, and then labeled with 1 μCi/ml of [3H]myristic acid in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.25% fetal bovine serum. Before stimulation, cells were washed three times with KRH and incubated in this solution for 1 h. Cells were stimulated in this solution (freshly added) with the test agents at different times. Controls received an equivalent amount of vehicle (methanol). At the desired times, media were aspirated, and reactions immediately stopped by the addition of 2 ml of methanol to the plates. After 30 min, methanol extracts were transferred to glass tubes and mixed with 2 volumes of chloroform. To monitor the chromatographic separation, the following carrier lipids (30 μg each) were added to the samples: 1,2-sn-dioleoylglycerol, PA, and PC. Phase separation was achieved by the addition of 0.2 volume of water (19Folch J. Lees V. Sloane Stanly G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lipids present in the lower phase were separated on silica gel 60 TLC plates (Merck) using the upper phase of a mixture of ethyl acetate:isooctane:acetic acid:water (13:2:3:10 by volume) as the eluant (20Ha K.-S.

Lipid spots were visualized with iodine vapors, scraped off the plates, and prepared for liquid scintillation counting. When purified VLF was administered to EGFR-T17 cells, a prominent, transient [Ca2+]i peak was observed that was followed by a small downward deflection of the fluorescence tracing and subsequently by a return to the prestimulatory levels (Fig.1 A). This Ca2+peak was due exclusively to a redistribution from intracellular stores, as shown by the lack of effect of EGTA on the signal (Fig.1 B), the absence of a significant blockade in the presence of extracellular Ni2+ that blocks Ca2+ entry through Ca2+ channels (22Byron K.L. Babnigg G. Villereal M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 108-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 C), and the absence of peak observed in cells pretreated for 30 min with 50 nm thapsigargin, a blocker of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pumps that empties the intracellular Ca2+ stores (23Law G.J. Patcher J.A. Phastrup O. Hanley M.R. Dannies P.S. Biochem. J. 1990; 267: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 D). The slight downward deflection that follows the Ca2+ peak could in principle be the result of an efflux of Ca2+ to the extracellular medium. In fact, it was absent in the presence of extracellular Ni2+ or EGTA. However, the direct measurement of extracellular Ca2+ changes with fura-2 failed to detect any significant efflux after treatment of the cells with VLF, whereas a strong efflux was evident after the addition of LPA (Fig.1 E). The VLF-induced [Ca2+]i rise was dose-dependent. As Fig. 1 F shows, the response was half-maximal at around 0.25 μg/ml with saturation at doses in excess of 1 μg/ml. This would represent an ED50 ranging from 250 nm for the simplest phospholipid molecule (phosphatidic acid) to less than 100 nm if we assume the presence of a phospholipid with a complex polar head including several sugar residues (12Camiña J.P. Casabiell X. Pérez F.R. Lage M. Casanueva F.F. Bichem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 696-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The dose-response curve obtained for VLF (Fig. 1 F) strongly suggests the presence of a saturable receptor molecule on the cell surface. To test this hypothesis, cell suspensions were treated with the cell-impermeant sulfhydryl reagent N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). This reagent oxydizes the cysteine residues at the extracellular domains of membrane proteins, rendering many of them inactive (24Riordan J.F. Vallee B.L. Methods in Enzymology. 25. Academic Press, New York1972: 449-457Google Scholar). As Fig. 2 A shows, the preincubation (5 min) of the cells in the presence of 15 μm NEM resulted in a strong inhibition of the VLF-induced Ca2+ peak with no reduction of the Ca2+ peak elicited by ionomycin. The inhibition by NEM was dose-dependent, as shown in Fig. 2 B, exceeding 75% at a dose of 15 μm. As a control, we used the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin, a mobile ion carrier that acts by direct incorporation into the lipid bilayer and does not require any additional membrane protein for its function. No significant effect on the ionomycin-induced Ca2+ peak was evident at any of the NEM doses tested. It is interesting to note that after ionomycin treatment the post-stimulatory plateau is somewhat higher in NEM-treated cells than in control cells. This may reflect damage of the Ca2+ extrusion mechanisms at the plasma membrane after the treatment with NEM. In most cellular systems, the mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular stores is usually triggered by activation of the phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC). This enzyme acts on phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) at the internal leaflet of the plasma membrane generating inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3), which will in turn trigger the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores (25Berridge M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 159-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (2435) Google Scholar, 26Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (6129) Google Scholar). To test whether this mechanism could be responsible for the observed VLF-induced Ca2+ signal, the effect of U73122, a drug that has been extensively used as a specific inhibitor of PI-PLC (6Okajima F. Kondo Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26332-26340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) has been studied. As Fig. 3 shows, the preincubation of EGFR-T17 cells in the presence of U73122 (2.5 μm, 5 min) caused an almost complete blockade of the Ca2+ transients induced by VLF. U73122 exerts similar effects on the Ca2+ mobilization induced by LPA, a lipid that acts by activation of the PI-PLC (27van Corven E. Groenink A. Jalink K. Eichholtz T. Moolenaar W.H. Cell. 1989; 59: 45-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 28Hovis J.G. Stumpo D.J. Halsey O.L. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10380-10386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to Ins(1,4,5)P3, the action of PI-PLC generates diacylglycerol (DAG), a second messenger that activates protein kinase C (PKC) (29Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4203) Google Scholar). To assess the role, if any, of DAG-PKC on the VLF-activated signaling pathway, PKC activity was stimulated by means of the phorbol ester PMA. As Fig. 4 shows, the acute administration of PMA (1 μm, 5 min) caused a complete blockade of the VLF-induced Ca2+ transient (Fig. 4, A andB), a blockade that was prevented when the PKC activity was down-regulated by a chronic (1 μm, 24 h) exposure to the phorbol ester (Fig. 4 C) (28Hovis J.G. Stumpo D.J. Halsey O.L. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10380-10386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 4Effect of PMA on the VLF-induced calcium signal. Cells were stimulated with VLF (1 μg/ml) under control conditions (A) or after preincubation in the presence of the phorbol ester PMA (1 μm, 5 min) (B). PKC activity was down-regulated (C) by chronic (1 μm, 24 h) exposure to the phorbol ester prior to the new acute administration of PMA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the last few years it has been recognized that a simple phospholipid-derived molecule, LPA, is a potent chemical mediator that triggers different cellular responses in a number of cell lines (1Moolenaar W.H. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 213-219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar,30Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). To gain further insight into the mechanism of action of VLF, it was compared with LPA. Activation of intracellular Ca2+mobilization is one of the earliest cellular signals elicited by LPA. As Fig. 5 A shows, upon repeated administration, LPA induces homologous desensitization of its transmembrane signaling system and, in addition, induces heterologous desensitization to VLF. However, when the order of the stimuli was reversed (Fig. 5 B), it was evident that VLF did not induce homologous desensitization of its receptor and was unable to cross-desensitize the LPA receptor. This result was surprising because if one assumes that the signaling is mediated by PI-PLC, DAG would be generated in parallel with Ins(1,4,5)P3, triggering the activation of PKC, which in turn would close the system rendering it refractory to further activation by VLF or LPA. To solve this discrepancy, the generation of inositol phosphates after stimulation of the cells with VLF and other stimuli, such as LPA, sphingosine 1-phosphate and epidermal growth factor, known to activate PtdIns(4,5)P2 hydrolysis was studied. As Fig.6 shows, VLF failed to induce formation of inositol phosphates from labeled PtdIns(4,5)P2, a result that strongly questions the hypothesis that VLF induces Ca2+ mobilization via activation of PI-PLC. Furthermore, when the effect of PTX on the Ca2+ transient was evaluated, the preincubation of the cells with the toxin (100 ng/ml, 2 h) resulted in a virtually complete blockade of the VLF-induced Ca2+ signal (Fig. 3). In contrast, PTX caused only a slight reduction in the LPA-induced Ca2+ signal. The α subunits of the G-proteins that couple receptors to the phospholipase C-Ins(1,4,5)P3-Ca2+ pathway belong to the Gq subfamily, and are not sensitive to PTX (33Gudermann T. Schöneberg T. Schultz G. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 399-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 34Sprang S.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 639-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar, 35Singer W.D. Brown A.H. Sternweis P.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 475-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). For VLF, the G-protein involved appears to be a Gi, sensitive to PTX, and not coupled to PI-PLC. In fact, none of the products generated by this enzyme (Ins(1,4,5)P3 and DAG), appear to rise after VLF stimulation of EGFR-T17 cells. In NIH 3T3 cells, the Ins(1,4,5)P3-sensitive Ca2+ pool is dynamically coupled to extracellular Ca2+. When the Ca2+ levels in the Ins(1,4,5)P3-sensitive Ca2+ pool are reduced immediately after the activation of the Ins(1,4,5)P3-Ca2+ pathway by agonists that activate the hydrolysis of PtdIns(4,5)P2 at the plasma membrane (LPA and EGF, for instance), a Ca2+ influx is triggered by aperture of capacitative Ca2+ channels (or store-operated channels) at the plasma membrane (36Ribeiro C.M.P. Reece J. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26555-26561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 37Ribeiro C.M.P. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21522-21528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). As the Ca2+ redistribution that follows the administration of VLF appears to originate from a Ca2+ pool not triggered by Ins(1,4,5)P3, we analyzed the effect of VLF-induced Ca2+ redistribution on the Ca2+ influx. As Fig.7 A shows, the addition of thapsigargin to EGFR-T17 cells suspended in a nominally Ca2+-free medium was followed by a transient increase of the [Ca2+]i due to the emptying of intracellular Ca2+ stores. When the extracellular Ca2+ was restored, a prominent capacitative Ca2+ influx was evident. A similar Ca2+ influx was evident after restoring the extracellular Ca2+ in cells prestimulated with LPA (Fig.7 B) or EGF (Fig. 7 C) in Ca2+-free medium. On the contrary, when the cells were prestimulated with VLF in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, only a minor increase of Ca2+ was apparent after the restoration of the extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 7 D); however, this deflection of the fluorescence tracing was not different from the one observed when the extracellular Ca2+ was restored in control, nonstimulated cells (Fig. 7 E). These results suggest that the Ca2+ pool mobilized by VLF is not functionally coupled to capacitative Ca2+ entry, a data that further reinforces the hypothesis that this pool is different from the Ins(1,4,5)P3-sensitive Ca2+ pool. Ca2+ mobilization from non-Ins(1,4,5)P3-sensitive Ca2+ stores is activated in some cellular systems by phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC), an enzyme that hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine generating diacylglycerol and phosphocholine (38Leprêtre N. Mironneau J. Morel J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29546-29552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Macrez-Leprêtre N. Morel J. Mironneau J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1996; 218: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The newly formed DAG is then converted by the action of a diacylglycerol kinase (DAG-K) to PA, which in turn will activate Ca2+ redistribution from internal stores (40Sakane F. Yamada K. Imai S. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7096-7100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41van der Bend R.L. de Widt J. Hilkmann H. van Blitterswijk W.J. J. Biol.

To check the possibility that VLF could be using this signaling pathway, the DAG-K inhibitor R59022 (42Sakano S. Takemura H. Yamada K. Imoto K. Kaneko M. Ohshika H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11148-11155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 43de Chaffoy de Courcelles D. Roevens P. Van Belle H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1990; 265: 15418-15423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used. As Fig. 8, A andB shows, the preincubation (10 μm, 30 min) in the presence of this inhibitor caused a clear-cut blockade of the Ca2+ peak, strongly suggesting that this pathway could be taking part in the triggering of the Ca2+ redistribution. In addition, the reduction of the Ca2+ transients observed after preincubating the cells with the PC-PLC inhibitor D609 (39Macrez-Leprêtre N. Morel J. Mironneau J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1996; 218: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 45Schütze S. Potthoff K. Machleidt T. Berkovic D. Wiegmann K. Krönke M. Cell. 1992; 71: 765-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar) (10 μm, 5 min) (Fig. 8 C) reinforced this interpretation. The inhibitory effects of both R59022 and D609 appear to be specific, as no inhibition was apparent when the cells were stimulated with either EGF or LPA (Fig. 8 E). Furthermore, the lack of effect of the PLA2-specific inhibitor AACOCF3 (10 μm, 5 min) on the Ca2+ rise (Fig. 8 D), strongly supports the hypothesis of a direct action of PA on the intracellular Ca2+ stores, rather than an indirect one mediated by its conversion to LPA by PLA2, as has been demonstrated for sphingosylphosphorylcholine (46Orlati S. Porcelli A. Hrelia S. Lorenzini A. Rugolo M. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 641-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In fact, when the levels of intracellular Ca2+ and PA were correlated in VLF- or LPA-stimulated cells (Fig. 9,A and C), it became clear that the administration of purified VLF, but not LPA, was followed by a rapid and transient increase of the PA levels (Fig. 9 B), and the time course of the PA rise in VLF-stimulated cells closely matched the time course of the Ca2+ elevation, strongly suggesting that the PA rise may be in fact the biochemical signal triggering the Ca2+transient in VLF-stimulated cells.Figure 9Time courses of the Ca2+ and PA rises in cells stimulated with VLF and LPA . Parallel subconfluent dishes were: (i) resuspended and loaded with fura-2 for high speed monitorization of the Ca2+ levels in response to VLF (1 μg/ml, arrow) (A), or LPA (1 μg/ml) (C); (ii) labeled with [3H]myristic acid for the determination of PA generation after stimulation with VLF or LPA (both at 5 μg/ml) by TLC (B). Results (mean ± S.E.) are from three independent determinations and expressed in Bas the increase (in cpm) over control values.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) From the analysis of the data presented so far, the signal transduction pathway used by VLF, the complex lipid isolated by our group from bovine vitreous body to induce Ca2+mobilization, can be delineated. This Ca2+ signal is generated exclusively by redistribution from internal stores, with no significant participation of the extracellular Ca2+. It requires the presence of a membrane protein, the inactivation of which by NEM greatly reduces the ability of VLF to induce Ca2+mobilization, and determines a dose-response curve showing half-maximal saturation in the nanomolar range. The coupling between this putative membrane receptor and the intracellular effectors is mediated by a PTX-sensitive G-protein, as shown by the virtually complete blockade of the Ca2+ signal after PTX treatment of the cell suspensions. In a similar way, the phospholipase C (PLC) blocker U73122 was able to suppress the Ca2+ mobilization response. The system appears to be under regulation by PKC, because phorbol esters cause a complete suppression of the response, which disappears when the endogenous PKC activity is down-regulated by chronic exposure to the phorbol ester. Taken together, the data obtained resembled the transmembrane signaling pathway described for LPA (27van Corven E. Groenink A. Jalink K. Eichholtz T. Moolenaar W.H. Cell. 1989; 59: 45-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). However, a closer analysis revealed some differences. First, upon repeated administration, LPA causes an autologous desensitization that renders the cell unresponsive to further stimulation with this lipid. After the repeated administration of VLF, on the contrary, no signs of autologous desensitization are evident, despite the clear-cut heterologous desensitization that LPA induces on the VLF Ca2+ signal. Second, the Ca2+ pool mobilized by LPA is Ins(1,4,5)P3-sensitive, and consequently the administration of LPA is followed by a stimulation of Ins(1,4,5)P3formation. No such stimulation was evident, however, after the administration of VLF. Furthermore, for receptors coupled to PI-PLC by G-proteins, the Gα subtype involved is a Gq, that is not sensitive to PTX (47Fields T. Casey P. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), as it happens for LPA. For VLF, however, both the exquisite sensitivity to PTX and the lack of detectable Ins(1,4,5)P3 generation exclude a Gqas the mediator between the receptor and the effector. This is in contrast with the data obtained after exposure of the cells to U73122, an inhibitor of PI-PLC. However, several reports have pointed out that the action of this drug is far from being specific, being able to also inhibit other PLCs, as well as phospholipase D (48Freeman E. Chisolm G.M. Ann Tallant E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 84-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 49Mogami H. Lloid Mills C. Gallacher D.V. Biochem.

Taking this into account, the Ca2+ mobilization induced by VLF could be explained by two alternate routes; either the PTX-sensitive G-protein is coupled to phospholipase D, inducing the intracellular accumulation of PA, or coupled to a different PLC, such as PC-PLC. The sensitivity to PKC activation strongly suggests that the latter possibility is more plausible, as the activation of PKC is followed in most systems by activation of phospholipase D activity and/or blockade of PC-PLC (29Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4203) Google Scholar,50Shukla S.D. Halenda S.P. Life Sci. 1991; 48: 851-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 51Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1994: 26-42Crossref Scopus (914) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the preincubation of the cells with inhibitors of both PC-PLC and DAG-K caused a complete blockade of the VLF-induced Ca2+ signal, whereas the preincubation with the PLA2 inhibitor AACOCF3 was devoid of action (Fig. 8). These results strongly suggest that the Ca2+signal was in fact due to a direct rise in the intracellular PA levels and not to an indirect action mediated by a PLA2-mediated conversion of PA to LPA, as has been demonstrated for other systems (46Orlati S. Porcelli A. Hrelia S. Lorenzini A. Rugolo M. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 641-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In fact, the measurement of the time course of PA generation in VLF-stimulated cells unambiguously shows that the PA levels rise in response to the VLF administration with a time course comparable to the Ca2+ mobilization (Fig. 9). It thus appears that, in our experimental system, PA is in fact the signal that triggers the Ca2+ rise from Ins(1,4,5)P3-independent stores rather than a mere consequence of the Ca2+ elevation, as it has been suggested for other systems (21van Blitterswijk W.J. Hilkmann H. de Widt J. van der Bend R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10344-10350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, the data obtained in the present study strongly suggest that VLF acts through a signaling pathway different to the one used by LPA and other bioactive lipids (Fig.10). Upon ligand binding, the receptor activates a PC-PLC through a PTX-sensitive G-protein. The activation of PC-PLC results in the generation of phosphocholine and DAG. The latter would be rapidly converted to PA by means of a DAG-K associated with the receptor-G-protein complex, with virtually no activation of PKC, so the system would not show, as observed, homologous or heterologous desensitization of the LPA transmembrane signaling system (Fig. 5). In fact, it has been recently shown that DAG-K is topologically restricted in the plasma membrane and physically coupled to activated receptors (41van der Bend R.L. de Widt J. Hilkmann H. van Blitterswijk W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4098-4102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PA, in turn, would act on intracellular, non-Ins(1,4,5)P3-sensitive stores, triggering the observed Ca2+ transients. The biological role of this new class of bioactive lipids in the physiology and pathophysiology of the vitreous body has not been ascertained as of yet. The identification of this new class of lipids, with strong cellular activation properties could have important and unexpected implications in our understanding of the pathophysiology of altered proliferation at the vitreous body/retina.

Lesion studies have shown that the hippocampus is necessary for declarative memory, but pinning down its exact contribution to these individual stages has proved tricky. Because brain lesions are permanent, they cannot unambiguously dissociate the stages of memory."
