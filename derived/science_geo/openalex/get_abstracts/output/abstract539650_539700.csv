https://openalex.org/W1497915798,"Jen Jen Yeh and colleagues apply statistical methods to separate tumor, stroma and normal tissue gene expression signatures from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma expression profiling data sets. They identify and validate two tumor-specific and two stroma-specific subtypes, which are associated with different clinical outcomes. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains a lethal disease with a 5-year survival rate of 4%. A key hallmark of PDAC is extensive stromal involvement, which makes capturing precise tumor-specific molecular information difficult. Here we have overcome this problem by applying blind source separation to a diverse collection of PDAC gene expression microarray data, including data from primary tumor, metastatic and normal samples. By digitally separating tumor, stromal and normal gene expression, we have identified and validated two tumor subtypes, including a 'basal-like' subtype that has worse outcome and is molecularly similar to basal tumors in bladder and breast cancers. Furthermore, we define 'normal' and 'activated' stromal subtypes, which are independently prognostic. Our results provide new insights into the molecular composition of PDAC, which may be used to tailor therapies or provide decision support in a clinical setting where the choice and timing of therapies are critical."
https://openalex.org/W2149639441,"The mechanisms by which melanoma and other cancer cells evade anti-tumor immunity remain incompletely understood. Here, we show that the growth of tumors formed by mutant Braf(V600E) mouse melanoma cells in an immunocompetent host requires their production of prostaglandin E2, which suppresses immunity and fuels tumor-promoting inflammation. Genetic ablation of cyclooxygenases (COX) or prostaglandin E synthases in Braf(V600E) mouse melanoma cells, as well as in Nras(G12D) melanoma or in breast or colorectal cancer cells, renders them susceptible to immune control and provokes a shift in the tumor inflammatory profile toward classic anti-cancer immune pathways. This mouse COX-dependent inflammatory signature is remarkably conserved in human cutaneous melanoma biopsies, arguing for COX activity as a driver of immune suppression across species. Pre-clinical data demonstrate that inhibition of COX synergizes with anti-PD-1 blockade in inducing eradication of tumors, implying that COX inhibitors could be useful adjuvants for immune-based therapies in cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W1777916189,"Macromolecular complexes are essential to conserved biological processes, but their prevalence across animals is unclear. By combining extensive biochemical fractionation with quantitative mass spectrometry, here we directly examined the composition of soluble multiprotein complexes among diverse metazoan models. Using an integrative approach, we generated a draft conservation map consisting of more than one million putative high-confidence co-complex interactions for species with fully sequenced genomes that encompasses functional modules present broadly across all extant animals. Clustering reveals a spectrum of conservation, ranging from ancient eukaryotic assemblies that have probably served cellular housekeeping roles for at least one billion years, ancestral complexes that have accrued contemporary components, and rarer metazoan innovations linked to multicellularity. We validated these projections by independent co-fractionation experiments in evolutionarily distant species, affinity purification and functional analyses. The comprehensiveness, centrality and modularity of these reconstructed interactomes reflect their fundamental mechanistic importance and adaptive value to animal cell systems."
https://openalex.org/W1414898727,"Finding new treatment-shortening antibiotics to improve cure rates and curb the alarming emergence of drug resistance is the major objective of tuberculosis (TB) drug development. Using a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry imaging suite in a biosafety containment facility, we show that the key sterilizing drugs rifampicin and pyrazinamide efficiently penetrate the sites of TB infection in lung lesions. Rifampicin even accumulates in necrotic caseum, a critical lesion site where persisting tubercle bacilli reside. In contrast, moxifloxacin, which is active in vitro against a subpopulation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis that persists in specific niches under drug pressure and has achieved treatment shortening in mice, does not diffuse well in caseum, concordant with its failure to shorten therapy in recent clinical trials. We suggest that such differential spatial distribution and kinetics of accumulation in lesions may create temporal and spatial windows of monotherapy in specific niches, allowing the gradual development of multidrug-resistant TB. We propose an alternative working model to prioritize new antibiotic regimens based on quantitative and spatial distribution of TB drugs in the major lesion types found in human lungs. The finding that lesion penetration may contribute to treatment outcome has wide implications for TB."
https://openalex.org/W2102431257,"The strychnine-sensitive glycine receptor (GlyR) mediates inhibitory synaptic transmission in the spinal cord and brainstem and is linked to neurological disorders, including autism and hyperekplexia. Understanding of molecular mechanisms and pharmacology of glycine receptors has been hindered by a lack of high-resolution structures. Here we report electron cryo-microscopy structures of the zebrafish α1 GlyR with strychnine, glycine, or glycine and ivermectin (glycine/ivermectin). Strychnine arrests the receptor in an antagonist-bound closed ion channel state, glycine stabilizes the receptor in an agonist-bound open channel state, and the glycine/ivermectin complex adopts a potentially desensitized or partially open state. Relative to the glycine-bound state, strychnine expands the agonist-binding pocket via outward movement of the C loop, promotes rearrangement of the extracellular and transmembrane domain 'wrist' interface, and leads to rotation of the transmembrane domain towards the pore axis, occluding the ion conduction pathway. These structures illuminate the GlyR mechanism and define a rubric to interpret structures of Cys-loop receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1875936957,"Peroxisomes are highly metabolic, autonomously replicating organelles that generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) as a by-product of fatty acid β-oxidation. Consequently, cells must maintain peroxisome homeostasis, or risk pathologies associated with too few peroxisomes, such as peroxisome biogenesis disorders, or too many peroxisomes, inducing oxidative damage and promoting diseases such as cancer. We report that the PEX5 peroxisome import receptor binds ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and localizes this kinase to the peroxisome. In response to ROS, ATM signalling activates ULK1 and inhibits mTORC1 to induce autophagy. Specificity for autophagy of peroxisomes (pexophagy) is provided by ATM phosphorylation of PEX5 at Ser 141, which promotes PEX5 monoubiquitylation at Lys 209, and recognition of ubiquitylated PEX5 by the autophagy adaptor protein p62, directing the autophagosome to peroxisomes to induce pexophagy. These data reveal an important new role for ATM in metabolism as a sensor of ROS that regulates pexophagy."
https://openalex.org/W2239518951,"Association studies have greatly refined the understanding of how variation within the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes influences risk of multiple sclerosis. However, the extent to which major effects are modulated by interactions is poorly characterized. We analyzed high-density SNP data on 17,465 cases and 30,385 controls from 11 cohorts of European ancestry, in combination with imputation of classical HLA alleles, to build a high-resolution map of HLA genetic risk and assess the evidence for interactions involving classical HLA alleles. Among new and previously identified class II risk alleles (HLA-DRB1*15:01, HLA-DRB1*13:03, HLA-DRB1*03:01, HLA-DRB1*08:01 and HLA-DQB1*03:02) and class I protective alleles (HLA-A*02:01, HLA-B*44:02, HLA-B*38:01 and HLA-B*55:01), we find evidence for two interactions involving pairs of class II alleles: HLA-DQA1*01:01-HLA-DRB1*15:01 and HLA-DQB1*03:01-HLA-DQB1*03:02. We find no evidence for interactions between classical HLA alleles and non-HLA risk-associated variants and estimate a minimal effect of polygenic epistasis in modulating major risk alleles."

https://openalex.org/W2162955464,"Encounters between immune cells and invading bacteria ultimately determine the course of infection. These interactions are usually measured in populations of cells, masking cell-to-cell variation that may be important for infection outcome. To characterize the gene expression variation that underlies distinct infection outcomes and monitor infection phenotypes, we developed an experimental system that combines single-cell RNA-seq with fluorescent markers. Probing the responses of individual macrophages to invading Salmonella, we find that variation between individual infected host cells is determined by the heterogeneous activity of bacterial factors in individual infecting bacteria. We illustrate how variable PhoPQ activity in the population of invading bacteria drives variable host type I IFN responses by modifying LPS in a subset of bacteria. This work demonstrates a causative link between host and bacterial variability, with cell-to-cell variation between different bacteria being sufficient to drive radically different host immune responses. This co-variation has implications for host-pathogen dynamics in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1900001134,"Abiotic stress, such as salinity, drought, and cold, causes detrimental yield losses for all major plant crop species. Understanding mechanisms that improve plants' ability to produce biomass, which largely is constituted by the plant cell wall, is therefore of upmost importance for agricultural activities. Cellulose is a principal component of the cell wall and is synthesized by microtubule-guided cellulose synthase enzymes at the plasma membrane. Here, we identified two components of the cellulose synthase complex, which we call companion of cellulose synthase (CC) proteins. The cytoplasmic tails of these membrane proteins bind to microtubules and promote microtubule dynamics. This activity supports microtubule organization, cellulose synthase localization at the plasma membrane, and renders seedlings less sensitive to stress. Our findings offer a mechanistic model for how two molecular components, the CC proteins, sustain microtubule organization and cellulose synthase localization and thus aid plant biomass production during salt stress.

https://openalex.org/W1433995531,"An important fraction of microbial diversity is harbored in strain individuality, so identification of conspecific bacterial strains is imperative for improved understanding of microbial community functions. Limitations in bioinformatics and sequencing technologies have to date precluded strain identification owing to difficulties in phasing short reads to faithfully recover the original strain-level genotypes, which have highly similar sequences. We present ConStrains, an open-source algorithm that identifies conspecific strains from metagenomic sequence data and reconstructs the phylogeny of these strains in microbial communities. The algorithm uses single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) patterns in a set of universal genes to infer within-species structures that represent strains. Applying ConStrains to simulated and host-derived datasets provides insights into microbial community dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2097198003,"Desmoplastic melanoma is an uncommon variant of melanoma with sarcomatous histology, distinct clinical behavior and unknown pathogenesis. We performed low-coverage genome and high-coverage exome sequencing of 20 desmoplastic melanomas, followed by targeted sequencing of 293 genes in a validation cohort of 42 cases. A high mutation burden (median of 62 mutations/Mb) ranked desmoplastic melanoma among the most highly mutated cancers. Mutation patterns strongly implicate ultraviolet radiation as the dominant mutagen, indicating a superficially located cell of origin. Newly identified alterations included recurrent promoter mutations of NFKBIE, encoding NF-κB inhibitor ɛ (IκBɛ), in 14.5% of samples. Common oncogenic mutations in melanomas, in particular in BRAF (encoding p.Val600Glu) and NRAS (encoding p.Gln61Lys or p.Gln61Arg), were absent. Instead, other genetic alterations known to activate the MAPK and PI3K signaling cascades were identified in 73% of samples, affecting NF1, CBL, ERBB2, MAP2K1, MAP3K1, BRAF, EGFR, PTPN11, MET, RAC1, SOS2, NRAS and PIK3CA, some of which are candidates for targeted therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2157495054,"During eukaryotic translation initiation, 43S complexes, comprising a 40S ribosomal subunit, initiator transfer RNA and initiation factors (eIF) 2, 3, 1 and 1A, attach to the 5'-terminal region of messenger RNA and scan along it to the initiation codon. Scanning on structured mRNAs also requires the DExH-box protein DHX29. Mammalian eIF3 contains 13 subunits and participates in nearly all steps of translation initiation. Eight subunits having PCI (proteasome, COP9 signalosome, eIF3) or MPN (Mpr1, Pad1, amino-terminal) domains constitute the structural core of eIF3, to which five peripheral subunits are flexibly linked. Here we present a cryo-electron microscopy structure of eIF3 in the context of the DHX29-bound 43S complex, showing the PCI/MPN core at ∼6 Å resolution. It reveals the organization of the individual subunits and their interactions with components of the 43S complex. We were able to build near-complete polyalanine-level models of the eIF3 PCI/MPN core and of two peripheral subunits. The implications for understanding mRNA ribosomal attachment and scanning are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1810630981,"Multidomain pro-apoptotic BAX and BAK, once activated, permeabilize mitochondria to trigger apoptosis, whereas anti-apoptotic BCL-2 members preserve mitochondrial integrity. The BH3-only molecules (BH3s) promote apoptosis by either activating BAX-BAK or inactivating anti-apoptotic members. Here, we present biochemical and genetic evidence that NOXA is a bona fide activator BH3. Using combinatorial gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches in Bid(-/-)Bim(-/-)Puma(-/-)Noxa(-/-) and Bax(-/-)Bak(-/-) cells, we have constructed an interconnected hierarchical model that accommodates and explains how the intricate interplays between the BCL-2 members dictate cellular survival versus death. BID, BIM, PUMA and NOXA directly induce stepwise, bimodal activation of BAX-BAK. BCL-2, BCL-XL and MCL-1 inhibit both modes of BAX-BAK activation by sequestering activator BH3s and 'BH3-exposed' monomers of BAX-BAK, respectively. Furthermore, autoactivation of BAX and BAK can occur independently of activator BH3s through downregulation of BCL-2, BCL-XL and MCL-1. Our studies lay a foundation for targeting the BCL-2 family for treating diseases with dysregulated apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2221853914,"Modest transcriptional changes caused by genetic or epigenetic mechanisms are frequent in human cancer. Although loss or near-complete loss of the hematopoietic transcription factor PU.1 induces acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in mice, a similar degree of PU.1 impairment is exceedingly rare in human AML; yet, moderate PU.1 inhibition is common in AML patients. We assessed functional consequences of modest reductions in PU.1 expression on leukemia development in mice harboring DNA lesions resembling those acquired during human stem cell aging. Heterozygous deletion of an enhancer of PU.1, which resulted in a 35% reduction of PU.1 expression, was sufficient to induce myeloid-biased preleukemic stem cells and their subsequent transformation to AML in a DNA mismatch repair-deficient background. AML progression was mediated by inhibition of expression of a PU.1-cooperating transcription factor, Irf8. Notably, we found marked molecular similarities between the disease in these mice and human myelodysplastic syndrome and AML. This study demonstrates that minimal reduction of a key lineage-specific transcription factor, which commonly occurs in human disease, is sufficient to initiate cancer development, and it provides mechanistic insight into the formation and progression of preleukemic stem cells in AML."
https://openalex.org/W1893822674,"To contend with hazards posed by environmental fluoride, microorganisms export this anion through F(-)-specific ion channels of the Fluc family. Since the recent discovery of Fluc channels, numerous idiosyncratic features of these proteins have been unearthed, including strong selectivity for F(-) over Cl(-) and dual-topology dimeric assembly. To understand the chemical basis for F(-) permeation and how the antiparallel subunits convene to form a F(-)-selective pore, here we solve the crystal structures of two bacterial Fluc homologues in complex with three different monobody inhibitors, with and without F(-) present, to a maximum resolution of 2.1 Å. The structures reveal a surprising 'double-barrelled' channel architecture in which two F(-) ion pathways span the membrane, and the dual-topology arrangement includes a centrally coordinated cation, most likely Na(+). F(-) selectivity is proposed to arise from the very narrow pores and an unusual anion coordination that exploits the quadrupolar edges of conserved phenylalanine rings."
https://openalex.org/W2126818728,"The tremendous therapeutic potential of peptides has not yet been realized, mainly owing to their short in vivo half-life. Although conjugation to macromolecules has been a mainstay approach for enhancing protein half-life, the steric hindrance of macromolecules often harms the binding of peptides to target receptors, compromising the in vivo efficacy. Here we report a new strategy for enhancing the in vivo half-life of peptides without compromising their potency. Our approach involves endowing peptides with a small molecule that binds reversibly to the serum protein transthyretin. Although there are a few molecules that bind albumin reversibly, we are unaware of designed small molecules that reversibly bind other serum proteins and are used for half-life extension in vivo. We show here that our strategy was effective in enhancing the half-life of an agonist for GnRH receptor while maintaining its binding affinity, which was translated into superior in vivo efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W2123781955,"Numerous DNA assembly technologies exist for generating plasmids for biological studies. Many procedures require complex in vitro or in vivo assembly reactions followed by plasmid propagation in recombination-impaired Escherichia coli strains such as DH5α, which are optimal for stable amplification of the DNA materials. Here we show that despite its utility as a cloning strain, DH5α retains sufficient recombinase activity to assemble up to six double-stranded DNA fragments ranging in size from 150 bp to at least 7 kb into plasmids in vivo. This process also requires surprisingly small amounts of DNA, potentially obviating the need for upstream assembly processes associated with most common applications of DNA assembly. We demonstrate the application of this process in cloning of various DNA fragments including synthetic genes, preparation of knockout constructs, and incorporation of guide RNA sequences in constructs for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) genome editing. This consolidated process for assembly and amplification in a widely available strain of E. coli may enable productivity gain across disciplines involving recombinant DNA work."
https://openalex.org/W1235720436,"Sublethal levels of oxidative stress are commonly associated with various pathophysiological conditions. Cardiomyocytes have the highest content of mitochondria among all cell types, allowing the study of mitochondria in cells surviving oxidative stress and address whether nuclear factor-erythroid-derived 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) can reverse these changes. Mitochondria normally exist in elaborated networks, which were replaced by predominately individual punctuate mitochondria 24 h after exposure to a nonlethal dose of H2O2. Electron microscopy revealed that cells surviving H2O2 show swelling of mitochondria with disorganized cristae and areas of condensation. Measurements of functional mitochondria showed a H2O2 dose-dependent decrease over a course of 5 d. At the protein and mRNA levels, cells surviving H2O2 treatment show a reduction of mitochondrial components, cytochrome c, and cytochrome b. Nrf2 overexpression prevented H2O2 from inducing mitochondria morphologic changes and reduction of cytochrome b/c. Although Nrf2 is known as a transcription factor regulating antioxidant and detoxification genes, Nrf2 overexpression did not significantly reduce the level of protein oxidation. Instead, Nrf2 was found to associate with the outer mitochondrial membrane. Mitochondria prepared from the myocardium of Nrf2 knockout mice are more sensitive to permeability transition. Our data suggest that Nrf2 protects mitochondria from oxidant injury likely through direct interaction with mitochondria.—Strom, J., Xu, B., Tian, X., Chen, Q. M.

https://openalex.org/W1643304876,"A quantitative chemical proteomics approach identified the DNA damage response mediator 53BP1 as a direct reader of the phosphorylated histone variant γH2AX in cells. DNA double-strand break repair involves phosphorylation of histone variant H2AX ('γH2AX'), which accumulates in foci at sites of DNA damage. In current models, the recruitment of multiple DNA repair proteins to γH2AX foci depends mainly on recognition of this 'mark' by a single protein, MDC1. However, DNA repair proteins accumulate at γH2AX sites without MDC1, suggesting that other 'readers' of this mark exist. Here, we use a quantitative chemical proteomics approach to profile direct, phospho-selective γH2AX binders in native proteomes. We identify γH2AX binders, including the DNA repair mediator 53BP1, which we show recognizes γH2AX through its BRCT domains. Furthermore, we investigate the targeting of wild-type 53BP1, or a mutant form deficient in γH2AX binding, to chromosomal breaks resulting from endogenous and exogenous DNA damage. Our results show how direct recognition of γH2AX modulates protein localization at DNA damage sites, and suggest how specific chromatin mark–reader interactions contribute to essential mechanisms ensuring genome stability."

The exopolysaccharide galactosaminogalactan (GAG) contributes to the virulence of A. fumigatus. A co-regulated five-gene cluster has been identified and proposed to encode the proteins required for GAG biosynthesis. One of these genes, sph3, is predicted to encode a protein belonging to the spherulin 4 family, a protein family with no known function. Construction of an sph3-deficient mutant demonstrated that the gene is necessary for GAG production. To determine the role of Sph3 in GAG biosynthesis, we determined the structure of Aspergillus clavatus Sph3 to 1.25 Å. The structure revealed a (β/α)8 fold, with similarities to glycoside hydrolase families 18, 27, and 84. Recombinant Sph3 displayed hydrolytic activity against both purified and cell wall-associated GAG. Structural and sequence alignments identified three conserved acidic residues, Asp-166, Glu-167, and Glu-222, that are located within the putative active site groove. In vitro and in vivo mutagenesis analysis demonstrated that all three residues are important for activity. Variants of Asp-166 yielded the greatest decrease in activity suggesting a role in catalysis.

This study aimed to evaluate the epidemiology of frailty among community-dwelling middle-aged and elderly population and to explore its association with musculoskeletal health in Taiwan.I-Lan Longitudinal Aging Study (ILAS) data were retrieved for this study. Frailty was defined by the Fried's criteria; a comparison of demographic characteristics, physical performance, and body composition, including skeletal muscle mass and bone mineral density (BMD), as well as recent falls, history of hip fractures and the functional status of subjects with different frailty statuses were accomplished.Overall, the data of 1,839 participants (mean age: 63.9±9.3 years, male 47.5%) were obtained for analysis. The prevalence of pre-frailty was 42.3% in men and 38.8% in women, whereas the prevalence of frailty was 6.9% and 6.7% in men and women, respectively. Frailty was significantly associated with older age, the male gender, larger waist circumference, lower skeletal muscle index, lower hip BMD, poorer physical function, poorer nutritional status, and poorer cognitive function. Also, frailty was significantly associated with osteoporosis (OR: 7.73, 95% CI: 5.01-11.90, p<0.001), history of hip fractures (OR: 8.66, 95% CI: 2.47-30.40, p = 0.001), and recent falls (O.R: 2.53, 95% CI: 1.35-4.76, p = 0.004).Frailty and pre-frailty, in Taiwan, was closely associated with recent falls, history of hip fractures and osteoporosis among community-dwelling people 50 years of age and older.

https://openalex.org/W2153694091,"Pathogens utilize effectors to suppress basal plant defense known as PTI (Pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity). However, our knowledge of PTI suppression by filamentous plant pathogens, i.e. fungi and oomycetes, remains fragmentary. Previous work revealed that the co-receptor BAK1/SERK3 contributes to basal immunity against the potato pathogen Phytophthora infestans. Moreover BAK1/SERK3 is required for the cell death induced by P. infestans elicitin INF1, a protein with characteristics of PAMPs. The P. infestans host-translocated RXLR-WY effector AVR3a is known to supress INF1-mediated cell death by binding the plant E3 ligase CMPG1. In contrast, AVR3aKI-Y147del, a deletion mutant of the C-terminal tyrosine of AVR3a, fails to bind CMPG1 and does not suppress INF1-mediated cell death. Here, we studied the extent to which AVR3a and its variants perturb additional BAK1/SERK3-dependent PTI responses in N. benthamiana using the elicitor/receptor pair flg22/FLS2 as a model. We found that all tested variants of AVR3a suppress defense responses triggered by flg22 and reduce internalization of activated FLS2. Moreover, we discovered that AVR3a associates with the Dynamin-Related Protein 2 (DRP2), a plant GTPase implicated in receptor-mediated endocytosis. Interestingly, silencing of DRP2 impaired ligand-induced FLS2 internalization but did not affect internalization of the growth receptor BRI1. Our results suggest that AVR3a associates with a key cellular trafficking and membrane-remodeling complex involved in immune receptor-mediated endocytosis. We conclude that AVR3a is a multifunctional effector that can suppress BAK1/SERK3-mediated immunity through at least two different pathways."

Therefore, our study suggests that J11-Cl may serve as a novel therapeutic agent against IBD.

Although the exact cause of IBD remains to be explored, it appears that several factors may contribute to the development of IBD, including genetic predisposition, an altered and dysregulated immune response, and environmental factors such as food intake and smoking (4Shih D.Q.

Some limitations in drug efficacy may exist because of the combination of factors leading to IBD and varied responses to drugs in individual patients. Therefore, further studies in IBD pathogenesis and development of new drugs for IBD treatment continue to represent important areas of investigation. inflammatory bowel disease 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 chemokine (C-C motif) ligand chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand chemokine (C-X3-C motif) ligand granulocyte colony-stimulating factor granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor 2-hydroxyethyl 5-chloro-4,5-didehydrojasmonate lipopolysaccharide mitogen-activated protein kinase nuclear factor kappa B peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor PPAR response element tumor necrosis factor α. Methyl jasmonate is a member of the plant stress hormone family of jasmonates, the most potent regulator of defense-related mechanisms in plants (6Cesari I.M. Carvalho E. Figueiredo Rodrigues M. Mendonça Bdos S. Amôedo N.D. Rumjanek F.D. Methyl jasmonate: putative mechanisms of action on cancer cells cycle, metabolism, and apoptosis.Int. J. Cell Biol. 2014; 2014572097Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Because of similar partial structure to anti-inflammatory cyclopentenone prostaglandins, methyl jasmonate was selected as the starting material for the synthesis of a series of enone fatty acid-based anti-inflammatory compounds (7Dang H.T. Lee H.J. Yoo E.S. Hong J. Bao B. Choi J.S. Jung J.H. New jasmonate analogues as potential anti-inflammatory agents.Bioorganic Medicinal Chemistry. 2008; 16: 10228-10235Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Although one of the α-haloenone analogues, J7, showed enhanced in vitro anti-inflammatory potency, its activity was not as effective as diclofenac or indomethacin, well-known anti-inflammatory agents in the in vivo study because it quickly degraded to an inactive form. Thereafter, stability-improved analogues including α-chlorinated hydroxy alkyl ester, 2-hydroxyethyl 5-chloro-4,5-didehydrojasmonate (J11-Cl), and α-chlorinated branched alkyl ester, tert-butyl 5-chloro-4,5-didehydrojasmonate were evaluated for their potency. One of these analogues, J11-Cl, displayed higher in vivo efficacy than other methyl jasmonate derivatives in the carrageenan-induced paw edema assay (8Dang H.T. Lee Y.M. Kang G.J. Yoo E.S. Hong J.

The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are ligand-activated nuclear receptors, including three isoforms of PPARα, PPARβ/δ, and PPARγ. They can activate transcription of target genes by binding to PPAR response element (PPRE) after heterodimerization with retinoid X receptor. It has various roles in regulation of genes related to lipid metabolism, insulin sensitization, cell proliferation, and inflammation (9Kota B.P. Huang T.H. Roufogalis B.D.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors.Pharmacol. Rev. 2006; 58: 726-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). One of many functions of PPAR is inhibiting inflammatory actions such as cytokine and chemokine secretion when they are activated by endogenous or synthetic ligands (11Straus D.S. Glass C.K. Anti-inflammatory actions of PPAR ligands: new insights on cellular and molecular mechanisms.Trends Immunol. 2007; 28: 551-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Of importance, PPARγ is highly expressed in the colon; the major tissue expression in epithelial cells and lower expression in macrophages and lymphocytes (12Dubuquoy L. Rousseaux C. Thuru X. Peyrin-Biroulet L. Romano O. Chavatte P. Chamaillard M. Desreumaux P. PPARγ as a new therapeutic target in inflammatory bowel diseases.Gut. 2006; 55: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Important signaling molecules, which mediate various inflammatory processes include mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB). Several studies have reported enhanced expression and phosphorylation of MAPKs in the intestine of IBD patients, suggesting that MAPK inhibitors can be used as anti-inflammatory drugs in this disease (13Kaminska B.

Mitogen activated protein kinases: a role in inflammatory bowel disease?.Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2009; 158: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Activation of the NF-κB pathway plays a crucial role in inflammation by inducing transcription of pro-inflammatory genes (16Tak P.P. Firestein G.S. NF-κB: a key role in inflammatory diseases.J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (3268) Google Scholar, 17Atreya I. Atreya R. Neurath M.F. NF-κB in inflammatory bowel disease.J. Int. Med. 2008; 263: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Increased activation of NF-κB is observed in macrophages and epithelial cells isolated from IBD patients, which correlates with the severity of intestinal inflammation (18Rogler G. Brand K. Vogl D. Page S. Hofmeister R. Andus T. Knuechel R. Baeuerle P.A. Schölmerich J. Gross V. Nuclear factor κB is activated in macrophages and epithelial cells of inflamed intestinal mucosa.Gastroenterology. 1998; 115: 357-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Based on these considerations, we aimed to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of the newly synthesized methyl jasmonate analogue J11-Cl in intestinal inflammation. We studied anti-inflammatory effect of J11-Cl in a murine experimental model of colitis in vivo and assessed its molecular mechanism in murine macrophages and intestinal epithelial cells exposed to inflammatory insults, including lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). Docking experiments were performed using AutoDock Vina 1.1.2 software (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA) against crystal structures of PPARγ and PPARδ. Protein coordinates were downloaded from the Protein Data Bank. The protein crystal structure was prepared for docking by removing native ligand from the ligand binding domain. Then polar hydrogens were added using MGLTools 1.5.4 (The Scripps Research Institute). All ligands were prepared by Chemdraw 12.0 (CambridgeSoft Corp., Cambridge, MA) and MGLTools 1.5.4. The Center of Grid box was calculated by native ligand using Chimera 1.10.1. The size of the grid box (docking space) was confined by the native ligand. Electrostatic charges of the assigned atoms were calculated as Gasteiger charges. After docking simulation, the analysis and visual investigation of ligand-protein interactions of docking schemes were performed using PyMol v1.7 (Schrodinger LLC, New York, NY). Also, LigandScout 3.12 (Inte:Ligand, Austria, Europe) was used to study pharmacophores. Before exploring the amino acid that forms hydrogen bonds with ligand, MMFF94 minimization was performed. We focused on key amino acid residues of the hydrophilic region of the ligand binding domain (PPARγ: Tyr-473, Ser-289 etc, PPARβ/δ: Tyr-437, His-413, His-287) for successful docking. Docking success was evaluated by the lowest affinity value. The NCM460 cells (3 × 104 cells per well seeded in 48-well plates) were transfected with 0.03 μg of PPRE-X3-TK luc plasmid and 0.3 μg of PPARα, PPARβ/δ, PPARγ expression vector (all constructs were kindly provided by Dr. Hae Young Chung, Pusan National University, Busan, Korea) using Lipofectamine 3000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After incubation for 24 h, cells were treated with vehicle (DMSO), 50 μm J11-Cl, 10 μm WY14643, GW0742, or rosiglitazone (Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 h. Luciferase activities were measured using One-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega) with a luminometer (Berthold Technologies GmbH & Co. KG, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Male C57BL/6 mice (6–7-week-old) were purchased from Samtako Co. Ltd. (Osan, Korea) and acclimatized to the animal care facility for at least 7 days before the experiments. Animals were housed in an air-conditioned atmosphere under a 12-h light/dark cycle and given free access to standard rodent chow (Samtako) and water. The animal study protocols used in this study were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Pusan National University. For induction of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis, 7–8-week-old mice were given 3% (w/v) DSS (MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA) in drinking water for 11 days. Mice were treated daily with J11-Cl (50 mg·kg−1) or vehicle (1% DMSO (Duchefa, Haarlem, Netherlands) and 5% cremophor (Sigma-Aldrich) in saline) by intraperitoneal injection. The mice were monitored daily for mortality and clinical symptoms such as rectal bleeding and diarrhea. The degree of symptoms was graded on a scale of 0–4. The mice were euthanized when clinical symptoms of colitis were manifested during the 11-day period. After euthanasia, the mouse colon was excised, and segments of the transverse colon were fixed immediately in 10% buffered formalin solution. Tissues were embedded in paraffin and stained with H&E to study histological changes and observed using microscope (Olympus Corp., Tokyo, Japan) and photographed with Moticam 3.0 MP Color Digital Camera (Motic, Causeway Bay, Hong Kong) and motic images plus 2.0 software. Formalin-fixed colon tissues were embedded in paraffin and sectioned. After deparaffinized with xylene (Duksan Pure Chemicals, KyungKi-do, Korea), tissues on the slides were rehydrated with ethanol (Merk Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA). For antigen retrieval, slides were placed in heated Tris/EDTA buffer (pH 9.0) (Bioworld Technology, St. Souis Park, MN). After blocking for 1 h with normal rabbit serum (Vector Laboratories), tissues were incubated for 2 h with 1/50 diluted anti-neutrophil antibody, NIMP-R14 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA). Antibody binding were detected using a biotinylated secondary antibody and ABC reagent from Vectastain Elite ABC kit. Next, sections were treated with peroxidase substrate solution and counterstained with hematoxylin. Finally, sections were mounted using VectaMount mounting medium (all purchased from Vector Laboratories). Stained tissues were observed using microscope (Olympus) and photographed with Moticam 3.0 MP Color Digital Camera (Motic) and motic images plus 2.0 software. Formalin-fixed colon tissues were embedded in paraffin and sectioned. After deparaffinized with xylene (Duksan Pure Chemicals), sections were rehydrated with ethanol (Merck Millipore Corp.) and then placed in heated Tris/EDTA buffer (pH 9.0) (Bioworld Technology) for antigen retrieval. After blocking for 1 h with normal goat serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA), sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 1/200 diluted anti-CD3 antibody (Abcam) and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 1/2500 diluted FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Bethyl Laboratories, Inc., Montgomery, TX). Finally, sections were mounted using Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories). Stained tissues were observed using Axioskop (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) and photographed with MetaMorph® software. Murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7 was obtained from American Type Tissue Culture (Rockville, MD), human non-transformed human colonic epithelial cells NCM460 were obtained from INCELL Corp. (San Antonio, TX), and human leukemia cells HL-60 were obtained from Korean Cell Line Bank (KCLB®, Seoul, Korea). RAW264.7 and NCM460 were cultured in DMEM with high glucose and HL-60 was cultured in RPMI, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 100 units·ml−1 penicillin, and 100 μg·ml−1 streptomycin (all from Hyclone Inc.), at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Total protein extracts from homogenized mouse colon tissues and whole cell lysates of RAW264.7 and NCM460 cells were prepared in lysis buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails. Protein concentration was measured by the Pierce® BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford) and equal amounts of protein extracts were subjected to 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membranes were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in 1× Tris-buffered saline with Tween-20 buffer (TBS-T) for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with one of following primary antibodies: COX-2 rabbit polyclonal (sc-7951, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), pThr202/Tyr204-ERK1/2 rabbit polyclonal (no. 9101, Cell Signaling), ERK1/2 (no. 9102, Cell Signaling), pThr183/Tyr185-SAPK/JNK rabbit polyclonal (no. 9251, Cell Signaling), SAPK/JNK rabbit polyclonal (no. 9252, Cell Signaling), pThr180/Tyr182-p38 rabbit polyclonal (no. 9211, Cell Signaling), p38 rabbit polyclonal (no. 9212, Cell Signaling), pSer536-NF-κB p65 rabbit monoclonal (no. 3033, Cell Signaling), β-actin (A5441, Sigma-Aldrich). After the membranes were washed for 40 min with 1× TBS-T, membranes were incubated with an appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Enzo Life Sciences, NY) for 2 h at room temperature. Bound antibodies were detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate Kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Murine inflammatory cytokines were quantified using a multi-analyte ELISArray (SABiosciences, Qiagen, Inc.). In brief, 6–7 colon tissues from each group of mice were lysed with protein lysis buffer, and the lysates were incubated with capture antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. After three washes, samples were re-incubated with biotinylated detection antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. After another three washes, samples were incubated with avidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate for 30 min in the dark. After addition of stop solution, optical density was evaluated on a spectrophotometer (iMarkTM Microplate Reader, Bio-Rad Labs.) at 450 nm. Total RNA was prepared from cultured cells using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen) and from colon tissues of mice using TRIzol® Reagent (Ambion). An equal amount of RNA (1 μg) was transcribed into cDNA, using RT-&GOTM Mastermix (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH) with an oligo (dT) primer (ELPIS Biotech Inc., Daejeon, Korea). Real-time PCR was performed on a Thermal Cycler Dice Real Time System using SYBR® Premix Ex TaqTM (Takara Bio Inc., Otsu, Shiga, Japan). Each reaction was performed in triplicate or quadruplicate. The PCR primer sequences were designed according to the gene sequences reported in GenBankTM and were chemically synthesized. Expression of mouse GAPDH, IL-6, IL-8, and human GAPDH, CCL20, CXCL2, CXCL3, and CX3CL1 was estimated by quantitative real-time PCR using the following primers. Mouse GAPDH forward primer: 5′-CTC ACT GGC ATG GCC TTC CG-3′ and reverse primer: 5′-ACC ACC CTG TTG CTG TAG CC-3′; mouse IL-6 forward primer: 5′-GGA CTG ATG CTG GTG ACA AC-3′ and reverse primer: 5′-TCC ACG ATT TCC CAG AGA AC-3′; mouse IL-8 forward primer: 5′-ACG TGT CCC CAA GTA ACG GA-3′ and reverse primer: 5′-TCA GAA GCC AGC GTT CAC C-3′; human GAPDH forward primer: 5′-CGC TCT CTG CTC CTC CTG TT-3′ and reverse primer: 5′-CCA TGG TGT CTG AGC GAT GT-3′; human CCL20 forward primer: 5′-GAC TGC TGT CTT GGA TAC AC-3′ and reverse primer: 5′-GAT TTG CGC ACA CAG ACA AC-3′; human CXCL2 forward primer: 5′-CCA ACT GAC CAG AAG GAA GG-3′ and reverse primer: 5′-GAT GCT CAA ACA CAT TAG GCG-3′; human CXCL3 forward primer: 5′-TCA CTG AAC TGC GCT GCC AG-3′ and reverse primer: 5′-TCT TCC CAT TCT TGA GTG TGG C-3′; human CX3CL1 forward primer: 5′-TAT CAC TCC TGT CCC TGA CG-3′ and reverse primer: 5′-GCT CTG GTA GGT GAA CAT GG-3′. Relative gene expression was determined by the difference in the CT values of the target genes after normalization to the RNA input level, using a CT value of GAPDH. Relative quantification was represented by the 2−▵▵CT calculation. Migration assay was performed using Cultrex® Cell Migration Assay kits (Trevigen Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) according to the manufacturer's instruction. In brief, NCM460 cells (1 × 105 cells per well seeded in 24-well plate) were stimulated with 10 ng·ml−1 TNF-α after pretreatment of 50 μm J11-Cl for 30 min. HL-60 cells were loaded in uncoated Boyden chambers (5 × 104 cells per chamber). After 24-h incubation, migrated cells were dissociated by cell dissociation buffer with calcein-AM and relative fluorescence unit was measured using GLOMAX multi detection system (Promega). Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism version 5.03 for Windows (GraphPad Software). Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. Difference in survival was shown by Kaplan-Meier plot. The log-rank test was used to compare significant survival difference. Group data were compared by t test or 1-way or 2-way analysis of variance followed by multiple comparisons test. The nonparametric Mann Whitney U test was used to compare clinical symptom of colitis. Considering structural similarity between J11-Cl and the endogenous PPARγ ligand 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) (19Rotondo D. Davidson J. Prostaglandin and PPAR control of immune cell function.Immunology. 2002; 105: 20-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), we investigated whether J11-Cl can bind to PPARγ in the same manner as 15d-PGJ2. Docking simulation of J11-Cl to PPARγ showed that the polar side chain including a hydroxyl group is located in the hydrophilic domain and the other non-polar alkyl chain is located in the hydrophobic region of the ligand binding domain of PPARγ (Fig. 1A), which displays very similar topology with that of 15d-PGJ2 (Fig. 1B). It was reported that the cocrystal structure of 15d-PGJ2 exhibits a hydrogen bond between the carboxyl group of 15d-PGJ2 and the amino acid residue Tyr-473. A covalent bond between the β-carbon of the enone moiety of 15d-PGJ2 and the amino acid residue Cys-285 is also indicated. Docking simulation of J11-Cl also suggested formation of hydrogen bonds with Tyr-473 and His-449. The amino acid residues Tyr-473 and His-449 are also key residues for hydrogen bonding of rosiglitazone in the ligand binding domain of PPARγ (Fig. 1C). Therefore, docking simulation indicated that J11-Cl binds to the ligand binding domain of PPARγ in a same manner as 15d-PGJ2 and rosiglitazone, and key amino acid residues Tyr-473 and His-449 are involved in hydrogen bonding between J11-Cl and PPARγ. The cocrystal structure of GW0742 and PPARβ/δ (PDB 3TKM) was selected as a control model to investigate the interaction between J11-Cl and PPARβ/δ. Docking simulation of J11-Cl suggested formation of hydrogen bonds of the hydroxyl group of J11-Cl with Tyr-437, His-413, and His-287 of PPARβ/δ (Fig. 1D). Similar to the case of docking simulation to PPARγ, the polar side chain of J11-Cl is located in the hydrophilic domain and the other non-polar alkyl chain is located in the hydrophobic region of the ligand binding domain of PPARβ/δ. It was reported that the carboxyl group of GW0742 forms hydrogen bonds with Tyr-437, His-413, and His-287 of PPARβ/δ (Fig. 1E). Tyr-437 is the common key amino acid residue shared both in PPARγ and PPARβ/δ. When the docking topologies of rosiglitazone and GW0742 were simulated to be identical to each cocrystal structures, the affinity scores were −8.3 kcal/mol (Fig. 1C) and −11.0 kcal/mol (Fig. 1E), respectively. Whereas those of J11-Cl to PPARγ and PPARβ/δ were −6.3 kcal/mol (Fig. 1A) and −6.6 kcal/mol (Fig. 1D), respectively. Therefore, J11-Cl may be expected to show higher relative docking affinity to PPARγ (−6.3 kcal/mol) than PPARβ/δ (−6.6 kcal/mol) compared with their standard control rosiglitazone (−8.3 kcal/mol) and GW0742 (−11.0 kcal/mol), respectively. Next we tested whether J11-Cl regulates transcriptional activity of PPARs, luciferase assays for three PPARs were performed. Human colonic epithelial cells (NCM460) transfected with PPRE-X3-TK luc plasmid (PPRE-luc) and PPARα, PPARβ/δ or PPARγ expression vector were treated with vehicle, J11-Cl, or positive controls for each PPAR (WY14643 for PPARα, GW0742 for PPARβ/δ, rosiglitazone for PPARγ). When the cells were transfected with PPRE-luc and PPARα or PPARβ/δ, luciferase activities were significantly increased by only positive controls. Although docking simulation of J11-Cl suggested formation of hydrogen bonds of J11-Cl with PPARβ/δ (Fig. 1D), luciferase activities of PPARβ/δ were not significantly increased by J11-Cl. However, when the cells were transfected with PPRE-luc and PPARγ, luciferase activities were significantly increased by J11-Cl as well as rosiglitazone (∼2.34-fold increase in J11-Cl and 2.54-fold in rosiglitazone) (Fig. 2). These results indicate that J11-Cl increases transcriptional activity of PPARγ. To evaluate anti-inflammatory effects of J11-Cl in vivo, we used a mouse model of colitis. One group of mice was treated with vehicle, and the other group of mice was treated with J11-Cl with the supply of 3% DSS in drinking water. Fig. 3A indicated that J11-Cl significantly increased survival of mice compared with the vehicle control. Moreover, body weight loss of J11-Cl-treated mice was less severe than that of vehicle-treated mice, and rectal bleeding and diarrhea were relieved by J11-Cl treatment (Fig. 3, B–D). Histological analysis indicated that tissue damage was less severe in the colon from J11-Cl-treated mice than that from the vehicle control (Fig. 4A). Moreover, infiltration of neutrophils and T cells into the inflamed site was inhibited in J11-Cl-treated mice compared to the vehicle control (Fig. 4, B and C). Taken together, these results suggest that J11-Cl has a protective role against colonic inflammation.FIGURE 4Tissues from J11-Cl treated mice showed less severe colonic inflammation.

https://openalex.org/W1959914164,"Both mucin 1 (MUC1) and galectin-3 are known to be overexpressed in various malignant tumors and associated with a poor prognosis. It has been extensively reported that MUC1 is involved in potentiation of growth factor-dependent signal transduction. Because some carbohydrate moieties carried on MUC1 change to preferable ones for binding of galectin-3 in cancer cells, we speculated that MUC1-mediated signaling may occur through direct binding of galectin-3. Immunochemical studies showed that the distribution of galectin-3 coincided with that of MUC1 in various human tumor tissues but not in human nonmalignant tissues, and the level of galectin-3 retained on the surface of various cancer cells paralleled that of MUC1. Treatment of MUC1-expressing cells with galectin-3 induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt following enhanced phosphorylation of MUC1 C-terminal domain, consistently promoting tumor cell malignancy. It is also noted that this enhanced phosphorylation occurred independently of EGF receptor-mediated signaling in both EGF receptor- and MUC1-expressing cells, and multivalency of galectin-3 was important for initiation of MUC1-mediated signaling. Expectedly, both silencing of endogenous galectin-3 and treatment with galectin-3 antagonists down-regulated cell proliferation of MUC1-expressing cells. These results suggest that the binding of galectin-3 to MUC1 plays a key role in MUC1-mediated signaling. Thus, constitutive activation of MUC1-mediated signaling in an autocrine/paracrine manner caused by ligation of galectin-3 promotes uncontrolled tumor cell malignancy. This signaling may be another MUC1-mediated pathway and function in parallel with a growth factor-dependent MUC1-mediated signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2097707404,"ClC-3 is a member of the CLC family of anion channels and transporters, for which multiple functional properties and subcellular localizations have been reported. Since alternative splicing often results in proteins with diverse properties, we investigated to what extent alternative splicing might influence subcellular targeting and function of ClC-3. We identified three alternatively spliced ClC-3 isoforms, ClC-3a, ClC-3b, and ClC-3c, in mouse brain, with ClC-3c being the predominant splice variant. Whereas ClC-3a and ClC-3b are present in late endosomes/lysosomes, ClC-3c is targeted to recycling endosomes via a novel N-terminal isoleucine-proline (IP) motif. Surface membrane insertion of a fraction of ClC-3c transporters permitted electrophysiological characterization of this splice variant through whole-cell patch clamping on transfected mammalian cells. In contrast, neutralization of the N-terminal dileucine-like motifs was required for functional analysis of ClC-3a and ClC-3b. Heterologous expression of ClC-3a or ClC-3b carrying mutations in N-terminal dileucine motifs as well as WTClC-3c in HEK293T cells resulted in outwardly rectifying Cl− currents with significant capacitive current components. We conclude that alternative splicing of Clcn3 results in proteins with different subcellular localizations, but leaves the transport function of the proteins unaffected. ClC-3 is a member of the CLC family of anion channels and transporters, for which multiple functional properties and subcellular localizations have been reported. Since alternative splicing often results in proteins with diverse properties, we investigated to what extent alternative splicing might influence subcellular targeting and function of ClC-3. We identified three alternatively spliced ClC-3 isoforms, ClC-3a, ClC-3b, and ClC-3c, in mouse brain, with ClC-3c being the predominant splice variant. Whereas ClC-3a and ClC-3b are present in late endosomes/lysosomes, ClC-3c is targeted to recycling endosomes via a novel N-terminal isoleucine-proline (IP) motif. Surface membrane insertion of a fraction of ClC-3c transporters permitted electrophysiological characterization of this splice variant through whole-cell patch clamping on transfected mammalian cells.

We therefore compared antimicrobial resistance, selected virulence factors and genotypes of S. aureus from nasal carriage and clinical infection in Southwest Nigeria. Non-duplicate S. aureus isolates were obtained from infection (n = 217) and asymptomatic carriers (n = 73) during a cross sectional study in Lagos and Ogun States, Nigeria from 2010–2011. Susceptibility testing was performed using Vitek automated systems. Selected virulence factors were detected by PCR. The population structure was assessed using spa typing. The spa clonal complexes (spa-CC) were deduced using the Based Upon Repeat Pattern algorithm (BURP). Resistance was higher for aminoglycosides in clinical isolates while resistances to quinolones and tetracycline were more prevalent in carrier isolates. The Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) was more frequently detected in isolates from infection compared to carriage (80.2 vs 53.4%; p<0.001, chi2-test). Seven methicillin resistant S. aureus isolates were associated with spa types t002, t008, t064, t194, t8439, t8440 and t8441. The predominant spa types among the methicillin-susceptible S. aureus isolates were t084 (65.5%), t2304 (4.4%) and t8435 (4.1%). spa-CC 084 was predominant among isolates from infection (80.3%, n = 167) and was significantly associated with PVL (OR = 7.1, 95%CI: 3.9–13.2, p<0.001, chi2- test). In conclusion, PVL positive isolates were more frequently detected among isolates from infection compared to carriage and are associated with spa-CC 084."
https://openalex.org/W1616645721,"Elevated high sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) is a marker for systemic inflammation and a risk marker for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ACVD), and has also been associated with periodontitis. Inter-individual variation for hsCRP in periodontitis has been shown. ANRIL is the strongest genetic susceptibility locus for both periodontitis and ACVD, and it is speculated that genetic variation in ANRIL may modulate inflammatory processes. Therefore, we explored the possible association between hsCRP plasma levels and a leading ANRIL single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in periodontitis patients and controls. 171 healthy subjects with North European descent (115 periodontitis and 56 controls) were included in this case-control study. hsCRP levels were determined and subjects were genotyped for the leading ANRIL SNP rs1333048. In a multivariate analysis, periodontitis, female gender, increasing BMI and homozygosity for the major allele (AA-genotype) of rs1333048 were significantly associated with elevated hsCRP plasma levels (p = 0.012, p = 0.004, p = 0.007 and p = 0.003, respectively). Periodontitis patients with rs1333048 AA-genotype showed higher levels of hsCRP than those carrying the minor C allele (median: 4.5 mg/L vs. 1.6 mg/L, padjusted = 0.007). This study is the first to show that, in addition to gender and BMI, also a leading SNP in ANRIL is explanatory for inter-individual variation in hsCRP levels in periodontitis patients of North European descent."
https://openalex.org/W1829842954,"Proximity logging is a new tool for understanding social behavior as it allows for accurate quantification of social networks. We report results from field calibration and deployment tests of miniaturized proximity tags (Encounternet), digital transceivers that log encounters between tagged individuals. We examined radio signal behavior in relation to tag attachment (tag, tag on bird, tag on saline-filled balloon) to understand how radio signal strength is affected by the tag mounting technique used for calibration tests. We investigated inter-tag and inter-receiver station variability, and in each calibration test we accounted for the effects of antennae orientation. Additionally, we used data from a live deployment on breeding barn swallows (Hirundo rustica erythrogaster) to analyze the quality of the logs, including reciprocal agreement in dyadic logs. We evaluated the impact (in terms of mass changes) of tag attachment on the birds. We were able to statistically distinguish between RSSI values associated with different close-proximity (<5 m) tag-tag distances regardless of antennae orientation. Inter-tag variability was low, but we did find significant inter-receiver station variability. Reciprocal agreement of dyadic logs was high and social networks were constructed from proximity tag logs based on two different RSSI thresholds. There was no evidence of significant mass loss in the time birds were wearing tags. We conclude that proximity loggers are accurate and effective for quantifying social behavior. However, because RSSI and distance cannot be perfectly resolved, data from proximity loggers are most appropriate for comparing networks based on specific RSSI thresholds. The Encounternet system is flexible and customizable, and tags are now light enough for use on small animals (<50 g)."
https://openalex.org/W2149161597,"Tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic (TRAP) transporters are secondary transporters that have evolved an obligate dependence on a substrate-binding protein (SBP) to confer unidirectional transport. Different members of the DctP family of TRAP SBPs have binding sites that recognize a diverse range of organic acid ligands but appear to only share a common electrostatic interaction between a conserved arginine and a carboxylate group in the ligand. We investigated the significance of this interaction using the sialic acid-specific SBP, SiaP, from the Haemophilus influenzae virulence-related SiaPQM TRAP transporter. Using in vitro, in vivo, and structural methods applied to SiaP, we demonstrate that the coordination of the acidic ligand moiety of sialic acid by the conserved arginine (Arg-147) is essential for the function of the transporter as a high affinity scavenging system. However, at high substrate concentrations, the transporter can function in the absence of Arg-147 suggesting that this bi-molecular interaction is not involved in further stages of the transport cycle. As well as being required for high affinity binding, we also demonstrate that the Arg-147 is a strong selectivity filter for carboxylate-containing substrates in TRAP transporters by engineering the SBP to recognize a non-carboxylate-containing substrate, sialylamide, through water-mediated interactions. Together, these data provide biochemical and structural support that TRAP transporters function predominantly as high affinity transporters for carboxylate-containing substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2246615985,"The dNTP triphosphohydrolase SAMHD1 is a nuclear antiviral host restriction factor limiting HIV-1 infection in macrophages and a major regulator of dNTP concentrations in human cells. In normal human fibroblasts its expression increases during quiescence, contributing to the small dNTP pool sizes of these cells. Down-regulation of SAMHD1 by siRNA expands all four dNTP pools, with dGTP undergoing the largest relative increase. The deoxyguanosine released by SAMHD1 from dGTP can be phosphorylated inside mitochondria by deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK) or degraded in the cytosol by purine nucleoside phosphorylase. Genetic mutations of dGK cause mitochondrial (mt) DNA depletion in noncycling cells and hepato-cerebral mtDNA depletion syndrome in humans. We studied if SAMHD1 and dGK interact in the regulation of the dGTP pool during quiescence employing dGK-mutated skin fibroblasts derived from three unrelated patients. In the presence of SAMHD1 quiescent mutant fibroblasts manifested mt dNTP pool imbalance and mtDNA depletion. When SAMHD1 was silenced by siRNA transfection the composition of the mt dNTP pool approached that of the controls, and mtDNA copy number increased, compensating the depletion to various degrees in the different mutant fibroblasts. Chemical inhibition of purine nucleoside phosphorylase did not improve deoxyguanosine recycling by dGK in WT cells. We conclude that the activity of SAMHD1 contributes to the pathological phenotype of dGK deficiency.

Synthesis of dNTPs occurs through two pathways, de novo synthesis of dNDPs in the cytosol by ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) 3The abbreviations used are: RNRribonucleotide reductaseSAMHD1sterile α motif/histidine-aspartate domain-containing protein 1dCKdeoxycytidine kinaseTK1cytosolic thymidine kinaseTK2mitochondrial thymidine kinasedGKdeoxyguanosine kinasePNPpurine nucleoside phosphorylaseCdRdeoxycytidineGdRdeoxyguanosinep53R2p53-inducible R2 subunit of ribonucleotide reductaseR2ribonucleotide reductase subunit 2R1ribonucleotide reductase subunit 1mtmitochondria. followed by phosphorylation to dNTPs by nucleoside diphosphate kinase and salvage of deoxyribonucleosides by two parallel sets of deoxynucleoside and -nucleotide kinases in the cytosol and in mitochondria (2Reichard P. Interactions between deoxyribonucleotide and DNA synthesis.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 349-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). The rate-limiting step of the salvage pathway is the phosphorylation of deoxyribonucleosides to their monophosphates, catalyzed by thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) and deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) outside mitochondria and thymidine kinase 2 (TK2) and deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK) inside mitochondria. The substrate specificity of each pair of enzymes permits the phosphorylation of all physiological deoxyribonucleosides in both instances (3Eriksson S. Munch-Petersen B. Johansson K. Eklund H. Structure and function of cellular deoxyribonucleoside kinases.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1327-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Degradation of deoxyribonucleotides is carried out by 5′-nucleotidases that dephosphorylate nucleoside monophosphates to deoxyribonucleosides, inverting the kinase reactions. Deoxyribonucleoside kinases and 5′-nucleotidases generate substrate cycles that regulate the exchange of deoxyribonucleosides across the plasma membrane, thus modulating the overall dNTP pool size (4Bianchi V.

This effect is particularly marked in quiescent or differentiated cells where the level of SAMHD1 is higher than during proliferation. The combination of synthetic and catabolic reactions provides a fine cyclic regulation of dNTP pools in tune with nuclear DNA replication. Pool sizes expand at the onset of S-phase when the request for dNTPs suddenly increases and diminish when DNA replication is completed and ribonucleotide reduction is turned off by degradation of the RNR small subunit R2. In the absence of SAMHD1 the cyclic variation of dNTP pools is lost, and the pools remain high also when the frequency of S-phase cells is low (10Franzolin E. Pontarin G. Rampazzo C. Miazzi C.

Interactions between deoxyribonucleotide and DNA synthesis.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 349-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Moreover, dGTP is highly mutagenic (29Darè E. Zhang L.H. Jenssen D. Bianchi V. Molecular analysis of mutations in the hprt gene of V79 hamster fibroblasts: effects of imbalances in the dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP pools.J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 514-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), is prone to oxidative damage, and in the oxidized form can be incorporated into DNA, reducing DNA polymerase γ replication fidelity with destabilizing consequences (30Nakabeppu Y. Oka S. Sheng Z. Tsuchimoto D. Sakumi K. Programmed cell death triggered by nucleotide pool damage and its prevention by MutT homolog-1 (MTH1) with oxidized purine nucleoside triphosphatase.Mutat.

Trace amounts of 8-oxo-dGTP in mitochondrial dNTP pools reduce DNA polymerase γ replication fidelity.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 2174-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). An exception to the advantages of small dGTP pools is provided by rat tissue mitochondria, reported to contain huge amounts of dGTP (32Song S. Pursell Z.F. Copeland W.C. Longley M.J. Kunkel T.A. Mathews C.K. DNA precursor asymmetries in mammalian tissue mitochondria and possible contribution to mutagenesis through reduced replication fidelity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 4990-4995Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The control of dGTP concentration so far has been considered to result from a balance between the efficiency of dGTP de novo synthesis and the catabolic action of 5′-nucleotidases cdN and cN-II, the two main intracellular 5′-nucleotidases degrading dGMP (4Bianchi V. Spychala J. Mammalian 5′-nucleotidases.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46195-46198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and of purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) that degrades the deoxyguanosine produced by the nucleotidases (Fig. 1). The large effects of SAMHD1 ablation on the concentration of dGTP in various types of mammalian cells show that an important piece of the puzzle was missing. SAMHD1 limits the size of the dGTP pool, especially in quiescent cells, which in culture seem to produce more dGTP than they need. Cells contain two separate dGTP pools, a very small mitochondrial pool enclosed within the mt inner membrane, and a 10-fold larger extramitochondrial pool distributed between the cytosol and nucleus. The two pools communicate through nucleotide (33Di Noia M.A. Todisco S. Cirigliano A. Rinaldi T. Agrimi G. Iacobazzi V. Palmieri F.

Chem. 2008; 283: 16437-16445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, the presence of a mitochondrial salvage pathway that converts deoxyguanosine (GdR) to dGTP suggests that the import of dGTP from the cytoplasm does not suffice for mtDNA synthesis. Indeed, genetic deficiency of dGK causes a mtDNA depletion syndrome with a specific hepato-cerebral phenotype (38Mandel H. Szargel R. Labay V. Elpeleg O. Saada A. Shalata A. Anbinder Y. Berkowitz D. Hartman C. Barak M. Eriksson S. Cohen N. The deoxyguanosine kinase gene is mutated in individuals with depleted hepatocerebral mitochondrial DNA.Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). As is the case with other forms of mtDNA depletion syndrome, the enzyme deficiency targets differentiated cells that have small dNTP pools. However, the tissue-specific effects typical of dGK deficiency remain unexplained. The mtDNA depletion in dGK-mutated individuals is commonly attributed to an insufficient supply of dGTP, an explanation based on limited direct experimental evidence published before the discovery of SAMHD1 (39Saada A. Mitochondrial deoxyribonucleotide pools in deoxyguanosine kinase deficiency.Mol. Genet. Metab. 2008; 95: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Wishing to understand how SAMHD1 interacts with other enzymes in the regulation of dNTP pools, we set out to investigate its impact on the mt pools of cells with defective mt salvage of purine deoxyribonucleosides. We found that dGK deficiency reduces mt dGTP in human fibroblasts only moderately but causes mt dNTP imbalances and mtDNA depletion during quiescence. SAMHD1 down-regulation by siRNA transfection restores mt pool balance and boosts mtDNA copy number, compensating the mtDNA depletion to various degrees in different mutant lines. Interestingly, the activity of SAMHD1 in the nucleus affects the mt dNTP pool by reducing the cellular dGTP content. We propose that inside mitochondria dGK is required to recycle the GdR released from extramitochondrial dGTP by SAMHD1.

https://openalex.org/W2136518783,"Circadian rhythms are endogenous, entrainable oscillations of physical, mental and behavioural processes in response to local environmental cues such as daylight, which are present in the living beings, including humans. Circadian rhythms have been related to cardiovascular function and pathology. However, the role that circadian clock genes play in heart development and function in a whole animal in vivo are poorly understood. The Drosophila cryptochrome (dCry) is a circadian clock gene that encodes a major component of the circadian clock negative feedback loop. Compared to the embryonic stage, the relative expression levels of dCry showed a significant increase (>100-fold) in Drosophila during the pupa and adult stages. In this study, we utilized an ultrahigh resolution optical coherence microscopy (OCM) system to perform non-invasive and longitudinal analysis of functional and morphological changes in the Drosophila heart throughout its post-embryonic lifecycle for the first time. The Drosophila heart exhibited major morphological and functional alterations during its development. Notably, heart rate (HR) and cardiac activity period (CAP) of Drosophila showed significant variations during the pupa stage, when heart remodeling took place. From the M-mode (2D + time) OCM images, cardiac structural and functional parameters of Drosophila at different developmental stages were quantitatively determined. In order to study the functional role of dCry on Drosophila heart development, we silenced dCry by RNAi in the Drosophila heart and mesoderm, and quantitatively measured heart morphology and function in those flies throughout its development. Silencing of dCry resulted in slower HR, reduced CAP, smaller heart chamber size, pupal lethality and disrupted posterior segmentation that was related to increased expression of a posterior compartment protein, wingless. Collectively, our studies provided novel evidence that the circadian clock gene, dCry, plays an essential role in heart morphogenesis and function."
https://openalex.org/W1840393137,"Biogenesis of the iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster is an indispensable process in living cells. In mammalian mitochondria, the initial step of the Fe-S cluster assembly process is assisted by the NFS1-ISD11 complex, which delivers sulfur to scaffold protein ISCU during Fe-S cluster synthesis. Although ISD11 is an essential protein, its cellular role in Fe-S cluster biogenesis is still not defined. Our study maps the important ISD11 amino acid residues belonging to putative helix 1 (Phe-40), helix 3 (Leu-63, Arg-68, Gln-69, Ile-72, Tyr-76), and C-terminal segment (Leu-81, Glu-84) are critical for in vivo Fe-S cluster biogenesis. Importantly, mutation of these conserved ISD11 residues into alanine leads to its compromised interaction with NFS1, resulting in reduced stability and enhanced aggregation of NFS1 in the mitochondria. Due to altered interaction with ISD11 mutants, the levels of NFS1 and Isu1 were significantly depleted, which affects Fe-S cluster biosynthesis, leading to reduced electron transport chain complex (ETC) activity and mitochondrial respiration. In humans, a clinically relevant ISD11 mutation (R68L) has been associated in the development of a mitochondrial genetic disorder, COXPD19. Our findings highlight that the ISD11 R68A/R68L mutation display reduced affinity to form a stable subcomplex with NFS1, and thereby fails to prevent NFS1 aggregation resulting in impairment of the Fe-S cluster biogenesis. The prime affected machinery is the ETC complex, which showed compromised redox properties, causing diminished mitochondrial respiration. Furthermore, the R68L ISD11 mutant displayed accumulation of mitochondrial iron and reactive oxygen species, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, which correlates with the phenotype observed in COXPD19 patients."

Despite advances in clinical and genetic studies, the details of the pathological roles of APRIL in IgA nephropathy (IgAN) remain to be fully defined. The present study aimed to further assess the pathological role of APRIL using a mouse model of IgAN. Mice with IgAN designated “grouped ddY” (gddY) were intraperitoneally administered an anti-APRIL monoclonal antibody (anti-APRIL Ab) or control IgG (Control Ab) twice each week for 2 weeks starting during the early stage of IgAN (6–7 weeks of age). Urinary albumin, serum IgA, and glomerular IgA deposition were evaluated. We further assessed the inflammatory responses during treatment by measuring the levels of the chemokine fractalkine (FKN) and its receptor CX3CR1 as well as the level of peripheral blood monocytosis. Anti-APRIL Ab treatment significantly decreased albuminuria and tissue damage combined with decreases in serum IgA levels and deposition of glomerular IgA. In contrast, the abundance of IgA+/B220+ or CD138+/B220+ B cells in the spleen and bone marrow, respectively, was unchanged. Treating gddY mice with anti-April Ab reduced the overexpression of FKN/CX3CR1 in the kidney and the increase in the population of circulating Gr1−/CD115+ monocytes. The size of the population of Gr1−/CD115+ monocytes correlated with renal FKN and urinary albumin levels. Moreover, mice treated with anti-APRIL Ab exhibited reduced progression of IgAN, serum IgA levels, and glomerular IgA deposition as well as an attenuated inflammatory process mediated by FKN-associated activation of monocytes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to implicate the APRIL signal transduction pathway in the pathogenesis of nephrogenic IgA production.

The Posturomed was equipped with a triggering mechanism to enable unexpected, horizontal platform perturbations. A force platform was used to quantify Center of Pressure (COP) excursions for two time intervals: interval 1 (0-70 ms post perturbation) and interval 2 (71-260 ms post perturbation). Dynamic balance tests were performed in single leg stances in medio-lateral and anterior-posterior perturbation directions. Inter- and intra-day reliability were assessed descriptively using Bland-Altman plots and inferentially using tests for systematic error and intra-class-correlations. With regard to the mean COP excursions for every subject and all intervals, some cases revealed significant differences between measurement sessions, however, none were considered relevant. Furthermore, intra class correlation coefficients reflected high magnitudes, which leads to the assumption of good relative reliability. However, analyzing inter- and intra-day reliability using Bland-Altman plots revealed one exception: intra-day comparisons for the anterior-posterior direction in interval 2, which points towards possible learning effects. In summary, results reflected good overall reliability with the exception of certain intra-day comparisons in the anterior-posterior perturbation direction, which could indicate learning effects in those particular conditions."

Such tumors express the phosphorylated isoform of the β-cell differentiation transcription factor HLXB9. It is not known how phospho-HLXB9 acts as an oncogenic factor in insulin-secreting β-cell tumors (insulinomas). In this study we investigated the binding partners and target genes of phospho-HLXB9 in mouse insulinoma MIN6 β-cells. Co-immunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometry showed a significant association of phospho-HLXB9 with the survival factor p54nrb/Nono (54-kDa nuclear RNA-binding protein, non-POU-domain-containing octamer). Endogenous phospho-HLXB9 co-localized with endogenous Nono in the nucleus. Overexpression of HLXB9 decreased the level of overexpressed Nono but not endogenous Nono. Anti-phospho-HLXB9 chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-Seq) identified the c-Met inhibitor, Cblb, as a direct phospho-HLXB9 target gene. Phospho-HLXB9 occupied the promoter of Cblb and reduced the expression of Cblb mRNA. Cblb overexpression or HLXB9 knockdown decreased c-Met protein and reduced cell migration. Also, increased phospho-HLXB9 coincided with reduced Cblb and increased c-Met in insulinomas of two mouse models of menin loss. These data provide mechanistic insights into the role of phospho-HLXB9 as a pro-oncogenic factor by interacting with a survival factor and by promoting the oncogenic c-Met pathway. These mechanisms have therapeutic implications for reducing β-cell proliferation in insulinomas by inhibiting phospho-HLXB9 or its interaction with Nono and modulating the expression of its direct (Cblb) or indirect (c-Met) targets. Our data also implicate the use of pro-oncogenic activities of phospho-HLXB9 in β-cell expansion strategies to alleviate β-cell loss in diabetes."

Stimuli such as IL-1 have been shown to overcome this inhibitory action and enable the resumption of transcription elongation machinery by an unknown mechanism. Using mass spectrometry and in vitro phosphorylation analyses, we demonstrate that NKRF is phosphorylated within 3 different domains in unstimulated HeLa cells. Phosphoamino acid mapping and mutation analysis of NKRF further suggest that only Ser phosphorylation within aa 421-429 is regulated by IL-1 stimulation. In copurification studies, aa 421-429 is required for interactions between NKRF, 5'→3‘ exoribonuclease 2 (XRN2) and the negative elongation factor (NELF)-E in HeLa cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments further show that IL-1 stimulation leads to decrease in NKRF aa 421-429 phosphorylation and dissociation of NELF-E and XRN2 by concomitant resumption of transcription elongation of a synthetic reporter or the endogenous NKRF target gene, IL-8. Together, NKRF phosphorylation modulates promoter-proximal transcription elongation of NF-κB/NKRF-regulated genes via direct interactions with elongation complex in response to specific stimuli.—Rother, S., Bartels, M., Schweda, A.

Two reviewers scored the possibility of liver metastasis on different sets of liver images (T2WI, DWI, and combined T2WI and DWI) and APCT and reached a conclusion by consensus for different analytic results. Imaging features from rectal MRI were also analyzed. The diagnostic performances of CT and an additional liver scan to detect liver metastasis were compared. Multivariate logistic regression to determine independent predictors of liver metastasis among rectal MRI features and tumor markers was performed. This retrospective study was approved by the Institutional Review Board, and the requirement for informed consent was waived.All sets of liver images were more effective than APCT for detecting liver metastasis, and DWI was the most effective. Perivascular stranding and anal sphincter invasion were statistically significant for liver metastasis (p = 0.0077 and p = 0.0471), while extramural vascular invasion based on MRI (mrEMVI) was marginally significant (p = 0.0534).The addition of non-contrast-enhanced liver imaging, particularly DWI, to initial rectal MRI in rectal cancer patients could facilitate detection of liver metastasis without APCT.

Here, we showed that microwave-assisted RCA reactions catalyzed by either of the four thermostable DNA polymerases were accelerated over 4-folds compared with conventional RCA. Furthermore, the temperatures of the individual buffer components were specifically influenced by microwave heating. We concluded that microwave heating accelerated isothermal RCA of DNA because of the differential heating mechanisms of microwaves on the temperatures of reaction components, although the overall reaction temperatures were the same."
https://openalex.org/W1833774184,"Bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon L pers.) is one of the most geographically adapted and utilized of the warm-season grasses. However, bermudagrass adaptation to the Northern USA is limited by freeze damage and winterkill. Our study provides the first large-scale analyses of gene expression in bermudagrass regenerative crown tissues during cold acclimation. We compared gene expression patterns in crown tissues from highly cold tolerant “MSU” and susceptible “Zebra” genotypes exposed to near-freezing temperatures. Suppressive subtractive hybridization was used to isolate putative cold responsive genes Approximately, 3845 transcript sequences enriched for cold acclimation were deposited in the GenBank. A total of 4589 ESTs (3184 unigenes) including 744 ESTs associated with the bermudagrass disease spring dead spot were printed on microarrays and hybridized with cold acclimated complementary Deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA). A total of 587 differentially expressed unigenes were identified in this study. Of these only 97 (17%) showed significant NCBI matches. The overall expression pattern revealed 40% more down- than up-regulated genes, which was particularly enhanced in MSU compared to Zebra. Among the up-regulated genes 68% were uniquely expressed in MSU (36%) or Zebra (32%). Among the down-regulated genes 40% were unique to MSU, while only 15% to Zebra. Overall expression intensity was significantly higher in MSU than in Zebra (p value ≤ 0.001) and the overall number of genes expressed at 28 days was 2.7 fold greater than at 2 days. These changes in expression patterns reflect the strong genotypic and temporal response to cold temperatures. Additionally, differentially expressed genes from this study can be utilized for developing molecular markers in bermudagrass and other warm season grasses for enhancing cold hardiness."

In this paper I study changes in satellite night lights across Mexican municipalities after the arrival of large drug trafficking organizations in the period 2000-2010. After accounting for state trends and differences in political regimes, results indicate no significant change in night lights after the arrival of these illegal firms. Estimated coefficients are precise, robust, and similar across different drug trafficking organizations."
https://openalex.org/W2129915699,"The use of pathways and gene interaction networks for the analysis of differential expression experiments has allowed us to highlight the differences in gene expression profiles between samples in a systems biology perspective. The usefulness and accuracy of pathway analysis critically depend on our understanding of how genes interact with one another. That knowledge is continuously improving due to advances in next generation sequencing technologies and in computational methods. While most approaches treat each of them as independent entities, pathways actually coordinate to perform essential functions in a cell. In this work, we propose a methodology based on a sparse regression approach to find genes that act as intermediary to and interact with two pathways. We model each gene in a pathway using a set of predictor genes, and a connection is formed between the pathway gene and a predictor gene if the sparse regression coefficient corresponding to the predictor gene is non-zero. A predictor gene is a shared neighbor gene of two pathways if it is connected to at least one gene in each pathway. We compare the sparse regression approach to Weighted Correlation Network Analysis and a correlation distance based approach using time-course RNA-Seq data for dendritic cell from wild type, MyD88-knockout, and TRIF-knockout mice, and a set of RNA-Seq data from 60 Caucasian individuals. For the sparse regression approach, we found overrepresented functions for shared neighbor genes between TLR-signaling pathway and antigen processing and presentation, apoptosis, and Jak-Stat pathways that are supported by prior research, and compares favorably to Weighted Correlation Network Analysis in cases where the gene association signals are weak."
https://openalex.org/W2139201426,"Inducible expression systems are widely employed for the titratable control of gene expression, yet molecules inadvertently present in the growth medium or synthesized by the host cells can alter the response profile of some of these systems. Here, we explored the quantitative impact of these residual inducers on the apparent response properties of inducible systems. Using a simple mathematical model, we found that the presence of residual inducer shrinks the apparent dynamic range and causes the apparent Hill coefficient to converge to one. We also found that activating systems were more sensitive than repressing systems to the presence of residual inducer and the response parameters were most heavily dependent on the original Hill coefficient. Experimental interrogation of common titratable systems based on an L-arabinose inducible promoter or a thiamine pyrophosphate-repressing riboswitch in Escherichia coli confirmed the predicted trends. We finally found that residual inducer had a distinct effect on “all-or-none” systems, which exhibited increased sensitivity to the added inducer until becoming fully induced. Our findings indicate that residual inducer or repressor alters the quantitative response properties of titratable systems, impacting their utility for scientific discovery and pathway engineering."
