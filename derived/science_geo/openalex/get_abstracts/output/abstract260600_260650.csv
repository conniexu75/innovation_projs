https://openalex.org/W1995214889,"Stromal interacting molecule 1 (STIM1) is a Ca(2+) sensor that conveys the Ca(2+) load of the endoplasmic reticulum to store-operated channels (SOCs) at the plasma membrane. Here, we report that STIM1 binds TRPC1, TRPC4 and TRPC5 and determines their function as SOCs. Inhibition of STIM1 function inhibits activation of TRPC5 by receptor stimulation, but not by La(3+), suggesting that STIM1 is obligatory for activation of TRPC channels by agonists, but STIM1 is not essential for channel function. Through a distinct mechanism, STIM1 also regulates TRPC3 and TRPC6. STIM1 does not bind TRPC3 and TRPC6, and regulates their function indirectly by mediating the heteromultimerization of TRPC3 with TRPC1 and TRPC6 with TRPC4. TRPC7 is not regulated by STIM1. We propose a new definition of SOCs, as channels that are regulated by STIM1 and require the store depletion-mediated clustering of STIM1. By this definition, all TRPC channels, except TRPC7, function as SOCs."
https://openalex.org/W2144252460,"Formation of cancerous translocations requires the illegitimate joining of chromosomes containing double-strand breaks (DSBs). It is unknown how broken chromosome ends find their translocation partners within the cell nucleus. Here, we have visualized and quantitatively analysed the dynamics of single DSBs in living mammalian cells. We demonstrate that broken ends are positionally stable and unable to roam the cell nucleus. Immobilization of broken chromosome ends requires the DNA-end binding protein Ku80, but is independent of DNA repair factors, H2AX, the MRN complex and the cohesion complex. DSBs preferentially undergo translocations with neighbouring chromosomes and loss of local positional constraint correlates with elevated genomic instability. These results support a contact-first model in which chromosome translocations predominantly form among spatially proximal DSBs."

https://openalex.org/W2063936188,"Previous studies have shown that raising cytosolic calcium in myotubes induces increases in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α expression and mitochondrial biogenesis. This finding suggests that the increases in cytosolic calcium in skeletal muscle during exercise may mediate the exercise-induced increase in mitochondria. The initial aim of this study was to determine whether raising calcium in skeletal muscle induces the same adaptations as in myotubes. We found that treatment of rat epitrochlearis muscles with a concentration of caffeine that raises cytosolic calcium to a concentration too low to cause contraction induces increases in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α expression and mitochondrial biogenesis. Our second aim was to elucidate the pathway by which calcium induces these adaptations. Raising cytosolic calcium has been shown to activate calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase in muscle. In the present study raising cytosolic calcium resulted in increases in phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and activating transcription factor-2, which were blocked by the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase inhibitor KN93 and by the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor SB202190. The increases in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α expression and mitochondrial biogenesis were also prevented by inhibiting p38 activation. We interpret these findings as evidence that p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase is downstream of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase in a signaling pathway by which increases in cytosolic calcium lead to increases in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α expression and mitochondrial biogenesis in muscle.

These findings support the hypothesis that increases in cytosolic Ca2+ resulting from release of sarcoplasmic (SR) Ca2+ during excitation-contraction coupling is the signal or one of the signals generated in muscle during exercise that mediates the increase in mitochondrial biogenesis. The initial purpose of this study was to determine whether raising cytosolic Ca2+ in a more biologically relevant model, skeletal muscle, induces an increase in mitochondrial biogenesis similar to that found in myotubes. After finding that raising cytosolic Ca2+ in our skeletal muscle preparation does result in increases in PGC-1α expression and mitochondrial biogenesis, we used this model to try to elucidate the pathway by which the Ca2+-induced increases in PGC-1α and mitochondrial biogenesis are mediated. Both the activity and expression of PGC-1α appear to be regulated by p38 MAPK (7Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 78-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar, 22Knutti D.

Antibody against threonine-phosphorylated protein kinase B was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). The horseradish peroxidase secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Animals—This research was approved by the Animal Studies Committee of Washington University. Male Wistar rats weighing 51–75 g were obtained from Charles River and maintained on a diet of Purina rat chow and water ad libitum. Food was removed at 5:00 p.m. the day before an experiment. Rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (5 mg/100 g of body weight) given intraperitoneally, and the epitrochlearis muscles were removed. These muscles weighed ∼6–8 mg and are sufficiently thin so that oxygenation and substrate supply by diffusion are adequate, as evidenced by maintenance of normal ATP and phosphocreatine concentrations. The rat epitrochlearis contains ∼76% type 2b fibers, 12% type 2a fibers, and 12% type 1 fibers (29Rodnick K.J. Henriksen E.J. James D.E. Holloszy J.O. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C9-C14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Muscle Incubations—Rat epitrochlearis were incubated in oxygenated (95% O2, 5% CO2) culture medium containing Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (α-MEM), 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 microunits/ml purified pork insulin, 100 microunits/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml Fungizone. The flasks containing the muscles were maintained at 35 °C in a shaking water bath and gassed continuously with 95% O2, 5% CO2. In one series of experiments, muscles were incubated in culture medium supplemented with 3.5 mm caffeine for 6 h to raise cytosolic Ca2+ concentration by releasing Ca2+ from the SR (20Ojuka E.O.

Physiol. 2003; 94: 1813-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and then allowed to recover for 18 h in oxygenated culture medium in the absence of caffeine. Some muscles were preincubated in culture medium supplemented with 10 μm SB202190 or 10 μm KN93 for 1 h before and during the 6-h caffeine exposure. Muscles recovered for 18 h in culture medium in the absence of KN93, SB202190, and caffeine. Because KN93 and SB202190 are light-sensitive, glass vials containing these compounds were wrapped in foil. The medium was changed every 6 h. At the end of the incubations, muscles were briefly washed in phosphate-buffered saline and clamp-frozen with tongs cooled to the temperature of liquid nitrogen. In another experiment, muscles were frozen after 2, 4, or 6 h of exposure to caffeine or after 6 h of exposure to caffeine and 2 h of recovery. Muscles were subsequently processed for Western blotting or mRNA extraction. p38 MAPK Phosphorylation and Signaling—Epitrochlearis muscles were dissected out and allowed to recover in culture medium for 1 h in a shaking water bath maintained at 35 °C with a gas phase of 95% O2, 5% CO2. Muscles were then incubated in the absence or presence of 10 μm KN93 or 10 μm SB202190 (32Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3957) Google Scholar) for 1 h followed by a 15-min incubation with or without 3.5 mm caffeine in the continued absence or presence of inhibitors. Muscles were then clamp-frozen with tongs cooled to the temperature of liquid nitrogen and kept at –70 °C until they were processed for Western analysis. Western Blotting—Frozen epitrochlearis muscles were homogenized in modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (33Wright D.C. Geiger P.C. Rheinheimer M.J. Han D-H. Holloszy J.O. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: E305-E309Google Scholar), and protein concentration was measured by the method of Lowry et al. (34Lowry O.H. Rosenbrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using a 10% resolving gel, and Western blotting was performed as described previously (33Wright D.C. Geiger P.C. Rheinheimer M.J. Han D-H. Holloszy J.O. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: E305-E309Google Scholar, 35Geiger P.C. Wright D.C. Han D-H. Holloszy J.O. Am. J.

The blots were then incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Antibody-bound protein was detected by ECL. Determination of mRNA—Total RNA was isolated from epitrochlearis muscles using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Caffeine-induced changes in ALAS, citrate synthase, PGC-1α, and COXI mRNAs were determined using semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR as described in detail previously (36Terada S. Wicke S. Holloszy J.O. Han D-H. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2006; 290: 607-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Universal 18S (Ambion, Austin, TX) was used as an internal control. PCR products were run on a 2% agarose gel and visualized with Sybr Green (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Transcript intensity was expressed relative to 18 S rRNA. The following primers were used: δ ALAS, forward (5′-GCTCTTGTTCTCTTCCTGCTTCG-3′) and reverse (5′-CAAACTCGTGCTGGCAATGTATC-3′); citrate synthase, forward (5′-CACAGCCCCTCAACAGTGAAAGC-3′) and reverse (5′-GTAGTCTCGTAACTTCTCATCTGACACG-3′); PGC-1α forward (5′-TGACATAGAGTGTGCTGCCCTG-3′) and reverse (5′-TGGTTCTGAGTGCTAAGACCGCTG-3′); COXI forward (5′-GGAAGCAGTATTCGCCATCAT-3′) and reverse (5′-CGGCCGTAAGTGAGATGAAT-5′). Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as means ± S.E. Differences between two groups were analyzed using unpaired t tests. Comparisons between the means of multiple groups were made using a one-way analysis of variance followed by a post hoc comparison using Fisher's least significant difference method. Mitochondrial Marker Protein and β-Actin Levels in Fresh and Incubated Muscles—A potential problem in studies on incubated epitrochlearis muscles is that decreases in the levels of mitochondrial and other proteins might occur as the result of accelerated proteolysis or reduced protein synthesis during the in vitro incubation. We, therefore, compared the levels of four mitochondrial marker proteins and β-actin in freshly dissected muscles and muscles incubated in vitro for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 1, the levels of these five proteins were similar in the fresh and the incubated muscles. Apparently, the anabolic effects of the growth factors in the fetal calf serum, the amino acids, and the insulin in the incubation medium are sufficient to maintain the muscles in good condition for up to 24 h. Raising Cytosolic Ca2+ Induces an Increase in Mitochondrial Biogenesis in Skeletal Muscle—Previous studies have shown that raising cytosolic Ca2+ induces increases in mitochondrial proteins (17Irrcher I.

Exposure of rat epitrochlearis muscles to 3.5 mm caffeine for 6 h resulted in increases in the mRNAs of PGC-1α, COXI, ALAS, and citrate synthase measured 18 h after caffeine exposure (Fig. 2A). This concentration of caffeine raises cytosolic Ca2+ to a concentration that is too low to cause muscle contraction or a decrease in high energy phosphate levels (37Youn J.H. Gulve E.A. Holloszy J.O. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C555-C561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Wright D.C. Hucker K.A. Holloszy J.O. Han D-H. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). PGC-1α, COXI, and ALAS proteins, which have short half-lives, were also increased 18 h after caffeine exposure (Fig. 2B). In contrast, citrate synthase protein, which appears to have a half-life of ∼6–7 days (39Booth F.W. Holloszy J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 416-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was not increased 18 h after caffeine treatment (Fig. 2B). These findings provide evidence that, as in myotubes (17Irrcher I.

Time Course of Ca2+-induced Increase in PGC-1α Protein—There was no appreciable increase in PGC-1α protein levels in muscles exposed to caffeine for 2, 4, or 6 h (Fig. 8). However, PGC-1α protein level was significantly increased 2 h after the caffeine treatment was completed (Fig. 8). An increase in COXI mRNA preceded the increase in PGC-1α protein, with significant increases detectable in muscles treated with caffeine for either 4 or 6 h (Fig. 9). This finding is compatible with the possibility that activation rather than increased expression of PGC-1α is involved in mediating the early phase of the adaptive response (13Wright D.C. Han D-H.

Among this class of genetically encoded biosensors, reporters for membrane potential have been a particular challenge.

Results Here we report on a fluorescent protein voltage sensor with superior targeting to the mammalian plasma membrane and high responsiveness to membrane potential signaling in excitable cells. Conclusions and Significance This biosensor, which we termed VSFP2.1, is likely to lead to new methods of monitoring electrically active cells with cell type specificity, non-invasively and in large numbers, simultaneously."

Mammals have seven sirtuins, which are localized to various subcellular compartments (reviewed in Ref. 4North B.J. Verdin E. Genome Biol. 2004; 5: 224Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). SIRT2, which is more closely related to the yeast sirtuin Hst2p, is a cytoplasmic deacetylase that is associated with the microtubule network and targets lysine 40 of α-tubulin for deacetylation (4North B.J. Verdin E. Genome Biol. 2004; 5: 224Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 5Afshar G. Murnane J.P. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 234: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 6Bae N.S.

However, the functional significance of lysine 40 acetylation and its regulation by SIRT2 have remained elusive.Recent studies have implicated SIRT2 in the control of cellular proliferation (7Hiratsuka M.

SIRT2 expression is reduced in a high proportion of glioma cell lines. Furthermore, replacement of SIRT2 expression in these cell lines reduced cellular proliferation as measured by colony formation assay (7Hiratsuka M. Inoue T. Toda T. Kimura N. Shirayoshi Y.

These findings suggest that SIRT2 potentially functions as a tumor suppressor gene, because it negatively regulates cellular proliferation. A role for SIRT2 during a novel mitotic stress checkpoint was identified that prevents cells from progressing into mitosis in the presence of microtubule poisons, potentially through regulation of chromatin condensation (9Scolnick D.M.

SIRT2 is phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner, and its stability is regulated by the phosphatase CDC14B (8Dryden S.C. Nahhas F.A. Nowak J.E. Goustin A.S. Tainsky M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3173-3185Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). However, the kinase involved in SIRT2 phosphorylation, and its possible role in regulation of SIRT2 stability are unknown. In yeast, Cdc14p antagonizes Cdk1 activity by dephosphorylating several Cdk1 targets during the transition to mitotic exit (17Bembenek J. Yu H. Front. Biosci. 2003; 8: d1275-d1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that Cdk1 phosphorylates SIRT2 at serine 368, and furthermore, phosphorylation at this site is required for SIRT2-mediated delay in cell cycle progression.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESTissue Culture—HEK 293T, U-87 MG (HTB-14), U20S, and HeLa cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection, grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech, Inc., Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bio-products, Woodland, CA) in the presence of penicillin, streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen).Plasmids and Mutagenesis—Human SIRT2 full-length and variant 2, Cdk1 and cyclin B1 cDNAs were subcloned to generate C-terminal FLAG- or hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged fusions in a derivative of the pcDNA3.1(+) backbone. Wild-type and fragments of human SIRT2 was cloned into pEGFP-C1 vector (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) by standard PCR-based strategies to generate GFP-SIRT2 full-length and deletion mutants. Site-directed mutagenesis for SIRT2 constructs was performed with QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as recommended by the manufacturer. GFP-CDC14A and CDC14B-GFP were kind gifts from Peter K. Jackson. Cyclin B1 cDNA was cloned into DsRed-C1 (Clontech) to generate RFP-cyclin B1. Full-length human SIRT2 cDNAs were cloned into pTrcHis vector (Invitrogen) for production of recombinant His6-SIRT2.Purification of Recombinant SIRT2—DH5αF′IQ bacteria (Invitrogen) were transformed with pTrcHis-SIRT2 and induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 2 h. The resulting His6-tagged protein was purified as described previously (18North B.J. Schwer B. Ahuja N. Marshall B. Verdin E. Methods. 2005; 36: 338-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Recombinant protein was aliquoted and stored at -20 °C.Transient Transfections and Immunoprecipitations—HEK 293T cells were transfected either by the calcium phosphate DNA precipitation method or with FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) and lysed 48 h after transfection in low stringency lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl) in the presence of protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures 1 and 2 (Sigma). FLAG-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2-agarose affinity gel (Sigma), for 2 h at 4 °C from 1 mg of total cell lysate measured by the Dc Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad). Immunoprecipitated material was washed three times for 15 min each in low stringency lysis buffer, and agarose-immune complexes were resuspended in 1× Laemmli buffer.Histone Deacetylase Assays—Immunoprecipitated material was washed for an additional 15 min in SIRT2 deacetylase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 4 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mm dithiothreitol). Both immunoprecipitated material and recombinant SIRT2 were resuspended in 100 μl of SIRT2 deacetylase buffer containing NAD+ (Sigma) and 3H-acetylated histone H4 peptide (amino acids 1–23) (19Emiliani S. Fischle W. Van Lint C. Al-Abed Y. Verdin E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2795-2800Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The enzymatic reactions were started by addition of NAD+. Reactions were incubated for 2 h at room temperature and stopped by adding 25 μl stop solution (0.1 m HCl, 0.16 m acetic acid). Released acetate was extracted in 500 μl of ethyl acetate and vortexed for 15 min. After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 5 min, 400 μl of the ethyl acetate fraction was mixed with 5 ml of scintillation fluid and counted.Western Blotting—Samples were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were blocked with 5% blocking reagent (Bio-Rad) in Tris-buffered saline-Tween (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20), and were probed with anti-FLAG (F7425, Sigma), anti-actin (C4, ICN Biomedicals, Inc., Irvine, CA), and anti-GFP (Livingcolors monoclonal, Clontech) each diluted 1:5000, anti-phospho-serine (Zymed Laboratories Inc., Carlsbad, CA) diluted 1:1000, or anti-SIRT2 (20North B.J.

Secondary detection was performed using horseradish peroxidase-coupled sheep anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences), goat anti-rabbit IgG (Pierce), or goat anti-chicken IgY (Aves Labs, Inc., Tigard, OR) diluted 1:5000 and ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences).Immunofluorescence Microscopy—U2OS cells grown on coverslips were washed twice in PBS for 10 min, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (EMS, Ft. Washington, PA) for 10 min, followed by permeabilization in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. After three washes for 10 min each in PBS, cells were incubated in 10% bovine serum albumin for 10 min and then incubated for 1 h with anti-SIRT2 diluted 1:20 and anti-cyclin B1 (Upstate Biotech) diluted 1:1000 in PBS plus 0.1% Tween 20. Cells were washed three times 10 min in PBS plus 0.1% Tween 20, followed by incubation with goat anti-mouse IgG (Fc specific) TRITC-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma) and goat anti-chicken IgY fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated (Aves Labs, Inc.) both diluted 1:500 in PBS plus 0.1% Tween 20. Cells were washed three times for 10 min each in PBS and once briefly in ddH2O, and then mounted on slides with Gel Mount (Biomeda Corp., Foster City, CA). Confocal images were acquired by laser-scanning confocal microscopy with an Olympus BX60 microscope equipped with a Radiance 2000 confocal setup (Bio-Rad).Cell Proliferation Measurements—The glioma cell line U-87 MG was transfected with vectors for SIRT2-FLAG wild-type, S368A mutant, and the empty vector, along with a vector for DsRed (Clontech) at a ratio of 1:6 to mark transfected cells. 24 h following transfection, cells were washed with PBS, trypsinized to remove cells from the plate, and washed again in PBS twice. Pelleted cells were incubated with 0.1 μm CFSE (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at 37 °C for 10 min. Cells were then washed twice in PBS and either subjected to flow cytometry or plated in culture medium and allowed to grow for 24, 48, or 72 h. Following indicated times, cells were harvested by trypsinization and subjected to flow cytometric analysis. Flow cytometry data were compensated and analyzed by FlowJo software.For time-course cell proliferation analysis, U-87 MG cells were transfected with empty vector, SIRT2-FLAG wild-type, or S368A and S368E mutants. Cells were selected in 800 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen) until non-transfected control cells were no longer viable. Expression of SIRT2-FLAG was assessed by Western blotting. Cells were grown for 2 days in media without selection agent, plated into 12-well plates at 5000 cells per well. Every 48 h, wells were harvested and total cell number was counted.In Vitro Kinase Assay—Reactions were prepared in kinase assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 30 μm ATP, in the presence or absence of 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) containing 3 μg of rSIRT2 and indicated quantity of Cdk1-cyclin B1 (New England Biolabs). Reactions were carried out at 30 °C for 30 min and stopped by addition of 6× Laemmli buffer to a final concentration of 1×.In Vitro Phosphatase Assay—SIRT2-FLAG was immunoprecipitated from transfected HEK 293T as described above. Immunoprecipitated material was washed three times for 15 min with lysis buffer, followed by two times for 15 min with 1× NEB buffer 3 (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Immunoprecipitated material was resuspended in NEB buffer 3 with or without 10 μm sodium pyrophosphate and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, followed by the addition of indicated units of calf intestinal phosphates (CIP, New England Biolabs) and incubated at 37 °C for an additional 30 min. Reactions were stopped by addition of 6× Laemmli buffer to a final concentration of 1× and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described above. For λ-phosphatase treatments, HEK 293T cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl) in the presence of protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, Roche Applied Science). Lysate was treated with or without 200 units of λ-phosphatase (New England Biolabs) at 30 °C for 30 min and stopped by addition of 6× Laemmli buffer to a final concentration of 1× and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described above.Pharmacological Treatments for Cell-cycle Arrest and Cdk1 Inhibition—For S and M phase cell-cycle arrest experiments, HEK 293T cells were treated for 15 h with 2 mm thymidine. Following treatment, cells were washed twice in PBS and replaced in fresh growth medium. Cells were then transfected with SIRT2-FLAG or the empty FLAG vector using FuGENE 6 and incubated for 8 h under standard cell culture conditions. Cells were then retreated in either 2 mm thymidine (for S phase block) or 10 μg/ml Colchicine (Sigma, M phase block) and incubated for 17 h until cells were harvested and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described above, or for flow cytometric analysis. For treatment of cells with Cdk1 inhibitors, HEK 293T cells were transfected with SIRT2-FLAG as described above. 24 h post transfection, cells were treated with 10 μg/ml purvalanol A (Calbiochem), 10 mm alsterpaulone (Calbiochem), or 10 mm U0126 (Cell Signaling Technologies) for 16 h until cells were harvested and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described above.Time-lapse Microscopy—HeLa Cells were plated on 40-mm coverslips (Bioptech) and treated for 15 h with 2 mm thymidine. Following thymidine treatment, cells were washed in PBS and grown in fresh media. Following replacement of fresh media, cells were transfected with vectors for GFP-SIRT2 and RFP-cyclin B1 and grown for in standard culture conditions for 8 h, at which time cells were retreated for 17 h in 2 mm thymidine. Cells were washed twice in PBS and grown for 6 h in fresh media, at which time cells were placed in a closed culture chamber system (Bioptech) with CO2-independent media and subjected to time-lapse microscopy with images acquired every 60 s on a Nikon ellipse TE300 microscope controlled by Metamorph software.Hyperploidy Measurements—Polyclonal U-87 MG cells stably expressing SIRT2-FLAG proteins were subjected to 200 nm nocodazole treatment for the indicated times. At each time point, cells were harvested and fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol and stored at -20 °C until flow cytometric analysis was preformed as described previously (21Krishan A. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 66: 188-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (1491) Google Scholar).Tandem Mass Spectrometry—Nanocapillary high-performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization-MS and MS/MS analysis were performed utilizing an Ultimate 2000 high-performance liquid chromatography system equipped with Switchos™ and Famos™ autosampler (Dionex/LC Packings) on-line with a QSTAR XL, QqTOF hybrid mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex). The QSTAR was operated with a nanoelectrospray ion source (Protana) and PicoTip™ emitters (New Objective, Inc.). Protein digest volumes of 2–3 μl were desalted online using a Nano-Precolumn™ (Dionex/LC Packings, C18, 300-Å pore size, 5-μm particle size, 5-mm length, and 300-μm inner diameter), and peptides were separated on a self-packed column (packing material: Phenomenex Jupiter Proteo™; C12 end-capped, 4-μm particle size, 90-Å pore size, 15-cm length, and 75-μm inner diameter). The mobile phase flow rate was 250 nl/min. The column was equilibrated at 2% solvent B for 20 min before sample injection (solvent B: 80% acetonitrile/0.08% formic acid; solvent A: 2% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid). Peptides were separated using a linear gradient of 2–50% solvent B over 20 min, followed by a column cleanup step at 95% solvent B for 5 min. Data were acquired automatically by operating the mass spectrometer in information-dependent acquisition mode, which allowed for a 1-s MS survey scan followed by two 2-s MS/MS scans. Peptides were fragmented by low energy collision-induced dissociation. Nitrogen was used as the collision gas, and the collision energy was automatically adjusted depending on the precursor ion charge state. The mass spectrometer was externally calibrated using product ions of Glu1-Fibrinopeptide B (Sigma). Data analysis was facilitated by employing BioAnalyst software (Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex) and Mascot (Matrix Science). Mass accuracy tolerance windows for Mascot searches were set at ±100 ppm and ±0.1 Da for precursor and product ions masses, respectively. The MS/MS spectra of phosphorylated peptides and their non-phosphorylated counterparts were manually verified. Selected ion chromatograms of phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of peptides spanning amino acid regions 348–380 and 347–380 of SIRT2 were generated to interrogate the high performance liquid chromatography MS/MS data for the presence of precursor ions that were not automatically selected for collision-induced dissociation.RESULTSGeneration of Multiple Isoforms of SIRT2 by Alternative Translational Start Sites—After transfection of HEK 293T cells with a SIRT2 construct, the SIRT2 protein migrated as at least four different species by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A). Lysates of mock-transfected cells were analyzed alongside lysates from SIRT2-FLAG to confirm that the proteins recognized by the FLAG antiserum resulted exclusively from the expression of the SIRT2-FLAG construct.Based on expressed sequence tag sequences obtained from human genome databases, SIRT2 is expressed as two isoforms resulting from alternative splicing. In variant 1, all exons are spliced contributing to a translated protein of 389 amino acids. Variant 2 arises when the second exon is spliced out, placing a stop codon within exon 3 in-frame with the first ATG. Translation is then initiated at the second ATG (amino acid 38 of the full-length SIRT2). The SIRT2 used in our experiments corresponds to variant 1, and we suspected that both ATG codons were being utilized for translation upon expression of this cDNA in HEK 293T cells (Fig. 1B). To test this possibility, we mutated the second ATG into alanine. The two lower molecular weight forms of SIRT2 were no longer present, indicating that both the first and second ATGs are utilized for translation from the exogenously expressed mRNA (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that exogenously expressed SIRT2 can be represented in vivo as two isoforms. Bands of the same size are observed for endogenous SIRT2 (Fig. 1E) suggesting that both ATGs (at position 1 and 38) are utilized for translation of the endogenous protein as well.SIRT2 Is a Phosphoprotein—Each of the two major isoforms expressed from the exogenous SIRT2-FLAG plasmid migrated as two species. To determine if phosphorylation was responsible for the observed multiple migratory species, immunoprecipitated SIRT2-FLAG was treated in vitro with CIP. Incubation of SIRT2-FLAG with increasing concentrations of CIP resulted in a faster migratory species, indicating that phosphorylation is responsible for the various species observed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1D). As a control, we performed the in vitro phosphatase assay with the phosphatase inhibitor sodium pyrophosphate (Na4P2O7) to confirm that the loss of the slower migratory species was due to the activity of CIP (Fig. 1D). To determine if endogenous SIRT2 is phosphorylated, we treated cell lysates with λ-phosphatase. Following phosphatase treatment, we observed a slower migrating form of SIRT2 consistent with SIRT2 being phosphorylated in vivo (Fig. 1E).To determine which amino acids are phosphorylated in SIRT2, we probed immunoprecipitated SIRT2-FLAG with antibodies specific for phosphorylated serine, threonine, and tyrosine. SIRT2 reacted strongly with the anti-phosphoserine, to a lesser degree with the anti-phosphothreonine, and did not react with the anti-phosphotyrosine antiserum (data not shown). To confirm that the anti-phosphoserine antibody was recognizing specifically a phosphorylated protein, we treated the immunoprecipitated SIRT2-FLAG with or without CIP followed by Western blotting with anti-phosphoserine antisera. The anti-phosphoserine signal observed on immunoprecipitated SIRT2-FLAG was absent following CIP treatment (Fig. 1G). These results confirm phosphorylation of SIRT2 and suggest that SIRT2 is phosphorylated on serine residue(s).SIRT2 Is Phosphorylated on Serine 368—To determine the site of SIRT2 phosphorylation, we generated deletion mutants of SIRT2 fused to the C terminus of GFP. GFP-SIRT2 fusion proteins containing amino acids 314–389 of SIRT2 showed multiple bands consistent with phosphorylation (Fig. 2A, lanes 7–11). However, fusions lacking the C terminus of SIRT2 (amino acids 360–389), migrated as a single band protein (Fig. 2A, lanes 2–6). This data suggested that the alteration in migration of SIRT2 might be due to phosphorylation within the region of SIRT2 corresponding to amino acids 360–389. Analysis of this region revealed several potential serine and threonine phosphorylation sites (Fig. 2B). Mutation of each serine and threonine residue in this segment showed that serine 368 modification caused a change in mobility of SIRT2, consistent with phosphorylation of this site (Fig. 2C). However, because a low intensity slowly migrating band remained for the mutant S368A, we suspect that serine 368 is not the only site leading to migratory differences in SIRT2 (Fig. 2C).FIGURE 2Phosphorylation of SIRT2 on serine 368.

To determine the phosphorylation status of exogenous SIRT2 during the cell cycle, we arrested cells in S phase or M phase. In agreement with a possible role for Cdk1 in SIRT2 phosphorylation, the phosphorylation of exogenous SIRT2 was cell-cycle-dependent, because SIRT2 phosphorylation increased during mitotic arrest (Fig. 3A). Endogenous SIRT2 was also hyperphosphorylated during mitotic arrest (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that SIRT2 phosphorylation is, in part, dependent on the stage of the cell cycle.FIGURE 3Mitotic induction of serine 368 phosphorylation. A, HEK 293T cells were mock transfected or transfected with SIRT2-FLAG and arrested in either the G1/S or M phase of the cell cycle. Cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed by Western blotting with antisera specific for FLAG. B, HEK 293T cells were allowed to grow asynchronously or arrested in either the G1/S or M phase of the cell cycle. Cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed by Western blotting with an antiserum specific for SIRT2. C, HEK 293T cells were mock transfected or transfected with either SIRT2-FLAG wild-type or S368A mutant, and treated with or without 10 μg/ml purvalanol A for 16 h. Cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed by Western blotting with an antiserum specific for FLAG. D, HEK 293T cells were mock treated or treated with 10 μg/ml purvalanol A, 10 mm alsterpaulone, or 10 mm U0126 for 16 h. Cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed by Western blotting with an antiserum specific for SIRT2. Relative levels of hypo- to hyperphosphorylated SIRT2 were quantified.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine if SIRT2 is phosphorylated by Cdk1 in vivo, we transfected cells with vectors encoding SIRT2-FLAG wild-type, S368A mutant, or the empty vector (FLAG) and tested the effect of purvalanol A, an inhibitor of Cdk1 activity. Phosphorylation of SIRT2 was reduced by purvalanol A treatment as demonstrated by an increase in the amount of faster migrating SIRT2 (Fig. 3C). As expected, no change was observed for the SIRT2 S368A mutant (Fig. 3C). purvalanol A was recently demonstrated to target the kinase MEK1 in addition to Cdk1. To rule out the possibility that MEK1 was targeting SIRT2 at serine 368, we tested the effect of purvalanol A, alsterpaulone (a second unrelated Cdk1 inhibitor), and U0126 (an MEK1 inhibitor) on the phosphorylation status of endogenous SIRT2. Consistent with our previous results, we found that both Cdk1 inhibitors caused a decrease in SIRT2 phosphorylation, but the MEK1 inhibitor (U0126) did not have any"

https://openalex.org/W2136963804,"Background Almost 15 years after its formulation, evidence for the neuro-functional dissociation between a dorsal action stream and a ventral perception stream in the human cerebral cortex is still based largely on neuropsychological case studies. To date, there is no unequivocal evidence for separate visual computations of object features for performance of goal-directed actions versus perceptual tasks in the neurologically intact human brain. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to test explicitly whether or not brain areas mediating size computation for grasping are distinct from those mediating size computation for perception. Methodology/Principal Findings Subjects were presented with the same real graspable 3D objects and were required to perform a number of different tasks: grasping, reaching, size discrimination, pattern discrimination or passive viewing. As in prior studies, the anterior intraparietal area (AIP) in the dorsal stream was more active during grasping, when object size was relevant for planning the grasp, than during reaching, when object properties were irrelevant for movement planning (grasping>reaching). Activity in AIP showed no modulation, however, when size was computed in the context of a purely perceptual task (size = pattern discrimination). Conversely, the lateral occipital (LO) cortex in the ventral stream was modulated when size was computed for perception (size>pattern discrimination) but not for action (grasping = reaching). Conclusions/Significance While areas in both the dorsal and ventral streams responded to the simple presentation of 3D objects (passive viewing), these areas were differentially activated depending on whether the task was grasping or perceptual discrimination, respectively. The demonstration of dual coding of an object for the purposes of action on the one hand and perception on the other in the same healthy brains offers a substantial contribution to the current debate about the nature of the neural coding that takes place in the dorsal and ventral streams."

Mitochondrial oxidant production may begin during ischemia prior to reperfusion because reducing equivalents accumulate and promote superoxide production. We utilized a ratiometric redox-sensitive protein sensor (heat shock protein 33 fluorescence resonance energy transfer (HSP-FRET)) to assess oxidant stress in cardiomyocytes during simulated ischemia. HSP-FRET consists of the cyan and yellow fluorescent protein fluorophores linked by the cysteine-containing regulatory domain from bacterial HSP-33. During ischemia, ROS-mediated oxidation of HSP-FRET was observed, along with a decrease in cellular reduced glutathione levels. These findings were corroborated by measurements using redox-sensitive green fluorescent protein, another protein thiol ratiometric sensor, which became 93% oxidized by the end of simulated ischemia. However, cell death did not occur during ischemia, indicating that this oxidant stress is not sufficient to induce death before reperfusion. However, interventions that attenuate ischemic oxidant stress, including antioxidants or scavengers of residual O2 that attenuate/prevent ROS generation during ischemia, abrogated cell death during simulated reperfusion. These findings reveal that, in isolated cardiomyocytes, sublethal H2O2 generation during simulated ischemia regulates cell death during simulated reperfusion, which is mediated by the reperfusion oxidant burst.

Previous studies have examined the cellular consequences of tissue ischemia, but the molecular mechanisms that regulate cell death in this syndrome are still not fully understood. When blood flow to a tissue is interrupted, the extent of injury is influenced by the severity and duration of the ischemic challenge such that longer periods of ischemia are associated with more extensive cell death (1Reimer K.A.

Restoration of blood flow relieves the ischemic stress, although morphological evidence of tissue injury appears only after the oxygen supply has been restored (3McCord J.M. N. Engl. J.

Interventions that attenuate this reperfusion burst, including pre- and post-conditioning, therapeutic hypothermia during reperfusion, and chemical antioxidants, all confer protection against cell death (14Argaud L.

This indicates that the ROS burst at reperfusion is both necessary and sufficient to induce cell death in cardiomyocytes. However, there is still uncertainty about the events occurring during ischemia that prime the cell to undergo this lethal burst in oxidant stress within the first few minutes of reperfusion. Previous studies indicate that mitochondrial oxidant generation increases during cellular hypoxia and suggest that ROS generation may occur during ischemia prior to reperfusion (17Duranteau J.

These observations led us to hypothesize that ROS production begins during ischemia and to investigate whether this oxidant stress contributes to the cell death during reperfusion. The assessment of intracellular oxidant stress in real time during ischemia and reperfusion is technically challenging. Spin trap probes coupled with EPR spectroscopy can potentially identify the radical species involved, but high concentrations of spin trap are required, and the radicals detected frequently represent secondary products generated by the interaction of primary species with iron or copper ions (for review, see Refs. 15Vergely C. Maupoil W. Clermont G. Bril A. Rochette L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 420: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A number of EPR studies suggest that a burst of radicals is produced at the onset of reperfusion based on the appearance of radical adducts in the coronary sinus during the initial reperfusion period (5Ambrosio G.

Res. 2001; 35: 475-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, because blood flow is absent during ischemia, it is difficult to assess ROS production prior to reperfusion using spin trap probes and EPR. Moreover, many spin trap probes are primarily sensitive to oxidants released to the extracellular space (24Zhao H. Joseph J. Fales H.M. Sokoloski E.A. Levine R.L. Vasquez-Vivar J. Kalyanaraman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5727-5732Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), which confounds their ability to assess intracellular oxidant stress. Alternative methods using commercially available oxidant-sensitive probes such as dichlorofluorescin are subject to nonspecific oxidation (25Hockberger P.E. Skimina T.A. Centonze V.E. Lavin C. Chu S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 35253-35257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and the fluorescence of the probes decreases under the conditions of low pH that accompany ischemia. Furthermore, oxidant-sensitive probes can potentially access multiple intracellular compartments, making it difficult to identify the intracellular sites affected by oxidative stress (27Swift L.M. Sarvazyan N. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: H982-H990Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, ROS-sensitive fluorophores do not provide ratiometric measures of oxidant stress, making it difficult to ascertain whether changes in fluorescence intensity are due to changes in oxidant production, to changes in pH, or to a change in the steady-state levels of intracellular dye. In this study, we sought to assess cellular oxidant stress during ischemia using a novel redox-sensitive fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) protein expressed in the cytosol of cardiomyocytes. This probe consists of cyan and yellow fluorescent protein fluorophores connected by a redox-sensitive hinge peptide. The hinge region consists of the cysteine-containing regulatory domain of HSP-33, a bacterial heat shock protein with chaperone activity that is activated by the oxidation of thiols in the regulatory domain (28Jakob U. Muse W. Eser M. Bardwell J.C. Cell. 1999; 96: 341-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Using the regulatory domain of HSP-33 for the HSP-FRET sensor therefore yields a ratiometric sensor of protein thiol oxidation state. When expressed in the cytosol, this sensor (HSP-FRET) permits optical interrogation of the reduction state of the thiol pool in that compartment (29Guzy R.D. Hoyos B. Robin E. Chen H. Liu L.

These measurements were confirmed using a second redoxsensitive ratiometric protein redox sensor (roGFP) (30Dooley C.T. Dore T.M. Hanson G.T. Jackson W.C. Remington S.J. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol.

This mutant of green fluorescent protein is capable of undergoing reversible changes in cysteine dithiol formation, permitting its calibration in vivo and allowing quantification of oxidant stress during ischemia. We applied these approach in cultured cells subjected to simulated ischemia in a flow-through chamber to assess the extent of oxidant stress during ischemia-reperfusion and the significance of this stress for cell death during reperfusion.

HSP-FRET—The HSP-FRET redox sensor was constructed by cloning cDNA encoding yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) between the NheI and BglII restriction sites in pECFP-N1 (Clontech) and the redox-regulated domain from HSP-33 (positions 218-287) via EcoRI and BamHI sites. Proper orientation of the construct was verified by bidirectional sequencing. Plasmids were amplified by overnight growth in transformed DH5α cells (Invitrogen) and isolated by column purification (EndoFree plasmid maxi kit, Qiagen Inc.). Cardiomyocytes were transfected with the HSP-FRET construct using Gene-PORTER transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's recommendations and 3 μg of DNA and 15 μl of GenePORTER per coverslip. Intracellular fluorescence was detectable within 24 h, and cell studies were carried out within 48 h. roGFP Redox Sensor—roGFP was generated by introducing the C48S/Q80R/S147C/Q204C mutations into the pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech) using the Stratagene QuikChange kit. This construct was then subcloned into the Ad5CMV K-NpA vector between the KpnI and NotI sites (ViraQuest Inc.), re-sequenced, and used to generate a recombinant adenovirus. Coverslips containing 105 cells were incubated with virus for 2 h in serum-free medium and allowed to express the protein for 24-36 h. Simulated Ischemia-Reperfusion—Studies were carried out as the cells were perfused under controlled oxygen and CO2 conditions. The base-line perfusate containing NaCl (117 mm), KCl (4 mm), NaHCO3 (18 mm), MgSO4 (0.76 mm), NaH2PO4 (1 mm), CaCl2 (1.21 mm), and glucose (5.6 mm) was bubbled with 5% CO2, 21% O2, and 74% N2. The same solution was used during simulated reperfusion. To simulate ischemia, cells superfused with buffer containing NaCl (108.9 mm), KCl (8 mm), NaHCO3 (21.4 mm), MgSO4 (0.76 mm), NaH2PO4 (1 mm), and CaCl2 (1.21 mm) without glucose was bubbled with 20% CO2, 0%O2, and 80% N2 (pH 6.8). The O2/CO2 environment of the cells was controlled by mounting the coverslip carrying the cells into a flow-through chamber composed of two coverslips separated by a stainless steel spacer ring (Penn-Century, Inc., Philadelphia, PA). The chamber was filled and perfused with medium that had been continuously bubbled with O2/CO2/N2 mixtures gases in a heated water-jacketed gas equilibration column (Radnoti Glass Technology, Inc.), mounted above the stage of an inverted microscope (Nikon), and connected to the flow-through chamber with stainless steel tubing to minimize contamination by room air. Using this system, cells were superfused with medium supplied from the equilibration column, where it was equilibrated with different gas mixtures corresponding to base-line or ischemic conditions. The PO2 within the flow-through chamber was measured under simulated ischemic conditions using a porphyrin-based phosphorescence quenching method (35Lo L.W. Koch C.J. Wilson D.F. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 236: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Anoxic Ischemia—Anoxic ischemia was identical to the standard simulated ischemic procedure, except that residual O2 was scavenged from the perfusate by adding sodium lactate (5 mm) and the oxygen scavenger EC-Oxyrase®. EC-Oxyrase is a commercially available enzymatic preparation used to produce anoxic conditions in cell culture by reducing molecular oxygen to water. Control ischemic studies were carried out using the standard ischemic protocol containing sodium lactate (5 mm) without EC-Oxyrase. Fluorescence Imaging—Fluorescent images of cells expressing HSP-FRET were obtained while the cells were perfused at 37 °C using an oil immersion objective (1.3 numerical aperture, ×40). Cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) images were obtained using an emission filter at 470/430 nm, and YFP emission was measured at 535/530 nm. In both cases, excitation was achieved using a 430/425-nm filter. Images of cells expressing roGFP were acquired similarly using excitation at 400 and 490 nm and emission at 535 nm. Images were acquired each minute using a 16-bit cooled CCD camera (Cascade 650); ratiometric images were calculated using MetaFluor imaging software (Universal Imaging). Microscopic fields generally contained one to four cells, the responses of which were individually tracked as regions of interest during the experiment. Each experiment consisted of the averaged response from one to four cells in a single microscopic field. Ratiometric values were normalized to the values in the same cell at the end of the base line, with 100% corresponding to the value at the end of the base line. Cellular GSH/GSSG Measurements—Reduced and oxidized glutathione levels were measured in cell lysates using the BIOXYTECH{regs] GSH/GSSG-412™ kit (Oxis International, Inc., Portland, OR) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Cell Viability—Cell death was assessed in separate experiments using propidium iodide (5 μm), which was added to the perfusate. This probe is excluded from live cells, but enters cells upon disruption of plasma membrane integrity. Fluorescent images were obtained using a ×10 objective (excitation at 555 nm and emission at 605 nm) at the base line; at the end of ischemia; and at 1, 2, and 3 h into reperfusion. Following the 3-h measurement, all cells were permeabilized by adding digitonin (300 μm) to the perfusate for 45 min. Cell death during the experiment was calculated as the percent of the post-digitonin value. Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures. When a statistically significant difference was detected, individual differences were then explored using Student's t test or Newman-Keuls multiple comparison tests. Statistical significance was determined at the p = 0.05 level. Ventricular cardiomyocytes isolated from 10-12-day embryonic chick hearts were grown on glass coverslips at a density of 1 × 105 cells. After 3-4 days in culture, cells were 85-95% confluent and exhibited spontaneous contraction. Coverslips were placed in a flow-through chamber and perfused with balanced salt solutions at 37 °C under controlled oxygen conditions. Cardiomyocytes transiently transfected with the HSP-FRET sensor exhibited a uniform pattern of confocal fluorescence (Fig. 1B) that was indistinguishable in appearance from the pattern observed in cells transfected with a commercially obtained, non-targeted, GFP expression vector (pEGFP-N1) (data not shown). Confocal analysis of the spatial distribution of CFP and YFP fluorescence in cells expressing HSP-FRET revealed uniform correspondence between the two fluorophores, indicating that expression of the intact protein was achieved (data not shown). By individually photobleaching the CFP and YFP moieties, we determined that the FRET transfer ratio for this probe is 4.3%, where a value of zero corresponds to an absence of Förster energy exchange and a value of 100% indicates that emission from the acceptor fluorophore was completely dependent on energy transfer from the donor (data not shown). During base-line perfusion with normoxic medium (21% O2 and 5% CO2), a stable HSP-FRET ratio in the range of 0.6-0.8 was typically observed. To assess the sensitivity of HSP-FRET to oxidant stress, fluorescent images were collected every 20 s for 30 min as the cells were perfused with normoxic medium containing H2O2 or medium alone (time controls) (Fig. 1D). A dose-dependent increase in the fluorescence ratio was detected in cells subjected to exogenous oxidants, indicating that the probe is sensitive to exogenous H2O2. To assess oxidant stress during ischemia, cardiomyocytes transiently expressing HSP-FRET were subjected to base-line normoxic perfusion (20 min) followed by simulated ischemia (30 min) while fluorescent images were collected every 60 s. Within 6 min after switching to ischemia, significant increases in the HSP-FRET ratio were detected (Fig. 2A), consistent with the presence of oxidative stress. The HSP-FRET ratio increased progressively during the first 15 min of ischemia, reaching a maximal change by that time. The increase in the HSP-FRET ratio observed during ischemia was comparable with the increase seen during treatment with 100 μm H2O2, which likely reflected complete oxidation of the sensor. At the end of ischemia, reperfusion with normoxic medium was associated with a marked loss of fluorescence intensity for both CFP and YFP within the first 10 min of reperfusion (data not shown). This loss of fluorescence intensity was not observed in cells treated with antioxidants, suggesting that it reflected hyperoxidation of the sensor protein during the reperfusion oxidant burst. The conditions of ischemia include hypercapnia, induced by equilibration with 20% CO2 that readily enters the cells by diffusion. This creates intracellular acidosis (pH ∼ 6.7), which alone could have altered the structure of HSP-FRET, leading to changes in proximity between YFP and CFP, or altered the fluorescent properties of CFP and/or YFP directly. In either case, this could have influenced the change in the fluorescence ratio that was observed during ischemia. To determine whether these changes in pH could have influenced the response measured during ischemia, control studies were conducted using the same acidic perfusate used for ischemia, except that O2 levels were not decreased (21% O2 and 20% CO2, mock ischemia). Mock ischemia produced a small shift in the fluorescence ratio, but this was significantly less than that observed during hypoxic ischemia. YFP is known to exhibit pH-dependent fluorescent behavior (36Griesbeck O. Baird G.S. Campbell R.E. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29188-29194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar), which may have contributed to this response. To test whether the pH sensitivity of YFP contributed to the ischemic response, the YFP mutant citrine, which exhibits a lesser sensitivity to pH compared with YFP, was subcloned into the HSP-FRET sensor, replacing YFP (36Griesbeck O. Baird G.S. Campbell R.E. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29188-29194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). Significant increases in the citrine HSP-FRET ratio were still observed during ischemia, indicating that the pH sensitivity of YFP was not responsible (data not shown). To determine the extent to which ROS were responsible for the changes in the fluorescence ratio during ischemia, experiments were repeated in the presence of the chemical antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (500 μm). Antioxidant administration was initiated during the base line and was maintained for the remainder of the experiment. When cardiomyocytes expressing HSP-FRET were perfused with medium containing N-acetylcysteine, the ischemia-induced changes in the fluorescence ratio were abrogated (Fig. 2B). This compound acts by increasing the reduction state of thiols in the cell, suggesting that ROS production during ischemia was responsible for the changes in the fluorescence ratio. H2O2 can be generated during ischemia by the dismutation of superoxide by SOD in the cytosol or mitochondria. To determine the contribution of H2O2 to the observed changes in the HSP-FRET fluorescence ratio, cardiomyocytes were transduced with an adenovirus expressing catalase (32Bai J. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4315-4321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), which degrades H2O2. The dose of adenovirus was determined from Western blot studies demonstrating a dose-dependent increase in catalase expression with increasing concentrations of adenovirus (Fig. 2D), and increases in catalase expression throughout the cytosol were confirmed by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2C). Compared with control cells infected with an adenovirus expressing LacZ, cells overexpressing catalase demonstrated a significant attenuation in HSP-FRET oxidation during ischemia (Fig. 2F). Because the HSP-FRET sensor was expressed throughout the cytosol, these results indicate that significant oxidant stress arising from H2O2 occurs in the cytosol during ischemia. The source of cytosolic oxidant stress during ischemia is not known. Mitochondria represent a potential source of ROS generation through their ability to generate superoxide via univalent electron transfer to O2. Superoxide generated from the mitochondrial electron transport chain can potentially be released into the matrix compartment (37Muller F.L. Liu Y.H. Van R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49064-49073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar), where Mn-SOD resides, or to the cytosol via the intermembrane space, where Cu,Zn-SOD can be found (38Okado-Matsumoto A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38388-38393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). To determine the role of H2O2 production in the matrix on the magnitude of oxidant stress in the cytosol during ischemia, catalase was overexpressed in the matrix using an adenovirus containing the mitochondrial targeting sequence for Mn-SOD appended to the catalase cDNA (Fig. 2E) (32Bai J. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4315-4321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Dose-dependent expression was determined by immunoblotting of whole cell protein lysates (Fig. 2D). In cardiomyocytes overexpressing mitochondrial catalase and cytosolic HSP-FRET, there was a significant decrease in oxidant stress detected by ANOVA (p = 0.0013), although only sporadic differences were detected by post hoc analysis during ischemia (Fig. 2G). These results indicate that relatively little of the cytosolic oxidant stress appears to originate fro"

Salvage of glucosamine by the hexosamine pathway to UDP-GlcNAc is reported to suppress T cell function and EAE in mice by an unknown mechanism (12Ma L. Rudert W.A. Harnaha J. Wright M. Machen J.

Rostami A. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 7202-7208Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). De novo biosynthesis of UDP-GlcNAc by the hexosamine pathway utilizes glucose, acetyl-CoA, glutamine, and UTP (see Fig. 1), key allosteric regulators of basic metabolism, suggesting regulation of UDP-GlcNAc supply is integrated with down-stream pathways requiring this sugar-nucleotide. In this regard, the Golgi pathway to β1,6GlcNAc-branched N-glycans is sensitive to cellular UDP-GlcNAc levels (14Sasai K. Ikeda Y. Fujii T. Tsuda T. Taniguchi N. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and plays a role in T cell function (15Demetriou M. Granovsky M. Quaggin S. Dennis J.W. Nature. 2001; 409: 733-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). Mice deficient in Golgi UDP-GlcNAc:β1,6N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (Mgat5) display enhanced delayed-type hypersensitivity, spontaneous kidney autoimmunity after 1 year of age, and increased susceptibility to EAE (15Demetriou M. Granovsky M. Quaggin S. Dennis J.W. Nature. 2001; 409: 733-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). Most transmembrane receptors on mammalian cells are modified by N-glycosylation en route to the cell surface. The N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases I, II, IV, and V, encoded by the genes Mgat1, -2, -4a/b, and -5, act sequentially to transfer N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (GlcNAc) from UDP-GlcNAc to N-glycan intermediates in the medial Golgi, producing mono, bi-, tri-, and tetra-antennary N-glycans, respectively (16Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3776) Google Scholar, 17Schachter H. Glycobiology. 1991; 1: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). Branching and particularly the β1,6GlcNAc-branched tetra-antennary N-glycans are sub-saturating, as Mgat1, -2, -4, and -5 display decreasing affinities for UDP-Glc-NAc, and enzyme concentrations also decline across the pathway (see Fig. 1) (17Schachter H. Glycobiology. 1991; 1: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar).

However, increasing the proportion of tri-antennary structures in Mgat5-deficient cells is sufficient to rescue defects in galectin binding and surface retention of receptors (22Lau K.S. Partridge E.A. Grigorian A. Silvescu C.I. Reinhold V.N. Demetriou M. Dennis J.W. Cell. 2007; 129: 123-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). In addition, the number of N-glycans, an encoded feature of protein sequence (NX(S/T)), contributes to galectin avidity and regulates surface residency of receptors in a selective manner (22Lau K.S.

With increasing hexosamine flux of UDP-GlcNAc through the Golgi to N-glycan Glc-NAc branching, surface galectin binding and retention of glycoproteins with high N-glycan multiplicity (epidermal growth factor, insulin-like growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and basic fibroblast growth factor receptors) are enhanced before those with lower multiplicity (transforming growth factor-β receptor, CTLA-4, and GLUT-4) (22Lau K.S.

This provides a mechanism for metabolic regulation of cellular transitions between growth (i.e. epidermal growth factor, insulin-like growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and basic fibroblast growth factor receptors) and arrest signaling (i.e. transforming growth factor-β receptor, CTLA-4, and GLUT-4) (22Lau K.S.

After TCR activation, endocytosis rates are increased and Src-family kinases and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Erk stimulate hexosamine flux and Golgi processing to β1,6GlcNAc-branched N-glycans, thereby enhancing surface retention of the growth suppressor CTLA-4 (22Lau K.S.

Therefore, β1,6GlcNAc-branched N-glycans regulate different receptors and at two distinct phases of the T cell response, both serving to suppress T cell activation and autoimmune mechanisms. Here we demonstrate that surface β1,6GlcNAc-branched N-glycans on T cells are regulated by the nutrient environment and metabolite supply to the hexosamine pathway. Hexosamine pathway supplements suppress TCR sensitivity, TH1 differentiation, and autoimmunity by increasing N-glycan GlcNAc-branching in T cells. Our results indicate that genetic and environmental contributions to metabolic homeostasis and Golgi processing regulate N-glycan branching, T cell function, and autoimmunity and suggest new avenues for prevention and treatment of autoimmune disease (Fig. 7).

Mouse cells were stained with anti-CD4 (RM4-5), anti-CD8 (53-6.7), anti-CTLA-4 (UC10-4B9), anti-CD28 (37.51), and anti-CD69 (H1.2F3) from eBioscience, Phaseolus vulgaris leukoagglutinating lectin (l-PHA, 4 μg/ml), Lycopersicon esculentum agglutinating lectin (20 μg/ml), and 7-aminoactinomycin D (1 μg/ml) from Sigma. Purified CD3+ T cells (R&D Systems) were labeled with 5 μm 5,6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE; Molecular Probes) in phosphate-buffered saline for 8 min at room temperature and stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3∊ (2C11, eBioscience) in the presence or absence of GlcNAc and/or swainsonine (SW) (Sigma). Jurkat T cells were cultured in either glutamine-free RPMI 1640, 10% fetal bovine serum, 10/20 mm glucose, or glucose/glutamine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's base medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1.5 mm glucose. The indicated monosaccharides and/or metabolites were added daily except glucose, which was added only at time 0 and were titrated until a plateau was reached in l-PHA staining or toxicity was observed. The plateau or highest non-toxic dose is shown. TCR Signaling—1 × 106 purified splenic CD3+ T cells from Mgat5+/+, Mgat5+/-, and Mgat5-/- mice or from purified T cell cultures incubated in the presence or absence of GlcNAc (80 mm) and/or swainsonine (0.25 μm) for 72 h were mixed with 5 × 106 polystyrene beads (6 μm, Polysciences) coated at 4 °C overnight with 0.5 μg/ml anti-CD3∊ antibody (2C11, eBioscience) and pelleted at 5000 rpm for 15 s, incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times, and then solubilized with ice-cold 50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 300 mm NaCl, 1.0% Triton X-100, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and 2 mm orthovanadate for 20 min. Cell lysates were separated on Nupage 10% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen) under reducing conditions, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and immunoblotted with rabbit anti-phospho-Zap70 antibody (Ab; Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-phospho-LAT Ab (Upstate), and/or anti-actin Ab (Santa Cruz). MS/MS Mass Spectroscopy—For MS/MS mass spectroscopy to determine sugar nucleotide levels, Jurkat T cell pellets (20 × 106 cells) were resuspended in 300 ml of cold methanol:water (1:1) solution containing maltose as an internal standard, vortexed for 10 s, and then pipetted into tubes containing 600 ml of chloroform:methanol (3:2). Maltose (100 pmol) was added to each sample as an internal standard. Samples were vortexed for 1 min and then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were collected, and an equal volume of chloroform: methanol (1:1) was added followed by a second extraction. The pooled aqueous fraction containing the hydrophilic metabolite was dried with a SpeedVac, passed over C18 SepPak in water, dried, and stored at -80 °C. Before injection, the samples were dissolved in 100 ml of methanol:water (1:1). The samples were injected at 150 ml/h and analyzed on a 4000QTRAP (Mass Spectrometer (SCIEX). The metabolites were identified by their transitions in MS/MS and quantified using the Analyst Software (Applied Biosystems-SCIEX), which measured the area under the curve for major fragment ion (M2) corresponding to each parent ion (M1). Collision energy, declustering potential, and ion spray voltage were optimized for each metabolite. UDP-GlcNAc (M1 = 605.9 and M2 = 385.0 with setting declustering potential -40, collision energy -38, and ion spray voltage -3500) and UDP-Gal (M1 = 564.9 and M2 = 323.0 with setting declustering potential +80, collision energy +23, ion spray voltage +5500) were measured in negative and positive, respectively. Maltose was measured in negative mode (M1 = 341 and M2 = 161 with setting declustering potential -40, collision energy -13, and ion spray voltage -4000). Standards for maltose, UDP-GlcNAc, and UDP-Gal showed sensitivity to 15 pmol and linearity to 10 nmol. Data are reported as UDP-HexNAc and UDP-Hex due to potential interconversion of UDP-GlcNAc to UDP-GalNAc and UDP-Gal to UDP-Glc by 4′-epimerase activity, sugar nucleotides not distinguished in M1. In Vivo GlcNAc Treatment—GlcNAc was administered orally in age- and sex-matched PL/J littermate mice by adding GlcNAc to their drinking water at various concentrations. Fresh GlcNAc was given daily for 5 days, with the amount consumed approximated by determining the volume remaining after 24 h. After 5 days of treatment, harvested splenocytes were stained and analyzed by FACS. Cytokine ELISA—Supernatant from splenocyte and/or T cell cultures stimulated with myelin basic protein (MBP) and/or anti-CD3∊ (2C11, eBioscience) in the presence or absence of GlcNAc and/or SW were tested for IFN-γ, IL-6, and/or IL-4 levels by ELISA. Microtiter plates were coated with 50 μl of anti-IFN-γ (1 μg/ml, clone AN-18; eBioscience), anti-IL-6 (1.5 μg/ml, clone MP5-20F3; eBioscience), or anti-IL-4 (2 μg/ml, clone 11B11; eBioscience) overnight at 4 °C. Supernatants were applied at 50 μl/well and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Captured cytokines were detected using biotinylated anti-IFN-γ (1 μg/ml, clone R4-6A2; eBioscience), anti-IL-6 (1 μg/ml, clone MP5-32C11; eBioscience), or anti-IL-4 (1 μg/ml, clone BVD6-24G2; eBioscience) and detected using avidin horseradish peroxidase (eBioscience) at 1:500× dilution and o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride tablets (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Recombinant IFN-γ, IL-6, or IL-4 (eBioscience) was used as a standard. Adoptive Transfer EAE and NOD Diabetes—Adoptive transfer EAE was induced by subcutaneous immunization of wild-type PL/J mice with 100 μg of bovine MBP (Sigma) emulsified in Complete Freund's Adjuvant containing 4 mg/ml heat-inactivated Mycobacterium tuberculosis (H37 RA; Difco) distributed over three spots on the hind flank. Splenocytes were harvested after 11 days and stimulated in vitro with 50 μg/ml MBP in the presence or absence of 40 mm Glc-NAc (Sigma) added daily. After 96 h of incubation, CD3+ T cells were purified by negative selection (R&D Systems) and injected intraperitoneally into naïve PL/J Mgat5+/- recipient mice. Trypan blue exclusion determined <5% dead cells under both culture conditions. Mice were scored daily for clinical signs of EAE over the next 30 days with the observer blinded to treatment conditions. Mice were examined daily for clinical signs of EAE and scored in a blinded fashion as follows: 0, no disease; 1, loss of tail tone; 2, hindlimb weakness; 3, hindlimb paralysis; 4, forelimb weakness or paralysis and hindlimb paralysis; 5, moribund or dead. GlcNAc was administered orally to female NOD mice by adding fresh GlcNAc at a concentration of 250 μg/ml to the drinking water every 3 days. Spontaneous diabetes in wild-type NOD mice was diagnosed after two consecutive positive tests for glycosuria of ≥2000 mg/dl by Chemstrip (Accu-chek, Roche Applied Science) 1 week apart. T Cell Thresholds and Fractional Changes in β1,6GlcNAc Branching—Conditional or metabolic regulation of T cell activation thresholds could be expected to be sensitive to small incremental changes in N-glycan branching. To test this hypothesis we compared the agonist sensitivity of primary T cells from Mgat5+/+, Mgat5+/-, and Mgat5-/- mice. Mgat5+/- T cells show an ∼20-25% reduction in β1,6GlcNAc-branched N-glycans relative to Mgat5+/+ cells as indicated by l-PHA binding, a plant lectin specific for these structures (Fig. 2A) (15Demetriou M. Granovsky M. Quaggin S. Dennis J.W. Nature. 2001; 409: 733-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar, 23Morgan R. Gao G. Pawling J. Dennis J.W. Demetriou M. Li B. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 7200-7208Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Stimulation of purified CD3+ T cells with anti-CD3-coated microbeads demonstrates that Mgat5+/- cells are intermediate compared with Mgat5+/+ and Mgat5-/- cells for TCR signaling as shown by enhanced phosphorylation of Zap-70 and LAT (Fig. 2B). Mgat5+/- T cells are similarly intermediate for TCR-mediated proliferation, as shown by tracking cell division with CFSE (Fig. 2C). To confirm that small reductions in β1,6GlcNAc-branched N-glycans enhance TCR sensitivity, we treated wild type cells with minimal concentrations of SW. SW is a specific inhibitor of mannosidase II that blocks GlcNAc branching in N-glycans and is known to enhance T cell proliferation and TH1 differentiation (23Morgan R. Gao G. Pawling J. Dennis J.W. Demetriou M. Li B. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 7200-7208Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 25Wall K.A. Pierce J.D. Elbein A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5644-5648Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). At low levels of anti-CD3 stimulation, partial reductions in β1,6GlcNAc-branched N-glycans by low doses of swainsonine significantly enhance wild type T cell proliferation (Fig. 2D) (25Wall K.A. Pierce J.D. Elbein A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5644-5648Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 26Tulsiani D.R. Harris T.M. Touster O. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7936-7939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, changes in T cell activation thresholds can be readily detected with as little as ∼20-25% variations in β1,6GlcNAc-branched N-glycans. Metabolic Flux through the Hexosamine Pathway Regulates β1,6GlcNAc-branched N-Glycans in T Cells—The expression of tri (i.e. β1,4)- and tetra (i.e. β1,6)-antennary GlcNAc-branched N-glycans in cultured cells is sensitive to changes in the intracellular concentration of UDP-GlcNAc (14Sasai K.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 49-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The addition of GlcNAc to cultured cells supplements UDP-GlcNAc pools after uptake by bulk endocytosis, 6-phosphorylation, and conversion to UDP-GlcNAc (Fig. 1) (14Sasai K. Ikeda Y. Fujii T. Tsuda T. Taniguchi N. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 22Lau K.S. Partridge E.A. Grigorian A. Silvescu C.I. Reinhold V.N. Demetriou M. Dennis J.W.

Glucose, glutamine, acetyl-CoA, and UTP are metabolites required by the hexosamine pathway for de novo UDP-GlcNAc biosynthesis (Fig. 1). TCR activation of mouse T cells increases Mgat5 gene expression (15Demetriou M. Granovsky M. Quaggin S. Dennis J.W. Nature. 2001; 409: 733-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar), glucose uptake (28Frauwirth K.A. Thompson C.B. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 4661-4665Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), UDP-HexNAc levels (22Lau K.S. Partridge E.A. Grigorian A. Silvescu C.I. Reinhold V.N. Demetriou M. Dennis J.W. Cell. 2007; 129: 123-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar), and β1,6GlcNAc-branched N-glycans (23Morgan R. Gao G. Pawling J. Dennis J.W. Demetriou M. Li B. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 7200-7208Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). GlcNAc supplementation of activated T cells further enhances UDP-HexNAc levels, increasing the UDP-HexNAc:UDP-Hex ratio up to ∼6-fold (22Lau K.S. Partridge E.A. Grigorian A. Silvescu C.I. Reinhold V.N. Demetriou M. Dennis J.W. Cell. 2007; 129: 123-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). To determine whether hexosamine metabolite supplementation enhances expression of cell surface galectin ligands (i.e. N-glycan GlcNAc branching and poly-N-acetyllactosamine) in resting T cells, cells were titrated with various metabolites until a plateau was reached in l-PHA staining or toxicity was observed. Surface levels of β1,6GlcNAc-branched N-glycans (i.e. l-PHA staining) and poly-N-acetyllactosamine (indicated by staining with the plant lectin L. esculentum agglutinin) on non-TCR activated human Jurkat T cells were increased by supplementing the hexosamine pathway with high glucose, GlcNAc, acetoacetate, glutamine, ammonia, or uridine but not with control metabolites mannosamine, galactose, mannose, succinate, or pyruvate (Fig. 3, A and B; supplemental Fig. 1, A and B). Supplementing resting mouse ex vivo splenocytes with GlcNAc, glucose, or uridine in vitro significantly raised β1,6GlcNAc-branched N-glycans in CD4+ T cells (Fig. 4A). In non-T cells, GlcNAc supplementation also increases tri-antennary structures (22Lau K.S. Partridge E.A. Grigorian A. Silvescu C.I. Reinhold V.N. Demetriou M. Dennis J.W. Cell. 2007; 129: 123-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar), and these are likely also enhanced in supplemented T cells. MS/MS mass spectroscopy confirmed that Glc-NAc, glucose, and uridine supplements raised intracellular UDP-HexNAc levels in non-TCR-activated Jurkat T cells (Fig. 3C). On a per cell basis, UDP-HexNAc levels in Jurkat T cells appear lower than that reported for Chinese hamster ovary cells (29Tomiya N. Ailor E. Lawrence S.M. Betenbaugh M.J. Lee Y.C. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 293: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar); however, T cells are smaller and have a markedly higher nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio, making direct comparisons difficult. Co-supplementation of GlcNAc and uridine in resting Jurkat and wild type mouse T cells were additive and more effective than doubling the GlcNAc concentration (Figs. 3D and 4B). Supplementing the drinking water of Mgat5+/- or Mgat5+/+ mice with GlcNAc increased β1,6GlcNAc-branched N-glycans up to ∼40% on CD4+ T cells in vivo (Fig. 4C; supplemental Fig. 2A). Taken together, these data indicate that production of high affinity galectin ligands (e.g. β1,6GlcNAc-branched N-glycans and poly-N-acetyllactosamine) are limited in T cells by the availability of key intermediates of glucose, lipid, nitrogen, and nucleotide metabolism.FIGURE 4Metabolite supply to the hexosamine pathway regulates β1,6GlcNAc-branched N-glycan expression in resting primary mouse T cells. A and B, the indicated monosaccharides and metabolites were cultured with unstimulated mouse splenocytes for 3 days, stained with l-PHA-FITC in triplicate, and analyzed by FACS. The results are representative of at least three independent experiments. Error bars are present in all panels and represent the means ± S.E. of triplicate samples. C, splenocytes from Mgat5+/- mice orally supplemented with GlcNAc for 5 days via their drinking water at the indicated concentrations were stained with l-PHA-FITC in triplicate and analyzed by FACS. On average, mice drank ∼4.6 ± 0.25 ml/day, estimated by determining the amount of GlcNAc solution remaining daily. For a 28.5-g mouse, the approximate mg/kg doses received is 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160.

https://openalex.org/W2146995322,"Cancer is recognized to be a family of gene-based diseases whose causes are to be found in disruptions of basic biologic processes. An increasingly deep catalogue of canonical networks details the specific molecular interaction of genes and their products. However, mapping of disease phenotypes to alterations of these networks of interactions is accomplished indirectly and non-systematically. Here we objectively identify pathways associated with malignancy, staging, and outcome in cancer through application of an analytic approach that systematically evaluates differences in the activity and consistency of interactions within canonical biologic processes. Using large collections of publicly accessible genome-wide gene expression, we identify small, common sets of pathways - Trka Receptor, Apoptosis response to DNA Damage, Ceramide, Telomerase, CD40L and Calcineurin - whose differences robustly distinguish diverse tumor types from corresponding normal samples, predict tumor grade, and distinguish phenotypes such as estrogen receptor status and p53 mutation state. Pathways identified through this analysis perform as well or better than phenotypes used in the original studies in predicting cancer outcome. This approach provides a means to use genome-wide characterizations to map key biological processes to important clinical features in disease."
https://openalex.org/W2016224955,"Mammalian nutrient sensors are novel targets for therapeutic intervention in disease states such as insulin resistance and muscle wasting; however, the proteins responsible for this important task are largely uncharacterized. To address this issue we have dissected an amino acid (AA) sensor/effector regulon that controls the expression of the System A amino acid transporter SNAT2 in mammalian cells, a paradigm nutrient-responsive process, and found evidence for the convergence of at least two sensor/effector pathways. During AA withdrawal, JNK is activated and induces the expression of SNAT2 in L6 myotubes by stimulating an intronic nutrient-sensitive domain. A sensor for large neutral AA (e.g. Tyr, Gln) inhibits JNK activation and SNAT2 up-regulation. Additionally, shRNA and transporter chimeras demonstrate that SNAT2 provides a repressive signal for gene transcription during AA sufficiency, thus echoing AA sensing by transceptor (transporter-receptor) orthologues in yeast (Gap1/Ssy1) and Drosophila (PATH).

The nutrient sensors that influence these processes are poorly defined in higher eukaryotes, so, in an attempt to clarify AA sensing in mammalian cells, the molecular regulation of a paradigm AA-sensitive process (the System A amino acid transporter) has been investigated. Sodium-dependent neutral amino acid transporter 2 (SNAT2, encoded by the gene SLC38A2) exhibits functional and regulatory properties of the classically defined System A transporter (4Mackenzie B. Erickson J.D. Pflugers Arch. 2004; 447: 784-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Hence, stimulation of System A by AA deprivation (aka adaptive regulation) or insulin occurs concurrent with increased SNAT2 expression (5Hyde R. Christie G.R. Litherland G.J. Hajduch E. Taylor P.M.

System A substrates, including the synthetic AA analogue α-methylaminoisobutyric acid (Me-AIB), suppress the increase in SNAT2 expression that occurs in AA-starved cells (9Lopez-Fontanals M. Rodriguez-Mulero S. Casado F.J. Derijard B. Pastor-Anglada M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 122: 5-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 10Ling R. Bridges C.C. Sugawara M. Fujita T. Leibach F.H.

Hence, the concept that SNAT2 activity may regulate transporter expression has been developed and both direct and indirect mechanisms of transport-dependent sensing have been proposed (1Hyde R. Taylor P.M. Hundal H.S. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). SNAT2 may function as a hybrid transporter-receptor (transceptor) whereby structural changes during the transport cycle may be transduced to signaling pathways; such AA transceptors are well documented in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (12Donaton M.C.

However, this transceptor model cannot completely account for the control of System A/SNAT2, because AAs that are not substrates for this transporter (Trp, Tyr, Phe) also repress System A (14Heaton J.H. Gelehrter T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2900-2907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here, AA deprivation is shown to stimulate functional expression of SNAT2 in rat L6 myotubes and HeLa cells through transcriptional induction and protein stabilization. The AA-dependent control of the latter process is conferred by a region in the N terminus of SNAT2. Inhibitors of JNK impair adaptive regulation and the AAs shown to regulate SNAT2 expression are either capable of restraining JNK phosphorylation and/or interacting with SNAT2. By using a shRNA approach it is demonstrated that SNAT2 functions as a mammalian AA transceptor, which acts in an autoregulatory gene expression pathway.

Taylor P.M. Hundal H.S. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) for 1 h, rinsed, and incubated in the appropriate buffer for cell stimulation. Monolayers were rinsed prior to lysis or cell membrane isolation (17Hajduch E. Alessi D.R. Hemmings B.A. Hundal H.S. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1006-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). L6/HeLa cells transfected with pC3luc constructs were incubated in growth medium supplemented with 0.8 mg/ml G418 (Melford, Suffolk, UK). HEK 293 and HeLa cells were transiently transfected with pCDNA6 or psiStrike constructs (10 μg DNA/10-cm plate) using calcium phosphate. Solute Transport—Transport measurements were performed as previously described (17Hajduch E. Alessi D.R. Hemmings B.A. Hundal H.S. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1006-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), with slight alterations. Following cellular stimulations, L6 cells were rinsed with Hepes-buffered saline (HBS), exposed to uptake solutions (typically 10 μm [14C]Me-AIB (1 μCi/ml) in HBS) for 10 min at room temperature, then rinsed 3× with 0.9% NaCl (4 °C) and lysed in 50 mm NaOH. Nonspecific radiotracer binding was assessed with 10 mm unlabeled Me-AIB (or by brief tracer exposure in kinetics experiments). For cis-inhibition experiments, the uptake solution was supplemented with unlabeled AAs as noted. For trans-inhibition experiments (described under supplementary data), L6 myotubes were preincubated in AA-free EBSS for 4 h and then exposed to 2 mm unlabeled AA for 20 min (at 37 °C). Me-AIB uptake was subsequently measured as above. Uptake was standardized against protein recovery, or is presented relative to a control value. Immunoblotting—20-50 μg of cell protein was separated by SDS-PAGE as previously described (17Hajduch E. Alessi D.R. Hemmings B.A. Hundal H.S. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1006-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were probed with signaling antibodies (New England Biolabs, Hitchin, UK), monoclonal antibodies against the Na/K-ATPase α1 subunit (α6F; 1/8000; DSHB, University of Iowa), the V5 epitope (1/5000; Invitrogen) or chicken anti-SNAT2 IgY (1/200, ∼0.5 μg/ml; Antigen, FLLESNLGKYET). Luciferase Activity—Luciferase assay was performed in 20 μg of cell lysate using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Southampton, UK; according to the manufacturer's protocol) in a TD20/20 luminometer (Turner BioSystems, Sunnyvale, CA). Luciferase activity in experimental samples was standardized relative to serum-starved, AA-supplemented cells. Immunofluorescence—HEK 293 cells were grown on coverslips and transfected with pcDNA6-V5His-Version A (Empty Vector, Invitrogen), pcDNA6-LacZ-V5His or the pcDNA6-SNAT2-V5His construct. Cells were rinsed with PBS and fixed with paraformaldehyde (4%, w/v) in PBS for 30 min. Cells were rinsed twice with PBS and rehydrated in PBS/2% fish skin gelatin (w/v) for 30 min. Cells were then incubated in PBS in the presence or absence of 0.2% Triton X-100 for 2 min. Detergent was removed with four changes of PBS. Coverslips were incubated overnight with anti-V5 monoclonal antibodies (1/250, v/v) in PBS/2% fish skin gelatin, were subsequently rinsed with PBS, and were incubated with fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse antibody in PBS/gelatin. The rinsed and mounted coverslips were visualized by fluorescence microscopy. Statistical Analysis—One-way analysis of variance and non-linear regression were performed using GraphPad Prism 4 software and considered statistically significant at p < 0.05. For the non-linear regression analyses in Fig. 6, Equations 1 (inhibition) and 2 (repression) were used, y=ymax-((ymax·x)/(Kd+x)) y=ymax-((x·(ymax-ymin))/(Kd+x)) where the parameters ymax, ymin, and Kd are derived from the best-fit curve to the experimental data (y being transport rate/relative luciferase activity and x being inhibitor/repressor concentration) using GraphPad Prism 4. Online Supplemental Material—Supplementary methods containing extended protocols (cloning, transfection, buffers, IgY generation, and purification) and additional data showing: (i) the time-dependent increase in System A activity during AA deprivation; (ii) the repression of System A activity by individual AAs; (iii) an alignment of the N termini of vertebrate SNAT2 orthologues; (iv) the lack of effect of CaR modulators on adaptive regulation of System A; (v) the effect of altered extracellular pH on System A transport and adaptive regulation; and (vi) a comparison of the ability of individual AAs to cis-inhibit and trans-inhibit System A are available online. Amino Acid Specificity of System A Regulation—AA starvation of L6 myotubes induces a time-dependent increase in System A activity ((5Hyde R. Christie G.R. Litherland G.J. Hajduch E. Taylor P.M. Hundal H.S. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), Fig. 1A, and supplemental Fig. S1) through a process dependent upon new protein synthesis (net induction in nutrient-deprived cells: 92.8 ± 32.3 pmol/min/mg; net induction in the presence of the translation inhibitor cycloheximide: 16.1 ± 3.8 pmol/min/mg; p < 0.05). The AAs that regulate System A activity were determined by providing individual AAs (at 2 mm) to otherwise AA-starved myotubes (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S2). Consistent with the idea that the System A transporter might generate a repressive signal during the transport cycle, AAs shown to be the best substrates for SNAT2 (18Reimer R.J. Chaudhry F.A. Gray A.T. Edwards R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7715-7720Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) were generally the compounds with the greatest repressive effect, although aromatic AAs were also found to significantly repress System A induction (p < 0.05). Cis-inhibition experiments were used to demonstrate that although 2 mm Tyr impaired System A up-regulation, Tyr did not significantly interact with System A at this concentration (Fig. 1B). Nevertheless, (l)-Gln, Ala, and Me-AIB all interact with SNAT2 and the non-repressive AAs did not (Fig. 1B). SNAT2 abundance increases in AA-deprived L6 myotubes (5Hyde R. Christie G.R. Litherland G.J. Hajduch E. Taylor P.M. Hundal H.S. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Hence, the effects of the above AAs on SNAT2 protein expression were assessed using chicken anti-SNAT2 antibodies (Fig. 1C). These antibodies were designed against a region in the cytoplasmic N-terminal domain of SNAT2 (FLLESNLGKYET) and bind to two broad bands (≈35 kDa and 55 kDa) that increase in response to AA deprivation. Given the co-regulation of these proteins we propose that the higher band is full-length SNAT2, and the lower band is a cleaved form of SNAT2. A cross-reactive band (≈75 kDa) is also observed; however, this protein is restricted to intracellular membranes (data not shown). Tyr, Ala, and (l)-Gln prevented the induction of SNAT2 protein and Me-AIB had a slight repressive effect after 4 h (Fig. 1C), which was almost complete after 6 h of incubation with Me-AIB. Amino acids that were non-repressive following4hof stimulation (Leu, Tyr, Arg) remained non-repressive even when incubated with cells for 6 h. Because Me-AIB had a modest repressive effect on SNAT2 expression, but a large effect on System A transport, the overall repressive effect of Me-AIB on System A activity may largely be due to trans-inhibition of plasma membrane SNAT2 by cytoplasmic Me-AIB (19Bracy D.S. Handlogten M.E. Barber E.F. Han H.P. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1514-1520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether Me-AIB exerted a repressive effect strictly on SNAT2 gene expression, analysis of the SNAT2/SLC38A2 promoter was performed. Amino Acids Control SNAT2 Transcription and Protein Stability—The SLC38A2 AA responsive domain isolated by Palii et al. contains three elements, a CAAT-box, an amino acid response element (AARE in Fig. 1D) and a purine-rich element (PuR in Fig. 1D), each of which contribute to SNAT2 expression during AA limitation (7Palii S.S. Chen H. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3463-3471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The rat SNAT2 promoter was cloned and two versions of this promoter, one (-1 + 1) containing the first intron of the gene and one (-1 + 0.3), which lacks the first intron and its associated nutrient responsive domain, were placed upstream of firefly luciferase (Fig. 1D). SNAT2-luciferase vectors were stably expressed in L6 cells. The inclusion of 1 kb of upstream sequence in both SNAT2-luciferase promoters produced a substantial basal level of transcription relative to CMV minimal promoter (Fig. 1D), as also seen with upstream regions of the mouse SNAT2 promoter (7Palii S.S. Chen H. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3463-3471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The SNAT2-1+1-luciferase transgene was significantly induced following7hofAA deprivation (Fig. 1D). SNAT2-luciferase induction was dependent upon the presence of intron 1, because SNAT2-1+0.3-luciferase activity was not stimulated by AA deprivation. The relative activation produced by the nutrient responsive domain of rat SNAT2 intron 1 in the absence or presence of AA is around 2.2 (Fig. 1D), which, given the short duration of AA starvation we used (7 h versus 10 or 12 h in other studies), is comparable to results reported elsewhere (∼1.8-2.5 for mouse SNAT2 intron 1 (7Palii S.S. Chen H. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3463-3471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar); ∼3 for human SNAT2 intron 1, (20Gaccioli F. Huang C.C. Wang C. Bevilacqua E. Franchi-Gazzola R. Gazzola G.C. Bussolati O. Snider M.D. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17929-17940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). As a further negative control, a luciferase construct driven by the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter was also unaffected by nutrient availability. In the presence of the repressive AAs ((l)-Gln, Ala, Tyr, Me-AIB; 2 mm), SNAT2-1+1-luciferase activity was reduced to control (AA+) levels, whereas Arg, a non-repressive AA, did not affect expression of this construct. Given that nutrient-responsive transcriptional controls appear to impart only a modest stimulus for SNAT2 induction, we examined the possibility that additional levels of control contributed to transporter activation. Hatzoglou's group (20Gaccioli F. Huang C.C. Wang C. Bevilacqua E. Franchi-Gazzola R. Gazzola G.C. Bussolati O. Snider M.D. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17929-17940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) has recently found an internal ribosome entry sequence (IRES) in the 5′-untranslated region (UTR) of the SLC38A2 gene; however, unlike in certain other transcripts where an IRES has been documented (e.g. CAT1 (21Fernandez J. Yaman I. Sarnow P. Snider M.D. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19198-19205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar)), the SNAT2 IRES does not stimulate translation but permits uninterrupted transporter expression during nutrient stress, a condition where global translation initiation may be restricted. We proposed that SNAT2 protein may be stabilized during nutrient stress and to test this we expressed a CMV-driven SNAT2 construct (containing a C-terminal V5-His6 epitope tag) in HeLa cells, since these are more readily transfected than L6 cells and in separate experiments (not shown) were found to also exhibit System A adaptation in a JNK-dependent manner. V5 immunoreactivity was observed in lysates of SNAT2V5-transfected HeLa cells with a banding pattern appropriate for the full-length SNAT2 glycoprotein (55-60 kDa). The SNAT2V5 signal was absent from cells which had been cotransfected with anti-SNAT2 shRNAs (but not from cells transfected with scrambled shRNA controls), thus validating that the protein bands observed are a specific consequence of SNAT2V5 expression. AA deprivation of the SNAT2V5-transfected HeLa cells for 8 h led to a marked increase in V5 immunoreactivity, implying an increased abundance of SNAT2V5 protein in these cells (Fig. 2A). Our studies in L6 cells had shown that the CMV promoter used here was not sensitive to AA-deprivation (Fig. 1D) and to verify the specificity of this AA-dependent increase in SNAT2V5 protein, rat SNAT5 (a structurally related transporter from the SLC38 gene family) was V5-tagged and expressed in HeLa cells. Although analogous to the SNAT2V5 construct, an equivalent induction of SNAT5V5 under nutrient deprivation was not observed (Fig. 2A). Additionally, given that the two constructs were expressed from an identical transcriptional promoter (CMV), SNAT5V5 appears to be considerably more stable than SNAT2V5 in HeLa cells. Our interpretation of these data is that during AA-sufficiency SNAT2 protein is considerably less stable than during AA-restriction. A corollary of the proposal that SNAT2 is stabilized during nutrient deprivation is that a particular region of the SNAT2 sequence may confer AA-regulated stability effects. It should therefore be possible to identify such regions through mutagenesis. The cytoplasmic domains of SNAT2 are the best candidate regions for associating with the proteolytic machinery; however, the structure of SNAT2 within the cell membrane is poorly characterized. Two topologies have been proposed which differ in the number of transmembrane domains (15Yao D. Mackenzie B. Ming H. Varoqui H. Zhu H. Hediger M.A. Erickson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22790-22797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 18Reimer R.J. Chaudhry F.A. Gray A.T. Edwards R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 16473-16477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), as illustrated in Fig. 2B. Both models predict a large intracellular N terminus, but the 12-pass model proposed by Sugawara et al. (22Sugawara M. Nakanishi T. Fei Y.J. Huang W. Ganapathy M.E. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16473-16477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) differs from the 11-pass model of Yao et al. (15Yao D. Mackenzie B. Ming H. Varoqui H. Zhu H. Hediger M.A. Erickson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22790-22797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and Reimer et al. (18Reimer R.J. Chaudhry F.A. Gray A.T. Edwards R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7715-7720Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) in placing the C terminus at an intracellular location. To help distinguish between the two models, SNAT2V5 was expressed in HEK 293 cells and the cells were subject to analysis by immunofluorescence (Fig. 2C). Unlike the cytoplasmically localized LacZV5 control, HEK293 cells transfected with SNAT2V5 did not require permeabilization with Triton X-100 to allow an appreciable signal to be observed in anti-V5 immunofluorescence. Hence, in SNAT2V5, the C-terminal V5 epitope is accessible from the extracellular domain, supporting the 11-pass topology of SNAT2. Sequence identity between SNAT proteins is highest within the transmembrane domains and lowest within the hydrophilic N terminus (see supplemental Fig. S3) and the large extracellular loop and consequently it is predicted that isoform-specific regulatory domains are present within the hydrophilic regions. To test whether the N terminus of SNAT2 might control AA-dependent stability, a CMV-driven chimera was generated between SNAT2 and SNAT5V5 using a conserved NcoI site that maps to the first extracellular loop of the two proteins (as illustrated, Fig. 2B). Only 3 nucleotides from the SNAT2 5′-UTR were present in this construct (to minimize the potential influence of the 5′-UTR in AA-dependent control). Upon transfection of HeLa cells, SNAT2-5V5 protein expression was comparable to that of SNAT2V5 and was increased upon AA deprivation (Fig. 2A). Hence, by grafting the SNAT2 N terminus onto SNAT5 we have rendered the stability of the SNAT5 protein sensitive to AA availability. Signaling Pathways Mediating System A Adaptation—AA availability controls a variety of signaling pathways. To identify those pathways relevant to System A regulation, L6 myotubes were incubated with signal transduction inhibitors during our adaptation protocol prior to measuring Me-AIB transport (Fig. 3A). Inhibitors of the ERK pathway (PD-098059, 50 μm), the p38 MAPK pathway (SB-203580, 10 μm), or mTOR (rapamycin, 100 nm), neither mimicked (data not shown) nor impaired System A adaptation. In contrast, inhibitors of PI3K (wortmannin, 100 nm, and LY-294002, 50 μm) and JNK (SP-600125, 30 μm) significantly inhibited System A adaptation. 3-methyladenine (10 mm) inhibits class III PI3K isoforms (23Blommaart E.F. Krause U. Schellens J.P. Vreeling-Sindelarova H. Meijer A.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar) and has been shown to inhibit autophagic proteolysis in AA-starved mammalian cells. This compound did not affect System A adaptation, which argues against a role for class III PI3K in the nutritional regulation of System A. AA withdrawal is shown to increase the phosphorylation (activation) of both ERK and JNK in L6 cells (Fig. 3B). Compared with previous studies (8Franchi-Gazzola R. Visigalli R. Bussolati O.

Pastor-Anglada M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 122: 5-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), wherein JNK and ERK signaling peaks within 30 min, MAPK activation was both delayed and prolonged in L6 cells, being apparent between 2 and 6 h of nutrient restriction. During AA deprivation, SEK1 (a MAPK kinase lying directly upstream of JNK) was rapidly phosphorylated, whereas the mTOR target p70-S6 kinase (S6K) was dephosphorylated and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (a downstream effector of class I PI3K signaling) was unaffected. The protein kinase GCN2 has been shown to phosphorylate the translation factor eIF2α during amino acid restriction (24Jousse C. Averous J. Bruhat A. Carraro V. Mordier S. Fafournoux P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 313: 447-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar); however, although eIF2α phosphorylation increased with prolonged incubation time, AA withdrawal did not affect this in L6 myotubes. Tunicamycin, which affects eIF2α independently of GCN2, did stimulate eIF2α phosphorylation in L6 myotubes (21Fernandez J. Yaman I. Sarnow P. Snider M.D. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19198-19205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Ligand Sensitivity of JNK Signaling—If a single AA sensor was responsible for restraining SNAT2 adaptation, then that same sensor should also restrain signaling through the pathways that induce SNAT2 expression. Data from ourselves (this report) and others (9Lopez-Fontanals M. Rodriguez-Mulero S. Casado F.J. Derijard B. Pastor-Anglada M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 122: 5-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) implicate JNK in this process. However, relative to the GCN2 and mTOR pathways, AA signaling via JNK is poorly documented. To address this, we assessed the ability of specific AAs to inhibit the JNK activation typically observed in AA-starved cells (Fig. 4). Of the AAs tested, (l)-Gln and Tyr (2 mm) substantially reduced JNK phosphorylation, while Ala (also Ser and Trp) had more modest"

In this study, we performed statistical analysis of the frequency of occurrence of aromatic pairs in a bacterial TM data base that provided an initial indication that the appearance of a specific aromatic pattern, Aromatic-XX-Aromatic, is not coincidental, similar to the well characterized QXXS motif. The QXXS motif was previously shown to be both critical and sufficient for stabilizing TM self-assembly. Using the ToxR system, we monitored the dimerization propensities of TM domains that contain mutations of interacting residues to aromatic amino acids and demonstrated that aromatic residues can adequately stabilize self-association. Importantly, we have provided an example of a natural TM domain, the cholera toxin secretion protein EpsM, whose TM self-assembly is mediated by an aromatic motif (WXXW). This is, in fact, the first evidence that aromatic residues are involved in the dimerization of a wild type TM domain.

In contrast to the soluble regions of membrane proteins, our knowledge of the factors that control protein-protein interactions and recognition of the membrane-embedded domains is still limited.

However, the involvement of additional motifs or key factors that may mediate protein-protein interactions within the membrane merit further investigation.

Even a single mutation of aromatic amino acid in the sequence of the short amyloid peptide abolishes the ability of the peptide to form amyloid fibrils (17Azriel R. Gazit E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34156-34161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of membrane immunoglobulin and the T-cell receptor reveals highly conserved aromatic amino acids within the TM domains of these proteins, which may indicate the involvement of these residues in TM-TM interactions (24Campbell K.S. Backstrom B.T. Tiefenthaler G. Palmer E. Semin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 393-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). An additional piece of evidence that supports this assumption is the recent finding of Langosch and co-workers (25Ridder A. Skupjen P. Unterreitmeier S. Langosch D. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 894-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) that demonstrated, using a randomized TM library, tryptophan is enriched in self-interacting TM domains containing a heptad repeat backbone sequence. In this study, we have investigated the role of aromatic residues in TM self-assembly. We performed a statistical analysis that revealed that an Aromatic-XX-Aromatic pattern (which was chosen based on the QXXS motif) is over-represented in a bacterial TM data base. Using the ToxR system, we measured the ability of aromatic residues to stabilize oligomerization when inserted into the well defined interaction interface of the N-terminal TM domain of the Escherichia coli aspartate receptor (Tar-1). This TM domain, which is part of the bacterial chemotaxis receptor, was previously shown to form a homodimer through its two polar residues (22QXXS25) by forming hydrogen bonds (14Sal-Man N. Gerber D. Shai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27449-27457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that aromatic residues can enable self-assembly when located at the positions of the polar QXXS motif. Importantly, we have demonstrated that the EpsM TM sequence, which had been found in the statistical analysis search to contain a native double aromatic sequence (WXXW), was substantially affected in terms of dimerization by mutations in these specific positions. This protein was chosen because it was previously suggested to form dimers (26Abendroth J. Rice A.E. McLuskey K. Bagdasarian M. Hol W.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 585-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), data that are not available for most membrane proteins. Statistical Analysis—The analysis of the frequencies of occurrence of the QXXW, QXXY, QXXF, WXXS, YXXS, FXXS, WXXW, YXXY, and FXXF patterns were performed on a bacterial TM domain data base. The source of the TM sequences was the annotated non-redundant data base Swiss-Prot updated to February 2005. The data base contains 41,916 bacterial TM domains with lengths ranging between 15 and 30 amino acids. The occurrences of the different amino acid combinations in the data base were counted. The averaged expected frequency of occurrences was calculated by counting the number of specific pattern occurrences in 100 randomized data bases. Randomization of the data base was achieved by combining the sequences of the TM domain of a particular length into one long string of characters, which was then shuffled randomly and recut into the original length. Construction of the ToxR Chimeras—A NheI-BamHI TM-DNA cassette encoding 16 residues of the Tar-1 wild type (WT) TM domain (13MVLGVFALLQLISGSL28) or the EpsM WT TM domain (26MGALTVLAIAYWGIWQ41) were inserted between the ToxR transcription activator and the E. coli maltose binding protein MalE within the ToxR-MalE plasmid. The TM domain of interest was inserted into a 6-hydrophobic-amino-acid-sequence, thus creating a hydrophobic sequence of 22 residues, which is a typical length of TM domains. Point mutations of Tar-1 were done in the Gln and/or the Ser at positions 22 and 25, respectively. Point mutations of EpsM were done in one or both Trp residues at positions 37 and 40. The QXXS motif + backbone and WXXW motif + backbone constructs contain the 22QXXS25 or the 22WXXW25 motifs within a stretch of leucine and alanine, respectively (see Table 2). The WXXW + Ala16 construct contains the WXXW motif with the sequence of 16 alanines (see Table 2). The sequences of all of the constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The nomenclature of the TM domains represents the two amino acids occupying positions 22 and 25 of the Tar-1 TM domain or positions 37 and 40 of the EpsM TM domain.TABLE 2TM sequences of the EpsM wild type mutantsDesignation of TM domainMutationsSequenceaAmino acids are numbered according to their position in the WT protein (Swissprot Q9KNK8),bThe amino acids in the positions of the original dimerization motif are in bold,cMutations in the Tar-1 TM domain are underlined,dThe nomenclature of the TM domains represents the two amino acids at positions 37 and 40 of original polar residues motif, respectively,eThe TM domains were inserted into a 6-hydrophobic amino acid sequence, thus creating a hydrophobic sequence of 22 residues that is of typical length of TM domainsEpsM WT (WW)26MGALTVLAIAYWGIWQ41EpsM AWW37A26MGALTVLAIAYAGIWQ41EpsM WAW40A26MGALTVLAIAYWGIAQ41EpsM AAW37A W40A26MGALTVLAIAYAGIAQ41EpsM YWW37Y26MGALTVLAIAYYGIWQ41EpsM WYW40Y26MGALTVLAIAYWGIYQ41EpsM YYW37Y W40Y26MGALTVLAIAYYGIYQ41a Amino acids are numbered according to their position in the WT protein (Swissprot Q9KNK8)b The amino acids in the positions of the original dimerization motif are in boldc Mutations in the Tar-1 TM domain are underlinedd The nomenclature of the TM domains represents the two amino acids at positions 37 and 40 of original polar residues motif, respectivelye The TM domains were inserted into a 6-hydrophobic amino acid sequence, thus creating a hydrophobic sequence of 22 residues that is of typical length of TM domains Open table in a new tab In Vivo Detection of Homodimerization of TM Domains within the Membrane—The ToxR transcription activator can be used successfully to assess weak protein-protein interactions within the E. coli membrane. A Tar-1 TM domain encoding the DNA cassette was grafted between the ToxR transcription activator and the maltose binding protein in the ToxR-MalE plasmid. The plasmid was then transformed into E. coli FHK12 cells, which contain β-galactosidase, under the control of a ctx promoter. Dimerization of the TM domains in this system results in association of the ToxR transcription activator, which then becomes active and is able to bind the ctx promoter (27Langosch D. Brosig B. Kolmar H. Fritz H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Quantification of the level of homodimerization was done by measuring the activity of the β-galactosidase reporter gene and by normalizing it to the cell protein content (A590) (Miller units). The base-line activity of a negative control ToxR'Ala16, which remains a monomer, was subtracted from all of the results and referred to as 0% dimerization. The transformed cells were grown in the presence of chloramphenicol for 18 h at 37 °C. β-Galactosidase activities were quantified in crude cell lysates after adding o-nitrophenylgalactosidase and monitoring the reaction at 405 nm for 20 min at intervals of 30 s at 28 °C by a Molecular Devices kinetic reader (27Langosch D. Brosig B. Kolmar H. Fritz H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 28Kolmar H. Frisch C. Kleemann G. Gotze K. Stevens F.J. Fritz H.J. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 375: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Specific β-galactosidase activities were calculated from the Vmax of the reaction. ToxR-TM-MalE Chimera Protein Expression Levels—Western blot analyses were performed for any mutant tested. Aliquots of 10 μl of FHK12 cells, each with a different plasmid, were mixed with a sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and then transferred to the nitrocellulose membrane. The primary antibody used was anti-maltose binding protein. The detection was done with a Phototope-HRP Western blot detection system from Cell Signaling Technology. Maltose Complementation Assay—Membrane insertion and correct orientation were examined as previously described (29Brosig B. Langosch D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1052-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Briefly, PD28 cells transformed with the different plasmids were cultured overnight. The cells were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and used to inoculate M9 minimal medium, including 0.4% maltose at a 200-fold dilution. The growth of the cells was measured at different time points by a spectrophotometer at 650 nm. Molecular Models for the Tar-1 Dimers—Homodimerization was modeled for 16-mer segments derived from the Tar-1 TM sequence. Docking and simulation were carried out using the affinity module of the Accelrys Insight II package. The Tar-1 homodimers were designed as two canonical R-handed α-helices. The starting position for the docking protocol was alignment of the two TM segments in vacuum; one arbitrary monomer molecule was fixed, and the movement of the other monomer was confined within a 10-Å radius relative to the fixed monomer. The monomers were allowed to move and rotate freely in all three dimensions. Only structures that differed from each other by >1.5 Å root mean square deviation were accepted for further analysis (15,000 structures). Thus, we ensured optimal sampling of the conformational space needed for the formation of the lowest energy parallel dimer structure. The generated structures were then minimized for 100 steps. For each TM dimer, the 100 lowest energetic structures were subjected to a simulated annealing protocol from 500,000 to 300,000 in 50 steps (each step lasts 100 fs). This was followed by 1000 steps of energy minimization. The resulting structures were clustered according to their structural similarity. The energy of the dimer interaction and the hydrogen bonds were calculated for each structure with the Discover module. The energy calculations were done using the CFF91 force field with complete atomic details and with no distance cutoff. The structure with the minimal calculated energy from the lower energetic cluster was selected as the final structure of each TM sequence for further analysis. In this study, we have investigated the involvement of aromatic residues in TM self-assembly. To this end, we used the well characterized interaction interface of the dimer formed by the N-terminal TM domain of the E. coli aspartate receptor (QXXS). Here, we have examined whether replacement of one or both polar residues (which are localized to the interaction interface) by aromatic residues will support dimerization. Statistical Analysis—We analyzed the frequency of occurrence of aromatic residue pairs to determine whether these motifs may be involved in the association of actual TM domains. The pattern investigated, Aromatic-XX-Aromatic, was chosen based on the QXXS composition. A correlation between over- or under-representation of a specific pattern in TM domains and helix-helix interactions was previously found (30Senes A. Gerstein M. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 921-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). The analysis was done in a broad set of bacterial TM domains. Our results indicate that the aromatic pairs appear to be significantly over-represented compared with their theoretical expectancy. The WXXW pattern was found 419 times within a data base of 41,916 sequences of TM domains, whereas its average random expected occurrence was 303 ± 16 times (Fig. 1), and the YXXY pattern appeared 721 times, whereas its average random expected occurrence was 597 ± 22 times. The ratio of actual:expected occurrence of the WXXW and YXXY sequences is much higher than 1, whereas the ratio of QXXW and QXXY is significantly lower than 1 (Fig. 1B). On the other hand, the WXXS and YXXS motifs approach 1. Taken together, these results suggest that the WXXW, YXXY, QXXW, and QXXY patterns may function as self-association motifs. The frequencies of occurrence of the Phe motifs (FXXF, QXXF, or FXXS) were within the range of the random distribution. These results may indicate that Phe pairs do not serve as association motifs, probably because Phe is much more frequent in TM domains than Trp and Tyr. Trp and Tyr residues within TM domains are not equally distributed along the TM sequence and tend to be clustered at the lipid-water interface (31Tsang S. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Comput. Biol. 1996; 3: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Therefore, we statistically analyzed the frequency of occurrence of the aromatic patterns separately in the N-terminal, core, and C-terminal parts of the TM domains. The ratio of actual:expected occurrence of the WXXW sequence was 1.26, 1.88, and 1.47 for the N terminus, core, and C terminus, respectively. The ratios of the YXXY were 1.04, 1.41, and 1.18 and for the FXXF, 1.05, 1.12, and 1.02. These results are consistent with the data acquired from the full TM sequence and imply that the overrepresentation of the WXXW and YXXY motifs is not related to the tendency of W and Y residues to cluster close to the lipid-water interface. Homodimerization of Different Tar-1 Mutants Containing Aromatic Residues—To determine the ability of aromatic residues to mediate TM-TM interactions, we utilized the ToxR assembly system, which can detect self-association within the inner membrane of E. coli (27Langosch D. Brosig B. Kolmar H. Fritz H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The two wild type residues, located at the interaction interface of the Tar-1 dimer (at positions 22 and 25, corresponding to Gln and Ser, respectively), were replaced by Trp and were examined for their level of dimerization. Tar W/W, in which both positions 22 and 25 were replaced by Trp, preserved ∼75% of the dimerization activity of the WT Tar-1 construct (Fig. 2). Substitution of only one residue of the original motif for Trp yielded high activity for replacement of Ser (Tar Q/W ∼125% activity) and moderate activity for replacement of Gln (Tar W/S ∼50% activity). These results are expected, considering the different contribution of each residue of the original motif to the dimerization propensity of Tar-1 (∼70% was stabilized by Gln and only ∼30% by Ser (32Sal-Man N. Gerber D. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2309-2313Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar)). The localization of the Trp residues relative to the membrane can serve as an additional factor that affects the dimerization ability of the constructs and will be discussed later. Tar-1 G/S, I/S, and M/S mutants showed low dimerization propensities compared with Tar-1 W/S mutant, thus indicating that the association mediated by aromatic residues does not relate to their bulky nature. To exclude the possibility that the difference between the dimerization activities of the constructs resulted from different expression levels of the chimera proteins, or alternatively, from a failure of the constructs to properly insert into the membrane, we performed Western blotting and maltose complementation assays (Fig. 2, B and C, respectively). The expression levels of the chimera proteins were similar to the Tar-1 WT (Fig. 2B). Note that all activities were normalized to the protein expression level, using the Western blotting results. Correct integration of the ToxR-TM-MalE chimera proteins into the inner membrane of E. coli was assessed by examining the ability of the mutants to functionally complement a MalE-deficient E. coli strain (PD28) (29Brosig B. Langosch D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1052-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Because PD28 cells are unable to grow on minimal medium containing maltose as the only carbon source, only cells that express the chimera protein in the correct orientation (MalE pointing toward the periplasm) would be able to utilize maltose and thus allow cell growth. All constructs exhibited similar rates of cell growth, indicating proper membrane integration (Fig. 2C). A construct with a deleted TM domain (ΔTM) served as a negative control, because it was expected to reside in the cytoplasm and therefore was unable to complement the MalE deficiency. To determine whether this pattern of dimerization propensity is specific for Trp or represents a general trend among aromatic residues, we prepared six additional constructs that contain aromatic residue replacement at one or both positions of the polar dimerization motif (Table 1). The constructs exhibited an activity pattern similar to the Trp constructs (Fig. 3). Similar expression levels of the chimera proteins (Fig. 3, inset panels) and their correct integration were obtained (data not shown). Thus, we concluded that aromatic residues can facilitate and stabilize association within the membrane environment when localized to the oligomer interface, probably through stacking interactions.TABLE 1Different mutants of the Tar-1 TM domain used to determine the involvement of aromatic residues in TM assemblyDesignation of TM domainMutationsSequenceaAmino acids are numbered according to their position in the WT protein (Swissprot p07017),bThe amino acids in the positions of the original dimerization motif are in bold,cMutations in the Tar-1 TM domain are underlined,dThe nomenclature of the TM domains represents the two amino acids at positions 22 and 25 of original polar residues motif, respectively,eThe TM domains were inserted into a 6-hydrophobic amino acid sequence, thus creating a hydrophobic sequence of 22 residues that is of typical length of TM domainsTar-1 WT13MVLGVFALLQLISGSL28Tar-1 W/WQ22W S25W13MVLGVFALLWLIWGSL28Tar-1 Q/WS25W13MVLGVFALLQLIWGSL28Tar-1 W/SQ22W13MVLGVFALLWLISGSL28Tar-1 Y/YQ22Y S25Y13MVLGVFALLYLIYGSL28Tar-1 Q/YS25Y13MVLGVFALLQLIYGSL28Tar-1 Y/SQ22Y13MVLGVFALLYLISGSL28Tar-1 F/FQ22F S25F13MVLGVFALLFLIFGSL28Tar-1 Q/FS25F13MVLGVFALLQLIFGSL28Tar-1 F/SQ22F13MVLGVFALLFLISGSL28Tar-1 G/SQ22G13MVLGVFALLGLISGSL28Tar-1 M/SQ22M13MVLGVFALLMLISGSL28Tar-1 I/SQ22S13MVLGVFALLILISGSL28a Amino acids are numbered according to their position in the WT protein (Swissprot p07017)b The amino acids in the positions of the original dimerization motif are in boldc Mutations in the Tar-1 TM domain are underlinedd The nomenclature of the TM domains represents the two amino acids at positions 22 and 25 of original polar residues motif, respectivelye The TM domains were inserted into a 6-hydrophobic amino acid sequence, thus creating a hydrophobic sequence of 22 residues that is of typical length of TM domains Open table in a new tab Dimerization of the TM Domain of the Cholera Toxin Secretion Protein EpsM—To examine the involvement of aromatic motif in TM-TM interactions of an actual TM domain, we chose the cholera toxin secretion protein EpsM, which had been found to contain a WXXW sequence in the statistical analysis search. This protein contains a single TM domain and was previously suggested to form dimers (26Abendroth J. Rice A.E. McLuskey K. Bagdasarian M. Hol W.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 585-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) (such information is usually missing for many membrane proteins). The aromatic residues of the EpsM TM domain are conserved in related proteins of the bacterial secretion pathway (data not shown). This further suggests that these residues have a role in the function/structure of the protein. A sequence of 16 residues of the EpsM WT TM domain (26MGALTVLAIAYWGIWQ41) was inserted within the ToxR-MalE plasmid, and its dimerization propensity was measured. Replacement of the Trp residue by Ala at position 37 had only a small effect on the dimerization propensity (∼25% decrease, EpsM AW) and almost no effect on the dimerization for replacement at position 40 (EpsM WA). Replacement of both Trp residues by Ala, on the other hand, completely abolished dimerization (EpsM AA) (Fig. 4). These results suggest that the aromatic residues of the EpsM TM domain are critical for self-association. Nevertheless, the presence of a single aromatic residue is sufficient to preserve stable assembly. This is the first evidence that aromatic residues direct the dimerization of biological TM domains. Replacement of the Trp residues by a different aromatic residue, Tyr, had only a small effect on the association level, thus implying that the aromatic nature of the residues is the critical feature required for stable dimerization. Backbone-dependent Dimer Association of the WXXW Pattern—To determine whether an aromatic residue pair is sufficient for TM-TM dimerization, we examined the association level of constructs that contain the WXXW pattern within the context of the Ala16 sequence, which serves as a marker for base-line activity for all of the experiments or within a stretch of leucines and alanines (the sequences are shown in Table 3). Both backbones were previously shown to have a low dimerization propensity and were properly inserted within the membrane (14Sal-Man N. Gerber D. Shai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27449-27457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The WXXW motif + backbone exhibited very low dimerization activity compared with the Tar-1 WT TM domain, whereas the WXXW + Ala16 demonstrated moderated dimerization propensity. In contrast, the QXXS motif, which is able to stabilize dimerization independently of its TM sequence, showed a dimerization activity similar to the Tar-1 WT TM domain when inserted within the backbone construct (Fig. 5). Unfortunately, the QXXS motif within the Ala16 sequence was unable to insert properly into the membrane (14Sal-Man N. Gerber D. Shai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27449-27457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and therefore is not shown. Overall, the results indicate that, although the QXXS motif functions as a general dimerization motif, the aromatic pair WXXW can stabilize association in a sequence-specific manner. All constructs exhibited expression levels similar to the Tar-1 WT TM domain and were correctly integrated into the membrane (data not shown).TABLE 3TM sequences used to determine the sensitivity of the aromati"

TA systems usually consist of two genes: the toxin gene encodes a stable protein whereas the antitoxin gene encodes either a labile protein or an untranslated, antisense RNA species. The toxic effect is neutralized by inhibition of toxin translation when the antitoxin is an RNA (type I), or by strong binding of the cognate antitoxin when the antitoxin is a protein (type II). When encoded on plasmids, TA systems were known as “addiction modules,” because cells which lose these plasmids would be killed, thus causing the cells to be “addicted” to the short-lived antitoxin product because its de novo synthesis is essential for cell survival (1Hayes F. Science. 2003; 301: 1496-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 2Gerdes K. Christensen S.K. Lobner-Olesen A. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). Over the past few years, homologs of these plasmid-borne TA systems have been identified on the chromosomes of Escherichia coli and various other bacteria. The discovery of the E. coli-encoded mazEF TA system led to the postulation that TA modules may function as mediators of a type of programmed cell death in bacteria, because the transcription of mazEF was found to be inhibited by various environmental stresses such as nutrient starvation (3Aizenman E. Engelberg-Kulka H. Glaser G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6059-6063Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). The MazE antitoxin is relatively unstable compared with the MazF toxin and any inhibition of mazEF transcription would “activate” MazF and lead to cell death. E. coli was therefore hypothesized to undergo altruistic cell death, thus helping to ensure the survival of the population during adverse conditions (3Aizenman E. Engelberg-Kulka H. Glaser G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6059-6063Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). The MazF toxin was found to exert its lethality by functioning as a sequence-specific endoribonuclease (4Zhang Y. Zhang J. Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Qing G. Inouye M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Since then, several homologs of MazF from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (5Zhu L. Zhang Y. Teh J.S. Zhang J. Connell N. Rubin H. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18638-18643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and Bacillus subtilis (6Pellegrini O. Mathy N. Gogos A. Shapiro L. Condon C. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 1139-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) have been demonstrated to be functional endoribonucleases and are lethal when overexpressed in E. coli. Another toxin that was found to act as an endoribonuclease is the RelE toxin of the relBE TA system encoded on the E. coli chromosome. However, RelE was reported to cleave mRNA molecules within ribosomes but not as free transcripts like for MazF, and the RelE-mediated cleavage of mRNA is dependent on translation (7Christensen S.K. Gerdes K. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1389-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Experiments conducted with RelE showed that while the toxin-afflicted cells cannot form colonies, they do not lyse and can be rescued from this “dormant” state by subsequent expression of the cognate antitoxin (8Pedersen K. Christensen S.K. Gerdes K. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). TA systems were therefore proposed to be stress response elements rather than mediators of programmed cell death, as these toxins induce a reversible stasis that enable cells to survive episodes of extreme nutritional stress (2Gerdes K. Christensen S.K. Lobner-Olesen A. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). A survey of sequenced genomes indicated the widespread occurrence of TA systems among free living prokaryotes and these chromosomally encoded TA systems could be divided into eight families: RelBE, ParDE, HigBA, VapBC, MazEF, Phd/Doc, CcdAB, and epsilon-zeta (2Gerdes K. Christensen S.K. Lobner-Olesen A. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar, 9Pandey D.P. Gerdes K.

The epsilon-zeta system was initially identified as an addiction module encoded on plasmid pSM19035 of S. pyogenes with epsilon functioning as the cognate antitoxin to the zeta toxin. The epsilon, zeta, and omega genes form an operon on pSM19035 with the omega gene product acting as a repressor of transcription for omega-epsilon-zeta along with other transcription units on pSM19035 (10Ceglowski P. Boitsov A. Chai S. Alonso J.C. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 136: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 11Ceglowski P. Boitsov A. Karamyan N. Chai S. Alonso J.C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 241: 579-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The products of the epsilon and zeta genes were shown to form a stable epsilon2zeta2 heterotetramer (12Meinhart A. Alonso J.C. Strater N. Saenger W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1661-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 13Camacho A.G. Misselwitz R. Behlke J. Ayora S. Welfle K. Meinhart A. Lara B. Saenger W. Welfle H. Alonso J.C. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 1701-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The toxic protein zeta contains a highly conserved Walker-A motif for ATP/GTP binding, as well as a phosphoryltransferase active site. Epsilon neutralizes the toxicity of zeta by blocking access to the phosphoryltransferase active site through formation of a tight complex with zeta (12Meinhart A. Alonso J.C. Strater N. Saenger W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1661-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, the mode of action of the zeta toxin remained elusive. A homolog of zeta was found to be encoded in the genome of the Gram-positive pathogen S. pneumoniae which harbors at least five other TA loci (12Meinhart A. Alonso J.C. Strater N. Saenger W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1661-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Two of these pneumococcal TA loci, namely relBE-2Spn and yefM-yoeBSpn, were recently shown to be functional TA systems (14Nieto C. Pellicer T. Balsa D. Christensen S.K. Gerdes K. Espinosa M. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 1280-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 15Nieto C. Cherny I. Khoo S.K. de Lacoba M.G. Chan W.T. Yeo C.C. Gazit E. Espinosa M. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 1266-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In this report, we present the crystal structure of the pneumococcal epsilon-zeta homolog, designated PezAT (for pneumococcal epsilon-zeta) and show that it is a functional TA system, with PezA as the cognate antitoxin to the PezT toxin. We also show that pezAT is negatively autoregulated and, unlike the omega-epsilon-zeta system, PezA functions as a transcriptional repressor with PezT as a co-repressor. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—E. coli DH5α was used as a host strain for most of the cloning experiments and transcriptional analyses using lacZ fusions. Cloning of recombinant bait and target vectors for bacterial two hybrid assays was performed in E. coli XL-Blue MRF′ Km (Stratagene). BacterioMatch II E. coli validation reporter (Stratagene) was co-transformed with both bait and target pairs to enable detection of protein-protein interactions through transcriptional activation of the HIS reporter gene. E. coli BL21(DE3)/pLysS was used as the host strain to investigate the effect of the expression of the pezAT genes on cellular growth and E. coli BL21(DE3)/Codon Plus-RIL strain (Stratagene) was used for overexpression of the PezA and PezT proteins for purification. All cultures were grown in LB medium (Difco) at 37 °C unless otherwise stated. When necessary, the growth media was supplemented with antibiotics at the following concentrations: ampicillin (Ap), 100 μg/ml; kanamycin (Km), 50 μg/ml; chloramphenicol (Cm), 34 μg/ml for maintenance of E. coli BL21 strains, and 10 μg/ml for the bacterial two-hybrid assay strains. Construction of Plasmids for Overexpression of PezA and PezT in E. coli—The pezT open reading frame was PCR-amplified from the S. pneumoniae genome using the primer pair PezT-F and PezT-R (for these and all other primer sequences see supplemental Table 1). The 762-bp PCR fragment obtained was initially cloned into the pGEM-T Easy PCR cloning vector (Promega). The resulting recombinant pGEM-PezT plasmid was digested to release the cloned pezT fragment, which was then ligated into pET11a to generate a pET11a-PezT plasmid. Similarly, a DNA fragment spanning both the pezA and pezT genes was PCR-amplified using the primers PezA-F and PezT-R, producing a single 1236-bp PCR product, which was then digested and cloned into pET11a resulting in a construct designated pET11a-PezAT. For separate expression of PezA, the open reading frame was cloned into pET28a by amplification with the primers PezA-EcoRI-F and PezA-XhoI-R and the restriction digested 477-bp fragment was ligated into pET28a resulting in a pET28a-PezA recombinant plasmid. For protein purification, both the pezAT and pezA open reading frames were each cloned into the pET28a vector such that their expression would result in an N-terminal hexa-histidine fusion protein. The construct expressing the pezAT open reading frame, pET28a-(His)6-PezAT, was obtained using the primers PezA-F and PezT-R for amplification, whereas the pezA construct, designated pET28a-(His)6-PezA, was generated with the primers PezA-F and PezA-R for amplification. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed as described in Ref. 16Meinhart A. Silberzahn T. Cramer P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15917-15921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar. Cell Viability Assay—E. coli BL21(DE3)/pLysS cells were individually transformed with either pET11a-PezT or pET11a-PezAT and co-transformed with pET11a-PezT together with pET28a-PezA. Overnight cultures of E. coli BL21(DE3)/pLysS carrying the recombinant pET11a plasmids were diluted to an A600 of ∼0.02 in fresh LB broth supplemented with Ap and Cm and cells were allowed to grow at 37 °C to an A600 of ∼0.45. Cells carrying pET28a recombinant plasmids were grown in the presence of Km instead of Ap. Overexpression of the cloned genes was induced at mid-log phase (A600 ∼ 0.45) by addition of 1 mm IPTG and A600 values were monitored at hourly intervals for up to 7 h following induction. At the same time intervals, aliquots of the cultures were taken to determine the number of viable cells. Identical overexpression experiments were also conducted with strains grown in M9 minimal medium (Fermentas). Overexpression and Purification of Recombinant (His)6-PezAT and (His)6-PezA—E. coli BL21(DE3)/Codon Plus-RIL were transformed with plasmids pET28a-(His)6-PezAT or pET28a-(His)6-PezA. Cells were grown in LB-medium to an A600 of 0.5 at 37 °C, cooled to 20 °C and protein overproduction was induced with 1 mm IPTG overnight. Selenomethionine labeling was performed according to Ref. 17Van Duyne G.D. Standaert R.F. Karplus P.A. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 105-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar, and induction was performed similarly to wild-type protein. For purification of the PezAT protein complex, cells were harvested by centrifugation and the cell pellet was resuspended in buffer A (see supplemental Table S2 for buffer compositions). Cell walls were broken by sonication, and the slurry was cleared by centrifugation. Affinity chromatography was performed using a Ni-NTA material (Qiagen) equilibrated with buffer A. Unbound sample was removed by washing with buffer A. The protein-complex was eluted with buffer A with additional 250 mm imidazole. Fractions containing the PezAT protein complex were pooled and the N-terminal hexahistidine-tag of PezA was removed by thrombin (GE Healthcare) cleavage in a dialysis against cleavage buffer B at 4 °C for 12 h. The protein-complex was further purified over a MonoQ column (GE Healthcare). Briefly, the dialysed PezAT protein complex was diluted with buffer C and loaded onto the column. The PezAT proteins were eluted in a gradient of up to 600 mm NaCl and were subjected to a final clean-up by size exclusion chromatography using Superose 6 (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer D. Selenomethionine-labeled PezAT proteins were purified similarly to the wild type protein with the addition of 5 mm DTE throughout all purification steps. For purification of PezA, harvested cells were resuspended in buffer I, and the cells were lysed by sonication. The cell debris was cleared by ultracentrifugation and the crude lysate was subsequently subjected to ammonium sulfate fractionation to a final concentration of 40% saturation. After centrifugation, the pellet was dissolved in and dialyzed against buffer J. The proteins were further applied onto a HisTrap HP affinity column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer J. Following extensive washing with buffer J, the bound proteins were eluted from the column using buffer J containing 500 mm imidazole. For purification of the mutated variant PezT(K45A), harvested cells were resuspended in buffer E. After cell lysis by sonication, the cleared supernatant was loaded over a HisTrap FF column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer E. Non-specifically bound proteins were removed in a high salt wash with buffer E containing additional 500 mm NaCl, and bound proteins were eluted in a gradient to 500 mm imidazole. The pooled protein fractions were diluted with buffer F prior to loading on a heparin column (GE Healthcare), equilibrated with buffer G. PezT(K45A) was then eluted in a gradient to 600 mm NaCl. Fractions containing PezT(K45A) were further purified over Superose 12 (GE Healthcare) size exclusion column equilibrated with buffer H. For crystallization experiments, the protein was concentrated to 17 mg/ml. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Protein purity, complete cleavage of the hexahistidine tag and incorporation of selenomethionine were monitored by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF MS). Mass Spectrometry—MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis was performed in the linear, positive ion mode with blanking (<700 m/z) and pulsed (time-delayed) extraction using a Shimadzu Biotech Axima TOF2 instrument (Shimadzu Biotech Germany). All reagents and protein standards were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Sinapinic acid (10 mg/ml in 50% acetonitrile, 50% of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (all % v/v)) was used as a matrix. Sample positions on the steel 384-position sample plate were washed once with matrix solution. A 1-μl drop of the protein preparation or 1 μl of water into which the crystal was transferred with the cryoprotectant was allowed to dry onto the sample plate at room temperature and the preparation was then washed with a small drop of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid applied for ∼10 s. Immediately after removal of the trifluoroacetic acid, 1 μl of matrix solution was added to the sample and it was allowed to dry at room temperature. The standard proteins (about 1 pmol of insulin, ubiquitin, cytochrome c, myoglobin, chymotrypsinogen A, aldolase, bovine serum albumin, conalbumin, or β-galactosidase) were spotted onto the washed plate and an equal volume (usually 1 μl) of matrix was immediately added to the protein drop. Each protein standard was analyzed separately and a combined calibration of the near external standards was employed to determine the mass/charge (m/z) values. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—ITC was performed using a VP-ITC microcalorimeter (MicroCal Inc.). Data were analyzed using the Origin-based software provided by the manufacturer. A buffer exchange to buffer D was performed by size exclusion chromatography and protein concentrations were determined according to their absorbance at 280 nm. Titrations were carried out at 15 °C and, in a typical experiment, 3 μm PezT(K45A) were loaded into the sample cell and titrated against 30 μm PezA in the injection syringe. Protein Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystals of the PezAT protein complex were obtained from drops made of 1.5 μl of protein solution and 1.5 μl of precipitant solution (12.5 to 15% (v/v) isopropyl alcohol, 100 mm MES-NaOH, pH 6.0) in a hanging-drop vapor diffusion setup at 293 K. Crystal size was optimized by adding 1 to 6% (v/v) of a 30% (v/v) dioxane stock solution to the mixed crystallization drop. Single individual crystals grew to a maximum size of about 300 × 100 × 50 μm3 within 2 weeks. Before flash-cooling in liquid nitrogen, crystals were harvested into precipitant solution with additional 10% (v/v) glycerol, and the glycerol concentration was increased stepwise to 30% (v/v) for cryo protection. Native and anomalous diffraction data were collected at beamline PXII at the Swiss Light Source with the crystals kept at 90 K. The datasets were processed and scaled using XDS (18Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3232) Google Scholar). The selenium sites were located with the program SHELXD (19Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). Initial phase improvement and density modification was performed with SHELXE (20Sheldrick G.M. Z. Kristallog. 2002; 217: 644-650Crossref Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Model building was performed with the program “O” (21Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13868) Google Scholar) in the later stage of refinement. The overall quality of the structure was evaluated by PROCHECK (24Laskowski R.A. Mac Arthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). In Vivo Detection of Protein-Protein Interaction Using a Bacterial Two-hybrid System—The BacterioMatch II Two-Hybrid System Vector Kit (Stratagene) was employed according to the manufacturer's instructions to investigate in vivo interactions between PezA and PezT. Both pezA and pezT were separately cloned as fusion proteins with the λcI repressor into pBT as bait constructs and in frame with the RNAPα reading frame into pTRG as target vectors. In the case of pezA, DNA fragments were amplified using the primer pair BPezA-F and BPezA-R and cloned into the pBT bait vector for the bait construct pBT-PezA. The recombinant target of pezA was generated by PCR using primer pair TPezA-F and BPezA-R and cloned into pTRG for the target construct pTRG-PezA. For generation of bait and target constructs of pezT, an intermediate cloning step into the pGEM-T Easy PCR cloning vector (Promega) after amplification with the primer pairs PezT1-F and PezT1-R was introduced. Following restriction digest, the isolated pezT DNA fragment was ligated into pBT for the bait construct pBT-PezT and into pTRG for the target vector construct pTRG-PezT. The E. coli reporter strain (Stratagene) was co-transformed with each of the recombinant bait and target pairs (i.e. pBT-PezA and pTRG-PezT pair, or pBT-PezT and pTRG-PezA pair). Positive interaction between the λcI-fusion protein produced by the recombinant pBT and the RNAPα-fusion protein produced by the recombinant pTRG was monitored by growth of the reporter strain co-transformants on the selective medium containing 5 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT). RNA Preparation and Reverse Transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR)—Total RNA samples were prepared from E. coli cultures using an RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The total RNA concentrations were determined by UV spectrophotometry, and the sample integrity was checked by agarose gel electrophoresis. RT-PCR was carried out using 400 ng of total RNA with the Access RT-PCR System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's procedure. The gene specific primers 1050-F, 1050-R, 1051-F, and 1051-R were used in the RT-PCR analysis. Construction of lacZ Transcriptional Fusions and β-Galactosidase Assays to Detect Promoter Activity—Four constructs spanning different regions of the pezAT operon were amplified and subsequently ligated into the vector pQF52 (25McLean B.W. Wiseman S.L. Kropinski A.M. Can. J. Microbiol. 1997; 43: 981-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) to obtain different lacZ transcriptional fusions for the detection of promoter activity. First, the putative promoter region upstream from pezA was amplified using the primer pair upPezA-F and upPezA-R yielding a 209-bp fragment, which was cloned into pQF52 resulting in the pQF-PezAup construct. Second, the promoter region together with pezA was amplified (using the upPezA-F and lacZ_PezA-R primers) as a 712-bp fragment, which was then cloned to generate pQF-PezA. Third, the entire pezAT operon (1388-bp DNA fragment) along with its promoter region was obtained with the primer pair upPezA-F and lacZ_PezT-R for the recombinant pQF-PezAT. Finally, pQFPe-zTup was constructed by ligation of pQF52 with a 233-bp fragment that contained a truncated pezA reading frame that was amplified using the primer pair PezA283-F and PezA-R. E. coli DH5α was transformed with the recombinant pQF52 plasmids and transformants were assayed for β-galactosidase activity (when A600 reached ∼0.5) according to the method of Miller (26Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar), using SDS and chloroform to permeabilize the cells. Determination of lacZ Transcript Levels using Quantitative Real-time RT PCR—The LightCycler RNA master SYBR Green I kit (Roche Applied Science) was used to carry out quantitative real-time RT-PCR on the LightCycler 2.0 (Roche Applied Science) for the detection of lacZ transcript levels using the primer pair lacZ-F and lacZ-R. Total RNA from E. coli DH5α harboring the various pQF-derived recombinants were extracted using the RNeasy mini kit. Reverse transcription was carried out at 61 °C for 20 min, and the cDNA/RNA hybrid was then denatured at 95 °C for 30 s. After that, 45 cycles of real-time PCR amplification were carried out using the following parameters: denaturation for 1 s at 95 °C, annealing for 5 s at 5 °C below the predicted melting temperature of the primer pair, and elongation for 13 s at 72 °C. The E. coli-encoded 16S rRNA gene was used as a housekeeping control (using the primer pair 16S-F and 16S-R). The relative expression ratio of the target gene, lacZ, was calculated based on its real-time PCR efficiencies (E) and the crossing point difference (ΔCP) for an unknown sample versus a control using the mathematical model published by Pfaffl (27Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (25573) Google Scholar). For each gene (i.e. lacZ or 16S rRNA), cDNA dilution curves were generated and used to calculate the individual real-time PCR efficiencies with the values for the slopes obtained using the LightCycler 4.0 software (Roche Applied Science). For each sample, at least three different real-time RT PCR reactions were carried out from which the mean CP value was obtained utilizing the LightCycler 4.0 software (Roche Applied Science). Determination of the Transcriptional Start Site using 5′-RACE—The transcriptional start site of the pezAT operon was determined using 5′-RACE (Version 2.0; Invitrogen), following the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA was extracted from E. coli DH5α harboring the pQF-PezAT recombinant plasmid and was subjected to first strand cDNA synthesis using 20 ng of GSP1 primer, which was designed to anneal 399-bp downstream of the pezA start codon. A homopolymeric tail was then added to the 3′-end of the synthesized cDNA using terminal deoxytransferase and dCTP. The dC-tailed cDNA was then PCR-amplified using the provided anchor primer, which was complementary to the homopolymeric tail, and a nested primer, GSP2, located 121-bp downstream of the pezA start codon. The amplified product was purified and sequenced to determine the transcriptional start site, which would be the nucleotide that is immediately after the poly(G) tail. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—A 203-bp DNA fragment containing palindrome sequence PS, which is the putative regulatory protein binding site, was PCR-amplified using the primer pair PS-F and PS-R, purified and labeled with biotin using the Biotin 3′-End DNA Labeling kit (Pierce). Subsequent electrophoretic mobility shift assays were carried out using the LightShift chemiluminescent EMSA kit (Pierce). Biotinylated DNA (20 fmol) was incubated at room temperature for 20 min with 50 ng/μl polydeoxyinosinic-polydeoxycytydilic acid [poly(dI-dC)] and different amounts of purified protein (either PezA or the PezAT protein complex) in binding buffer K. Nucleoprotein complexes were separated from free DNA by electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA buffer and subsequently transferred onto a nylon membrane. The biotin end-labeled DNA was detected using a streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate and the supplied chemiluminescent substrate. Sequence Analysis—A homolog of the S. pyogenes plasmid pSM19035-encoded zeta toxin was found in the genome sequence of S. pneumoniae TIGR4. The PezT protein encoded by the sp1051 reading frame shares 42% sequence identity with zeta (Fig. 1A) suggesting that both proteins have similar functions in different Streptococcal species. However, a BLAST search for the corresponding antitoxin homolog to the epsilon protein in the genome sequence of S. pneumoniae did not yield any positive results. As TA systems are usually organized as operons, the reading frames that flank sp1051 were further analyzed. Interestingly, pairwise amino acid sequence alignment of the upstream open reading frame sp1050 gene product PezA with epsilon indicated that the C-terminal residues 70–158 of PezA share 21% sequence identity with epsilon (Fig. 1A).

https://openalex.org/W2086866869,"ATM (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated) is an essential checkpoint kinase that signals DNA double-strand breaks in eukaryotes. Its depletion causes meiotic and somatic defects in Arabidopsis and progressive motor impairment accompanied by several cell deficiencies in patients with ataxia telangiectasia (AT). To obtain a comprehensive view of the ATM pathway in plants, we performed a time-course analysis of seedling responses by combining confocal laser scanning microscopy studies of root development and genome-wide expression profiling of wild-type (WT) and homozygous ATM-deficient mutants challenged with a dose of gamma-rays (IR) that is sublethal for WT plants. Early morphologic defects in meristematic stem cells indicated that AtATM, an Arabidopsis homolog of the human ATM gene, is essential for maintaining the quiescent center and controlling the differentiation of initial cells after exposure to IR. Results of several microarray experiments performed with whole seedlings and roots up to 5 h post-IR were compiled in a single table, which was used to import gene information and extract gene sets. Sequence and function homology searches; import of spatio-temporal, cell cycling, and mutant-constitutive expression characteristics; and a simplified functional classification system were used to identify novel genes in all functional classes. The hundreds of radiomodulated genes identified were not a random collection, but belonged to functional pathways such as those of the cell cycle; cell death and repair; DNA replication, repair, and recombination; and transcription; translation; and signaling, indicating the strong cell reprogramming and double-strand break abrogation functions of ATM checkpoints. Accordingly, genes in all functional classes were either down or up-regulated concomitantly with downregulation of chromatin deacetylases or upregulation of acetylases and methylases, respectively. Determining the early transcriptional indicators of prolonged S-G2 phases that coincided with cell proliferation delay, or an anticipated subsequent auxin increase, accelerated cell differentiation or death, was used to link IR-regulated hallmark functions and tissue phenotypes after IR. The transcription burst was almost exclusively AtATM-dependent or weakly AtATR-dependent, and followed two major trends of expression in atm: (i)-loss or severe attenuation and delay, and (ii)-inverse and/or stochastic, as well as specific, enabling one to distinguish IR/ATM pathway constituents. Our data provide a large resource for studies on the interaction between plant checkpoints of the cell cycle, development, hormone response, and DNA repair functions, because IR-induced transcriptional changes partially overlap with the response to environmental stress. Putative connections of ATM to stem cell maintenance pathways after IR are also discussed."

Causative for SCA3 is an expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat in the MJD1 gene that is translated into an expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) segment in the corresponding ataxin-3 (AT3) protein (1Ikeda H. Yamaguchi M. Sugai S. Aze Y. Narumiya S. Kakizuka A. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 196-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). The polyQ tract in AT3 is normally 12 to 39 Gln long and expansion beyond 45 Gln results in disease. A unifying neuropathological feature of this and other polyQ diseases is the accumulation of protein deposits (inclusions) in a specific subset of neurons. These inclusions are mainly composed of the pathological polyQ protein but also contain molecular chaperones, transcription factors, ubiquitin, and components of the proteasome machinery (2Paulson H.L.

These observations gave rise to the “toxic fragment hypothesis,” which suggests that proteolytic production of polyQ-containing fragments is a prerequisite for the manifestation of polyQ diseases. The detection of a ∼36-kDa polyQ fragment of AT3 in brain cells of mice transgenic for full-length AT3 with 71 Gln (∼65 kDa) supports this notion in the case of SCA3. Appearance of this fragment was linked closely with neuropathological symptoms, and a similar fragment was observed in brain samples of SCA3 patients (17Goti D. Katzen S.M. Mez J. Kurtis N. Kiluk J. Ben-Haiem L. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Kakizuka A. Sharp A.H. Ross C.A. Mouton P.R. Colomer V. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 10266-10279Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar).

Here we found that AT3 is proteolyzed in cell lysates in a calcium-dependent manner. The absence of caspase-3 activation under these conditions and inhibitor studies implicated the family of calpains as processing enzymes. Addition of recombinant calpain II increased the basal rate of AT3 fragmentation without changing the fragment pattern. In a limited proteolysis experiment with recombinant AT3 and calpain II, fragments similar in size to those observed in cells were obtained and identified by microsequencing. In mouse neuroblastoma (N2a) and human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells we found that AT3 fragmentation is increased by the calcium ionophore ionomycin and suppressed by calpeptin. In cells expressing polyQ-expanded AT3, addition of calpeptin or co-expression of the cell-innate calpain inhibitor calpastatin also suppressed the formation of SDS-resistant aggregates. Based on these findings, calpains appear to have an important role in SCA3 pathology and thus represent promising targets for therapeutic intervention. Expression Constructs—FLAG- and Myc-tagged AT3, truncated C-terminal Myc-tagged expression constructs, and His-AT3Q22 were described previously (8Haacke A. Broadley S.A. Boteva R. Tzvetkov N. Hartl F.U. Breuer P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 555-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). DNA was routinely prepared from Escherichia coli SURE cells (Stratagene). The pRK5 expression plasmid with human full-length calpastatin cDNA was a kind gift from Dr. Glenn C. Telling, University of Kentucky, Lexington (30Yadavalli R. Guttmann R.P. Seward T. Centers A.P. Williamson R.A. Telling G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21948-21956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Protein Purification—Protein purification was carried out by standard procedures as described previously (8Haacke A. Broadley S.A. Boteva R. Tzvetkov N. Hartl F.U. Breuer P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 555-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In brief, proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21 upon induction with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside for 3 h at 30 °C. Collected cells were disrupted by lysozyme and sonication in buffer A (50 mm sodium-phosphate, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor mixture (Complete; Roche Applied Science)) containing 1% Triton X-100. The 30,000 × g supernatant was incubated with 3 ml of glutathione-agarose (Sigma) for 30 min at 4 °C. Beads were washed with buffer A/1 m NaCl/1% Triton X-100 and eluted with buffer A containing 20 mm reduced glutathione followed by dialysis against buffer B (20 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol). His6-tagged AT3 proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS and purified by standard procedures using Ni2+-NTA (Qiagen) followed by anion exchange chromatography on Source Q columns (Amersham Biosciences). Purification of His6-TBP was described elsewhere (7Schaffar G. Breuer P. Boteva R. Behrends C. Tzvetkov N. Strippel N. Sakahira H. Siegers K. Hayer-Hartl M. Hartl F.U. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 95-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Antibodies—A polyclonal antiserum against rat AT3 was raised in rabbits by standard procedures and affinity-purified with GST-AT3Q22 (human sequence) cross-linked to glutathione-agarose as described previously (8Haacke A. Broadley S.A. Boteva R. Tzvetkov N. Hartl F.U. Breuer P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 555-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (clone 9E10) and the polyclonal anti-caspase-3 (H-277) and monoclonal anti-polyQ antibodies (clone 1C2) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and Chemicon, respectively. The monoclonal anti-actin antibody (clone N350) and the monoclonal anti-TBP antibody were purchased from Amersham Biosciences and Abcam, respectively. Cell Culture—Mouse neuroblastoma N2a and human embryonic kidney 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (BiochromAG) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For transient transfections, 70% confluent cells on 35-mm dishes were transfected with 2 μg of DNA using Lipofectamine PLUS reagents (Invitrogen). For the preparation of lysates, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped in lysis buffer (1× Tris-buffered saline containing 0.2% Triton X-100, 10 mm MgCl2, and protease inhibitor mixture (Complete; Roche Applied Science)) and incubated with benzonase (Roche Applied Science, 75 units/3 cm-plate) for 1 h at 4 °C. Calpeptin (Calbiochem) dissolved in Me2SO was added to cells in the concentrations indicated. When cells were cultured with 50 μm calpeptin for up to 72 h, calpeptin dissolved in fresh medium was added 3 h post-transfection and replaced every 24 h. Ionomycin (Sigma) was dissolved in Me2SO and applied to cells in concentrations of 1–5 μm in Optimum minimal Eagle′s medium (OptiMEM) (Invitrogen) together with 2 mm CaCl2. Filter Retardation Assays—Filter retardation assays were described previously (8Haacke A. Broadley S.A. Boteva R. Tzvetkov N. Hartl F.U. Breuer P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 555-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In brief, cell lysates were filtered through a cellulose acetate membrane (0.2-μm pores; Schleicher & Schuell). Aggregates retained on the membrane were detected with the anti-Myc antibody and the enhanced chemifluorescence system (Amersham Biosciences). Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis was performed by standard procedures. Before probing membranes with different antibodies, bound antibodies were removed by incubation in stripping buffer (63 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.7, 2% SDS, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol) for 1 h at 50 °C followed by extensive washes in Tris-buffered saline. Preparation of N2a Postnuclear Supernatant—Confluently grown N2a cells were washed with ice-cold 25 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.6, and incubated with 200 mm sucrose for 20 min on ice. After removing the sucrose solution, the swollen cells were collected in 250 mm sucrose, 3 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, and disrupted with a Dounce homogenizer (Glas-Col). A centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C removed intact cells and nuclei. The remaining postnuclear supernatant (PNS) was adjusted to 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, and 100 mm KCl. The protein concentration was determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay. Freshly prepared PNS containing 100 μg of protein was incubated with 50 ng of PreScission Protease (PP)-cleaved GST-AT3Q22 for 1 h at 30 °C shaking at 300 rpm. When indicated, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 100 μm ALLN, 2 mm EGTA, 10 μm E-64, 15 μm pepstatin, 0.2 mm leupeptin, 1.5 μm aprotinin, 40–100 μm Z-VAD-FMK (benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone), 40–100 μm Z-DEVD-FMK, 40–100 μm Ac-YVAD-CHO, or 20 μm MG132 were added. The ATP-regenerating system contained 2 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 8 mm creatine phosphate (Roche Applied Science), and 50 μg/ml creatine kinase (rabbit muscle; Roche Applied Science). Recombinant calpain II was added together with an additional 1.5 mm MgCl2. FACS Analysis—Cells were processed for 1,2-bis-(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA-AM; Molecular Probes) and annexin V/propidium iodide (Calbiochem) staining 48 h after transfection following the suppliers' instructions and analyzed with a Facs-Calibur instrument (BD Biosciences). Limited Proteolysis and Peptide Sequencing—Purified AT3 proteins (His-AT3Q22 or PP-cleaved GST-AT3Q22), recombinant TATA-binding protein (His-TBPQ38), and rabbit muscle actin (Sigma) were incubated with recombinant rat calpain II (Calbiochem) in 20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.6, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm CaCl2 for 30 min at 22 °C. After SDS-PAGE, protein processing was analyzed by Western blotting or Edman N-terminal sequencing with phenylthiohydantoin chemistry and separation of amino acid derivatives by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography. Calpain Inhibitors Attenuate Calcium-dependent Fragmentation of AT3 in Cell Lysates—AT3 is processed in mammalian cells by yet unknown proteases (8Haacke A. Broadley S.A. Boteva R. Tzvetkov N. Hartl F.U. Breuer P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 555-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 17Goti D. Katzen S.M. Mez J. Kurtis N. Kiluk J. Ben-Haiem L. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Kakizuka A. Sharp A.H. Ross C.A. Mouton P.R. Colomer V. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 10266-10279Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). To obtain information about the cellular enzymes involved, we investigated the proteolysis of AT3 in PNS of N2a cell lysates (Fig. 1a). Addition of magnesium chloride or an ATP-regenerating system did not result in enhanced fragmentation of AT3. Lowering of the pH was similarly ineffective. In contrast, the addition of calcium chloride triggered the production of AT3 fragments (Fig. 1a). Procaspase-3 was not processed to the active p17 fragment, indicating that a caspase-mediated cell death cascade was not activated under these conditions (Fig. 1a). A similar CaCl2-dependent sensitivity of endogenous human AT3 was observed in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1b). We further tested a variety of protease inhibitors (Fig. 1c). While purified recombinant human AT3Q22 was not sensitive to CaCl2, the endogenous mouse protein contained in the PNS was hydrolyzed to generate mainly a ∼29-kDa fragment upon addition of CaCl2 (Fig. 1c). Similarly, processing of the human protein into 20-, 24-, and 34-kDa fragments required PNS and was enhanced by the addition of CaCl2 (Fig. 1c). The calpain/proteasome inhibitors ALLN and MG132 (31Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 397-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar) and the cysteine/serine protease inhibitor leupeptin inhibited the calcium-dependent cleavage of human AT3, whereas the cysteine protease inhibitor E-64 had only a weak effect. In contrast, the aspartyl protease inhibitor pepstatin and the serine protease inhibitor aprotinin did not inhibit cleavage of AT3. Hence, AT3 was likely processed by calcium-dependent cytoplasmic calpain proteases. In support of this conclusion, addition of recombinant calpain II resulted in a 1.8- to 3-fold increase in the production of the AT3 fragments at 16, 20, 24, and 34 kDa (Fig. 1d, compare lane 3 with lanes 5–8). To analyze a possible contribution of caspases in this process, PNS from AT3Q71-expressing cells were treated with CaCl2 and incubated with calpain and caspase inhibitors. Although ALLN inhibited the fragmentation of AT3, caspase inhibitors up to 100 μm were without effect (Fig. 1e). Thus, it appears likely that AT3 cleavage occurred by calpains contained in N2a postnuclear supernatants. Identification of Calpain II Cleavage Sites in AT3 in Vitro—To obtain information about calpain-sensitive regions within AT3, we set up an in vitro assay with recombinant calpain II. Upon incubation with increasing amounts of calpain II in a limited proteolysis assay, several AT3 fragments were detected by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining (Fig. 2a). The N-terminal sequences of the most abundant and stable fragments were determined by microsequencing (Fig. 2a, box). AT3Q22 was cleaved by calpain II in the regions around amino acid residues 60, 200, and 260. An additional cleavage site was found C-terminal to the polyQ stretch (residue 318). Interestingly, fragments of polyQ-expanded AT3 derived from processing around position 260 are highly prone to aggregation in vitro (8Haacke A. Broadley S.A. Boteva R. Tzvetkov N. Hartl F.U. Breuer P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 555-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and in living cells (1Ikeda H. Yamaguchi M. Sugai S. Aze Y. Narumiya S. Kakizuka A. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 196-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 8Haacke A. Broadley S.A. Boteva R. Tzvetkov N. Hartl F.U. Breuer P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 555-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To determine the susceptibility of AT3 toward calpain cleavage, we compared the sensitivity of AT3 to increasing concentrations of calpain II with that of the established calpain substrate actin (32Villa P.G. Henzel W.J. Sensenbrenner M. Henderson C.E. Pettmann B. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 713-722PubMed Google Scholar) and of TATA-binding protein (TBP), another polyQ protein. AT3 was highly calpain-sensitive, with as little as 6 ng of calpain II being sufficient for 50% degradation of 150 ng of AT3 within 30 min at 22 °C, whereas degradation of 150 ng of TBP required ∼4 times more protease. Actin (150 ng) was stable under these conditions up to 50 ng of calpain. These data suggest a high susceptibility of AT3 toward calpain cleavage, consistent with the high sensitivity of AT3 toward calcium-induced proteolysis in PNS. Ionomycin Increases Fragmentation of AT3 in Living Cells—The experiments carried out so far showed that AT3 is sensitive against calpain proteolysis in vitro. To investigate AT3 processing in vivo, cleavage of AT3 was analyzed in neuroblastoma N2a cells upon stimulation or inhibition of calpains. Ionomycin is an ion carrier that increases the cytoplasmic level of Ca2+ ions and thereby activates intracellular calpains (33Liu C. Hermann T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 5892-5894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In N2a cells treated with ionomycin for a sublethal period, the amount of endogenous mouse AT3 and of recombinantly expressed polyQ-expanded AT3Q71 were reduced and fragmentation was increased compared with carrier-treated control cells (Fig. 3a, lanes 1 and 2). The cell-permeable calpain inhibitor calpeptin abolished this effect, indicating the involvement of calpains in AT3 processing (Fig. 3a, lanes 3–5). Although incubation of cells with ionomycin for longer than 1.5 h resulted in toxicity, incubation with calpeptin for several days did not cause overt toxicity. Under these conditions, calpeptin strongly inhibited the formation of SDS-resistant aggregates in cells expressing AT3Q71 without affecting the apparent steady state levels of the protein, as determined by Western blotting with anti-polyQ antibody (Fig. 3b). This suggests that endogenous calpain proteolysis either affects only a small subpopulation of AT3Q71 or is limited to a subset of AT3Q71-expressing cells. Interestingly, in ionomycin-treated cells the polyQ-expanded AT3 was not more sensitive to calpain cleavage than the endogenous mouse AT3 containing 6 Gln (Fig. 3a). Calpastatin Expression Suppresses AT3Q71 Fragmentation and Aggregation—To exclude possible unspecific effects of exogenous calpain inhibitors, we co-expressed the cell-innate calpain inhibitory protein calpastatin. Co-expression of β-galactosidase served as a transfection control. As shown in Fig. 4a, polyQ-expanded ataxin-3 (AT3Q71) was substantially proteolyzed in HEK293 cells. PolyQ-containing fragments accumulated over the time course of expression as determined by Western blotting with antibody 1C2 that recognizes expanded polyQ sequences. The smaller polyQ-containing fragments ranged in size from 25 to 32 kDa and were partly similar in size to the truncated and highly aggregation-prone 257cQ71 protein described recently (Fig. 4a, right panel) (8Haacke A. Broadley S.A. Boteva R. Tzvetkov N. Hartl F.U. Breuer P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 555-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In contrast, calpastatin co-expression clearly inhibited the generation of polyQ-containing fragments (Fig. 4a). Filter assays of cell lysates showed that co-expression reduced the amount of aggregates by ∼90% (Fig. 4b). Notably, intracellular Ca2+ levels remained unaffected in this experimental setup. No increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels was observed by 1,2-bis-(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetra-acetic acid acetoxymethyl ester staining in AT3Q71-expressing cells compared with AT3Q22-expressing cells by fluorescence imaging (supplemental Fig. S1) or FACS analysis (supplemental Table S1). Thus, a basal cellular activity of calpains may be sufficient to generate aggregation-competent fragments of AT3, even though AT3 can be more efficiently cleaved by exogenously activated caspases (supplemental Fig. S2). On the basis of these observations, we propose that calpain cleavage of mutant AT3 generates polyQ-containing fragments that initiate aggregation and pathogenesis. It will be important to determine whether such a mechanism is indeed operational in the brains of transgenic animals expressing polyQ-expanded AT3. We found through a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments that AT3 is a sensitive substrate of calcium-dependent calpain proteases. PNS from N2a cells induced proteolysis of AT3 upon addition of calcium in the absence of apparent caspase-3 activation (Fig. 1). AT3 fragmentation was inhibited by the calcium chelator EGTA, by the calpain inhibitor ALLN, the cysteine protease inhibitors E-64 and leupeptin, and by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 that also inhibits calpains (31Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 397-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1c), whereas caspase inhibitors were without effect (Fig. 1e). Sequence motifs within AT3 that are recognized by calpain II were identified by microsequencing. In agreement with findings by Tompa et al., these motifs are predominantly located in unstructured regions (34Tompa P. Buzder-Lantos P. Tantos A. Farkas A. Szilagyi A. Banoczi Z. Hudecz F.

The recognition sequence around amino acid residue 260 in AT3 is of particular interest because cleavage of polyQ-expanded AT3 in this region is known to produce highly aggregation-prone fragments of ∼32 kDa that can initiate the aggregation process and recruit full-length AT3 into co-aggregates (8Haacke A. Broadley S.A. Boteva R. Tzvetkov N. Hartl F.U. Breuer P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 555-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The production of these polyQ-containing fragments was increased upon ionomycin treatment of AT3Q71-expressing cells, whereas fragmentation and aggregation were inhibited by calpeptin (Fig. 3a). Importantly, the identification of calpain as processing enzyme was corroborated by experiments in which the highly specific innate calpain inhibitor calpastatin was co-expressed with polyQ-expanded AT3. Under these conditions, the generation of polyQ-containing fragments (Fig. 4a) and their aggregation (Fig. 4b) was almost completely suppressed. Based on these findings, we suggest that the cellular calpastatin/calpain system is a promising target for therapeutic intervention in SCA3. A variety of chronic neurodegenerative conditions, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (35Wootz H. Hansson I. Korhonen L. Lindholm D. Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 1890-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), Parkinson disease (36Mouatt-Prigent A. Karlsson J.O. Agid Y. Hirsch E.C. Neuroscience. 1996; 73: 979-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and Alzheimer disease (28Nixon R.A. Saito K.I. Grynspan F. Griffin W.R. Katayama S. Honda T. Mohan P.S. Shea T.B. Beermann M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 747: 77-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) are accompanied by altered levels of calpains and/or its inhibitor calpastatin (reviewed in Ref. 37Chan S.L. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 58: 167-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Furthermore, evidence for a dysregulation of cellular calcium homeostasis in polyQ diseases has been provided for Huntington disease (24Gafni J. Hermel E. Young J.E. Wellington C.L. Hayden M.R. Ellerby L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20211-20220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and SCA1 (38Lin X. Antalffy B. Kang D. Orr H.T. Zoghbi H.Y. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). In the latter case, down-regulation of proteins involved in glutamate metabolism and in calcium signaling and homeostasis was shown to precede pathological symptoms in a transgenic mouse model. Early down-regulation of the Ca2+-binding proteins parvalbumin and calbindin has been demonstrated in a similar model (39Vig P.J. Subramony S.H. Qin Z. McDaniel D.O. Fratkin J.D. J. Neurol. Sci. 2000; 174: 100-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These observations would suggest that calpains can act on polyQ proteins early in disease and without being strongly activated as a result of an apoptotic program. In fact, in a late onset mouse model of Huntington disease and in postmortem brains of affected individuals, pathogenesis was shown to occur independently from necrotic or apoptotic cell death (40Turmaine M. Raza A. Mahal A. Mangiarini L. Bates G.P. Davies S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8093-8097Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). In accordance with these findings, we found no effect of caspase inhibitors (Fig. 1e) and we did not observe signs of necrosis or the induction of apoptotic cell death upon expression of AT3 in our cell culture model (supplemental Fig. S3). A basal, low level activity of calpains might thus be responsible for the constitutive production of AT3 fragments that may eventually exceed a critical concentration and become cytotoxic. However, this process may be accelerated in individual neurons following excitotoxic stimuli that transiently disturb intracellular Ca2+ levels. Additionally, cellular systems that normally cope with the load of aberrant molecular species, such as molecular chaperones or the ubiquitin proteasome system, may become overwhelmed, thereby facilitating disease manifestation. Further work on animal models will be required to clarify these issues. We thank Ramunas M. Vabulas for valuable help with the FACS analysis and critical reading of the manuscript.

Genetic deficiency of C1 inhibitor results in hereditary angioedema, a dominantly inheritable, potentially lethal disease. Here we report the first crystal structure of the serpin domain of human C1 inhibitor, representing a previously unreported latent form, which explains functional consequences of several naturally occurring mutations, two of which are discussed in detail. The presented structure displays a novel conformation with a seven-stranded β-sheet A. The unique conformation of the C-terminal six residues suggests its potential role as a barrier in the active-latent transition. On the basis of surface charge pattern, heparin affinity measurements, and docking of a heparin disaccharide, a heparin binding site is proposed in the contact area of the serpin-proteinase encounter complex. We show how polyanions change the activity of the C1 inhibitor by a novel “sandwich” mechanism, explaining earlier reaction kinetic and mutagenesis studies. These results may help to improve therapeutic C1 inhibitor preparations used in the treatment of hereditary angioedema, organ transplant rejection, and heart attack.

These results may help to improve therapeutic C1 inhibitor preparations used in the treatment of hereditary angioedema, organ transplant rejection, and heart attack. C1 inhibitor belongs to the group of serpin-type proteinase inhibitors in blood plasma. Serpins act as pseudosubstrates of serine and cysteine proteinases (although there are noninhibitory serpins as well) (1Gettins P.G.W. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4751-4803Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). A conformational change is triggered in the serpin upon peptide bond cleavage, which distorts the active site of proteinase and traps it in an inactive, covalently linked serpin-enzyme complex (2Huntington J.A. Read R.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar, 3Dementiev A. Dobó J. Gettins P.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3452-3457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Serpins are vital down-regulator components of proteolytic signal amplification cascades. Human C1 inhibitor (C1-inh) 4The abbreviations used are: C1-inh, C1 inhibitor; rC1-inh, recombinant C1 inhibitor; HAE, hereditary angioedema; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; RCL, reactive center loop; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; fXIIa and fXIa, factor XIIa and XIa, respectively. is the only inhibitor that acts on early components of the classical pathway (C1r and C1s) and on that of the lectin pathway (MASP-1 and MASP-2) of the complement system (4Bos I.G.A. Hack C.E. Abrahams J.P. Immunobiology. 2002; 205: 518-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Complement mediates host defense against pathogens and altered host cells, but its uncontrolled activation could be harmful. Other physiologically crucial targets include plasma kallikrein and activated factor XII (fXIIa) of the contact activation and activated factor XI (fXIa) of the intrinsic coagulation systems (4Bos I.G.A. Hack C.E. Abrahams J.P. Immunobiology. 2002; 205: 518-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Apart from proteinase inhibition, it was recently discovered that C1-inh binds the central component C3b of complement (5Jiang H. Wagner E. Zhang H. Frank M.M. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 1609-1616Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), endotoxins from bacteria (6Liu D. Cai S. Gu X. Scafidi J. Wu X. Davis A.E. II I J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 2594-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and E-, P-selectin adhesion proteins on endothelial cells (7Cai S. Davis A.E. J. Immunol. 2003; 171 (3rd.): 4786-4791Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). C1-inh is a single-chain glycoprotein that has atypical two-domain architecture (8Odermatt E. Berger H. Sano Y. FEBS Lett. 1981; 131: 283-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) with the C-terminal serpin and the unique N-terminal domains (9Bock S.C. Skriver K. Nielsen E. Thøgersen H-C. Wiman B. Donaldson V.H. Eddy R.L. Marrinan J. Radziejewska E. Huber R. Shows T.B. Magnusson S. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4292-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). C1-inh is extensively modified post-translationally, bearing six N-linked carbohydrates. Sequencing analysis revealed 14 potential O-glycosylation sites (9Bock S.C. Skriver K. Nielsen E. Thøgersen H-C. Wiman B. Donaldson V.H. Eddy R.L. Marrinan J. Radziejewska E. Huber R. Shows T.B. Magnusson S. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4292-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), seven of which had been verified by carbohydrate analysis (10Perkins S.J. Smith K.F. Amatayakul S. Ashford D. Rademacher T.W. Dwek R.A. Lachmann P.J. Harrison R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 751-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Most of the sugars are present in the N-terminal domain and do not affect proteinase inhibition (11Coutinho M. Aulak K.S. Davis A.E. II I J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3648-3654PubMed Google Scholar, 12Bos I.G.A. Lubbers Y.T.P. Roem D. Abrahams J.P. Hack C.E. Eldering E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29463-29470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), but affinity to endotoxins and selectins depends on the N-glycans. The importance of C1-inh is underlined by its deficiency, resulting in hereditary angioedema (HAE) (13Bowen T. Cicardi M. Farkas H. Bork K. Kreuz W. Zingale L. Varga L. Martinez-Saguer I. Aygoören-Puörsuön E. Binkley K. Zuraw B. Davis A. II I Hebert J. Ritchie B. Burnham J. Castaldo A. Menendez A. Nagy I. Harmat G. Bucher C. Lacuesta G. Issekutz A. Warrington R. Yang W. Dean J.

Symptoms of HAE manifest themselves in recurrent tissue swelling, which could be lethal if it occurs in the upper airways. Replacement therapy using C1-inh isolated from human plasma was introduced over 25 years ago (14Gadek J.E. Hosea S.W. Gelfand J.A. Santaella M. Wickerhauser M. Triantaphyllopoulos D.C. Frank M.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1980; 302: 542-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Its potential as an anti-inflammatory drug was also apparent. Application of C1-inh was found to be beneficial in ischemia-reperfusion injury (organ transplant rejection, heart attack) and septic shock (15Caliezi C. Wuillemin W.A. Zeerleder S. Redondo M. Eisele B. Hack C.E. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 91-112PubMed Google Scholar). Recent advances of biotechnology led to the large scale production of recombinant C1-inh from the milk of transgenic rabbits (16van Doorn M.B.A. Burggraaf J. van Dam T. Eerenberg A. Levi M. Hack C.E. Schoemaker R.C. Cohen A.F. Nuijens J. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2005; 116: 876-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Activities of many serpins are modulated by ligand binding. The anti-complement activity of heparin, mediated by C1-inh, was recognized decades ago (17Caughman G.B. Boackle R.J. Vesely J. Mol. Immunol. 1982; 19: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), but the mechanism is still unclear (4Bos I.G.A. Hack C.E. Abrahams J.P. Immunobiology. 2002; 205: 518-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 18Bos I.G.A.C. C1-Inhibitor potentiation by glycosaminoglycans. 2003; (, CIP-Gegevens Koninklijke Bibliotheek, The Hague, Netherlands)Google Scholar). Heparin is a naturally occurring sulfated polysaccharide (glycosaminoglycan (GAG)). The widely used anticoagulant therapy is based on the prototype of GAG-protein interactions, where a heparin chain binds both the serpin antithrombin and the proteinase thrombin. Heparin works as a template; it speeds up the formation of the Michaelis complex and stabilizes it by bridging the two proteins (19Li W. Johnson D.J.D. Esmon C.T. Huntington J.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 857-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 20Dementiev A. Petitou M. Herbert J-M. Gettins P.G.W. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 863-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Allostery also plays an important role in the heparin activation of anti-thrombin (21Johnson D.J.D. Li W. Adams T.E. Huntington J.A. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2029-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and heparin cofactor II (22Baglin T.P. Carrell R.W. Church F.C. Esmon C.T. Huntington J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11079-11084Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). These mechanisms fail to explain the effect of GAGs on C1-inh. We determined the structure of N-terminally truncated human C1-inh to understand how heparin and related polyanions alter its activity. Protein Expression and Purification—The cDNA clone of human C1-inh (allele V458M) was kindly provided by Susan Clark Bock (9Bock S.C. Skriver K. Nielsen E. Thøgersen H-C. Wiman B. Donaldson V.H. Eddy R.L. Marrinan J. Radziejewska E. Huber R. Shows T.B. Magnusson S. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4292-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The EcoRI restriction site was eliminated from the gene. The construct of truncated recombinant C1-inh (rC1-inh) contained six histidines at the N terminus followed by residues Thr97–Ala478 (Fig. 1A). The DNA construct was ligated into pPic9K vector (Invitrogen) between SnaBI and EcoRI sites. The Pichia pastoris GS115 strain (Invitrogen) was transformed with the DraI-digested plasmid, and then His+ MutS clones were isolated. Expression was conducted in a fermentor with a 2-liter vessel (Biostat B; B. Braun). A 40-ml starter culture was grown for 2 days in yeast peptone dextrose medium (Invitrogen). The fermentor was loaded with a 1.5-liter medium of 1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) peptone, 1× yeast nitrogen base (Invitrogen), 0.1 m KH2PO4, 4% (v/v) glycerol and inoculated with the starter. After depletion of batch glycerol, the cells were fed with 50% (v/v) glycerol, and the culture was grown until the wet cell weight reached 200 g liter-1. Recombinant C1-inh production was induced with 25% (v/v) methanol and 40% (w/v) sorbitol for 2–3 days. The pH was kept at 6.0 with NH3, the temperature was kept at 25 °C, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.2 mm final concentration) was added twice daily during the induction period. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and EDTA were added to the clarified supernatant to a final concentration of 0.5 and 25 mm, respectively, and then stored at -70 °C until use. Nickel affinity purification of recombinant C1-inh was performed (Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow; Qiagen). Cation exchange chromatography followed (Source 15S column; GE Healthcare), using a 10-column volume 0–0.5 m NaCl gradient in the following buffer: 20 mm MOPS, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0. Active and latent rC1-inh forms were separated at this step. The purified proteins were deglycosylated at 4 °C using endoglycosidase H (New England Biolabs) for 1 week. The deglycosylated protein was purified again by cation exchange as above, followed by gel filtration (Sephadex 75 HiLoad 16/60; GE Healthcare). The purified recombinant C1-inh was concentrated to 10–14 mg ml-1. Protein concentration was estimated from the absorbance of the solution at 280 nm using the extinction coefficient of 0.64 ml mg-1 cm-1, calculated from the protein sequence using the Expasy ProtParam tool. Deglycosylation of Recombinant C1-inh—4.6 μg of glycosylated active recombinant C1-inh (in 10 μl) was used to demonstrate heterogeneity caused by N-glycans. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 1.5 h, with or without 100 units of endoglycosidase H. β-Mercaptoethanol reduced and nonreduced samples were run on 12.5% SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B). Activity Test of C1-inh Forms—The reactivity of different C1-inh forms was tested with target proteinase C1s and non-target proteinase trypsin. 0.4 μg of activated C1s (Calbiochem) in 10 μl was used throughout. Bovine pancreatic trypsin (T-1426; Sigma) was dissolved and dialyzed in 1 mm HCl, and then 0.2 μg (in 1 μl) was used in all reactions. Three forms of C1-inh were tested. 2.3 μg of lyophilized plasma C1-inh (Berinert P; ZLB Behring), 2.8 μg of active deglycosylated recombinant C1-inh, and 7.4 μg of latent deglycosylated recombinant C1-inh was made up to 5 μl with buffer containing 140 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, and used in a reaction. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and analyzed on 12.5% SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1C). The specific activity of recombinant C1-inh was probed with excess C1s under conditions identical to those described above. ∼9 μg of C1s was reacted with 0.31, 0.63, 1.25, and 2.5 μg of active deglycosylated recombinant C1-inh (in a 10-μl volume). Over 90% of the protein was reactive toward C1s, and ∼70% formed a covalent complex (Fig. S1). Thermal Stability Measurements of C1-inh Forms—Dilutions with 140 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, buffer were made to yield 0.1–0.2 mg ml-1 C1-inh solutions. Differential scanning calorimetry scans were recorded using VP-differential scanning calorimetry (MicroCal) in the range of 30–125 °C, at a rate of 1 °C min-1, with 15-min preincubation at 30 °C and a 2–4-s data accumulation time. Buffer was used as reference. Melting temperatures were read at peak maximas.

Crystals grew in condition 35 (Crystal Screen I; Hampton Research) within 2 weeks. The crystals were cryoprotected by soaking in reservoir solution containing 20% (v/v) glycerol. Collections of diffraction data were carried out at 100 K on beamline X11 of the EMBL outstation at DESY (Hamburg, Germany) (wave-length 0.8162 Å). The asymmetric unit contained one molecule. Data were processed using the XDS package (23Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3233) Google Scholar). The structure was solved by molecular replacement using MOLREP of the CCP4 package (24Project Collaborative Computational Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar). Molecular replacement using structures of individual serpins failed, so a superimposed structure ensemble of various serpins was used as a search model. The following structures were acquired from the Protein Data Bank, quoted with respective Protein Data Bank codes: 4CAA, 1QMB, 1E05, 1DVN, 1C8O, 1JTI, 1JJO, 1MTP, 1HLE, and 1JRR. Structurally nonconserved regions, N terminus, and the reactive center loop (RCL) were removed from the search model of molecular replacement using DeepView (25Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9590) Google Scholar). Refinement was carried out with the REFMAC5 program, using TLS refinement and restrained maximum likelihood refinement (26Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar). Manual model building was carried out using the program COOT (27Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23389) Google Scholar). Residues of the N and C terminus, three short disordered segments, and side chains of some surface residues were not built in the model due to a lack of electron density. The final model contains residues 101–102, 105–137, 142–293, and 296–476, one covalently bound saccharide, three glycerol, and 70 water molecules. 90.4 and 9.6% of the residues are in the most favored and additional favored regions of the Ramachandran plot, respectively.

All proteinases were truncated to the beginning of the activation peptide, so only the catalytic serine proteinase domains were retained. Electrostatics was calculated using APBS (37Baker N.A.

Blind Docking—The structure diagram and the released torsion angles of the docked heparin disaccharide are depicted in Fig. 5C, derived from protein-saccharide complex structures 1T8U and 1XMN. Residue pairs SGN2-IDS3 in Protein Data Bank entry 1T8U and SGN4-IDS5 of chain U in Protein Data Bank entry 1XMN were taken as models of the disaccharide in twist-boat and chair conformations, respectively. Initial calculations with both models yielded similar docked ensembles, so further calculations were carried out with saccharide rings in chair conformation. Calculations were carried out on our C1-inh crystal structure (Protein Data Bank code 2OAY). Active antithrombin both in heparin-bound (39Jin L. Abrahams J.P. Skinner R. Petitou M. Pike R.N. Carrell R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14683-14688Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) (1AZX) and -free conformations (1E04) were also used for method validation. The macromolecules were prealigned using AMoRe of the CCP4 suite. Structures were prepared for docking in AutoDockTools; polar hydrogen atoms were added to the structures, and Gasteiger and Kollman united atom charges were used for the ligand and protein atoms, respectively. First docking was carried out on the whole protein represented with coarse grid maps (100 × 96 × 86 grid points with 1.0-Å spacing). The best solution was used for further docking with fine grid maps (108 × 108 × 108 grid points with 0.375-Å spacing). AutoGrid and AutoDock were used for calculation of grid maps and docking, respectively (using the Lamarckian Genetic Algorithm) (40Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Halliday R.S. Huey R. Hart W.E. Belew R.K. Olson A.J. J. Comput. Chem. 1998; 19: 1639-1662Crossref Scopus (9210) Google Scholar). Docking was carried out with default parameters. The number of trials was set to 100, with an initial population of 250 individuals, 2 × 107 energy evaluations, and 27,000 generations. The resulting docked structures were clustered with 3- and 1-Å root mean square deviation tolerances for the first and second docking runs. Visualization—Figures were prepared using PyMOL (DeLano Scientific). Additional figures were produced with InkScape, CS ChemDraw Pro (CambridgeSoft), and Origin (MicroCal). Expression and Structure Determination—A C1-inh serpin domain construct (in which the first 96 amino acids of the wild-type protein were replaced with a His-tag) was engineered to reduce heterogeneity and to aid purification. This truncation removes the nonconserved part of C1-inh and leaves most of the biological activities essentially unchanged (11Coutinho M. Aulak K.S. Davis A.E. II I J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3648-3654PubMed Google Scholar, 12Bos I.G.A. Lubbers Y.T.P. Roem D. Abrahams J.P. Hack C.E. Eldering E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29463-29470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The truncated rC1-inh, expressed in P. pastoris, was visualized as a smear between 50 and 100 kDa on SDS-PAGE, since it was heterogeneously glycosylated (Fig. 1B). Purification yielded two forms; one formed a covalent complex with C1s, and the other did not (Fig. 1C). N-Glycans were removed enzymatically, resulting in a homogeneous protein migrating at ∼44 kDa. Differential scanning calorimetry measurement of the inactive form showed a melting temperature between that of the active and cleaved rC1-inh forms (Table 1). The noninhibitory form was crystallized, and a full data set was collected. The structure was determined using molecular replacement and refined to 2.35 Å resolution (Table 2). Overall Structure—Our structure represents the serpin domain (residues 113–478) and a small portion of the N-terminal domain (residues 97–112). The overall structure of rC1-inh resembles those of other serpins (1Gettins P.G.W. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4751-4803Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar), with highly conserved nine α-helices and three β-sheets present (Fig. 2A). The His-tag is not observed, and the remaining part of the unique N-terminal domain is poorly ordered. This small portion of the N-terminal domain is anchored with two nonconserved disulfide bonds along the D and E helices. Structural alignment with other serpin structures reveals major differences at helix D and the loop connecting it with the second strand of sheet A (s2A), where the helix is shortened to 2 turns and s2A is shortened by 2 residues (Fig. 2, A and B). The uncleaved RCL is incorporated into sheet A, forming s4A. Insertion occurred up to position P5, where P1-P1′ denotes the Arg444-Thr445 scissile bond (Fig. 3A). This classifies the crystallized form of rC1-inh as latent (41Mottonen J. Strand A. Symersky J. Sweet R.M. Danley D.E. Geoghegan K.F. Gerard R.D. Goldsmith E.J. Nature. 1992; 355: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). A well defined hydrogen bonding network and burial of reactive center residues explain the loss of inhibitory activity. A striking feature of our structure is that the C-terminal P′ part of the RCL forms the new seventh strand of sheet A, making it a fully anti-parallel β-sheet (Figs. 2A and 3A). This segment forms a flexible surface loop in all other known latent serpin structures (28Im H. Woo M-S. Hwang K.Y Yu M.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46347-46354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 41Mottonen J. Strand A. Symersky J. Sweet R.M. Danley D.E. Geoghegan K.F. Gerard R.D. Goldsmith E.J.

Structure. 1994; 2: 257-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Apart from backbone strand-strand interactions, hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Gln385 and Gln420 stabilize its conformation. The conformation of the nearby C-terminal tail (encompassing the last 6 residues of the protein) is also unique to rC1-inh. The conformation of this tail is conserved in known serpin structures (1Gettins P.G.W. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4751-4803Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar, 43Irving J.A. Pike R.N. Lesk A.M. Whisstock J.C. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1845-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), since the Cα positions of the highly conserved Pro391 of α1-proteinase inhibitor and equivalent prolines in other structures deviate no more than 3 Å (Fig. 3C). In other serpins, the C-terminal tail is placed to the side of strand s6A in sheet A. In contrast, this segment of rC1-inh is folded in a topologically unique way. It is on the other side of the RCL, and the conserved Pro476 is moved away by more than 10 Å (Fig. 3B) compared with the position found in other serpins (Fig. 3C). This conformational change can solely be attributed to a rigid body rotation of backbone around Tyr474, whose Ψ angle made an almost complete turn of ∼180°.FIGURE 3Novel interactions in latent rC1-inh structure. A, stereo view of sheet A of rC1-inh (cyan and magenta strands) and its extended hydrogen bond network stabilizing the entire RCL (magenta). B, stereo view of the C-terminal tail with electron density map contoured at the 1.0 σ level. The tail (green) differs not only in the position but also in the way it is folded around the RCL (magenta). C, stereo view of the C-terminal tail of latentα1-proteinase inhibitor. Orientation and coloring is the same as in B, to make the images comparable. Note that the conserved position of Pro391 is occupied with P7′-P8′ RCL residues in rC1-inh instead of the equivalent Pro476. D, schematic drawing of the hypothetical mechanism of active-latent transition. Latent serpins have their sheet A extended, where the RCL (magenta) inserts in sheet A without RCL cleavage. Strands of sheet C (depicted here as the two-stranded sheet) tilt to allow the RCL to pass, deduced from latent structures known so far (top row). Sheet A is seven-stranded in rC1-inh, since the entire RCL is inserted, forming two new strands (bottom row). This imposes a steric clash with the conserved C terminus (green) if left unaltered.

Defects in A-type lamins reduce nuclear structural integrity and affect transcriptional regulation, but few data exist on the biological role of B-type lamins. To assess the functional importance of lamin B1, we examined nuclear dynamics in fibroblasts from Lmnb1Δ/Δ and wild-type littermate embryos by time-lapse videomicroscopy. Here, we report that Lmnb1Δ/Δ cells displayed striking nuclear rotation, with ∼90% of Lmnb1Δ/Δ nuclei rotating at least 90° during an 8-h period. The rotation involved the nuclear interior as well as the nuclear envelope. The rotation of nuclei required an intact cytoskeletal network and was eliminated by expressing lamin B1 in cells. Nuclear rotation could also be abolished by expressing larger nesprin isoforms with long spectrin repeats. These findings demonstrate that lamin B1 serves a fundamental role within the nuclear envelope: anchoring the nucleus to the cytoskeleton.

The mechanism by which these ubiquitously expressed proteins cause such diverse phenotypes is unclear. This is not particularly surprising, though, because the functions of the nuclear lamins themselves are currently incompletely understood. Lamins are the principal components of the nuclear lamina, an intermediate filament meshwork that lines the inner nuclear membrane (8Aebi U. Cohn J. Buhle L. Gerace L. Nature. 1986; 323: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar, 9Burke B. Stewart C.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 575-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Lamins are associated with chromatin, other integral proteins of the inner nuclear membrane, inner portions of the nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), 2The abbreviations used are: NPC, nuclear pore complex; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblast; LBR, lamin B receptor; KASH, Klarsicht/ANC-1/Syne-1 homology; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; RFP, red fluorescent protein; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; Az, sodium azide; DOG, 2-deoxyglucose; Bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)-propane-1,3-diol. and several transcription factors such as SREBP1, retinoblastoma protein, and MOK (10Goldman R.D. Gruenbaum Y. Moir R.D. Shumaker D.K. Spann T.P. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 533-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Thus, lamins are critical for the structural integrity of the nucleus and also play a role in DNA replication, chromatin organization, and transcriptional regulation (11Hutchison C.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 848-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, the major A-type lamins, lamins A and C, are alternatively spliced products of LMNA, whereas the major B-type lamins, lamin B1 and lamin B2, are encoded by two distinct genes, LMNB1 and LMNB2, respectively (12Stuurman N. Heins S. Aebi U. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 122: 42-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Although the A- and B-type lamins share a similar structure, they differ in their behavior during cell division and their patterns of expression. B-type lamins are found in all cell types and are expressed throughout development, whereas A-type lamins are not present in early embryos (13Broers J.L. Machiels B.M. Kuijpers H.J. Smedts F. van den Kieboom R. Raymond Y. Ramaekers F.C. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 107: 505-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Within the nucleus, lamin B1 binds directly to chromatin and histones (14Taniura H. Glass C. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and interacts with several chromatin-binding inner nuclear membrane proteins (e.g. lamina-associated proteins, lamin B receptor (LBR), and the nuclear pore protein nucleoporin 153) (15Smythe C. Jenkins H.E. Hutchison C.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3918-3931Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Following mitosis, B-type lamins assemble first into the nuclear lamina, followed by lamin A, and subsequently by lamin C (16Hutchison C.J. Alvarez-Reyes M. Vaughan O.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 9-19Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Few data exist on the biological role of the B-type lamins. B-type lamins may have a direct role in DNA synthesis (16Hutchison C.J. Alvarez-Reyes M. Vaughan O.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 9-19Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and silencing of lamin B by siRNA causes cell death in human cells and in Caenorhabditis elegans (17Liu J. Ben-Shahar T.R. Riemer D. Treinin M. Spann P. Weber K. Fire A. Gruenbaum Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3937-3947Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 18Harborth J. Elbashir S.M. Bechert K. Tuschl T. Weber K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4557-4565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For these reasons, B-type lamins are generally assumed to be essential. Mice deficient in lamin B1 (Lmnb1Δ/Δ), which were created with a gene-trap embryonic stem cell line, die in the perinatal period with defects in lung and bone (19Vergnes L. Peterfy M. Bergo M.O. Young S.G. Reue K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10428-10433Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Lmnb1Δ/Δ embryonic fibroblasts display nuclear shape abnormalities, chromosomal abnormalities, and impaired differentiation into adipocytes (19Vergnes L. Peterfy M. Bergo M.O. Young S.G. Reue K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10428-10433Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). In humans, duplication of LMNB1 causes autosomal dominant leukodystrophy (20Padiath Q.S. Saigoh K. Schiffmann R. Asahara H. Yamada T. Koeppen A. Hogan K. Ptacek L.J. Fu Y.H. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 1114-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). To further elucidate the function of lamin B1, we decided to examine nuclear shape and dynamics in fibroblasts from Lmnb1Δ/Δ and wild-type embryos by quantitative time-lapse videomicroscopy. We made a stunning observation: nuclei spin in the absence of lamin B1, and we show that this nuclear rotation could be rescued by transfection with a GFP-lamin B1 fusion protein. Using fluorescence labeling of discrete nuclear envelope components, we found that the nuclear rotation includes rotational movement of chromatin, the nuclear lamina, the inner nuclear membrane, NPC proteins, as well as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) immediately adjacent to the nucleus, but not the extended ER or the surrounding cytoskeleton. Furthermore, the nuclear rotation was energy-dependent, required an intact cytoskeleton, and the rotation could be reduced by transfection of Lmnb1Δ/Δ cells with larger nesprin isoforms. These data suggest a critical role for lamin B1 as a molecular anchor at the nuclear-cytoplasm interface, specifically in facilitating physical coupling between the outer nuclear membrane and the surrounding cytoskeleton. Cell Culture and Reagents—Wild-type and Lmnb1-deficient (Lmnb1+/+ and Lmnb1Δ/Δ, respectively) mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) were derived from Lmnb1Δ/Δ mouse embryos and wild-type littermates (19Vergnes L. Peterfy M. Bergo M.O. Young S.G. Reue K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10428-10433Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Lmna+/+ and Lmna-/- MEFs were obtained from Dr. Colin Stewart (21Sullivan T. Escalante-Alcalde D. Bhatt H. Anver M. Bhat N. Nagashima K. Stewart C.L. Burke B. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 913-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). All cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C. To study the role of the cytoskeleton in nuclear dynamics, cells were treated with media containing either 200 nm taxol, 300 nm nocodazole, or 200 nm cytochalasin D (all from Sigma) before starting time-lapse imaging experiments. For recovery studies, drugs were removed and replaced with fresh media before the second time-lapse experiment. In all cases, fluorescence immunohistochemistry confirmed that each drug was disrupting its intended target cytoskeletal component, while leaving other structures intact. For ATP inhibitor studies, subconfluent Lmnb1Δ/Δ MEFs were treated with media containing 5 mm sodium azide (Az) and 1 mm 2-deoxyglucose (DOG), both from Sigma, before starting the time-lapse imaging experiment. Cell nuclei were labeled with Hoechst 33342; the endoplasmic reticulum was stained with ER-Tracker Blue-White DPX; and mitochondria were stained with MitoTracker Green FM (all from Molecular Probes). Plasmid Construct and Transfection—The pGFP-Lmnb1 construct was generated by inserting the human lamin B1 sequence into the multiple cloning site of the pEGFPC1 vector (Clontech), generating lamin B1 fused to the carboxyl terminus of EGFP. The nesprin constructs were generated by cloning human cDNAs for nespirn-1α,-2α, and -2β into pEGFPC1 vectors. Nesprin-1αKASH (amino acids: nespirn-1α-(918-982)) or 2αKASH (amino acids: nespirn-2α-(483-542)) contain only the KASH domain sequences for each isoform. All nesprins are fused to the carboxyl terminus of EGFP. The pGFP-emerin plasmid was a gift from Dr. Chris Hutchison of University of Durham; the pRFP-Lmna and pLBR-GFP plasmids were provided by Dr. Howard Worman of Columbia University; and the pPOM121-GFP plasmid was provided by Dr. Brian Burke of the University of Florida. GFP-actin and GFP-tubulin were from Dr. Frank Gertler of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. All constructs contain full-length human proteins, which, except for LBR and POM121, are placed at the carboxyl terminus of fluorescence tags. Transfection was conducted with GeneJammer Transfection Reagent (Stratagene) at a ratio of 3 μl to 1 μg of DNA. Time-lapse Imaging and Fluorescent Confocal Microscopy—Lmnb1+/+, Lmnb1Δ/Δ, and Lmna-/- MEFs were grown to subconfluent density in 35-mm polystyrene cell culture dishes (Corning), sealed with parafilm, and equilibrated to room temperature. Images of cells were acquired automatically at either 20× or 60× magnification on an Olympus IX-70 microscope with a digital charge-coupled device camera (CoolSNAP HQ, Roper Scientific) for 100 frames at 5-min intervals (corresponding to 8 h and 20 min). Phase contrast images alone were acquired with ImagePro image acquisition software (Media Cybernetics). Consecutive phase contrast and fluorescent images were acquired with an automated, motorized shutter system (Prior ProScan II) controlled by IPLab version 3.7 (Scanalytics) software. Fluorescence images were processed with Deconvolution 7.0 (Vaytech Image). For confocal microscopy, cells were plated on 35-mm glass-bottom culture dishes (MatTek) and imaged with a Plan-Apochromat 63×/1.4 oil differential interference contrast oil-immersion objective on a Zeiss Axiovert 100M microscope. Laser scanning microscopy was done with an argon laser module. Photobleaching and image acquisition were controlled with the Zeiss LSM510 software. Image Acquisition and Manipulation—Phase contrast and fluorescence time-lapse images and confocal microscopy were carried out as described above. Time-lapse images were taken with an Olympus LCPlanF 20× phase contrast objective (numerical aperture, 0.40). Confocal images were acquired with a Plan-Apochromat 63× oil immersion objective (numerical aperture, 1.4). All imaging experiments were carried out at room temperature, and cells were maintained in complete culture media. Videos of time-lapse images were generated with MATLAB, and fluorescence grayscale images from IPLab were colorized in MATLAB for the appropriate fluorochromes (green for GFP, and red for RFP). Photographic films from Western blot studies were digitized on an Epson Perfection 2450 scanner with linear intensity settings. Digital images were processed in Adobe Photoshop (version 6.0) by adjusting the linear image intensity display range. Nuclear Movement Analysis—Customized MATLAB algorithms were used to track the position of three to six distinct nucleoli within each nucleus as described previously (22Lammerding J. Hsiao J. Schulze P.C. Kozlov S. Stewart C.L. Lee R.T. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 781-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). For each frame, the centroid of selected nucleoli was calculated, and the linear conformal image transformation was computed that best mapped the current centroid positions to the original positions while minimizing the least-square error. The linear conformal transformations can account for a combination of translation, rotation, and scaling, and also preserve the relative position of objects to each other. The deviation from the best fit (i.e. the error between the least-square fit transformation and the actual nucleoli positions) was used as a measure of nuclear deformation, as it describes the extent of nuclear deformation from its initial shape independent of absolute nuclear movement or uniform changes in size. Nuclei of each cell type were analyzed for the time-averaged rotational movement (in degree), translational movement (in microns), and nuclear shape deformation (in microns) as well as normalized nuclear size, or the scaling factor. Time-lapse videos were also qualitatively scored by an observer blinded to genotype, as either rotating or not rotating. A rotating nucleus was defined as rotating at least 90° in either direction within the 8-h, 20-min time frame. Western Analysis—Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer with 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenyl-methylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) at 1:1000 dilution. Equal amounts of protein in 12 μl of sample buffer were electrophoresed on 10% Bis-Tris polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen), and then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Blots were probed with either primary rabbit polyclonal antibody against human lamin B1 (sc20682, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:500 dilution), goat polyclonal antibody against human lamin A/C (sc6215, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:500 dilution), rabbit polyclonal antibody against human emerin (Abcam, 1:3000 dilution), goat polyclonal horseradish peroxidase-conjugate antibody against GFP (Abcam, 1:500 dilution), or rabbit anti-actin antibody (Sigma, 1:5000 dilution), followed by chemiluminescence detection (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were grown on glass slides, transfected with GFP constructs of nesprin isoforms, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, 48 h after the transfection. Cells were then permeabilized for 10 min with either 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline, or 0.003% digitonin (Sigma) in water (in experiments involving selective permeabilization of the plasma membrane only). The cells were then blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin and labeled with appropriate primary and secondary antibodies. Fluorescence images were acquired at 20× magnification using an Olympus IX-70 microscope with a digital charge-coupled device camera (CoolSNAP HQ, Roper Scientific) driven by IPLab version 3.7 (Scanalytics) software. Cells were probed with either goat polyclonal antibody against human lamin A/C (sc6215, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by Alexa Fluor 568 (red) rabbit anti-goat IgG (A11079, Invitrogen) or rabbit polyclonal antibody against GFP (ab6556, Abcam) followed by Alexa Fluor 350 (blue) goat anti-rabbit IgG (A11046, Invitrogen). All antibodies were used at 1:200 dilution in 1% bovine serum albumin. Statistical Analysis—All experiments were performed at least three independent times. Statistical analyses were performed with the PRISM 3.0 and INSTAT (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). The unpaired Student's t test (allowing for different variance) was used to analyze if the means of two data groups were statistically different. For all experiments, a two-tailed p value of <0.05 was considered significant. All data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Lmnb1Δ/Δ Nuclei Spin—To assess the functional importance of lamin B1, we examined nuclear dynamics in fibroblasts derived from littermate Lmnb1Δ/Δ and wild-type mouse embryos with time-lapse videomicroscopy. Representative videos of wild-type, Lmnb1Δ/Δ, and lamin A/C-null (Lmna-/-) cells are included in Video 1 (supplemental material). Remarkably, a high percentage of Lmnb1Δ/Δ nuclei displayed rotational movement around an axis perpendicular to the image plane (i.e. the nuclei rotated parallel to the plane of the cell substrate). Rotation in an orthogonal axis was never observed. The rotational motion was intermittent, and the degree and speed of rotation varied; the direction of spinning was random. Occasionally, nuclei underwent rapid rotation and turned several times before stopping. Fig. 1A shows a series of 14 images (corresponding to 65 min) capturing one nucleus with rapid counterclockwise rotation of up to 145°. As demonstrated in Video 1, the positions of nucleoli relative to each other did not change in the rotating nuclei, despite the striking rotation. Also, despite the spinning, Lmnb1Δ/Δ nuclei maintained a circular shape and appeared normally positioned within the cell, suggesting that the entire nucleus rotates as a solid body. In contrast, Lmna-/- nuclei displayed dynamic nuclear deformation but little rotational movement; wild-type cells displayed stable nuclear shape and only minimal nuclear rotation. To quantify the frequency of nuclear rotation, we counted the fraction of nuclei that rotated at least 90° during an 8-h observation period. The majority (90 ± 2.7%) of Lmnb1Δ/Δ cells met this criterion, whereas wild-type and Lmna-/- cells rarely displayed any nuclear rotation (p < 0.005) (Fig. 1B). Subsequently, we analyzed nuclear dynamics in more detail (e.g. nuclear rotation, translation, and deformation) based on the trajectories of selected nucleoli within each nucleus. We calculated the incremental rotation at each time point and determined the absolute angles of nuclear rotation at the end of each time-lapse period for all of the nuclei observed. On average, Lmnb1Δ/Δ nuclei rotated 90.0 ± 20.8° in either direction, with one nucleus turning as much as 593° (i.e. more than 1.5 full turns) (Fig. 1C). Despite the intermittent nature of nuclear rotation, the time-averaged angle of rotation for Lmnb1Δ/Δ nuclei was larger than in wild-type and Lmna-/- nuclei. Both Lmnb1Δ/Δ and Lmna-/- cells had slightly increased nuclear translational motion (Fig. 1D), predominantly caused by increased cell movement. However, because Lmna-/- and Lmnb1Δ/Δ cells did not differ statistically in their translational movement, this effect appears to be unrelated to nuclear rotational movement, which was unique to Lmnb1Δ/Δ cells. Unlike Lmna-/- cells, Lmnb1Δ/Δ cells did not show increased time-averaged nuclear deformation compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 1E), and nuclear fragility was normal (Fig. S1, supplemental material). Rotation of Lmnb1Δ/Δ Nuclei Is Attenuated by the Expression of a GFP-lamin B1 Fusion Protein—To confirm that nuclear spinning was attributable to the loss of wild-type lamin B1, we analyzed nuclear movement in Lmnb1Δ/Δ cells transfected with a GFP-lamin B1 fusion construct. Experiments were done within 48 h post-transfection, enough time for mitosis and nuclear envelope reformation to occur in most cells. Nuclei expressing GFP-lamin B1 exhibited reduced nuclear rotation compared with nontransfected Lmnb1Δ/Δ controls (45% reduction, p = 0.02), but expression of a GFP-emerin fusion construct did not alter nuclear rotation (Fig. 1F) and failed to restore wild-type behavior. Similarly, transfection with a red fluorescent protein-lamin A fusion protein (RFP-lamin A) did not prevent nuclear rotation (not shown). Average translational movement was not affected by any of the constructs. Western analysis confirmed the presence of both GFP-lamin B1 and GFP-emerin 1 day after transfection (Fig. 1G). Expression of GFP-lamin B1, however, did not completely restore the wild-type phenotype (45% reduction in nuclear rotation), possibly due to variations in transfection efficiency or expression of GFP-lamin B1. These data indicate that rotation in Lmnb1Δ/Δ nuclei is due to the loss of functional lamin B1. Nuclear Rotation in Lmnb1Δ/Δ Cells Includes Chromatin and the Nuclear Envelope—Although time-lapse analysis of phase-contrast images is well suited to quantify the extent of nuclear rotation based on nucleoli movement, it is insufficient to determine if the rotational movement encompasses the entire nuclear interior and the nuclear envelope. Therefore, we selectively labeled chromatin, the nuclear lamina, the inner nuclear membrane, and NPCs with fluorescent probes and then analyzed, by time-lapse videomicroscopy, which nuclear structures participated in the nuclear rotation in Lmnb1Δ/Δ fibroblasts. Staining cells with Hoechst 33342, a DNA minor groove-binding fluorescent dye, demonstrated that the entire chromatin contents were involved in the nuclear rotation (Fig. 2A and Video 2). This finding was in keeping with our observation that nucleoli retained their relative position to each other. Because lamins can directly bind to DNA and thus attach the nuclear lamina to chromatin (14Taniura H. Glass C. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), we investigated whether the nuclear lamina also rotated in the Lmnb1Δ/Δ fibroblasts. Time-lapse microscopy of cells expressing RFP-lamin A revealed distinct rotation of the nuclear lamina (Video 3). These results were further confirmed by time lapse-analysis of partially photobleached nuclei in RFP-lamin A-labeled Lmnb1Δ/Δ cells. In one example, images taken immediately after photobleaching showed a darkened band through the fluorescent nuclear lamina (Fig. 2F), which turned ∼50° clockwise during the subsequent 78-min period of time-lapse confocal laser scanning microscopy (see also Video 7, supplemental material). Subsequently, we tracked rotation of the inner nuclear membrane by fluorescent time-lapse videomicroscopy in cells transfected with GFP-tagged lamin B receptor (LBR-GFP) or emerin (GFP-emerin). LBR and emerin reside at the inner nuclear membrane (23Georgatos S.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2989-2994Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and therefore can serve as an indicator for inner nuclear membrane movement. We found that both LBR, which interacts with lamin B1, and emerin, which binds to lamin A, participated in the nuclear rotation in Lmnb1Δ/Δ cells (Fig. 2C and 3A). Rotation of the inner nuclear membrane was clearly demonstrated by the movement of the fluorescent nuclear periphery in the supplemental Videos 4 and 8. Importantly, the inner nuclear membrane (marked by GFP-emerin) rotation occurred in unison with the rotation of the nuclear interior, as indicated by the numbered nucleoli in the phase-contrast images (Fig. 3A). We also attempted photo-bleaching studies on GFP-emerin- and LBR-GFP-labeled nuclei, but the high diffusional mobility of these inner nuclear membrane proteins and the resulting rapid fluorescence recovery (<10 min) did not allow long term observations of the photobleached sections. Lamin B1 can bind to NPC proteins such as nucleoporin 153 (15Smythe C. Jenkins H.E. Hutchison C.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3918-3931Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), so that loss of lamin B1 could potentially allow the inner nucleus to rotate relative to the nuclear pores and the outer nuclear envelope. To address this possibility, we followed the movement of GFP-fused nuclear pore complex protein POM121 in Lmnb1Δ/Δ cells with inverse fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. POM121 is a pore complex protein that serves to anchor NPCs to the nuclear membrane (24Soderqvist H. Imreh G. Kihlmark M. Linnman C. Ringertz N. Hallberg E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 808-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar); in these experiments, the entire nuclear fluorescence is extensively photobleached except for a small region of the nuclear envelope (25Rabut G. Doye V. Ellenberg J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1114-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), so that only POM121-GFP stably incorporated into NPC within that region remain fluorescent while eliminating fluorescence from soluble and excess GFP-tagged proteins that can diffuse freely within the nuclear membrane. We tracked nuclear movement up to 1 h after photobleaching during which time fluorescence recovery was not observed, and incorporation of newly produced POM121-GFP occurred only very slowly. Video 5 (Fig. 2D) shows distinct rotational movement of a small section of fluorescently labeled NPCs. The lack of quick fluorescence recovery confirms stable incorporation into NPCs and correlates well with previous reports of slow turnover (26Daigle N. Beaudouin J. Hartnell L. Imreh G. Hallberg E. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Ellenberg J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) and low dissociation rates of GFP-tagged POM121 following inverse fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (25Rabut G. Doye V. Ellenberg J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1114-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The clockwise directional turning of fluorescent NPCs in Video 5, with fluorescence extension at one end while retracting at the other end, suggests that nuclear membrane movement is due to rotation and not membrane diffusion. An additional video of a nucleus expressing POM121-GFP, in which a distinct fluorescent bleb on the nuclear periphery revealed rotational movement of NPCs, is included in the supplemental materials (Video 13). To further confirm that the outer nuclear membrane, like the NPCs and the inner nuclear membrane, also turn during nuclear rotation, we followed the movement of a GFP-fused nesprin isoform, nesprin-2α, as an outer nuclear membrane marker (Fig. 2E and Video 6). Nesprin-2 isoforms are present at the outer nuclear membrane (27Zhang Q. Ragnauth C.D. Skepper J.N. Worth N.F. Warren D.T. Roberts R.G. Weissberg P.L. Ellis J.A. Shanahan C.M. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 673-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), and we showed independently that expression of GFP-nesprin-2α does not interfere with nuclear rotation in Lmnb1Δ/Δ cells (see Fig. 5A). Following time-lapse image analysis, rotation of the outer nuclear membrane was clearly demonstrated by the movement of GFP-nesprin-2α (Video 6). Because the outer nuclear membrane is continuous with the ER, we monitored ER movement in cells labeled with ER-Tracker (Molecular Probes). These experiments revealed that only the ER immediately surrounding the nucleus displayed some rotational movement along with the nucleus, particularly at the start of rotation, but that the majority of the ER remained stationary throughout the rotation, suggesting that the lipid membranes can flow sufficiently on the slow experimental time scales (Fig. 3B and Video 9). The Nucleus Rotates Relative to the Stationary Cytoskeleton—To address the possibility that nuclear rotation occurred as part of overall cellular and cytoskeletal movement, we performed time-"

Isopentenyl diphosphate in turn is the precursor of vital isoprenoids, such as steroid hormones, carotenoids, cholesterol, and ubiquinone (4Sacchettini J.C. Poulter C.D. Science. 1997; 277: 1788-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes and Archaea (5Boucher Y. Doolittle W.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 703-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) isopentenyl diphosphate is instead formed through the mevalonate pathway (6Spurgeon S.L. Porter J.W. Porter J.W. Spurgeon S.L. Biosynthesis of isoprenoid Compounds. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1981: 1-46Google Scholar) starting from acetyl-CoA. The fact that humans use a different route from plants, protozoa, and many bacteria for the formation of isopentenyl diphosphate combined with the essentiality of isoprenoids makes all the enzymes within the non-mevalonate pathway interesting as potential targets for drugs and herbicides.Tuberculosis is one of the most serious diseases of our times. According to the World Health Organization, the causative bacterium, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, currently infects one-third of the world population, resulting in two million deaths annually. The increased prevalence of drug-resistant and multidrug-resistant strains together with the lethal combination that tuberculosis and AIDS represents, makes the need for new and better drugs urgent. In the search for new potential drug targets a number of aspects have to be considered. For instance, the target enzyme should perform a reaction vital for the bacteria, and if possible it should not have any human homologues. All enzymes within the non-mevalonate pathway fulfill these and other requirements and are, therefore, potential drug targets in M. tuberculosis.1-Deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR, 2The abbreviations used are: DXR, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase; DXP, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate; EcDXR, DXR from E. coli; F, fosmidomycin; M, Mn2+; MEP, 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate; MD, molecular dynamics; MtDXR, DXR from M. tuberculosis; N, NADPH; S, sulfate; ESRF, European Synchrotron Radiation Facility; Bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; PDB, Protein Data Bank. 2The abbreviations used are: DXR, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase; DXP, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate; EcDXR, DXR from E. coli; F, fosmidomycin; M, Mn2+; MEP, 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate; MD, molecular dynamics; MtDXR, DXR from M. tuberculosis; N, NADPH; S, sulfate; ESRF, European Synchrotron Radiation Facility; Bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; PDB, Protein Data Bank. also referred to as IspC; EC 1.1.1.267) catalyzes the NADPH-dependent rearrangement and reduction of 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP) to form 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) as the second step in the non-mevalonate pathway.

The cells were harvested and washed with 1× SSPE buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA), then stored at -20 °C.Purification followed the previous protocol (16Henriksson L.M. Björkelid C. Mowbray S.L. Unge T. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. After purification on a nickel-NTA column (Qiagen), the buffer was replaced on a PD10 column (GE Healthcare) with one containing 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, final pH 7.5. The protein was further purified by size exclusion chromatography on a HiLoad™ 16/60 Superdex™ 200 column (Amersham Biosciences) developed with the same buffer.The pooled fractions were concentrated to 4.3 mg/ml, and the glycerol concentration was at the same time lowered to 2%. The material was more than 98% pure as deduced from SDS/PAGE analysis (PhastSystem™, Amersham Biosciences). The yield of pure protein was 1.4 mg/liter culture for MtDXR and 1.7 mg/liter culture for MtDXRNQ.Inhibition Assay—DXP and fosmidomycin were generously provided by AstraZeneca India Pvt. Ltd. The inhibitory potential of fosmidomycin was evaluated in a spectrophotometric assay (7Takahashi S. Kuzuyama T. Watanabe H. Seto H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9879-9884Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 25Kuzuyama T. Takahashi S. Watanabe H. Seto H. Tetrahedron Lett. 1998; 39: 4509-4512Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar) in which the NADPH-dependent rearrangement and reduction of DXP to form MEP, catalyzed by MtDXR, was monitored at 340 nm using the absorption of NADPH (∊340 nm = 6220 m-1 cm-1). Each assay contained 350 μl of reaction buffer (129 mm NaCl, 2.9 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5.7% Me2SO, 2.1 mm MnCl2, and 64 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5), 50 μl of 3.85 μm MtDXR (in 100 mm NaCl, 0.01% Brij-35, and 50 mm HEPES-NaOH pH 7.5), 50 μl of 1.1 mm NADPH (in distilled H2O), 50 μl of 2.2 mm DXP (in distilled H2O), and 50 μl of fosmidomycin (in distilled H2O).One measurement was made in the absence of fosmidomycin together with six measurements with final fosmidomycin concentrations ranging between 25 and 200 nm. The decrease in absorbance at 340 nm was followed at 22 °C (DU® 640 spectrophotometer, Beckman) with time points every 5 s during a 3-min period. The slope of the linear phase (25-125 s) of each reaction was used in calculating the initial velocity (Fig. 1). The velocities were plotted against the corresponding fosmidomycin concentrations. A line was fitted to the points in the approximately linear region of the curve (inset in Fig. 1), and the equation so generated was used to estimate the IC50 value of fosmidomycin.Crystallization—MtDXR was co-crystallized with fosmidomycin using vapor diffusion. The sitting drop contained 0.9 μl of protein solution (3.3 mg/ml MtDXR in the buffer used during concentration, plus 10 mm fosmidomycin, 3 mm NADPH, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm dithiothreitol) and 0.9 μl of reservoir solution (0.2 m AmSO4, 25% polyethylene glycol 3350, and 0.1 m Bis-Tris, final pH 5.7) at 22 °C. Needle-like crystals appeared within a few days. Crystallization of both MtDXR and MtDXRNQ was then optimized with the aid of seeding in a batch experiment. The 4-μl sitting drops consisted of 2 μl of protein solution (3.3 mg/ml MtDXR or MtDXRNQ in the buffer used in the concentration with the addition of 0.1 mm EDTA and 10 mm dithiothreitol) and 2 μl of crystallization buffer (0.2 m AmSO4, 25% polyethylene glycol 3350, and 0.1 m Bis-Tris, final pH 5.7). The reservoir solution consisted of 0.1 m AmSO4, 12.5% polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.05 m Bis-Tris, 75 mm NaCl, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, final pH 5.9.MtDXR was co-crystallized with ligands in the combinations: DXP and MnSO4; DXP and NADPH; DXP, MnSO4 and NADPH; fosmidomycin and NADPH; fosmidomycin, MnSO4, and NADPH. The mutant MtDXRNQ was crystallized without ligands as well as in the following combinations: DXP, MnSO4, and NADPH; fosmidomycin and NADPH. The following concentrations of the ligands were added to the protein solution in co-crystallization experiments: 20 mm DXP, 10 mm fosmidomycin, 12 mm MnSO4, and 3 mm NADPH. Needle-like crystals appeared within a few days and grew to average dimensions of 0.2 × 0.05 × 0.02 mm in 2 weeks. Before the crystals were flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen, they were transferred to a drop of cryo solution containing 0.1 m AmSO4, 13% polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.06 m Bis-Tris, 75 mm NaCl, 25% glycerol, final pH 5.7. Depending on which ligands were used for co-crystallization, the following concentrations of the ligands were also present in the cryo solution: 10 mm DXP, 10 mm fosmidomycin, 12 mm MnSO4, and 3 mm NADPH.Data Collection, Structure Determination, Refinement, and Analysis—X-ray data were collected under cryo conditions at various beamlines at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble, France, and at MAX-lab in Lund, Sweden (Table 1).

https://openalex.org/W2029155774,"Fifty percent of lung adenocarcinomas harbor somatic mutations in six genes that encode proteins in the EGFR signaling pathway, i.e., EGFR, HER2/ERBB2, HER4/ERBB4, PIK3CA, BRAF, and KRAS. We performed mutational profiling of a large cohort of lung adenocarcinomas to uncover other potential somatic mutations in genes of this signaling pathway that could contribute to lung tumorigenesis.We analyzed genomic DNA from a total of 261 resected, clinically annotated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) specimens. The coding sequences of 39 genes were screened for somatic mutations via high-throughput dideoxynucleotide sequencing of PCR-amplified gene products. Mutations were considered to be somatic only if they were found in an independent tumor-derived PCR product but not in matched normal tissue. Sequencing of 9MB of tumor sequence identified 239 putative genetic variants. We further examined 22 variants found in RAS family genes and 135 variants localized to exons encoding the kinase domain of respective proteins. We identified a total of 37 non-synonymous somatic mutations; 36 were found collectively in EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA. One somatic mutation was a previously unreported mutation in the kinase domain (exon 16) of FGFR4 (Glu681Lys), identified in 1 of 158 tumors. The FGFR4 mutation is analogous to a reported tumor-specific somatic mutation in ERBB2 and is located in the same exon as a previously reported kinase domain mutation in FGFR4 (Pro712Thr) in a lung adenocarcinoma cell line.This study is one of the first comprehensive mutational analyses of major genes in a specific signaling pathway in a sizeable cohort of lung adenocarcinomas. Our results suggest the majority of gain-of-function mutations within kinase genes in the EGFR signaling pathway have already been identified. Our findings also implicate FGFR4 in the pathogenesis of a subset of lung adenocarcinomas."
https://openalex.org/W2142066514,"To perform their multiple functions, cilia and flagella are precisely positioned at the cell surface by mechanisms that remain poorly understood. The protist Trypanosoma brucei possesses a single flagellum that adheres to the cell body where a specific cytoskeletal structure is localised, the flagellum attachment zone (FAZ). Trypanosomes build a new flagellum whose distal tip is connected to the side of the old flagellum by a discrete structure, the flagella connector. During this process, the basal body of the new flagellum migrates towards the posterior end of the cell. We show that separate inhibition of flagellum assembly, base-to-tip motility or flagella connection leads to reduced basal body migration, demonstrating that the flagellum contributes to its own positioning. We propose a model where pressure applied by movements of the growing new flagellum on the flagella connector leads to a reacting force that in turn contributes to migration of the basal body at the proximal end of the flagellum."

Here we investigated whether the lipolytic actions of the human immunodeficiency virus protease inhibitor, nelfinavir, are mediated by decreased perilipin protein content and studied the mechanisms by which it occurs. Time course analysis revealed that the decrease in perilipin protein content preceded the increase in lipolysis. A causative relationship was suggested by demonstrating that nelfinavir potently increased lipolysis in adipocytes derived from mouse embryonal fibroblasts expressing perilipin but not in mouse embryonal fibroblast adipocytes devoid of perilipin and that adenoviral mediated overexpression of perilipin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes blocked the lipolytic actions of nelfinavir. Nelfinavir did not alter mRNA content of perilipin but rather decreased perilipin proteins t½ from >70 to 12 h. Protein degradation of perilipin in both control and nelfinavir-treated adipocytes could be prevented by inhibiting lysosomal proteolysis using leupeptin or NH4Cl but not by the proteasome inhibitor MG-132.

In studies where perilipin protein expression was examined in isolated adipocytes, perilipin was found to be decreased in obese individuals, suggesting a mechanism for the elevated levels of circulating fatty acids typically observed in obesity (16Kern P.A.

Intriguingly, protein expression of perilipin does not always correlate with the mRNA level (17Wang Y. Sullivan S. Trujillo M. Lee M.J. Schneider S.H. Brolin R.E. Kang Y.H. Werber Y. Greenberg A.S.

An enhanced rate of lipolysis is likely a common metabolic side effect of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART). 2The abbreviations used are: HAART, highly active anti-retroviral therapy; MEF, mouse embryonal fibroblast; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; FFA, free fatty acid(s); ADRP, adipocyte differentiation-related protein; HSL, hormone-sensitive lipase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CHX, cycloheximide.2The abbreviations used are: HAART, highly active anti-retroviral therapy; MEF, mouse embryonal fibroblast; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; FFA, free fatty acid(s); ADRP, adipocyte differentiation-related protein; HSL, hormone-sensitive lipase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CHX, cycloheximide. Patients receiving HAART develop a dyslipidemia characterized by enhanced lipid mobilization and elevated levels of circulating free fatty acids (FFA) (20van der Valk M. Bisschop P.H. Romijn J.A.

In addition, the lipolysis rate was increased when assessed directly in vivo (21Hadigan C. Borgonha S. Rabe J. Young V. Grinspoon S. Metabolism. 2002; 51: 1143-1147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Furthermore, dyslipidemia in HAART patients, particularly in patients receiving certain HIV protease inhibitors, is frequently associated with fat tissue redistribution (loss of subcutaneous “peripheral” fat and accumulation of intra-abdominal fat). Thus, enhanced lipolysis may contribute to both the frequently observed loss of subcutaneous fat mass, as well as to the dyslipidemia (22Rudich A. Ben-Romano R. Etzion S. Bashan N. Acta Physiol. Scand. 2005; 183: 75-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Investigating the cellular mechanisms for enhanced adipocyte lipolysis in response to HIV protease inhibitors revealed that the nelfinavir-induced lipolysis rate in 3T3-L1 adipocytes was associated with decreased protein levels of perilipin (23Rudich A.

Furthermore, the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir had no effect on cAMP levels nor on cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (24Adler-Wailes D.C. Liu H. Ahmad F. Feng N. Londos C. Manganiello V. Yanovski J.A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2005; 90: 3251-3261Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This suggests that the increase in lipolysis rate in response to HIV protease inhibitors is mediated by alterations downstream of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (24Adler-Wailes D.C. Liu H. Ahmad F.

In the present study we investigated whether the nelfinavir-associated decrease in perilipin plays a causative role in the increased rates of basal lipolysis. Furthermore, we investigate the underlying cellular mechanisms by which this HIV protease inhibitor reduces adipocyte perilipin protein content.

The cells were used 9–11 days following differentiation induction, when exhibiting >90% adipocyte phenotype. Adipocyte Differentiated from Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEF)—Stable lines of MEF preadipocytes overexpressing peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ were generated from immortalized MEFs of perilipin-null mice (MEF–/–) or wild type controls (MEF+/+) as described (6Miyoshi H.

At confluence the cells were exposed to a pro-differentiation regimen consisting of dexamethasone (1 μm), insulin (5 μg/ml), isobutylmethylxanthine (0.5 mmol/liter), and rosiglitazone (5 μm). After 2 days, the medium was changed, and the cells were maintained in medium containing insulin for 4 days and then in medium without insulin for an additional 4–5 days before use. The cells used for all experiments exhibited >90% adipocyte morphology by light microscopy. For nelfinavir treatment, differentiated adipose cells were incubated in serum-free DMEM supplemented with 0.5% radioimmunoassay grade bovine serum albumin, with or without nelfinavir, and in the presence or absence of the indicated inhibitors. The final nelfinavir medium concentrations were achieved by the appropriate dilutions of a 100 mm stock solution prepared in 100% ethanol. Final ethanol concentrations of up to 0.04% were without measurable effects on the parameters measured in this study. As in previous publications (23Rudich A. Vanounou S. Riesenberg K. Porat M.

Adenovirus-mediated Perilipin Overexpression—The cells were infected as previously described (8Souza S.C. Muliro K.V. Liscum L. Lien P. Yamamoto M.T. Schaffer J.E. Dallal G.E. Wang X. Kraemer F.B. Obin M. Greenberg A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8267-8272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3T3-L1 fibroblasts placed in 12-well plates were cultured in DMEM containing 10% bovine calf serum and differentiated as described above. The adipocytes were infected on day 3 of differentiation with a multiplicity of infection of ∼100 plaque-forming units/cell, by incubation with Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) for 3 h at 37 °C. Eight days later, infected adipocytes were used for the experiments, with at least 70–80% of cells exhibiting increased perilipin content. As a control, recombinant adenovirus expressing GFP was used. Cell Lysates and Western Blots—After treatments, the cells were rinsed three times with PBS and scraped into ice-cold lysis buffer containing 50 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 1 mmol/liter EDTA, 1 mmol/liter EGTA, 50 mmol/liter NaF, 10 mmol/liter sodium β-glycerophosphate, 5 mmol/liter sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmol/liter sodium vanadate, and 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, and inhibitors (a 1:1,000 dilution of protease inhibitor mixture; Sigma). The lysates were gently shaken for 15 min at 4 °C, centrifuged (12,000 × g, 15 min at 4 °C), and the fraction between the pellet and adipose cake was collected. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad Bradford method procedure (Munich, Germany). Protein samples were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subjected to Western blot, followed by quantitation using video densitometry analysis, as described previously (27Tirosh A.

In each experiment the intensity of the band derived from control cells was assigned a value of 1 arbitrary unit, and the intensity of all of the treatment groups was expressed as the fold value of control. Lipolysis—For basal lipolysis measurements, the cells were rinsed three times with PBS (after the indicated period of nelfinavir treatment) and further incubated for 1 h with Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer (50 mmol/liter HEPES, pH 7.4, 128 mmol/liter NaCl, 4.7 mmol/liter KCl, 1.25 mmol/liter CaCl2, 1.25 mmol/liter MgSO4, and 10 mmol/liter sodium phosphate) supplemented with 1% radioimmunoassay grade bovine serum albumin, as previously described (31Rosenstock M. Greenberg A.S. Rudich A. Diabetologia. 2001; 44: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). FFA concentrations in Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer were determined using a commercial kit (Roche Applied Science) following the instructions of the manufacturer and calculated according to a palmitic acid standard curve. Glycerol was measured using a glycerol 3-phosphate oxidase trinder kit (Sigma), as described (31Rosenstock M. Greenberg A.S. Rudich A. Diabetologia. 2001; 44: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Quantitative Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction—cDNA was prepared using a Reverse-iT™ 1st strand synthesis kit (ABgene, UK) and quantitative real time PCR assays were carried out for perilipin A and for 18 S rRNA exactly as previously described (32Ben-Romano R. Rudich A. Etzion S. Potashnik R. Kagan E. Greenbaum U. Bashan N. Antivir. Ther. 2006; 8: 1051-1060Google Scholar). The following primers were used: murine perilipin A, sense, GGCCTGGACGACAAAACC, and antisense, CAGGATGGGCTCCATGAC; murine 18 S rRNA, sense, CGCCGCTAGAGGTGAAATTCT, and antisense, CATTCTTGGCAAATGCTTTCG. Pulse-Chase Experiments—Prior to [35S]methionine incorporation the cells were preincubated for 1 h with methionine-free medium to deplete the cells from intracellular methionine. Next, the cells were pulse-labeled for 5 h with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine added to methionine-free medium. Pulse-labeling reaction was terminated by three washes with PBS supplemented with 1,000-fold unlabeled methionine. The cells were subsequently chased for the indicated time periods in serum-free DMEM, then washed, and lysed in ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 1 mm EDTA) supplemented with proteases inhibitors (a 1:100 dilution of protease inhibitor mixture; Sigma). The cell lysates were prepared as described above. The protein concentration was determined by BCA assay (Pierce), and 0.5 mg of cell lysate protein was used for immunoprecipitation. Anti-perilipin A antibody was linked to prewashed Sepharose A+G beads mix (1:1). Ninety μl of beads mixture were incubated (by gentle shaking) with anti-perilipin A antibody at 4 °C overnight, after which the samples were centrifuged for 1 min at 12,000 rpm, and the supernatant was discarded. Prior to immunoprecipitation, the lysates were precleared by incubation (shaking) with 90 μlof Sepharose-protein A+G mixture for 20 min at 4 °C. Then the samples were centrifuged for 1 min at 12,000 rpm, and the supernatants were added to the Sepharose bead-bound perilipin antibodies. The immunoprecipitation reaction was performed by gentle shaking at 4 °C for 3 h. The immunoprecipitated complex was pelleted by centrifugation at 5000 rpm at 4 °C for 2 min, washed three times with cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and mixed with a 10% SDS Laemmli sample buffer (final SDS concentration, 2%). The samples were boiled at 100 °C for 5 min and centrifuged, and the liquid fraction was resolved by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. The gel was dried using a vacuum gel drier, and [35S]methionine-labeled perilipin A in immunoprecipitates was detected directly by autoradiography using a phosphorimaging device (Fujifilm FLA-5100). Immunofluorescence—The cells were grown on glass coverslips. After treatment, the cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, washed, and incubated with 100 mm glycine for 10 min. Following another wash with PBS, the cells were permeabilized with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min followed by 1 h of incubation in 5% goat serum-supplemented PBS. Next, the cells were incubated with primary anti-perilipin A antibody (dilution of 1:100 in the above blocking solution) for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with Alexa 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:750 dilution in blocking solution) for 1 h, at room temperature, washed, and mounted on glass slides. The images were taken at mid-z-axis height of the cells, using a Zeiss laser confocal IF microscope. The acquisition parameters were kept constant within the experiment to allow comparison between resulting signal intensities. Statistical Analysis—The data are expressed as the means ± S.E. Each treatment was compared with control, and statistical significance of differences between two groups was evaluated using the Student's t test. The criterion for significance was set at p < 0.05. Decreased Perilipin Content in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes Precedes the Increase in Basal Lipolysis Rate Induced by Nelfinavir—We have previously demonstrated that 3T3-L1 adipocytes exposed to nelfinavir exhibit increased constitutive (basal) lipolysis along with decreased expression of the lipid droplet-associated protein, perilipin (23Rudich A. Vanounou S. Riesenberg K. Porat M. Tirosh A. Harman-Boehm I. Greenberg A.S. Schlaeffer F. Bashan N. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1425-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). As a first step in elucidating the role of perilipin in nelfinavir-mediated increase in lipolysis, we compared the chronology of the reduction in perilipin protein with measurements of lipolysis. Time course analysis was performed by assessing perilipin content and glycerol release to the medium following incubation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with 30 μm nelfinavir (Fig. 1). Two hours of nelfinavir treatment were sufficient to induce a statistically significant 15.5 ± 3.1% decrease in perilipin level compared with time 0 (Fig. 1B). The progressive decrease in perilipin content over time (reaching 76.9 ± 11.8% at 24 h) was a specific response to nelfinavir, because HSL and β-actin protein content remained stable (Fig. 1A). In contrast to the early reduction in perilipin content to nelfinavir, a significant increase in basal lipolysis rate appeared only after 8 h of nelfinavir treatment (Fig. 1B), corresponding to a 50% decrease in perilipin. We utilized indirect immunofluorescence and laser confocal microscopy to determine whether gross alterations in cellular morphology and subcellular localization of perilipin occurred in response to nelfinavir. Nelfinavir treatment resulted in a decrease in perilipin signal intensity, without apparent alterations in its distribution (Fig. 1C) or in overall cellular morphology (not shown). Collectively, these findings indicate that a decrease in perilipin cell content temporally precedes nelfinavir-induced lipolysis and that nelfinavir treatment results in a progressive reduction of perilipin protein expression. A Causative Role for Decreased Perilipin Expression in Nelfinavir-induced Lipolysis—To establish a causative relationship between a decrease in perilipin content and an increase in lipolysis induced by nelfinavir, we undertook two complementary approaches. First, we investigated whether nelfinavir increases basal lipolysis in an adipocyte cellular model devoid of perilipin. Second, we determined whether overexpression of perilipin, using an adenovirus expression system, inhibits nelfinavir-induced lipolysis. For the first set of experiments, we used adipocytes differentiated from MEFs of perilipin knock-out (MEF–/–) or wild type (MEF+/+) mice. As reported recently (6Miyoshi H. Souza S.C. Zhang H.H. Strissel K.J. Christoffolete M.A. Kovsan J. Rudich A. Kraemer F.B. Bianco A.C. Obin M.S. Greenberg A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15837-15844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), MEF–/– adipocytes exhibit similar adipogenesis potential to that of MEF+/+. Furthermore, consistent with the phenotype of perilipin knock-out mice, differentiated MEF–/– were observed to have an increased basal lipolysis rate compared with MEF+/+ (Fig. 2A). In response to 18 h of nelfinavir treatment, MEF+/+ adipocytes exhibited a decrease in perilipin content, whereas the expression of HSL was not significantly altered (Fig. 2B), consistent with the effects observed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Ref. 23Rudich A. Vanounou S. Riesenberg K. Porat M. Tirosh A. Harman-Boehm I. Greenberg A.S. Schlaeffer F. Bashan N. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1425-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar and Fig. 1). Thus, MEF-derived adipocytes represent a reliable adipocyte model system to examine the relationship between perilipin and lipolysis in response to nelfinavir. Subsequently, we investigated whether the absence of perilipin altered the ability of nelfinavir to increase basal lipolysis. MEF–/– and MEF+/+ adipocytes were treated with nelfinavir for 18 h, after which glycerol release to the medium was assessed. MEF+/+ cells exhibited a robust increase in basal lipolysis after nelfinavir treatment (nelfinavir concentrations of 30 and 45 μm increased lipolysis by 13.2 ± 3.1- and 24.5 ± 5.3-fold, respectively), whereas only a minor increase was observed in MEF–/– (Fig. 2C). Similar results were observed when measuring FFA release (data not shown). This finding is consistent with the notion that the effect of nelfinavir on basal lipolysis requires the presence of perilipin. If the decrease in perilipin levels is a required step in the induction of lipolysis by nelfinavir (Fig. 1), overexpression of perilipin should prevent the lipolytic response to the drug. To overexpress perilipin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, we utilized adeno-viruses expressing perilipin A under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter (Ad-Peri) or a control adenovirus encoding GFP under the regulation of the same promoter (Ad-GFP) (9Souza S.C. de Vargas L.M. Yamamoto M.T. Lien P. Franciosa M.D. Moss L.G. Greenberg A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24665-24669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Cells infected by Ad-Peri exhibited increased perilipin content compared with cells infected with Ad-GFP (Fig. 3, A and B). In cells where perilipin was overexpressed, as in those infected with the control virus, nelfinavir decreased perilipin protein content in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3, A and B). However, nelfinavir did not alter the expression of either HSL or β-actin, confirming the specific effect of nelfinavir on perilipin protein content. Although nelfinavir decreased perilipin expression in the perilipin overexpressing cells, the remaining perilipin content after 18 h of nelfinavir treatment was still increased as compared with cells infected by the control adenovirus (Fig. 3, A and B). Importantly, perilipin overexpression, as compared with adipocytes transduced with Ad-GFP, significantly blocked the action of nelfinavir to increase adipocyte lipoly"

The viral Orf3 protein activates the cellular mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and is likely to modulate the host cell environment for efficient viral replication. We screened for cellular genes whose transcription was differentially up-regulated in an Orf3-expressing stable cell line (ORF3/4). The gene for mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) was one such candidate. The up-regulation of VDAC in ORF3/4 cells was confirmed by Northern and Western blotting in various cell lines. Transfection of ORF3/4 cells with an ORF3-specific small interfering RNA led to a reduction in VDAC protein levels. VDAC is a critical mitochondrial outer membrane protein, and its overexpression results in apoptosis. Surprisingly, Orf3-expressing cells were protected against staurosporine-induced cell death by preservation of mitochondrial potential and membrane integrity. A small interfering RNA-mediated reduction in Orf3 and VDAC levels also made cells sensitive to staurosporine. Chemical cross-linking showed Orf3-expressing cells to contain higher levels of oligomeric VDAC. These cells also contained higher levels of hexokinase I that directly interacted with VDAC. This interaction is known to preserve mitochondrial potential and prevent cytochrome c release. We report here the first instance of a viral protein promoting cell survival through such a mechanism.

Although the infection is self-limited and never proceeds to chronicity, fulminant hepatitis with high rates of mortality is known to occur in a small fraction of patients, especially in pregnant women (4Khuroo M.S.

The HEV was recently classified as the only member of Hepevirus in the family Hepeviradae (6Emerson S.U. Anderson D. Arankalle A. Meng X.J. Purdy M. Schlauder G.G. Tsarev S.A. Fauquet C.M. Mayo M.A. Maniloff J. Desselberger U. Ball L.A. Virus Taxonomy, VIIIth Report of the ICTV. 2004: 851-855Google Scholar). It is a nonenveloped virus with a single-stranded positive sense RNA genome of ∼7.2 kb and contains three open reading frames (ORFs) (7Tam A.W. Smith M.M. Guerra M.E. Huang C.C. Bradley D.W. Fry K.E. Reyes G.R. Virology. 1991; 185: 120-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). The orf1 encodes the major nonstructural polyprotein, orf2 codes for the major viral capsid protein, and orf3 codes for a small protein whose functions are not fully understood. Due to the lack of reliable cell culture systems or small animal models of infection and disease, subgenomic expression strategies have been employed to functionally characterize HEV-encoded proteins (8Jameel S. Zafrullah M. Ozdener M.H. Panda S.K. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 207-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Zafrullah M. Ozdener M.H. Panda S.K. Jameel S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9045-9053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Zafrullah M. Ozdener M.H. Kumar R. Panda S.K. Jameel S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4074-4082Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The orf3 overlaps the other two ORFs and encodes a protein of 123 amino acids (Orf3). A recent report proposes that Orf2 and Orf3 are translated from the same subgenomic RNA and that the latter protein was 9 amino acids shorter at its N-terminal end than previously reported (11Graff J. Torian U. Nguyen H. Emerson S.U. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 5919-5926Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The Orf3 protein is phosphorylated at a single serine residue by the cellular mitogen-activated protein kinase (9Zafrullah M. Ozdener M.H. Panda S.K. Jameel S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9045-9053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In its N-terminal half, Orf3 contains two hydrophobic domains, the first shown to be responsible for its cytoskeletal association (9Zafrullah M. Ozdener M.H. Panda S.K. Jameel S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9045-9053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In its C-terminal half, the protein contains two proline-rich regions, of which one carries the phosphorylated serine residue (9Zafrullah M. Ozdener M.H. Panda S.K. Jameel S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9045-9053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The other region was shown to contain a PXXPXXP motif and to bind several proteins that contain Src homology 3 domains (12Korkaya H. Jameel S. Gupta D. Tyagi S. Kumar R. Zafrullah M. Mazumdar M. Lal S.K. Xiaofang L. Sehgal D. Das S.R. Sahal D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42389-42400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Such PXXP motifs are part of polyproline helices found in a number of viral and cellular proteins involved in signal transduction and bind the Src homology 3 domains found in a diverse group of signal-transducing molecules (13Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2217) Google Scholar, 14Cohen G.B. Ren R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1995; 80: 237-248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). Previously, we have also shown Orf3 to activate the extracellularly regulated kinase (ERK), a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase superfamily, supporting a prosurvival role for it. The Orf3 protein binds Pyst1, an ERK-specific member of dual specificity mitogen–activated protein kinase phosphatases; this interaction inhibits ERK dephosphorylation, thereby prolonging its activated state (15Kar-Roy A. Korkaya H. Oberoi R. Lal S.K. Jameel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28345-28357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).In the present study, we found increased expression of the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) protein in Orf3-expressing cells. The VDAC protein, also known as porin for its pore forming ability, is a resident outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) protein of 30–35 kDa that regulates the transport of solutes such as Ca2+ and ATP across the OMM (16Colombini M. J. Membr. Biol. 1989; 111: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 17Bernardi P. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1127-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar). The mitochondrion plays an important and fateful role in the apoptotic death of mammalian cells by releasing apoptogenic proteins into the cytoplasm (18Halestrap A.P. Doran E. Gillespie J.P. O'Toole A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 170-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytoplasm activates caspases, setting the cell on an apoptotic path (19Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4433) Google Scholar). The VDAC protein regulates OMM permeability and is in turn regulated by direct interaction with Bcl-2 family members as well as other proteins, such as hexokinase and mitochondrial creatine kinase (20Tsujimoto Y. Shimizu S. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Further, VDAC is known to be up-regulated in cancer cells (21Shinohara Y. Ishida T. Hino M. Yamazaki N. Baba Y. Terada H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6067-6073Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and exhibits elevated binding to hexokinase I and/or hexokinase II. Due to their higher energy requirements, cancer cells are characterized by a high rate of glycolysis (22Arora K.K. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17422-17428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Pedersen P.L. Mathupala S. Rempel A. Geschwind J.F. Ko Y.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1555: 14-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). This in turn requires various genetic and biochemical adaptations, including increased expression of mitochondria-bound isoforms of hexokinase (HK I and HK II) (23Pedersen P.L. Mathupala S. Rempel A. Geschwind J.F. Ko Y.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1555: 14-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 24Rempel A. Bannasch P. Mayer D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1219: 660-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 25Sebastian S. Kenkare U.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Purified HK I has been shown to interact directly with purified VDAC reconstituted into a planar lipid bilayer, leading to channel closure. This prevents opening of the permeability transition pore and release of cytochrome c, thus inhibiting the mitochondrial phase of apoptosis (26Azoulay-Zohar H. Israelson A. Abu-Hamad S. Shoshan-Barmatz V. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). A dynamic equilibrium exists between monomeric and oligomeric forms of VDAC that determines its interactions with other proteins and the regulated formation of pores large enough to allow the release of apoptogenic factors from mitochondria (27Zalk R. Israelson A. Garty E.S. Azoulay-Zohar H. Shoshan-Barmatz V. Biochem. J. 2005; 386: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar).We show here a prosurvival effect of the HEV Orf3 protein and relate this to its ability to modulate VDAC expression and oligomerization. We also show that VDAC oligomerization in Orf3-expressing cells protects against an apoptotic insult and is accompanied by enhanced hexokinase I expression and its interaction with VDAC. These findings are discussed in the context of HEV pathogenesis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids, Cell Lines, and Antibodies—The expression vectors for orf3, pSG-ORF3 (8Jameel S. Zafrullah M. Ozdener M.H. Panda S.K. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 207-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and pORF3-ECFP (15Kar-Roy A. Korkaya H. Oberoi R. Lal S.K. Jameel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28345-28357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) have been described earlier. The orf3 and vector control stable cell lines (12Korkaya H. Jameel S. Gupta D. Tyagi S. Kumar R. Zafrullah M. Mazumdar M. Lal S.K. Xiaofang L. Sehgal D. Das S.R. Sahal D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42389-42400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) as well as polyclonal antibodies to Orf3 (8Jameel S. Zafrullah M. Ozdener M.H. Panda S.K. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 207-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have also been described earlier. The VDAC1, VDAC2, and VDAC3 genes were generously provided by Dr. Michael Forte (Vollum Institute for Advanced Biomedical Research, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, OR). The VDAC antibody was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA), whereas the Alexa dye-conjugated secondary antibodies were procured from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). The EGFP-cytochrome c expression vector was kindly provided by Dr. Israrul Haq Ansari (University of Nebraska, Lincoln, NE).Suppressive Subtractive Hybridization—Suppressive subtractive hybridization was performed using orf3 and vector control stable cell lines according to Mishra et al. (28Mishra R.N. Ramesha A. Kaul T. Nair S. Sopory S.K. Reddy M.K. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 345: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA was isolated from the cells and mRNA prepared by magnetic separation after annealing with biotinylated oligo(dT) primer and immobilizing it onto streptavidin-linked paramagnetic beads. Five μg of mRNA from each cell line was used to synthesize first strand cDNA by separately priming with P1-dT and P2-dT oligonucleotide primers (28Mishra R.N. Ramesha A. Kaul T. Nair S. Sopory S.K. Reddy M.K. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 345: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). After reverse transcription, mRNA and excess primers were removed before ligating the P1–3′ and P2–3′ adaptor oligonucleotides to the 3′-ends of first strand cDNAs with T4 RNA ligase (28Mishra R.N. Ramesha A. Kaul T. Nair S. Sopory S.K. Reddy M.K. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 345: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The first strand cDNA population from control samples was PCR-amplified using 5′ biotinylated P1 forward and nonbiotinylated P1 reverse primers (28Mishra R.N. Ramesha A. Kaul T. Nair S. Sopory S.K. Reddy M.K. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 345: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The PCR conditions included 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 3 min. The biotinylated double-stranded cDNAs thus obtained were immobilized onto streptavidin-linked paramagnetic beads, whereas the nonbiotinylated complementary antisense strands were denatured with 0.15 m NaOH for 10 min at room temperature and separated out from the beads with a magnet. The beads were washed twice with 0.15 m NaOH and used for the first round of cDNA subtraction. The unamplified first strand cDNAs that were made from ORF3/4 cells were hybridized for 5 h at 65 °C with PCR-amplified sense strand cDNAs of control cells that were immobilized onto the magnetic beads. The hybrids between the sense strand and the common complementary antisense cDNA strands, as well as the beads, were magnetically separated. Differentially up-regulated genes in ORF3/4 cells remained in the hybridization solution and were PCR-amplified in a sequence-independent manner with P2 forward and P2 reverse primers. The PCR conditions included 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 3 min. The PCR-amplified differentially expressed cDNA population was then cloned into the pGEMT vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The recombinant plasmids thus obtained were digested with NotI; depending on insert size, six different clones were selected and sequenced, and the genes were identified by BLAST analysis.Northern Blotting—For probe preparation, the VDAC1 clone was digested with AccI-BglI to give a 230-bp fragment, the VDAC2 clone was digested with AccI-HindIII for a 530-bp fragment, and the VDAC3 clone was digested with HindIII for a 470-bp fragment. The probe fragments corresponded to the 3′-ends of the VDAC genes and showed very low nucleotide homology, enabling specific detection of VDAC RNAs by Northern blotting. Total RNA was isolated with Trizol (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer’s guidelines. Samples of total RNA (20 μg/lane) were denatured in 17.4% (v/v) formaldehyde, 50% (v/v) formamide, 20 mm 3-(N-morpholino) propanesulfonic acid, 5 mm sodium acetate, and 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.0) for 5 min at 65 °C and separated on a 1% (w/v) agarose, 0.66 m formaldehyde gel. Following electrophoresis, the RNA was transferred to a nylon membrane (HyBond-N+; Amersham Biosciences) by capillary blotting for 24 h in 10× SSC (1× SSC: 150 mm NaCl and 15 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0) and UV-cross-linked to the nylon membrane. The blot was stained with methylene blue for RNA integrity and equivalence by determining transfer of 28 and 18 S rRNA from the gel. Membranes were prehybridized at 42 °C for 5 h in hybridization solution containing 50% (v/v) deionized formamide, 50 mm sodium phosphate, 0.8 m NaCl, 2% (w/v) SDS, 100 μg salmon sperm DNA/ml, 20 μg of transfer RNA/ml, and 1× Denhardt’s solution (50× Denhardt’s solution: 1% each of bovine serum albumin, Ficoll, and polyvinylpyrrolidone). The VDAC probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a random priming labeling kit (Hexalabel DNA labeling kit; Fermentas). Hybridization was carried out at 42 °C for 20 h in hybridization solution containing the radiolabeled VDAC isoform-specific probe. Membranes were washed sequentially once in 2× SSC at room temperature for 10 min and twice with 0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 30 min. The bands were visualized by autoradiography.Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Cells were lysed with a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The cell lysates were normalized for protein content, and 1 mg of total proteins in 500 μl of lysis buffer were incubated with 10 μl of Protein G-agarose (Amersham Biosciences) beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The precleared lysate was then incubated with 2 μg of anti-hexokinase I polyclonal antibody (sc-6518; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) overnight at 4 °C. This was followed by incubation with 10 μl of Protein G-agarose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. After five washings in lysis buffer, the beads were boiled in Laemmli buffer, and the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. For Western blotting, the separated proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (MDI, Advanced Microdevices Pvt. Ltd., Ambala, India). After blocking with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 5% nonfat milk (Nestle) for 1–2 h at room temperature, the membrane was washed with TBST (TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibody appropriately diluted in TBST containing 5% bovine serum albumin. The blot was then washed three times for 10 min each with TBST and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit or anti-goat IgG diluted in TBST containing 5% nonfat milk. Chemiluminescent detection of proteins was carried out using the Phototope horseradish peroxidase Western blot detection system (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) according to the supplier’s protocol. In all Western blotting experiments, total ERK levels were evaluated as loading controls.Cell Viability Assay—For the cell survival assay, cells were treated with 1 μm staurosporine (STS) for 10 h, followed by two washes with PBS. The treated cells were then stained with 0.25% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 in 10% acetic acid, 50% methanol (v/v) and washed, and the stained colonies of live cells were counted on an Elispot Reader (Bioreader 4000; Biosys). The cell viability was also evaluated in attached cells using a colorimetric assay based on 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) staining (29Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (45530) Google Scholar) that measures mitochondrial function (30Carmichael J. DeGraff W.G. Gazdar A.F. Minna J.D. Mitchell J.B. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 936-942PubMed Google Scholar, 31Vistica D.T. Skehan P. Scudiero D. Monks A. Pittman A. Boyd M.R. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2515-2520PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were either mock-treated or treated with various concentrations of STS for the indicated time(s) followed by the MTT assay. All data are expressed as percentages with respect to mock-treated cells and represent the mean ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments.Mitochondrial Membrane Potential Measurement—The change in mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) was analyzed by flow cytometry using the ΔΨm-sensitive dye 5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′3,3′-tetraethyl benzimidazolcarbocyanine iodide (JC-1; Sigma) (32Cossarizza A. Baccarani-Contri M. Kalashnikova G. Franceschi C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 40-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested, washed once in PBS, and then resuspended in complete culture medium containing 1 μm JC-1 at 37 °C for the indicated time(s) in the presence or absence of 2 μm STS. Stained cells were then washed with PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry. The emission maxima of JC-1 monomers and aggregates are 527 nm (FL-1 channel) and 590 nm (FL-2 channel), respectively.Microscopy—For immunofluorescence staining and colocalization experiments, Huh-7 cells were seeded at about 30% confluence on coverslips in 12-well plates, grown for 18 h, and then cotransfected with Ds-Red Mito and EGFP-cytc, either with or without ECFP-ORF3. Also, pCN and ORF3/4 cells were cotransfected to express Ds-Red Mito and EGFP-cytc. At 48 h post-transfection, the cells were treated with 2 μm STS for 2 h, washed with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, and washed once again in phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were then mounted using Antifade (Bio-Rad) and sealed with a synthetic rubber-based adhesive, Fevibond (Fevicol; Pidilite Industries). Confocal images were collected using a 60× planapo objective on a Bio-Rad Radiance 2100 system attached to a Nikon inverted microscope. Multiple randomly selected cells from each group were analyzed, and the amount (percentage) of EGFP-cytochrome c that colocalized with Ds-Red Mito was quantitated with the LaserPix software (Bio-Rad). Such colocalization calculations are independent of the relative intensities in the green and red channels.Cross-linking Experiments—The pCN and ORF3/4 cells were treated with or without 5 μm STS for 30 min followed by a PBS wash. Cells were lysed by five or six repeated freeze-thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen and at room temperature. The unclarified lysate was then incubated with 1 mm DSP (Pierce) dissolved in Me2SO for 30 min at 30 °C according to manufacturer’s protocol. The Me2SO concentration in control and reagent-containing samples was up to 2.5% (v/v). The reaction was stopped by adding 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and the samples were analyzed on nonreducing as well as reducing SDS-PAGE.siRNA-mediated Knockdown of Orf3 and VDAC—The orf3 siRNA 5′-UCACGUCGUAGACCUACCAUU-3′ was designed using the “Dharmacon siDESIGN Center” program available on the World Wide Web and was obtained from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO) as a duplex. The VDAC1-specific and GFP siRNAs were obtained as siGENOME SMARTpool reagent from Dharmacon. Cells were transfected using RNAiFect (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with 200 nm VDAC siRNA (si-V), 300 nm orf3 siRNA (si-3), and 200 nm GFP siRNA (si-G). All siRNA-related experiments were performed in 12-well culture plates, and GFP-specific siRNA was used as nonspecific control. For siRNA-based survival experiments, cells were transfected, with either the orf3 siRNA for 48 h or the VDAC siRNA pool for 36 h followed by treatment with 2 μm STS for 2 h. The cell viability assays were then performed as described above.Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from pCN and ORF3/4 cells using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Four μg of RNA in a 25-μl reaction mixture was used for cDNA synthesis with Reverse Transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the supplier’s protocol. Of this, 0.5 μl of cDNA was used as a template for PCR amplification of target genes. The PCRs were performed in a 50-μl volume containing 1× reaction buffer, 200 μm dNTPs, 10 pmol of each primer, and 1.25 unit of TaqDNA polymerase (Real Biotech Corp., Taipei, Taiwan), for 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s, and a final extension at 72 °C for 2 min. The primer sequences for hexokinase I and II were retrieved from the World Wide Web and custom-synthesized. Primer pairs HK1-F (5′-TCCTGGCCTATTACTTCACGG-3′) and HK1-R (5′-GGACCTTACGAATGTTGGCAA-3′) and HK2-F (5′-GAGCCACCACTCACCCTACT-3′) and HK2-R (5′-ACCCAAAGCACACGGAAGTT-3′) were used to amplify hexokinase I and II, respectively. The histone H4 gene was amplified as a reference control using the primers HISTH4-F (5′-TGAGAGACAACATTCAGGGCATCAC-3′) and HISTH4-R (5′-CGCTTGAGCGCGTACACCACATCCAT-3′). The amplified products were resolved on a 2% agarose gel and visualized following staining with ethidium bromide. The sizes of the amplified fragments were as follows: hexokinase I, 194 bp; hexokinase II, 130 bp; histone H4, 211 bp.RESULTSSuppression subtractive hybridization was performed using control (pCN) and Orf3-expressing (ORF3/4) stable cell lines as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The differentially expressed cDNAs were PCR-amplified and cloned. A number of clones were randomly picked and analyzed by restriction digestion. Clones with varying sizes of inserts were identified and sequenced to determine the identity of the up-regulated genes they represented. One such up-regulated gene was VDAC1.To validate Orf3-mediated increased expression of VDAC, we carried out Northern and Western blot analyses. The ORF3/4 cell line showed higher levels of VDAC1 RNA (Fig. 1A). Using probes from the 3′-end of the VDAC gene, where minimal homology was observed between VDAC1 and its two other isoforms, VDAC2 and VDAC3, increased expression of all three VDAC isoforms was observed in Orf3-expressing cells (Fig. 1A). To confirm that the higher RNA levels were also reflected in higher levels of the VDAC protein, Western blotting was performed on lysates prepared from pCN and two independent Orf3-expressing cell lines, ORF3/1 and ORF3/4. Western blotting using anti-VDAC antibodies showed higher expression of the VDAC protein in Orf3-expressing cells (Fig. 1B, top, lanes 1–3). Since the anti-VDAC antibodies reacted with all three isoforms of the protein, it was not possible to study the effects on individual isoforms. In another experiment, human hepatoma Huh-7 cells that were transiently transfected with an orf3 expression vector (pSG-ORF3) also showed higher levels of the VDAC protein compared with Huh-7 cells transfected with the empty vector (Fig. 1B, top, lanes 4–6). We checked a HeLa/Tet-OFF-inducible stable cell line 5M. Rajala and S. Jameel, unpublished observations. to show that compared with control cells, the Orf3-expressing cells showed higher levels of the VDAC protein (Fig. 1B, bottom, lanes 1–3). These cells showed leaky expression of Orf3 even in the presence of tetracycline (lane 2); this was also reflected in VDAC expression in HeLa/Tet-OFF/ORF3 cells in the presence (lane 2) and absence of tetracycline (lane 3). Thus, using multiple cell line systems, either transiently transfected or stably expressing Orf3, we show that increased VDAC expression correlated with Orf3 expression.The VDAC protein is the principal mitochondrial channel protein, and its regulated expression is important for cell survival. A higher VDAC expression level in cells results in cell death by apoptosis (33Abu-Hamad S. Sivan S. Shoshan-Barmatz V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 5787-5792Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). For insight into VDAC overexpression in Orf3-stable cell lines, we treated the cells with STS, a potent apoptogenic stimulus. Apoptosis mediated by STS occurs through a mitochondrial pathway and leads to loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential. Cells that survived STS-initiated death were initially scored by staining with Coomassie Blue and counting. Surprisingly, significantly reduced cell death was observed in ORF3/4 cells compared with the control pCN cells (Fig. 2A), which was in contras"
https://openalex.org/W2019488521,"At each round of infection, viruses fall apart to release their genome for replication, and then reassemble into stable particles within the same host cell. For most viruses, the structural details that underlie these disassembly and assembly reactions are poorly understood. Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET), a unique method to investigate large and asymmetric structures at the near molecular resolution, was previously used to study the complex structure of vaccinia virus (VV). Here we study the disassembly of VV by cryo-ET on intact, rapidly frozen, mammalian cells, infected for up to 60 minutes. Binding to the cell surface induced distinct structural rearrangements of the core, such as a shape change, the rearrangement of its surface spikes and de-condensation of the viral DNA. We propose that the cell surface induced changes, in particular the decondensation of the viral genome, are a prerequisite for the subsequent release of the vaccinia DNA into the cytoplasm, which is followed by its cytoplasmic replication. Generally, this is the first study that employs whole cell cryo-ET to address structural details of pathogen-host cell interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2013701126,"Chara corallina class XI myosin is by far the fastest molecular motor. To investigate the molecular mechanism of this fast movement, we performed a kinetic analysis of a recombinant motor domain of Chara myosin. We estimated the time spent in the strongly bound state with actin by measuring rate constants of ADP dissociation from actin·motor domain complex and ATP-induced dissociation of the motor domain from actin. The rate constant of ADP dissociation from acto-motor domain was >2800 s-1, and the rate constant of ATP-induced dissociation of the motor domain from actin at physiological ATP concentration was 2200 s-1. From these data, the time spent in the strongly bound state with actin was estimated to be <0.82 ms. This value is the shortest among known values for various myosins and yields the duty ratio of <0.3 with a Vmax value of the actin-activated ATPase activity of 390 s-1. The addition of the long neck domain of myosin Va to the Chara motor domain largely increased the velocity of the motility without increasing the ATP hydrolysis cycle rate, consistent with the swinging lever model. In addition, this study reveals some striking kinetic features of Chara myosin that are suited for the fast movement: a dramatic acceleration of ADP release by actin (1000-fold) and extremely fast ATP binding rate. Chara corallina class XI myosin is by far the fastest molecular motor. To investigate the molecular mechanism of this fast movement, we performed a kinetic analysis of a recombinant motor domain of Chara myosin. We estimated the time spent in the strongly bound state with actin by measuring rate constants of ADP dissociation from actin·motor domain complex and ATP-induced dissociation of the motor domain from actin. The rate constant of ADP dissociation from acto-motor domain was >2800 s-1, and the rate constant of ATP-induced dissociation of the motor domain from actin at physiological ATP concentration was 2200 s-1. From these data, the time spent in the strongly bound state with actin was estimated to be <0.82 ms. This value is the shortest among known values for various myosins and yields the duty ratio of <0.3 with a Vmax value of the actin-activated ATPase activity of 390 s-1. The addition of the long neck domain of myosin Va to the Chara motor domain largely increased the velocity of the motility without increasing the ATP hydrolysis cycle rate, consistent with the swinging lever model. In addition, this study reveals some striking kinetic features of Chara myosin that are suited for the fast movement: a dramatic acceleration of ADP release by actin (1000-fold) and extremely fast ATP binding rate. Myosin is an actin-based motor protein that converts chemical energy liberated by the ATP hydrolysis into directed movement of actin filaments. Phylogenetic analysis of myosin sequences revealed that there are at least 24 classes of myosin (1Foth B.J. Goedecke M.C. Soldati D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 3681-3686Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Motor functions, such as motility and ATP hydrolysis activity, vary significantly among these classes of myosin. Among those known so far, myosin from alga Chara corallina is the fastest, moving actin filaments at 40–60 μm/s in the in vitro motility assay (2Yamamoto K. Kikuyama M. Sutoh-Yamamoto N. Kamitsubo E. Proc. Japan Acad. 1994; 70: 175-180Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 3Higashi-Fujime S. Ishikawa R. Iwasawa H. Kagami O. Kurimoto E. Kohama K. Hozumi T.

This velocity is ∼10 times faster than that of the fast skeletal muscle myosin (5Uyeda T.Q. Kron S.J. Spudich J.A. J. Mol. Chem. 1990; 214: 699-710Google Scholar). We have been interested in the mechanism how this plant myosin can move so fast. To understand the molecular mechanism of the fast movement, detailed kinetic analysis of Chara myosin is required. However, the yield of native Chara myosin was very low. In addition, the activity of Chara myosin was impaired after multiple purification steps, so that in vitro actin sliding velocity of Chara myosin purified to homogeneity was only one-fourth to one-half of that measured with crude extracts of Chara cells. Therefore, it has been difficult to measure the detailed kinetics of native Chara myosin (2Yamamoto K. Kikuyama M. Sutoh-Yamamoto N. Kamitsubo E. Proc. Japan Acad. 1994; 70: 175-180Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Thus, expression and purification of functional recombinant Chara myosin is crucial to obtain reliable biochemical information. The cDNA of the Chara myosin heavy chain has been cloned (6Kashiyama T. Kimura N. Mimura T. Yamamoto K. J. Biochem. 2000; 127: 1065-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 7Morimatsu M.

The sequence predicts that the myosin consists of a motor domain that belongs to class XI myosin, a neck domain comprising six tandem repeats of IQ motifs and serving as binding sites for six light chains, an α-helical coiled-coil domain supporting dimer formation, and a globular tail domain (see Fig. 1A, native Chara myosin). The functional expression of myosins requires co-expression of the light and heavy chains. Co-expressed calmodulin was bound to IQ motifs and functioned as light chains for some unconventional myosins or myosin fragments such as rat myosin I (myr-1) (8Geeves M.A. Perreault-Micale C.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 302-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Sequence analyses of IQ motifs of these myosins using the Pfam protein families data base indicate that all the IQ motifs of these co-expressed myosin fragments are typical calmodulin-binding IQ motifs (21Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar); i.e. most of Pfam E-values are <10-3 and all are <10-1 for IQ motifs of these co-expressed myosin fragments, whereas a Pfam E-value of <10-3 indicates significant comparison and an E-value in the range of 10-3 to 10-1 indicates a true relationship (22Finn R.D. Mistry J. Schuster-Bockler B. Griffiths-Jones S. Hollich V. Lassmann T. Moxon S. Marshall M. Khanna A. Durbin R. Eddy S.R. Sonnhammer E.L. Bateman A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: D247-D251Crossref PubMed Scopus (1849) Google Scholar). In contrast, three IQ motifs of Chara myosin deviate from the typical calmodulin-binding IQ motif, i.e. Pfam E-values are 0.13, 0.092, and 4.8 for the first, fourth, and sixth IQ motifs, respectively. In accordance with this, Chara myosin heavy chain did not associate with Chara calmodulin when both polypeptides were co-expressed using the baculovirus-insect cell system. 2T. Kashiyama and J. Awata, unpublished observation. Because the light chains of Chara myosin are not well characterized, functional expression of Chara myosin heavy chain with light chains is now difficult. Recently, we succeeded in obtaining functional recombinant Chara myosin motor fragments by expressing the Chara myosin motor domain constructs without the light chain-binding region (23Ito K. Kashiyama T. Shimada K. Yamaguchi A. Awata J. Hachikubo Y. Manstein D.J. Yamamoto K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 312: 958-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the kinetic properties of Chara myosin motor domain construct in detail (Fig. 1A, MD). 3The abbreviations used are: MD, motor domain; S1, subfragment 1; DTT, dithiothreitol; mant, N-methylanthraniloyl. This construct is similar to that reported previously (23Ito K. Kashiyama T. Shimada K. Yamaguchi A. Awata J. Hachikubo Y. Manstein D.J. Yamamoto K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 312: 958-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) but does not have enhanced yellow fluorescent protein moiety because enhanced yellow fluorescent protein can interfere with fluorescence measurements in the stopped-flow apparatus. We made another Chara myosin motor domain construct, referred to as MD-Vneck (Fig. 1A, MD-Vneck). MD-Vneck consists of the Chara myosin motor domain and the neck and tail domains of mouse myosin Va. This construct was used to test whether the velocity of native Chara myosin can be restored using a lever arm with length and stiffness similar to native Chara myosin. Protein Engineering and Expression—A baculovirus transfer vector for MD was generated as follows. Plasmid pTIKL Chara myosin MD (23Ito K. Kashiyama T. Shimada K. Yamaguchi A. Awata J. Hachikubo Y. Manstein D.J. Yamamoto K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 312: 958-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) was mutated to remove enhanced yellow fluorescent protein and add a Myc-epitope sequence at the C-terminal end by site-directed mutagenesis using the ExSite PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The resultant construct, MD, contains residues 4–746 of the Chara myosin heavy chain, a flexible linker (GGG), a Myc-epitope sequence (EQKLISEEDL), and a His8 tag. This was subcloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pFastBac1 (Invitrogen) between the BamHI and HindIII sites. A baculovirus transfer vector for MD-Vneck was generated as follows. Plasmid pTIKL Chara myosin MD was mutated to create the NcoI site, the NheI site at the upstream region of the nucleotide sequence encoding residue 4 of the Chara myosin heavy chain, and the downstream region of the nucleotide sequence encoding residue 740 of the Chara myosin heavy chain, respectively. This plasmid was cut with NcoI and NheI (an NcoI-NheI fragment of Chara myosin MD). A baculovirus transfer vector for mouse myosin Va (M5Full) in pFastBac1 (24Li X.D. Mabuchi K. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 315: 538-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 25Li X.D. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17815-17822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) was mutated to create the NheI site at the upstream region of the nucleotide sequence encoding residue 767 of the mouse myosin Va heavy chain. Because an NcoI site exists between an N-terminal tag and the N terminus of mouse myosin Va heavy chain, this plasmid was cut with NcoI and NheI and ligated with the NcoI-NheI fragment of Chara myosin MD. The resultant construct, MD-Vneck, encodes the N-terminal tag (MSYYHHHHHHDYKDDDDKNIPTTENLYFQGA) containing the sequence of His6 tag and FLAG tag (DYKDDDDK), residues 4–740 of Chara myosin heavy chain, linker consisting of two amino acids (AS), and residues 767–1853 of mouse myosin Va heavy chain. To express MD and MD-Vneck, an 800-ml culture of High Five™ cells (Invitrogen) were infected with viruses expressing the respective heavy-chain constructs. For MD-Vneck, mouse calmodulin was co-produced by co-infection with virus expressing mouse calmodulin (12Homma K. Saito J. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34766-34771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The infected cells were cultured in Erlenmeyer flasks (1 liter × 4) at 28 °C and 130 rpm for 43 h. The lever arm length of MD and MD-Vneck was determined using crystal structure of myosin Va (PDB code: 1W7J). Because the crystal structure of myosin Va has only one IQ motif, the length of six IQ motifs of MD-Vneck was calculated by multiplying the length of one IQ motif of the crystal of myosin Va by 6. Protein Purification—MD was purified using the method of Homma et al. (12Homma K. Saito J. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34766-34771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Cells were harvested and washed with 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. The pelleted cells were suspended with 3 vol/g cells of buffer A (150 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EGTA, 10 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 30 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and a mixture of protease inhibitors consisting of 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 50 μg/ml N-p-tosyl-l-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride and 40 μg/ml l-1-tosyl-amido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone) containing 1 mm ATP. Then 3 vol/g cells of buffer A containing 1 mm ATP, 2% Triton X-100 was added, and the ingredients were mixed. After incubation on ice for 15 min, the lysate was centrifuged at 228,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was incubated with 0.2 mg/ml F-actin, 50 mm glucose, and 20 units/ml hexokinase in a 50-ml tube on a rotating wheel for 2 h at 4°C to hydrolyze completely residual ATP and centrifuged (228,000 × g for 30 min) to co-precipitate the MD. The pellets were washed once with buffer A and then resuspended with buffer B (300 mm KCl, 7 mm MgCl2, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0) containing 5 mm ATP. The supernatant was mixed with 0.3 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) in a 50-ml tube on a rotating wheel for 1 h at 4°C. The resin suspension was then loaded on a column and was washed with 20 ml of buffer B containing 1 mm ATP and 10 mm imidazole, followed by 10 ml of buffer B containing 1 mm ATP and 15 mm imidazole and 10 ml of buffer B containing 10% glycerol and 15 mm imidazole. MD was eluted with buffer B containing 10% glycerol and 250 mm imidazole. The eluted MD was dialyzed overnight against 75 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, and 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, at 0–4 °C. MD-Vneck was purified using the method of Li et al. (24Li X.D. Mabuchi K. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 315: 538-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Cells were harvested and washed with 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. The pelleted cells were suspended with 3 vol/g cells of buffer C (100 mm NaCl, 200 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 7 mm ATP, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm DTT, 30 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and a mixture of protease inhibitors). Then 3 vol/g cells of buffer C containing 2% Triton X-100 was added, and the ingredients were mixed. After incubation on ice for 15 min, the lysate was centrifuged at 228,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was mixed with 0.3 ml of anti-FLAG M2 affinity resin (Sigma) in a 50-ml tube on a rotating wheel for 3 h at 4°C. The resin suspension was then loaded on a column and was washed with 30 ml of buffer D (300 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 30 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and a mixture of protease inhibitors) containing 1 μm mouse calmodulin, followed by 3 ml of buffer D. MD was eluted with buffer D containing 0.2 mg/ml of 3×FLAG peptide (Sigma). Mouse calmodulin was expressed in High Five™ cells by infecting virus expressing mouse calmodulin (12Homma K. Saito J. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34766-34771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and purified using the method of Awata et al. (26Awata J. Saitoh K. Shimada K. Kashiyama T. Yamamoto K. Plant Cell Physiol. 2001; 42: 828-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Rabbit skeletal muscle actin was prepared using the method of Spudich and Watt (27Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using the Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent (Pierce) for MD and MD-Vneck with Dictyostelium S1 as the standard. The concentrations of Dictyostelium S1 and actin were determined spectrophotometrically using extinction coefficients of 0.80 cm2/mg at 280 nm for S1 (28Uyeda T.Q. Tokuraku K. Kaseda K. Webb M.R. Patterson B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9525-9534Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and 0.62 cm2/mg at 290 nm for actin (29Gordon D.J. Yang Y.Z. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7474-7479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—After SDS-PAGE, proteins in the gel were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was incubated with blocking solution, 1% gelatin in TTBS (Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5, containing 0.05% Tween 20), and reacted with mouse anti-calmodulin monoclonal antibody raised against a synthetic peptide equivalent to an amino acid sequence in the C terminus of all vertebrate calmodulins (Zymed Laboratories Inc., cat. no. 13-6900) (30Sacks D.B. Porter S.E. Ladenson J.H. McDonald J.M. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The protein band recognized by primary antibody was detected by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Promega, cat. no. S3721). ATPase and in Vitro Motility Assays—Steady-state ATPase activities were measured as described (23Ito K. Kashiyama T. Shimada K. Yamaguchi A. Awata J. Hachikubo Y. Manstein D.J. Yamamoto K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 312: 958-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), except for that the reaction was done at 25 °C and assays of MD-Vneck were done in the presence of exogenous calmodulin (∼1 μm). The velocity of MD was measured using an antibody-based version of the in vitro sliding filament assay (31Sweeney H.L. Rosenfeld S.S. Brown F. Faust L. Smith J. Xing J. Stein L.A. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6262-6270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), in which anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc., cat. no. 13-2500) was used. The velocity of MD-Vneck was measured using the standard in vitro motility assay (5Uyeda T.Q. Kron S.J. Spudich J.A. J. Mol. Chem. 1990; 214: 699-710Google Scholar), except that the glass surface was not coated with nitrocellulose, and exogenous calmodulin (∼1 μm) was added in the assay buffer. Average sliding velocities were determined by measuring the displacements of actin filaments that were smoothly moving for distances greater than 10 μm. Transient Kinetic Experiments—All kinetic experiments were done in 25 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, using an Applied Photophysics SX18MV stopped-flow spectrophotometer (dead time: 1.15 ms). Measurements were done at 25 °C unless otherwise mentioned. Dissociation of acto-MD by ATP was monitored through changes in fluorescence intensities of pyrene-labeled actin stabilized by phalloidin. Pyrene-actin was excited at 365 nm, and the fluorescence was detected after passing through a 389 nm cut-off filter (32Batra R. Geeves M.A. Manstein D.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6126-6134Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Binding of mantATP and mantADP to MD was monitored by the increase of their fluorescence accompanying association of mantATP and mantADP with MD complex (33Jontes J.D. Milligan R.A. Pollard T.D. Ostap E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14332-14337Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Dissociation of mantADP from MD and acto-MD was monitored by the decrease of its fluorescence. mantATP and mantADP were excited at 290 nm via fluorescence resonance energy transfer from tryptophan of MD, and emission was observed after passing through a 389 nm cutoff filter. In this study, we designed and expressed two recombinant Chara myosin motor domain constructs. We refer to the first as MD and the second as MD-Vneck (Fig. 1A). MD contains only the Chara myosin motor domain and does not contain light-chain binding sites and light chains. The lever arm length of MD is 3 nm if the fulcrum of the converter rotation is assumed to be at the distal end of the SH1 helix (34Geeves M.A. Holmes K.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 687-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Because the primary structure deduced from the cDNA shows that Chara myosin has six light-chain binding IQ motifs (6Kashiyama T. Kimura N. Mimura T. Yamamoto K. J. Biochem. 2000; 127: 1065-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), the lever arm length of native Chara myosin is expected to be the same as that of myosin Va, 24 nm (Fig. 1A). Thus the lever arm length of MD is one-eighth (3 nm/24 nm) that of native Chara myosin. MD-Vneck consists of the motor domain of Chara myosin and a neck, coiled-coil, and globular tail domains of mouse myosin Va. The lever arm length of MD-Vneck is 24 nm and is expected to be the same as that of native Chara myosin. MD was expressed in insect High Five™ (Invitrogen). So far Sf9 cells have been used for the baculovirus-insect cell system to express myosins (8Geeves M.A. Perreault-Micale C. Coluccio L.M. J. Biol.

However, High Five™ cells (Invitrogen) were used in this study, because the expression yields of Chara myosin constructs in these cells were more than two times larger than those in Sf9 cells. After expression in High Five™ cells, MD was purified by co-precipitation with actin and by nickel-affinity resin (Fig. 1B). The yield of MD was ∼1 mg of protein from 2 × 109 High Five™ cells (800 ml of culture). MD-Vneck was co-expressed with mouse calmodulin in High Five™ cells and purified with an anti-FLAG antibody affinity resin. The yield of MD-Vneck was ∼0.1 mg of protein from 2 × 109 High Five™ cells (800 ml of culture). Purified MD-Vneck contained two low molecular weight bands. We speculate that one of these bands is a post-translationally modified form of calmodulin that produced specifically in High Five™ cells, because both bands were recognized by anti-calmodulin monoclonal antibody raised against a synthetic peptide equivalent to an amino acid sequence in the C terminus of all vertebrate calmodulins (Fig. 1C) (30Sacks D.B. Porter S.E. Ladenson J.H. McDonald J.M. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and because only one band (lower molecular weight) was bound to MD-Vneck when co-expressed in Sf9 cells. In addition, no detectable bands were observed when only MD-Vneck was expressed in High Five™ cells. Anyway, both bands are most certainly calmodulin, because they showed calcium-dependent shift in mobility in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B). Judging from the molecular weight, the lower band seems to be a native calmodulin. The basal Mg2+-ATPase activity of MD was 0.59 ± 0.045 phosphate release/s/head at 25 °C. In the presence of actin, the Mg2+-ATPase activity of MD largely increased (Fig. 2). Vmax and Kapp values of MD were 390 ± 13 phosphate release/s/head and 16 ± 1.6 μm, respectively (25 °C). These values were similar to those of MD used in our previous study (23Ito K. Kashiyama T. Shimada K. Yamaguchi A. Awata J. Hachikubo Y. Manstein D.J. Yamamoto K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 312: 958-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Vmax and Kapp values of MD-Vneck were 220 ± 4.7 phosphate release/s/head and 10 ± 0.7 μm, respectively (25 °C). The same solution (25 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, and 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) was used for the steady-state ATPase activity measurement, motility assay, and the kinetic analysis, so data obtained in these different assays could be compared. ATP-induced Dissociation of Acto-MD—We used MD for kinetic analysis, because kinetic analysis of single-headed MD is easier than double-headed MD-Vneck, and stopped-flow measurements require a large quantity of protein. Kinetic modeling and simulations (11De La Cruz E.M. Wells A.L. Rosenfeld S.S. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In all scheme and reactions in this work, A and M represent actin and MD, respectively. k+i and k-i are the forward and reverse rate constants in the presence of actin, respectively. Ki = (k-i/k+i) represents the equilibrium constant in the presence of actin. In the absence of actin, these are expressed as k+i, k-i, and Ki. The ATP-induced dissociation reaction of MD from actin can be described as a two-step process (Reaction 1), and the rate constant is expressed as K1k+2[ATP]/(1 + K1[ATP]) (35Millar N.C. Geeves M.A. FEBS Lett. 1983; 160: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). AM+ATPK1⇄AM(ATP)k+2→A+M·ATP(Eq. 1) The first step in Reaction 1 is the formation of a collision complex of acto-MD and ATP, which is in rapid equilibrium. The second step is dissociation of MD-ATP from actin following the isomerization of MD. When ATP concentration is low, the observed rate constant (kobs) can be approximated as K1k+2[ATP]. To determine K1k+2, the acto-MD complex was dissociated by mixing with 10–100 μm ATP, and the dissociation rate was plotted against ATP concentration (Fig. 3). This dissociation was monitored by the increase in the pyrene fluorescence labeled on actin (36Geeves M.A. Jeffries T.E. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The mean K1k+2 value from four different MD preparations was 4.1 ± 0.1 μm-1 s-1. To determine the k+2 value, fitting the data to hyperbola at saturating ATP concentrations is needed (11De La Cruz E.M. Wells A.L. Rosenfeld S.S. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, the observed rate constant increased linearly with the increase in the ATP concentration and did not deflect from the linear line even until the detection limit of the stopped-flow apparatus (∼1,000 s-1). Thus we obtained k+2 values at low temperatures (<13 °C), and the k+2 value at 25 °C was estimated by extrapolating these values"

Biological membranes represent a physical barrier that isolates cellular components from the external environment. Exchanges between cells and their surroundings are brought about by structural changes of the lipid bilayer that lead either to fusion events (vesicular trafficking) or to the formation of pores (exchange through channels). Membrane-enveloped and non-enveloped viruses represent a paradigm for the study of membrane deformations (1Smith A.E. Helenius A. Science. 2004; 304: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Enveloped viruses carry membrane-anchored glycoproteins that mediate fusion between viral and cellular membranes. The considerable number of studies carried out on viral glycoproteins, in particular the large number of x-ray crystal structure determinations (2Wilson I.A. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C.

In contrast, the entry pathway of non-enveloped viruses is not as well understood. For positive-strand RNA (+sRNA) viruses such as polio-virus, binding of the virus to its receptor results in large capsid rearrangements. The hydrophobic N terminus of the VP1 protein moves to the particle surface while the myristoylated internal protein VP4 inserts into the target membrane (6Hogle J.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2002; 56: 677-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 7Bubeck D. Filman D.J. Hogle J.M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 615-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Noda-viruses, others +sRNA viruses, have a unique capsid protein (8Wery J.P. Reddy V.S. Hosur M.V. Johnson J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 565-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) associated to a peptide, the γ peptide (44 residues). Both capsid protein and peptide result from the self-cleavage of a capsid protein precursor. The γ peptide has the capacity to permeabilize biological membranes allowing genome translocation through the membrane (9Bong D.T. Steinem C. Janshoff A. Johnson J.E. Reza Ghadiri M. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 473-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 10Janshoff A. Bong D.T. Steinem C. Johnson J.E. Ghadiri M.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5328-5336Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The recent determination of the atomic structure of the γ peptide membrane-active domain demonstrates similarities with the fusion peptides of glycoproteins of enveloped viruses: both are formed by a kinked helix (11Maia L.F. Soares M.R. Valente A.P. Almeida F.C. Oliveira A.C. Gomes A.M. Freitas M.S. Schneemann A. Johnson J.E. Silva J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 238: 29278-29286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The γ peptide is located inside the capsid and is brought toward the membrane during entry. For these viruses, all these rearrangements are believed to result in the formation of a narrow channel that allows the genomic RNA to reach the cytoplasm. In contrast to +sRNA viruses, dsRNA viruses have to maintain their genome hidden from the cellular defense mechanisms at all steps of the viral cycle. Consequently, a large object, the capsid-protected genome, needs to cross the cell membrane. Most dsRNA viruses possess several concentric shells. During entry, the external capsid layer is generally lost and its constitutive proteins, or their cleavage products, are thought to induce a local destabilization of the cellular membrane allowing virus translocation (12Chandran K. Nibert M.L. Trends Microbiol. 2003; 11: 374-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that mammalian reovirus produce a myristoylated peptide (μ1N) that can induce size-selective pores in membranes (13Agosto M.A. Ivanovic T. Nibert M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 16496-16501Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The release of this peptide associated to pore formation (13Agosto M.A. Ivanovic T. Nibert M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Virol. 2006; 80: 12367-12376Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) are thought to lead to virus entry into the cell. Birnaviruses only possess a single-layered capsid (15Coulibaly F.

Leong J.C. Mundt E. Vakharia V.N. Wu J.L. Birnaviridae. Academic Press, London2005Google Scholar). Four peptides (pep46, pep7a, pep7b, and pep11) being 46, 7, 7, or 11 amino acids in length, respectively, are found in the case of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) (22Da Costa B. Chevalier C. Henry C. Huet J.C. Petit S. Lepault J. Boot H. Delmas B. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 2393-2402Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These peptides are generated through the processing of the viral polyprotein pVP2-VP4-VP3 (Fig. 1). VP4 is a protease that cleaves its own N and C termini, thus releasing pVP2 and VP3 within the infected cell (23Birghan C. Mundt E. Gorbalenya A.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Subsequent serial cleavages at the C terminus of pVP2 yield the mature VP2 capsid protein and the four peptides.In this study, we show that pep46 deforms biological membranes, leading to the formation of pores. We determined by NMR the atomic structure of this peptide. The membrane-active domain is formed by two kinked α-helices linked by a proline displaying cis-trans isomerization that controls peptide hydrophobicity. These results combined with reverse genetic studies permit the proposition of a general model describing the cell entry pathway of a non-enveloped virus.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPeptide Synthesis—The peptides were obtained by automated solid-phase synthesis using the 9-fluorenylmethoxy carbonyl strategy and purified by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography using standard procedures. The peptides were analyzed by mass spectrometry and confirmed to have purity higher than 98%.Peptide Activity—The hepatocarcinoma epithelial chicken LMH cell line was grown in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate. The activity of the peptides was determined by studying their effects on live cells. After incubation at 37 °C, LDH release was measured using the cytotox 96 nonradioactive kit (Promega), as described by the manufacturer. The percentage of LDH release was determined taking in account the OD values found on untreated and Triton X-100-treated cells. All experiments were carried out five times on duplicated samples; all measurements gave similar results. Liposomes containing carbofluoresceine (CF) were prepared as described by Nandi et al. (24Nandi P. Charpilienne A. Cohen J. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 3363-3367Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The release of CF after addition of peptides or virus was monitored by the increase of fluorescence at 520 nm, using a 492-nm excitation band in a thermostatted Perkin-Elmer LS50B spectrofluorimeter. The value for 100% release was obtained by addition of Triton X-100 at the end of the reaction. All fluorescent experiments were carried out at least three times and gave similar results.Electron Cryomicroscopy—Microscopy was performed as previously described (25Adrian M. Dubochet J. Lepault J. McDowall A.W. Nature. 1984; 308: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). A drop of the studied sample was adsorbed to air glow-discharged holey carbon films. The excess of liquid was removed and the grid frozen in liquid nitrogen cooled ethane. The grid was transferred into a Gatan 6226 cryo-holder and observed with a Philips CM12 electron microscope operated at 80 kV. The micrographs were recorded at a magnification of 35,000 under standard low dose exposition conditions.Sample Preparation and NMR Spectroscopy—Pep46 was dissolved at pH 3.5 in an aqueous 40 mm dodecylphosphocholin (DPC) solution at a final concentration of 1 mm. Two-dimensional phase-sensitive 1H Clean-TOCSY with 70 ms spin lock, and 100 ms and 200 ms mixing times NOESY experiments (26Kumar A. Ernst R.R. Wuthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 95: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2014) Google Scholar) were recorded at 313 K and 333 K on an AVANCE Bruker spectrometer operating at 600.14 MHz without sample spinning with 2K real points in t2, with a spectral width of 6000 Hz and 512 t1-increments. Pulsed-field gradients (27Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3500) Google Scholar) were used for water suppression. The data were processed using XWIN-NMR software (Bruker). A π/6 phase-shifted sine bell window function was applied prior to Fourier transformation in both dimensions (t1 and t2). The temperature was externally controlled using a special temperature control system (BCU 05 Bruker).NMR Structure Determination—NOE cross-peak volumes measured on NOESY spectrum (NOESY, 200 ms mixing time, 333 K) were converted into distances, semiquantitatively, by counting contour levels. Using the Tyr-2,6H geminal, and Asp-Hβ protons as calibration peak, NOE signals were classified into 5 categories with upper distance limits ranging from 2.5 to 5 Å. Pseudo-atom corrections were added when necessary. Calculations were performed using the standard procedures in X-PLOR version 3.84 (28Nilges M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M.

Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4329) Google Scholar).Virus Rescue Experiments—To generate infectious IBDV mutants from cDNA clones, a previously described strategy was used (22Da Costa B. Chevalier C. Henry C. Huet J.C. Petit S. Lepault J. Boot H. Delmas B. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 2393-2402Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Cells at 90% confluence in P12 wells were infected with the vaccinia virus MVA-T7 at a multiplicity of infection of 1. After a 1-h adsorption, the cells were rinsed with the RPMI medium. In the mean time, pT7-A-HDR derivates and pT7-B-HDR plasmids allowing the transcription of genome segments A and B, respectively, were mixed (0.5 μg of each plasmid) with 3.5 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in 350 μl of Opti-MEM and were kept at room temperature for 30 min. The cells were again rinsed in OptiMEM and incubated with the DNA-Lipofectamine 2000 mixture at 37 °C for 5 h. Next, 1.5 ml of complemented RPMI medium was added to each well. Recombinant mutant viruses were recovered 48-h post-transfection after filtration through a 0.22-μm-pore-size filter. At least three independent transfection experiments were carried out to analyze each pT7-A-HDR derivative. The viruses were amplified on LSCC-BK3 cells. IBDV-infected LSCC-BK3 cells were analyzed 3 or 5 days postinfection. Briefly, the cells were fixed with 2.5% PFA in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at room temperature and permeabilized by incubation for 10 min in 0.1% Triton X-100. Fixed cells were incubated with a 1:250 dilution of an anti-VP3 monoclonal antibody. Next, the cells were rinsed and incubated with an anti-immunoglobin mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate in phosphate-buffered saline-0.05% Tween. The cells were rinsed three times and subjected to FACScalibur (Becton Dickinson) analysis using the Cell Quest Pro software.VLP-GFP Cell Binding Assay—Fluorescent VLP were produced as described by Chevalier et al. (31Chevalier C. Lepault J. Erk I. Da Costa B. Delmas B. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 2384-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The VLP were incubated on permissive and non-permissive cells at 4 °C for 30 min in the presence and absence of calcium. The cells were rinsed twice with OptiMEM (Invitrogen) containing the adequate concentration of calcium and analyzed with the FACScalibur.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe Membrane-active Domain of pep46—Fig. 1A shows the schematic representation of the IBDV polyprotein maturation process. A sequence alignment between different birnavirus pep46 homologues reveals only six conserved residues, three of them proline. All sequences display identical clusters of similar amino acids allowing the definition of three domains: the central hydrophobic domain containing most of the conserved residues (three prolines at positions 16, 23, and 27, a threonine at position 20 and the following leucine) and the two flanking domains mainly constituted by both hydrophobic and charged residues. Whereas the N-terminal domain is positively charged, the C-terminal is some-what negatively charged. The N-terminal domain is predicted as forming an amphipathic α-helix with positively charged residues on one side of the helix and hydrophobic residues on the other side (22Da Costa B. Chevalier C. Henry C. Huet J.C. Petit S. Lepault J. Boot H. Delmas B. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 2393-2402Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). As far as the positions of charged and hydrophobic residues are concerned, the sequence similarity between pep46 of different IBDV strains (data not shown) and different birnaviruses (Fig. 1A) is higher in the N-terminal than in the C-terminal domain, suggesting a critical role of this α-helix in the viral cycle. The overall hydrophobicity of pep46 strongly suggests potential interactions of this peptide with membranes. Fig. 1B shows that cells incubated with pep46 undergo spectacular morphological modifications characterized by significant shrinkage and cytoplasm vacuolization. Video light microscopy shows that pep46-treated cells first swell and then undergo important membrane deformations that are associated to massive losses of cellular material (not shown). All these changes result in round ghost cells that have lost their initial morphology (Fig. 1B). As already shown for mammalian reoviruses (Agosto et al., 13Agosto M.A. Ivanovic T. Nibert M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 16496-16501Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), these observations can be interpreted as arising from partial permeabilization of the cellular membrane that leads to the establishment of a high osmotic pressure, resulting in severe cell damage. To identify the membrane-active domain of pep46, several peptides derived from its primary sequence, were synthesized and their effects analyzed on cells. Peptides made of the first 15 (pep15), of the 22 N-terminal amino acids (pep22) and of the last 24 C-terminal residues (pep24) were synthesized (Fig. 1B). Although attenuated, the effects of both pep22 and pep15 were similar to that of pep46 with a rounding of the cells and a loss of cellular material. While pep22 was found to be more efficient than pep15, pep24 had no effect on cells. All these observations demonstrate that pep46 and in particular its N-terminal moiety, pep22, destabilize cell membranes.The Permeabilizing Activity of pep46—The permeabilizing activity of pep46 and its shorter derivates, pep22, pep15, and pep24 was quantified by measuring the release of a cytoplasmic enzyme (LDH) induced by each peptide. Although the results are only illustrated for an IBDV-permissive cell line (LMH cells; Fig. 2), similar data were obtained for both permissive and non-permissive cells. The effects of the peptides were analyzed for time (Fig. 2A) and concentration (Fig. 2B) dependence. Fig. 2A shows that the peptides permeabilize membranes with characteristic kinetic constants and lag periods. While a lag period cannot be evaluated in the case of pep46, its existence is clearly visible for pep22 and pep15. Pep15 displays a longer lag period than pep22. The existence of a lag period indicates that the membrane permeabilization is a multi-step event. No activity could be detected for pep24. Fig. 2B shows that all peptides are characterized by a critical concentration below which the peptides have no effect on the LDH release. The critical concentration increases evenly following the order of the series: pep46, pep22, and pep15. No effect could be detected for pep24 up to a concentration of 20 μm. All these experiments demonstrate that pep46 and particularly its N-terminal moiety permeabilize cell membranes. To assess the efficiency of pep46, we compared its activity to the one of the membrane-active domain (γ1) of the nodavirus γ peptide. We found that γ1 is 10-20-fold less efficient than pep22. While it can be seen on Fig. 2B that the critical concentration of pep22 is about 3 μm, the one of γ1 peptide is equal to 30-50 μm (data not shown).FIGURE 2Membrane permeabilization activity of pep46 and derivates. A and B show the peptide activity on cells quantified by LDH release and expressed as a percentage of the total cellular LDH. A, effect of time on LDH release. Peptides were incubated with cells at a concentration of 10 μm. The amino acid sequence of pep22P16A is identical to the one of pep22 except proline in position 16 that is substituted by an alanine. No release was observed with pep24. B, effect of concentration on LDH release. The activities of pep15 and pep22P16A display the same concentration dependence. Again, no activity could be observed with pep24. C and D show the release of the fluorescent probe from synthetic liposomes. The peptide activity was quantified by the fluorescent probe leakage and expressed as a percentage of the total unquenched fluorescence (when liposomes were treated with Triton X-100). In A and B, results are mean ± S.D. of five distinct experiments. C, activities of pep22 and pep24 at a concentration of 1 μm were compared. Triton X-100 indicates the time at which Triton X-100 has been added to the samples to validate the quality of the liposomes containing the fluorescent probe. Again, no activity of pep24 was detected. D, effect of peptide concentration and time. The activity of pep46 was measured and found concentration dependent in the nanomolar to micromolar range. E, comparison of the effects of pep46 and pep22 on liposomes. F, effect of avidin binding at the N and C terminus of pep22.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The membrane permeabilization induced by pep46 could depend on a perturbation of the metabolism that controls cellular entry processes such as endocytosis. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the influence of a metabolic inhibitor. The depletion of the cellular ATP pool did not influence the activity of pep46 and its shorter derivates (not shown). Therefore, pep46 and in particular, its N-terminal moiety (pep22), display a membrane activity that is energy-independent. All these features were observed on permissive and non-permissive cells, demonstrating that pep46 or derivates interact with the lipid bilayer, resulting in the formation of a pore, even in the absence of a specific receptor.To further characterize the pore formation mechanism, we studied the activity of these peptides on synthetic membranes. The peptides were incubated with liposomes containing a fluorescent probe, which due to quenching effects has a fluorescence signal strongly depending upon concentration. The release of the probe from the liposomes leads to a lowering of the probe concentration and thus to an increase of the fluorescence signal. With pep22, at a concentration of 1 μm, the release of the probe from liposomes is achieved within a few seconds (Fig. 2C). Up to a concentration of 2 mm, the release is independent of the presence of calcium or a chelating molecule (EDTA, data not shown). With this assay as with others, pep24 is found to be inactive on membranes. Fig. 2, D and E panels illustrate the results obtained with both pep46 and pep22. The release of the probe from the liposomes has kinetic characteristics similar to those previously described on cultured cells: the existence of a critical concentration and short lag period particularly visible at low concentrations. Because of the membrane composition and cell organization, the fluorescence assay on liposomes allows the detection of pores at concentrations that are three orders of magnitude lower than the LDH release assay.Polarity in the Interaction of pep22 with Membranes—To analyze the importance of the N and C termini of pep22 in membrane destabilization, a reporter protein, fluorescent streptavidin, was attached either at its N or C terminus. The labeled pep22 were added to liposomes containing a fluorescent probe. Fig. 2F shows that the binding of avidin to either the N or the C termini of pep22 inhibits, but does not block the release of the probe from the liposomes treated with the peptide. These results demonstrate that the addition of an exogenous charged polypeptide at both termini does not prevent the formation of pores in synthetic membranes. Both peptide termini are thus accessible during the pore formation process and remain in the vicinity of the polar heads of the membrane.Visualization of the Pores by Electron Cryomicroscopy—The deformations of synthetic membranes induced by pep46 and shorter derivates were analyzed by electron cryomicroscopy. Fig. 3a shows liposomes visualized in the absence (left) and presence (right) of pep22. Pep46 has similar effects on liposomes than pep22. At low magnification, both samples appear similar. Although multi-lamellar vesicles are visible, most of the liposomes are uni-lamellar and characterized by heterogeneous diameter values. Polar head and aliphatic chain domains of the lipid constituting the liposome bilayer are easily discerned. At higher magnification, a significant effect of pep22 on liposomes is observed (Fig. 3b). Whereas in the absence of pep22, the polar heads constituting the liposome bilayers form lines that are parallel over long distances (left), in the presence of pep22, the lines are parallel over much smaller distances (right). In fact, in this latter case, the bilayer thickness varies giving rise to areas characterized by the presence of parallel lines that rapidly alternate with fuzzy lines. In accordance with this observation, the contrast of the membrane is lowered when pep22 is added to the liposomes. The fuzzy domains often show fusion of the external and internal leaflets of the bilayers (Fig. 3c) demonstrating the formation of an aqueous channel within the membrane that will be defined as a pore. The diameter of the pore is not constant; while it is smaller than the picture resolution (about 2 nm) in the left and middle panels, it is larger in the right panel, but the diameter of the pores were always found less than 10 nm. In all cases, the diameter of the pore is smaller than the diameter of the IBDV virion (60-70 nm). No significant effect of pep24 on liposomes could be observed (not shown).FIGURE 3Visualization by cryomicroscopy of the structural effects induced by pep22. a, panels show the liposomes in the absence (left) and the presence (right) of pep22. In both cases, liposomes having various diameters are observed. In general, they are unilamellar. The bilayered structure of the membrane is clearly visible. b, when the membranes are observed at higher magnification, significant differences are observed in the presence of pep22. While the position of the polar heads of the lipids gives rise to parallel lines over long distances when"

https://openalex.org/W2125124193,"Satellite cells are stem cells that are critical for the formation and growth of skeletal muscle during myogenesis. To differentiate and fuse, proliferating satellite cells or myoblasts must migrate and establish stable cell-cell contacts. However, the factors that regulate myoblast migration and fusion are not understood completely. We have identified PGI2 as a novel regulator of myogenesis in vitro. PGI2 is a member of the family of prostaglandins (PG), autocrine/paracrine signaling molecules synthesized via the cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 pathways. Primary mouse muscle cells both secrete PGI2 and express the PGI2 receptor, IP, at various stages of myogenesis. Using genetic and pharmacological approaches, we show that PGI2 is a negative regulator of myoblast migration that also enhances cell fusion. Thus, PGI2 may act as a ""brake"" on migrating cells to facilitate cell-cell contact and fusion. Together, our results highlight the importance of the balance between positive and negative regulators in cell migration and myogenesis. This work may have implications for migration of other populations of adult stem cells and/or cells that undergo fusion."

Carriers of an intact NEDD4L C2-domain, encoded by the NEDD4L rs4149601 (G/A) GG genotype, together with the C-allele of the NEDD4L rs2288774 (C/T) polymorphism have previously been shown to have increased blood pressure. Our aim was to test if genetic variation in NEDD4L is associated with increased salt sensitivity. Methods 39 normotensive subjects were studied. The difference in 24-hour systolic blood pressure after four weeks on 150 mmol/day NaCl intake and four weeks on 50 mmol/day NaCl was defined as salt sensitivity. The rs4149601 and rs2288774 polymorphisms were genotyped using PCR-based techniques. Results Carriers of the rs4149601 GG-genotype together with the rs2288774 CC-genotype had significantly higher salt sensitivity (median, IQR) (18.0, 7.5–20.0 mmHg vs 6.0, 0.0–10.0 mmHg, P = 0.007) and lower plasma renin concentration (P-renin) (6.0, 2.0–9.5 mU/L vs 15.0, 9.0–24.0 mU/L, P = 0.005) as compared to non-carriers of these genotypes. In carriers of the rs4149601 GG-genotype together with the rs2288774 CC- or CT-genotype, as compared to non-carriers, salt sensitivity was (8.0, 6.0–18.0 mmHg vs 5.0, 0.0–10.0 mmHg, P = 0.07) and P-renin (9.0, 6.0–16.0 mU/L vs 15.0, 9.0–28.0 mU/L, P = 0.03). Conclusion Genetic NEDD4L variation seems to affect salt sensitivity and P-renin in normotensive subjects, suggesting that genotyping of NEDD4L may be clinically useful in order to identify subjects who benefit from dietary salt restriction in the prevention of hypertension."

Cell. 2003; 115: 355-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Most, if not all, of these processes involve ubiquitin or its close relations. ERAD is a quality control process whereby incorrectly folded or obsolete proteins in the ER are retrotranslocated through channels in the ER membrane, polyubiquitinated, and dismantled by the proteasome. Regulated ubiquitin-dependent processing employs the proteasome in more specific protein cleavage events, recognizing monoubiquitin signals on membrane-bound transcription factors and severing them from the membrane thereby activating transcription. Despite extensive biochemical and genetics characterization, structural information on the UN complex is only now coming together piecemeal. Ufd1 is a 34.5-kDa protein that was discovered in a yeast screen for mutants that failed to degrade a model ubiquitinated substrate (13Johnson E.S. Ma P.C.M. Ota I.M. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17442-17456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). The solution structure of Ufd1 residues 1-208 has been solved (14Park S. Isaacson R. Kim H.T.

Structure (Lond.). 2005; 13: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and bears remarkable similarities to the p97 N domain structure (double Ψ-β barrel). Ufd1 contains discrete binding sites for mono- and tetraubiquitin on different surfaces of the molecule. This has implications for the differential signaling roles of mono- and tetraubiquitin in cellular processes. There is currently no structural information for the C-terminal portion of Ufd1 (residues 209-307) and, although it encompasses binding sites for both Npl4 (residues 258-275) and p97 (residues 215-241) (15Bruderer R.M.

Although, most of Npl4 has evaded structure determination, a ubiquitin-like domain (UBD) was identified by sequence alignment techniques and shown to bind p97 N in pull-down assays (15Bruderer R.M. Brasseur C. Meyer H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49609-49616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Results from biochemical data compared the mode of binding of UN to p97 with that of the other extensively characterized adaptor p47, which recruits p97 for homotypic membrane fusion events in a variety of different cellular processes (17Kondo H. Rabouille C. Newman R. Levine T.P. Pappin D. Freemont P. Warren G. Nature. 1997; 388: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). UN and p47 compete for the same binding site on p97 N domain and, despite no sequence identity, appear to use very similar binding modes (15Bruderer R.M. Brasseur C. Meyer H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49609-49616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Both p47 and UN contain two binding sites for p97 N that permit a range of p97 hexamer:adaptor stoichiometries between 1:1 and 1:6. Cumulative evidence from electron microscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry, gel filtration, and mass spectrometry experiments now ascertains that either three p47 molecules or one UN complex bind to the p97 hexamer (18Pye V.E.

Uniformly deuterated samples of Npl4 or Ufd1 were prepared by expression in the appropriate Spectra9 media (Spectra Gases Ltd.). NMR Spectroscopy and Structure Calculation for Npl4 UBD—Backbone and side-chain assignment were completed using standard double- and triple-resonance assignment methodology (22Sattler M.

Three-dimensional 1H-15N/13C NOESY-heteronuclear single-quantum coherence (HSQC) (mixing time 100 ms at 500 and 800 MHz) experiments provided the distance restraints used in the final structure calculation. A total of 42 long range NOEs, providing unambiguous three-dimensional characterization of the fold for Npl4 UBD, were manually assigned from the NOESY data. The ARIA protocol (23Linge J.P. Habeck M. Rieping W. Nilges M. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 315-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) was used for augmentation of the NOE assignment and final structure calculation. Using the initial model as the starting structure in the first iteration, a total of 750 NOE-derived distances were assigned from 13C- and 15N-edited spectra. Dihedral angle restraints derived from TALOS were also implemented (24Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar). The frequency window tolerance for assigning NOEs was ±0.05 and ±0.07 ppm for direct and indirect proton dimensions and ±0.7 and ±1.2 ppm for nitrogen and carbon dimensions, respectively. The ARIA parameters were set to default values with the exception of the violation tolerances, which were set to 1.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.2, 0.1, 0.3, 0.1, 0.0, and 0.0 Å in the nine iterations. NMR Titrations—Samples of p97 N, Npl4 UBD, UN, or Ufd1 peptide were concentrated to 50 μm in 25 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, and 125 mm NaCl. Spectra were recorded in the absence and presence of the binding partner in appropriate molar ratios. For the p97 N-Npl4 UBD interaction, the molar ratios were 1:0.2, 1:0.5, 1:0.75, 1:1.3, 1:2, 1:2.4, 1:2.8, 1:3.9, and 1:6. All resolved shift changes were monitored by two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectra and fitted to a single binding site saturation isotherm within Excel (Microsoft Corp.). For the other titrations, the following molar ratios were used: p97 N:Ufd1 peptide, 1:1, 1:20, 1:50, and 1:100; ufd1 peptide + p97 N, 1:0.5, 1:1, 1:2, and 1:5; UN + p97 ND1, 1:0.5, 1:1, and 1:1.5. Structure Calculation for Npl4 UBD-p97 N Complex—The chemical shift perturbation studies delineated clear interaction surface areas in the p97 N-Npl4 UBD complex, making this highly suitable for structure calculation using the HADDOCK approach (25Dominguez C. Boelens R. Bonvin A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 1731-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2217) Google Scholar). For the calculation, the crystal structure of p97 N and the lowest energy NMR structure from the family of Npl4 UBD structures were used. 32 amino acid residues in Npl4 UBD and 58 in p97 N were identified to have weighted chemical shift changes significantly greater than the average: 0.253 ppm in Npl4 UBD and 0.186 ppm in p97 N were chosen as suitable cut-off values. After filtering for a relative solvent accessibility greater than 50%, as calculated using the program Naccess, 3S. J. Hubbard and J. M. Thornton, personal communication. 12 residues in Npl4 UBD (4, 8, 16, 17, 21, 50, 51, 69, 70, 71, 74, 77) and 16 for p97 N (50, 52, 54, 107, 109, 110, 112, 113, 133, 140, 141, 142, 156, 166, 171, 179) were identified as active residues. Residues juxtaposed to these that have a relative solvent accessibility greater than 50% were termed passive residues. These included 11 further residues in Npl4 UBD (2, 3, 12, 14, 15, 23, 39, 52, 53, 68, 72) and 16 in p97 N (23, 43, 47, 48, 53, 106, 126, 131, 155, 157, 158, 169, 178, 181, 182, 191). An ambiguous distance restraint of 3.0 Å was invoked between all active residues in one partner molecule to any atom within the active and passive residues of the other protein partner. The interfacial residues that were allowed to move during the simulated annealing and water refinement were residues 12-21 and 31-43 for Npl4 UBD and 44-52 and 65-76 for p97 N. One thousand initial complex structures were generated by rigid body energy minimization, and the best 200 by total energy were selected for torsion angle dynamics and subsequent Cartesian dynamics in an explicit water solvent. Default scaling for energy terms was applied as described previously (25Dominguez C. Boelens R. Bonvin A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 1731-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2217) Google Scholar). Npl4 has, thus far, evaded structure determination largely because of its intrinsic flexibility and instability in the absence of Ufd1 (NMR data not shown). Fig. 1 shows a 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of the entire 100-kDa UN complex in which Npl4 is isotopically 15N labeled. Only peaks corresponding to the UBD and NZF domains have favorable relaxation properties and are therefore visible in HSQC spectra, indicating that these domains, at the N and C termini of Npl4, exhibit some degree of independence. The chemical shifts for amides from these domains are unchanged when compared with the individual fragments, suggesting that their structures are identical. The predicted UBD of Npl4, comprising residues 1-96 of the full-length protein, was produced recombinantly with isotopic labeling in Escherichia coli. Although the battery of NMR spectra obtained from this protein typified a compact folded domain, a significant number of backbone amide resonances were broad or missing from the data. Varying pH, buffer, and temperature conditions failed to recover the absent peaks. Following backbone assignment (Fig. 1A), it became clear that these data corresponded to a contiguous stretch of the protein sequence (residues 60-68), implying a potentially interesting region exhibiting intermediate conformational exchange. Furthermore, residues 80-96 were completely unstructured based on their amide relaxation properties (data not shown), comparison with random coil chemical shifts, and the absence of interresidue NOEs in NOESY spectra. Although NOE data were not available for these regions, it was possible to calculate a solution structure for the majority of the domain (Fig. 2 and Table 1). The secondary structure occupies a core ββαβαβ topology and manual assignment of key NOEs revealed a β-grasp-like fold with similarities to ubiquitin. An initial β-grasp fold model for Npl4 UBD was used as a starting structure in an automatic NOE assignment using the ARIA protocol (23Linge J.P. Habeck M. Rieping W. Nilges M. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 315-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). All areas of identified secondary structure are well defined (Fig. 2A); the average pairwise root mean squared deviation (r.m.s.d.) for the water-refined final family of structures is 0.88 Å for the backbone atoms of secondary structure elements. The experimentally determined secondary structure of Npl4 UBD consists of two helices (α1 between Ala-26-Phe-37 and a 310 (α2) between Arg-50-Glu-55) and four β-strands (β1, Ile-5-Gln-10; β2, Val-15-Ala-20; β3, Tyr-47-Ile-48; β4, Leu-74-Phe-76) assembled in a β-grasp-like fold (Fig. 2B). The β-strands form a mixed sheet in a 2-1-4-3 arrangement where 2-1 and 4-3 adopt anti-parallel pairing and 1 and 4 are parallel to each other. Fig. 2, C and D, show superimposition of Npl4 UBD with structures identified as having the most similar topology: ubiquitin (11% identity and r.m.s.d. 2.7 Å over 56 residues) and the β-grasp protein from Arabidopsis thaliana (PDB accession code: 1WF9; 20% identity, and r.m.s.d. 2.7 Å over 61 residues), respectively. These structural homologues provide hints as to the structure of the missing region from Npl4 UBD. In all UBD structures solved to date, this region corresponds to a long loop region containing a short α-helix. Fig. 2E shows a structure-based sequence alignment of Npl4 UBD, ubiquitin, p47 UBX, and the β-grasp protein from Arabidopsis (1WF9) with conserved residues highlighted.TABLE 1Structural statistics for Npl4 UBD domain solution structure calculationNpl4 UBD (PDB: 2PJH)Number of experimental restraints716Total NOE-derived630Ambiguous119Unambiguous511Talos (ϕ/ψ)86r.m.s.d. from experimental restraintsDistance (Å)0.05 ± 0.005Dihedral angle (deg.)0.9 ± 0.1r.m.s.d. from idealized covalent geometryBonds (Å)0.0041 ± 0.0002Angles (deg.)0.56 ± 0.02Coordinate r.m.s.d.

Fig. 3A shows a comparison of the 1H-15N HSQC spectra of uniformly 15N-labeled Npl4 UBD in the presence and absence of p97 N. Twenty-two significantly perturbed residues were observed, whereas most of the spectrum remained unchanged, indicating the formation of a specific complex between the two proteins. Fig. 3A highlights some of the more prominent shifts and includes multiple increments from the titration, demonstrating that binding is within the fast-exchange limits of the NMR time scale. Changes in chemical shift measured with increasing peptide concentration were fitted to a standard single binding site saturation isotherm yielding an estimated Kd in the range of 10-100 μm. Mapping the perturbed residues onto the structure of Npl4 UBD delineated the binding surface, which spans the exposed face of the β-sheet and neighboring loop regions with key shifted residues congregating on β1 and β3 (Fig. 3B). The structure of the p97 N domain is known from x-ray crystallographic studies on the larger p97 ND1 construct (2Zhang X.D. Shaw A. Bates P.A. Newman R.H. Gowen B. Orlova E. Gorman M.A. Kondo H. Dokurmo P. Lally J. Leonard G. Meyer H.E. van Heel M. Freemont P.S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1473-1484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Using a standard triple resonance NMR approach, we assigned the backbone amide resonances of the 24-kDa fragment and identified which residues participate in binding to the UBD domain of Npl4. 1H-15N HSQC spectra of uniformly 15N-labeled p97 were recorded in the presence and absence of Npl4 UBD (Fig. 4C). In this case, 35 out of a possible 213 residues were significantly perturbed, and the binding surface maps to the negatively charged groove between the two subdomains of p97 N (Nn and Nc) (Fig. 4B). Prominent sites of interaction occur in the loops between β1 and β3, β7 and β8, β12 and β13 and the long loop between β6 and β7 that connects the Nn and Nc subdomains of p97 N. The clear delineation of a binding interface using chemical shift mapping has enabled us to adopt an NMR restraint-guided docking approach (HADDOCK) (25Dominguez C. Boelens R. Bonvin A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 1731-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2217) Google Scholar) to generate a structural model for the complex. The stoichiometry of the UN-full-length p97 has been previously established by electron microscopy, mass spectrometry, and gel filtration in which one UN heterodimer binds one p97 hexamer (18Pye V.E. Beuron F. Keetch C.A. McKeown C. Robinson C.V. Meyer H.H. Zhang X.D. Freemont P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), thus inferring a 1:1 stoichiometry for the p97 N:UBD interaction. Furthermore, chemical shift movements fit well to a single binding site isotherm. Standard ambiguous interaction restraints between Npl4 UBD and p97 N, based on residues experiencing greater than average NMR chemical shift perturbations, were used to drive the calculation (see “Experimental Procedures”). The 200 final refined structures for the p97 N-Npl4 UBD complex were clustered according to a pairwise r.m.s.d. cut-off of 2.5 Å, producing two major clusters of 14 and 18 structures. The average intermolecular energy for the best cluster was -555 ± 55 kcal mol-1. Fig. 5A shows an overlay of the 10 lowest interactional energy, water-refined structures from the low energy cluster. As suggested by the chemical shift mapping data, the model shows the Npl4 UBD binding within the groove formed between the two subdomains of p97 N, in an analogous fashion to p47 UBX domain binding (Fig. 5, B and C). This interface differs from p47 in that the S3-S4 region in Npl4 UBD is elaborated with a 310 helix (Fig. 5D) that provides specific contacts to p97 N. Also highlighted in Fig. 5D are 3 critical residues in Npl4 UBD that project into the hydrophobic binding pocket with p97 N: Val-15, Leu-74, and Phe-76 (which contact Lys-109, Gly-54, and Tyr-143 in p97 N, respectively). In alignment with p47, these amino acids equate to Arg-307, Val-366, and Arg-368, all of which make the corresponding p97 contacts and are seen to shift in the earlier NMR study. To assess whether our structural model for Npl4 UBD-p97 N represents the likely mode of interaction within the UN heterodimer-p97 hexamer complex, we performed a TROSY- and CRINEPT-based NMR titration of 300-kDa hexameric p97 ND1 into full-length 100-kDa UN, in which Npl4 is uniformly 2H,15N-labeled and Ufd1 is unlabeled. Interestingly, the 2H-15N TROSY spectrum of free UN revealed a 40-50-kDa structured core domain within Npl4, in addition to the terminal UBD and ZF domains, which folds upon interaction with Ufd1 (Fig. 3A, right). In CRINEPT and TROSY spectra of the 1:1 UN:p97 ND1 hexamer complex, a number of UBD resonances disappear, whereas the rest of the spectrum remains largely unchanged (Fig. 3A, right). These peaks correspond exactly to the UBD-p97 N interface identified in our chemical shift mapping experiments, and their absence is probably due to the faster relaxation properties exhibited when bound to the protonated 300-kDa p97 hexamer. The observation of peaks from the core domain and ZF in the TROSY spectrum of this 400-kDa complex suggests that they exhibit a degree of independence from the hexameric unit. The portion of Ufd1 that binds to p97 N has been localized to a region spanning residues 215-241 (15Bruderer R.M. Brasseur C. Meyer H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49609-49616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This sequence displays some limited identity with a stretch of amino acids in p47, known to bind p97 N, which occurs in the linker region between the p47 UBX and SEP domains. To localize further the interacting region within Ufd1, we synthesized a specifically labeled peptide in which a selection of 15N/13C-labeled amino acids were incorporated throughout the sequence (i.e. labels in bold and underlined DHSGYAGEVGFRAFSGSGNRLDGKKKG). 1H-15N and 1H-13C HSQC spectra of the peptide were recorded in the presence of increasing amounts of p97 N. Gly-224, Ala-227, and Gly-230 resonances were severely broadened upon interaction with p97 N (Fig. 6A), whereas the remaining resonances were unaffected. The residues displaying broadened NMR signals delineate the p97 N-binding site, and line broadening is likely caused by the peptide exhibiting conformational exchange on the ms-μs time scale within the complex. Building on our previous experiments, we also titrated an unlabeled peptide into 15N-labeled p97 N to observe its binding interface. Fig. 4C shows the HSQC spectra of uniformly 15N-labeled p97 N in the presence and absence of Ufd1 peptide. Surprisingly, we discovered that some of the 24 p97 N residues perturbed upon Ufd1 peptide addition fall within the binding interface between p97 N and Npl4 UBD (Fig. 4, A and B), implying that a degree of communication may exist in binding these two motifs. We also performed a competition experiment in which p97 N was saturated with Ufd1 peptide and then titrated with increasing amounts of Npl4 UBD. All chemical shift movements caused by the Ufd1 peptides are reversed after a saturating titer of Npl4 UBD has been added (Fig. 4C). Together, Npl4 and Ufd1 recruit p97 to specific ubiquitin-related cellular processes. We provide the first structural characterization of this interaction at a molecular level. Npl4 and Ufd1 each contain a region that contacts p97 N, and these sites resemble functionally the two regions in p47, another p97 adaptor protein. The Npl4-binding site for p97 N occurs in the N-terminal UBD domain, which exhibits a novel β-grasp-like fold. Using chemical shift perturbation studies, we delineated the region on Npl4 UBD that binds to p97 N. This surface is reminiscent of the Ile-44 face hydrophobic patch on ubiquitin that represents the binding site for many of its cohorts. Interestingly, the region of Npl4 UBD that is in severe intermediate conformational exchange (residues 60-68) lies outside the p97-binding surface identified by the HADDOCK calculation, implying that the missing data are not a consequence of the p97 N-binding site. Furthermore, resonances from this region remain conformationally broadened even in the presence of saturating amounts of p97 N. This area might represent a site of association with part of Ufd1 or another region from full-length Npl4 since the UBD represents approximately one-sixth of the whole protein. This is consistent with NMR observations suggesting that the UBD domain is not tumbling entirely independently from the main body of the UN complex. We identified the reciprocal UBD-binding surface on p97 N domain, which is located in the cleft between the Nn and Nc subdomains. Strikingly, this Npl4 UBD-binding area encompasses the p97 N domain amino acids (Arg-93, Arg-95, and Arg-155) found missense-mutated in hereditary inclusion body myopathy with Paget disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD) (27Weihl C.C. Dalal S. Pestronk A. Hanson P.I. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Arg-93 is a shifted residue in our NMR titration experiments with UN and p97 N, and Arg-155 is directly adjacent to a shifted residue. Weihl et al. 27 have shown that p97 bearing the most common IBMPFD mutation, R155H, retains its usual hexameric structure and ATPase activity yet exhibits impaired ERAD function (27Weihl C.C. Dalal S. Pestronk A. Hanson P.I. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Our findings suggest that this is probably a result of inhibited or modified binding to the UN complex. Yuan et al. (28Yuan X.M. Shaw A. Zhang X.D. Kondo H. Lally J. Freemont P.S. Matthews S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) mapped the p97 N-binding surface on p47 in a chemical shift perturbation study yielding data directly comparable with ours. Dreveny et al. (20Dreveny I. Kondo H. Uchiyama K. Shaw A. Zhang X.D. Freemont P.S. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1030-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) expanded this information by solving a crystal structure of the complex between p47 and p97 and illustrated the importance of the S3-S4 loop within p47 as a key point of interaction with the cleft of p97 N. They showed that the analogous loop from ubiquitin did not provide the necessary contacts for high affinity binding. The information we gained from mapping both binding surfaces allowed us to generate a model for the complex of Npl4 UBD and p97 N. We also demonstrate, using NMR, that this mode of interaction exists in the full-length UN in complex with hexameric p97. Our model also reveals striking similarities to the crystal complex of p47 with p97 N, with the key p97 N-interacting residues in Npl4 UBD aligning structurally with the corresponding residues in p47. Although Npl4 UBD resembles ubiquitin rather than p47 in the length of its S3-S4 loop and overall structure, mutagenesis data confirm the importance of this region (15Bruderer R.M. Brasseur C. Meyer H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49609-49616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Fig. 5E illustrates the key locations of these mutated residues within the protein-protein interface of the UBD-p97 N complex. Our model reveals that although these residues play a role in the interface, they lie proximal to the main region of interaction. The S3-S4 region in Npl4 is decorated with a 310 helix distinguishing it from both p47 and ubiquitin and suggesting a mechanism for specificity between the two p97 adaptors. Despite dramatic variations in sequence, many of the known p97 adaptor proteins, including p37, p47, Ubx2, VCIP135, Faf1, and Saks1, bind to the N domain via ubiquitin-like motifs (29Hartmann-Petersen R.

J. 2004; 384: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). There are likely to be substantial parallels between the binding modes of these domains to p97 N. Comparing the published p47 data with the UN data presented here, we can speculate that these ubiquitin-like domains recognize the p97 N cleft using similar, yet subtly different, interaction modes. Electron microscopy and stoichiometric studies by Pye et al. (18Pye V.E. Beuron F. Keetch C.A. McKeown C. Robinson C.V. Meyer H.H. Zhang X.D. Freemont P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) assign these to macroscopic differences in organization since, despite our discovery of analogous residue interactions at the binding interface, a p47 trimer appears to straddle the p97 hexamer, whereas a single UN complex projects from one side. Upon examining the interaction between Ufd1 and p97 N, our NMR data suggest that the p97 N-binding region in Ufd1 can be localized to a short region encompassing Gly-224, Ala-227, and Gly-230. The phenylalanine, alanine, and glycine residues within this stretch are highly conserved (Fig. 6B) and expected to make key interactions with p97 N. Surprisingly, chemical shift perturbations induced in p97 N spectra in the presence of Ufd1 are reversed upon the addition the UBD. Although it may be difficult to extrapolate data on a small peptide motif to the native system, it suggests a degree of communication between the Npl4- and Ufd1-binding sites on p97. Although low resolution electron microscopy data indicate that the UN complex associates with one N domain of p97, as the authors suggest, this may represent a snapshot in a process of mechanical rearrangements associated with UN binding to the p97 hexamer during activity (18Pye V.E. Beuron F. Keetch C.A. McKeown C. Robinson C.V. Meyer H.H. Zhang X.D. Freemont P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Bearing in mind the inherent flexibility of the UN complex and potential interplay between the Ufd1- and Npl4-binding sites, it is also plausible that the UN complex spans two adjacent N domains. Bruderer et al. (15Bruderer R.M. Brasseur C. Meyer H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49609-49616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) drew biochemical parallels between p47 binding to p97 N via two interaction points (in its UBX domain and in the linker to SEP) and UN binding through the structurally analogous regions in Npl4 UBD and Ufd1 peptide. Evidence implies that the p47 bipartite binding site can span two N domains, as p47 binds p97 as a trimer presenting two adjacent N domains per p47 molecule (19Beuron F. Dreveny I. Yuan X.M. Pye V.E. McKeown C. Briggs L.C. Cliff M.J. Kaneko Y. Wallis R. Isaacson R.L. Ladbury J.E. Matthews S.J. Kondo H. Zhang X.D. Freemont P.S.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1030-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The bipartite motif is also conserved in p37, a novel adaptor of p97 that is required for Golgi and ER biogenesis (33Uchiyama K. Totsukawa G. Puhka M. Kaneko Y. Jokitalo E. Dreveny I. Beuron F. Zhang X.D. Freemont P. Kondo H. Dev. Cell. 2006; 11: 803-816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The subtle differences presented in the UBD-p97 N interaction and the stark difference in their connectivities to the second binding site, i.e. covalently in the case of p47/p37 and non-covalently in UN, provide scope for varied modes of p97-mediated adaptor binding and activity. It is conceivable that conformational changes in p97 N, induced by nucleotide binding/hydrolysis or UN binding, could facilitate a mechanism for the bipartite binding motif to alter their arrangement within the p97 hexamer and propagate signals to the substrate. Furthermore, alterations in N domain accessibility may prime them to receive new co-adaptors, for example, Ufd2 or Ufd3."
https://openalex.org/W1981692280,"Members of the genus Pneumocystis are fungal pathogens that cause pneumonia in a wide variety of mammals with debilitated immune systems. Little is known about their basic biological functions, including life cycle, since no species can be cultured continuously outside the mammalian lung. To better understand the pathological process, about 4500 ESTS derived from sequencing of the poly(A) tail ends of P. carinii mRNAs during fulminate infection were annotated and functionally characterized as unassembled reads, and then clustered and reduced to a unigene set with 1042 members. Because of the presence of sequences from other microbial genomes and the rat host, the analysis and compression to a unigene set was necessarily an iterative process. BLASTx analysis of the unassembled reads (UR) vs. the Uni-Prot and TREMBL databases revealed 56% had similarities to existing polypeptides at E values of<or=10(-6), with the remainder lacking any significant homology. The most abundant transcripts in the UR were associated with stress responses, energy production, transcription and translation. Most (70%) of the UR had similarities to proteins from filamentous fungi (e.g., Aspergillus, Neurospora) and existing P. carinii gene products. In contrast, similarities to proteins of the yeast-like fungi, Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, predominated in the unigene set. Gene Ontology analysis using BLAST2GO revealed P. carinii dedicated most of its transcripts to cellular and physiological processes ( approximately 80%), molecular binding and catalytic activities (approximately 70%), and were primarily derived from cell and organellar compartments (approximately 80%). KEGG Pathway mapping showed the putative P. carinii genes represented most standard metabolic pathways and cellular processes, including the tricarboxylic acid cycle, glycolysis, amino acid biosynthesis, cell cycle and mitochondrial function. Several gene homologs associated with mating, meiosis, and sterol biosynthesis in fungi were identified. Genes encoding the major surface glycoprotein family (MSG), heat shock (HSP70), and proteases (PROT/KEX) were the most abundantly expressed of known P. carinii genes. The apparent presence of many metabolic pathways in P. carinii, sexual reproduction within the host, and lack of an invasive infection process in the immunologically intact host suggest members of the genus Pneumocystis may be adapted parasites and have a compatible relationship with their mammalian hosts. This study represents the first characterization of the expressed genes of a non-culturable fungal pathogen of mammals during the infective process."

Protein S-nitrosylation, or the formation of an S–NO bond involving the sulfur of a cysteine residue, is an important post-translational modification. Numerous proteins whose functions are altered by S-nitrosylation have been identified, including enzymes, transcription factors, receptors, channels, and structural proteins (reviewed in Ref. 1Hess D.T. Matsumoto A. Kim S.O. Marshall H.E. Stamler J.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 150-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar). Parallels have been drawn between S-nitrosylation and O-phosphorylation, a ubiquitous biological signal (2Lane P. Hao G. Gross S.S. Science's STKE. 2001; : RE1PubMed Google Scholar, 3Mannick J.B. Schonhoff C.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 408: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Regulation of the function of many proteins by O-phosphorylation is a consequence of structural changes that take place in the protein following phosphorylation. The molecular consequences of protein S-nitrosylation are less well characterized. Enzymes such as caspases that require a cysteine thiol in the active site can be modulated in their activity by S-nitrosylation, which alters the reactive properties of the cysteine (4Mannick J.B. Schonhoff C. Papeta N. Ghafourifar P. Szibor M. Fang K. Gaston B. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 1111-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). S-Nitrosylation can also influence protein-protein interactions, as recently demonstrated with yeast two-hybrid screening (5Matsumoto A. Comatas K.E. Liu L. Stamler J.S. Science. 2003; 301: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Finally, S-nitrosylation may have the ability to modulate the function of a protein via allosteric changes in its structure. Although this mechanism has been hypothesized for several systems, there has thus far been little structural evidence published (6Kim S.O. Merchant K. Nudelman R. Beyer Jr., W.F. Keng T. DeAngelo J.

A. 2003; 100: 6376-6381Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Another critical role for NO in cell physiology involves its interaction with heme proteins. The first well defined mechanism for a NO-dependent physiological effect was the relaxation of vascular smooth muscle following the binding of NO to the heme iron of guanylate cyclase, which activates this enzyme to convert guanosine triphosphate to the second messenger cGMP (8Denninger J.W. Marletta M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 334-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). The reaction of the NO group (NO, NO+, NO-) with heme and thiol is complex (9Williams D.L.H. Nitrosation Reactions and the Chemistry of Nitric Oxide. Elsevier Science, Oxford2004Google Scholar). However, under various in vitro and in vivo conditions, the NO group is capable of binding at one or the other or exchanging between the two. It has been shown that the bioavailability of NO when bound to Cysβ93 of hemoglobin is dependent upon blood O2 concentration as well as the allosteric and redox state and that it acts as an important regulator of vessel tone and blood flow (10Gow A.J.

It has been suggested that this reactive -SH plays a role in S-nitrosylation in vivo (16Marcinek D.J. Bonaventura J. Wittenberg J.B. Block B.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: R1123-R1133Google Scholar), although there are no hard data yet to support this hypothesis. With the recent advancement in methodologies for the detection and identification of S-nitrosylated proteins in cell culture and tissue samples, such as the S-nitrosylation site identification (17Hao G.

Science's STKE. 2001; : PL1PubMed Google Scholar), an extensive data base of S-nitrosylation sites within proteins is being accumulated. In light of these advancements, a more detailed knowledge of the structural consequences of this modification will be critical for understanding the molecular mechanisms by which S-nitrosylation alters protein function. In this work, we have demonstrated with atomic resolution the effects of S-nitrosylation on the x-ray crystal structure of blackfin tuna myoglobin. In addition, we have identified conformational changes in this protein that are the direct result of the formation of the S-nitrosothiol group. We also demonstrate that, upon reduction with dithionite, the NO group is transferred from the surface-exposed Cys-10 to the reduced heme iron, showing the reversibility of the S–NO modification and the conformational changes. Finally, we have provided the first atomic resolution structure of nitric oxide bound to the heme iron of a globin protein, which allows the calculation of accurate geometric parameters for this important coordination complex. Purification of Myoglobin from Blackfin Tuna—Myoglobin was purified from the red muscle of blackfin tuna (Thunnus atlanticus) caught near Rincón, Puerto Rico. The red muscle was dissected, homogenized, and centrifuged, and myoglobin was precipitated from the supernatant between 65 and 95% ammonium sulfate. Following resuspension of the precipitated myoglobin and dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline, the protein was separated by size exclusion chromatography on a Sephadex G-75 column. Myoglobin-containing fractions were concentrated to ∼1.2 mm and stored at -80 °C. Myoglobin isolated by this method was nearly 100% ferric aquo (met)myoglobin as judged by UV-visible spectroscopy. Trans-S-nitrosylation of Myoglobin—Purified myoglobin was S-nitrosylated by reaction of 300 μm myoglobin with 3 mm S-nitrosocysteine in borax buffer containing 500 μm diethylene-triamine pentaacetate at pH 9. S-Nitrosocysteine was removed by passing the sample through two sequential Micro Bio-Spin 6 size exclusion columns (Bio-Rad). The amount of S-nitrosylation in purified myoglobin samples was quantitated using the Saville (20Saville B. Analyst. 1958; 83: 670Crossref Google Scholar) and Griess (21Greiss J.P. Chem. Ber. 1879; 12: 426Crossref Scopus (729) Google Scholar) reactions in acidified aqueous solution as described previously (22Nims R.W. Darbyshire J.F. Saavedra J.E. Christodoulou D. Hanbauer I.

A calibration curve was generated for this assay using S-nitrosoglutathione, which was quantitated using an extinction coefficient of 767 m-1 cm-1 at 337 nm (25Mathews W.R. Kerr S.W. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1993; 267: 1529-1537PubMed Google Scholar). A chemiluminescence nitric oxide analyzer (Sievers) was also used to verify production of S-nitrosylated myoglobin, again using S-nitrosoglutathione or S-nitrosocysteine for calibration. Crystallization and Data Collection—Purified myoglobin, at a concentration of 1.2 mm in phosphate-buffered saline, was crystallized by hanging-drop vapor diffusion at room temperature by mixing 2 μl of protein solution with 2 μl of a precipitant solution containing 0.2 m potassium/sodium tartrate, 0.1 m sodium citrate (pH 5.6), and 2.0 m ammonium sulfate. Crystals grew as clusters of large plates in 2–7 days. Crystals were cryoprotected by soaking for 30 s in the precipitant solution containing either 30% ethylene glycol or 30% glycerol and rapidly cooled to 100 K in a gaseous nitrogen stream for data collection. Crystals of Mb–SNO were grown and cryoprotected in the same way as unmodified myoglobin. Crystals of ferrous nitrosyl myoglobin were prepared by soaking of metmyoglobin crystals in deoxygenated precipitant solution containing 2.2 m ammonium sulfate, 0.2 m potassium/sodium tartrate, 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5.6, and 20 mm sodium dithionite for 20 min followed by anaerobic transfer to precipitant solution supplemented with 3 mm nitric oxide donor 2-(N,N-diethylamino)-diazenolate-2-oxide (kindly supplied by Dr. Katrina Miranda). After 10 min, the crystals were quickly transferred to 3.5 m ammonium sulfate, 0.16 m potassium/sodium tartrate, 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5.6, and flash-frozen in liquid N2. Data were collected either on a rotating copper anode home x-ray source equipped with a Saturn 92 CCD detector (Rigaku/Molecular Structure Corporation) or at the Advanced Photon Source synchrotron beamlines indicated in Table 1.

Przybylska M. Rose D.R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The structure was rebuilt and refined using Coot (30Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23387) Google Scholar) and Ref-mac5 programs within the CCP4 suite (31Collaborative Computational ProjectActa Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19769) Google Scholar), respectively. Although the amino acid sequence of blackfin tuna myoglobin is not available in any data bases, the sequence was tentatively assigned based on the excellent quality electron density maps and appears to be identical to bluefin and bigeye tuna myoglobins, except for a His → Gln substitution at position 112, which is also present in other tuna species. Positive difference electron density at the N terminus was modeled as an N-acetyl group, given that this modification is known to occur in myoglobins from other tuna species (32Watts D.A. Rice R.H. Brown W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10916-10924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Electron density at position 10 in crystals of myoglobin trans-S-nitrosylated with S-nitrosocysteine was interpreted as two conformations of Cys S–NO (Fig. 1, A and B) and one conformation of unmodified Cys-10 (Fig. 1C). Geometric restraints for the refinement of the Cys-10 S–NO group were generated based on a small molecule crystal structure of S-nitroso-l-cysteine ethyl ester (33Yi J. Khan M.A. Lee J. Richter-Addo G.B. Nitric Oxide. 2005; 12: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). For the ferrous nitrosyl myoglobin structure, no restraints were placed on the Fe–NO bond lengths or angles during the final stages of refinement. During the later stages of refinement of the atomic resolution Mb structures, anisotropic B-factors were refined for all atoms, and hydrogens were added in their riding positions. Refinement statistics are provided in Table 1. Structure of Blackfin Tuna Myoglobin—The structure of myoglobin isolated from blackfin tuna was determined to 0.91 Å resolution by molecular replacement. The overall structure is very similar to that of myoglobins from other species, especially yellowfin tuna (29Birnbaum G.I. Evans S.V. Przybylska M. Rose D.R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and will not be discussed further here. Detailed descriptions of various heme oxidation and ligation states of blackfin tuna myoglobin from high-resolution crystal structures will be published separately. Generation and Stability of S-Nitrosomyoglobin—Blackfin tuna myoglobin was successfully S-nitrosylated at Cys-10 via reaction with excess S-nitrosocysteine or S-nitrosoglutathione. Although the characteristic absorption band indicative of S-nitrosothiols at ∼330 nm (extinction coefficient ∼600–800 m-1 cm-1) was masked by the much stronger heme absorption at that wavelength (extinction coefficient ∼20,000 m-1 cm-1), the presence of S-nitrosomyoglobin was confirmed using the Saville-Griess assay as well as chemiluminescence after extensive desalting of the sample to remove S-nitrosocysteine and free cysteine. Not all of the myoglobin Cys-10 was S-nitrosylated under these reaction conditions, with an average yield of 50–70% Mb S–NO. The amount of S-nitrosothiol in the S-nitrosomyoglobin sample did not decrease significantly over the course of a month at room temperature when stored in the dark in a metal ion-free buffer. Structure of S-Nitrosomyoglobin—Myoglobin trans-S-nitrosylated by reaction with excess S-nitrosocysteine crystallized in the same form as unmodified myoglobin. Data were collected to 1.09 Å resolution using a rotating copper anode x-ray generator. Attempts to collect data to higher resolution using a synchrotron source led to complete removal of the S–NO group. The x-ray sensitivity of protein S–NO groups has been observed in other systems as well (34Weichsel A. Brailey J.L. Montfort W.R. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1219-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Slight loss of the S–NO group was also observed using a rotating anode source when long exposure times were used; therefore, exposure times were minimized to prevent degradation of the S–NO. The electron density map around position 10 clearly indicated a chemical modification of the sulfur of Cys-10 as well as multiple conformations of the Cys-10 side chain (Fig. 1). The final model included three conformations of Cys-10, two that had been S-nitrosylated (Fig. 1, A and B), and one that remained unmodified (Fig. 1C). This interpretation gave the best fit to the electron density map and was only possible because of the high resolution of the data. The unmodified Cys-10 conformation closely matched that seen in the unmodified myoglobin structure, and was present at ∼30% occupancy. The ∼70% S-nitrosylation of Cys-10 observed in the crystal matched our synthetic yields of Mb–SNO formation in solution. The major conformation of S-nitrosylated Cys-10 (Fig. 1A) is rotated by only 25° around χ1 (rotation around the Cα–Cβ bond) from the unmodified rotamer (Fig. 1). The second modified conformation (Fig. 1B) has a substantially different χ1 rotamer, rotated by 115°, but the attached NO moiety occupied nearly the same space as that of conformation A. Both Cys-10 SNO conformations are present as the cis dihedral, with C–S–N–O dihedral angles (χ3) close to 0°. Structural Changes upon S-Nitrosylation—Superposition of the structure of S-nitrosylated myoglobin with the unmodified structure reveals that there are significant differences in several portions of the structure. The differences are primarily localized to the structural elements surrounding Cys-10, including helix A, the N terminus of helix H, loop EF, and loop GH (Fig. 2A). Comparison of the Cα traces of S-nitrosylated and unmodified myoglobin yielded a root mean square deviation value of 1.2 Å for portions of the structure surrounding Cys-10 (residues 1–10, 71–83, and 115–127, 34 Cα atoms), whereas the rest of the structure had a root mean square deviation of only 0.2 Å (residues 11–70, 84–114, and 128–146, 109 Cα atoms). The NO group of S-nitrosylated Cys-10 packs between the side chain of Leu-117 within loop GH and the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Ala-6 from helix A (Fig. 2B). Superposition of the unmodified myoglobin structure revealed that the S-nitrosothiol group could create steric clashes with Leu-117 and Ala-6 if these portions of the structure did not move. Although two conformations of S-nitrosylated Cys-10 exist in our structure, these observations hold true for both. Therefore, helix A and loop GH were forced in opposite directions, or wedged apart, as a direct consequence of S-nitrosylation at Cys-10. We also observed secondary effects of the movement of helix A. The N terminus of helix H, which was packed against helix A, shifted to occupy the void created by the movement of helix A. Additionally, loop EF was shifted away from helix A. Although loop EF exhibited both static and dynamic disorder in both structures and therefore appeared to be flexible, at least one static conformation of this loop in the unmodified structure was displaced by steric clashes created upon movement of helix A following S-nitrosylation. In contrast to the structural changes surrounding Cys-10 following S-nitrosylation, no significant changes were observed in the vicinity of the heme prosthetic group, the site of oxygen binding in myoglobin. NO Cleavage from Cys-10 and Rebinding to Reduced Heme—Following trans-S-nitrosylation with S-nitrosocysteine and desalting, a UV-visible absorption spectrum showed that the heme group of isolated blackfin tuna myoglobin remains in the ferric aquo (met) state (Fig. 3A, black spectrum). The addition of the reducing agent sodium dithionite to this sample resulted in a shift of the Soret and Q bands of the heme absorption spectrum to wavelengths indicative of the ferrous nitrosyl (FeII–NO) derivative (Fig. 3A, red spectrum). Spectral deconvolution indicated that 40% of the sample was converted to the ferrous nitrosyl form, 37% became unliganded ferrous deoxy, and 23% remained ferric met. Furthermore, the addition of dithionite to solutions of either S-nitro-glutathione or S-nitrocysteine resulted in the release of nitric oxide that could be detected by a chemiluminescence-based nitric oxide monitor. 3E. R. Schreiter, M. M. Rodríguez, A. Weichsel, W. R. Montfort, and J. Bonaventura, unpublished data. This leads us to conclude that, upon reaction of Mb–SNO with dithionite, the NO group is cleaved from the Cys-10 sulfur and can subsequently bind to the reduced heme iron. As expected, treatment of unmodified metmyoglobin with dithionite resulted in primarily the unliganded ferrous deoxy form of the heme (Fig. 3B). Spectral deconvolution showed 0% ferrous nitrosyl, 77% ferrous deoxy, and 23% ferric met. We were also able to observe this NO group transfer in two structures derived from a single crystal. Rapid data collection to minimize the x-ray dose on a crystal of S-nitrosomyoglobin produced a structure identical to that described earlier (Figs. 1 and 2), with Cys-10 modified by NO (Fig. 3C) and the heme in the ferric aquo state (Fig. 3D). Subsequent soaking of the same crystal in a solution containing 200 mm dithionite and the collection of another dataset showed that Cys-10 was no longer modified (Fig. 3E) and that the heme was primarily ligated by NO (Fig. 3F). This structure likely represents a mixture of the ferrous nitrosyl, ferrous deoxy, and ferric met forms observed upon dithionite reduction in solution, as described previously, with ferrous nitrosyl as the major species. Importantly, conformational changes observed in the structure after dithionite soaking show that the myoglobin reverts to the same conformation it had prior to S-nitrosylation. It is worth noting that this conformational change is accommodated within the context of a single crystal. We wish to make clear that the reactions of Mb–SNO with dithionite do not necessarily shed light on the chemistry that may take place in vivo. Dithionite was used in these studies as a means to demonstrate the reversibility of the S-nitrosylation of Mb at Cys-10 and was convenient for the rapid soaking of crystalline samples. Nonetheless, it is interesting to note that if a suitable reductant were present in vivo, the myoglobin heme would efficiently capture the released NO. Ultrahigh Resolution Structure of FeII–NO Myoglobin—Crystals of the FeII–NO form of blackfin tuna myoglobin were prepared by anaerobic reduction and treatment with the nitric oxide donor 2-(N,N-diethylamino)-diazenolate-2-oxide, and a dataset was collected to 0.95 Å resolution using synchrotron radiation. At this resolution, individual atoms of the heme-NO complex were resolved in the electron density map (Fig. 4), allowing highly accurate bond lengths and angles to be calculated. Geometrical parameters of the heme Fe–NO ligation from this structure are summarized in Table 2. The heme group was nearly planar, as demonstrated by the small distortion parameters in Table 2, calculated using normal coordinate structural decomposition calculations as described previously (35Jentzen W.

https://openalex.org/W2083348930,"Background It has been suggested that stress provokes neuropathological changes and may thus contribute to the precipitation of affective disorders such as depression. Likewise, the pharmacological therapy of depression requires chronic treatment and is thought to induce a positive neuronal adaptation, presumably based on changes in gene transcription. The transcription factor cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) and its binding site (CRE) have been suggested to play a major role in both the development of depression and antidepressive therapy. Methodology/Principle Findings To investigate the impact of stress and antidepressant treatment on CRE/CREB transcriptional activity, we generated a transgenic mouse line in which expression of the luciferase reporter gene is controlled by four copies of CRE. In this transgene, luciferase enzyme activity and protein were detected throughout the brain, e.g., in the hippocampal formation. Chronic social stress significantly increased (by 45 to 120%) CRE/CREB-driven gene expression measured as luciferase activity in several brain regions. This was also reflected by increased CREB-phosphorylation determined by immunoblotting. Treatment of the stressed mice with the antidepressant imipramine normalized luciferase expression to control levels in all brain regions and likewise reduced CREB-phosphorylation. In non-stressed animals, chronic (21 d) but not acute (24 h) treatment with imipramine (2×10 mg/kg/d) reduced luciferase expression in the hippocampus by 40–50%. Conclusions/Significance Our results emphasize a role of CREB in stress-regulated gene expression and support the view that the therapeutic actions of antidepressants are mediated via CRE/CREB-directed transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2011277467,"The nucleus contains diacylglycerol kinases (DGKs), i.e., the enzymes that, by converting diacylglycerol (DG) into phosphatidic acid, terminate DG-dependent events. It has been demonstrated that nuclear DGK-zeta interferes with cell cycle progression. We previously reported that nuclear DGK-zeta expression increased during myogenic differentiation, whereas its down-regulation impaired differentiation. Here, we evaluated the possible involvement of nuclear DGK-zeta in cell cycle progression of C2C12 myoblasts. Overexpression of a wild-type DGK-zeta, which mainly localized to the nucleus (but not of a kinase dead mutant or of a mutant that did not enter the nucleus), blocked the cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, as demonstrated by in situ analysis of biotinylated-16-dUTP incorporated into newly synthesized DNA and by flow cytometry. In contrast, down-regulation of endogenous DGK-zeta by short interfering RNA (siRNA) increased the number of cells in both the S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle. Cell cycle arrest of cells overexpressing wild-type DGK-zeta was accompanied by decreased levels of retinoblastoma protein phosphorylated on Ser-807/811. Down-regulation of endogenous DGK-zeta, using siRNA, prevented the cell cycle block characterizing C2C12 cell myogenic differentiation. Overall, our results identify nuclear DGK-zeta as a key determinant of cell cycle progression and differentiation of C2C12 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2022245796,"Somatic cytidine mutations in normal mammalian nuclear genes occur during antibody diversification in B lymphocytes and generate an isoform of apolipoprotein B in intestinal cells by RNA editing. Here, I describe that succinate dehydrogenase (SDH; mitochondrial complex II) subunit B gene (SDHB) is somatically mutated at a cytidine residue in normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and T-cell acute leukemia. Germ line mutations in the SDHB, SDHC or SDHD genes cause hereditary paraganglioma (PGL) tumors which show constitutive activation of homeostatic mechanisms induced by oxygen deprivation (hypoxia).To determine the prevalence of a mutation identified in the SDHB mRNA, 180 samples are tested. An SDHB stop-codon mutation c.136C>T (R46X) is present in a significant fraction (average = 5.8%, range = less than 1 to 30%, n = 52) of the mRNAs obtained from PBMCs. In contrast, the R46X mutation is present in the genomic DNA of PBMCs at very low levels. Examination of the PBMC cell-type subsets identifies monocytes and natural killer (NK) cells as primary sources of the mutant transcript, although lesser contributions also come from B and T lymphocytes. Transcript sequence analyses in leukemic cell lines derived from monocyte, NK, T and B cells indicate that the mutational mechanism targeting SDHB is operational in T-cell acute leukemia. Accordingly, substantial levels (more than 3%) of the mutant SDHB transcripts are detected in five of 20 primary childhood T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) bone marrow samples, but in none of 20 B-ALL samples. In addition, distinct heterozygous SDHB missense DNA mutations are identified in Jurkat and TALL-104 cell lines which are derived from T-ALLs.The identification of a recurrent, inactivating stop-codon mutation in the SDHB gene in normal blood cells suggests that SDHB is targeted by a cytidine deaminase enzyme. The SDHB mutations in normal PBMCs and leukemic T cells might play a role in cellular pre-adaptation to hypoxia."
https://openalex.org/W2011073340,"We developed a novel method for identifying SNPs widely distributed throughout the coding and non-coding regions of a genome. The method uses large-scale parallel pyrosequencing technology in combination with bioinformatics tools. We used this method to generate approximately 23,000 candidate SNPs throughout the Macaca mulatta genome. We estimate that over 60% of the SNPs will be of high frequency and useful for mapping QTLs, genetic management, and studies of individual relatedness, whereas other less frequent SNPs may be useful as population specific markers for ancestry identification. We have created a web resource called MamuSNP to view the SNPs and associated information online. This resource will also be useful for researchers using a wide variety of Macaca species in their research."
https://openalex.org/W2004444717,"Predation is generally thought to constrain sexual selection by female choice and limit the evolution of conspicuous sexual signals. Under high predation risk, females usually become less choosy, because they reduce their exposure to their predators by reducing the extent of their mate searching. However, predation need not weaken sexual selection if, under high predation risk, females exhibit stronger preferences for males that use conspicuous signals that help females avoid their predators. We tested this prediction in the fiddler crab Uca terpsichores by increasing females' perceived predation risk from crab-eating birds and measuring the attractiveness of a courtship signal that females use to find mates. The sexual signal is an arching mound of sand that males build at the openings of their burrows to which they attract females for mating. We found that the greater the risk, the more attractive were males with those structures. The benefits of mate preferences for sexual signals are usually thought to be linked to males' reproductive contributions to females or their young. Our study provides the first evidence that a female preference for a sexual signal can yield direct survival benefits by keeping females safe as they search for mates."
https://openalex.org/W2046599760,"The Src tyrosine kinase phosphorylates Cas (Crk-associated substrate) to confer anchorage independence and invasive growth potential to transformed cells. Gap junctional communication is often lower between aggressive tumor cells compared with normal or benign precursors. The gap junction protein connexin43 (Cx43) is a tumor suppressor that can inhibit tumor cell growth. Src can phosphorylate Cx43 to block gap junctional communication between transformed cells. However, mechanisms by which this event actually closes intercellular channels have not been clearly defined. Here, we report that Src and Cas associate with each other at intercellular junctions. In addition, Cas is required for Src to reduce dye transfer and electrical coupling between cells expressing Cx43. Thus, Src utilizes Cas to inhibit gap junctional communication mediated by Cx43. This finding introduces a novel role of the Cas focal adhesion linker protein in the gap junction complex.

These channels are composed of integral membrane proteins called connexins. Connexins have evolved into a family of at least 20 mammalian members, which are commonly named by their predicted molecular weights (19Harris A.L. Q. Rev.

In general, gap junctional communication is blocked in transformed cells (28Naus C.C. Goldberg G.S. Sin W.C. Winterhager E. Gap Junctions in Development and Disease.

For example, Cx43 expression is robust in normal glial and mammary cells but repressed in some glioma and mammary tumor cells. Moreover, restoration of Cx43 expression can normalize the growth of glioma and mammary carcinoma cells (27Hirschi K.K. Xu C.E. Tsukamoto T. Sager R.

Src phosphorylates connexin43 but may require downstream events to block gap junctional communication. Like Cas, Cx43 is a functionally relevant Src substrate. Src phosphorylates Cx43 on critical tyrosine residues, and this event can lead to reduced intercellular communication (32Lampe P.D. Lau A.F. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1171-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 33Swenson K.I. Piwnica-Worms H. McNamee H. Paul D.L.

However, in addition to tyrosine phosphorylation, other factors may be required for Src to block gap junctional communication mediated by Cx43. For example, MAPK acts downstream of Src to phosphorylate Cx43 on serine residues and close gap junction channels (35Zhou L. Kasperek E.M. Nicholson B.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1033-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Other kinases activated by Src, such as protein kinase C also disrupt junctions formed by Cx43 (36Jansen L.A. Mesnil M. Jongen W.M. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 1527-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In addition, other components may be involved since potential SH3 binding domains on Cx43 are required for channel closure in Src-transformed cells (35Zhou L. Kasperek E.M. Nicholson B.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1033-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Src and Cas both have SH3 domains (37O'Neill G.M. Fashena S.J. Golemis E.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 111-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). As described above, Src utilizes Cas to promote tumor cell metastasis (8Honda H. Oda H.

Genet. 1998; 19: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 10Goldberg G.S. Alexander D.B. Pellicena P. Zhang Z.Y. Tsuda H. Miller W.T. J. Biol.

Therefore, revealing functional relationships between Cas and Cx43 would aid in understanding how gap junctional communication may influence tumor cell growth. We hypothesized that Src utilizes Cas to block gap junctional communication mediated by Cx43. We report here that Cas associates with Cx43 at intercellular junctions and that Src requires Cas to suppress gap junctional communication mediated by Cx43. Cells and Analysis of Gene Expression—Homozygous Cas knock-out cells transfected with Cas (CasWt), v-Src (CasKoSrc), Cas and Src (CasWtSrc), or empty vector controls (CasKoHP) were maintained as described previously (10Goldberg G.S.

RNA extraction and microarray analysis of gene expression with 430A Mouse Expression Array gene chips (Affymetrix) was performed as described previously (38Shen Y. Jia Z. Nagele R.G. Ichikawa H. Goldberg G.S. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 1543-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Numerical results were normalized to a base value of 100. Duplicate independent experiments were done in all cases (n = 2). Small Interference RNA (siRNA) Transfection—siRNA targeted to p130-Cas containing equal parts of the sequences GGUAAUGCCUCGCUGCUUUUU, GGAGGACUAUGACUACGUUUU, GACCCGACAUCCAUUAAUCUU, and GAUUCUGGUUGGCAUGUAUUU (Dharmacon MQ09009600), or siCONTROL nontargeting siRNA (Dharmacon D00120613) were transfected into cells at a final concentration of 100 nm with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, catalog number 11668019) for 24 h as instructed by the manufacturers. After 24 h, this solution was replaced with standard medium and cells were examined by preloading and Western blot analysis after another 48 h of growth. Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis was done as described previously (38Shen Y. Jia Z. Nagele R.G. Ichikawa H. Goldberg G.S. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 1543-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) with some modification. Briefly, the cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 μg/ml proteinase inhibitor mixture (Sigma, P2714). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation. Bromphenol blue was added to 0.01% before protein (20 μg/lane) was resolved on 10% gels and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, IPVH-00010). Rabbit polyclonal antiserum was used to detect connexin43 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog number sc-9059) and active Src kinase (Cell Signaling Technology, 2101L). Mouse monoclonal antiserum was used to detect viral Src (Upstate Biotechnology, catalog number 05-185), phosphotyrosine (Cell Signaling Technology, catalog number 9411), Cas (Transduction Laboratories, catalog number 610271), and β-actin (Sigma, catalog number A1978). Primary antiserum was recognized by appropriate secondary antiserum conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and detected using enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting analysis systems (Amersham Biosciences, catalog number RPN 2108). After Western blotting, membranes were stained with India ink to verify equal loading and transfer. Immunofluorescence Confocal Microscopy—200,000 cells were plated on 35-mm poly-d-lysine-coated glass-bottomed culture dishes (MatTek, Inc.). After 24 h of growth, cells were fixed with cold 50% methanol, 50% acetone solution, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, and then washed thrice with 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS followed by 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min. The cells were incubated with connexin43 antibody at 4 °C overnight, washed, and then labeled with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes, catalog number A11008). Likewise, monoclonal antiserum specific for Cas (Transduction Laboratories, catalog number 610271) was labeled with anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluor 595 (Molecular Probes, catalog number A11005). Cell nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes, catalog number H1399). Images of CasKo cells or LA25 cells were obtained with a Carl Zeiss Axiovert 200 Pascal UGB confocal microscope or LSM510 meta confocal microscope equipped with a Plan-Apochromat 63× objective. HeNe1 (excitation: 543 nm), argon (excitation: 488 nm), and UV (excitation: 364 nm) lasers were used with appropriate band pass filters (BP:560–615, BP:505–530, BP:420–480) to detect Alexa 594, Alexa 488, and Hoechst 33342, respectively. Immunoprecipitation of Cx43 and Cas—Immunoprecipitation was performed as described (10Goldberg G.S. Alexander D.B. Pellicena P. Zhang Z.Y. Tsuda H. Miller W.T. J. Biol.

Briefly, confluent cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 μg/ml proteinase inhibitor mixture (Sigma, catalog number P2714). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation and incubated with Cx43 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog number sc-9059). Immune complexes were precipitated with resin linked to protein G (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog number sc-2002), washed with lysis buffer, and eluted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. For coimmunoprecipitation studies, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in CSK buffer (100 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm pipes pH 6.8) containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium vanadate (Sigma, catalog number S6508), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma, catalog number P7626), 50 mm NaF (Sigma, catalog number S7920), and 1% protease inhibitor mixture for mammalian cells (Sigma, catalog number P2417). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation and incubated with antiserum against Cx43 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog number SC9059) or Cas (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog number SC860). Immune complexes were precipitated with Protein G beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), washed with CSK buffer, and eluted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Evaluation of Gap Junction Communication—Intercellular dye transfer was evaluated by a preloading assay as described previously (39Goldberg G.S. Bechberger J.F. Naus C.C. BioTechniques. 1995; 18: 490-497PubMed Google Scholar, 42Goldberg G.S. Lampe P.D. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 154: 329-340PubMed Google Scholar). Basically, “Donor” cells were labeled with calcein and DiI before being plated with nonlabeled “Receiver” cells. Intercellular communication was visualized by the transfer of the small hydrophilic dye calcein (623 Da) to neighboring cells, while the lipophilic DiI does not transfer between cells. Cells were visualized on a Zeiss Axiovert 40 inverted microscope equipped with a Carl Zeiss AxioCam MRm CCD camera and Axiovision 4.3 analysis software. Gap junction communication was assayed as the number of unlabeled Receiver cells receiving Calcein (green) from a labeled Donor cell (green and red). Gap junctional conductance was obtained from cell pairs using a double whole cell voltage clamp configuration as described previously (23Goldberg G.S. Moreno A.P. Lampe P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36725-36730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, cells on glass coverslips were transfered into a glass-bottom recording chamber under a Nikon TE2000 upright microscope 4–18 h after plating. Access to the cytoplasm was achieved by using brief negative-pressure pulses after a gigaohm seal was formed between polished glass micropipettes (4–7 MΩ) and cell membranes. Micropipettes were filled with patch solution (in mmol/liter: 130 CsCl2, 2.0 CaCl2, 10 Hepes, 10 EGTA (pH 7.2)). During recording, cells were kept at room temperature in cesium-containing solution (in mmol/liter: 160 NaCl, 7 CsCl2, 2.0 CaCl2, 0.6 MgCl2, 10 Hepes (pH 7.4)) to increase nonjunctional membrane resistance. Gap junctional conductance (gj) for cell pairs was determined as a result of dividing by 10 mV the transjunctional current values (Ij) recorded, while the transmembrane voltage of both cells was kept at 0.0 mV, and a pulse of 10 mV-200-ms duration was alternatively applied to each cell at 1 Hz. Experimental stimulation, recording, series resistance compensation, and digitization were performed using a dual EPC-9 voltage clamp amplifier and Pulse and Pulsefit software (HEKA ELectronik, Lambrecht/Pfalz, Germany). Cx43 Is the Predominant Connexin Expressed by Src-transformed CasKo Cells—We utilized cells derived from homozygous null Cas knock-out mice (CasKo cells) to examine the effects of Cas and Src on Cx43-mediated gap junctional communication. These CasKo cells have been used to generate a well characterized system of cells that express neither Cas nor v-Src, Cas without v-Src, v-Src without Cas, or both v-Src and Cas. Previous work has demonstrated that Src utilizes Cas to promote anchorage-independent growth and migration of these cells (10Goldberg G.S. Alexander D.B. Pellicena P. Zhang Z.Y. Tsuda H. Miller W.T.

Probe sets were contained for Cx26, Cx29, Cx30, Cx30.3, Cx31, Cx31.1, Cx32, Cx36, Cx37, Cx40, Cx43, Cx45, Cx47, Cx50, and Cx57. As shown in Fig. 1, these data indicate that Cx43 was the most prominent connexin found at the mRNA level. Cas and Src Do Not Suppress Cx43 Expression—Cx43 protein expression was examined in CasKo cells transfected with Cas, v-Src, both Cas and Src, or empty vectors. As shown in Fig. 2a, Western blot analysis indicates that Cx43 was expressed in these cells regardless of Cas or Src expression. The next best candidate based on mRNA analysis shown in Fig. 1 was Cx45, and this protein was detected by Western blot analysis (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2a, Src transformation appeared to result in some increase in Cx43 production. This was also seen in LA25 cells, which express a temperature sensitive v-Src construct. As shown in Fig. 2b, slightly more Cx43 was seen in LA25 cells cultured at permissive temperate than cells grown at nonpermissive temperature. These data are consistent with previous observations comparing Cx43 expression in Src-transformed and nontransformed cells (41Goldberg G.S. Lau A.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 735-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2c, siRNA was used to effectively block Cas production in LA25 cells. Interestingly, data from Fig. 2 suggest that more Cx43 was seen in cells expressing Cas than cells without Cas. Moreover, this effect was independent of Src activity. Thus, Src and Cas did not decrease Cx43 production. Consistent with previous findings (10Goldberg G.S. Alexander D.B. Pellicena P. Zhang Z.Y. Tsuda H. Miller W.T. J. Biol.

Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 1543-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), data from Fig. 2 also indicate that equivalent levels of v-Src and active Src kinase were expressed in Src-transformed cells regardless of Cas expression. Cas and Cx43 Colocalize at Intercellular Junctions between Src-transformed Cells—Immunofluorescence microscopy was used to examine the effects of Src and Cas on Cx43 localization. As shown in Fig. 3, Cas and Cx43 were both detected at regions of cell to cell contact between Src-transformed cells. Thus, Src and Cas did not appear to suppress Cx43 protein expression or localization at intercellular junctions. Cx43 Associates with Cas—As shown in Fig. 3, Cas and Cx43 colocalize when visualized by confocal microscopy. We hypothesized that Src utilizes Cas to close gap junction channels formed by Cx43. This hypothesis predicts that Cas associates with Cx43 in Src-transformed cells. Immunoprecipitation experiments were performed to investigate whether or not Cas and Cx43 associate with each other. As shown in Fig. 4, Cas antiserum precipitated Cx43 in addition to Cas and, conversely, Cx43 antiserum precipitated Cas in addition to Cx43. These data indicate that Cas and Cx43 associate with each other (either directly or nondirectly) in Src-transformed cells. Src Utilizes Cas to Suppress Gap Junctional Communication—Gap junctional communication between CasKo cells transfected with Cas, Src, both Cas and Src, or empty vectors was visualized by intercellular dye transfer (22Goldberg G.S. Lampe P.D. Nicholson B.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 457-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 39Goldberg G.S. Bechberger J.F. Naus C.C. BioTechniques. 1995; 18: 490-497PubMed Google Scholar). Gap junctional communication was quantitated as the number of cells receiving dye from an individual preloaded cell (Fig. 5, a and b). As shown in Fig. 5c, nontransformed CasKo cells, or CasKo cells containing Src but not Cas, transferred dye to an average of about four neighbors, while CasKo cells expressing both Cas and Src transferred dye to an average of only one neighbor. As shown in Fig. 5d, LA25 cells grown at nonpermissive temperature transferred dye to over 30 neighbors. In contrast, these cells transferred dye to less than 10 cells at permissive temperature. However, transfection of LA25 cells with siRNA targeted to Cas increased dye transfer to over 30 neighbors at permissive temperature, while transfection with control siRNA has no effect (Fig. 5d). Thus, cells expressing both Cas and active v-Src displayed significantly less gap junctional communication than cells expressing either Cas or Src alone (p < 0.0001 by t test). These data suggest that Cas decreased gap junctional communication between Src-transformed cells by about ∼3–4-fold. In addition to dye transfer, effects of Src and Cas on gap junctional communication were evaluated by dual whole cell patch clamping. As shown in Fig. 6, CasKo cells transfected only with Cas exhibited a total conductance of about 15.8 nS. CasKo cells transfected only with Src displayed a similar total conductance of about 12.4 nS. In contrast, the total conductance of CasKo cells transfected with both Src and Cas was reduced to about 5.2 nS. Thus, as with dye transfer, cells expressing both Cas and Src displayed significantly less gap junctional communication than cells expressing either Cas or Src alone (p < 0.02 by t test). These data support the hypothesis that Src utilizes Cas to block gap junctional communication mediated by Cx43. Cas Is Not Required for Src to Induce Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Cx43—Phosphorylation of Cx43 on tyrosine has been implicated in suppression of gap junctional communication between Src-transformed cells (32Lampe P.D. Lau A.F. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1171-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). However, results also indicate that additional events are required to actually close channels formed by Cx43 (35Zhou L. Kasperek E.M. Nicholson B.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1033-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Taken together, data shown here indicate that Src activity was not sufficient to block gap junctional communication mediated by Cx43. This led us to examine whether or not Cas influenced the ability of Src to phosphorylate Cx43. As shown in Fig. 7, Cx43 was phosphorylated on tyrosine in Src-transformed cells regardless of Cas expression. These data suggest that phosphorylation of Cx43 on tyrosine was not sufficient to block gap junctional communication between Src-transformed cells; Cas was also required. It has been well established that the Src kinase can block gap junctional communication mediated by Cx43 (32Lampe P.D. Lau A.F. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1171-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 44Azarnia R. Loewenstein W.R. J. Membr. Biol. 1984; 82: 191-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Src phosphorylates Cx43 on two tyrosine residues, Tyr247 and Tyr265. Phosphorylation of these residues has been associated with inhibition of gap junctional communication between Src-transformed cells (33Swenson K.I. Piwnica-Worms H. McNamee H. Paul D.L. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 989-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 34Lin R. Warn-Cramer B.J. Kurata W.E. Lau A.F. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 815-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). However, other events, such as phosphorylation of Cx43 on serine residues is required for Src to block gap junctional communication mediated by Cx43 (35Zhou L. Kasperek E.M. Nicholson B.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1033-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). It should be noted that, in addition to tyrosine, a relatively large amount of serine phosphorylation is detected on Cx43 in Src-transformed cells (34Lin R. Warn-Cramer B.J. Kurata W.E. Lau A.F. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 815-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 41Goldberg G.S. Lau A.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 735-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Zhou et al. (35Zhou L. Kasperek E.M. Nicholson B.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1033-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) have reported that Src utilized MAPK to block gap junctional communication mediated by Cx43. However, we found that Cas did not augment MAPK activity in the Src-transformed CasKo cells or LA25 cells used for these studies (10Goldberg G.S. Alexander D.B. Pellicena P. Zhang Z.Y. Tsuda H. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46533-46540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). 3Y. Shen, P. R. Khusial, X. Li, H. Ichikawa, A. P. Moreno, and G. S. Goldberg, unpublished data. Taken together, reports thus far suggest that while phosphorylation of Cx43 on tyrosine is involved in blocking gap junctional communication, it is not sufficient. Events in addition to tyrosine phosphorylation are required for Src to close channels formed by Cx43 between cells (34Lin R. Warn-Cramer B.J. Kurata W.E. Lau A.F. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 815-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 35Zhou L. Kasperek E.M. Nicholson B.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1033-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). For example, Lin et al. (45Lin R. Martyn K.D. Guyette C.V. Lau A.F. Warn-Cramer B.J. Cell Commun. Adhes. 2006; 13: 199-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) have recently found that modification of tyrosine residues 247 and 265 to glutamate did not appear to affect channel function. Our data are consistent with this scenario. Without Cas, gap junctional communication persisted in Src-transformed cells, while Cx43 was phosphorylated on tyrosine. These data indicate that proteins are recruited by tyrosine phosphorylation to block gap junctional communication between tumor cells. Involvement of ancillary proteins suggest a more complex regulation of gap junctions than simple phosphorylation events closing connexin channels. Several Cx43 binding partners have been identified. For example, Src (46Loo L.W. Kanemitsu M.Y. Lau A.F. Mol. Carcinog. 1999; 25: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 47Kanemitsu M.Y. Loo L.W. Simon S. Lau A.F. Eckhart W. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 36943-36950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) all bind to the carboxyl tail of Cx43. In particular, the SH3 domain of Src can associate with Cx43 (47Kanemitsu M.Y. Loo L.W. Simon S. Lau A.F. Eckhart W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22824-22831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 51Duffy H.S. Ashton A.W. O'Donnell P. Coombs W. Taffet S.M. Delmar M. Spray D.C. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Thus, it may be suspected that the SH3 domain of Cas may also bind to Cx43. However, it should be noted that while the colocalization and immunoprecipitation studies presented here indicate that Cas and Cx43 associate with each other, this association may not be direct. Instead, associations between Cas and Cx43 may be mediated by a mutual partner. Our data suggest that Cas does not appear to act as an adaptor protein required for Src to phosphorylate Cx43. Cx43 was still phosphorylated in Cas-deficient cells. However, such a scenario should not be ruled out at this point. For example, a Cas homolog, such as Hef1 (11Bouton A.H. Riggins R.B. Bruce-Staskal P.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6448-6458Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), may have mediated such an interaction in the absence of Cas. A functional role of Cas in blocking gap junctional communication between tumor cells presents some clear biological significance. Cas is required for Src to promote metastatic cell growth, and Cx43 is a tumor suppressor. Src utilizes Cas to confer tumor cells with the most fundamentally important properties of metastatic growth including anchorage independence and increased motility (8Honda H. Oda H. Nakamoto T.

Siesser P.F. Shin N.Y. Pozzi A. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cancer Res. 2005; 3: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Cx43 is a tumor suppressor gene that can inhibit tumor cell growth (27Hirschi K.K. Xu C.E. Tsukamoto T. Sager R. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 861-870PubMed Google Scholar, 28Naus C.C. Goldberg G.S.

Thus, it stands to reason that mechanisms promoting tumor cell growth should effectively silence Cx43 activity. Indeed, as outlined in Fig. 8, our data indicate that Src utilizes Cas to block gap junctional communication in addition to promoting hallmarks of tumor cell growth. Cas links integrins to other components in the focal adhesion complex (37O'Neill G.M. Fashena S.J. Golemis E.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 111-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The present studies introduce a novel role of Cas in the gap junction complex. A double role for junctional adaptor proteins is not unprecedented. For example, β-catenin acts a structural adaptor protein linking cadherins to the cytoskeleton and as a nuclear transcription factor involved in the Wnt signaling pathway (53Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 207-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 54Lilien J. Balsamo J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). It should be interesting to elucidate mechanisms by which Cas acts as a Src effector for both focal adhesions and gap junctions."

We show that p35 binds directly to α/β-tubulin and microtubules. Microtubule polymers but not the α/β-tubulin heterodimer block p35 interaction with Cdk5 and therefore inhibit Cdk5-p35 activity. p25, a neurotoxin-induced and truncated form of p35, does not have tubulin and microtubule binding activities, and Cdk5-p25 is inert to the inhibitory effect of microtubules. p35 displays strong activity in promoting microtubule assembly and inducing formation of microtubule bundles. Furthermore, microtubules stabilized by p35 are resistant to cold-induced disassembly. In cultured cortical neurons, a significant proportion of p35 localizes to microtubules. When microtubules were isolated from rat brain extracts, p35 co-assembled with microtubules, including cold-stable microtubules. Together, these findings suggest that p35 is a microtubule-associated protein that modulates microtubule dynamics. Also, microtubules play an important role in the control of Cdk5 activation.

Together, these findings suggest that p35 is a microtubule-associated protein that modulates microtubule dynamics. Also, microtubules play an important role in the control of Cdk5 activation. As a distinct member of the CDK family, Cdk5 is activated by a neuron-specific protein p35 or the p39 homologue of p35 in the central nervous system (1Dhavan R. Tsai L.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). Both Cdk5 and p35 are required for neurite outgrowth (2Nikolic M. Dudek H. Kwon Y.T. Ramos Y.F. Tsai L.H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 816-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Studies in animal models have revealed their crucial involvements in neuronal migration during nervous system development as mice deficient of Cdk5 or p35 display abnormal brain cortex (3Chae T. Kwon Y.T. Bronson R. Dikkes P. Li E. Tsai L.H. Neuron. 1997; 18: 29-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 4Ohshima T. Ward J.M. Huh C.G. Longenecker G.

To date, a wide range of evidence has been accumulated indicating that Cdk5-p35 is a multifunctional kinase that acts in the regulation of various neuronal activities, including organization of the microtubule cytoskeleton (1Dhavan R. Tsai L.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). In living cells, the dynamic properties of microtubules are modulated through a sophisticated mechanism involving microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), 2The abbreviations used are: MAP, microtubule-associated protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DTT, dithiothreitol; K-PIPES, potassium 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. 2The abbreviations used are: MAP, microtubule-associated protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DTT, dithiothreitol; K-PIPES, potassium 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. which bind microtubule polymers and promote microtubule polymerization by stabilizing the polymer structure (5Mandelkow E. Mandelkow E.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 72-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Cdk5 phosphorylates several MAPs including MAP1b, MAP2, tau, and doublecortin, mediating their association with microtubules and their microtubule-stabilizing functions (1Dhavan R. Tsai L.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar, 6Lim A.C. Qu D. Qi R.Z. Neurosignals. 2003; 12: 230-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 7Tanaka T.

Although p35 shows little apparent sequence homology to cyclins, it resembles the cyclin A structure with distinct features to bind specifically to Cdk5 (8Tang D. Chun A.C. Zhang M. Wang J.H. J.

Several proteins, including C42, protein kinase CK2, and three importin family members (importin-β, importin-5, and importin-7), show inhibitory effects toward Cdk5 activation via binding to p35 (11Lim A.C.

Under neurotoxic conditions, p35 is transformed into the N-terminally truncated p25 protein, which causes sustained activation and mislocalization of Cdk5 (14Kusakawa G. Saito T. Onuki R. Ishiguro K.

Moreover, p25 deregulation of Cdk5 has been linked to neuronal cell death and pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease (1Dhavan R. Tsai L.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). In this report, we have identified direct association of p35 with tubulin and microtubules and have shown the function of p35 as a MAP as well as the regulation of Cdk5 activation by microtubules.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies—The following antibodies were purchased: anti-α-tubulin from Abcam; anti-β-tubulin (TUB2.1) from Sigma; anti-tau (H-150), anti-p35 (C-19), and anti-Cdk5 (C-8 and J-3) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; and anti-GST from GE Healthcare.Recombinant Protein Production—Recombinant proteins of Cdk5, p35, and p35 fragments were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and were purified (11Lim A.C.

Zhu X. Goedert M. Fujita D.J. Wang J.H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Recombinant proteins used in microtubule sedimentation and polymerization assays were dialyzed in PEM buffer (80 mm K-PIPES, pH 6.9, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EGTA) supplemented with 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 50 mm NaCl.Microtubule Isolation from Rat Brain—Brain microtubules were isolated by temperature-dependent assembly/disassembly experiments (19Vallee R.B. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 89-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Rat brain was homogenized on ice in 2-folds (v/w) of homogenization buffer (PEM buffer plus 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, and the protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). The homogenate was cleared by centrifugation at 4 °C first at 20,000 × g for 45 min and then at 100,000 × g for 45 min. Microtubule assembly was initiated in the extract by the addition of 30% (v/v) glycerol and 1 mm GTP and was conducted at 35 °C for 45 min. After microtubules were spun down at 35 °C (100,000 × g; 45 min), the supernatant was removed. The pelleted microtubules were resuspended by homogenization in the ice-cold homogenization buffer and were allowed to disassemble on ice for 45 min. The suspension was then centrifuged at 4 °C (100,000 × g;45 min) to pellet undisrupted microtubules, which were designated as cold-stable microtubules. The resulting supernatant, which was derived from cold-labile microtubules, was used for the following cycles of microtubule assembly/disassembly.Isolation of MAP-free Tubulin—Tubulin was purified from porcine brain by two cycles of microtubule assembly/disassembly followed by phosphocellulose chromatography (19Vallee R.B. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 89-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The temperature-dependent assembly and disassembly were performed as described above except that PEM buffer was used instead of the homogenization buffer, and 1 mm each of ATP and GTP was applied for microtubule polymerization in the first cycle. After two assembly/disassembly cycles, the pre-cleared tubulin sample was applied at less than 3 mg protein/ml resin to a phosphocellulose (Whatman) column, which was pre-equilibrated with the buffer of 50 mm K-PIPES, pH 6.9, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.2 mm MgCl2. After column washing by the buffer, peak tubulin fractions were pooled, aliquoted into a small volume, and quickly frozen by liquid nitrogen for storage at –80 °C. Coomassie Blue staining of the purified tubulin proteins separated by SDS-PAGE did not detect any contaminating protein, and anti-tau Western blotting did not detect tau in the samples.Microtubule Sedimentation—Microtubule cosedimentation was performed as described previously (20Lim A.C. Tiu S.Y. Li Q. Qi R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4433-4439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Proteins were centrifuged at 4 °C (100,000 × g; 30 min) to remove aggregates before experiments.Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Five-day cultures of mouse cortical neurons were immunostained as described previously (13Fu X.

Chem. 2006; 281: 39014-39021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and were analyzed on a Nikon microscope (Eclipse TE2000).Extraction of Microtubule Proteins from Cell Cultures—Microtubule proteins and the remaining cytoplasm were differentially extracted from 5-day cultures of cortical neurons as described previously (17Qu D. Li Q. Lim H.Y. Cheung N.S. Li R. Wang J.H. Qi R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7324-7332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Both extracted fractions were clarified by centrifugation before subjected to Western blotting.Cdk5 Binding Assay and Immunoprecipitation—GST-Cdk5 (2 μg), prereconstituted with p35-His6 or p25-His6 (2 μg), was incubated with α/β-tubulin or taxol-stabilized microtubules at 25°C for 1 h in 800 μl of PEM buffer supplemented with 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors. GST-Cdk5 was retrieved using GSH beads to detect bound p35/p25 by Western blotting. To perform Cdk5 immunoprecipitation, rat brain extract prepared in the homogenization buffer was added with 2 mm GTP and 10 μm taxol or nocodazole and was then incubated at 35 °C for 1 h. Following the incubation, anti-Cdk5 (J-3) immunoprecipitation was carried out to analyze co-precipitation of p35.Cdk5 Kinase Assay—Cdk5 kinase activity was determined by phosphorylation of a histone H1 peptide PKTPKKAKKL as detailed in a previous report (10Qi Z.

The light scattering assay was performed with 2 mg/ml α/β-tubulin at 35 °C in PEM buffer supplemented with 1 mm GTP and 10 mm MgCl2 (20Lim A.C. Tiu S.Y. Li Q. Qi R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4433-4439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 21Gaskin F. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To examine polymerized microtubules by electron microscopy, samples were deposited onto electron microscopic grids (carbon-coated copper grids) and were negatively stained in 2% uranyl acetate (21Gaskin F. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The specimens were examined on a Philipps CM-20 electron microscope.Quantitative Western Blotting—Images of anti-Cdk5 (C-8) and anti-p35/p25 (C-19) Western blots were acquired on the ChemiDoc XRS system (Bio-Rad) and were analyzed using the Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Known amounts of recombinant Cdk5 and p25 proteins were used as standards on all blots. The quantities of Cdk5 and p35/p25 in the samples were calculated from within the linear range of standard curves from each Western blot done in triplicate.RESULTSp35 Binds to Tubulin and Microtubules—In brain, Cdk5 and p35 appear in various molecular complexes (1Dhavan R. Tsai L.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar, 6Lim A.C. Qu D. Qi R.Z. Neurosignals. 2003; 12: 230-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We sought for p35-interacting proteins by biochemical affinity isolation from rat brain using immobilized p35 fragments (11Lim A.C. Hou Z. Goh C.P. Qi R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46668-46673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 17Qu D. Li Q. Lim H.Y. Cheung N.S. Li R. Wang J.H. Qi R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7324-7332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). After separation of the isolated proteins by electrophoresis, the most prominent band that appeared specifically in the pull-down of p10, but not in that of p25, was revealed by mass spectrometry to be α- and β-tubulins. We then examined pull-downs from brain extract by Western blotting. Both p10 and p35 were bound to α- and β-tubulins in the extract, whereas p25 did not exhibit any detectable tubulin-binding activity (Fig. 1A). The identical results were obtained when the binding was tested using purified MAP-free α/β-tubulin (Fig. 1B). Thus, the N-terminal region of p35 interacts directly with the α/β-tubulin heterodimer.To examine microtubule association, p35 and its fragments were incubated with microtubules polymerized from MAP-free tubulin and stabilized with taxol. After centrifugation to sediment microtubules, almost all p35 and p10 were found in the microtubule fraction, whereas p25 and GST were exclusively detected in the supernatant (Fig. 1C). In the control assays in which tubulin was omitted, all of the recombinant proteins were not pelleted by the centrifugation (Fig. 1C). We conclude that the N-terminal region of p35 can bind directly to microtubules. p35 Localizes to Microtubules in Brain—When p35 was examined in cultured cortical neurons, immunofluorescence revealed the co-localization of p35 and the microtubule structure in neurites including the growth cones (Fig. 1D). These data were in agreement with the observations in a previous report (2Nikolic M. Dudek H. Kwon Y.T. Ramos Y.F. Tsai L.H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 816-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). To assess p35 distribution, cultured neurons were fractionated to sequentially extract cytoplasmic and microtubule proteins. Approximately one-third of p35 associated with microtubule polymers (Fig. 1E). Under the extraction conditions, p25 was undetectable in the extracts (data not shown). Cdk5 was only detected in the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig. 1E), implying that microtubule-associated p35 is free of Cdk5 binding.To further analyze the microtubule association, we isolated microtubules from adult rat brain through three cycles of temperature-induced assembly and disassembly. When microtubules were assembled in the brain extract during the first cycle, the majority of p35 associated with the polymers, including the cold-stable polymers (Fig. 1F). Most of Cdk5 remained in the supernatant, where Cdk5 was in abundance when compared with p35 and p25 (Fig. 1, F and G). p25 was detected in the cold-labile but not cold-stable fraction of microtubules (Fig. 1F). In the following cycles, p35 continued to assemble with both cold-labile and cold-stable microtubules; Cdk5 and p25 existed with cold-labile microtubules (Fig. 1F). When probed as a control, tau was found to be present almost exclusively with cold-labile microtubules of each cycle (Fig. 1F). After three cycles of assembly/disassembly, microtubules were essentially free of contaminants. In the isolated cold-labile microtubules, the amount of p35 and p25 combined was more than Cdk5 (Fig. 1G). In the cold-stable microtubules, p25 was undetectable, and p35 was greatly in excess of Cdk5 (p35:Cdk5 was 6:1; Fig. 1, F and G). Thus, p35 associated with the microtubules was free of Cdk5 binding. Taken together, the microtubule co-assembly demonstrates prominent association of p35 with microtubules including cold-stable microtubules. In a previous report, the Cdk5-p25 kinase is shown to associate indirectly with microtubules via binding to tau (22Sobue K. garwal-Mawal A. Li W. Sun W. Miura Y. Paudel H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16673-16680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We reason that the sedimentation of Cdk5 and p25 with cold-labile microtubules was attributed to their association with tau and possibly some other MAPs in the brain extract.Microtubules Disrupt the Association of p35 with Cdk5—We investigated how Cdk5, p35, and microtubules interact with one another. Cdk5 does not bind directly to microtubules (22Sobue K. garwal-Mawal A. Li W. Sun W. Miura Y. Paudel H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16673-16680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In a binding assay, the preformed complex of Cdk5 and p35 was incubated with taxol-stabilized microtubules or with the α/β-tubulin heterodimer. Interestingly, the microtubules disrupted the interaction between p35 and Cdk5 in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the tubulin dimer did not exhibit any effect (Fig. 2A). In addition, the microtubules did not affect p25 binding to Cdk5 (Fig. 2A). In accordance with these findings, the microtubule polymers but not the tubulin dimer inhibited the activity of Cdk5-p35, and the polymers did not inhibit the activity of Cdk5-p25 (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2Microtubules disrupt the interaction between Cdk5 and p35. A and B, the complex of GST-Cdk5 and p35-His6 or p25-His6 was incubated with tubulin or taxol-stabilized microtubules (MTs). After retrieval of GST-Cdk5, the beads were analyzed by anti-p35 Western blotting and in the Cdk5 kinase assay. The Western blot (A) shown is a representative from three independent experiments, and the kinase assay data of the experiments were plotted (B). C, co-immunoprecipitation of p35 with Cdk5 is blocked by taxol-induced microtubule formation. The rat brain extract was treated with taxol (Tax) to allow for microtubule assembly or with nocodazole (Noc) to inhibit microtubule assembly. After Cdk5 immunoprecipitation, the immunoprecipitates (IPs) were analyzed for Cdk5 and p35.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Next, we conducted co-immunoprecipitation of Cdk5 and p35 from a rat brain extract that was pretreated with taxol to induce microtubule assembly or with nocodazole to inhibit the assembly. In the presence of taxol, p35 failed to co-precipitate with Cdk5 (Fig. 2C). In contrast, the co-immunoprecipitation was readily detected under the inhibitory condition of microtubule assembly (Fig. 2C). Therefore, microtubules sequester p35 but not p25 from Cdk5 and thus inhibit p35 activation of Cdk5.p35 Induces Microtubule Assembly and Bundling—The microtubule and tubulin association prompted us to investigate whether p35 alters microtubule assembly characteristics. In the absence of p35, there was a minimal polymerization of tubulin even after a prolonged incubation because tubulin was below the concentration required for spontaneous polymerization (Fig. 3A). The addition of 3 μg/ml p35 (p35:tubulin at ∼1:400) resulted in significant polymerization of tubulin (Fig. 3A). Both the rate and the extent of polymerization were significantly enhanced in a manner dependent on the input of p35. With 12 μg/ml p35 (p35:tubulin at 1:100), most of the tubulin was polymerized into microtubule polymers. Thus, p35 exhibited a strong activity in inducing microtubule assembly. We also tested the p35 fragments p10 and p25 in the assay. In contrast to p35, neither p10 nor p25 induced microtubule assembly when applied at the same amount as p35 or even at much higher concentrations (data not shown). Given that p10 retains the microtubule and tubulin binding activities (Fig. 1), the microtubule-polymerizing function either involves additional domains from the p25 region or requires it for protein folding. Conceivably, the neurotoxin-induced cleavage of p35 abrogates its microtubule-polymerizing property.FIGURE 3p35 induces microtubule assembly and bundling. A, microtubule assembly was performed with various amounts of p35-His6 in the light scattering assay. The plot is a representative of three independent assays. B, electron micrographs of microtubules assembled from tubulin only (panel a), tubulin plus taxol (panel b), and tubulin plus 6 μg/ml p35-His6 (panels c and d). The same magnification applies to panel a–c (scale bars,1 μm), and a higher magnification applies to panel d (scale bar, 0.5 μm). C, microtubules stabilized by p35 are cold-stable. Microtubules assembled by p35 (6 μg/ml) or tau (160 μg/ml) were incubated on ice. The absorbance was expressed as percentages of the values measured when the ice incubation started. The plot represents data (±S.D.) from three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To observe polymerized microtubules, samples from the assembly assay were negatively stained for electron microscopy. In agreement with the turbidimetric assay results, almost no microtubules were found in the assay sample without p35 (Fig. 3B, panel a). Microtubules were readily seen in those polymerized by using taxol or p35 (Fig. 3B, panels b and c). Interestingly, most of the p35-assembled microtubules existed in the form of bundles (Fig. 3B, panel c). As seen in the micrograph, several microtubules were closely attached to each other to form a bundle (Fig. 3B, panel d). In the control, taxol-polymerized microtubules did not form bundles (Fig. 3B, panel b), consistent with the observation in a previous report (23Turner P.F. Margolis R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 940-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It appeared that p35 cross-bridges microtubules in addition to the promotion of microtubule assembly.Given the co-isolation of p35 and cold-stable microtubules from rat brain, we tested whether p35 can stabilize microtubules at low temperature. In the assay, microtubules polymerized in vitro were placed on ice, and solution turbidity was monitored. Most of tau-stabilized microtubules depolymerized within a few minutes (Fig. 3C) as tau does not confer the cold stability (20Lim A.C. Tiu S.Y. Li Q. Qi R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4433-4439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 24Baas P.W. Pienkowski T.P. Cimbalnik K.A. Toyama K. Bakalis S. Ahmad F.J. Kosik K.S. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 135-143PubMed Google Scholar). The turbidity of the p35-polymerized sample barely changed even after 30 min of incubation (Fig. 3C). Thus, microtubules stabilized by p35 are resistant to cold-induced disassembly.DISCUSSIONThis report describes for the first time the role of p35 as a MAP and the inactivation of Cdk5-p35 by microtubules. The p10 region of p35, which contains microtubule- and tubulin-binding domains, is rich in basic residues, reminiscent of the microtubule-binding sequences of conventional MAPs. However, scanning of the p10 sequence did not yield any recognizable microtubule-binding motif, implicating that p35 may contain novel microtubule- and tubulin-binding domains. The binding of p35 to microtubules does not confer Cdk5 attachment to microtubules. Instead, microtubules segregate p35 from Cdk5, acting as an inhibitor of Cdk5. Given that a significant proportion of p35 localizes to microtubules, the microtubule cytoskeleton may play an important role in the control of Cdk5 activity. Similar to microtubules, importin-β, importin-5, and importin-7 have been shown to block p35 association with Cdk5 via binding to the N-terminal region of p35 (13Fu X. Choi Y.K. Qu D. Yu Y. Cheung N.S. Qi R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39014-39021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Therefore, this p35 region confers Cdk5 inhibition via interaction with certain protein factors or subcellular structures, which sequester p35 from Cdk5. The truncation of p35 to p25, which loses the N-terminal domain, is a way to relieve the inhibition. Indeed, the production of p25 causes aberrant activation of Cdk5 (16Patrick G.N. Zukerberg L. Nikolic M. de la M.S. Dikkes P. Tsai L.H. Nature. 1999; 402: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1307) Google Scholar).p35 has strong microtubule-polymerizing activity. The current model of microtubule polymerization involves the formation of microtubule nuclei (i.e. nucleation) from several tubulin dimers (25Desai A. Mitchison T.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 83-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (1923) Google Scholar). Our preliminary results showed the intermolecular self-association of p35. 3L. He and R. Z. Qi, unpublished data. Therefore, p35 may facilitate microtubule nucleation through its homodimerization/oligomerization, and subsequently, stabilize the microtubules in the form of bundles. In addition, our results suggest that p35 may be one of the microtubule cold stabilizers and that the stabilization is at least partially due to the effect of bundling. In many cell types, there is a family of MAPs called stable tubule-only polypeptides, which render microtubules cold-stable (26Bosc C. Andrieux A. Job D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12125-12132Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Although studies using transgenic mice have revealed a role of stable tubule-only polypeptides in synaptic plasticity, the precise function of microtubule cold stability is still unclear (27Andrieux A. Salin P.A. Vernet M. Kujala P. Baratier J. Gory-Faure S. Bosc C. Pointu H. Proietto D. Schweitzer A. Denarier E. Klumperman J. Job D. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2350-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The function of p35 as a MAP is highly relevant to its role in neuronal migration or morphogenesis. The localization of p35 to microtubules is readily found in axons and dendrites including the growth cone at the leading edge of an extending neurite. As the leading edge extends, microtubules undergo active polymerization to grow into the protrusion. Also, microtubules play a critical role in the movement of the nucleus into the leading process of migrating cells. The results presented here suggest that p35 directly participates in microtubule assembly and stabilization during these processes. It has been shown that the Cdk5-p35 kinase modulates the microtubule architecture through its action toward several molecular targets such as doublecortin and focal adhesion kinase (7Tanaka T. Serneo F.F. Tseng H.C. Kulkarni A.B. Tsai L.H. Gleeson J.G. Neuron. 2004; 41: 215-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 28Xie Z. Sanada K. Samuels B.A. Shih H. Tsai L.H. Cell. 2003; 114: 469-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Therefore, p35 may play a multifunctional role in the regulation of microtubule dynamics. As a distinct member of the CDK family, Cdk5 is activated by a neuron-specific protein p35 or the p39 homologue of p35 in the central nervous system (1Dhavan R. Tsai L.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). Both Cdk5 and p35 are required for neurite outgrowth (2Nikolic M. Dudek H. Kwon Y.T. Ramos Y.F. Tsai L.H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 816-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Studies in animal models have revealed their crucial involvements in neuronal migration during nervous system development as mice deficient of Cdk5 or p35 display a"

To test this possibility, we examined whether Aβ alters the expression of cell fate determinants in cerebral cortical cultures and in an Alzheimer disease mouse model (PrP-APPSW). Up-regulation of Mash1 and down-regulation of Olig2 were found in cerebral cortical cultures treated with Aβ-(1-42). Mash1 was expressed in nestin-positive immature cells. The majority of Mash1-positive cells in untreated cortical culture co-expressed Olig2. Aβ increased the proportion of Olig2-negative/Mash1-positive cells. A decrease in Olig2+ cells was also observed in the cerebral cortex of adult PrP-APPSW mice. Cotransfection experiments with Mash1 cDNA and Olig2 siRNA revealed that overexpression of Mash1 in neurosphere cells retaining Olig2 expression enhanced neural differentiation but accelerated death of Olig2-depleted cells. Growth factor deprivation, which down-regulated Olig2, accelerated death of Mash1-overexpressing neurosphere cells. We conclude that cooperation between Mash1 and Olig2 is necessary for neural stem/progenitor cells to develop into fully mature neurons and that down-regulation of Olig2 by Aβ in Mash1-overexpressing cells switches the cell fate to death.

Maintaining Olig2 expression in differentiating cells could have therapeutic potential. Adult neural stem/progenitor cells continue to generate neurons in the brain throughout life, and therefore, there are high expectations that it may be possible to repair the nervous system in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease by stimulating endogenous progenitor cells or by stem cell transplantation. Neural stem/progenitor cells have successfully generated new neurons in vitro (1Nunes M.C. Roy N.S. Keyoung H.M. Goodman R.R. McKhann Jr., G. Jiang L. Kang J. Nedergaard M. S.A. G. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 439-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar); however, neurogenesis in vivo appears to be limited to the subventricular zone and the subgranular zone of the adult intact brain (2Ming G.L. Song H. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 28: 223-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar). The environment of other regions of the adult brain, including the neocortex, may be restrictive for the differentiation of progenitors or the survival of newly formed neurons. If the environmental restriction could be reduced, new neurons could be generated from progenitors and could survive in the adult brain. In fact, brain injuries induce proliferation of progenitors in the subventricular zone and the subgranular zone and sometimes cause migration of newly generated neurons to injured sites of the adult brain (2Ming G.L. Song H. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 28: 223-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar). A specific type of injury also appears to induce in situ neurogenesis in the adult neocortex that does not normally undergo neurogenesis (3Magavi S.S. Leavitt B.R. Macklis J.D. Nature. 2000; 405: 951-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar). In Alzheimer disease (AD), 2The abbreviations used are: AD, Alzheimer disease; Aβ, β-amyloid; APP, amyloid precursor protein; DIV, days in vitro; EGF, epidermal growth factor; FGF2, fibroblast growth factor 2; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein; QRT-PCR, quantitative real-time PCR; RT, reverse transcription; Tg, transgenic; siRNA, small interfering RNA. immature neuronal marker proteins are increased in the subgranular zone and the CA1 region of the hippocampus (4Jin K. Peel A.L. Mao X.O. Xie L. Cottrell B.A. Henshall D.C. Greenberg D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 343-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). However, the increased neurogenesis in the AD brain is not sufficient to repair the nervous system because progressive neuronal loss occurs in CA1 of AD patients. Alterations of the microenvironment in the AD hippocampus may affect the fate of immature neurons. Because β-amyloid (Aβ), of which deposits are one of the hallmarks of AD, plays an important role in the early pathogenesis of AD (5Hardy J. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 154-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to speculate that Aβ alters the brain microenvironment to make it toxic to newborn neurons. AD mouse models and stem cell culture may be useful tools for examining this possibility. However, contradictory findings have been reported regarding whether hippocampal neurogenesis in AD mouse models is impaired or enhanced; most AD mouse models (PrP-APPSW Tg, PDGF-APPV717F Tg, PS1P117L Tg, PS1M146V knockin) show impaired hippocampal neurogenesis (6Becker M.

Elder G.A. Neurobiol. Dis. 2002; 10: 8-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), but in one AD mouse model (PDGF-APPSW, In Tg), increased neurogenesis was reported (12Jin K. Galvan V. Xie L.

The in vitro effects of Aβ peptide on the proliferation and differentiation of neural stem/progenitor cells are also controversial (9Haughey N.J. Nath A. Chan S.L. Borchard A.C. Rao M.S. Mattson M.P. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 1509-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 13Calafiore M. Battaglia G. Zappala A. Trovato-Salinaro E. Caraci F. Caruso M. Vancheri C. Sortino M.A. Nicoletti F.

Aging. 2006; 27: 1181-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus, the question of whether the brain microenvironment is altered by Aβ, rendering it toxic to progenitor cells and immature neurons, still remains unanswered. Neocortical neurogenesis has not been reported at all in AD patients. However, in an AD mouse model (PDGF-APPV717F) that has impaired hippocampal neurogenesis, bromodeoxyuridine (BrUrd)-incorporating mature neurons (BrUrd+/NeuN+ cells) have been found in non-neurogenic regions throughout the adult central nervous system, including the cerebral cortex (6Becker M. Lavie V. Solomon B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 1691-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Therefore, the possibility of neocortical neurogenesis in AD cannot be ruled out. The molecular mechanisms underlying disease-induced cell proliferation and differentiation of progenitors in the neocortex are largely unknown. To address these issues, we examined the expression of basic helix-loop-helix factors, which are involved in neurogenesis during development, in Aβ-treated cultures, and in the cerebral cortex of an AD mouse model (PrP-APPSW, Tg2576). We also examined whether the altered expression of these genes leads to the stimulation of neuronal differentiation or death. The results presented here demonstrate the up-regulation of Mash1 and down-regulation of Olig2 in cerebral cortical cultures treated with Aβ. Mash1 and Olig2 are basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors involved in initiating neurogenesis and oligodendrogenesis in the central nervous system (16Ross S.E. Greenberg M.E. Stiles C.D. Neuron. 2003; 39: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). We found that Aβ increased in the number of Olig2-negative/mash1+ cells, which do not show lineage-specific markers and, thus, are possibly immature cells, e.g. neural stem/progenitor cells. In the AD mouse model, a decrease in Olig2+ cells occurred in cerebral cortex. Cotransfection experiments with Mash1 cDNA and Olig2 siRNA revealed that the overexpression of Mash1 in neurosphere cells retaining Olig2 expression induced neural differentiation rather than cell death, but Mash1 overexpression in cells in which Olig2 was depleted by specific siRNA induced cell death. These results indicate that cooperation between Mash1 and Olig2 may be necessary for neural stem/progenitor cells to develop into fully mature neurons and that down-regulation of Olig2 in Mash1-overexpressing cells by Aβ may switch the cell fate to death. Cell Culture—For neuronal cell culture, cerebral cortices dissected from day E17 embryonic rats were dissociated by incubation with 0.08% trypsin, 0.008% DNase I at 37 °C for 10 min and passed through a 62-μm nylon mesh. The cells (105 cells/dish for immunocytochemistry or 4.5 × 106 cells/dish for the preparation of RNA or protein) were seeded in gelatin-polyornithine-coated dishes of 3.5- or 6-cm diameter, respectively, and were cultured for 3 or 6 days in minimum essential medium, 5% fetal bovine serum, 10 μm β-mercaptoethanol. For neural stem/progenitor cell culture, telencephalon dissected from E14 embryonic rats was dissociated using methods similar to those described above. Culture dishes were coated with poly-2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate (1.6 mg/cm2; Sigma) to prevent cell attachment (17Yamamoto S. Nagao M. Sugimori M. Kosako H. Nakatomi H. Yamamoto N. Takebayashi H. Nabeshima Y. Kitamura T. Weinmaster G. Nakamura K. Nakafuku M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9814-9823Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were maintained in suspension at a density of 3 × 105 cells/ml in growth medium (1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and F-12 medium) containing the B-27 supplement, 2 μg/ml heparin, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20 ng/ml human recombinant fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), and mouse epidermal growth factor (EGF). The medium was replaced twice a week. At 7 days in vitro, cell aggregates (neurospheres) were collected and dissociated with 0.08% trypsin, 0.008% DNase I. Dissociated cells were seeded onto gelatin-polyornithine-coated dishes at a density of 104 cells/cm2 and fed for 16 h in the above medium for further transfection experiments. Treatment with Aβ Peptides—Aβ-(1-42) and synthetic peptides with the reverse sequence of Aβ-(1-42) or Aβ-(1-40) (Bachem Inc.) were dissolved at 250 μm in 0.05 n HCl, filtered through a 0.45-μm membrane filter, diluted with minimum essential medium with N2 supplement, and neutralized. The peptide solution (5 μm) was added to the 3 or 6 DIV cultures immediately after preparation. Mice—Three pairs of 15-21-month-old heterozygous Tg2576 (PrP-APPSW) mice and wild-type littermates were purchased from Taconic Farm, Inc. Mice were killed by anesthesia overdose and perfused transcardially with saline followed by ice-cold phosphate-buffered 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were post-fixed in phosphate-buffered 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h at 4 °C. After the cryoprotection with 20% sucrose, brains were sectioned coronally at 10 μm through the entire hippocampus on a freezing microtome. cDNA Macroarray—Total RNA from cultured cortical neurons was isolated using the total RNA purification kit (Amersham Biosciences). After the treatment of total RNA with DNase 1, reverse transcription was carried out using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase XL and specific oligo primers in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP according to the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech, PT3140-1). 32P-Labeled cDNA probes were hybridized to separate Atlas Rat 1.2 Array (Clontech) membranes according to the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech, PT3140-1). Radioactivity on the array membrane was measured with a Bioimage analyzer BAS 2500 (Fuji Film) and analyzed with ArrayGauge Version1.2 (Fuji Film). Genes in which expression levels changed >2.5-fold in signal intensity between Aβ-treated and untreated samples from each experiment were selected for further quantitative RT-PCR or Northern blotting. Each macroarray experiment was performed in duplicate. Northern Blot Analysis—Poly(A)+RNA from cultured cortical neurons or neurosphere cells was isolated using a Micro-FastTrack 2.0 kit (Invitrogen). Aliquots of 2 μg of poly(A) + RNA were denatured, electrophoretically fractionated on a 1.4% agarose, formaldehyde gel, and transferred to a nylon membrane. Hybridization was performed in a solution containing cloned cDNA labeled with [32P]dCTP using a random labeling kit (Roche Applied Science). The radioactivity of the bands was measured using a Bioimage analyzer BAS 2500. RT-PCR Cloning of cDNA and Quantitative Real-time PCR (QRT-PCR)—First-strand cDNA was synthesized from poly(A)+RNA of cultured cortical neurons using SuperScript II and oligo(dT) primers (Invitrogen). PCR was carried out with ELONGase enzyme mix (Invitrogen) and gene-specific primers. Each PCR product was cloned into a pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen). Quantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed using an iCycler iQ detection system (Bio-Rad) with ELON-Gase enzyme mix (Invitrogen), SYBR Green I (1/50000 dilution, Takara) and 400 nm gene-specific primers (Table 1). The results were evaluated with the ICYCLER IQ Real Time Detection System software (Bio-Rad).TABLE 1List of primers for quantitative RT-PCR GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; ACTB, β-actin.GeneForward sequenceReverse sequenceNgn1CTTCTTTCCTGCCCCAGTCTATGGCTCATCTGTCCCTTTTCCAAATCPax6AGTGAATGGGCGGAGTTATGATACAATGAGTCCTGTTGAAGTGGTTCCMash1CCAACTACTCCAACGACTTGAACTCTCCTGCCATCCTGCTTCCAAAGNUDRTCACAGGCTTAGGCTCTGACTTTGCTGGCAGGAGTTTGTTTCCAAGCPG16TTGAGCAATCAGACGGAATGCGTTGGTAAGGAAGGGCAAGTCCErbA α2TGCTGATGAAGGAGAGAGAAGTGCTCACCAAACTGCTGCTCAAGCMYH9GGAGATGGAGAGTGCTGTCAAGTCATTCGGCGGGTCACAACAAATGGCGAPDHCTTCACCACCATGGAGAAGGCATGGACTGTGGTCATGAGCACTBCCAGGGTGTGATGGTGGGTATGGGTCAGAAGTTCAGGGTCAGGATGCCTCTCTTG Open table in a new tab Construction of Mash1—The coding fragment of rat Mash1 cDNA was generated with RT-PCR. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript II (Invitrogen) and gene-specific primers (nucleotides 1546-1525). PCR was carried out with ELONGase Enzyme Mix (Invitrogen) and specific primers (nucleotides 618-641 and 1546-1525). The PCR product was cloned into a pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen), and the nucleotide sequence was analyzed to confirm the authenticity of the rat Mash1 cDNA. The coding fragment of Mash1 with a c-Myc epitope was cloned into the SmaI site of a pIRES-hrGFP-1a expression vector (Stratagene). Transfection—Dissociated cells from 7DIV neurospheres were fed for 16 h in growth medium on gelatin-polyornithine-coated dishes. The constructs were transfected to the monolayer culture of neural stem cells with Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's manual (Invitrogen). To induce the differentiation of neurosphere cells, the medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 containing 1% fetal bovine serum and lacking FGF2 and FGF 24 h after transfection, and neurosphere cells were cultured for an additional 24 h. RNA Interference—Three types of 21-oligonucleotide siRNA for Olig2 and a scramble control (5′-CCAUUACCCUAUCGAUCGATT-3′), designed as described on the Invitrogen or Takara webpage, respectively, were purchased from Takara. To select effective siRNA, monolayer neurosphere cells were transfected with each of 3 siRNAs and cultured for an additional 48 h. Olig2 siRNA#535 (5′-GCGCGAAACUACAUCCUGATT-3′) was chosen as the most effective by Western blotting using anti-Olig2 antibodies. Immunofluorescence for Cells—Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, treated with 0.3% Triton X-100 for 10 min, blocked with 2% skim milk for 30 min, and reacted with primary antibodies for 1 h followed by a 1-h reaction with secondary antibodies. For the quantification of apoptosis, cells were incubated with 10 μm Hoechst 33342 in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline without Ca2+ and Mg2+ for 10 min. Immunofluorescence was visualized with an Olympus epifluorescence microscope. To estimate the density of Mash1-expressing cells, they were counted in the area occupied by 1000 βIII-tubulin-expressing neurons in each experiment, because they were not uniformly distributed in culture dishes but, rather, had a patchy distribution. For the characterization of Mash1-expressing cells, cells expressing lineage-specific markers were counted in at least 100 Mash1-expressing cells in each experiment. Apoptotic cells were counted in at least 300 transfected cells for each construct and in each transfection experiment. Immunofluorescence for Mouse Brain Sections—Immunofluorescence of frozen mouse brain was performed according to above protocols. After immunofluorescence, brain sections were treated with 10 mm CuSO4 in 50 mm ammonium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) for 30 min for quenching autofluorescence of lipofuscin pigment inside neurons in aged mice brains (18Schnell S.A. Staines W.A. Wessendorf M.W. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 719-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). For the quantification of Mash1- or Olig2-expressing cells in cerebral cortices of Tg2576 and wild-type mice, they were counted on a 180,000-μm2 area within frontoparietal gray matter in each section. Quantification was performed in three sections per animal by means of Win Roof (Mitani) connected to an Olympus epifluorescence microscope. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were extracted with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 2 mm EDTA and protease inhibitors and centrifuged for 20 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C. The nuclear fractions, prepared from cultured cells using the Qproteome nuclear protein kit (Qiagen), were extracted with 2% SDS. The lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (a 5-15% acrylamide linear gradient gel). After transferring to Immobilon, proteins were detected with specific antibodies using the enhanced chemiluminescence method. Antibodies—The primary antibodies used were polyclonal anti-Myc-tag antibodies (MBL), a monoclonal anti-Mash1 (Pharmingen), a monoclonal anti-nestin antibody (Rat401, Chemicon), polyclonal anti-nestin antibodies (IBL), a monoclonal anti-βIII-tubulin (TUJ1, Berkeley Antibody Co., Inc.), a monoclonal anti-GFAP (GA5, Oncogene Science), polyclonal anti-Olig2 antibodies (IBL), and a monoclonal anti-human Aβ-(11-28) (12B2, IBL). Secondary antibodies were Texas Red-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Vector), Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG2a or anti-rabbit IgG, and Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1 (Molecular Probes). Immunoadsorbed Mash1 antibody was prepared using the following protocols. The coding fragment of Mash1 with a c-Myc epitope was cloned into pGEX 4T-3 expression vector (Amersham Biosciences). Transformed BL21 cells were grown in the presence of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and the cell lysate was applied to GSH-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Biosciences). After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, a monoclonal anti-Mash1 (Pharmingen) was applied to the column, which was again washed with 5 volumes of phosphate-buffered saline. The washings were pooled and used for immunoblotting. Gene Expression Results—We first identified the cell populations in our cortical cultures using antibodies against lineage-specific markers; anti-βIII-tubulin antibody for neurons, anti-nestin for immature cells, anti-GalC for oligodendrocytes, and anti-GFAP for astrocytes. Immunolabeling of lineage-specific markers revealed that our cortical cultures included a large fraction of βIII-tubulin+ neurons (90.1 ± 1.4 or 68.6 ± 0.8% of total cells in 3 or 6 DIV cultures, respectively) and a small fraction of nestin+ immature cells (13.6 ± 1.4 or 24.3 ± 4.4% of total cells in 3 or 6 DIV cultures, respectively). A few GFAP+ cells (5.8 ± 1.4% of total cells) appeared in 6 DIV cultures, but no GalC+ oligodendrocytes were detected in 6 DIV cultures. When 6 DIV cortical cultures were treated with 5 μm Aβ-(1-42), the neuronal viability began to decrease after 6 h and continuously decreased for at least up to 48 h, resulting in 91, 87, 85, and 66% of the untreated control viability after 6, 15, 24, and 48 h of treatment, respectively (19Uchida Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 366-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The viability of nestin+ cells did not decrease, at least up to 15 h of treatment. RNA isolated from cortical cultures at 3 h (before neurodegeneration) and 15 h (slight neurodegeneration) after treatment with Aβ was used to generate hybridization probes for use with a nylon DNA macroarray with 1176 genes. An intensity of 30 was used as the cutoff value of the radioactive signal intensity because this was a meaningful signal higher than the background level. We used a 2.5-fold change in signal intensity between Aβ-treated and untreated samples as the cutoff line. Using these criteria, we identified 34 up-regulated genes at 3 h (early responsive) and 26 up-regulated genes at 15 h (late responsive) after Aβ treatment, respectively. Gene expression analysis of E20 embryonic rat brain using the same type of macroarray revealed that 65% of early responsive genes to Aβ and 50% of late responsive genes to Aβ were embryonic genes. To verify the array results, we performed QRT-PCT or Northern blotting. Among 13 fetal genes identified as late responsive genes to Aβ, only the Mash1 gene was thereby confirmed to be up-regulated (Table 2). The expression of other transcription factors, such as Mash2, neuroD2, and neurogenin 1, was not altered by Aβ treatment. To determine whether Aβ but not synthetic peptides with the reverse sequence of Aβ induces Mash1 expression, we compared the levels of Mash1 transcripts in cortical cultures treated with Aβ or synthetic peptides with the reverse sequence of Aβ-(1-42) (R42) or Aβ-(1-40) (R40) by QRT-PCR. Only Aβ-(1-42), but not R42 or R40, was able to induce Mash1 gene expression (the relative levels of Mash1 to β-actin transcripts were (2.37 ± 0.05)e - 04, (3.17 ± 0.31)e - 04, (2.19 ± 0.17)e - 04, and (1.93 ± 0.19)e - 04 in cortical cells treated with minimum essential medium with N2 supplement, Aβ-(1-42), R42, or R40, respectively; p < 0.05, mean ± S.E., n = 5). To examine whether there was an increase in Mash1 protein, we performed Western blotting on 3 or 6 DIV neuronal cultures that were treated with 5 μm Aβ-(1-42) for 18 h (Fig. 1A). The intensity of the 34-kDa band (authentic Mash1 band) in neuronal cultures was not altered by 5 μm Aβ treatment; however, an additional immunoreactive band (about 70 kDa) appeared in the Aβ-treated cultures but not in the control cultures. The 70-kDa band in the Aβ-treated cultures disappeared when immunoadsorbed Mash1 antibody was used for detection (data not shown). To characterize the 70-kDa band, we performed Western blotting on cytosolic and nuclear fractions separated from cells treated with Aβ-(1-42) or reverse peptide R42. The 70-kDa band appeared only in the nuclear fraction from cells treated with Aβ-(1-42) but not with R42 (Fig. 1B), indicating that the 70-kDa band may be Mash1-related. The 70-kDa band was not detected with anti-Aβ-(1-16) antibody in the Mash1 immunoprecipitate generated from Aβ-treated cells (Fig. 1C), indicating that the 70-kDa band was not a complex with Aβ. Thus, the total Mash1 protein level increased with Aβ treatment, consistent with the mRNA level. In contrast, Olig2 protein level decreased with Aβ treatment (Fig. 1A). Next, we examined whether Aβ but not reverse peptides alters the expression of Olig2 protein. Only Aβ-(1-42) but not reverse peptide R42 was able to reduce Olig2 protein in nuclear fractions from cortical cells (Fig. 1B). The relative Olig2 levels to p62 were 1.35 ± 0.03, 0.55 ± 0.05, and 1.11 ± 0.07 in nuclear fractions from cortical cells treated with minimum essential medium with N2 supplement, Aβ-(1-42), R42, respectively (p < 0.001, mean ± S.E., n = 3). Thus, alteration of Mash1 and Olig2 expression by Aβ is not a nonspecific response of cells to high concentrations of non-toxic peptides. To determine whether the increase in Mash1 and the decrease in Olig2 in Aβ-treated cells depended on the concentration of Aβ or state of aggregation, we treated 3 DIV neuronal cell cultures with various concentrations of non-aggregated or aggregated Aβ-(1-42) for 18 h (Fig. 1D). We also examined whether the alteration of Mash1 and Olig2 expression is a common feature of the response of cells to damage by free radicals. An increase in the authentic Mash1 band was clearly observed when cells were treated with 1 μm non-aggregated Aβ or with 0.5-1.0 μm aggregated Aβ. The increase of the 70-kDa immunoreactive band was only detected in cultures treated with a higher concentration (5 μm) of non-aggregated or aggregated Aβ. In contrast to Aβ, 50% oxygen exposure, which induces cell death via free radicals, did not increase the total Mash1 protein level. A decrease in Olig2 expression was observed when cells were treated with 5 μm non-aggregated or aggregated Aβ or with 50% oxygen exposure. Thus, 1 μm or a higher concentration of Aβ-(1-42), independent of the state of aggregation, induces Mash1, whereas a higher concentration of Aβ-(1-42) is necessary to reduce Olig2. Moreover, the induction of Mash1 may be an Aβ-specific phenomenon, whereas the reduction of Olig2 may be a common feature of the response to cell damage.TABLE 2Aß-induced developmentally regulated genes in cerebral cortical cells QRT-PCR values are the means ± S.E. of six determinations.

Immunolabeling with anti-Mash1 antibody indicated that 7.1 ± 0.3 and 11.5 ± 0.9% of total cells expressed Mash1 in 3 and 6 DIV cultures, respectively. To define which type of cells in cerebral cortical cultures overexpress Mash1 in response to Aβ treatment, we performed double or triple immunocytochemistry on cortical cells treated with 5 μm Aβ-(1-42) for 18 h by using antibodies against Mash1 and lineage-specific markers. Most Mash1-expressing cells (about 90%) were labeled with anti-nestin, but few were labeled with anti-βIII-tubulin antibody in untreated cultures at 3 or 6 DIV (Fig. 2, A and B), indicating that Mash1 is not expressed in cortical neurons but is rather expressed in non-neuronal dividing cells. Aβ treatment of 3 or 6 DIV cultures did not alter the proportion of βIII-tubulin+/Mash1+ cells (Fig. 3B).

https://openalex.org/W2060363063,"Genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), which play a critical role in immune recognition, influence mating preference and other social behaviors in mice. Training experiments using urine scent from mice differing only in the MHC complex, from MHC class I mutants or from knock-out mice lacking functional MHC class I molecules (beta2m-deficient), suggest that these behavioral effects are mediated by differences in MHC-dependent volatile components. In search for the physical basis of these behavioral studies, we have conducted a comparison of urinary volatiles in three sub-strains of C57BL/6 mice, a beta2m-deficient mutant lacking functional MHC class I expression and two unrelated inbred strains, using the technique of sorptive extraction with polydimethylsiloxan and subsequent analysis by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. We show (i) that qualitative differences occur between different inbred strains but not in mice with the C57BL/6 background, (ii) that the individual variability in abundance in the same mouse strain is strongly component-dependent, (iii) that C57BL/6 sub-strains obtained from different provenance show a higher fraction of quantitative differences than a sub-strain and its beta2m-mutant obtained from the same source and (iv) that comparison of the spectra of beta2m mice and the corresponding wild type reveals no qualitative differences in close to 200 major and minor components and only minimal differences in a few substances from an ensemble of 69 selected for quantitative analysis. Our data suggest that odor is shaped by ontogenetic, environmental and genetic factors, and the gestalt of this scent may identify a mouse on the individual and population level; but, within the limits of the ensemble of components analysed, the results do not support the notion that functional MHC class I molecules influence the urinary volatile composition."
https://openalex.org/W1992201945,"Background Pre-mRNA splicing, the removal of introns from RNA, takes place within the spliceosome, a macromolecular complex composed of five small nuclear RNAs and a large number of associated proteins. Spliceosome assembly is modulated by the 5′ and 3′ splice site consensus sequences situated at the ends of each intron, as well as by exonic and intronic splicing enhancers/silencers recognized by SR and hnRNP proteins. Nonsense mutations introducing a premature termination codon (PTC) often result in the activation of cellular quality control systems that reduce mRNA levels or alter the mRNA splicing pattern. The mdx mouse, a commonly used genetic model for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), lacks dystrophin by virtue of a premature termination codon (PTC) in exon 23 that also severely reduces the level of dystrophin mRNA. However, the effect of the mutation on dystrophin RNA processing has not yet been described. Methodology/Principal Finding Using combinations of different biochemical and cellular assays, we found that the mdx mutation partially disrupts a multisite exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) that is recognized by a 40 kDa SR protein. In spite of the presence of an inefficient intron 22 3′ splice site containing the rare GAG triplet, the mdx mutation does not activate nonsense-associated altered splicing (NAS), but induces exclusively nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). Functional binding sites for SR proteins were also identified in exon 22 and 24, and in vitro experiments show that SR proteins can mediate direct association between exon 22, 23, and 24. Conclusions/Significance Our findings highlight the complex crosstalk between trans-acting factors, cis-elements and the RNA surveillance machinery occurring during dystrophin mRNA processing. Moreover, they suggest that dystrophin exon–exon interactions could play an important role in preventing mdx exon 23 skipping, as well as in facilitating the pairing of committed splice sites."
https://openalex.org/W2112501668,"N-type inactivation in voltage-gated K+ (Kv) channels is a widespread means to modulate neuronal excitability and signaling. Here we have shown a novel mechanism of N-type inactivation in a Caenorhabditis elegans Kv channel. The N-terminal sequence of KVS-1 contains a domain of 22 amino acids that resembles the inactivation ball in A-type channels, which is preceded by a domain of eighteen amino acids. Wild type KVS-1 currents can be described as A-type; however, their kinetics are significantly (∼5-fold) slower. When the putative inactivation ball is deleted, the current becomes non-inactivating. Inactivation is restored in non-inactivating channels by diffusion of the missing inactivation domain in the cytoplasm. Deletion of the domain in front of the ball speeds inactivation kinetics ∼5-fold. We conclude that KVS-1 is the first example of a novel type of Kv channel simultaneously possessing an N-inactivating ball preceded by an N inactivation regulatory domain (NIRD) that acts to slow down inactivation through steric mechanisms.

Kusano K. Saito N. J. Physiol. 1961; 155: 470-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 2Llinas R.R. Science. 1988; 242: 1654-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar, 3Rudy B.

Physiol. 1971; 213: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). The name “A-type” stems from the typical profile of these currents, rapid activation at subthreshold voltages followed by fast inactivation (4Connor J.A. Stevens C.F. J. Physiol. 1971; 213: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). In many neurons, A-type channels are usually silent at resting membrane potentials. They, however, transiently activate during the decay of the after-hyperpolarization phase of the action potential, delaying depolarization (5Amberg G.C. Koh S.D. Imaizumi Y. Ohya S. Sanders K.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C583-C595Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, A-type inactivation is a key physiological feature that allows control of the neuronal firing frequency by regulating the interval between consecutive action potentials (4Connor J.A. Stevens C.F. J. Physiol. 1971; 213: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). In the late 70s, Armstrong and Bezanilla (6Armstrong C.M. Bezanilla F. J. Gen. Physiol. 1977; 70: 567-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar), in an effort to explain the mechanism of A-type inactivation, proposed the “ball-and-chain” model, which postulates that a positively charged inactivation particle (the α-ball) on a tether prevents the movement of ions by physically occluding the pore. Using the Drosophila channel Shaker, Hoshi, Zagotta, and Aldrich (7Hoshi T. Zagotta W.N. Aldrich R.W. Science. 1990; 250: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar, 8Zagotta W.N. Hoshi T. Aldrich R.W. Science. 1990; 250: 568-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar) identified the location and molecular composition of the ball. This is composed of the first ±20 amino acids in the N terminus (thus the name “N-type” inactivation) followed by 40 or more residues constituting the chain. The inactivation ball possesses two essential chemical characteristics (Fig. 1): the first half is composed of hydrophobic residues, and the rest has a net positive charge that pushes the ball toward its channel receptor site upon depolarization (9Murrell-Lagnado R.D. Aldrich R.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 102: 949-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 10Murrell-Lagnado R.D. Aldrich R.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 102: 977-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Because of the dynamic nature of N-type inactivation, the details of the mechanisms have been unknown for a long time. Recently, using crystallography, Mackinnon and colleagues (11Zhou M. Morais-Cabral J.H. Mann S. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2001; 411: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 12Long S.B. Campbell E.B. Mackinnon R. Science. 2005; 309: 897-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1858) Google Scholar) have proposed that N inactivation occurs as a sequential reaction; the ball initially binds to the T1 domain surface by electrostatic interactions, and then it enters through the lateral portals that connect the cytoplasm to the inner pore and reaches the inner cavity to eventually impair ion movement. Accessory subunits of the Kvβ family can convert non-inactivating Kvα subunits into A-type channels (13Rettig J. Heinemann S.H. Wunder F. Lorra C. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Pongs O. Nature. 1994; 369: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). These may also possess an inactivation ball, or β-ball, that functions identically to an α-ball. Thus, Kvβ1 and Kvβ3 interact with the Kv1 family of α-subunits and induce rapid inactivation in these channels (13Rettig J. Heinemann S.H. Wunder F. Lorra C. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Pongs O. Nature. 1994; 369: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar, 14Li Y. Um S.Y. McDonald T.V. Neuroscientist. 2006; 12: 199-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 15Heinemann S.H.

Chem. 1998; 273: 35095-35101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar); however, there is one exception. Kv1.6 possesses an N-terminal domain termed the N inactivation prevention (NIP) domain, which neutralizes the β-ball of the Kvβ subunit through electrostatic forces (17Roeper J. Sewing S. Zhang Y. Sommer T. Wanner S.G. Pongs O. Nature. 1998; 391: 390-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A KChIP isoform (KChIP4a) also exhibits a K-channel suppressor (KIS) domain, which abolishes fast inactivation in the Kv4.3 channel (18Holmqvist M.H. Cao J. Hernandez-Pineda R. Jacobson M.D. Carroll K.I. Sung M.A. Betty M. Ge P. Gilbride K.J. Brown M.E. Jurman M.E. Lawson D. Silos-Santiago I. Xie Y. Covarrubias M. Rhodes K.J. Distefano P.S. An W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1035-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The KIS domain, however, profoundly differs from the NIP domain. Whereas NIP antagonizes the inactivation ball, KIS acts on residues around the inner mouth of the pore to alter the gating of Kv4.3. To date, no other cases of channels and/or accessory subunits possessing regulatory domains of N-type inactivation have been reported in the literature. Here we have shown the first example of an α-subunit that simultaneously possesses an inactivation ball and a domain that regulates its function. KVS-1 is a voltage-gated K+ channel that operates in the nervous system of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to maintain and modulate cell sensitivity (19Bianchi L. Kwok S.M. Driscoll M. Sesti F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12415-12424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Even though the KVS-1 current can be described as A-type, its inactivation is considerably slower than normal. We discovered that, in fact, KVS-1 possesses both a functional inactivation ball and a receptor. In addition, KVS-1 exhibits a domain in front of the ball (here named N inactivation regulatory domain (NIRD)) that modulates the kinetics of inactivation. NIRD is different from NIP and KIS in several respects. It co-exists with the ball in the same subunit and slows down inactivation by a mechanism that is best described as steric. Thus, KVS-1 provides the first example of a novel mechanism of regulation of N-type inactivation. Molecular Biology—KVS-1 mutants were constructed by PCR. For biochemistry, KVS-1 was epitope-tagged by replacing the terminal stop codon with nucleotides encoding HA residues (YPYDVPDYA-STOP). The constructs were subcloned into pcI-neo vector (Promega) for expression in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. All sequences were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. Transcripts were quantified with spectroscopy and compared with control samples separated by agarose gel electrophoresis stained with ethidium bromide. Electrophysiology—CHO cells were transiently transfected with cDNA using the Superfect kit (Qiagen) and studied 24-36 h post-transfection. Data were recorded with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon), a Dell personal computer, and Clampex software (Axon) after cells were filtered at fc = 1 kHz and sampled at 2.5 kHz. Bath solution was (in mm) 4 KCl, 100 NaCl, 10 Hepes (pH = 7.5 with NaOH), 1.8 CaCl2 and 1.0 MgCl2. The pipette solution included 100 KCl, 10 Hepes (pH = 7.5 with KOH), 1.0 MgCl2, 1.0 CaCl2, and 10 EGTA (pH = 7.5 with KOH). Whole-cell currents were evoked by 200-ms voltage sweeps from a holding potential of -80 to +120 mV in 20-mV increments. The time course of activation and inactivation was fitted to a single exponential function as follows, i=i0e-t/τ(Eq. 1) where I0 is a constant and τ is the value at which Equation 1 = 0.37. Macroscopic conductance (G) curves were calculated as, G=iV-Vrev(Eq. 2) where I is the macroscopic current and Vrev is the resting potential. G/Gmax curves were fitted to the Boltzmann function, GGmax=11+EXP[(V1/2-V)/VS](Eq. 3) where V is the membrane voltage, V½ is the value of the voltage at which Equation 2 = 0.5 and VS is the slope coefficient (in mV). Data are presented as means ± S.E. The number of determinations is indicated by n. Statistical significance of unpaired groups was estimated with the Student's t test. Synthetic Peptide—Peptides encoded by the sequence MVIPSTRKGHAASRDNFGNSNH (Δ19-40) and MSTERLMYLDLNKGNQIAMVIPSTRKGHAASRDNFGNSNH (Δ1-40) were synthesized dry at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey peptide synthesis core facility. Prior to the experiment, the peptides were freshly diluted in the pipette solution to a final concentration of 10 nm. Immunoprecipitations—CHO cells were washed with 10 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with ∼2 ml of ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% IGEPAL CA-630, 0.5% (w/v) deoxycholate, and 0.1% (w/v) SDS) and freshly added 10 mm iodoacetamide, phosphatase, and protease inhibitors for 30 min at 4 °C. Cell lysates were centrifuged for 60 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was mixed with HA-conjugated beads (Roche Applied Science) and rocked at 4 °C for 3 h. The beads were washed three times with ice-cold TBST (8.8 g of NaCl, 0.2 g of KCl, 3 g of Tris base, 500 μl of Tween 20, pH to 7.4, H2O to 1 liter) and incubated in SDS sample buffer at ∼90-95 °C for 15 min. Membrane Biotinylation—30 h after transfection, the CHO cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature (22-25 °C), and cell surface proteins were biotinylated by 1.0 mg/ml impermeant biotin analog EZ-link sulfo-NHS-Lcbiotin (Pierce) in phosphate-buffered saline. After incubation at 4 °C for 1 h, the cells were washed five times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline to remove any remaining biotinylation reagent. Cells were then harvested in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Lysate proteins were precipitated by streptoavidin-agarose-linked beads. The precipitated KVS-1 was detected by monoclonal anti-HA antibodies (Roche Applied Science). A 22-amino-acid domain (Δ19-40) (Fig. 1) in the N terminus of KVS-1 (dubbed K1 in this “Result” section) exhibited homology to the N-inactivating domains in several A-type α- and β-subunits (7Hoshi T.

Chem. 2006; 281: 30725-30735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This suggests that inactivation in K1 might proceed through a N-type mechanism. To determine whether Δ19-40 is an inactivation ball, we constructed a panel of K1 truncation mutants and used the whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp to characterize currents. KVS-1 Possesses an N Inactivation Ball—In CHO cells, wild type (wt) K1 channels express robust voltage-dependent K+ currents exhibiting fast activation and inactivation (Fig. 2A). The voltage dependence of the extent of inactivation, expressed as the ratio between the residual and the peak current, is sharp (∼12.7 ± 0.7 mV) with a midpoint at 45.5 ± 7 mV (Fig. 2B). The time course of inactivation, which is best fit with a single exponential function (Equation 1), weakly depends on the membrane voltage (Fig. 2C). Thus, the characteristic of the K1 current is A-type overall. However, compared with normal fast inactivating channels, the kinetics of K1 inactivation are considerably slower (∼5-fold). Therefore, the time constant of inactivation represents the best parameter to describe changes in inactivation in wt or mutant K1 channels. Complete or partial deletion of the putative inactivation domain (Fig. 2A, K1Δ40) (K1Δ30 not shown) suppressed most of the inactivation. The current exhibited a residual time-dependent decline, suggesting that multiple inactivation mechanisms may co-exist in K1. The magnitude of the current in K1Δ40 and K1Δ30 (not shown) was roughly 2-fold larger than in wt channels. The level of K1Δ40 protein as well as its expression in the plasma membrane were not significantly different (Fig. 2F). This ruled out effects due to altered channel biosynthesis, trafficking, or abundance in the membrane. The midpoint for voltage activation (V½) was shifted ∼8 mV to the left in the K1Δ40 mutant compared with wt channels (Fig. 2D). In contrast, the kinetics of activation did not significantly differ in the two channel types (Fig. 2E). These observations are consistent with the notion that the current increase in K1Δ40 and K1Δ30 was because of the removal of N-type inactivation. Under normal conditions, N inactivation does not allow the current to reach saturation. Thus, an increase in the current upon removal of the ball was expected, and it was, in fact, observed in several A-type channels (e.g. see Ref. 20Kondoh S. Ishii K. Nakamura Y. Taira N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19333-19338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Alternative mechanisms such as increased unitary current are also possible, but they seem unlikely considering that the N terminus is not expected to contribute to the ion conduction pathway. Synthetic Δ19-40 Peptide Restores N-type Inactivation in K1Δ40 Mutants—The ball-and-chain model makes predictions that can be tested: if deletion of the inactivating ball eliminates inactivation, then diffusion of the missing piece into the cytoplasm should restore inactivation. Therefore, to corroborate the notion that Δ19-40 is an inactivation ball and to ascertain whether K1 possesses a functional ball receptor, we synthesized a synthetic Δ19-40 peptide and assessed its ability to inactivate K1Δ40 mutant channels. Addition of the inactivation peptide to the pipette solution restored inactivation in K1Δ40 channels in a time-dependent fashion, consistent with progressive diffusion of the peptide into the cytoplasm (Fig. 3). As expected, we did not observe any change in the current in the absence of the peptide (Fig. 3B). Moreover, diffusion of a synthetic peptide formed by the first 40 amino acids of KVS-1 (Δ1-40) restored wild type inactivation in K1Δ40 currents (τ120 = 51 ± 7 ms) (Fig. 3B). We conclude that K1 possesses an α-inactivation ball and a functional receptor. Therefore, N-type inactivation is a primary (although not the only) mechanism contributing to the transient behavior of the K1 current. NIRD Hinders N-type Inactivation—The kinetics of inactivation induced by the Δ19-40 peptide were considerably faster than in wt channels (compare them in Fig. 4B). This suggests that the domain in front of the ball might slow down N inactivation in wt channels. As expected, deletion of this domain (Fig. 4, K1Δ18) conferred full A-type attributes to the current. The inactivation in K1Δ18 currents did not significantly differ from that in K1Δ40 currents modified by the inactivating peptide (τ120 = 11.2 ± 3 versus 10.0 ± 4 ms) (Fig. 4B). We conclude that Δ18 specifically acts to modulate N-type inactivation without apparently affecting other gating parameters. Steric Mechanisms Underlie NIRD-mediated Inhibition of Inactivation—To gain insight into the mechanisms underlying NIRD function, we probed the role of electrostatic interactions, which have been shown to play a key role for NIP function (13Rettig J. Heinemann S.H. Wunder F. Lorra C. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Pongs O. Nature. 1994; 369: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, mutation of charged residues to neutral residues or to residues of opposite charge did not induce any apparent modification in the current (Table 1). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and oxidation of methionine have also been shown to modulate N-type inactivation (21Covarrubias M. Wei A. Salkoff L. Vyas T.B. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1403-1412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 22Ruppersberg J.P. Stocker M. Pongs O. Heinemann S.H. Frank R. Koenen M.

Notably, neutralization of a protein kinase C consensus site in NIRD (T3V) or mutation of its methionines (M7L, M19L) gave rise to mutant channels that did not significantly differ from wt (Table 1). Conversely, progressive deletion of NIRD gradually accelerated inactivation in a fashion that did not depend on the overall electrical charge of NIRD (Fig. 5). We conclude that the NIRD acts primarily to slow down N-type inactivation through steric mechanisms.TABLE 1Mutation of charged residuesVariantCurrent densityτ120V½pA/pFmsmVWild type202 ± 2338.9 ± 4.547.3 ± 4.0T3A200 ± 3238.7 ± 5.445.4 ± 3.5M7L187 ± 2742.3 ± 6.249.4 ± 4.6D10N197 ± 3949.3 ± 10.250.3 ± 6.3D10K216 ± 2537.5 ± 4.748.5 ± 5.1K13Q205 ± 1638.5 ± 5.745.6 ± 4.2K13E185 ± 2339.0 ± 4.243.9 ± 6.0M20L198 ± 3543.3 ± 6.747.5 ± 3.8 Open table in a new tab Electrophysiological and biochemical analyses support the following conclusions. First, KVS-1 is an A-type channel. It has both a functional N-inactivating ball and a ball receptor. Second, KVS-1 possesses a domain in front of the ball (NIRD) that modulates the kinetics of N inactivation. The primary sequence of NIRD as well as its function lead us to conclude that NIRD represents a new mode of A-type current modulation. To date, only two examples of N-terminal domains that can act to regulate N inactivation (NIP and KIS) have been reported. KIS affects multiple gating parameters in Kv4.3, including activation (18Holmqvist M.H. Cao J. Hernandez-Pineda R. Jacobson M.D. Carroll K.I. Sung M.A. Betty M. Ge P. Gilbride K.J. Brown M.E. Jurman M.E. Lawson D. Silos-Santiago I. Xie Y. Covarrubias M. Rhodes K.J. Distefano P.S. An W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1035-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In contrast, NIP specifically antagonizes N-type inactivation in heteromeric Kv1.6-Kvβ channels (17Roeper J. Sewing S. Zhang Y. Sommer T. Wanner S.G. Pongs O. Nature. 1998; 391: 390-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). NIRD differs from NIP and KIS in several respects. First, the ball and NIRD co-exist in the same subunit. Second, NIRD does not abolish N inactivation nor does it affect other gating parameters. Its mode of action is also different from those of the other domains. Although NIP exploits electrostatic forces and KIS binds to the inner mouth of the pore, the mechanism by which NIRD hinders inactivation is best described as steric. The details of the mechanism are not completely elucidated. NIRD might either decrease the affinity of the ball for its receptor, or alternatively, it might hamper its progression into the pore of the channel. Nonetheless, in the light of the known three-dimensional structures of Kv channels, these findings unveil unexpected insights into the molecular mechanisms of N-type inactivation. Suppression of N inactivation in KVS-1 revealed the existence of secondary inactivation mechanisms. This is not unexpected, as many Kv channels exhibit multiple forms of inactivation that involve slow and fast processes. For example, two forms of inactivation (N-type and C-type) co-exist in Shaker (25Hoshi T. Zagotta W.N. Aldrich R.W. Neuron. 1991; 7: 547-556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). C-type inactivation is produced by rearrangements of the external mouth of the pore that involve movements of S6 and the S5-S6 linker (26Lopez-Barneo J. Hoshi T. Heinemann S.H. Aldrich R.W. Recept. Channels. 1993; 1: 61-71PubMed Google Scholar, 27Ogielska E.M. Zagotta W.N. Hoshi T. Heinemann S.H. Haab J. Aldrich R.W. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 2449-2457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The C terminus can also be a source of inactivation in Kv channels (28Jerng H.H. Shahidullah M. Covarrubias M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 641-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The attributes of non N-type inactivation in KVS-1 are more consistent with a C-type mechanism than a C terminus mechanism, because this domain is remarkably small. Furthermore, accessory subunits might also contribute to secondary mechanisms of inactivation. In native tissue, KVS-1 forms a complex with MPS-1, a bifunctional β-subunit that possesses kinase activity (29Cai S.Q. Hernandez L. Wang Y. Park K.H. Sesti F. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1503-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). When MPS-1 is co-expressed with KVS-1 in CHO cells, it accelerates the rate of inactivation through mechanisms that are independent of its enzymatic activity. This implies that MPS-1 might either interfere with N-type inactivation, with secondary mechanisms of inactivation, or induce de novo inactivation. Even though a complete elucidation of these issues is beyond the scope of this study, we can rule out that MPS-1 interferes with N-type inactivation. When MPS-1 was co-expressed with K1Δ40, the channel inactivated (data not shown). The most likely explanation for these effects is that they result from structural rearrangements in the channel protein induced by the incorporation of MPS-1. A-type inactivation is a key attribute of neuronal K+ channels. This explains why this gating characteristic can be controlled by multiple, often redundant mechanisms. It can be regulated through the formation of heteromeric complexes of distinct A-type α-subunits and/or α and β-subunits by signaling molecules, including protein kinases and post-translational modifications (13Rettig J.

We are currently testing whether in vivo deletion of NIRD is a physiological mechanism of regulation of neuronal excitability. Hence, exciting questions lay ahead that we expect will provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms determining K+ channel function.

We found that dissimilar but comparably located TLC1 palindromes from other sensu stricto yeasts can functionally substitute for that of S. cerevisiae. Yeast cells expressing dimerization-defective TLC1 alleles have shorter telomeres than those with wild-type TLC1.

Found in all eukaryotes, it is a multimolecular complex of which the minimal components are a catalytic RT protein (TERT) and an integral RNA template. TERT proteins from diverse mammalian, protozoan, and yeast species appear to be related to one another evolutionarily as well as to RTs from retroviruses and cellular retroelements (2Lingner J.

Telomerase RNAs, by contrast, differ widely in length and primary sequence, and their phylogenetic relationships to one another and to retroviral genomes, if any, are unclear. Certain properties that are shared among groups of retroviral or telomerase RNAs may indicate either a common evolutionary origin or the convergent evolution of features involved in RT function. Widely divergent telomerase RNAs, for example, share certain core secondary structures that are critical for telomerase activity but have no obvious counterparts in retroviral RNAs (5Lin J. Ly H.

The single-stranded RNA genomes of retroviruses, on the other hand, share a tendency to form stable RNA homodimers that are found in all known retroviral particles and appear to be the natural substrates for viral RTs (reviewed in Ref. 7Paillart J.C. Shehu-Xhilaga M. Marquet R. Mak J. Nat Rev Microbiol. 2004; 2: 461-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The assembly of these viral genomic dimers is generally initiated at a specific palindrome (i.e. a self-complementary base sequence), unique to each virus, that dimerizes readily both in vitro and within cells, and mutations in these palindromes that disrupt genomic dimer formation can markedly impair viral replication and infectivity (7Paillart J.C. Shehu-Xhilaga M. Marquet R. Mak J. Nat Rev Microbiol. 2004; 2: 461-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). RNAs derived from at least some cellular retroelements undergo similar dimerization (4Feng Y.X. Moore S.P. Garfinkel D.J. Rein A. J.

Unexpectedly, studies from our laboratory and others have recently shown that the human telomerase RNA also dimerizes readily and that this capacity to dimerize correlates with telomerase catalytic activity in cells or cell-free extracts (8Wenz C. Enenkel B. Amacker M. Kelleher C. Damm K. Lingner J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3526-3534Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 9Ly H. Xu L. Rivera M.A. Parslow T.G. Blackburn E.H. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1078-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that RNA dimerization plays a fundamental role in telomerase biology.In this study, we show that the telomerase RNA of Saccharomyces cerevisiae also forms dimers in vitro, although it otherwise bears little resemblance to its human counterpart. Yeast cells harboring a dimerization-defective allele of TLC1 exhibit a progressive telomere shortening effect over successive generations. Collectively, these results provide evidence that RNA template dimerization is a widely conserved property of reverse transcription in both cellular and retroviral contexts.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Strain—Yeast strain yEHB1002 (MATα ade2::hisG his3Δ200 leu2Δ0 lys2D0 met15Δ0 trp1Δ63 ura3Δ0 tlc1:: TRP1pRS316TLC1) was constructed by disruption of the TLC1 gene with TRP1 (10Prescott J. Blackburn E.H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 528-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) (a generous gift of Dr. Elizabeth Blackburn at University of California, San Francisco). The strain carries a CEN/ARS, URA3 plasmid containing the wild-type TLC1 with its endogenous promoter and terminator sequence.In Vitro TLC1 RNA Dimerization Assay—RNAs were transcribed directly from PCR products containing either the full-length wild-type TLC1 sequence or various mutated or truncated versions of this gene using the MEGAscript kit as suggested by the manufacturer (Ambion, Austin, TX). TLC1 RNA was first denatured in a total of 8 μl of diethylpyrocarbonate water at 95 °C for 3 min and then immediately snap-cooled on ice for an additional 3 min. Two μl of 5× dimerization buffer (250 mm NaCl, 123 mm Tris (pH 7.0), 50 mm MgCl2) was added to each sample. The samples were either incubated on ice (0 °C) or at 37 °C for 120 min and then separated by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis in 90 mm Tris borate, 0.1 mm MgCl2. The percentage of RNA dimerization (% dimers) was calculated by dividing the intensity of the dimeric RNA band, as judged by NIH Image software, to the sum of both monomeric and dimeric RNA species in each lane.Southern Blot Analysis of Telomeres—Various TLC1 mutants created on the pRS313TLC1 plasmid were transformed into yeast strain yEHB1002 using the method described previously (5Lin J. Ly H. Hussain A. Abraham M. Pearl S. Tzfati Y. Parslow T.G. Blackburn E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14713-14718Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In some instances, two separate pRS313TLC1 plasmids carrying either the 42C or 42G mutant were co-transformed into yEHB1002 cells. Transformants were selected on agar plates that contained –Ura–His medium to retain both wild-type and mutant plasmids. Individual colonies were then streaked on plates that contain 5-flouroorotic acid-His to select against the wild-type copy of TLC1. Colonies were subsequently streaked on –His plate. Genomic DNA was isolated from cells at each streak, restriction digested with XhoI, separated on 0.8% agarose/Tris borate-EDTA, and transferred onto Nytran membrane (Schleicher & Schuell BioScience). The membrane was hybridized with a γ-32P-end-labeled probe, (TGTGGG)4, and visualized using a phosphorimaging technique (GE Healthcare).Northern Blot Analysis of TLC1—Total cellular RNAs (15 μg) isolated from yeast cells (yeast RNA purification system, Puregene, Minneapolis, MN) that carried either the wild-type copy or the different mutant versions of TLC1 and 1 ng of the in vitro transcribed 1,300-nt TLC1 RNA were treated with glyoxal prior to loading into a 1% agarose gel. After separation, the RNAs were transferred onto the Hybond membrane (Schleicher & Schuell Bioscience), UV-cross-linked, and hybridized to a TLC1 probe that was labeled by random priming (Amersham Biosciences) with [α-32P]dCTP. RNA markers (0.16–1.77 and 0.24–9.5 kb) purchased from Invitrogen were also similarly treated but were visualized by a methylene blue staining method (11Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.3rd Ed. Vol. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 7.36-7.39Google Scholar). The radiolabeled TLC1 RNAs on the membrane were exposed onto a phosphorimaging screen and analyzed. The membrane was stripped and rehybridized to a randomly primed probe corresponding to the yeast Tubulin-1 gene (a kind gift from Dr. Anita Corbett, Emory University) and visualized via a phosphorimaging technique (GE Healthcare).TLC1 Mutagenesis and Sequencing—Palindromic sequences located within the 3′ region of TLC1 were mutated by PCR mutagenesis (QuikChange mutagenesis kit, Strategene, La Jolla, CA) using pRS313 as the DNA template and primer pairs that contained the desired nucleotide substitutions or deletions. Similar strategy was used to replace the palindromic sequence of the S. cerevisiae with those of the other yeast strains shown in Fig. 4 (boxed sequences). Potential mutants, selected and sequenced in both directions to verify the desired changes, were used as templates for RNA transcription and for transformation into yeast cells. Plasmids containing various TLC1 sequences were isolated from yeast cells using the plasmid DNA purification system (Puregene, Minneapolis, MN) and sequenced. In the instance in which two plasmids expressing the dimerization complementation mutations were extracted from a single yeast cell, the mixture of the plasmids was extracted and transformed (by electroporation) into Escherichia coli. Plasmid DNAs were prepared using the Qiagen Miniprep kit (Qiagen) and submitted for sequencing to verify the identity of each of the dimerization mutant and that no inadvertent recombination had occurred between the two constructs.RESULTSNumerous reports demonstrate that synthetic transcripts representing specific portions of human telomerase RNA or of retroviral genomes dimerize spontaneously in vitro under near physiologic conditions (8Wenz C.

Biochimie (Paris). 1996; 78: 639-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In this study, we evaluated a synthetic 1300-nt S. cerevisiae TLC1 RNA under these standard conditions using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and found that it readily formed dimer-sized complexes when warmed to 37 °C (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 3). Systematic truncation further revealed that a 416-nt TLC1 fragment comprising nts 885–1301 alone formed dimers at even higher efficiency than the full-length molecule (20–60% versus 15–20%), whereas isolated sequences from farther upstream did not form dimers efficiently (compare Fig. 1B, lanes 7 and 8 with lanes 5, 6, 9, and 10). When this 416-nt 3′ fragment and full-length TLC1 were combined in equal amounts (Fig. 1C, lanes 1–6, 18, and 19), we observed an RNA species migrating at the position predicted for a heterodimer of these two RNAs (double asterisks). Indeed, such heterodimeric RNA species appeared reproducibly to form more readily than would be expected for homodimers of the individual RNA species (Fig. 1C, single asterisks), perhaps because of reduced conformational variability or reduced steric effects on the truncated RNA. These findings confirm that the slow migrating complexes observed on EMSA are indeed dimers, and they suggest that specific sequences within the 3′ region of TLC1 are necessary and sufficient for dimer formation in vitro.FIGURE 1Sequences located within the 3′ region of TLC1 are necessary and sufficient to mediate RNA dimerize in vitro.

Although only a small fraction of the heterodimers can be observed between the 42C- and 42G-containing RNA sequences at 2 h of incubation (lane 15), heterodimers form more readily after 4 h (lane 16) (double asterisk).

We identified five such palindromes in the 3′ TLC1 region and created a series of mutants of this truncated RNA each of which introduced two or three nucleotide substitutions into a given palindrome (Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2B, most of these mutations had no discernible effect on in vitro dimer formation as compared with the wild-type RNA species, with the exception of mutants 42C and 42G, which replaced the native palindrome CGCGCG at positions 1204–1209 with the alternative, non-palindromic sequences CCCCCG and CGGGGG, respectively (Fig. 1C, base substitutions are underlined). Each of the two latter mutations reduced dimerization to nearly undetectable levels (Figs. 1C, lanes 7–13, and 2B, lanes 5 and 6). Further evidence of a unique role for this palindrome was obtained by progressively truncating the 3′ end of the RNA (Fig. 2C). As shown in Fig. 2D, we found that RNAs that lacked up to 88 nt but retained this palindrome dimerized relatively efficiently (lanes 5–10), but that further deletions or base substitutions that eliminated the palindrome abolished dimer formation (lanes 1–4, 11, and 12).FIGURE 2CG-rich palindromic sequence located at positions 1204–1209 in the 3′ RNA fragment is required for TLC1 dimerization.

D, EMSA showing that whereas all RNA fragments that contain the wild-type CG-rich palindromic sequence(WT) at position 1204–1209 (blackboxes) can dimerize efficiently, those that carry either the mutated palindrome or lack this sequence completely (lanes 1–4) fail to form dimers.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The significance of palindromes in dimer initiation reflects their ability to mediate homologous base-pairing interactions between RNA strands. The 42C and 42G mutations replace the native palindrome at positions 1204–1209 with sequences that are nonpalindromic but are complementary to each other and so might be predicted to support heterodimer formation. We tested this possibility by combining a full-length TCL1 that contained the 42G mutation with an equimolar amount of a 416-nt 3′ fragment containing 42C. As shown in Fig. 1C, neither of these mutant RNAs formed appreciable homodimers when incubated alone for either 2 h (lanes 7, 8, 10–13, 20, and 21) or up to 4 h (data not shown), but small amounts of an apparent heterodimer reproducibly formed when the two RNA species were mixed (lanes 15 and 16). Formation of this mutant heterodimer, however, was slow and inefficient in comparison with homodimerization of wild-type TLC1 (Fig. 1C, compare lane 6 with lanes 15 and 16); this is consistent with evidence from retroviral systems that only a small subset of complementary sequences can support dimerization in vitro or in vivo (13Clever J.L. Wong M.L. Parslow T.G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5902-5908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Laughrea M. Jette L. Mak J. Kleiman L. Liang C. Wainberg M.A. J.

Taken together, these results indicate that the palindrome at positions 1204–1209 is required for efficient TLC1 dimer formation in vitro by virtue of its ability to form base pairs between strands.We next asked whether TLC1 dimerization plays a role in the life cycle of yeast cells. To do this, we created artificial expression cassettes encoding wild-type or mutant forms of the full-length TLC1 sequence and introduced these in place of the endogenous TLC1 gene in S. cerevisiae (as outlined under “Experimental Procedures”). Individual transformed yeast clones with the desired genotypes, verified by DNA sequencing, were selected and characterized further by continuous cultivation (i.e. by streaking the same population of cells on agar plates for five successive passages). As shown in Fig. 3A, yeast strains that carried only the wild-type TLC1 allele or the dimerization-competent control mutant 43 grew at roughly comparable rates. In contrast, cells harboring either of the dimerization-defective mutants (42C or 42G) alone grew somewhat more slowly and were less efficiently propagated. It is important to note, however, that neither mutant entered replicative senescence, even by the fifth passage, highlighting the plasticity of yeast cells in cultured conditions. Compound heterozygous cells that contained both the 42C and 42G alleles appeared to grow better than those with either mutant alone (Fig. 3A). Similar results were obtained when similar strains of yeast cells were grown in liquid cultures prior to being serially diluted and spotted onto plates for growth (Fig. 3A, 1–4). These results suggest that the 42C and 42G mutants can at least partially complement each other functionally in trans, presumably because of their ability to form RNA heterodimers.FIGURE 3Yeast cells expressing different versions of the TLC1 dimerization-defective RNA grow more slowly and possess shorter telomeres than those that express the dimerization competent TLC1 molecules. Yeast cells harboring either the wild-type TLC1 RNA, dimerization-defective mutants 42G and 42C (either alone or together) or a dimerization-competent palindromic mutant (Mut 43) were passaged serially by continuous streaking onto fresh agar plates. A, by streak 3, compared with cells that carry either the wild-type TLC1 or Mut 43, those that carry either of the dimerization-defective mutants (42G or 42G) seem to exhibit a slower growth rate, a phenotype that seems to be rescued in cells that carry both versions of the dimerization-defective mutants. At streak 5 (∼100 generations), representative yeast liquid cultures containing the 42C+42G compound heterozygous mutants (1Blackburn E.H. Cell. 2001; 106: 661-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1750) Google Scholar), 42G alone (2Lingner J. Hughes T.R. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Lundblad V. Cech T.R. Science. 1997; 276: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar), 42C alone (3Peng Y. Mian I.S. Lue N.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1201-1211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), or the wild-type TLC1 (4Feng Y.X. Moore S.P. Garfinkel D.J. Rein A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 10819-10821Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) were grown to A600 = 1.0, serially diluted by 1:3 (five serial dilutions), spotted onto a plate, and grown at 30 °C for 3 days. B, Southern blotting analysis of the telomeric DNAs isolated from yeast cells expressing either the wild-type (WT) copy (lanes 1, 2, 9, and 10) or the mutant 43 copy of the TLC1 (lanes 6–8) shows constant telomere length maintenance over successive passaging (streaks 1–5) but progressive telomere shortening effects in cells that express either of the dimerization-defective mutants (lanes 3–5 and 14–18). In contrast, cells that express both copies of the dimerization-defective mutants 42C and 42G (lanes 12 and 13) maintain telomere lengths at levels similar to those that express either the wild-type or mutant 43 copy, suggesting that both mutants 42C and 42G function in trans to restore normal telomerase activity. Lane 11 is empty. C, Northern blotting analysis shows that the dimerization-defective mutants 42G and 42C possess levels of RNA stability similar to that of the wild-type fragment (lanes 1–3 and 7–9). The membrane was first probed for the 1300-nt TLC1 RNA (lanes 1–3) and then reprobed for the 1600-nt cellular α-tubulin-1 RNA (lanes 1′–3′). The 0.24–9.5-kb RNA ladder (Invitrogen) was separated on the same gel and similarly transferred onto the membrane before being stained with methylene blue dye. In vitro transcribed TLC1 RNAs representing the mature 1300-nt form (at 1 ng and 10 ng in lanes 4 and 5, respectively) were separated on the same gel as those RNAs extracted directly from yeast cells (lanes 7–9). Lane 6 is empty.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Further evidence of a possible functional role for TLC1 dimerization was obtained by examining telomere lengths of these same yeast strains by Southern blot analysis (Fig. 3B). Over successive passages, telomere length decreased progressively in yeast that carried the dimerization-defective mutant 42C or 42G alone, whereas it remained roughly constant in yeast carrying wild-type TLC1 or the control dimerization-efficient mutant 43. Despite their abnormal lengths, telomeres in the 42C and 42G single-mutant strains remained stable through five passages, consistent with the nonsenescent phenotype we observed. Moreover, heterozygous yeast expressing the 42C and 42G alleles together maintained roughly normal telomere lengths, again suggesting phenotypic trans-complementation by these two mutant alleles. Collectively, these data are compatible with the view that interstrand base-pairing interactions involving the palindromic residues 1204–1209 of TLC1 may be required for maintenance of optimal telomere length in yeast cells.Efforts to map the 3′ end of yeast TLC1 RNA in vivo have produced conflicting results (19Chapon C.

In the current study, we confirmed by Northern blot (Fig. 3C) that the wild type and each of the dimerization-defective mutants, 42C and 42G, generated stable RNA products that had lengths comparable with the in vitro transcribed 1300-nt TLC1 RNA (lanes 4 and 5).Finally, we searched for functional counterparts of the dimerization-directed palindrome in TLC1 sequences from Saccharomyces cariocanus and Saccharomyces kudriavzevii, two other yeast species that belong to the senso stricto group and in which TLC1 RNAs exhibit 77 and 65% sequence identity overall, respectively, to that of S. cerevisiae (23Dandjinou A.T.

When these sequences are optimally aligned, the regions in question are markedly divergent among the three species but are either palindromic (in the case of S. kudriavzevii) or imperfectly palindromic (in the case of the S. cariocanus) to a degree that would still allow base pairing to occur (Fig. 4A, boxed). As full-length clones of the S. cariocanus and S. kudriavzevii TLC1 genes were not available to us, we were unable to evaluate the dimerization properties of the native RNAs; instead, we asked whether the palindromic sequences from those genes could functionally replace residues 1204–1209 in the context of S. cerevisiae TLC1. Fig. 4B demonstrates that dimerization of the S. cerevisiae RNA was completely abolished when the native palindrome was deleted but could be restored to essentially full efficiency by inserting either the S. cariocanus or the S. kudriavzevii palindrome in its place. Thus, despite wide sequence divergence over the evolutionary history of these species, local palindromic character has been conserved that"

Chem. 1975; 250: 4722-4729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Gershon P.D. Ahn B-Y. Garfield M. Moss B. Cell. 1991; 66: 1269-1278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In the absence of VP39, oligo(A) tails are added to permissive primers by VP55 in a rapid processive burst, which ceases abruptly after tails have reached 30-35 nucleotides in length (7Gershon P.D. Moss B. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1575-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Permissive primers for the burst are ≥33 nt in length and possess a three-uridylate ((rU)2-N15-rU “VP55-binding”) motif positioned ∼10 nt upstream from the 3′-OH (8Deng L. Gershon P.D.

Chem. 1997; 272: 31542-31552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, primers possessing no uridylates other than the VP55-binding motif (9Deng L. Beigelman L. Matulic-Adamic J. Karpeisky A. Gershon P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31542-31552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) receive no more than ∼3-7 adenylates in the burst. With an additional UNUUUUU (“translocatory”) motif positioned at the extreme 3′ end of the initial primer, the full 30-35 adenylate tail can be added (10Johnson L. Liu S. Gershon P.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 843-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). When VP55 is allowed to synthesize its own binding site by conversion to a poly(U) polymerase in the presence of Mn2+, tails hundreds of nucleotides in length are processively synthesized with no abrupt cessation of elongation (11Gershon P.D. Moss B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4705-4714Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), demonstrating translocation of the polymerase to the newly synthesized tail. PAP crystal structures have shed light on non-templated polymerase catalytic mechanism and architecture. The structures of two eukaryotic (bovine and yeast) PAPs have been reported (12Bard J.

Biol. 2000; 7: 819-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), each showing three domains (N-terminal, central, and C-terminal) with the catalytic center in the N-terminal one. This arrangement seems similar to that observed in template-dependent enzymes, except that in the latter, the catalytic center is located in the central domain (12Bard J. Zhelkovsky A.M. Helmling S.

Although bovine and yeast PAPs are structurally very similar to one another, their interaction with substrate analogs appears to be distinct (13Gershon P.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 819-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 15Hall T.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). More recently, the crystal structure for the vaccinia VP55-VP39 heterodimer was solved (16Moure C.M. Bowman B.R. Gershon P.D. Quiocho F.A. Mol. Cell. 2006; 33: 339-349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (24) Google Scholar), providing insight into the catalytic mechanism, the mode of ATP binding, and the architecture of a PAP-processivity factor complex. The vaccinia PAP showed no structural homology to eukaryotic PAPs outside the immediate vicinity of the catalytic center, and although a three-domain architecture could be perceived, the catalytic center was in the central, not the N-terminal, domain (16Moure C.M. Bowman B.R. Gershon P.D. Quiocho F.A. Mol. Cell. 2006; 33: 339-349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, other than VP55, none of the reported non-templated nucleic acid polymerases, including eukaryotic and other PAPs, are known to fully translocate with respect to their primers. For example, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (the only reported template-independent DNA polymerase) does not translocate but adopts a strictly non-processive mode of nucleotide addition (17Delarue M. Boule J.B. Lescar J. Expert-Bezancon N. Jourdan N. Sukumar N. Rougeon F. Papanicolaou C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 427-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic PAPs appear to remain tethered via the protein complex CstF/CPSF and/or other components of the mRNA cleavage/polyadenylation complex at the AAUAAA polyadenylation initiation signal during full-length poly(A) tail addition (18Bienroth S.

Wahle E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1678: 67-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The situation regarding RNA uridylyltransferases is unclear (22Aphasizhev R. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 2194-2203Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Here, we identify steps in the movement of vaccinia VP55 across its primer and onto the nascent tail during tail addition. Materials—VP55 and VP55-ΔN10 were purified as described (16Moure C.M. Bowman B.R. Gershon P.D. Quiocho F.A. Mol. Cell. 2006; 33: 339-349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Purified proteins had estimated specific activities for polyadenylation of >90%. Oligonucleotides were synthesized via solid phase chemistries using reagents from Glen Research Corp. and Chemgenes Corp. Prior to use, oligonucleotides were purified by urea-PAGE using standard methods. Steady-state Fluorescence Spectrophotometry and SFFS—80-μl samples of VP55 and oligonucleotide (4 and 2 μm, respectively) in TD buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 2 mm dithiothreitol) were equilibrated at room temperature for 15-30 min. Steady-state fluorescence spectra were then collected at room temperature, using a Hitachi model F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer with a sample path length, photomultiplier tube voltage, and scan speed of 3 mm, 700 V, and 240 nm/min, respectively. Excitation spectra were collected at a fixed emission wavelength of 370 nm, and emission spectra were collected at a fixed excitation wavelength of 320 nm, with excitation and emission bandwidths of 5 and 10 nm, respectively. Excitation and emission scan ranges were 250-350 and 330-550 nm, respectively. Bar plots are derived from the fluorescence signal at the 365-370 nm maximum of the scanned peak.

After equilibration to room temperature, reactions were initiated, either manually by manual rapid mixing or by firing 15-μl aliquots of the respective reagent mixtures simultaneously from syringes 1 and 2 of a four-syringe microvolume quench-flow instrument (QFM-400, BioLogic SA, Grenoble, France, fitted with a 3-μl delay line). Reactions were quenched with 50 mm EDTA (pH 8.0) in formamide either manually or with a 30-μl shot from syringe 4 of the QFM-400 with products collected into 1.5 mlmicrotubes. 4-μl aliquots of quenched reactions were resolved in 15% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gels in standard Tris borate/EDTA buffer. cy3 fluorescence was acquired from wet gels in the cy3 channel of a Molecular Imager FX Pro Plus (Bio-Rad; 532 nm excitation). The 33-nt oligonucleotide primers used throughout this study contained the VP55-binding motif (8Deng L. Gershon P.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1103-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), VP55's translocatory motif (10Johnson L. Liu S. Gershon P.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 843-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and, in most instances, a 5′-cy3 moiety. In all primers, 2-aminopurine deoxyribonucleotide (2-AP, a fluorescent nucleotide) was present at a single non-essential position. VP55-dependent Enhancement of Oligonucleotide (2-AP) Fluorescence—Our standard downstream 2-AP primer (possessing 2-AP adjacent to the -10(U) of the VP55-binding motif, Fig. 1A) showed a broad fluorescence excitation peak attributable to rU, dC (23Cavaluzzi M.J. Borer P.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: e13Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), and 2-AP (Fig. 1B). Upon the addition of excess VP55 to the primer followed by rescanning, excitation spectra showed an ∼3-fold increase in fluorescence intensity in the 310-320-nm region (Fig. 1B). Fluorescence emission spectra for the primer showed an emission peak centered at 365 nm, which was enhanced 2.9-fold upon the addition of VP55 and rescanning (Fig. 1C). Discontinuous VP55 Translocation—Our standard upstream 2-AP primer (possessing 2-AP at position -25, Fig. 2A) exhibited fluorescence excitation and emission spectra almost identical to those of Fig. 1, B and C (data not shown). The magnitude of VP55-induced fluorescence emission enhancement for the standard upstream and downstream 2-AP primers was virtually identical (∼2.9-3-fold; Fig. 2B). The observation of enhanced fluorescence afforded an opportunity to assay isomerization of the VP55-primer complex in real time during poly(A) tail addition, via SFFS. Each of the two standard primers exhibited a distinctive SFFS fluorescence intensity versus time profile during the initial 10 s of poly(A) tail addition (Fig. 2C), indicating that VP55 interacts asynchronously with regions of the primer immediately adjacent to -27/-26(UU) and -10(U) portions of the VP55-binding motif. The initial notable event on the time trajectory (starting at ∼0.25 s, in Fig. 2C, labeled a) was a loss of fluorescence enhancement for the downstream 2-AP primer, indicating loss of a downstream primer-VP55 contact. The subsequent notable event (first noticeable at ∼1.0 s, in Fig. 2C, labeled b1) was a loss of fluorescence enhancement with the upstream 2-AP primer consistent with loss of the upstream contact. This was accompanied by a transient re-emergence of fluorescence enhancement for the downstream 2-AP primer (b2), consistent with a rebinding of VP55's -27/-26(UU)-binding site in the -10(U) region. Finally (starting at ∼1.5 s, in Fig. 2C, labeled c), there was a loss of this transient fluorescence enhancement, consistent with a movement of VP55's -27/-26(UU)-binding site from the 2-AP at position -9 to a position further downstream. The absence of synchronized isomerization at the two 2-AP sites (Fig. 2) was consistent with molecular flexibility in either the polymerase or the primer or both during the initial stages of translocation by VP55, and therefore, saltatory translocation. To establish whether the fluorescence changes observed by SFFS were truly dependent upon primer elongation, control oligonucleotides were synthesized identical to the two standard primers, except for replacement of the 3′-most riboU with dideoxyT. Since the 3′-OH ordinarily serves as the initial attacking nucleophile in the polymerization reaction, the absence of this moiety prevented polymerization but did not affect primer-polymerase affinity determinants. SFFS experiments (Fig. 3, A and B, performed under conditions identical to those of Fig. 2C) showed no significant fluorescence changes for the control primers, indicating that the fluorescence changes of Fig. 2C were dependent upon actual primer elongation as opposed to, for example, Mg·ATP-protein interaction. Continuous Tail Elongation Accompanies PolymerasePrimer Isomerizations—Poly(A) tail lengths were assayed at specific points in the SFFS time line (Fig. 4). Time points prior to the first SFFS isomerization in Fig. 2C (50-200 ms) showed tails mostly 5 nt or shorter, the range of tail lengths that can be synthesized with the polymerase bound to just the VP55-binding motif (9Deng L. Beigelman L. Matulic-Adamic J. Karpeisky A. Gershon P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31542-31552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). 1-12-nt-tailed products accumulated during the 200-1000-ms interval (Fig. 4), corresponding to SFFS phase a (Fig. 2C). Between 1000 and 1500 ms (corresponding to Fig. 2C, phase b1/b2,), 1-16-nt products appeared. Between 1.5 and 5 s (corresponding to Fig. 2C, phase c), 7-26-nt products (full-length tails) began to appear. The processive round was considered complete by ∼5 s in the assay of Fig. 4, consistent with both VP55's known inability to processively elongate tails beyond ∼26-35 nt and the cessation of the phase c fluorescence drop in Fig. 2C. However, in vitro, some elongation typically continues in a much slower, non-processive mode (7Gershon P.D. Moss B. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1575-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) as visible in the 5-60-s time points of Fig. 4 (this non-processive mode was relatively rapid under the conditions of polymerase excess employed here). The resistance of some 17-20 adenylate-tailed products to non-processive elongation (Fig. 4) may have been due to primer “masking” under the conditions of polymerase excess. In conclusion, the polymerase catalytic center appears to progress more or less uniformly notwithstanding isomerization of polymerase-primer contacts further upstream. 2-AP Adjacent to the Translocatory Motif Detects Additional, Distinct Polymerase Contacts—To determine whether alternative sites of 2-AP within the primer could detect distinct profiles, three additional primers were synthesized containing 2-AP at positions -20, -15, or -6 (Fig. 5A). Steady-state fluorescence emission measurements in the absence and presence of VP55 (Fig. 5B) indicated a diminished fluorescence enhancement for the 2-AP positions not adjacent to essential uridylates (-20, -15). This did not arise from a lowered affinity (data not shown) and was therefore attributed to diminished fluorescence coupling. SFFS polyadenylation profiles are shown in Fig. 5C. With respect to the profile for the standard downstream 2-AP primer, repositioning of 2-AP six nucleotides further upstream (to position -15) did not lead to a new fluorescence profile, but instead, to a less pronounced version of that for the standard downstream 2-AP primer. The absence of a new profile indicated that contact at position -15 is not within an independently mobile domain of VP55 but is within the same one that interacts at -9/-10. The less pronounced signal (consistent with the weaker fluorescence enhancement in Fig. 5B) indicated that either polymerase contact with 2-AP at -15 is less prone to fluorescence enhancement or 2-AP located at -15 detected only a minor population with respect to a thermodynamically more favorable one in which VP55's fluorescence-enhancing site contacts position -9. Repositioning 2-AP an additional 5 nt further upstream (to position -20) also did not lead to a new profile, but instead, to an apparent hybrid of the standard downstream and upstream profiles (2-AP at position -9 and -25, respectively). Thus, the -20 position either overlaps the upstream-binding and downstream-binding domains of VP55 or is distributed between complexes in which it is bound to either one. Again, the less pronounced trace was consistent with the less pronounced fluorescence enhancement in Fig. 5B. The final primer, in which 2-AP was positioned closer to the 3′ end (position -6), showed a novel profile with an early, sustained, rise in fluorescence enhancement. The three distinct fluorescence profiles observed thus far (Figs. 2 and 5) are interpreted in terms of VP55 translocatory steps (Fig. 6). During the first ∼0.25 s (prior), the first few adenylates are added to the tail prior to any isomerization of uridulate-VP55 contacts. During phase a, VP55's downstream uridylate-binding site dissociates from -10(U) (loss of enhancement, blue trace) and rebinds around -7U (gain in enhancement, pink trace). During phase b, VP55's upstream uridylate-binding site dissociates from -27/-26(UU) (loss of enhancement, red trace) and rebinds -10(U) gain in enhancement, blue trace). In Fig. 6B, this is quickly followed by a downstream movement in the downstream U-binding site to restore spacing between VP55's two U-binding sites. Although the pink trace (Fig. 6A) appears to show a broad peak in fluorescence enhancement, this is interpreted as two overlapping peaks (elongation becoming less synchronous later in the tail addition cycle), the first of which is dropping at the end of phase b, consistent with the restoration of spacing mentioned above. During phase c, VP55's upstream uridylate-binding site dissociates from -10(U) (second loss of enhancement, blue trace) and binds -7(U) (pink trace, second broad peak). Phase d represents the disengagement of VP55 from all three uridylate sensors. During the above process, it is proposed that the catalytic center tracks the 3′ end monotonically, consistent with the apparently uniform (pause-free) tail elongation apparent in Fig. 4. Although Fig. 6B shows VP55 only undergoing isomerization as translocation progresses, this is for ease of depiction and does not rule out changes in the topology of the primer. Defined Intermediates of Processive Tail Elongation—Primers with short preformed oligo(A) tails (mimicking polyadenylation intermediates, Fig. 7A) were synthesized containing 2-AP adjacent to the downstream U of the VP55-binding motif (a position at which SFFS data showed the greatest information content, Fig. 2C). Steady-state fluorescence emission measurements indicated a magnitude of fluorescence enhancement that was inversely related to the length of preformed tail (Fig. 7B). This was consistent with a fluorescence-enhancing region of VP55 falling in register with the RNA 3′-OH, leading to its progressive movement away from the 2-AP sensor with increasing tail length. SFFS experiments (Fig. 7C) reinforced and extended these conclusions. When compared with the downstream 2-AP primer lacking a preformed tail (Fig. 6A; in which phases a, b2, and c initiated at ∼0.2, 0.8, and 1.5 s, respectively), the primer with a preformed AA tail initiated the three phases earlier in the time line (at ∼0.02, 0.5 and 1.0 s, respectively). With preformed tails of 4, 6 or 8 adenylates, phase a (the initial drop in fluorescence) was no longer detected (Fig. 7C; consistent with the lower fluorescence enhancement upon initial binding Fig. 7B). This was presumably because, with the longer preformed tail, the downstream domain had already moved away from its starting position over 2-AP. Consistent with the 4-, 6-, and 8-nt tail primers representing intermediates in VP55's processive polyadenylation cycle, phase b2 (the rebinding event) occurred progressively earlier with increasing preformed tail length (initiating at 0.3, 0.2, and 0.1 s, respectively). We conclude that primers possessing preformed oligo(A) tails mimic bona fide translocation intermediates and that VP55's downstream U-binding site advances progressively during the early stages of tail elongation. Discontinuous Translocation Is Obligatory—The primers used for the experiments of Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 possessed no uridylates other than those essential for VP55 binding and synthesis of a full-length, 25-30-nt poly(A) tail (see the Introduction). Other sequence positions were filled with dC. To address the possibility that we may have forced a discontinuous mode of translocation upon VP55 by use of primers with significant non-ribouridylate tracts, primers were synthesized with 2-AP at positions equivalent to those of Fig. 2 but embedded within uniform oligo(U) tracts (Fig. 8A). In SFFS experiments (Fig. 8B), time-dependent fluorescence changes were not coordinated between the upstream and downstream 2-AP positions, indicating that, even when given an opportunity to “slide” monotonically over an isoenergetic oligo(U) tract, VP55's preferred mode of translocation was discontinuous with regard to the most major isomerization events. Fluorescence profiles in Fig. 8B differed in subtler ways from those of the standard primers (Fig. 2C); for example, phase a started immediately upon initiating polyadenylation (without a 0.2-s pause), phase b was more prolonged (0.3-3 s), and phase c started later (3 s) and was not complete by the end of the assay (10 s). To better understand these differences, tail length data were acquired for one of the oligo(U)-based primers (Fig. 8C). Tails were first visible at 10 ms (as opposed to 100 ms with the standard downstream primer, Fig. 4), with the oligo(U) primer receiving up to 14 adenylates by 100 ms. Apparently, the presence of the uniform oligo(U) tract between position -10 and the 3′-OH eliminated any initial pause in the forward movement of the downstream U-binding domain. In phase b, tails were elongated to 28 nt. Tails continued to be elongated processively between ∼3 and 30 s (Fig. 8C), consistent with the markedly slower and more prolonged phase c (Fig. 8B). There may be a greater number of rebinding options for VP55's -27/-26(UU)-binding site during phase c with oligo(U) primers, with some complexes imperfectly orientated for rapid completion of processive tail addition or for exposure of the 3′-OH for the subsequent non-processive phase. Here, translocation of the vaccinia poly(A) polymerase, VP55, was monitored as a function of time during processive addition of the complete ∼25-30-nt poly(A) tail via continuous, real-time changes in 2-AP fluorescence enhancement arising from isomerization of the VP55-primer complex. Since VP55 does not interact with 2-AP in a way that promotes protein-RNA interaction (VP55 recognizes uridylates only, and all essential uridylates were already present within primers), 2-AP apparently acts independently of RNA recognition. However, it provided the strongest and most unique signals only when adjacent to essential uridylates of the primer. Fluorescence enhancement may have arisen from a localized destacking of weakly or partially stacked bases within the single-stranded oligonucleotide upon polymerase binding, perhaps due to engagement of the polymerase with the uridylate adjacent to the 2-AP. Alternatively, there may be some form of direct electronic coupling of the 2-AP nucleobase with aromatic side chains of VP55 present in the vicinity of the uridylate recognition sites. The primers used in the first part of this study were RNA·DNA chimeras. The use of such chimeras with VP55 is entirely consistent with prior studies. Thus, although RNA primers were shown long ago to be inactive when resynthesized as all-DNA, when the DNA's dT residues were substituted with rU, full primer activity was restored (11Gershon P.D. Moss B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4705-4714Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This finding has subsequently been sustained, exploited, and extended (8Deng L. Gershon P.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1103-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 9Deng L. Beigelman L. Matulic-Adamic J. Karpeisky A. Gershon P.D. J. Biol.

Biol. 2002; 9: 679-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The current study exploits the above finding without inconsistency or conflict. Albeit that the SFFS experiments were monitoring the major population of primer molecules at any one time, the lack of abruptness in fluorescence changes was consistent with the distribution of tail lengths observed in RQF experiments at each time point (Fig. 4). Use of a much stronger quench in quench-flow experiments (alkaline SDS, data not shown) did not narrow the product distribution, arguing against non-instantaneous quenching. Due to the processivity of VP55, premature termination by the polymerase during the assay was also presumably not responsible for asynchrony. However, asynchrony could have arisen from non-uniform initiation times or elongation rates. The data presented here and interpreted in Fig. 6 extend a prior study that provided static “snapshots” of VP55's primer contacts during the addition of the first ∼10 adenylates of the tail, via partial hydrolysis of primer molecules possessing preformed oligo(A) tails and essential uridylate positions as mixed rU/dC pools after substrate selection by VP55 (10Johnson L. Liu S. Gershon P.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 843-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). As in the current study, a three-module polymerase was required to account for the data. Isomerizations during phases a and b of the current study are in complete agreement with the prior study. Although the prior study was able to correlate changes in contact more precisely with changes in tail length, contacts could not be monitored clearly for primers with tails >∼10 nt in length. The current experiments provide a more complete picture of changes in polymerase-primer contact, continuously, and in real time during poly(A) tail elongation. Moreover, the experiments in Fig. 7 of the current study showed that primers with preformed tails mimic bona fide translocation intermediates, validating the selection approach taken previously (10Johnson L. Liu S. Gershon P.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 843-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The two complementary approaches are strikingly consistent, and the model of Fig. 6 provides an overall picture, demonstrating later steps that could only be speculated in the prior study (10Johnson L. Liu S. Gershon P.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 843-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Overall, the data demonstrate a saltatory translocation mechanism for VP55, the first such demonstration for a non-templated nucleic acid polymerase. We thank Sufeng Zhou for help in expression and purification of VP55, Dr. Tom Poulos for use of the fluorescence spectrophotometer and stopped-flow spectrometer and members of the Poulos laboratory for assistance, Dr. Steen Pedersen (Baylor College of Medicine) for the use of a stopped-flow spectrometer and help with preliminary experiments."
