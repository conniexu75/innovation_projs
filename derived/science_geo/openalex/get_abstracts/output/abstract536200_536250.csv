https://openalex.org/W1931219748,"Acceleration and collision of particles has been a key strategy for exploring the texture of matter. Strong light waves can control and recollide electronic wavepackets, generating high-harmonic radiation that encodes the structure and dynamics of atoms and molecules and lays the foundations of attosecond science. The recent discovery of high-harmonic generation in bulk solids combines the idea of ultrafast acceleration with complex condensed matter systems, and provides hope for compact solid-state attosecond sources and electronics at optical frequencies. Yet the underlying quantum motion has not so far been observable in real time. Here we study high-harmonic generation in a bulk solid directly in the time domain, and reveal a new kind of strong-field excitation in the crystal. Unlike established atomic sources, our solid emits high-harmonic radiation as a sequence of subcycle bursts that coincide temporally with the field crests of one polarity of the driving terahertz waveform. We show that these features are characteristic of a non-perturbative quantum interference process that involves electrons from multiple valence bands. These results identify key mechanisms for future solid-state attosecond sources and next-generation light-wave electronics. The new quantum interference process justifies the hope for all-optical band-structure reconstruction and lays the foundation for possible quantum logic operations at optical clock rates."
https://openalex.org/W1766184155,"Mitochondria are shown to form a conductive pathway throughout the cell in the form of a proton motive force, and throughout this network, mitochondrial protein localization seems to be varied, allowing optimized generation and utilization of the mitochondrial membrane potential; the rapid energy distribution network, which depends on conduction rather than diffusion, could explain how the muscle can rapidly respond to energy demands. How is energy distributed within the cell? In the skeletal muscle, energy distribution has been proposed to occur through metabolite-facilitated diffusion, although genetic evidence has raised questions about the importance of this mode of distribution. Using various forms of high-resolution microscopy, Robert Balaban and colleagues explore whether the mitochondria themselves — as well as actually generating the energy — also have a role in its distribution. They find that they do, by forming a conductive pathway throughout the cell in the form of a proton-motive force. Throughout this network, the mitochondrial protein localization seems to be varied, allowing optimized generation and utilization of the mitochondrial membrane potential. This energy distribution network, which depends on conduction rather than diffusion, is potentially extremely rapid, thereby enabling muscle to respond almost instantaneously to new energy demands. Intracellular energy distribution has attracted much interest and has been proposed to occur in skeletal muscle via metabolite-facilitated diffusion1,2; however, genetic evidence suggests that facilitated diffusion is not critical for normal function3,4,5,6,7. We hypothesized that mitochondrial structure minimizes metabolite diffusion distances in skeletal muscle. Here we demonstrate a mitochondrial reticulum providing a conductive pathway for energy distribution, in the form of the proton-motive force, throughout the mouse skeletal muscle cell. Within this reticulum, we find proteins associated with mitochondrial proton-motive force production preferentially in the cell periphery and proteins that use the proton-motive force for ATP production in the cell interior near contractile and transport ATPases. Furthermore, we show a rapid, coordinated depolarization of the membrane potential component of the proton-motive force throughout the cell in response to spatially controlled uncoupling of the cell interior. We propose that membrane potential conduction via the mitochondrial reticulum is the dominant pathway for skeletal muscle energy distribution."
https://openalex.org/W2170132508,"Aurorae are detected from all the magnetized planets in our Solar System, including Earth. They are powered by magnetospheric current systems that lead to the precipitation of energetic electrons into the high-latitude regions of the upper atmosphere. In the case of the gas-giant planets, these aurorae include highly polarized radio emission at kilohertz and megahertz frequencies produced by the precipitating electrons, as well as continuum and line emission in the infrared, optical, ultraviolet and X-ray parts of the spectrum, associated with the collisional excitation and heating of the hydrogen-dominated atmosphere. Here we report simultaneous radio and optical spectroscopic observations of an object at the end of the stellar main sequence, located right at the boundary between stars and brown dwarfs, from which we have detected radio and optical auroral emissions both powered by magnetospheric currents. Whereas the magnetic activity of stars like our Sun is powered by processes that occur in their lower atmospheres, these aurorae are powered by processes originating much further out in the magnetosphere of the dwarf star that couple energy into the lower atmosphere. The dissipated power is at least four orders of magnitude larger than what is produced in the Jovian magnetosphere, revealing aurorae to be a potentially ubiquitous signature of large-scale magnetospheres that can scale to luminosities far greater than those observed in our Solar System. These magnetospheric current systems may also play a part in powering some of the weather phenomena reported on brown dwarfs."
https://openalex.org/W1859873146,"During aging, changes occur in the collagen network that contribute to various pathological phenotypes in the skeletal, vascular, and pulmonary systems. The aim of this study was to investigate the consequences of age-related modifications on the mechanical stability and in vitro proteolytic degradation of type I collagen. Analyzing mouse tail and bovine bone collagen, we found that collagen at both fibril and fiber levels varies in rigidity and Young's modulus due to different physiological changes, which correlate with changes in cathepsin K (CatK)-mediated degradation. A decreased susceptibility to CatK-mediated hydrolysis of fibrillar collagen was observed following mineralization and advanced glycation end product-associated modification. However, aging of bone increased CatK-mediated osteoclastic resorption by ∼27%, and negligible resorption was observed when osteoclasts were cultured on mineral-deficient bone. We observed significant differences in the excavations generated by osteoclasts and C-terminal telopeptide release during bone resorption under distinct conditions. Our data indicate that modification of collagen compromises its biomechanical integrity and affects CatK-mediated degradation both in bone and tissue, thus contributing to our understanding of extracellular matrix aging."
https://openalex.org/W1896472383,"Huntington disease (HD) represents a family of neurodegenerative diseases that are caused by misfolded proteins. The misfolded proteins accumulate in the affected brain regions in an age-dependent manner to cause late-onset neurodegeneration. Transgenic mouse models expressing the HD protein, huntingtin, have been widely used to identify therapeutics that may retard disease progression. Here we report that Berberine (BBR), an organic small molecule isolated from plants, has protective effects on transgenic HD (N171-82Q) mice. We found that BBR can reduce the accumulation of mutant huntingtin in cultured cells. More importantly, when given orally, BBR could effectively alleviate motor dysfunction and prolong the survival of transgenic N171-82Q HD mice. We found that BBR could promote the degradation of mutant huntingtin by enhancing autophagic function. Since BBR is an orally-taken drug that has been safely used to treat a number of diseases, our findings suggest that BBR can be tested on different HD animal models and HD patients to further evaluate its therapeutic effects."
https://openalex.org/W1930603020,"Background To date there is no established consensus of assessment criteria for evaluating research ethics review. Methods We conducted a scoping review of empirical research assessing ethics review processes in order to identify common elements assessed, research foci, and research gaps to aid in the development of assessment criteria. Electronic searches of Ovid Medline, PsychInfo, and the Cochrane DSR, ACP Journal Club, DARE, CCTR, CMR, HTA, and NHSEED, were conducted. After de-duplication, 4234 titles and abstracts were reviewed. Altogether 4036 articles were excluded following screening of titles, abstracts and full text. A total of 198 articles included for final data extraction. Results Few studies originated from outside North America and Europe. No study reported using an underlying theory or framework of quality/effectiveness to guide study design or analyses. We did not identify any studies that had involved a controlled trial - randomised or otherwise – of ethics review procedures or processes. Studies varied substantially with respect to outcomes assessed, although tended to focus on structure and timeliness of ethics review. Discussion Our findings indicate a lack of consensus on appropriate assessment criteria, exemplified by the varied study outcomes identified, but also a fragmented body of research. To date research has been largely quantitative, with little attention given to stakeholder experiences, and is largely cross sectional. A lack of longitudinal research to date precludes analyses of change or assessment of quality improvement in ethics review."

https://openalex.org/W1680220675,"The pluripotency and self-renewal capacity of embryonic stem (ES) cells is regulated by several transcription factors. Here, we show that the ETS-related transcription factors Etv4 and Etv5 (Etv4/5) are specifically expressed in undifferentiated ES cells, and suppression of Oct3/4 results in down-regulation of Etv4/5. Simultaneous deletion of Etv4 and Etv5 (Etv4/5 double knock-out (dKO)) in ES cells resulted in a flat, epithelial cell-like appearance, whereas the morphology changed into compact colonies in a 2i medium (containing two inhibitors for GSK3 and MEK/ERK). Expression levels of self-renewal marker genes, including Oct3/4 and Nanog, were similar between wild-type and dKO ES cells, whereas proliferation of Etv4/5 dKO ES cells was decreased with overexpression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (p16/p19, p15, and p57). A differentiation assay revealed that the embryoid bodies derived from Etv4/5 dKO ES cells were smaller than the control, and expression of ectoderm marker genes, including Fgf5, Sox1, and Pax3, was not induced in dKO-derived embryoid bodies. Microarray analysis demonstrated that stem cell-related genes, including Tcf15, Gbx2, Lrh1, Zic3, and Baf60c, were significantly repressed in Etv4/5 dKO ES cells. The artificial expression of Etv4 and/or Etv5 in Etv4/5 dKO ES cells induced re-expression of Tcf15 and Gbx2. These results indicate that Etv4 and Etv5, potentially through regulation of Gbx2 and Tcf15, are involved in the ES cell proliferation and induction of differentiation-associated genes in ES cells.

The ETS transcription factors of the PEA3 group, including ETV1 (also called ER81), ETV4 (also called PEA3), and ETV5 (also called ERM), are involved in critical physiological processes, such as early development, organogenesis, and morphogenesis (40de Launoit Y.

A single knockout of either Etv4 or Etv5 is not sufficient to cause kidney defects, but Etv4/5 double knock-out mice do not develop kidneys, suggesting that ETV4 and ETV5 are functionally redundant (41Lu B.C.

In the present study, we discovered that the expression of Etv4 and Etv5 is regulated by OCT3/4, and investigations of Etv4 and Etv5 double knock-out ES cells clarified that these two molecules are involved in the proliferation and differentiation of ES cells. ES cell lines PE9 (control wild-type ES cells), PE15-2 (Etv4 and Etv5 double knock-out (Etv4/5 dKO) ES cells), and ZHBTc4 (conditional Oct3/4-knock-out ES cells) are derived from previous investigations (8Niwa H.

For the LIF depletion culture, PE9 and PE15-2 ES cells were cultured for 3 days in the absence of LIF in gelatin-coated dishes. To control Oct3/4 expression, ZHBTc4 ES cells were cultured with or without 1 μg/ml tetracycline (Tet) (Sigma-Aldrich) for 24 to 48 h. To restore Oct3/4 expression, the culture medium of Tet-treated cells was changed to a Tet-free medium, and the cells were cultured for another 24 h. For the embryoid body (EB) formation assay, ES cells were cultured by a hanging drop method (1 × 104 cells/20 μl). After 3 days, the EBs were transferred to ultra-low attachment tissue culture plates (Corning, Inc.) and then cultured for 6–9 days in the absence of LIF.

Miyazaki J. Efficient selection for high-expression transfectants with a novel eukaryotic vector.Gene. 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4584) Google Scholar). A hygromycin-resistant pCAG vector was constructed by inserting the puromycin resistance gene of pCAGIP-Myc into the hygromycin resistance gene. The plasmid was named pCAGIH-Myc. Coding regions of Etv4 and Etv5 were amplified by PCR using specific primers listed in supplemental Table S1. pCAGIP-Myc-Etv4, pCAGIP-Myc-Etv5, pCAGIP-FLAG-Etv5, and pCAGIH-Myc-Etv4 were constructed by inserting corresponding coding sequences into the expression vectors. For reporter plasmid construction, the promoter region (from −2019 to −2486; the transcription start site is considered as +1) of the Etv4 gene and the intron 6 region of the Etv5 gene were amplified by PCR using specific primers listed in supplemental Table S1. To introduce mutation of an OCT3/4-binding sequence of these regions, mutated OCT3/4 binding sequences were constructed by PCR using specific primers. PCR products were cloned into pGL4-promoter (48Ura H. Usuda M. Kinoshita K. Sun C. Mori K. Akagi T. Matsuda T. Koide H. Yokota T.

Plasmids were introduced into cultured cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. ETV4- or ETV5-expressing ES cells were established by introduction of pCAGIP-Myc-Etv4 or -Etv5 into Etv4/5 dKO (PE15-2) ES cells and cultured in the presence of 0.5 μg/ml puromycin (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan). ETV4/5-expressing PE15-2 ES cells were established as follows. First, ETV4-expressing PE15-2 ES cells were established by introducing pCAGIH-Myc-Etv4 into PE15-2 ES cells. They were subsequently cultured in the presence of 300 μg/ml hygromycin (Nacalai Tesque). After that, pCAGIP-FLAG-Etv5 was introduced into the cells. Cells were selected by puromycin, and the cell line was named PE15-2 (ETV4/ETV5) 8. A control cell line was established by introduction of empty vectors (both pCAGIH-Myc and pCAGIP-FLAG) into PE15-2 ES cells in parallel. The cell line was named PE15-2 (ev/ev) 1. Oligonucleotides containing an OCT3/4-binding site of the Etv4 gene and ETV4/5-binding site of the Gbx2 gene were synthesized. The oligonucleotide sequences are shown in supplemental Table S1. For a biotin-labeled DNA pull-down assay, 5 μm 3′-biotinylated double-stranded oligonucleotide was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 1 mg of either Myc-Oct3/4-, Myc-Etv4-, or Myc-Etv5-transfected HEK293 cell extracts in the presence of streptavidin-agarose (EMD Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany). For the competition assays, non-labeled oligonucleotide, either wild-type or mutant, was added in 25-fold molar excess. The beads were washed three times with a washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm MgCl2, and 150 mm NaCl). Samples were examined by Western blot analysis. For immunostaining analysis, ES cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 30 min. After permeabilization with 0.5% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the cells were preincubated with 1% BSA in PBS. The cells were then incubated with antibodies against NANOG (SC1000, Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany), OCT3/4 (sc-9081, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), or ESRRB (PP-H6705-00, Perseus Proteomics, Tokyo, Japan) at 4 °C overnight, followed by incubation with 100-fold diluted goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG FITC (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For Western blot analysis, samples were mixed with an SDS sample buffer (5× buffer: 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 30% glycerol, 10% SDS, 250 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm EDTA, and 0.01% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250), subjected to SDS-10% PAGE, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was incubated with antibodies for NANOG, OCT3/4, ESRRB, α-tubulin (M175-3, MBL, Nagoya, Japan), or c-Myc (sc-40; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), followed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (EMD Millipore). The blot was visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with an LAS-1000 image analyzer (Fuji Film). Activity of alkaline phosphatase was determined using either a quantitative alkaline phosphatase ES characterization kit (Merck Millipore) or a vector blue substrate kit (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocols. For the reporter assay, ZHBTc4 ES cells were transfected with pGL4 reporter plasmids, and these cells were divided into two dishes 24 h after transfection and cultured with or without 1 μg/ml Tet for 24 h. Cells were lysed in the cell lysis buffer, and luciferase activity in the extracts was measured using a luciferase assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) with an AB-2200 (ATTO, Tokyo, Japan). Nuclear extracts were isolated as described before (16Uranishi K. Akagi T. Sun C. Koide H. Yokota T. Dax1 associates with Esrrb and regulates its function in embryonic stem cells.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2013; 33: 2056-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, ZHBTc4 ES cells treated with or without 1 μg/ml Tet for 3 days were resuspended in a buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 20% glycerol, 10 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Samples were incubated on ice for 15 min and spun down at 1,000 rpm for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in the same buffer at 2.5 × 107 nuclei/ml, and then 62.5 μl of 5 m NaCl was added to the 1 ml of sample. After incubation at 4 °C for 30 min, the sample was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm, and the supernatant was used as a nuclear extract. Oligonucleotides containing the OCT3/4-binding site of the Etv5 gene were synthesized. The oligonucleotide sequences are shown in supplemental Table S1. Double-stranded probes were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA) and purified by Mini Quick Spin Oligo columns (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). For a binding reaction, 5 μg of nuclear extracts were incubated with a radiolabeled probe, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 300 μg/ml BSA either with or without a 200-fold excess of cold probe, either wild-type or mutated oligonucleotides, as a competitor. Also, either 2–4 μg of anti-OCT3/4 antibody (sc-5279; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or an anti-FLAG antibody (F3165; Sigma-Aldrich) were added to the reaction mixture for a su"
https://openalex.org/W2115495815,"The Cas9 endonuclease is used for genome editing applications in diverse eukaryotic species. A high frequency of off-target activity has been reported in many cell types, limiting its applications to genome engineering, especially in genomic medicine. Here, we generated a synthetic chimeric protein between the catalytic domain of the FokI endonuclease and the catalytically inactive Cas9 protein (fdCas9). A pair of guide RNAs (gRNAs) that bind to sense and antisense strands with a defined spacer sequence range can be used to form a catalytically active dimeric fdCas9 protein and generate double-strand breaks (DSBs) within the spacer sequence. Our data demonstrate an improved catalytic activity of the fdCas9 endonuclease, with a spacer range of 15–39 nucleotides, on surrogate reporters and genomic targets. Furthermore, we observed no detectable fdCas9 activity at known Cas9 off-target sites. Taken together, our data suggest that the fdCas9 endonuclease variant is a superior platform for genome editing applications in eukaryotic systems including mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W1602580383,"A long standing question in synaptic physiology is how neurotransmitter-filled vesicles are rebuilt after exocytosis. Among the first steps in this process is the endocytic retrieval of the transmembrane proteins that are enriched in synaptic vesicles (SVs). At least six types of transmembrane proteins must be recovered, but the rules for how this multiple cargo selection is accomplished are poorly understood. Among these SV cargos is the vesicular glutamate transporter (vGlut). We show here that vGlut1 has a strong influence on the kinetics of retrieval of half of the known SV cargos and that specifically impairing the endocytosis of vGlut1 in turn slows down other SV cargos, demonstrating that cargo retrieval is a collective cargo-driven process. Finally, we demonstrate that different cargos can be retrieved in the same synapse with different kinetics, suggesting that additional post-endocytic sorting steps likely occur in the nerve terminal."
https://openalex.org/W1840855560,"We present an example-based multi-atlas approach for classifying white matter (WM) tracts into anatomic bundles. Our approach exploits expert-provided example data to automatically classify the WM tracts of a subject. Multiple atlases are constructed to model the example data from multiple subjects in order to reflect the individual variability of bundle shapes and trajectories over subjects. For each example subject, an atlas is maintained to allow the example data of a subject to be added or deleted flexibly. A voting scheme is proposed to facilitate the multi-atlas exploitation of example data. For conceptual simplicity, we adopt the same metrics in both example data construction and WM tract labeling. Due to the huge number of WM tracts in a subject, it is time-consuming to label each WM tract individually. Thus, the WM tracts are grouped according to their shape similarity, and WM tracts within each group are labeled simultaneously. To further enhance the computational efficiency, we implemented our approach on the graphics processing unit (GPU). Through nested cross-validation we demonstrated that our approach yielded high classification performance. The average sensitivities for bundles in the left and right hemispheres were 89.5% and 91.0%, respectively, and their average false discovery rates were 14.9% and 14.2%, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1620875426,"Cutaneous melanoma is an aggressive malignancy; its incidence is increasing worldwide and its prognosis remains poor. Clinical observations indicate that estrogen receptor β (ERβ) is expressed in melanoma tissues and its expression decreases with tumor progression, suggesting its tumor suppressive function. These experiments were performed to investigate the effects of ERβ activation on melanoma cell growth.Protein expression was analyzed by Western blot and immunofluorescence assays. Cell proliferation was assessed by counting the cells by hemocytometer. ERβ transcriptional activity was evaluated by gene reporter assay. Global DNA methylation was analyzed by restriction enzyme assay and ERβ isoforms were identified by qRT-PCR. We demonstrated that ERβ is expressed in a panel of human melanoma cell lines (BLM, WM115, A375, WM1552). In BLM (NRAS-mutant) cells, ERβ agonists significantly and specifically inhibited cell proliferation. ERβ activation triggered its cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity. Moreover, the antiproliferative activity of ERβ agonists was associated with an altered expression of G1-S transition-related proteins. In these cells, global DNA was found to be hypomethylated when compared to normal melanocytes; this DNA hypomethylation status was reverted by ERβ activation. ERβ agonists also decreased the proliferation of WM115 (BRAF V600D-mutant) cells, while they failed to reduce the growth of A375 and WM1552 (BRAF V600E-mutant) cells. Finally, we could observe that ERβ isoforms are expressed at different levels in the various cell lines. Specific oncogenic mutations or differential expression of receptor isoforms might be responsible for the different responses of cell lines to ERβ agonists.Our results demonstrate that ERβ is expressed in melanoma cell lines and that ERβ agonists differentially regulate the proliferation of these cells. These data confirm the notion that melanoma is a heterogeneous tumor and that genetic profiling is mandatory for the development of effective personalized therapeutic approaches for melanoma patients."
https://openalex.org/W1925280967,"Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Emerging studies suggest that epigenetic mechanisms contribute to the development and progression of fibrosis in CKD. HHcy and its intermediates are known to alter the DNA methylation pattern, which is a critical regulator of epigenetic information. In this study, we hypothesized that HHcy causes renovascular remodeling by DNA hypermethylation, leading to glomerulosclerosis. We also evaluated whether the DNA methylation inhibitor, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza) could modulate extracellular matrix (ECM) metabolism and reduce renovascular fibrosis. C57BL/6J (wild-type) and cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS(+/-)) mice, treated without or with 5-Aza (0.5 mg/kg body weight, i.p.), were used. CBS(+/-) mice showed high plasma Hcy levels, hypertension, and significant glomerular and arteriolar injury. 5-Aza treatment normalized blood pressure and reversed renal injury. CBS(+/-) mice showed global hypermethylation and up-regulation of DNA methyltransferase-1 and -3a. Methylation-specific PCR showed an imbalance between matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 and -2 and also increased collagen and galectin-3 expression. 5-Aza reduced abnormal DNA methylation and restored the MMP-9/TIMP-1, -2 balance. In conclusion, our data suggest that during HHcy, abnormal DNA methylation and an imbalance between MMP-9 and TIMP-1 and -2 lead to ECM remodeling and renal fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W1584728627,"Various bacteria perform anaerobic degradation of small hydrocarbons as a source of energy and cellular carbon. To activate non-reactive hydrocarbons such as toluene, enzymes conjugate these molecules to fumarate in a radical-catalyzed, C—C bond-forming reaction. We have determined x-ray crystal structures of the glycyl radical enzyme that catalyzes the addition of toluene to fumarate, benzylsuccinate synthase (BSS), in two oligomeric states with fumarate alone or with both substrates. We find that fumarate is secured at the bottom of a long active site cavity with toluene bound directly above it. The two substrates adopt orientations that appear ideal for radical-mediated C—C bond formation; the methyl group of toluene is positioned between fumarate and a cysteine that forms a thiyl radical during catalysis, which is in turn adjacent to the glycine that serves as a radical storage residue. Toluene is held in place by fumarate on one face and tight packing by hydrophobic residues on the other face and sides. These hydrophobic residues appear to become ordered, thus encapsulating toluene, only in the presence of BSSβ, a small protein subunit that forms a tight complex with BSSα, the catalytic subunit.

Anaerobic metabolism of aromatic compounds.Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2008; 1125: 82-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In the presence of oxygen, a wide range of bacteria and some fungi initiate metabolism of aromatic hydrocarbons and alkanes through direct oxidation by mono- or dioxygenases followed by β oxidation of the resulting hydroxylated fragments. In the absence of oxygen, hydrocarbon functionalization is more challenging, and different strategies are required. Experiments with the denitrifying bacterium Thauera aromatica have revealed the details of a microbial toluene degradation pathway. The first step in this pathway is reaction of toluene with fumarate to give R-benzylsuccinate, which is catalyzed by the enzyme benzylsuccinate synthase (BSS) 2The abbreviations used are: BSSbenzylsuccinate synthasearyl-SSaryl-succinate synthaseXSSX-succinate synthaseGREglycyl radical enzymeHBSS4-hydroxybenzyl-SSNMSSnaphthyl-2-methyl-SSMASS(1-methylalkyl)succinate synthaseIBSS4-isopropylbenzyl-SS.

Together these enzymes form a large family of X-succinate synthases (XSSs) responsible for functionalization of a wide variety of hydrocarbon substrates, and the range of substrates is still growing. The C—C bond-forming reaction performed by BSS and its relatives requires an oxygen-sensitive radical cofactor. BSS is a member of the glycyl radical enzyme (GRE) family and contains a backbone glycyl radical in its activated form. Other members of this family include the central metabolic enzymes pyruvate formate lyase and anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase and several radical eliminases (15Craciun S. Balskus E.P.

All of these radical enzymes are believed to generate a substrate-based radical that undergoes rearrangement in the active site to generate a product-based radical, which is reduced by the enzyme to regenerate the glycyl radical. In all GREs thus far studied, an enzyme-based thiyl radical is proposed to be an intermediary between the glycyl- and substrate-based radical species (17Becker A. Kabsch W.

The cysteine proposed to form the thiyl radical initiates radical chemistry on the substrate, whereas the glycine is the radical storage site. Radical chemistry in GREs occurs deep within the core of a 10-stranded β/α barrel where reactive radical species are protected. At the barrel core, a loop containing the essential glycine (the Gly loop) is juxtaposed with the loop containing the catalytic cysteine residue (the Cys loop) allowing for hydrogen atom transfer between the two. Residues surrounding these loops compose the active site. BSS exists as an (αβγ)2 heterohexamer (Fig. 1C). BSSα contains the 10-stranded barrel and is the catalytic subunit, whereas BSSβ and BSSγ are both small, [4Fe-4S]-cluster-containing proteins of unknown function (19Leuthner B. Leutwein C. Schulz H.

Despite the fact that the roles of BSSβ and BSSγ are unclear, both proteins are required for viable growth of T. aromatica strain T1 on toluene (21Bhandare R. Calabro M. Coschigano P.W.

We previously solved structures of the BSSαβγ and BSSαγ complexes, revealing that removal of BSSβ from the complex with BSSαγ permits a large conformational change within BSSα (23Funk M.A. Judd E.T. Marsh E.N. Elliott S.J. Drennan C.L. Structures of benzylsuccinate synthase elucidate roles of accessory subunits in glycyl radical enzyme activation and activity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2014; 111: 10161-10166Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The core barrel opens, exposing the active site, and a C-terminal domain that harbors the Gly loop (the glycyl radical domain) shifts a few ångströms out of the active site but does not completely vacate the barrel. Movement of the glycyl radical domain away from the barrel core is expected to be required for the initial installation of the glycyl radical by the cognate S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) radical-activating enzyme (24Vey J.L. Yang J. Li M. Broderick W.E. Broderick J.B. Drennan C.L. Structural basis for glycyl radical formation by pyruvate formate lyase activating enzyme.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 16137-16141Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Thus, in the absence of BSSβ, the enzyme adopts an open state that appears amenable to activation, whereas in the presence of BSSβ the enzyme adopts a closed state that appears ready for catalysis, with the glycyl radical domain positioned for radical transfer. We identified a channel that substrates could take to enter the active site; however, BSSβ appeared to block the channel entrance, suggesting either that substrates cannot bind in the presence of BSSβ or that BSSβ plays a role in gating active site accessibility. Here we have turned again to crystallography, this time to explore substrate binding in BSS. Given that neither we nor other groups (25Hilberg M. Anaerober Toluol-Stoffwechsel in Thauera aromatica: Biochemische und spektroskopische Untersuchungen zur Reaktion der (R)-Benzylsuccinat Synthase. Philipps-Universität Marburg, 2012Google Scholar) have been able to purify the requisite activating enzyme for BSS, thus impeding mutagenesis and other in vitro biochemical studies, crystallography has proven to be an excellent tool to probe what would otherwise be a largely intractable enzyme system. In particular, our current study investigates how BSS binds to fumarate and toluene in both αβγ and αγ complexes. We find that both substrates can bind to the BSSαβγ complex, thus demonstrating that the presence of BSSβ does not prevent substrate access into the active site. Fumarate binding to BSSαγ partially shifts the barrel from the open state observed in the substrate-free BSSαγ structure toward the closed state seen in BSSαβγ. However, ordering of BSSα into the fully closed, catalytic state does not occur in this structure in the absence of BSSβ; only structures with BSSαβγ depict the fully closed, catalytically competent state. In this closed state, both substrates are bound at the bottom of the proposed channel in an orientation in which toluene is ideally positioned to undergo hydrogen atom abstraction by the putative, transient thiyl radical followed by C—C bond formation between toluene and fumarate. Finally, we have constructed homology models of other members of the XSS family based on the structure of BSS to predict the determinants of specificity in these enzymes. This analysis will aid in characterization of the diverse communities of microbes known to cooperate in the degradation of hydrocarbons. BSSαβγ and BSSαγ were purified (20Li L. Patterson D.P.

Initial crystals were discovered using screens dispensed by a TPP Labtech Mosquito liquid-handling robot housed in a room-temperature, N2-filled, MBraun anaerobic chamber with O2 < 0.1 ppm. All subsequent crystallizations were performed in this chamber using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method and reagents from Hampton Research. In particular, BSSαβγ at 8 mg ml−1 in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 15% (v/v) glycerol, and 200 mm NaCl was added at a 2:1 ratio to well solution containing 25% (w/v) PEG 3350, 100 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 60 mm KCl, and 5 mm fumarate. 1–2 μl of toluene was added to the bottom of the well and allowed to diffuse slowly into the protein drop. Diffraction-quality crystals grew over the course of 3 weeks. Crystals were soaked in a cryoprotection solution containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 25% (w/v) PEG 3350, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mm fumarate for 30 s before cryocooling. Crystals indexed in space group P21212 (a = 141.5, b = 115.4, c = 121.7 Å) with two molecules per asymmetric unit. This crystal form is different from that observed before for substrate-free BSSαβγ (space group I222; a = 113.4, b = 120.4, c = 136.0 Å), but the packing interactions are virtually identical, with small changes accounting for the lower crystallographic symmetry. BSSαγ at 15 mg ml−1 in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm fumarate was mixed in a 1:1 ratio with precipitant solution containing 20% (w/v) PEG 400, 50 mm Bis-Tris, pH 6.5, 25 mm Tris pH 8.0 and incubated over a well of the same solution at room temperature. Crystals formed in several days and were pale yellow. Crystals were soaked in a solution containing 30% (w/v) PEG 400, 50 mm Bis-Tris 6.5, 25 mm Tris 8.0, and 50 mm sodium fumarate for 5–10 min before cryocooling. Crystals indexed in space group P43212 (a = b = 154.9, c = 82.1 Å) with one molecule per asymmetric unit. Crystals were cryocooled in liquid nitrogen in a Coy anaerobic chamber filled with 95% Ar, 5% H2. All data were collected at the National Synchrotron Light Source beamline X26C on a Quantum-4 ASDC CCD detector at a wavelength of 1.000 Å (Table 1). Data were indexed and scaled in HKL2000 (26Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Processing of x-ray diffraction data collected in oscillation mode.Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38526) Google Scholar). The diffraction data for fumarate-bound BSSαγ were strongly anisotropic along the c axis as determined by the programs Truncate and phenix.xtriage. Due to this anisotropic diffraction, many of the high resolution reflections measured along the c axis displayed weak intensities, affecting both the signal-to-noise ratio in the high resolution bin and the overall completeness of data with intensities above zero (Table 1). To compensate for this issue with the data, all map calculations were performed with anisotropy corrections in Phenix, which improved map quality. Inclusion of the weak high resolution data to 2.0 Å resolution yielded maps with finer detail than when these data were truncated. The usefulness of the high resolution data is also indicated by the CC1/2 value of ∼0.7, which is obtained for all data to 2.0 Å resolution. The fumarate- and toluene-bound BSSαβγ diffraction data were also anisotropic but to a less severe degree.TABLE 1X-ray diffraction data processing statisticsData collectionFumarate- and toluene-bound BSSαβγFumarate-bound BSSαγResolution (Å)40.0-3.30 (3.36-3.30)35.0-2.00 (2.03-2.00)Completeness,aThe data sets were anisotropic along the c-axis, resulting in a large number of weak reflections (see “Experimental Procedures”). all data98.9 (95.4)97.0 (80.4)Completeness, I ≥ 091.7 (75.6)86.9 (76.7)aThe data sets were anisotropic along the c-axis, resulting in a large number of weak reflections (see “Experimental Procedures”).〈I/σI〉9.6 (1.3)11.8 (1.4)Rmerge0.10 (>1)0.09 (0.90)Unique reflections3031165770Redundancy3.8 (3.5)5.6 (2.8)CC1/2(0.669)(0.700)a The data sets were anisotropic along the c-axis, resulting in a large number of weak reflections (see “Experimental Procedures”).

Due to the low resolution of this dataset, refinement was tightly restrained with the high resolution model as a reference structure in phenix.refine. The final model (Table 2) contains residues 9–865 (of 865 native residues) in BSSα, 13–81 (of 81) in BSSβ, and 11–47 (of 60) BSSγ.

Composite omit maps calculated by phenix.autobuild were used to verify positions and identity of ligands and active site residues in both structures.

Parameter files for toluene (methylbenzene, Protein Data Bank Ligand ID MBN) were obtained from the CCP4 database. The atomic coordinates and structure factors for the fumarate-bound structure of BSSαγ and fumarate- and toluene-bound structure of BSSαβγ have been deposited in the Protein DataBank under accession numbers 5BWD and 5BWE. Models of the catalytic subunit of 4-isopropylbenzyl-SS (IBSS; GenBankTM ID AIS23708.1), 4-hydroxybenzyl-SS (HBSS; CCK78655.1), naphthyl-2-methyl-SS (NMSS; ADB04297.1), and 1-methylalkyl)succinate synthase (MASS; CAO03074.1) were constructed with Modeler v9.1 (30Eswar N.

The models have Discrete Optimized Protein Energy scores ranging from −96,600 to −10,700. Ligand models for docking were prepared in phenix.eLBOW. Docking of aryl-SS substrates was performed manually based on the position of toluene in the active site of BSSαβγ. To investigate how substrates bind, we incubated BSSαβγ with fumarate and toluene before crystallization. Crystals produced by this method diffract to 3.3 Å resolution (Table 1). Omit electron density peaks in the central active site can be modeled as molecules of fumarate and toluene (Fig. 2A). Substrate-bound BSSαβγ adopts the same closed state observed previously in substrate-free BSSαβγ (23Funk M.A. Judd E.T. Marsh E.N. Elliott S.J. Drennan C.L.

As expected, the substrates are bound at the bottom of the proposed access channel. This channel is formed by two helices outside the core barrel, α3′ and α8′, and a loop between α1′ and β1. Together these elements contribute residues Val-185, Glu-189, Ala-308, Tyr-381, Ile-384, and Leu-711 (Fig. 3), forming a contraction at the midway point that appears to restrict movement of substrates and solvent in or out of the active site. In addition to residues from BSSα, a hairpin loop from BSSβ is inserted within the putative access channel and appears to completely block access to the active site. Although these structural data show that substrates can bind to BSS in the presence of BSSβ, it remains unclear what conformational changes are required for passage of substrates into the active site within the full BSSαβγ complex.FIGURE 3A putative substrate access channel in BSS. The van der Waals surface of BSS is shown as a cutaway with substrates (cyan) bound in the central active site cavity above the Cys loop. As noted before (23Funk M.A. Judd E.T. Marsh E.N.

In particular, a hairpin loop of BSSβ inserts into this cavity, filling it completely. The channel also has a bottleneck at the midway point (labeled residues are shown as sticks).

Cytokines participate in its pathogenesis and may contribute to early diagnosis improving the outcome. This study aimed to evaluate the cytokine profile in IE. Serum concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α were measured by cytometric bead array (CBA) at diagnosis in 81 IE patients, and compared with 34 healthy subjects and 30 patients with non-IE infections, matched to the IE patients by age and gender. Mean age of the IE patients was 47±17 years (range, 15–80 years), and 40 (50%) were male. The IE patients had significantly higher serum concentrations of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and TNF-α as compared to the healthy individuals. The median levels of IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-12 were higher in the IE than in the non-IE infections group. TNF-α and IL-12 levels were higher in staphylococcal IE than in the non-staphylococcal IE subgroup. There was a higher proportion of both low IL-10 producers and high producers of IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-12 in the staphylococcal IE than in the non-staphylococcal IE subgroup. This study reinforces a relationship between the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, especially IL-1β, IL-12 and TNF-α, and the pathogenesis of IE. A lower production of IL-10 and impairment in cytokine network may reflect the severity of IE and may be useful for risk stratification."

Scathophagidae) and root maggot flies (F. Anthomyiidae). It is comprised of approximately 7000 described species. The monophyly of the Muscoidea and the precise relationships of muscoids to the closest superfamily the Oestroidea (blow flies, flesh flies etc) are both unresolved. Until now mitochondrial (mt) genomes were available for only two of the four muscoid families precluding a thorough test of phylogenetic relationships using this data source. Here we present the first two mt genomes for the families Fanniidae (Euryomma sp.) (family Fanniidae) and Anthomyiidae (Delia platura (Meigen, 1826)). We also conducted phylogenetic analyses containing of these newly sequenced mt genomes plus 15 other species representative of dipteran diversity to address the internal relationship of Muscoidea and its systematic position. Both maximum-likelihood and Bayesian analyses suggested that Muscoidea was not a monophyletic group with the relationship: (Fanniidae + Muscidae) + ((Anthomyiidae + Scathophagidae) + (Calliphoridae + Sarcophagidae)), supported by the majority of analysed datasets. This also infers that Oestroidea was paraphyletic in the majority of analyses. Divergence time estimation suggested that the earliest split within the Calyptratae, separating (Tachinidae + Oestridae) from the remaining families, occurred in the Early Eocene. The main divergence within the paraphyletic muscoidea grade was between Fanniidae + Muscidae and the lineage ((Anthomyiidae + Scathophagidae) + (Calliphoridae + Sarcophagidae)) which occurred in the Late Eocene."

https://openalex.org/W1007772811,"The aim of the current study was to localize the epileptic focus and characterize its causal relation with other brain regions, to understand the cognitive deficits in children with benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS). Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed in 37 children with BECTS and 25 children matched for age, sex and educational achievement. We identified the potential epileptogenic zone (EZ) by comparing the amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) of spontaneous blood oxygenation level dependent fMRI signals between the groups. Granger causality analysis was applied to explore the causal effect between EZ and the whole brain. Compared with controls, children with BECTS had significantly increased ALFF in the right postcentral gyrus and bilateral calcarine, and decreased ALFF in the left anterior cingulate cortex, bilateral putaman/caudate, and left cerebellum. ALFF values in the putaman/caudate were positively correlated with verbal IQ scores in patients. The ALFF values in cerebellum and performance IQ scores were negatively correlated in patients. These results suggest that ALFF disturbances in the putaman/caudate and cerebellum play an important role in BECTS cognitive dysfunction. Compared with controls, the patients showed increased driving effect from the EZ to the right medial frontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex and decreased causal effects from the EZ to left inferior frontal gyrus. The causal effect of the left inferior frontal gyrus negatively correlated with disease duration, which suggests a relation between the epileptiform activity and language impairment. All together, these findings provide additional insight into the neurophysiological mechanisms of epilepitogenisis and cognitive dysfunction associated with BECTS."

Here we asked whether blind individuals treated with a retinal prosthesis could also benefit from using the resultant new visual signal together with non-visual information when navigating. Four patients (blind for 15-52 years) implanted with the Argus II retinal prosthesis (Second Sight Medical Products Inc. Sylmar, CA), and five age-matched and six younger controls, participated. Participants completed a path reproduction and a triangle completion navigation task, using either an indirect visual landmark and non-visual self-motion cues or non-visual self-motion cues only. Control participants wore goggles that approximated the field of view and the resolution of the Argus II prosthesis. In both tasks, control participants showed better precision when navigating with reduced vision, compared to without vision. Patients, however, did not show similar improvements when navigating with the prosthesis in the path reproduction task, but two patients did show improvements in the triangle completion task. Additionally, all patients showed greater precision than controls in both tasks when navigating without vision. These results indicate that the Argus II retinal prosthesis may not provide sufficiently reliable visual information to improve the precision of patients on tasks, for which they have learnt to rely on non-visual senses."
https://openalex.org/W2220510462,"Human ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7) is a deubiquitinating enzyme that prevents protein degradation by removing polyubiquitin chains from its substrates. It regulates the stability of a number of human transcription factors and tumor suppressors and plays a critical role in the development of several types of cancer, including prostate and small cell lung cancer. In addition, human USP7 is targeted by several viruses of the Herpesviridae family and is required for effective herpesvirus infection. The USP7 C-terminal region (C-USP7) contains five ubiquitin-like domains (UBL1–5) that interact with several USP7 substrates. Although structures of the USP7 C terminus bound to its substrates could provide vital information for understanding USP7 substrate specificity, no such data has been available to date. In this work we have demonstrated that the USP7 ubiquitin-like domains can be studied in isolation by solution NMR spectroscopy, and we have determined the structure of the UBL1 domain. Furthermore, we have employed NMR and viral plaque assays to probe the interaction between the C-USP7 and HSV-1 immediate-early protein ICP0 (infected cell protein 0), which is essential for efficient lytic infection and virus reactivation from latency. We have shown that depletion of the USP7 in HFF-1 cells negatively affects the efficiency of HSV-1 lytic infection. We have also found that USP7 directly binds ICP0 via its C-terminal UBL1–2 domains and mapped the USP7-binding site for ICP0. Therefore, this study represents a first step toward understanding the molecular mechanism of C-USP7 specificity toward its substrates and may provide the basis for future development of novel antiviral and anticancer therapies.

In this work we have demonstrated that the USP7 ubiquitin-like domains can be studied in isolation by solution NMR spectroscopy, and we have determined the structure of the UBL1 domain. Furthermore, we have employed NMR and viral plaque assays to probe the interaction between the C-USP7 and HSV-1 immediate-early protein ICP0 (infected cell protein 0), which is essential for efficient lytic infection and virus reactivation from latency. We have shown that depletion of the USP7 in HFF-1 cells negatively affects the efficiency of HSV-1 lytic infection. We have also found that USP7 directly binds ICP0 via its C-terminal UBL1–2 domains and mapped the USP7-binding site for ICP0. Therefore, this study represents a first step toward understanding the molecular mechanism of C-USP7 specificity toward its substrates and may provide the basis for future development of novel antiviral and anticancer therapies. Conjugation of ubiquitin to target proteins is important in multiple cellular processes, including signaling cascades, proteasomal degradation, and protein localization. Mono- and polyubiquitination can be reversed by deubiquitinating enzymes, which cleave the isopeptide bond between ubiquitin and a substrate. Ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7), also known as herpesvirus-associated ubiquitin-specific protease (HAUSP), is a 135-kDa cysteine isopeptidase (1Nijman S.M. Luna-Vargas M.P. Velds A.

Misregulation of the USP7 was linked to multiple human pathologies, including prostate and non-small cell lung cancers (2Song M.S. Salmena L. Carracedo A. Egia A. Lo-Coco F. Teruya-Feldstein J.

A number of USP7 substrates have been identified, and USP7 knockdown was shown to affect cellular levels of at least 36 proteins in LS174T colon carcinoma cells (4Kessler B.M. Fortunati E. Melis M.

Among a variety of substrates, the USP7 deubiquitinates both p53 tumor suppressor and its main regulator E3 ligase Hdm2 (human double minute 2) and thus plays a central role in maintaining an appropriate p53 level in the cell (5Li M.

Other important targets of USP7 include several transcription factors such as FOX(O)4, PTEN, NF-κB, and HLTF; DNA replication and repair proteins such as UbE2E1, claspin, and MCM-BP; and proteins involved in epigenetic control of gene expression such as DNMT1 and PRC1 (2Song M.S.

In addition to cellular substrates, USP7 is known to interact with proteins from all three subfamilies of the Herpesviridae family of viruses. Specifically, it interacts with immediate-early protein ICP0 from herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1), which is required for efficient lytic infection and reactivation of latent and quiescent viral genomes (16Everett R.D.

USP7 also binds two proteins from Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), LANA and vIRF4 (17Lee H.R. Choi W.C. Lee S. Hwang J. Hwang E. Guchhait K. Haas J. Toth Z. Jeon Y.H. Oh T.K. Kim M.H.

LANA is the major viral protein expressed in all forms of KSHV-associated malignancies, and vlRF4 is the key player in the switch from latency to lytic reactivation (17Lee H.R. Choi W.C. Lee S.

USP7 also interacts with the EBNA1 protein from Epstein-Barr virus, which competes with the p53 transcription factor for USP7 binding (19Holowaty M.N. Sheng Y. Nguyen T. Arrowsmith C. Frappier L.

Thus, USP7 binding to EBNA1 results in p53 destabilization and blockage of the DNA damage response caused by Epstein-Barr virus infection (19Holowaty M.N. Sheng Y. Nguyen T. Arrowsmith C. Frappier L.

Finally, USP7 binds the UL35 protein from cytomegalovirus essential for viral replication and particle formation (21Salsman J. Jagannathan M. Paladino P. Chan P.K. Dellaire G. Raught B. Frappier L. Proteomic profiling of the human cytomegalovirus UL35 gene products reveals a role for UL35 in the DNA repair response.J. Virol. 2012; 86: 806-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In addition to herpesvirus targets, USP7 was recently shown to interact with at least one adenoviral protein, E1B-55K, a component of the E1B-55K·E4-orf6 E3 ligase complex that degrades a wide range of intracellular proteins. Down-regulation or specific inhibition of USP7 destabilizes E1B-55K and negatively affects viral replication (22Ching W. Koyuncu E. Singh S. Arbelo-Roman C. Hartl B. Kremmer E. Speiseder T. Meier C.

Because of the central role USP7 plays in viral infection and cancer development pathways, it represents an attractive target for the design of new antiviral and anticancer therapies. Although knowledge of molecular mechanisms of USP7 specificity toward its diverse substrates is essential for drug development, to date these mechanisms remain poorly understood. Structurally, USP7 consists of an N-terminal substrate-binding TRAF-like domain followed by a ubiquitin-binding catalytic domain and a large 64-kDa C-terminal region (C-USP7, residues 557–1102) that contains five ubiquitin-like domains (UBL1–5) 2The abbreviations used are: UBLubiquitin-likePDBProtein Data BankITCisothermal titration calorimetrym.o.i.multiplicity of infectionCTDC-terminal domain. shown in Fig. 1A (19Holowaty M.N.

Remarkably, all these substrates share a common USP7-binding (P/A)XXS motif and interact with the same site located in the TRAF-like domain. The function of the USP7 C-terminal UBL domains remains largely unknown. Interestingly, UBL domains were found in at least 16 members of the USP family. All of them share a characteristic β-grasp ubiquitin fold, although their sequence similarity to ubiquitin may be very limited. Although a few of these UBLs have been characterized, the functions of others, including UBLs of the USP9, USP24, USP34, USP47 and USP48 remain elusive (27Faesen A.C. Luna-Vargas M.P. Sixma T.K. The role of UBL domains in ubiquitin-specific proteases.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2012; 40: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The ICP0 E3 ligase from HSV-1 is the first USP7 substrate shown to interact exclusively with C-USP7, suggesting that the UBL domains may function as a platform for substrate binding. Recent studies revealed that the USP7 C-terminal region contains additional binding sites for p53 and Hdm2, as well as for the transcription factor FOX(O)4, which interacts exclusively with the C terminus (9van der Horst A. de Vries-Smits A.M.

Here, we report a structural study of the C-USP7/substrate interaction. With the use of NMR spectroscopy, we have shown that individual USP7 UBL domains and/or two-domain constructs are stable in isolation and can be studied independently in solution. Furthermore, we have determined solution NMR structure of the USP7 UBL1 domain and demonstrated that it is nearly identical to the crystal structure of the UBL1 in the context of the intact C terminus (25Faesen A.C. Dirac A.M. Shanmugham A. Ovaa H. Perrakis A. Sixma T.K. Mechanism of USP7/HAUSP activation by its C-terminal ubiquitin-like domain and allosteric regulation by GMP-synthetase.Mol.

Finally, we have characterized the interaction between C-USP7 and the ICP0 protein from HSV-1 virus and mapped the ICP0 binding interface on the surface of the UBL1-UBL2 domains. Our work represents the first structural study of the USP-substrate recognition mediated by its UBL domains. Because many of the USPs contain multiple UBLs (27Faesen A.C. Luna-Vargas M.P. Sixma T.K. The role of UBL domains in ubiquitin-specific proteases.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2012; 40: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), it is likely that substrate recognition by the UBL domains may prove to be a common feature shared among a class of UBL-containing USPs. Sequences encoding UBL1 (residues 537–664), UBL12 (residues 535–775), UBL3 (residues 775–888), and UBL45 (residues 884–1102) domains of the human USP7 were subcloned into pET28a-LIC vector (Structural Genomics Consortium). All proteins were purified following the same protocol. Plasmids containing recombinant proteins with the N-terminal His6 tag were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) strain. Proteins were expressed in M9 minimal medium containing 15NH4Cl (and [13C]glucose for production of the 15N/13C-labeled UBL1). 15N/13C-labeled deuterated UBL12 was expressed in 100% D2O-based M9 medium using [13C/2H]glucose as the sole carbon source. Transformed cells were grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.6–0.8. Protein expression was induced by adding 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside followed by incubation overnight at 20 °C. Cells were harvested, resuspended in buffer containing 20 mm NaH2PO4, 250 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 1 mm PMSF, pH 7.4, lysed by sonication, and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 45 min. The supernatant was applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column, and proteins were eluted with a buffer containing 20 mm NaH2PO4, 250 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, pH 7.4. Following thrombin or Tobacco Etch Virus protease digestion to remove the His6 tag, proteins were additionally purified using either HiLoad Superdex 75 (for UBL1 and UBL3) or HiLoad Superdex 200 (for UBL12 and UBL45) columns (GE Healthcare). Final samples used for NMR experiments contained 0.8–1.2 mm of purified protein, 20 mm NaH2PO4, 250 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, pH 7.0. The 15N/13C-labeled UBL1 sample additionally contained 0.5 mm PMSF, 1 mm benzamidine, and 1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine. 1H-15N HSQC spectra for all C-USP7 constructs were recorded on 800 MHz (1H) Agilent VNMRS spectrometer at 25 °C. All experiments for the UBL1 structural calculation were acquired on 600 and 800 MHz (1H) Bruker Avance spectrometers at 25 °C. The data were processed with NMRPipe (29Delaglio F. Grzesiek S.

Heteronuclear NOE values were calculated as ratios of peak intensities in corresponding two-dimensional 1H–15N correlation spectra. Errors in NOE values were calculated based on peak intensities and the measured spectral noise levels. ICP0 binding to individual USP7 UBL domains was assessed by a series of titration experiments monitored by recording 800 MHz (1H) 1H-15N HSQC spectra of the domains. Peptide GPRKCARKTRH corresponding to ICP0 residues 617–627 was custom-synthesized (GenScript). The titrations were performed by gradual addition of the unlabeled peptide to ∼0.5 mm 15N-labeled UBL domain samples (up to 1:10 protein to peptide ratio). Both the wild-type UBL1 and C576S mutant constructs were tested, providing identical results. Frequency (chemical shift) perturbations were calculated for each amino acid residue as Δωi = (ΔωN2 + ΔωH2)1/2, where ΔωN and ΔωH are 15N and 1H frequency differences between ICP0-bound and free states, respectively. The obtained Δωi values were mapped onto the surface of the crystal structure of the UBL12 tandem (PDB code 2YLM) (25Faesen A.C. Dirac A.M. Shanmugham A. Ovaa H. Perrakis A. Sixma T.K.

The latter could contribute to spreading of these bacteria or their resistance genes to humans. Several studies have reported the isolation of third generation cephalosporin resistant bacteria in livestock animals. However, the number of samples and the methodology used differ considerably between studies limiting comparability and prevalence assessment. In the present study, a total of 564 manure and dust samples were collected from 47 pig farms in Northern Germany and analysed to determine the prevalence of ESBL-E. Molecular typing and characterization of resistance genes was performed for all ESBL-E isolates. ESBL-E isolates were found in 55.3% of the farms. ESBL-Escherichia coli was found in 18.8% of the samples, ESBL-Klebsiella pneumoniae in 0.35%. The most prevalent ESBL genes among E. coli were CTX-M-1 like (68.9%), CTX-M-15 like (16%) and CTX-M-9 group (14.2%). In 20% of the latter two, also the OXA-1 like gene was found resulting in a combination of genes typical for isolates from humans. Genetic relation was found between isolates not only from the same, but also from different farms, with multilocus sequence type (ST) 10 being predominant among the E. coli isolates. In conclusion, we showed possible spread of ESBL-E between farms and the presence of resistance genes and STs previously shown to be associated with human isolates. Follow-up studies are required to monitor the extent and pathways of ESBL-E transmission between farms, animals and humans."
https://openalex.org/W1836438072,"Lipoprotein components are crucial factors for hepatitis C virus (HCV) assembly and entry. As hepatoma cells producing cell culture-derived HCV (HCVcc) particles are impaired in some aspects of lipoprotein metabolism, it is of upmost interest to biochemically and functionally characterize the in vivo produced viral particles, particularly regarding how lipoprotein components modulate HCV entry by lipid transfer receptors such as scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI). Sera from HCVcc-infected liver humanized FRG mice were separated by density gradients. Viral subpopulations, termed HCVfrg particles, were characterized for their physical properties, apolipoprotein association, and infectivity. We demonstrate that, in contrast to the widely spread distribution of apolipoproteins across the different HCVcc subpopulations, the most infectious HCVfrg particles are highly enriched in apoE, suggesting that such apolipoprotein enrichment plays a role for entry of in vivo derived infectious particles likely via usage of apolipoprotein receptors. Consistent with this salient feature, we further reveal previously undefined functionalities of SR-BI in promoting entry of in vivo produced HCV. First, unlike HCVcc, SR-BI is a particularly limiting factor for entry of HCVfrg subpopulations of very low density. Second, HCVfrg entry involves SR-BI lipid transfer activity but not its capacity to bind to the viral glycoprotein E2. In conclusion, we demonstrate that composition and biophysical properties of the different subpopulations of in vivo produced HCVfrg particles modulate their levels of infectivity and receptor usage, hereby featuring divergences with in vitro produced HCVcc particles and highlighting the powerfulness of this in vivo model for the functional study of the interplay between HCV and liver components."

Thus, a profound understanding of the pathophysiologic changes in HFpEF is needed to identify risk factors and potential treatment targets in this specific patient population. Therefore, we aimed to comprehensively assess the impact of left- and right-ventricular function and hemodynamics on long-term mortality and morbidity in order to improve risk prediction in patients with HFpEF.We prospectively included 142 consecutive patients with HFpEF into our observational, non-interventional registry. Echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and invasive hemodynamic assessments including myocardial biopsy were performed at baseline. We detected significant correlations between left ventricular extracellular matrix and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (r = -0.64;p = 0.03) and stroke volume (r = -0.53;p = 0.04). Hospitalization for heart failure and/or cardiac death was observed over a median follow up of 10 months. The strongest risk factors were reduced right ventricular function (adj. HR 6.62;95%CI 3.12- 14.02;p<0.001), systolic pulmonary arterial pressure (adj. HR per 1-SD 1.55;95%CI 1.15- 2.09;p = 0.004) and the pulmonary artery wedge pressure (adj. HR per 1-SD 1.51;95%CI 1.09-2.08; p = 0.012). The area under the ROC curve for right ventricular function was 0.63, for systolic pulmonary arterial pressure 0.75, and for pulmonary artery wedge pressure 0.68.The current study emphasizes the importance of right ventricular function and pulmonary pressures on outcome in patients with HFpEF providing pathophysiological insights into the hemodynamic changes in HFpEF."
https://openalex.org/W1620503186,"Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), also known as premature ovarian failure (POF), is defined as more than six months of cessation of menses before the age of 40 years, with two serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels (at least 1 month apart) falling in the menopause range. The cause of POI remains undetermined in the majority of cases, although some studies have reported increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in idiopathic POF. The role of mitochondrial DNA in the pathogenesis of POI has not been studied extensively. This aim of this study was to uncover underlying mitochondrial genetic defects in patients with POI. The entire region of the mitochondrial genome was amplified in subjects with idiopathic POI (n=63) and age-matched healthy female controls (n=63) using nine pair sets of primers, followed by screening of the mitochondrial genome using an Illumina MiSeq. We identified a total of 96 non-synonymous mitochondrial variations in POI patients and 93 non-synonymous variations in control subjects. Of these, 21 (9 in POI and 12 in control) non-synonymous variations had not been reported previously. Eight mitochondrial cytochrome coxidase 1 (MT-CO1) missense variants were identified in POI patients, whereas only four missense mutations were observed in controls. A high incidence of MT-CO1 missense variants were identified in POI patients compared with controls, and the difference between the groups was statistically significant (13/63 vs. 5/63, p=0.042). Our results show that patients with primary ovarian insufficiency exhibit an increased incidence of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase 1 gene mutations, suggesting that MT-CO1 gene mutation may be causal in POI."
https://openalex.org/W2151988397,"Regular meal consumption is considered an important aspect of a healthy diet. While ample evidence shows social inequalities in breakfast skipping among adolescents, little is known about social inequalities in breakfast skipping and skipping of other meals among young school-aged children. Such information is crucial in targeting interventions aimed to promote a healthy diet in children.We examined data from 4704 ethnically diverse children participating in the Generation R Study, a population-based prospective cohort study in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Information on family socioeconomic position (SEP), ethnic background, and meal skipping behaviors was assessed by parent-reported questionnaire when the child was 6 years old. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the associations of family SEP (educational level, household income, employment status, family composition) and ethnic background with meal skipping behaviors, using high SEP children and native Dutch children as reference groups.Meal skipping prevalence ranged from 3% (dinner) to 11% (lunch). The prevalence of meal skipping was higher among low SEP children and ethnic minority children. Maternal educational level was independently associated with breakfast skipping ([low maternal educational level] OR: 2.21; 95% CI: 1.24,3.94). Paternal educational level was independently associated with lunch skipping ([low paternal educational level] OR: 1.53; 95% CI: 1.06,2.20) and dinner skipping ([mid-high paternal educational level] OR: 0.39; 95% CI: 0.20,0.76). Household income was independently associated with breakfast skipping ([low income] OR: 2.43, 95% CI: 1.40,4.22) and dinner skipping ([low income] OR: 2.44; 95% CI: 1.22,4.91). In general, ethnic minority children were more likely to skip breakfast, lunch, and dinner compared with native Dutch children. Adjustment for family SEP attenuated the associations of ethnic minority background with meal skipping behaviors considerably.Low SEP children and ethnic minority children are at an increased risk of breakfast, lunch, and dinner skipping compared with high SEP children and native Dutch children, respectively. Given these inequalities, interventions aimed to promote regular meal consumption, breakfast consumption in particular, should target children from low socioeconomic groups and ethnic minority children. More qualitative research to investigate the pathways underlying social inequalities in children's meal skipping behaviors is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W997541941,"Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a natural oxidant produced by aerobic organisms and gives rise to oxidative damage, including DNA mutations, protein inactivation and lipid damage. The genus Mycobacterium utilizes redox sensors and H2O2 scavenging enzymes for the detoxification of H2O2. To date, the precise response to oxidative stress has not been fully elucidated. Here, we compared the effects of different levels of H2O2 on transcription in M. smegmatis using RNA-sequencing. A 0.2 mM H2O2 treatment had little effect on the growth and viability of M. smegmatis whereas 7 mM H2O2 was lethal. Analysis of global transcription showed that 0.2 mM H2O2 induced relatively few changes in gene expression, whereas a large proportion of the mycobacterial genome was found to be differentially expressed after treatment with 7 mM H2O2. Genes differentially expressed following treatment with 0.2 mM H2O2 included those coding for proteins involved in glycolysis-gluconeogenesis and fatty acid metabolism pathways, and expression of most genes encoding ribosomal proteins was lower following treatment with 7 mM H2O2. Our analysis shows that M. smegmatis utilizes the sigma factor MSMEG_5214 in response to 0.2 mM H2O2, and the RpoE1 sigma factors MSMEG_0573 and MSMEG_0574 in response to 7 mM H2O2. In addition, different transcriptional regulators responded to different levels of H2O2: MSMEG_1919 was induced by 0.2 mM H2O2, while high-level induction of DevR occurred in response to 7 mM H2O2. We detected the induction of different detoxifying enzymes, including genes encoding KatG, AhpD, TrxB and Trx, at different levels of H2O2 and the detoxifying enzymes were expressed at different levels of H2O2. In conclusion, our study reveals the changes in transcription that are induced in response to different levels of H2O2 in M. smegmatis."
https://openalex.org/W1825986551,"Apoptosis is a known regulator of morphogenetic events. In mammals, the critical role of oxidative stress-induced apoptosis has been well-studied; however, in insects the role of oxidative stress in apoptosis is not clear. In a previous study, we showed that apoptosis-related genes are present in the silkworm Bombyx mori, an important lepidopteran insect model. In this study, we evaluated the effect of H2O2-induced oxidative stress on apoptosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, mitochondrial response, cytochrome c release and apoptosis-related gene expression in the BmN-SWU1 cell line from B. mori ovaries. Our results showed that BmN-SWU1 cells exposed to H2O2 showed cell protuberances, cytoplasmic condensation, apoptotic bodies, DNA ladder formation and caspase activities indicating apoptosis. H2O2-induced apoptosis also increased intracellular ROS level, changed mitochondrial distribution, reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and increased the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Furthermore, western blot analysis revealed a significant increase in p53 and cytochrome c expression, and a decrease in Bcl-2 expression compared to the controls. Moreover, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) showed an increase in the transcript levels of BmICE, Bmapaf-1 and BmEndoG by 439.5%, 423.9% and 42.2%, respectively, after treatment with 1 μM H2O2 for 24 h. However, the transcript levels of Bmbuffy declined by 41.4% after 24 h of exposure to 1 μM H2O2. These results show that H2O2 treatment induced apoptosis in BmN-SWU1 cells via the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Further, it appears that oxidative stress induced by H2O2 activates both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent mitochondrial apoptotic pathways in silkworm cells. Taken together, these findings improve our knowledge of apoptosis in silkworm and the apoptotic pathways in insects."
https://openalex.org/W1833498834,"Decomposers provide an essential ecosystem service that contributes to sustainable production in rice ecosystems by driving the release of nutrients from organic crop residues. During a single rice crop cycle we examined the effects of four different crop residue management practices (rice straw or ash of burned straw scattered on the soil surface or incorporated into the soil) on rice straw decomposition and on the abundance of aquatic and soil-dwelling invertebrates. Mass loss of rice straw in litterbags of two different mesh sizes that either prevented or allowed access of meso- and macro-invertebrates was used as a proxy for decomposition rates. Invertebrates significantly increased total loss of litter mass by up to 30%. Initially, the contribution of invertebrates to decomposition was significantly smaller in plots with rice straw scattered on the soil surface; however, this effect disappeared later in the season. We found no significant responses in microbial decomposition rates to management practices. The abundance of aquatic fauna was higher in fields with rice straw amendment, whereas the abundance of soil fauna fluctuated considerably. There was a clear separation between the overall invertebrate community structure in response to the ash and straw treatments. However, we found no correlation between litter mass loss and abundances of various lineages of invertebrates. Our results indicate that invertebrates can contribute to soil fertility in irrigated paddy fields by decomposing rice straw, and that their abundance as well as efficiency in decomposition may be promoted by crop residue management practices."
https://openalex.org/W1921270052,"Axelrod’s celebrated Prisoner’s Dilemma computer tournaments, published in the early 1980s, were designed to find effective ways of acting in everyday interactions with the strategic properties of the iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma game. The winner of both tournaments was tit-for-tat, a program that cooperates on the first round and then, on every subsequent round, copies the co-player’s choice from the previous round. This has been interpreted as evidence that tit-for-tat is an effective general-purpose strategy. By re-analyzing data from the first tournament and some more recent data, we provide new results suggesting that the efficacy of tit-for-tat is contingent on the design of the tournament, the criterion used to determine success, and the particular values chosen for the Prisoner’s Dilemma payoff matrix. We argue that this places in doubt the generality of the results and the policy implications drawn from them."
https://openalex.org/W2249070556,"Objective We have shown previously that preterm infants are at risk of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), an inflammatory bowel necrosis typically seen in infants born prior to 32 weeks’ gestation, because of the developmental deficiency of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β2 in the intestine. The present study was designed to investigate all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) as an inducer of TGF-β2 in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and to elucidate the involved signaling mechanisms. Methods AtRA effects on intestinal epithelium were investigated using IEC6 cells. TGF-β2 expression was measured using reverse transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blots. Signaling pathways were investigated using Western blots, transiently-transfected/transduced cells, kinase arrays, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and selective small molecule inhibitors. Results AtRA-treatment of IEC6 cells selectively increased TGF-β2 mRNA and protein expression in a time- and dose-dependent fashion, and increased the activity of the TGF-β2 promoter. AtRA effects were mediated via RhoA GTPase, Rho-associated, coiled-coil-containing protein kinase 1 (ROCK1), p38α MAPK, and activating transcription factor (ATF)-2. AtRA increased phospho-ATF2 binding to the TGF-β2 promoter and increased histone H2B acetylation in the TGF-β2 nucleosome, which is typically associated with transcriptional activation. Conclusions AtRA induces TGF-β2 expression in IECs via RhoA- and p38α MAPK-mediated activation of the transcription factor ATF2. Further studies are needed to investigate the role of atRA as a protective/therapeutic agent in gut mucosal inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W1563244776,"Protein S-acyltransferases, also known as palmitoyltransferases (PATs), are characterized by the presence of a 50-amino acid domain called the DHHC domain. Within this domain, these four amino acids constitute a highly conserved motif. It has been proposed that the palmitoylation reaction occurs through a palmitoyl-PAT covalent intermediate that involves the conserved cysteine in the DHHC motif. Mutation of this cysteine results in lack of function for several PATs, and DHHA or DHHS mutants are used regularly as catalytically inactive controls. In a genetic screen to isolate loss-of-function mutations in the yeast PAT Swf1, we isolated an allele encoding a Swf1 DHHR mutant. Overexpression of this mutant is able to partially complement a swf1Δ strain and to acylate the Swf1 substrates Tlg1, Syn8, and Snc1. Overexpression of the palmitoyltransferase Pfa4 DHHA or DHHR mutants also results in palmitoylation of its substrate Chs3. We also investigated the role of the first histidine of the DHHC motif. A Swf1 DQHC mutant is also partially active but a DQHR is not. Finally, we show that Swf1 substrates are differentially modified by both DHHR and DQHC Swf1 mutants. We propose that, in the absence of the canonical mechanism, alternative suboptimal mechanisms take place that are more dependent on the reactivity of the acceptor protein. These results also imply that caution must be exercised when proposing non-canonical roles for PATs on the basis of considering DHHC mutants as catalytically inactive and, more generally, contribute to an understanding of the mechanism of protein palmitoylation"

A review of publications between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2014 from five neuroscience journals (Annals of Neurology, Brain, Lancet Neurology, Neurology, and The Neuroscientist) was performed to identify eligible systematic reviews. The systematic reviews comprising the final sample were independently appraised to determine if clinical trials registries had been included as part of the search process. Studies acknowledging the use of a trials registry were further examined to determine whether trial data had been incorporated into the analysis. The initial search yielded 194 studies, of which 78 systematic reviews met the selection criteria. Of those, five acknowledged the use of a specific clinical trials registry: four reviewed unpublished trial data and two incorporated unpublished trial data into their results. Based on our sample of systematic reviews, there was no increase in the use of trials registries in systematic review searches over time. Few systematic reviews published in clinical neurology journals included data from relevant clinical trials registries."
https://openalex.org/W1496880069,"Antibacterial drugs with novel scaffolds and new mechanisms of action are desperately needed to address the growing problem of antibiotic resistance. The periplasmic oxidative folding system in Gram-negative bacteria represents a possible target for anti-virulence antibacterials. By targeting virulence rather than viability, development of resistance and side effects (through killing host native microbiota) might be minimized. Here, we undertook the design of peptidomimetic inhibitors targeting the interaction between the two key enzymes of oxidative folding, DsbA and DsbB, with the ultimate goal of preventing virulence factor assembly. Structures of DsbB--or peptides--complexed with DsbA revealed key interactions with the DsbA active site cysteine, and with a hydrophobic groove adjacent to the active site. The present work aimed to discover peptidomimetics that target the hydrophobic groove to generate non-covalent DsbA inhibitors. The previously reported structure of a Proteus mirabilis DsbA active site cysteine mutant, in a non-covalent complex with the heptapeptide PWATCDS, was used as an in silico template for virtual screening of a peptidomimetic fragment library. The highest scoring fragment compound and nine derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for DsbA binding and inhibition. These experiments discovered peptidomimetic fragments with inhibitory activity at millimolar concentrations. Although only weakly potent relative to larger covalent peptide inhibitors that interact through the active site cysteine, these fragments offer new opportunities as templates to build non-covalent inhibitors. The results suggest that non-covalent peptidomimetics may need to interact with sites beyond the hydrophobic groove in order to produce potent DsbA inhibitors."

That is, using a well-known approach from operations research, it is possible to derive a strategy that minimizes the expected investment risk, but this strategy does not always result in the best rate of return on assets. Prior to making investment decisions, it is important to an investor to know the potential minimal investment risk (or the expected minimal investment risk) and to determine the strategy that will maximize the return on assets. We use the self-averaging property to analyze the potential minimal investment risk and the concentrated investment level for the strategy that gives the best rate of return. We compare the results from our method with the results obtained by the operations research approach and with those obtained by a numerical simulation using the optimal portfolio. The results of our method and the numerical simulation are in agreement, but they differ from that of the operations research approach."
https://openalex.org/W1928861488,"The perception of pitch is a widely studied and hotly debated topic in human hearing. Many of these studies combine functional imaging techniques with stimuli designed to disambiguate the percept of pitch from frequency information present in the stimulus. While useful in identifying potential ""pitch centres"" in cortex, the existence of truly pitch-responsive neurons requires single neuron-level measures that can only be undertaken in animal models. While a number of animals have been shown to be sensitive to pitch, few studies have addressed the location of cortical generators of pitch percepts in non-human models. The current study uses high-field functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the feline brain in an attempt to identify regions of cortex that show increased activity in response to pitch-evoking stimuli. Cats were presented with iterated rippled noise (IRN) stimuli, narrowband noise stimuli with the same spectral profile but no perceivable pitch, and a processed IRN stimulus in which phase components were randomized to preserve slowly changing modulations in the absence of pitch (IRNo). Pitch-related activity was not observed to occur in either primary auditory cortex (A1) or the anterior auditory field (AAF) which comprise the core auditory cortex in cats. Rather, cortical areas surrounding the posterior ectosylvian sulcus responded preferentially to the IRN stimulus when compared to narrowband noise, with group analyses revealing bilateral activity centred in the posterior auditory field (PAF). This study demonstrates that fMRI is useful for identifying pitch-related processing in cat cortex, and identifies cortical areas that warrant further investigation. Moreover, we have taken the first steps in identifying a useful animal model for the study of pitch perception."

We conducted in-depth interviews with 15 researchers, research ethics committee (REC) chairs and members from 8 different countries with emerging economies, involved in HIV-related research sponsored by HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN), regarding the ethical and regulatory challenges they face in this regard. In the interviews, problems with translating study materials often arose as major concerns. Four sets of challenges were identified concerning linguistic and cultural translations of informed consent documents and other study materials, related to the: (1) context, (2) process, (3) content and (4) translation of these documents. Host country contextual issues included low literacy rates, education (e.g., documents may need to be written below 5th grade reading level), and experiences with research, and different views of written documentation. Certain terms and concepts may not exist in other languages, or have additional connotations that back translations do not always reveal. Challenges arise because of not only the content of word-for-word, literal translation, but the linguistic form of the language, such as tone (e.g., appropriate forms of politeness vs. legalese, seen as harsh), syntax, manner of questions posed, and the concept of the consent); and the contexts of use affect meaning. Problems also emerged in bilateral communications--US IRBs may misunderstand local practices, or communicate insufficiently the reasons for their decisions to foreign RECs. In sum, these data highlight several challenges that have received little, if any, attention in past literature on translation of informed consent and study materials, and have crucial implications for improving practice, education, research and policy, suggesting several strategies, including needs for broader open-source multilingual lexicons, and more awareness of the complexities involved."

However the conservation in eye developmental genetics deeper in the Eumetazoa, and the origin of the conserved gene regulatory apparatus controlling eye development remain unclear due to limited comparative developmental data from Cnidaria. Here we show in the eye-bearing scyphozoan cnidarian Aurelia that the ectodermal photosensory domain of the developing medusa sensory structure known as the rhopalium expresses sine oculis (so)/six1/2 and eyes absent/eya, but not optix/six3/6 or pax (A&B). In addition, the so and eya co-expression domain encompasses the region of active cell proliferation, neurogenesis, and mechanoreceptor development in rhopalia. Consistent with the role of so and eya in rhopalial development, developmental transcriptome data across Aurelia life cycle stages show upregulation of so and eya, but not optix or pax (A&B), during medusa formation. Moreover, pax6 and dach are absent in the Aurelia genome, and thus are not required for eye development in Aurelia. Our data are consistent with so and eya, but not optix, pax or dach, having conserved functions in sensory structure specification across Eumetazoa. The lability of developmental components including Pax genes relative to so-eya is consistent with a model of sense organ development and evolution that involved the lineage specific modification of a combinatorial code that specifies animal sense organs."

ATPase and endonuclease mutants of MutLα are defective in the flap removal. These results suggest that the MMR system contributes to the removal of 1-nucleotide Okazaki fragment flaps."

The aim of this study was to elucidate achievement rates and examine healthy lifestyle characteristics associated with achievement status among Japanese.This cross-sectional study, conducted in January-December 2012, examined blood pressure control and healthy lifestyle characteristics in 8,001 Japanese workers with hypertension (mean age, 57.0 years; 78.8% were men) who participated in a workplace health checkup. Data were collected from workplace medical checkup records and participants' self-administered questionnaires. We divided into 5 groups [G1; young, middle-aged, and early-phase elderly patients (65-74 years old) without diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease (CKD) (<140/90 mmHg), G2; late-phase elderly patients (≥75 years old) without diabetes mellitus or CKD (<150/90 mmHg), G3; diabetic patients (<130/80 mmHg), G4; patients with CKD (<130/80 mmHg), and G5; patients with cerebrovascular and/or coronary artery diseases (<140/90 mmHg)] according to JSH2014. And then, achievement rates were calculated in each group. Multivariate analysis identified healthy lifestyle characteristics associated with ""therapeutic failure"" of target blood pressure.Target blood pressures were achieved by 60.2% of young, middle-aged, and early-phase elderly patients (G1), 71.4% of late-phase elderly patients (G2), 30.5% of diabetic patients (G3), 33.4% of those with chronic kidney disease (G4), and 66.0% of those with cerebrovascular and/or coronary artery diseases (G5). A body mass index of 18.5-24.9 and non-daily alcohol consumption were protective factors, and adequate sleep was found to contribute to therapeutic success.We found low achievement rates for treatment goals among patients with chronic kidney disease and diabetes mellitus. Maintaining an ideal body weight and adequate alcohol consumption may help with blood pressure control. Lifestyle modification may be necessary for better management of hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W1746598994,"Early studies demonstrated the involvement of ubiquitination of the Notch intracellular domain for rapid turnover of the transcriptional complex at Notch target genes. It was shown that this ubiquitination was promoted by the co-activator Mastermind like 1 (MAML1). MAML1 also contains numerous lysine residues that may also be ubiquitinated and necessary for protein regulation. In this study, we show that over-expressed MAML1 is ubiquitinated and identify eight conserved lysine residues which are required for ubiquitination. We also show that p300 stimulates ubiquitination and that Notch inhibits ubiquitination. Furthermore, we show that a mutant MAML1 that has decreased ubiquitination shows increased output from a HES1 reporter gene assay. Therefore, we speculate that ubiquitination of MAML1 might be a mechanism to maintain low levels of the protein until needed for transcriptional activation. In summary, this study identifies that MAML1 is ubiquitinated in the absence of Notch signaling to maintain low levels of MAML1 in the cell. Our data supports the notion that a precise and tight regulation of the Notch pathway is required for this signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1829094064,"The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa can grow under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Its flexibility with respect to oxygen load is reflected by the fact that its genome encodes all three existing classes of ribonucleotides reductase (RNR): the oxygen-dependent class I RNR, the oxygen-indifferent class II RNR, and the oxygen-sensitive class III RNR. The P. aeruginosa class II RNR is expressed as two separate polypeptides (NrdJa and NrdJb), a unique example of a split RNR enzyme in a free-living organism. A split class II RNR is also found in a few closely related γ-Proteobacteria. We have characterized the P. aeruginosa class II RNR and show that both subunits are required for formation of a biologically functional enzyme that can sustain vitamin B12-dependent growth. Binding of the B12 coenzyme as well as substrate and allosteric effectors resides in the NrdJa subunit, whereas the NrdJb subunit mediates efficient reductive dithiol exchange during catalysis. A combination of activity assays and activity-independent methods like surface plasmon resonance and gas phase electrophoretic macromolecule analysis suggests that the enzymatically active form of the enzyme is a (NrdJa-NrdJb)2 homodimer of heterodimers, and a combination of hydrogen-deuterium exchange experiments and molecular modeling suggests a plausible region in NrdJa that interacts with NrdJb. Our detailed characterization of the split NrdJ from P. aeruginosa provides insight into the biochemical function of a unique enzyme known to have central roles in biofilm formation and anaerobic growth."
https://openalex.org/W1899329298,"Monitoring the DNA-Damage Response (DDR) activated pathway in multicellular tumor spheroid models is an important challenge as these 3D models have demonstrated their major relevance in pharmacological evaluation. Herein we present DDR-Act-FP, a fluorescent biosensor that allows detection of DDR activation through monitoring of the p21 promoter p53-dependent activation. We show that cells expressing the DDR-Act-FP biosensor efficiently report activation of the DDR pathway after DNA damage and its pharmacological manipulation using ATM kinase inhibitors. We also report the successful use of this assay to screen a small compound library in order to identify activators of the DDR response. Finally, using multicellular spheroids expressing the DDR-Act-FP we demonstrate that DDR activation and its pharmacological manipulation with inhibitory and activatory compounds can be efficiently monitored in live 3D spheroid model.

https://openalex.org/W2160377517,"Evolution of enzymes plays a crucial role in obtaining new biological functions for all life forms. Arsenate reductases (ArsC) are several families of arsenic detoxification enzymes that reduce arsenate to arsenite, which can subsequently be extruded from cells by specific transporters. Among these, the Synechocystis ArsC (SynArsC) is structurally homologous to the well characterized thioredoxin (Trx)-coupled ArsC family but requires the glutaredoxin (Grx) system for its reactivation, therefore classified as a unique Trx/Grx-hybrid family. The detailed catalytic mechanism of SynArsC is unclear and how the “hybrid” mechanism evolved remains enigmatic. Herein, we report the molecular mechanism of SynArsC by biochemical and structural studies. Our work demonstrates that arsenate reduction is carried out via an intramolecular thiol-disulfide cascade similar to the Trx-coupled family, whereas the enzyme reactivation step is diverted to the coupling of the glutathione-Grx pathway due to the local structural difference. The current results support the hypothesis that SynArsC is likely a molecular fossil representing an intermediate stage during the evolution of the Trx-coupled ArsC family from the low molecular weight protein phosphotyrosine phosphatase (LMW-PTPase) family.

The exact role of GSH/Grx in arsenate reduction by SynArsC, as well as the molecular mechanism of why SynArsC shows selectivity of Grx over Trx system, remains unclear. As a “hybrid” arsenate reductase, SynArsC probably represent an intermediate stage during evolution of arsenate reductases (1Messens J. Silver S.

Elucidation of its enzymatic mechanism would provide intriguing insights for understanding the evolutionary relationship between arsenate reductase and PTPase families. Herein we present a structure-based mechanism of SynArsC by using a combination of biochemical and biophysics methods, with four SynArsC structures representing different reaction stages during arsenate reduction determined. Our results clearly establish a hybrid mechanism that can be divided into two stages: the arsenate reduction stage and the enzyme reactivation stage. SynArsC alone is required in the arsenate reduction stage, utilizing a thiol-disulfide cascade mechanism essentially similar to the Trx-coupled ArsC family (5Zegers I. Martins J.C. Willem R. Wyns L.

Nevertheless, the oxidation of SynArsC results in a “loop to helix” transition at the active site, which is exactly the opposite of the “helix to loop” transition as observed in the Trx-coupled ArsC family (5Zegers I.

The different local conformation is incompatible with Trx interaction, and requires the GSH-Grx system as the upstream reductant. Our current results provide the structural insights for understanding the hybrid mechanism of SynArsC, and favor the hypothesis that SynArsC may represent an earlier stage during the enzyme evolution from LMW-PTPase to arsenate reductase. The slr0946 gene encoding SynArsC was cloned into the pET-28a(+) vector (Novagen) with or without the N-terminal His tag, and the resulting plasmid was used as templates in PCR amplification with primers designed to generate the C8S, C13S, C35S, C80S, C82S, C13S/C35S, C13S/C35S/C82S, and C8S/C13S/C35S mutants. Similar to as previously reported (18Yu C. Xia B. Jin C. 1H, 13C and 15N resonance assignments of the arsenate reductase from Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803.Biomol. NMR Assign. 2011; 5: 85-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), the plasmids were transformed into the E. coli BL21(DE3) strain (Novagen) for expression. The culture was first grown in 1 liter of Luria-Bertani medium at 35 °C with 50 mg/liter of kanamycin. When the A600 reached 0.8, the cells were collected by centrifugation at 4,000 × g and resuspended in 500 ml of M9 minimal medium (with kanamycin) with NH4Cl and glucose as the nitrogen and carbon sources. After shaking for 1 h at 35 °C, protein expression was induced by adding isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside to a final concentration of 0.4 mm. After 8 h induction, the cells were centrifuged at 7,000 × g at 4 °C, resuspended in 30 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.5), and frozen at −80 °C. For preparation of 13C/15N-labeled or 15N-labled proteins, 15NH4Cl and [13C6]glucose or 15NH4Cl only were used in the M9 media. The proteins were initially purified either using anion-exchange chromatography (Q-Sepharose fast flow column, GE Healthcare) eluted with a 0–0.5 m NaCl gradient for constructs without the N-terminal His tag, or nickel-affinity chromatography (nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column, Qiagen) for constructs with the N-terminal His tag. The N-terminal His tag was removed by thrombin (Sigma) incubation overnight at room temperature. A subsequent gel-filtration chromatography (Superdex-75) using an ÄKTA FPLC system (GE Healthcare) was further used to obtain protein samples with >90% purity as judged by SDS-PAGE. The samples prepared with or without His tags exhibit similar catalytic activities as well as NMR spectral properties. The sample of the Cys8-Cys80 disulfide-bridged SynArsC intermediate (int-SynArsC) was prepared using the C13S/C35S/C82S triple mutant. The protein was first purified in the presence of dithiothreitol (DTT) to ensure a fully reduced state. The DTT was subsequently removed by gel filtration, and the SynArsC C13S/C35S/C82S sample was mixed with arsenate at a molar ratio of 1:5 and incubated for 5 min at room temperature followed by a second gel filtration chromatography. Formation of the Cys8-Cys80 disulfide bridge was verified by Ellman's test of free thiols using 5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid as the reagent (19Ellman G.L. Tissue sulfhydryl groups.Arch.

Wild-type or mutant SynArsC (1 μm) was incubated with an equal molar of arsenate in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0) with 50 mm NaCl for 30 min at room temperature before loading onto the HPLC column (Hamilton PRP X100) for separation of arsenic species by anion exchange chromatography. The eluents containing 20 mm K2HPO4-KH2PO4 (pH 5.9) were pumped at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, and mixed with NaBH4 solution to generate volatile arsine, which was subsequently purged by an argon flux to be detected by atomic fluorescence spectrometry. The experiments were performed using the AF-610D2 chromatography-atomic fluorescence spectrometry instrument system (Beijing Rayleigh Analytical Instrument Corp., China). Mass spectrometry analyses of the molecular weights of SynArsC-C13S/C35S/C82S and C8S/C13S/C35S mutants in both reduced and oxidized states were performed using a high-resolution electrospray ionization-Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance (ESI-FT-ICR) mass spectrometer (APEX Qe, Bruker Daltonics) equipped with a 9.4 tesla actively shielded magnet. For a straightforward interpretation, the obtained positive ion mass spectra were charge-deconvoluted (20Medzihradszky K.F. Zhang X. Chalkley R.J. Guan S. McFarland M.A. Chalmers M.J. Marshall A.G. Diaz R.L. Allis C.D. Burlingame A.L.

For determination of disulfide bonds, protein samples were subjected to digestion using a combination of multiple proteases trypsin, Asp-N and Glu-C (Promega). The resulting peptides were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) as described previously (21Hu M. Liu Y. Yu K. Liu X. Decreasing the amount of trypsin in in-gel digestion leads to diminished chemical noise and improved protein identifications.J. Proteomics. 2014; 109: 16-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, nanoflow reversed-phase LC separation was carried out on an EASY-nLC 1000 System (Thermo Scientific). Peptides eluted from the capillary column were electrosprayed directly onto a linear ion trap mass spectrometer (LTQ Velos, Thermo Scientific) for MS and MS/MS analyses. NMR experiments were carried out at 25 °C on Bruker Avance 500-, 600-, and 800-MHz spectrometers equipped with triple-resonance cryoprobes. Spectra for chemical shift assignments have been reported previously (18Yu C. Xia B. Jin C. 1H, 13C and 15N resonance assignments of the arsenate reductase from Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803.Biomol. NMR Assign. 2011; 5: 85-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), and three-dimensional 15N- and 13C-edited nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY)-heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra (mixing time 100 ms) were collected to confirm the assignments and generate inter-proton distance constraints for structure calculation. The backbone amide residual dipolar couplings were also measured for the Pi-SynArsC sample by using the pentaethylene glycol dodecyl ether (C12E5) and n-hexane liquid crystal as the alignment medium (25Ruckert M. Otting G. Alignment of biological macromolecules in novel nonionic liquid crystalline media for NMR experiments.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 7793-7797Crossref Scopus (540) Google Scholar), and by calculating the splitting differences using the 1H-15N in-phase-anti-phase HSQC experiment isotropic and weakly aligned samples (26Ottiger M. Delaglio F. Bax A. Measurement of J and dipolar couplings from simplified two-dimensional NMR spectra.J. Magn. Reson. 1998; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). The structures of SynArsC in different states were calculated by CYANA and refined by AMBER (27Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K.

Inter-proton distance restraints were generated from nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) in the NOESY-HSQC spectra. Dihedral angles ϕ and ψ constraints were determined from backbone chemical shifts using TALOS (30Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. Protein backbone angle restraints from searching a database for chemical shift and sequence homology.J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar). Hydrogen bond restraints were obtained from hydrogen-deuterium exchange experiments in combination with the NOE pattern and secondary structural information. For Pi-SynArsC, backbone amide residual dipolar coupling restraints were also used. The CANDID module of the CYANA program was used to generate the initial structures (28Herrmann T. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. Protein NMR structure determination with automated NOE assignment using the new software CANDID and the torsion angle dynamics algorithm DYANA.J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 209-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1328) Google Scholar). The 20 structures with the lowest target functions were selected as models for SANE to extend the NOE assignments (31Duggan B.M. Legge G.B. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. SANE (Structure Assisted NOE Evaluation): an automated model-based approach for NOE assignment.J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 19: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). 200 structures were calculated using CYANA interactively and 100 structures with the lowest target functions were selected for further refinement by AMBER. Finally, the 20 lowest-energy conformers were selected to represent the solution structure of SynArsC in different states. SynArsC contains a total of five cysteine residues, Cys8, Cys13, Cys35, Cys80, and Cys82, among which only the Cys8, Cys80, and Cys82 residues were identified essential for arsenate reduction activity (15Li R. Haile J.D. Kennelly P.J. An arsenate reductase from Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 exhibits a novel combination of catalytic characteristics.J.

Sequence alignment with the Trx-coupled S. aureus and B. subtilis ArsC shows that the first and second cysteines (Cys8/Cys80 of SynArsC and Cys10/Cys82 of S. aureus and B. subtilis ArsC) are conserved, whereas the third cysteine (Cys82 of SynArsC and Cys89 of S. aureus and B. subtilis ArsC) is positioned differently (Fig. 1A). As depicted in Fig. 1, B and C, one of the most significant differences between the Trx- and Grx-coupled arsenate reductases is"

Methods We used data from a cohort of HIV seroconverters to investigate the effect of HCV infection duration on time from HIV seroconversion to CD4 <350cells/mm3, AIDS or death, censoring at the earlier of cART initiation or last clinic visit, adjusting for confounders and splitting data into follow up periods from HIV seroconversion (<2, 2–4 and >4 years). We additionally compared CD4 cell decline following HCV infection to that of mono-infected individuals with similar HIV infection duration by fitting a random effects model. In a separate analysis, we used linear mixed models to we examine the effect of HCV infection and its duration on CD4 increase over 48 weeks following cART. Results Of 1655 individuals, 97 (5.9%) were HCV co-infected. HCV<1 year was associated with a higher risk of endpoint in each follow-up period from HIV seroconversion (HR [95% CI] 2.58 [1.51, 4.41], p = 0.001; 3.80 [1.20, 12.03], p = 0.023; 2.03 [0.88, 4.71], p = 0.098 for <2, 2–4 and >4 years respectively), compared to mono-infected individuals. However, we found no evidence of an association for those with HCV>2 years (all p>0.89). Individuals experienced a somewhat greater decrease in CD4 count following HCV infection lasting 13 months, relative to individuals with HIV alone, (estimate = -3.33, 95% CI [-7.29, 0.63] cells/mm3 per month, p = 0.099). Of 1502 initiating cART, 106 (7.1%) were HCV co-infected, with no evidence of HCV duration at cART being associated with immunological response (p = 0.45). Conclusions The impact of HCV co-infection on HIV disease progression appears to be restricted to the first year after HCV infection."
