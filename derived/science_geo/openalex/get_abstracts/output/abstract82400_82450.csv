https://openalex.org/W1562376535,"A murine monoclonal antibody, designated AP-2, reacts specifically with the complex formed by human platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb and IIIa, but does not react at all with the individual glycoproteins. Purified AP-2 covalently coupled to Sepharose CL4B was used as an immunoadsorbent column to purify the IIb-IIIa complex from a preparation of Triton X-100-solubilized human platelet proteins. Radioiodinated AP-2 was shown to bind to a single class of sites, with 57,400 +/- 9,700 molecules bound per cell (mean +/- S.D.) at saturation and a dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.64 +/- 0.15 nM (mean +/- S.D.). Binding could not be readily reversed even after a 1-h incubation with a 100-fold excess of cold antibody. AP-2 inhibits ADP-induced binding of radiolabeled fibrinogen to gel-filtered platelets in a noncompetitive fashion, consistent with the previous observation that AP-2 also inhibits the aggregation of platelets in plasma induced by a number of physiologic agonists, including adenosine diphosphate, epinephrine, collagen, thrombin, and arachidonic acid. Using AP-2, we have obtained evidence that the IIb-IIIa complex exists in the membrane of intact nonstimulated platelets and that complex integrity is not affected by external calcium ion concentration."
https://openalex.org/W1850997011,"Abstract Phosphorylation of purified phospholamban isolated from canine cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles decreased the electrophoretic mobility of the protein in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels. Different mobility forms of phospholamban in SDS gels were visualized both by direct protein staining and by autoradiography. Unphosphorylated phospholamban migrated with an apparent Mr = 25,000 in SDS gels; maximal phosphorylation of phospholamban by cAMP- or Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase increased the apparent Mr to 27,000. Partial phosphorylation of phospholamban by either protein kinase gave intermediate mobility forms of molecular weights between 25,000 and 27,000, suggesting that more than one phosphorylation site was present on the holoprotein for each activity. Boiling of phospholamban in SDS dissociated the holoprotein into an apparently homogeneous class of low molecular weight monomers. Only two mobility forms of monomeric phospholamban were observed in SDS gels after phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase, corresponding to 9-kDa dephospho- and 11-kDa phosphoproteins. All of the 9-kDa protein could be phosphorylated and converted into the 11-kDa mobility form, suggesting the presence of only one site of phosphorylation on a single type of monomer for cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Simultaneous phosphorylation of monomeric phospholamban by cAMP-dependent protein kinase and Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase gave an additional mobility form of the protein, suggesting that different sites of phosphorylation were present for each activity on each monomer. Incomplete dissociation of the holoprotein by boiling it in a relatively low concentration of SDS facilitated the detection of five major mobility forms of the protein in SDS gels, and the mobilities of all of these forms were decreased by phosphorylation. We propose that the high molecular weight form of phospholamban is a multimer of electrophoretically indistinguishable monomers, each of which contains a different phosphorylation site for cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity and Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase activity. Phosphorylation of phospholamban at multiple sites is responsible for the various mobility forms of the holoprotein detected in SDS-polyacrylamide gels."
https://openalex.org/W1990429873,"A soluble HeLa cell extract accurately polyadenylates RNA transcribed from DNA templates containing the adenovirus L3 polyadenylation site. Regardless of the length of these DNA templates, the major polyadenylated species had 3â€² termini corresponding to the in vivo site. Polyadenylated RNA appears after an hour lag and only reaches maximum levels after 4 hr of incubation, a time course similar to that of splicing in this extract. Inhibitor studies suggest that the polyadenylation reaction is not coupled to active transcription. Unlike splicing in this extract where exogenous substrate is processed, addition of purified RNA precursor to the reaction does not yield product polyadenylated at L3 but rather results in addition of poly (A) to termini of the precursor. This suggests that part of the specificity of polyadenylation is established by in situ synthesis of RNA. Surprisingly, synthesis of accurately polyadenylated RNA may involve small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs). The reaction is inhibited by antisera of Sm and Ul RNP specificities as well as antiserum to the nuclear antigen La, but is not inhibited by control serum and anti-(U2)RNP serum."
https://openalex.org/W1539275723,"A group of proteins that bind to the chromaffin granule membrane in the presence of Ca2+ has been isolated by affinity chromatography of bovine adrenal medullary cytosol on granule membranes coupled to Sepharose 4B. Twenty-two of these proteins were resolved into classes depending upon the Ca2+ concentration at which they were eluted from the affinity column (40 or 0.1 microM), upon their affinities for native granule membranes or for liposomes prepared from extracted granule lipids, and upon the requirement of seven of the proteins for ATP in the cytosol fraction and column buffers to promote binding. The molecular weights and isoelectric points of these proteins were determined by two-dimensional electrophoresis. Two of the granule-binding proteins were identified: synexin and calmodulin. Calmodulin was found to bind to seven specific granule membrane proteins after diffusion of 125I-labeled calmodulin into an acrylamide gel of membrane proteins separated by electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. A phospholipid-activated protein kinase activity, possibly due to protein kinase C, was present in the granule-binding fraction. Two major granule-binding proteins were found to present a pattern in two-dimensional electrophoresis that was very similar to but shifted slightly toward the basic end of the gel from the pattern generated by light chains associated with clathrin in adrenal medullary coated vesicles. In the chromaffin cell, these proteins, by associating with the granule membrane in the presence of an increased cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, might play a variety of roles in the process of exocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1503799141,"Abstract A thermodynamic cycle for catalysis of calcium transport by the sarcoplasmic reticulum ATPase is described, based on equilibrium constants for the microscopic steps of the reaction shown in Equation 1 under a single set of experimental (formula; see text) conditions (pH 7.0, 25 degrees C, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgSO4): = 5.9 X 10(-12) M2, K alpha ATP = 15 microM, Kint = 0.47, K alpha ADP = 0.73 mM, K'int = 1.7, KCa = 2.2 X 10(-6) M2, and Kp = 37 mM. The value of KCa was calculated by difference, from the free energy of hydrolysis of ATP. The spontaneous formation of an acylphosphate from Pi and E is made possible by the expression of 12.5 kcal mol-1 of noncovalent binding energy in E-P. Only 1.9 kcal mol-1 of binding energy is expressed in E X Pi. There is a mutual destabilization of bound phosphate and calcium in E-P X Ca2, with delta GD = 7.6 kcal mol-1, that permits transfer of phosphate to ADP and transfer of calcium to a concentrated calcium pool inside the vesicle. It is suggested that the ordered kinetic mechanism for the dissociation of E-P X Ca2, with phosphate transfer to ADP before calcium dissociation outside and phosphate transfer to water after calcium dissociation inside, preserves the Gibbs energies of these ligands and makes a major contribution to the coupling in the transport process. A lag (approximately 5 ms) before the appearance of E-P after mixing E and Pi at pH 6 is diminished by ATP and by increased [Pi]. This suggests that ATP accelerates the binding of Pi. The weak inhibition by ATP of E-P formation at equilibrium also suggests that ATP and phosphate can bind simultaneously to the enzyme at pH 6. Rate constants are greater than or equal to 115 s-1 for all the steps in the reaction sequence to form E-32P X Ca2 from E-P, Ca2+ and [32P]ATP at pH 7. E-P X Ca2 decomposes with kappa = 17 s-1, which shows that it is a kinetically competent intermediate. The value of kappa decreases to 4 s-1 if the intermediate is formed in the presence of 2 mM Ca2+. This decrease and inhibition of turnover by greater than 0.1 mM Ca2+ may result from slow decomposition of E-P X Ca3."
https://openalex.org/W1535387945,"The effects of inhibiting histone deacetylation on the maturation of newly replicated chromatin have been examined. HeLa cells were labeled with [3H]thymidine in the presence or absence of sodium butyrate; control experiments demonstrated that butyrate did not significantly inhibit DNA replication for at least 70 min. Like normal nascent chromatin, chromatin labeled for brief periods (0.5-1 min) in the presence of butyrate was more sensitive to digestion with DNase I and micrococcal nuclease than control bulk chromatin. However, chromatin replicated in butyrate did not mature as in normal replication, but instead retained approximately 50% of its heightened sensitivity to DNase I. Incubation of mature chromatin in butyrate for 1 h did not induce DNase I sensitivity: therefore, the presence of sodium butyrate was required during replication to preserve the increased digestibility of nascent chromatin DNA. In contrast, sodium butyrate did not inhibit or retard the maturation of newly replicated chromatin when assayed by micrococcal nuclease digestion, as determined by the following criteria: 1) digestion to acid solubility, 2) rate of conversion to mononucleosomes, 3) repeat length, and 4) presence of non-nucleosomal DNA. Consistent with the properties of chromatin replicated in butyrate, micrococcal nuclease also did not preferentially attack the internucleosomal linkers of chromatin regions acetylated in vivo. The observation of a novel chromatin replication intermediate, which is highly sensitive to DNase I but possesses normal resistance to micrococcal nuclease, suggests that nucleosome assembly and histone deacetylation are not obligatorily coordinated. Thus, while deacetylation is required for chromatin maturation, histone acetylation apparently affects chromatin organization at a level distinct from that of core particle or linker, possibly by altering higher order structure."
https://openalex.org/W1489733505,"1-Deoxynojirimycin was found to inhibit oligosaccharide processing of rat alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor. In normal hepatocytes alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor was present in the cells as a 49,000 Mr high mannose type glycoprotein with oligosaccharide side chains having the composition Man9GlcNAc and Man8GlcNAc with the former in a higher proportion. Hepatocytes treated with 5 mM 1-deoxynojirimycin accumulated alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor as a 51,000 Mr glycoprotein with carbohydrate side chains of the high mannose type, containing glucose as measured by their sensitivity against alpha-glucosidase, the largest species being Glc3Man9GlcNAc. Conversion to complex oligosaccharides was inhibited by the drug. In addition, increasing concentrations of 1-deoxynojirimycin inhibited glycosylation resulting in the formation of some alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor with two instead of three oligosaccharide side chains. 5 mM 1-deoxynojirimycin inhibited the secretion of alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor by about 50%, whereas secretion of albumin was unaffected. The oligosaccharides of alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor secreted from 1-deoxynojirimycin-treated cells were characterized by their susceptibility to endoglucosaminidase H, incorporation of [3H]galactose, and [3H]fucose and concanavalin A-Sepharose chromatography. It was found that 1-deoxynojirimycin did not completely block oligosaccharide processing, resulting in the formation of alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor molecules carrying one or two complex type oligosaccharides. Only these alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor molecules processed to the complex type in one or two of their oligosaccharide chains were nearly exclusively secreted. This finding demonstrates the importance of oligosaccharide processing for the secretion of alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W1661415166,"Lysosomal enzymes of the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum contain mannose 6-phosphate and bind with high affinity to the phosphomannosyl receptor of human fibroblasts. In this study, we have partially characterized the Asn-linked oligosaccharide units present on these enzymes. [3H]Mannose-labeled alpha-D-mannosidase, beta-D-glucosidase, and beta-D-N-acetylglucosaminidase were purified from the spent growth medium of strain AX3 and glycopeptides were prepared by pronase digestion. Approximately 75% of the glycopeptides contained sulfate residues. These could be removed by solvolysis without degrading the underlying oligosaccharide. Following solvolysis (but not before), the oligosaccharides could be released by endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H, indicating the presence of high mannose-type units. Greater than 85% of the oligosaccharides contained one or two mannose 6-phosphate residues in the form of an unusual acid-stable phosphodiester. About 3% of the oligosaccharides contained phosphomonoesters and only 6% were neutral species. The major neutral oligosaccharide eluted in the position of Man9GlcNAc when analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography whereas the minor species appeared to be 1-2 residues larger. Acetolysis of the major phosphorylated fractions revealed that molecules with a single mannose 6-phosphate contained the phosphomannosyl residue on the branch linked alpha 1,6 to the beta-linked mannose whereas molecules with two phosphomannosyl residues had the residues on this branch as well as the branch linked alpha 1,3 to the beta-linked mannose. The mechanism of mannose phosphorylation in the slime mold must differ from that of mammalian cells since the phosphomannosyl residues are present as acid-resistant phosphodiesters rather than acid-labile phosphodiesters."
https://openalex.org/W1538566986,"The F1F0 H+-ATPase in membranes of Escherichia coli was amplified by heat induction of a lysogenic lambda-unc+ transducing phage. Inverted membrane vesicles were stripped of the F1 sector of the ATPase complex by washing with EDTA. The stripped membranes were treated with dithiobis(succimidylpropionate) to cross-link subunits of the F0 sector of the ATPase complex. After electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions in one dimension, cross-linked subunits were identified by off-diagonal electrophoresis in a second dimension following cleavage of the cross-linked products with beta-mercaptoethanol. A psi-psi dimer was the major cross-linked product identified. In addition, a chi-psi product and chi-psi2 product were identified. These results support the proposed chi-psi2 stoichiometry of subunits in F0. When the F1-stripped membranes were treated with trypsin, the psi subunit was rapidly degraded, whereas psi was protected from degradation when F1 was bound to the membrane. Trypsin-treated, stripped membranes, lacking an intact psi subunit, did not bind the F1 portion of the ATPase with high affinity. However, these trypsin-treated stripped membranes remained as permeable to protons as untreated stripped membranes, and the H+ conductivity was blocked by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. These results indicate that the portion of the psi subunit exposed on the cytoplasmic face of the inner membrane is involved in the binding of the F1 portion of the ATPase, but is not necessary for H+ conduction mediated by the F0 sector of the complex."
https://openalex.org/W2149269310,"We have identified nuclear mutants of Neurospora that are defective in splicing the mitochondrial large rRNA and that accumulate unspliced pre-rRNA (35S RNA). In cyt-4 mutants, the unspliced pre-rRNA contains short 3' end extensions (110 nucleotides) that are not present in pre-rRNAs from the other mutants. This and other characteristics suggest that the cyt-4 mutants may be primarily defective in 3' end synthesis and the RNA splicing defect occurs secondarily as a result of impaired RNA folding. The cyt-4 mutants also accumulate a ""short"" intron RNA and small exon RNAs that may reflect aberrant RNA cleavages. The 5' end of the short intron is about 285 nucleotides downstream from the 5' splice site at or near the base of the ""central hairpin"", a putative intermediate in folding of the pre-rRNA. Furthermore, the aberrant cleavage sites are immediately after a six nucleotide sequence (GAUAAU) homologous to the final splice junction (GAU/AAC)."
https://openalex.org/W1535988227,"Polypeptides of Mr = 190,000-220,000 that cross-react with erythrocyte ankyrin were detected in immunoblots of membranes from pig lens, pig brain, and rat liver. The cross-reacting polypeptides from brain were cleaved by chymotrypsin to fragments of Mr = 95,000 and 72,000 which are the same size as fragments obtained with erythrocyte ankyrin. The brain 72,000 Mr fragment associated with erythrocyte spectrin, and the binding occurred at the same site as that of erythrocyte ankyrin 72,000 Mr fragment since (a) brain 72,000 Mr fragment was adsorbed to erythrocyte spectrin-agarose and (b) 125I-labeled erythrocyte spectrin bound to brain 72,000 Mr fragment following transfer of the fragment from a sodium dodecyl sulfate gel to nitrocellulose paper, and this binding was displaced by erythrocyte ankyrin 72,000 Mr fragment. Brain 72,000 Mr fragment was purified about 400-fold by selective extraction and by continuous chromatography on columns attached in series containing DEAE-cellulose followed by erythrocyte spectrin coupled to agarose, and finally hydroxylapatite. The brain 72,000 Mr fragment was not derived from contaminating erythrocytes since peptide maps of pig brain and pig erythrocyte 72,000 Mr fragments were distinct. The amount of brain 72,000 Mr fragment was estimated as 0.28% of membrane protein or 39 pmol/mg based on radioimmunoassay with 125I-labeled brain fragment and antibody against erythrocyte ankyrin. Brain spectrin tetramer was present in about the same number of copies (30 pmol/mg of membrane protein) based on densitometry of Coomassie blue-stained sodium dodecyl sulfate gels. The binding site on brain spectrin for both brain and erythrocyte ankyrin 72,000 Mr fragments was localized by electron microscopy to the midregion of spectrin tetramers about 90 nM from the near end and 110 nM from the far end. These studies demonstrate the presence in brain membranes of a protein closely related to erythrocyte ankyrin, and are consistent with a function of the brain ankyrin as a membrane attachment site for brain spectrin."
https://openalex.org/W1501793516,"That stable transcription complexes are formed in HeLa cell RNA polymerase III transcription extracts (Weil, P. A., Segall, J., Harris, B., Ng, S.-Y., and Roeder, R. G. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 6163-6173) can be shown in order of template addition experiments with DNAs coding for adenovirus 2 VA I RNA or one of the Bombyx mori tRNAAla2 genes. Using this property of the HeLa extracts in a second template rescue assay has allowed us to partially purify protein components involved in stable transcription complex formation. Two fractions, called transcription fraction X (TfrX) and transcription fraction Y (TfrY), are required to fully reconstitute selective transcription of the VA I and tRNAAla2 DNA templates. TfrX contains one or more components required for forming transcriptional pre-emptive complexes, as shown in order of addition experiments. TfrX strongly protects a DNA segment surrounding the highly conserved distal sequence (the so-called B block) of the VA I and tRNAAla2 genes from DNase I digestion; we have also characterized weak protection of other segments of these genes by TfrX. DNase I protection experiments with TfrX and probes prepared from deletion variants of the VA I gene show that an intact B block is required for the strong protection."
https://openalex.org/W1554364726,"Anti-La sera from patients with autoimmune disorders precipitate a set of nuclear and cytoplasmic small RNA-protein complexes. Up to now, it has been thought that the La antigen is associated only with RNAs transcribed by RNA polymerase III, including precursors of tRNA and 5 S ribosomal RNA. Here we report that anti-La sera also react with ribonucleoprotein particles containing small nuclear RNA U1, which is transcribed by RNA polymerase II. Anti-La sera from 12 out of 12 patients tested were found to precipitate U1 RNA-protein complexes from HeLa cell nuclear extracts, under conditions where nonimmune sera do not. Ribonucleoprotein particles containing a second small nuclear RNA, U2, do not react appreciably with anti-La sera although they are present in HeLa cell nuclei at the same concentration as U1 RNA. Anti-La sera also react with U1 RNA-protein complexes in mouse and frog cells, but not in Drosophila or Chironomus, two organisms which lack the La antigen. Hybridization of cloned U1 DNA with anti-La-reactive RNA from HeLa cell nuclear extracts reveals mature U1 RNA, whereas anti-La-reactive cytoplasmic RNA contains a series of hybridizing bands that represent molecules 1-7 nucleotides longer than U1 and which may include precursors of nuclear U1 RNA (Madore, S. J., Wieben, E. D., and Pederson, T. (1984) J. Cell Biol., 188-192). Pulse-chase experiments suggest that the association of La antigenicity with these cytoplasmic U1 RNA molecules is transient. These results are discussed in relation to the presence of uridylate-rich sequences in the 3' termini of U1 RNA precursors and mature U1 RNA, which are similar to La antigen binding sites in several RNAs transcribed by RNA polymerase III."
https://openalex.org/W1530579275,"Cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum contains an endogenous calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase and a 22,000-Da substrate, phospholamban. This kinase is half-maximally activated (EC50) by 3.8 +/- 0.3 microM calcium and is absolutely dependent on exogenous calmodulin (EC50 = 49 nM). To determine the effect of this phosphorylation on calcium transport, sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles (0.5 mg/ml) were preincubated under conditions for optimal phosphorylation (50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.478 mM CACl2, 0.1 microM calmodulin, 0.5 mM ATP). Control sarcoplasmic reticulum was preincubated under identical conditions but in the absence of ATP to avoid phosphorylation. Both control and phosphorylated vesicles were centrifuged and resuspended in 0.3 M sucrose, 20 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM KCl, pH 7.0, to remove calmodulin and subsequently assayed for calcium (45Ca) transport in the presence of 2.5 mM Tris-oxalate. Phosphorylation of sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles by calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase resulted in a significant increase (2- to 4-fold) in the rate of calcium transport at low calcium concentrations (less than 3 microM), while calcium transport was minimally affected at higher calcium. Hill coefficients (n) derived from Hill plots of transport data showed no difference between control and phosphorylated sarcoplasmic reticulum (n = 2.0), indicating that phosphorylation does not alter the cooperativity between calcium sites on the calcium pump. The EC50 for calcium activation of calcium transport by control vesicles was 0.86 +/- 0.1 microM calcium, and phosphorylation of phospholamban decreased this value to 0.61 +/- 0.07 microM calcium (n = 7, p less than 0.028), indicating an increase in the apparent affinity for calcium upon phosphorylation. These results were found to be specific for calcium-calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation of phospholamban. Control experiments on the effects of the reactants used in the phosphorylation assay and subsequent centrifugation of sarcoplasmic reticulum showed no alteration of the rate of calcium transport. Therefore, the calcium pump in cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum appears to be regulated by an endogenous calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, and this may provide an important regulatory mechanism for the myocardium."
https://openalex.org/W1596697122,"The effects of vanadate on the kinetics of ATP binding and hydrolysis by Tetrahymena 30 S dynein were examined by presteady state kinetic analysis. Up to a concentration of 400 microM, vanadate did not inhibit the rate or amplitude of the ATP binding-induced dissociation of the microtubule-dynein complex measured by stopped flow light-scattering methods. Chemical quench flow experiments showed that vanadate (80 microM) did not alter the rate or amplitude of the presteady state ATP binding or ATP hydrolysis transients, but the steady state hydrolysis of ATP was blocked immediately after a single turnover of ATP. Preincubation of the enzyme with ADP and vanadate inhibited both presteady state and steady state hydrolysis. These data suggest that vanadate acts as a phosphate analog to form an enzyme-ADP-vanadate complex, analogous to the transition state during catalysis, by the following pathway: (formula; see text) where V represents vanadate and D represents a dynein active site. ADP and vanadate, added together, induced dissociation of the microtubule-dynein complex at a maximum rate of 0.6 S-1. These observations imply that a microtubule-dynein-ADP-vanadate complex was formed which subsequently dissociated as shown below: (formula; see text) where M denotes a microtubule. The ADP plus vanadate-induced dissociation may represent the reverse of the normal forward pathway involving the binding of a dynein-ADP-phosphate complex to a microtubule."
https://openalex.org/W2113138371,"Many nuclear-coded mitochondrial proteins are synthesized as larger precursor polypeptides that are proteolytically processed during import into the mitochondrion. This processing appears to be catalyzed by a soluble, metal-dependent protease localized in the mitochondrial matrix. In this report we employ an in vitro system to investigate the role of processing in protein import. Intact Neurospora crassa mitochondria were incubated with radiolabeled precursors in the presence of the chelator o-phenanthroline. Under these conditions, the processing of the precursors of the beta-subunit of F1-ATPase (F1 beta) and subunit 9 of the F0F1-ATPase was strongly inhibited. Protease-mapping studies indicated that import of the precursor proteins into the mitochondria continued in the absence of processing. Upon readdition of divalent metal to the treated mitochondria, the imported precursors were quantitatively converted to their mature forms. This processing of imported precursors occurred in the absence of a mitochondrial membrane potential and was extremely rapid even at 0 degrees C. This suggests that all or part of the polypeptide chain of the imported precursors had been translocated into the matrix location of the processing enzyme. Localization experiments suggested that the precursor to F1 beta is peripherally associated with the mitochondrial membrane while the precursor to subunit 9 appeared to be tightly bound to the membrane. We conclude that proteolytic processing is not necessary for the translocation of precursor proteins across mitochondrial membranes, but rather occurs subsequent to this event. On the basis of these and other results, a hypothetical pathway for the import of F1 beta and subunit 9 is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W76374496,"A beta 1-3-N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferase has been detected in human serum which transfers N-acetylglucosamine residues from UDP-GlcNAc to terminal Gal beta 1-4Glc(NAc) structures in oligosaccharides, glycoproteins, glycolipids, and proteoglycans. The product of the transferase reaction with lactose as acceptor was identified by methylation analysis and mass spectrometry as GlcNAc beta 1-3Gal beta 1-4Glc. The beta-linkage of the GlcNAc in the synthesized trisaccharide was confirmed by the action of the specific enzymes beta-hexosaminidase and beta-N-acetylglucosaminide beta 1-4-galactosyltransferase. Kinetic parameters were determined for UDP-GlcNAc, lactose, and N-acetyllactosamine. The enzyme requires Mn2+ ions for maximal activity and shows a pH optimum between 6 and 8. Using a wide variety of synthetic and natural oligosaccharides, the substrate specificity of the beta 1-3N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase was investigated. The enzyme was found to recognize specifically the free terminal structure Gal beta 1-4Glc(NAc). The substrate specificity was found to be equally stringent for glycoconjugates. Among the glycoproteins and glycolipids tested as acceptors, N-acetylglucosamine was incorporated only into those containing free terminal Gal beta 1-4Glc(NAc) structures. When the terminal galactose residues were partially removed, the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine was strongly reduced."
https://openalex.org/W1592110586,"The kinetics of ATP binding and hydrolysis (formation of acid-labile phosphate) by the Tetrahymena 30 S dynein ATPase has been measured by chemical quench flow methods. The amplitude of the ATP-binding transient gave a molecular weight per ATP-binding site of approximately 750,000, suggesting nearly 3 ATP binding sites/2 million Mr dynein molecule (Johnson, K. A., and Wall, J.S. (1983) J. Cell Biol. 96, 669-678). ATP binding occurred at the rate predicted from the apparent second order rate constant of 4.7 X 10(6) M-1 S-1 measured by analysis of the ATP-induced dissociation of the microtubule-dynein complex (Porter, M. E., and Johnson, K. A. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 6582-6587). Hydrolysis was slower than binding and occurred at a rate of 55 S-1, at 30 and 50 microM ATP. The rate limiting step for steady state turnover (product release) occurred with a rate constant of 8 S-1. These data show that the first two steps of the pathway of coupling ATP hydrolysis to the microtubule-dynein cross-bridge cycle are the same as those described by Lymn and Taylor for actomyosin (Lymn, R. W., and Taylor, E. W. (1971) Biochemistry 10, 4617-4624). Namely, ATP binding induces the very rapid dissociation of dynein from the microtubule and ATP hydrolysis occurs more slowly following dissociation. Moreover, in spite of rather gross structural differences, the kinetic constants for dynein and myosin are quite similar."
https://openalex.org/W1484375997,"Rat ovarian granulosa cells were isolated from immature female rats after stimulation with pregnant mare's serum gonadotropin and maintained in culture. Proteoglycans were labeled using [35S]sulfate, [3H]serine, [3H]glucosamine, or [3H]mannose as precursors. A species of heparan sulfate proteoglycan was purified using DEAE-Sephacel chromatography under dissociative conditions in the presence of detergent. The heparan sulfate proteoglycan, which constituted approximately 15% of the 35S-labeled proteoglycans in the culture medium has a similar hydrodynamic size (Kd = 0.62 on Sepharose CL-2B) and buoyant density distribution in CsCl density gradients as the low buoyant density dermatan sulfate proteoglycan synthesized by the same granulosa cells and described in the accompanying report (Yanagishita, M., and Hascall, V. C. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 12847-12856). The heparan sulfate chains (average Mr = 28,000) have an average of 0.8-0.9 sulfate groups/repeating disaccharide, of which 50% are N-sulfate, 30% are alkaline-labile O-sulfate (presumably on the 6-position of glucosamine residues), and 20% are alkaline-resistant O-sulfate groups. Alkaline borohydride treatment released both N-linked oligosaccharide-peptides containing mannose, glucosamine, and sialic acid, and O-linked oligosaccharides. Trypsin digestion of the proteoglycan generated fragments which contain (a) glycosaminoglycan-peptides with an average of 2 heparan sulfate chains/peptide; (b) clusters of O-linked oligosaccharides on peptides; and (c) N-linked oligosaccharide-peptides, which are as small as single N-linked oligosaccharides. The compositions of the O-linked and N-linked oligosaccharides and the trypsin fragments of this heparan sulfate proteoglycan were very similar to those of the low buoyant density dermatan sulfate proteoglycan synthesized by the same cells."

Two contrasting responses were observed: (a) a rapid and specific accumulation in the medium of a newly synthesized protein of molecular weight 48,000 and (b) a subsequent general inhibition of the release of proteins within the first 6 days of treatment while the cell number was not altered. These responses were triggered by physiologically active concentrations of progestins (progesterone, R5020, medroxyprogesterone acetate) but not by other classes of steroids, and were not observed in a progesterone receptor negative cell line (BT20), indicating that they were mediated by the progesterone receptor. A progestin antagonist, RU38,486, inhibited the production of the 48-kilodalton released protein. The production of androgen-regulated proteins (43 kilodaltons, 18 kilodaltons) was also increased by dihydrotestosterone and higher concentrations of R5020. These results show that progestins specifically regulate the production of proteins in cell culture. Subsequently, R5020 also inhibit the growth of T47D cells in the presence of estradiol (Vignon, F., Bardon, S., Chalbos, D., and Rochefort, H. (1983) J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 56, 1124-1130), suggesting that the proteins released into the medium may be related to the control of cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1495648604,"The phosphorylation of sarcoplasmic reticulum ATPase with Pi in the absence of Ca2+ was studied by equilibrium and kinetic experimentation. The combination of these measurements was then subjected to analysis without assumptions on the stoichiometry of the reactive sites. The analysis indicates that the species undergoing covalent interaction is the tertiary complex E X Pi X Mg formed by independent interaction of the two ligands with the enzyme. The binding constant of Pi or Mg2+ to either free or partially associated enzyme is approximately equal to 10(2) M-1, and no significant synergistic effect is produced by one ligand on the binding of the other; the equilibrium constant (Keq) for the covalent reaction E X Pi X Mg E-P X Mg is approximately equal to 16, with kphosph = 53 s-1, and khyd = 3-4 s-1 (25 degrees C, pH 6.0, no K+). The phosphorylation reaction of sarcoplasmic reticulum ATPase with Pi is highly H+ dependent. Such a pH dependence involves the affinity of enzyme for different ionization states of Pi, as well as protonation of two protein residues per enzyme unit in order to obtain optimal phosphorylation. The experimental data can then be fitted satisfactorily assuming pK values of 5.7 and 8.5 for the two residues in the nonphosphorylated enzyme (changing to 7.7 for one of the two residues, following phosphorylation) and values of 50.0 and 0.58 for the equilibrium constants of the H2(E X HPO4) in equilibrium with H(E-PO3) + H2O and H(E X HPO4) in equilibrium with E-PO3 + H2O reactions, respectively. In addition to the interdependence of H+ and phosphorylation sites, an interdependence of Ca2+ and phosphorylation sites is revealed by total inhibition of the Pi reaction when two high affinity calcium sites per enzyme unit are occupied by calcium. Conversely, occupancy of the phosphate site by vanadate (a stable transition state analogue of phosphate) inhibits high affinity calcium binding. The known binding competition between the two cations and their opposite effects on the phosphorylation reaction suggest that interdependence of phosphorylation site, H+ sites, and Ca2+ sites is a basic mechanistic feature of enzyme catalysis and cation transport."

https://openalex.org/W1552252619,"In order to study the mechanism for activation of ATP hydrolysis by Mg2+, the stoichiometry of the high affinity calcium-binding sites with respect to each form of reaction intermediate of sarcoplasmic reticulum ATPase was determined at 0 degrees C and pH 7.0 in the presence and absence of added Mg2+ using the purified ATPase preparation. High affinity calcium binding to the enzyme-ATP complex and to ADP-sensitive (E1P) and ADP-insensitive (E2P) phosphoenzymes occurred with stoichiometric ratios of 2, 2, and 0, and 3, 3, and 1 in the presence and absence of added Mg2+, respectively. The results were interpreted to indicate that in addition to 2 mol of calcium bound to the transport sites of the ATPase, 1 mol of divalent cation, which is derived from the metal component of the substrate, the metal-ATP complex, remains bound to each mole of the enzyme at least until E2P is hydrolyzed. As activation of phosphoenzyme hydrolysis by Mg2+ was blocked by the low concentrations of Ca2+ used in the calcium binding experiments, it was concluded that it is the magnesium derived from MgATP that is responsible for rapid hydrolysis of the phosphoenzyme intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W1511069912,"We have examined the kinetics of ATP-induced dissociation of the microtubule-dynein complex at low ATP concentrations in the presence of vanadate, which inhibits the enzyme after the binding and hydrolysis of a single ATP per site (Shimizu, T., and Johnson, K. A. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 13833-13840). Four aspects of the dissociation reaction could not be explained by a model of dynein with a single ATP-sensitive microtubule binding site. First, titration of the light-scattering amplitude versus ATP concentration in the presence of vanadate gave Mr = 720,000/ATP binding site, indicating approximately 2.8 sites/2 million molecular weight particle. Second, the dissociation reaction was incomplete at concentrations of less than 2 microM ATP in the absence of vanadate, while the addition of vanadate led to complete dissociation at an increased rate. Third, the time course of dissociation induced by less than or equal to 1 microM ATP in the presence of vanadate was biphasic, with a small but distinct lag. Fourth, the ATP concentration dependence of the rate of dissociation in the absence of vanadate was concave upward at concentrations of ATP less than 5 microM, whereas the plot was linear in the presence of vanadate. These data suggest that dynein has three ATP-sensitive microtubule binding sites and each site must bind ATP for dynein to detach from the microtubule."
https://openalex.org/W1529933594,"Nucleosome core particles form well defined complexes with the nuclear nonhistone proteins HMG 14 or 17. The binding of HMG 14 or 17 to nucleosomes results in greater stability of the nucleosomal DNA as shown by circular dichroism and thermal denaturation. Under appropriate conditions the binding is cooperative, and cooperativity is ionic strength dependent. The specificity and cooperative transitions of high mobility group (HMG) binding are preserved in 1 M urea. Specificity is lost in 4 M urea. Thermal denaturation and circular dichroism show a dramatic reversal of the effects of urea on nucleosomes when HMG 14 or 17 is bound, indicating stabilization of the nucleosome by HMG proteins. Complexes formed between reconstructed nucleosomes containing purified inner histones plus poly(dA-dT) and HMG 14 or 17 demonstrate that the HMG binding site requires only DNA and histones. Electron microscopy reveals no major structural alterations in the nucleosome upon binding of HMG 14 or 17. Cross-linking the nucleosome extensively with formaldehyde under cooperative HMG binding conditions does not prevent the ionic strength-dependent shift to noncooperative binding. This suggests mechanisms other than internal nucleosome conformational changes may be involved in cooperative HMG binding."
https://openalex.org/W1541696918,"The fidelity with which wild type T4 DNA polymerase copies phi X174 amber 3 plus strand DNA at position 587 in vitro has been measured. Synthesis is initiated by hybridizing to the template a HaeIII restriction fragment whose 3'-OH terminus is 83 nucleotides from the amber 3 site. Based on gel electrophoresis of product DNA molecules and genetic marker rescue data, T4 DNA polymerase copies significantly beyond the mutant site. Transfection analysis shows that the A X T leads to G X C mutation at position 587 occurs 10- to 100-fold less frequently with T4 DNA polymerase than with E. coli DNA polymerase I. The aberrant incorporation of cytosine opposite adenine at position 587 by the T4 polymerase alone is occurring at a frequency not greater than about 10(-7) which, for this particular locus, may be similar to the fidelity exhibited by the T4 accessory proteins plus the polymerase comprising the replication complex. A comparison of the accuracy of mutator L56 and antimutator L141 T4 DNA polymerases relative to wild type shows at most a 2- to 4-fold decrease and increase, respectively, in fidelity. When compared to 10- to 1000-fold effects on mutation frequencies that these same mutant alleles have in vivo, these results suggest that the wide range in expression of mutator and antimutator phenotypes in vivo may be dependent on an abnormal interaction of the aberrant DNA polymerases with other protein components of the replication complex."
https://openalex.org/W1480256726,"We have studied the affinity between fibroblast proteoheparan sulfate (medium- and cell surface-derived species) and heparan sulfate-agaroses by affinity chromatography. The evidence for an interaction between the heparan sulfate side chains of the proteoglycans and the immobilized heparan sulfate are as follows: (a) the individual side chains released from the proteoglycan by papain bind to the affinity matrix, (b) the bound proteoglycans are desorbed by a solution of cognate heparan sulfate chains, and (c) the core protein obtained by heparan sulfate-lyase digestion of the proteoglycan does not bind to the affinity matrix. The proteoglycans interact only with one subtype of heparan sulfate. The binding of free heparan sulfate chains to the affinity matrix is completely abolished by heparan sulfate oligosaccharides provided they are composed of both iduronate- and glucuronate-containing disaccharide sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1557756488,"Pachytene nuclei were isolated from rat testes by the unit gravity sedimentation technique and contained histone variants H1a, H1t, TH2A, TH2B, and X2 in addition to the somatic histones H1bde, H1c, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. The basic organization of the pachytene chromatin namely the nucleosome repeat length and the accessibility to micrococcal nuclease, was similar to that of rat liver interphase chromatin. However, when digested by DNase I, the susceptibility of pachytene chromatin was 25% more than liver chromatin under identical conditions. Nucleosome core particles were isolated from both liver and pachytene nuclei and were characterized for their DNA length and integrity of the nucleoprotein on low ionic strength nucleoprotein gels. While liver core particles contained all the somatic histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, in the pachytene core particles, histone variants TH2A, X2, and TH2B had replaced nearly 60% of the respective somatic histones. A comparison of the circular dichroism spectra obtained for pachytene and liver core particles indicated that the pachytene core particles were less compact than the liver core particles. Studies on the thermal denaturation properties of the two types of core particles revealed that the fraction of the pachytene core DNA melting at the premelting temperature region of 55-60 degrees C was significantly higher than that of the liver core DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1586997567,"The substrate specificity of the calcium ATPase of isolated sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles was examined using a series of ribose-modified ATP analogs. Steady state hydrolytic rate measurements using analogs modified at the 2'- and 3'-positions demonstrate that both hydroxyl groups contribute to substrate specificity and high catalytic activity. The 3'-hydroxyl is especially significant in this regard since all analogs modified at the 3'-position were slowly hydrolyzed, if at all, and they did not produce the activation at millimolar concentrations characteristically observed with ATP. In contrast, ATP analogs modified only at the 2'-position were more rapidly hydrolyzed (although at rates less than for ATP), and they did produce activation at millimolar concentrations. These results suggest that neither the catalytic (high affinity) nor the regulatory (low affinity) site of the CaATPase tolerates changes in the hydroxyl substituent at the 3'-position of ATP, whereas steady state rates associated with substrate binding at both types of sites are less affected by changes in the 2'-hydroxyl of ATP."
https://openalex.org/W1589141925,"The soluble F1-ATPase from the thermophilic bacterium PS3 (TF1) contains no endogenous adenine nucleotides and contains about 0.2 g ions of Mg2+/mol which resists removal by repeated centrifugation-elution on columns of Sephadex G-50. The isolated enzyme will not bind additional Mg2+ added in the absence of adenine nucleotides nor is the rate of inactivation of the isolated enzyme by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) affected by the addition of Mg2+. When ADP is added to isolated TF1, a 1:1 TF1 X ADP complex is formed which is stable to repeated gel permeation on columns of Sephadex G-50 subjected to centrifugation-elution. On formation of the 1:1 TF1 X ADP complex, the rate of inactivation of the enzyme by DCCD is accelerated 6-fold. The rate of inactivation of the 1:1 TF1 X ADP complex by DCCD is not further stimulated in the presence of 2 mM ADP which indicates that the binding of ADP to a single site in the enzyme is sufficient to promote maximal stimulation of the inactivation. Addition of Mg2+ to the 1:1 TF1 X ADP complex results in the binding of about 1 g ion of Mg2+/mol of enzyme. The 1:1:1 TF1 X ADP X Mg2+ complex thus formed is sluggishly inactivated by DCCD. When the Mg2+ is removed from the TF1 X ADP X Mg2+ complex by treatment with trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid, the rate of inactivation of the enzyme by DCCD is accelerated 4-fold. Other divalent metal ions protect the 1:1 TF1 X ADP complex against inactivation by DCCD. Of these, Mn2+, Zn2+, Co2+, and Cd2+, which are about as equally effective as Mg2+ as cofactors for the hydrolytic reaction when present at 0.2 mM, offer about equal protection of the complex against inactivation by DCCD also when present at 0.2 mM. These results indicate that the binding site for ADP in the 1:1 TF1 X ADP complex is a catalytic site. TF1, inactivated by 92% with DCCD, has the same capacity to bind ADP as the active enzyme, forming a tight 1:1 TF1 X ADP complex which is stable to repeated centrifugation-elution on columns of Sephadex G-50. The 1:1 TF1 X ADP complex retains its capacity to bind Mg2+ to form the 1:1:1 TF1 X ADP X Mg2+ complex after it is inactivated by 88% with DCCD."
https://openalex.org/W1584259705,"Abstract Incubation of myosin with myopathic hamster protease results in substantial (more than 80%) removal of light chain 2 (LC2) with limited breakdown of the heavy chains. LC2-deficient myosin, purified by ion exchange chromatography, migrates as a single, monodisperse boundary in the analytical ultracentrifuge. The Ca2+- and EDTA-activated ATPases of LC2-deficient myosin are similar to those of the control and LC2-recombined myosins indicating that no denaturation occurred in its preparation. Double reciprocal plots for LC2-deficient, control, and LC2-recombined myosins reveal a biphasic behavior i.e. at actin concentrations above 11 microM, there is a sharp break in the 1/V versus 1/[actin] plots for all samples. The Vm values for LC2-deficient myosin are 50% lower (at low actin, Vm = 3.0 s-1, and at high actin, Vm = 4.2 s-1) than those for control myosin (Vm = 5.3 s-1 at low actin and 8.3 s-1 at high actin). Readdition of LC2 to LC2-deficient myosin restores the actin-activated ATPase to control levels. Electron microscopy of shadow cast preparations reveals a subtle difference between LC2-deficient myosin, and control or recombined myosin. In control and recombined myosins, S1 heads appear pear-shaped, whereas in LC2-deficient myosin, the S1 heads are rounder and display a thinning of mass in the neck region, suggesting that LC2 binds at the S1/S2 junction. Furthermore, removal of LC2 apparently influences the assembly of myosin into minifilaments, as revealed to a certain degree, by an increase in the width of the bare zone, accompanied by a decrease in the stability of these minifilaments."
https://openalex.org/W1559617413,"In order to understand the effect of phosphorylation on phosphofructokinase, the allosteric kinetic behavior, ligand binding at various pHs, and pH-dependent cold inactivation of phosphofructokinase phosphorylated to different extents were studied. A subtilisin-digested phosphofructokinase from which a COOH-terminal peptide containing a phosphorylation site has been cleaved (Riquelme, P. T., and Kemp, R. G. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 4367-4371) was also included in these studies in order to investigate the possible role of this region of the molecule. Allosteric kinetics and direct binding experiments have shown that increasing phosphorylation of phosphofructokinase results in increased sensitivity to ATP inhibition and stronger binding of ATP to the inhibitory site of the enzyme. Ths subtilisin-cleaved phosphofructokinase is the least sensitive to the inhibition and shows the weakest binding of ATP. The opposite effect is observed with the binding isotherms of fructose-6-P. There is no difference in the binding of fructose-2,6-P2 among these enzymes. Binding of ATP to the inhibitory site of these enzymes as determined by fluorescence quenching (Pettigrew, D. W., and Frieden, C. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 1887-1895) is affected by pH; the binding is greatly enhanced at lower pH. Moreover, there is little difference in the binding among the modified enzymes at pH 8, but at lower pHs the binding to the phosphorylated enzyme is much more enhanced than the dephosphoenzyme. A pH-dependent cold inactivation study has shown that the phosphorylation of the enzyme causes an increase in the pK value for the inactivation, and the extent of the pK shift depends upon the degree of phosphorylation. Based on these results, a model originally proposed by Frieden et al. (Frieden, C., Gilbert, H. R., and Bock, P. E. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 5644-5647) can be applied to explain a possible role for the phosphorylation and the peptide portion of phosphofructokinase in its complex allosteric kinetic behavior."
https://openalex.org/W1977737043,"The Mu mom gene is transcribed only when DNA is methylated by Dam; this methylation dependence is determined by a region upstream of the gene containing three Dam-methylation sites. The mom operon contains two open reading frames, one of which codes for Mom. Experiments were done to find a function for the other reading frame; it is shown that it does not affect phage immunity or the regulation of mom expression. Deletion mapping and S1 nuclease mapping experiments identify the +1 of the mom mRNA: it is 45 bp downstream of the three Dam-methylation sites. Possible models for the short-distance transcription regulation by methylation are discussed. The mom promoter is surrounded by sequences that are shown to be homologous to the oriC region of E. coli. This suggests a relation between replication and methylation-dependent mom expression. It is shown however, that replication is not essential for mom expression."
https://openalex.org/W1520765486,"Two components of the fibrinolytic system, plasminogen and the vascular plasminogen activator, have been isolated to apparent homogeneity from the post-venous occlusion plasma of three diabetic patients (hemoglobin A1C greater than 7%) and of one nondiabetic control person. Plasminogen activation was studied for each person separately in the absence and presence of CNBr fragments of fibrinogen. Activation of diabetic plasminogen by urokinase was not significantly altered as compared to the activation of control plasminogen. The same was found when diabetic plasminogen was activated by control vascular plasminogen activator in the presence of fibrinogen fragments but only at plasminogen concentrations below 10-30 nM; at higher substrate concentrations, however, plasminogen activation was impaired in a pattern resembling substrate inhibition. Activation of control plasminogen by diabetic vascular plasminogen activator was completely impaired in the absence of fibrinogen fragments. Addition of fibrinogen fragments stimulated plasmin formation by diabetic vascular plasminogen activator resulting in kinetic constants which were similar to the activation of control plasminogen by control vascular plasminogen activator in the absence of fibrinogen fragments (Km = 7.5 microM, kcat = 0.05 S-1). Addition of fibrinogen fragments in controls decreased Km values to less than 0.1 microM. Despite addition of fibrinogen fragments the rate of plasmin formation from diabetic plasminogen by diabetic vascular plasminogen activator isolated from the same diabetic donor was so small that kinetic constants could not be calculated."
https://openalex.org/W1513487304,"A detailed functional characterization of reconstituted sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) vesicles with similar lipid content as normal SR was obtained by studies of ATPase activity and calcium transport in transient state, steady state, and equilibrium conditions. For this purpose, enzyme phosphorylation with ATP, hydrolytic activity, calcium transport, phosphorylation with Pi, and ATP synthesis by reversal of the pump were measured, and utilized to demonstrate function and orientation of catalytic sites. The preparations used in these studies displayed the highest activity reported for reconstituted sarcoplasmic reticulum systems. The rates of phosphoenzyme formation from ATP and hydrolysis as well as steady state levels matched the values obtained with normal SR vesicles. Calcium transport and repeated cycles of ATP synthesis by reversal of the pump were also obtained. However, the efficiency of transport and ATP synthesis from a Ca2+ gradient was approximately three times lower than in native vesicles. This deficiency could not be attributed to passive calcium leak from the reconstituted vesicles but, in part, can be explained by the bidirectional alignment of the calcium pump in reconstituted SR. It is suggested that vectorial transport requires a more complex level of protein structure than that for sustaining simple ATPase activity. Time resolution of the phosphorylation reaction by rapid quench methods can be used to estimate the orientation of the calcium pump in the membrane. Such studies indicate that the calcium pump protein is largely bidirectionally oriented in reconstituted SR vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W1514700980,The possibility that chromatin domains containing acetylated histones are proximal to domains containing chromosomal high mobility group protein 17 (HMG-17) has been investigated. Oligonucleosomes containing [3H]acetate-labeled histones have been immunofractionated on anti-HMG-17 IgG-Sepharose columns. Ninety-one per cent of the 3H counts present in the oligonucleosomes specifically bound to the anti-HMG-17 column. Extraction of HMG-17 from chromatin by treatment with 0.4 M NaCl abolished the specific binding of acetylated chromatin to the Sepharose columns. Autoradiographic analysis of polyacrylamide gels of the bound fraction revealed that it contained all the major acetylated histone species. We conclude that acetylated histones are present on or near nucleosomes containing protein HMG-17.
https://openalex.org/W1540521461,"The rate of MgATP hydrolysis (v) by the Neurospora plasma membrane ATPase shows a sigmoid relationship to substrate concentration ( [S] ), which is precisely fit by the equation: v = (Vmax X [S]2)/(Km + [S]2). This equation describes an enzyme with two substrate-binding sites, both of which must be filled for hydrolysis to occur. At concentrations above 1 mM, both free Mg2+ and free ATP behave as competitive inhibitors of the ATPase. Free ATP, although not hydrolyzed, can also significantly stimulate the rate of activity at low substrate concentrations, thus reducing the sigmoidicity in the v versus [S] curve. Vanadate also stimulates the ATPase if the MgATP concentration is below the Km. (Vanadate is a potent inhibitor of activity at saturating MgATP concentrations.) The effect of vanadate is to eliminate the sigmoidicity in the v versus [S] plot. The kinetic behavior of the ATPase suggests that binding to one active site by MgATP, free ATP, or vanadate permits hydrolysis of MgATP at a second site."

https://openalex.org/W1551885117,"Abstract A Ca2+-activated ATPase activity is present in the chick embryonic chorioallantoic membrane (CAM), the placenta-like tissue which translocates eggshell calcium into the embryonic circulation. The enzyme is membrane-bound, ATP-specific, Mg2+-dependent, exhibits dual Km values of 30 microM and 0.3 mM Ca2+, and has a Mr of 170,000. Throughout embryonic development, a single electrophoretic form of the Ca2+-ATPase is found and, furthermore, its specific activity as a function of age follows a bimodal pattern. In particular, from incubation days 14-15 to the end of gestation, a period representing rapid embryonic calcium accumulation, Ca2+-ATPase specific activity increases 6-fold. Cytohistochemistry localized the Ca2+-ATPase exclusively within the CAM ectoderm which lies adjacent to the calcium-rich shell membrane/eggshell. In a parallel study, cleavable bifunctional cross-linking agents were used to characterize the in situ protein topography of the CAM ectodermal surface adjacent to the calcium-binding protein (CaBP), a CAM cell-surface protein associated with calcium transport. We found that the immediate near neighbor of the CaBP is a 170,000 Mr, membrane-bound protein. The 170,000 protein was co-isolated with the CaBP after cross-linkage in situ and subsequent immunoprecipitation with anti-CaBP antibodies. Reductive cleavage of the immune complex released detectable Ca2+-ATPase activity, suggesting that the 170,000 protein is the Ca2+-ATPase of the CAM."
https://openalex.org/W1652549330,"Mast cells and related cells have on their surface receptors that bind immunoglobulin E (IgE) with high affinity and which, when aggregated, trigger exocytosis. We recently demonstrated that when these receptors are solubilized with mild detergents, their subunits dissociate unless an appropriate lipid:detergent ratio is maintained. The conditions required to maintain the receptors' integrity appeared to parallel those previously determined as necessary to obtain adequate incorporation of unpurified IgE-receptor complexes from detergent extracts into liposomes. We now show that purified IgE-receptor complexes having the full complement of subunits become preferentially inserted into liposomes. If the receptor subunits are chemically cross-linked to each other, at least some of such receptors can be incorporated, even though lipid is omitted during their purification. The findings suggest that the IgE-binding alpha subunit of the receptor is anchored to the bilayer by means of one or both of the other subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1604253293,"The action of the natural ATPase inhibitor protein of Pullman and Monroy (Pullman, M. E., and Monroy, G. C. (1963) J. Biol. Chem. 238, 3762-3769) on the mechanisms of energy conservation of heart mitochondria has been explored. The synthesis and hydrolysis of ATP and the Pi-ATP exchange reaction were studied in submitochondrial particles that possess the ATPase-inhibitor protein complex in two distinguishable states. In addition to their different rates of hydrolysis, the two states of the complex have been identified from their different accessibility to antibodies directed against the inhibitor protein, and from the different action of antibodies and trypsin on the ATPase activity of the two types of particles studied. The steady state rates of hydrolysis and of the Pi-ATP exchange reaction of the particles are determined by the state in which the ATPase-inhibitor complex exists. Apparently by modifying the rate of one of the steps involved in the catalytic reaction of the ATPase, the inhibitor protein determines the extent to which the enzyme is able to catalyze ATP hydrolysis and the Pi-ATP exchange reaction. This action of the inhibitor protein also reflects the rate at which the particles carry out oxidative phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1519922613,"ATP hydrolysis, the exchange of inorganic phosphate with ATP, and ATP synthesis have been studied as a function of Mg2+ concentration in bovine heart submitochondrial particles. The rate of exchange is low at concentrations of Mg2+ below 3 mM, at higher concentrations, the exchange is several times higher. ATP hydrolysis shows a different pattern with respect to the concentration of Mg2+. The ratio of ATP hydrolyzed to ATP exchanged is above 20 at Mg2+ concentrations below 3 mM and about 5 at high Mg2+ concentrations; ADP induces a further drop of the ratio (2-3). By assays of the sensitivity of the hydrolytic reaction to organic solvents (dimethyl sulfoxide), it has been possible to determine the rate-limiting step of ATP hydrolysis. At 3 mM Mg2+, the rate-limiting step is the release of ADP in the soluble, but not in the particulate enzyme. However at higher Mg2+ concentrations, the rate-limiting step in the particulate enzyme is also ADP release. Therefore, the decrease in the ratio of ATP hydrolysis to inorganic phosphate incorporated into ATP coincides with a change in the kinetics of the enzyme, i.e. when the terminal step of ATP hydrolysis becomes rate-limiting, the inorganic phosphate-ATP exchange increases. Ca2+ induces an increase in the phosphate-ATP exchange at low Mg2+ concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W1556933850,"The localization of collagen hydroxylysine galactosyl- and galactosyl-hydroxylysine glucosyltransferases in purified chick embryo bone microsomes was studied by differential solubilization with nonionic detergents. Brij-35 (polyoxyethylene 25-lauryl ether) which selectively releases intracisternal proteins, and Triton X-100, whose specificity varies with its concentration, were used in the presence or absence of high ionic strength NaCl. These methods were used previously to characterize prolyl hydroxylase as intracisternal and lysyl hydroxylase as mainly intramembranous. The distribution of both glycosyltransferases within microsomes was similar to that of lysyl hydroxylase; approximately 70-80% of their activities are intramembranous with the remainder intracisternal. Collagen hydroxylysine glucosyltransferase differed from prolyl and lysyl hydroxylase and the galactosyltransferase in that its activity in vitro was apparently inhibited by membrane vesicles, even in the presence of detergents at concentrations which permeabilize the membrane. Accurate measurement of its activity could be achieved only by its separation from vesicles after detergent treatment. The common location of the major portion of lysyl hydroxylase and the glycosyltransferase activities suggests that they may act as a multienzyme complex to preferentially modify certain lysyl residues in nascent procollagen chains as they traverse the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. Since these enzymes do not act on helical collagen, their physical separation from prolyl hydroxylase may ensure that modifications of lysine residues occur prior to formation of hydroxyproline, which stabilizes the helical form."

A combination was found which causes complete conversion of the normally filamentous germinated conidia to spherical structures in about 1.5 h. Examination of these spheroplasts by scanning electron microscopy indicated that, although they are spherical, they retain a smooth coat that can only be removed upon prolonged incubation in the enzyme mixture (about 10 h). The 10-h incubation in the enzyme mixture appears to have no obvious detrimental effects on the integrity of the plasma membrane since the activity and regulatory properties of the glucose active transport system in 10-h spheroplasts are essentially unimpaired. Importantly, plasma membranes can be isolated from the 10-h spheroplasts by an adaptation of the concanavalin A method developed previously in this laboratory for cells of the cell wall-less sl strain, which is not the case for the 1.5-h spheroplasts. The yield of plasma membrane vesicles isolated by this procedure is 18-36% as indicated by surface labeling with diazotized [125I]iodosulfanilic acid, and the preparation is less than 1% contaminated with mitochondrial protein. The chemical composition of the wild type plasma membranes is similar to that previously reported for membranes of the sl strain of Neurospora. The isolated wild type plasma membrane vesicles also exhibit all of the functional properties that have previously been demonstrated for the sl plasma membrane vesicles. The wild type vesicles catalyze MgATP-dependent electrogenic proton translocation as indicated by the concentrative uptake of [14C]SCN- and [14C]imidazole under the appropriate conditions, which indicates that they contain the plasma membrane H+-ATPase previously shown to exist in the sl plasma membranes and that they possess permeability barrier function as well. The vesicles also contain a Ca2+/H+ antiporter as evidenced by their ability to catalyze protonophore-inhibited MgATP-dependent 45Ca2+ accumulation. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analyses of the isolated vesicles indicate that the protein composition of the wild type vesicles is roughly similar to that of the sl plasma membranes with the H+-ATPase present as a major band of Mr approximately 105,000. The wild type plasma membrane ATPase forms a phosphorylated intermediate similar to that of the sl ATPase, and the specific activity of the H+-ATPase in both wild type and sl membranes is approximately 3 mumol of Pi released/mg of protein/min.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1729693882,"In the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the structural gene mutations A23-13 (alpha-) and B59-1 (beta-) which totally prevent the expression of either the alpha or the beta subunits of the mitochondrial ATPase, were shown by classical genetic mapping studies to be both located on chromosome I but genetically unlinked. It is concluded that the structural genes ATP1 and ATP2 for the alpha and beta subunits of the mitochondrial ATPase are not organized in a cluster. By both meiotic recombination frequency analysis and gene transfer studies, three single nuclear mutations affecting to different extents the electrophoretic mobility of the beta polypeptide were located on the chromosome I very close to the mutation B59-1 (beta-). Two mutations involved a defective ATPase activity and the inability to grow on glycerol (gly). One of these mutants E5-23 exhibited a beta subunit of slightly reduced electrophoretic mobility. The other mutation F1-10 (beta) was associated with a beta subunit of normal electrophoretic mobility. The plasmid pMa2 (Boutry, M., Vassarotti, A., Ghislain, M., Douglas, M., Goffeau, A. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 2840-2844) containing the structural gene for the beta subunit complemented the mutants E5-23 and F1-10 (beta) as well as B59-1 (beta-). These three mutations are therefore likely to affect the beta structural gene itself or a very contiguous gene contained in the 5.4-kilobase genomic insert of pMa2. The mutation F1-10 (beta) was mapped between E5-23 and B59-1 (beta-) by analysis of the meiotic recombination frequencies. Another mutation F25-28-11 (beta') was responsible for an appreciable decrease of electrophoretic mobility of the beta subunit which, however, did not affect either the ATPase activity or the ability to grow on glycerol (GLY). This mutant transformed by pMa2 was able to express the structural gene for the wild type beta subunit and the resulting transformants synthesized and assembled both the beta and beta' subunits. It is concluded that the mutation F25-28-11 (beta') also affects the structural gene for the beta subunit and does not affect genes controlling the processing machinery."
https://openalex.org/W1486197741,"The allosteric transition of yeast phosphofructokinase has been studied by solution x-ray scattering. The scattering curves corresponding to the native enzyme (T conformation) were found to be similar to the curves recorded in the presence of saturating concentrations of fructose 6-phosphate (R conformation) or AMP (R or R' conformation). However, the curves obtained in the presence of ATP are clearly different: the radius of gyration increases and the secondary minima and maxima are systematically shifted to lower angles, suggesting a swelling of the enzyme in the presence of ATP. These results give the first direct evidence for the existence of an ATP-induced T' conformation, distinct in quaternary structure from the R and T states of the enzyme oligomer, in agreement with our previous modeling of yeast phosphofructokinase regulation. X-ray scattering data are discussed in relation to the distinct molecular mechanisms of the ATP and fructose 6-phosphate allosteric effects involving, respectively, sequential and concerted conformational changes of the enzyme oligomer."
https://openalex.org/W1819026167,"A chimeric plasmid carrying the structural gene (ATP2) for the mitochondrial ATPase beta subunit of Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been used to complement a mutant of Schizosaccharomyces pombe lacking the beta subunit (Boutry, M., and Goffeau, A. (1982) Eur. J. Biochem. 125, 471-477). Transformation with ATP2 restored the growth rate of S. pombe mutant on glycerol as well as the mitochondrial ATPase and 32Pi-ATP exchange activities to approximately 20% of the parental strain. Mitochondria prepared from the transformant contained a normal amount of a hybrid F1-ATPase consisting of the S. cerevisiae beta subunit assembled with the remaining subunits of the S. pombe ATPase complex. The presence of the S. cerevisiae beta subunit in the S. pombe ATPase complex conferred a sensitivity to the energy transfer inhibitors citreoviridin and oligomycin which was like that of the intact S. cerevisiae enzyme. The S. cerevisiae beta subunit assembled into the hybrid ATPase complex was the same size as the mature subunit in S. cerevisiae. These data indicate that the mechanism of mitochondrial import and the assembly of the cytoplasmically synthesized subunits is similar or identical in these evolutionary divergent yeasts. In addition, this study provides a new approach for the construction of hybrid mitochondrial ATPase complexes which can be used to examine the function of selected subunits in energy transduction."
