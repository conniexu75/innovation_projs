https://openalex.org/W2063368353,"We report that stimulation inducing long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus evokes significant increases in both BDNF and NT-3 mRNAs in CA1 neurons. No changes in BDNF or NT-3 mRNA levels were seen in the nonstimulated regions of the pyramidal cell layer or the dentate. No change was seen in the levels of NGF mRNA at the time point examined. These results suggest that relatively normal levels of activity may regulate region-specific neurotrophin levels in the hippocampus. Given that known effects of NGF (and presumably of BDNF and NT-3) include elevation of neurotransmitter levels, elevation of sodium channels, and promotion of axonal terminal sprouting, activity-associated changes in neurotrophin levels may play a role in regulating neural connections in the adult as well as the developing nervous system."

https://openalex.org/W2072862965,"Neurotrophins and their receptors are widespread in the developing and mature CNS. Identifying the differentiation state of neurotrophin-responsive cells provides a basis for understanding the developmental functions of these factors. Studies using dissociated and organotypic cultures of rat cerebellum demonstrated that the neurotrophins brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) affect developing granule cells at distinct stages in differentiation. While early granule neurons in the external germinal layer responded to BDNF, more mature granule cells responded to NT-3. BDNF, but not NT-3, enhanced survival of granule cells in cultures of embryonic cerebella. Thus, BDNF and NT-3 have distinct sequential functions that are likely to be critical in the development of the cerebellum. BDNF may promote the initial commitment, while NT-3 may direct the subsequent maturation of granule cells."

https://openalex.org/W1567606707,"Previous studies of alternative splicing of the rat beta-tropomyosin gene have shown that nonmuscle cells contain factors that block the use of the skeletal muscle exon 7 (Guo, W., Mulligan, G. J., Wormsley, S., and Helfman, D. M. (1991) Genes & Dev. 5, 2095-2106). Using an RNA mobility-shift assay we have identified factors in HeLa cell nuclear extracts that specifically interact with sequences responsible for exon blockage. Here we present the purification to apparent homogeneity of a protein that exhibits these sequence specific RNA binding properties. This protein is identical to the polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB) which other studies have suggested is involved in the recognition and efficient use of 3'-splice sites. PTB binds to two distinct functional elements within intron 6 of the beta-tropomyosin pre-mRNA: 1) the polypyrimidine tract sequences required for the use of branch points associated with the splicing of exon 7, and 2) the intron regulatory element that is involved in the repression of exon 7. Our results demonstrate that the sequence requirements for PTB binding are different than previously reported and shows that PTB binding cannot be predicted solely on the basis of pyrimidine content. In addition, PTB fails to bind stably to sequences within intron 5 and intron 7 of beta-TM pre-mRNA, yet forms a stable complex with sequences in intron 6, which is not normally spliced in HeLa cells in vitro and in vivo. The nature of the interactions of PTB within this regulated intron reveals several new details about the binding specificity of PTB and suggests that PTB does not function exclusively in a positive manner in the recognition and use of 3'-splice sites."
https://openalex.org/W1966087966,"We used retrovirus-mediated gene transfer to ask whether integrins are involved in the development of neuroblasts in the chicken optic tectum. Vectors were constructed with the E. coli lacZ gene in the sense orientation and β1 integrin sequences in the antisense orientation. Tests in culture showed that the progeny of cells infected by these vectors were identifiable by expression of LacZ and had reduced levels of β1 integrins on their surfaces. We then injected these vectors into optic tecta on E3, at the height of neuronal production. Clones of LacZ-positive cells were analyzed 3–9 days later, as they migrated along radial gliato form thetectal plate. Antisense sequences had little effect on the proliferation of progenitors, or on the radial stacking of their progeny in the ventricular zone (E6). However, many antisense-bearing cells accumulated in the ventricular zone and failed to migrate into the tectal plate (E7.5 and E9). At later stages (E12), few antisense-bearing cells could be found. Thus, integrin appears to be required in the migratory process, and cells that fail to engage in integrin-mediated interactions may die."
https://openalex.org/W1530120986,"The relationship between the three-dimensional structures of iron-sulfur proteins and the redox potentials of their iron-sulfur clusters is of fundamental importance. We report calculations of the redox potentials of the [Fe4S4(S-cys)4]-2/-3 couple in four crystallographically characterized proteins: Azotobacter vinelandii ferredoxin I, Peptococcus aerogenes ferredoxin, Bacillus thermoproteolyticus ferredoxin, and Chromatium vinosum high potential iron (HiPIP). Our calculations use the protein Langevin dipoles microscopic electrostatic model, which includes both and solvent water. The variations in calculated redox potentials are in excellent agreement with experimental data. In particular, our results confirm the important role of amide groups close to the cluster in separating the potential of C. vinosum HiPIP from those of the other three proteins. However, the potentials of these latter exhibit a substantial range despite extremely similar amide group environments of their clusters. Our results show that the potentials in these proteins are tuned in part by varying the access of solvent water to the neighborhood of the cluster. Our calculations provide the first successful quantitative modeling of the control of iron-sulfur cluster redox potentials."
https://openalex.org/W2163655701,"The details of how high density lipoprotein (HDL) microstructure affects the conformation and net charge of apolipoprotein (apo) A-I in various classes of HDL particles have been investigated in homogeneous recombinant HDL (rHDL) particles containing apoA-I, palmitoyl-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC) and cholesteryl oleate. Isothermal denaturation with guanidine HCl was used to monitor alpha-helix structural stability, whereas electrokinetic analyses and circular dichroism were used to determine particle charge and apoA-I secondary structure, respectively. Electrokinetic analyses show that at pH 8.6 apoA-I has a net negative charge on discoidal (POPC.apoA-I) particles (-5.2 electronic units/mol of apoA-I) which is significantly greater than that of apoA-I either free in solution or on spherical (POPC.cholesteryl oleate.apoA-I) rHDL (approximately -3.5 electronic units). Raising the POPC content (32-128 mol/ml of apoA-I) of discoidal particles 1) increases the particle major diameter from 9.3 to 12.1 nm, 2) increases the alpha-helix content from 62 to 77%, and 3) stabilizes the helical segments by increasing the free energy of unfolding (delta GD degree) from 1.4 to 3.0 kcal/mol of apoA-I. Raising the POPC content (28-58 mol/mol of apoA-I) of spherical particles 1) increases the particle diameter from 7.4 to 12.6 nm, 2) increases the percent alpha-helix from 62 to 69%, and 3) has no significant effect on delta GD degree (2.2 kcal/mol of apoA-I). This study shows that different HDL subspecies maintain particular apoA-I conformations that confer unique charge and structural characteristics on the particles. It is likely that the charge and conformation of apoA-I are critical molecular properties that modulate the metabolism of HDL particles and influence their role in cholesterol transport."
https://openalex.org/W1580370212,"rac1 and rac2 p21s are ras p21-like small GTP-binding proteins which are implicated in the NADPH oxidase-catalyzed superoxide generation in phagocytes. rac1 and rac2 p21s have a Cys-A-A-Leu (A = aliphatic amino acid) structure in their C-terminal region which may undergo post-translational processing including prenylation, proteolysis, and carboxyl methylation. We studied the function of this post-translational processing of rac p21s in their interaction with the stimulatory and inhibitory GDP/GTP exchange proteins for rac p21s, named smg GDS and rho GDI, and in their NADPH oxidase activation. We produced human recombinant rac1 and rac2 p21s in insect cells and purified them from the membrane and soluble fractions as the post-translationally processed and unprocessed forms, respectively. Post-translationally processed rac1 and rac2 p21s were sensitive to both smg GDS and rho GDI, but post-translationally unprocessed rac1 and rac2 p21s were insensitive to them. The GTP gamma S (guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate)-bound form of post-translationally processed rac1 and rac2 p21s stimulated the NADPH oxidase activity, but post-translationally unprocessed rac1 and rac2 p21s were far less effective. These results indicate that both rac1 and rac2 p21s stimulate the NADPH oxidase activity and that their post-translational processing is important not only for their interaction with smg GDS and rho GDI but also for their NADPH oxidase activation."
https://openalex.org/W1604508313,"To elucidate the molecular details of how high density lipoprotein (HDL) microstructure affects the conformation of apolipoprotein (apo) A-I in various classes of HDL particles, apoA-I structure in homogeneous recombinant HDL (rHDL) complexes containing palmitoyl-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC) and cholesteryl oleate has been investigated by NMR spectroscopy of [13C]lysine-labeled apoA-I. All Lys residues in rHDL apoA-I were labeled with 13C by reductive methylation, and then their ionization behavior was characterized by 13C NMR spectroscopy. Four discoidal particles were prepared to contain from 64 to 256 molecules of POPC and 2 molecules of apoA-I; their major diameters ranged from 9.3 to 12.1 nm. (13CH3)2-Lys resonances from apoA-I in discoidal complexes exhibit six distinct chemical shifts at pH 10. The various Lys have pKa values ranging from 8.3 to 10.5, indicating that they exist in different microenvironments. More than 80% of the Lys residues in small (9.3 nm) discoidal particles titrate at a significantly lower pH than in the large (12.1 nm) discoidal particles. This indicates that apoA-I has a different conformation on the differently size discs. Two spherical particles were prepared with POPC:cholesteryl oleate:apoA-I molar stoichiometries of 56:16:2 and 232:84:4 and diameters of 7.4 and 12.6 nm, respectively. On spherical rHDL, apoA-I (13CH3)2-Lys resonances exhibit five distinct chemical shifts at pH 10. The titration behavior of apoA-I Lys residues is the same in small and large spherical particles, indicating that apoA-I conformation is similar on the two particles. The Lys microenvironments indicate that the conformation of apoA-I in discoidal complexes is dependent on particle size and that these conformations are substantially different from that of apoA-I on spherical complexes. Lys microenvironments in discoidal complexes differ from that of spherical complexes by 4 to 5 ysines which titrate with relatively low pKa values on discs. This reflects apparent differences in conformation in the NH2-terminal one-third of apoA-I on discs and spheres."
https://openalex.org/W2067894097,"As detected by coimmunoprecipitation from PC12 cells, NGF induces rapid association between ERK1 (a growth factor-activated serine/threonine protein kinase) and gp140prototrk NGF receptors. In contrast, no such association is found with the closely related ERK2. Anti-trk immunocomplexes generated from NGF-treated cells also contain protein kinase activity that shares many properties with soluble ERK1. The association of both ERK1 protein and ERK-like kinase activity with gp140prototrk is maximal by 5 min of NGF treatment, persists for approximately 1 hr, and subsequently declines by 18 hr. Treatment with either basic fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, or orthovanadate also leads to association of ERK1 with gp140prototrk without tyrosine phosphorylation of the latter. The interaction between ERK1 and gp140prototrk may prove relevant to the NGF mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1589729290,"The mechanism by which DNA activates the classical complement pathway was investigated, with emphasis upon the C1q binding sites involved. DNA bound to both the collagen-like and globular regions of C1q. Binding reactivity with DNA was retained after reduction/alkylation and sodium dodecyl sulfate treatment of C1q. DNA bound preferentially to the A chain of C1q. Binding sites for DNA were localized by using synthetic C1q A chain peptides to two cationic regions within residues 14-26 and 76-92, respectively. Peptides 14-26 and 76-92 avidly bound DNA in enzyme-linked immunosorbent and gel shift assays. Peptide 14-26 also precipitated with DNA and blocked its ability to bind C1q and activate C. Replacement of the two prolines with alanines or scrambling the order of the amino acids resulted in loss of ability of peptide 14-26 to inhibit C1q binding and complement activation by DNA; similar investigations showed a sequence specificity for peptide 76-92 as well. These experiments identify C1q A chain residues 14-26 as the major site, and residues 76-92 as a secondary site, through which DNA binds C1q and activates the classical complement pathway, and demonstrate that a peptide identical to residues 14-26 can modulate C1q binding and complement activation by DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2020326837,"The distribution of the synaptic vesicle-associated phosphoprotein synapsin I after electrical stimulation of the frog neuromuscular junction was investigated by immunogold labeling and compared with the distribution of the integral synaptic vesicle protein synaptophysin. In resting terminals both proteins were localized exclusively on synaptic vesicles. In stimulated terminals they appeared also in the axolemma and its infoldings, which however exhibited a lower synapsin I/synaptophysin ratio with respect to synaptic vesicles at rest. The value of this ratio was intermediate in synaptic vesicles of stimulated terminals, and an increased synapsin I labeling of the cytomatrix was observed. These results indicate that synapsin I undergoes partial dissociation from and reassociation with synaptic vesicles, following physiological stimulation, and are consistent with the proposed modulatory role of the protein in neurotransmitter release."
https://openalex.org/W1496152617,"The Na-K-Cl cotransporter mediates the coupled transport of Na, K, and Cl across the plasma membrane of many animal cell membranes. It is inhibited by loop diuretics such as furosemide, bumetanide, and benzmetanide. We have developed a panel of monoclonal antibodies directed against the 195-kDa shark rectal gland Na-K-Cl cotransport protein. Four representative antibodies (J3, J4, J7, and J25), each of which recognizes a discrete structural domain, were selected for detailed characterization. When a radiolabeled loop diuretic is bound to the cotransporter prior to solubilization, each antibody immunoprecipitates the same diuretic-protein complex. Of the four antibodies, J4 favors the native protein over the denatured one and does not bind well to proteolytic fragments; in contrast, J7 recognizes the cotransporter only after it has been solubilized. J3, J7, and J25 each recognize a unique ensemble of proteolytic fragments of the 195-kDa protein; analysis of the patterns of recognition has yielded a tentative assignment of the approximate location of the epitopes within the peptide. When the cotransport protein is treated with N-glycanase to remove N-linked oligosaccharides, its apparent mass decreases to approximately 135 kDa. The deglycosylated form is recognized by each of the antibodies except J25; this suggests that the J25 epitope is within the oligosaccharide component or in a peptide domain whose folding is disturbed by carbohydrate removal. An immunoaffinity matrix constructed with the J4 antibody permits single-step purification of the 195-kDa protein; other proteins copurify with the large glycoprotein, but none of these appear to be subunits of a stoichiometric complex. The amino acid sequence of four fragments of the 195-kDa cotransport protein is reported. Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy demonstrates, in agreement with physiological evidence, that the 195-kDa protein is distributed along the basolateral membrane and excluded from the apical membrane of the rectal gland secretory cell."
https://openalex.org/W1602267436,"Transcription of the skeletal alpha-actin gene is selectively activated in rat myocardiocytes undergoing hypertrophy both in vivo and in vitro. In most of these models, transient expression of certain proto-oncogene transcription factors precedes hypertrophy and sarcomeric gene induction. Using expression vectors encoding Fos and Jun, the main constituents of transcriptional activator protein AP-1, we analyzed the role of these oncoproteins in mediating the transcriptional induction of skeletal alpha-actin by adrenergic stimulation. Both c-fos and c-jun were induced early after beta-adrenergic stimulation, with peak mRNA levels preceding skeletal alpha-actin induction by several hours. A second peak of c-jun mRNA coincided with skeletal alpha-actin induction. Co-transfection assays in cardiac myocytes and P19 teratocarcinoma cells demonstrated that over-expression of c-jun, or c-fos plus c-jun, transactivated the skeletal alpha-actin promoter by about 5-fold. Comparable activation was not seen for alpha-myosin heavy chain or cardiac alpha-actin promoters. Skeletal alpha-actin promoter sequences between -153 and -36 were required for maximal transactivation by c-fos/c-jun, and purified Fos and Jun were bound specifically within this region. A direct physiological role is suggested for the AP-1 transcription factor complex in regulating skeletal alpha-actin gene expression and alpha-actin isoform switching during the onset of signal-mediated cardiac myocyte hypertrophy."
https://openalex.org/W1594912260,"The 33-kDa manganese-stabilizing protein stabilizes the manganese cluster in the oxygen-evolving complex. There has been, however, a considerable amount of controversy concerning the stoichiometry of this photosystem II (PS II) component. In this paper, we have verified the extinction coefficient of the manganese-stabilizing protein by amino acid analysis, determined the manganese content of oxygen-evolving photosystem II membranes and reaction center complex using inductively coupled plasma spectrometry, and determined immunologically the amount of the manganese-stabilizing protein associated with photosystem II. Oxygen-evolving photosystem II membranes and reaction center complex preparations contained 258 +/- 11 and 67 +/- 3 chlorophyll, respectively, per tetranuclear manganese cluster. Immunoquantification of the manganese-stabilizing protein using mouse polyclonal antibodies on Western blots demonstrated the presence of 2.1 +/- 0.2 and 2.0 +/- 0.3 molecules of the manganese-stabilizing protein/tetranuclear manganese cluster in oxygen-evolving PS II membranes and highly purified PS II reaction center complex, respectively. Since the manganese-stabilizing protein co-migrated with the D2 protein in our electrophoretic system, accurate immunoquantification required the inclusion of CaCl2-washed PS II membrane proteins or reaction center complex proteins in the manganese-stabilizing protein standards to compensate for the possible masking effect of the D2 protein on the binding of the manganese-stabilizing protein to Immobilon-P membranes. Failure to include these additional protein components in the manganese-stabilizing protein standards leads to a marked underestimation of the amount of the manganese-stabilizing protein associated with these photosystem II preparations."
https://openalex.org/W1484709553,"The anaerobic ribonucleoside triphosphate reductase from Escherichia coli reduces CTP to dCTP in the presence of a second protein, named dA1, and a Chelex-treated boiled extract of the bacteria, named RT. The reaction requires S-adenosylmethionine, NADPH, dithiothreitol, ATP, and Mg2+ and K+ ions. It occurs only under anaerobic conditions. We now show that the overall reaction occurs in two steps. The first is an activation of the reductase by dA1 and RT and requires S-adenosylmethionine, NADPH, dithiothreitol, and possibly K+ ions. In the second step, the activated reductase reduces CTP to dCTP with ATP acting as an allosteric effector. During activation, S-adenosylmethionine is cleaved reductively to methionine + 5'-deoxyadenosine. This step is inhibited strongly by S-adenosylhomocysteine and various chelators. The activation of the anaerobic reductase shows a considerable similarity to that of pyruvate formate-lyase (Knappe, J., Neugebauer, F. A., Blaschkowski, H. P., and Ganzler, M. (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 81, 1332-1335)."
https://openalex.org/W1543349787,"p-Hydroxyphenylacetate-3-hydroxylase, an inducible enzyme isolated from the soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida, catalyzes the conversion of p-hydroxyphenylacetate to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetate. The enzyme requires two protein components: a flavoprotein and a colorless protein referred to as the coupling protein. The flavoprotein alone in the presence of p-hydroxyphenylacetate and substrate analogs catalyzes the wasteful oxidation of NADH with the stoichiometric generation of H2O2. A 1:1 complex of the flavoprotein and coupling protein is required for stoichiometric product formation. Such complex formation also eliminates the nonproductive NADH oxidase activity of the flavoprotein. A new assay measuring the product formation activity of the enzyme was developed using homoprotocatechuate-2,3-dioxygenase, as monitoring the oxidation of NADH was not sufficient to demonstrate enzyme activity. The coupling protein does not seem to have any redox center in it. Thus, this 2-component flavin hydroxylase resembles the other aromatic hydroxylases in that the only redox chromophore present is FAD."
https://openalex.org/W1551479053,"The high affinity fibronectin receptor (FNR) is expressed by hematopoietic cells, fibroblasts, and proliferating epidermal cells. Expression of this integrin is altered by chemical and viral transformation, suggesting that FNR dysfunction may play a role in growth control. This study demonstrates that exposing FA-K562 cells to glycine-arginine-glycine-aspartate-serine (GRGDS), a peptide ligand of the FNR, specifically stimulates p34/cdc2- and cyclin A-associated kinase activities. This occurs within 2 h of peptide addition. The 110-kDa form of the retinoblastoma protein appears within 3 h of GRGDS addition, consistent with activation of a G1/S kinase. DNA staining profiles demonstrate that GRGDS induces cell cycle progression within 24 h. Increased anchorage-independent growth is subsequently observed in GRGDS-treated FA-K562 cells. The control peptide, GRGES, which cannot bind the FNR, has none of these effects. This demonstrates that an extracellular integrin ligand can regulate cell proliferation. Furthermore, these results suggest that integrins link the extracellular environment and intracellular growth regulators."

This provided a new approach to identification of amino acid residues involved in Ca2+ binding and in the closure of the gates to the Ca2+ binding pocket of the Ca(2+)-ATPase. The phosphorylation-negative mutant Asp-703-->Ala and mutants of ADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme intermediate type were fully capable of occluding Ca2+, as was the mutant Gly-770-->Ala. Mutants in which carboxylic acid-containing residues in the putative transmembrane segments had been substituted (Ca(2+)-site mutants) and mutant Gly-801-->Val were unable to occlude either of the two calcium ions. In addition, the mutant Gly-310-->Pro, previously classified as ADP-insensitive phosphoenzyme intermediate type (Andersen, J.P., Vilsen, B., and MacLennan, D.H. (1992). J. Biol. Chem. 267, 2767-2774), was unable to occlude Ca2+, even though Ca(2+)-activated phosphorylation from MgATP took place in this mutant."
https://openalex.org/W2021714745,"The Drosophila segmentation gene Krüppel (Kr) is redeployed to play a critical role for the establishment of the larval visual system. Using reporter gene expression conducted by a specific Kr cis-acting element, we were able to trace back the origin of the larval photoreceptor organ, the Bolwig organ, to a single progenitor neuron and to examine Kr function in Bolwig organ development when Kr+ activity is absent from embryos due to specific mutations or reduced by neuron-specific and temporally restricted Kr antisense RNA expression. Our results show that Kr is required for neurons to differentiate into Bolwig organs, for fasciculation of the Bolwig nerve, and for this nerve to follow a specific pathway toward the synaptic targets in the larval brain. The transcription factor encoded by Kr is likely to regulate surface molecules necessary for neuronal cell adhesion and recognition in the developing larval visual system."

Using both light scattering assays and video microscopy, we found that native granules fused to granules that had been inactivated with either trypsin or N-ethylmaleimide. Granules also fused with liposomes prepared from lipids extracted from egg cortices and with liposomes made from synthetic phospholipids and cholesterol. Granule-liposome fusion required no cytoplasmic proteins and was inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide. Thus, membrane fusion of exocytotic granules can be promoted by proteins residing on only one of the two membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1496699014,"Immunoglobulin (Ig)-binding bacterial proteins have attracted theoretical interest for their role in molecular host-parasite interactions, and they are widely used as tools in immunology, biochemistry, medicine, and biotechnology. Protein L of the anaerobic bacterial species Peptostreptococcus magnus binds Ig light chains, whereas streptococcal protein G has affinity for the constant (Fc) region of IgG. In this report, Ig binding parts of protein L and protein G were combined to form a hybrid molecule, protein LG, which was found to bind a large majority of intact human Igs as well as Fc and Fab fragments, and Ig light chains. Binding to Ig was specific, and the affinity constants of the reactions between protein LG and human IgG, IgGFc fragments, and kappa light chains, determined by Scatchard plots, were 5.9 x 10(9), 2.2 x 10(9), and 2.0 x 10(9) M-1, respectively. The binding properties of protein LG were more complete as compared with previously described Ig-binding proteins when also tested against mouse and rat Igs. This hybrid protein thus represents a powerful tool for the binding, detection, and purification of antibodies and antibody fragments."
https://openalex.org/W1502629197,"The high affinity receptor of the cytokine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a heterodimer composed of two members of the cytokine receptor superfamily. GM-CSF binds to the alpha-subunit (GM-R alpha) with low affinity and to the receptor alpha beta complex (GM-R alpha beta) with high affinity. The GM-CSF.GM-R alpha beta complex is responsible for biological activity. Interactions of the N-terminal helix of mouse GM-CSF with mGM-R alpha beta were examined by introducing single alanine substitutions of hydrophilic residues in this region of mGM-CSF. The consequences of these substitutions were evaluated by receptor binding and biological assays. Although all mutant proteins exhibited near wild-type biological activity, most were defective in high affinity receptor binding. In particular, substitution of Glu-21 with alanine abrogated high affinity binding leaving low affinity binding unaffected. Despite near wild-type biological activity, no detectable binding interaction of this mutant with mGM-R beta in the context of mGM-R alpha beta was observed. Cross-linking studies showed an apparent interaction of this mutant protein with mGM-R alpha beta. The deficient receptor binding characteristics and near wild-type biological activity of this mutant protein demonstrate that mGM-CSF receptor activation can occur independently of high affinity binding, suggesting that conformational changes in the receptor induced by mGM-CSF binding generate an active ligand-receptor complex."
https://openalex.org/W1533709119,"The activation of phospholipase C by hormones and neurotransmitters activates a complex combination of Ca2+ release and accumulation by intracellular organelles. Previously, we demonstrated that, in some cell types, the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator, fura-2, can be loaded into intracellular, agonist-sensitive Ca2+ pools (Glennon, M. C., Bird, G. St. J., Kwan, C.-Y., and Putney, J. W., Jr. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 8230-8233). In the current study, we have attempted to exploit this phenomenon by employing digital fluorescence imaging of compartmentalized fura-2 to investigate the localization and function of the major intracellular sites of Ca2+ regulation in AR4-2J pancreatoma cells. By judicious use of a surface receptor agonist together with the Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitor, thapsigargin, cellular regions were identified whose behavior indicates that they contain the sites of agonist- and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-mediated intracellular Ca2+ release. These regions were located throughout the cell and may include the nuclear envelope. They were distinct in locus and behavior from two other regions, which counterstained with fluorescent markers for nuclei and mitochondria. Fura-2 in mitochondrial regions reported low resting levels of [Ca2+], and revealed that organelles in these regions accumulate and retain Ca2+ after agonist activation. These findings demonstrate that fluorescent Ca2+ indicators can be employed to directly monitor changes in [Ca2+] in the major Ca(2+)-regulating organelles, and provide the first in situ visualization and localization of the major sites of Ca2+ regulation in cells."
https://openalex.org/W1659637175,"Type I procollagen was purified from the medium of dermal fibroblasts cultured from four individuals with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) type II who had mutations in the COL1A1 gene of type I procollagen. The procollagens were mixtures of normal molecules and molecules that contained substitutions of aspartate for glycine 97, arginine for glycine 550, cysteine for glycine 718, and aspartate for glycine 883 in one or both of the alpha 1 (I) chains of the molecule. The procollagens were cleaved more slowly than control type I procollagen by procollagen N-proteinase. Double-reciprocal plots of initial relative velocities and initial substrate concentrations indicated that the OI procollagens were all cleaved slowly by N-proteinase because of decreased Vmax, rather than increased Km. This suggested that slow cleavage of the OI procollagens by N-proteinase was the result of slow conversion of the N-proteinase-procollagen complex. Further experiments showed that the vertebrate collagenase A fragment of the aspartate for glycine alpha 1(I) 883 OI procollagen that contained the N-proteinase cleavage site but not the site of the substitution was also cleaved more slowly by N-proteinase than the normal vertebrate collagenase A fragments in the samples. These data show, for the first time, that an altered triple-helical structure is propagated from the site of a substitution of a bulky residue for glycine to the amino-terminal end of the procollagen molecule and disrupts the conformation of the N-proteinase cleavage site. Rotary shadowing electron microscopy of molecules in the preparation of cysteine for glycine alpha 1(I)-718 showed the presence of a kink in approximately 5% of a population of molecules in which 60% were abnormal and 20% contained a disulfide bond. In contrast, procollagens containing aspartate and arginine for glycine were indistinguishable by rotary shadowing electron microscopy from those in control samples. The results here confirm previous suggestions that substitution of cysteine for glycine in the alpha 1(I) chain of type I collagen can introduce a kink near the site of the substitution. However, the presence of a kink is not a prerequisite for delayed cleavage of abnormal procollagens by N-proteinase."

https://openalex.org/W1500325310,"In bacteriorhodopsin Asp85 has been proposed to function both as a negative counterion to the Schiff base and as proton acceptor in the early stages of the photocycle. To test this proposal further, we have replaced Asp85 by His. The rationale for this replacement is that although His can function as a proton acceptor, it cannot provide a negative charge at residue 85 to serve as a counterion to the protonated Schiff base. We show here that the absorption spectrum of the D85H mutant is highly sensitive to the pH of the external medium. From spectroscopic titrations, we have determined the apparent pK for deprotonation of the Schiff base to be 8.8 +/- 0.1 and the apparent pK for protonation of the His85 side chain to be approximately 3.5. Between pH 3.5 and 8.8, where the Schiff base is protonated, and the His side chain is deprotonated, the D85H mutant is completely inactive in proton transport. Time-resolved studies show that there is no detectable formation of an M-like intermediate in the photocycle of the D85H mutant. These experiments show that the presence of a neutral proton-accepting moiety at residue 85 is not sufficient for carrying out light-driven proton transport. The requirements at residue 85 are therefore for a group that serves both as a negatively charged counterion and as a proton acceptor."

https://openalex.org/W1548073129,"The platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) A-chain gene is a developmentally regulated gene that is expressed in high levels in a limited number of normal and transformed cell lines and in cells stimulated by cytokines, including PDGF itself. We have now analyzed potential regulatory elements in 3.6 kilobase pairs (kb) of the 5'-flanking sequences of the human PDGF A-chain gene using reporter gene constructs and transient transfection analyses. The region between base pairs (bp) -618 and +392 (relative to the transcription initiation site) is sufficient for optimal promoter activity. A highly G + C region containing three contiguous Sp1 binding sites between bp -150 and -33 contributes over 80% of promotor activity. DNase I footprinting analyses indicates that Sp1 binds to and protects over 57 bp of this G + C region. A functional serum response element is located within bp -477 and -468 and positively regulates induction of PDGF A by PDGF. A negative regulatory (silencer) element is located from -1.9 to -0.9 kb. The results suggest that the major constitutive expression of the PDGF A-chain gene requires a highly G + C-rich region containing three Sp1 binding sites and that induction of the PDGF A-chain gene by PDGF is mediated by a SRE located at bp -477 to -468."
https://openalex.org/W1907364791,"The Escherichia coli rnt gene encoding the enzyme RNase T, which is responsible for the end-turnover of tRNA, was cloned on a 1.5-kilobase DNA fragment. When placed in pUC18 and pUC19 vectors this fragment led to approximately a 40-fold overexpression of RNase T activity. The cloned fragment was sequenced and was found to contain an open reading frame sufficient to encode a protein of 215 amino acids with a molecular weight of 23,521, which is close to the subunit molecular weight of RNase T; the fragment also contains a second incomplete open reading frame with some sequence similarity to RNA helicases. The derived sequence of RNase T showed no similarity to any of the other E. coli exoribonucleases sequenced to date. Primer extension analysis and deletion of part of the upstream region were used to identify the transcription start point and the promoter of the rnt gene. Northern and primer extension analysis revealed that the rnt message also included the second open reading frame, suggesting that rnt is part of an operon."

https://openalex.org/W2417409990,"Band q13 of chromosome 11 is frequently amplified in human breast cancers, but the gene(s) responsible for the emergence of this amplicon remain(s) elusive as yet. As a tribute to the complexity of the amplification events involving 11q13 sequences in human breast cancer, we have now studied a more telomeric region at 11q13.5-q14 defined by a new transcription unit, D11S833E. We have observed that amplicons present in cell lines and primary tumors amplified for both BCL1 and D11S833E could be interrupted between these two loci. Such discontinuities were demonstrated by using a probe for the KRN1 gene, which we have localized between the BCL1/FGF4 region and D11S833E. In fact, KRN1 was not present in 4 out of 10 amplicons bearing both BCL1 and D11S833E. Furthermore, we have observed tumors in which D11S833E could be amplified in the absence of amplification of other known markers of 11q13. Therefore, D11S833E defines a new and independent amplification unit in this region."

https://openalex.org/W136119468,"The initiator element of the adenovirus type 2 IVa2 promoter is sufficient to direct accurate initiation by RNA polymerase II. Analysis of the effects of substitution of specific base pairs on initiator activity in in vitro transcription systems indicated that specific sequences between positions -4 and +5 were essential for initiator activity. Mutations that impaired or eliminated initiator activity altered both base pairs that are conserved in sequence-related initiators and nonconserved sequences. Neither the downstream TA-rich sequence of the IVa2 promoter, nor the adenovirus 2 major late TATA element placed at the same downstream site could overcome the severe inhibitory effects of initiator mutations, indicating that the initiator is the primary determinant of the specificity and direction of IVa2 transcription. By contrast, when the ML TATA element was placed 31 nucleotides upstream of the IVa2 initiator, the precise specificity, but neither the efficiency nor direction of transcription, depended on the presence of a functional initiator. Activity of the IVa2 promoter was relatively insensitive to changes in the orientation or nature of the TA-rich sequence. Furthermore, only a promoter containing the ML TA-TAAAA sequence downstream of the IVa2 initiator was competent to direct both IVa2 transcription and transcription from the opposite strand. The implications of this functional difference for recognition of the downstream element are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1560223780,"Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae oligomycin sensitivity conferring proteins (OSCP) have been expressed in Escherichia coli. Heterologous expression results in production of a protein that is identical to yeast mature OSCP, including the absence of the initiating methionine residue. Yeast OSCP expressed in E. coli has been purified to homogeneity and it is able to reconstitute oligomycin-sensitive ATPase using purified F1- and F1/OSCP-depleted membranes (electron transport particles (ETP). Binding of F1 to ETP is dependent on the addition of OSCP. Binding studies using 35S-OSCP indicated that OSCP binds to ETP with a Kd of 200 nM and a capacity of 420 pmol/mg particle protein, whereas OSCP does not interact with F1 in the absence of ETP. These data indicate that yeast OSCP must first form a specific complex with F0, which then binds F1 forming the functional complex. To identify functional domains in yeast OSCP, two deletion mutants have been made. Antibodies directed to these deletion products do not inhibit OSCP-dependent binding of F1 to ETP. However, antibodies directed against the last one-third of OSCP greatly reduce the oligomycin sensitivity of the reconstituted ATPase. These data suggest that OSCP is involved in a functional role in energy transduction or proton translocation and serves a structural role in the yeast mitochondrial ATP synthase."

https://openalex.org/W1625046863,"Tubulin, widely recognized as a GTP/GDP-binding protein, has been isolated in its polymerized state from rat PC12 cells and embryonic chick dorsal root ganglion neurons by Triton X-100 detergent extraction of the cytoskeletal fraction. Perchloric acid extraction and deproteinization of this fraction permitted subsequent analysis of nucleotide identity and content by high performance liquid chromatography. PC12 cells grown in the absence of nerve growth factor (NGF) contained ADP, ATP, GDP, and GTP at levels consistent with the actin and tubulin content of the cytoskeletal fraction. Microtubules from PC12 cells cultured in the presence of NGF contain an additional nucleotide that we have identified as dGTP. Analysis of whole cell nucleotide extracts from PC12 cells grown in the absence or presence of NGF revealed no evidence for the presence of dGTP at 4 and 14 days, respectively. We have determined that embryonic chick dorsal root ganglion neurons also contain this deoxyribonucleotide, and we found virtually no ADP or ATP in the extracted dorsal root ganglion cytoskeletal fraction. On the basis of metabolic labeling studies with [14C] guanine, we have inferred that the presence of dGTP in NGF-treated PC12 cells probably arises either from binding to the nonexchangeable nucleotide site of tubulin undergoing dynamic assembly/disassembly or from binding to the exchangeable site of tubulin subsequently incorporated into highly stabilized microtubules."
