https://openalex.org/W2150740687,"Most normal mammalian cells have a finite lifespan, thought to constitute a protective mechanism against unlimited proliferation. This phenomenon, called senescence, is driven by telomere attrition, which triggers the induction of tumour suppressors including p16(INK4a) (ref. 5). In cultured cells, senescence can be elicited prematurely by oncogenes; however, whether such oncogene-induced senescence represents a physiological process has long been debated. Human naevi (moles) are benign tumours of melanocytes that frequently harbour oncogenic mutations (predominantly V600E, where valine is substituted for glutamic acid) in BRAF, a protein kinase and downstream effector of Ras. Nonetheless, naevi typically remain in a growth-arrested state for decades and only rarely progress into malignancy (melanoma). This raises the question of whether naevi undergo BRAF(V600E)-induced senescence. Here we show that sustained BRAF(V600E) expression in human melanocytes induces cell cycle arrest, which is accompanied by the induction of both p16(INK4a) and senescence-associated acidic beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-Gal) activity, a commonly used senescence marker. Validating these results in vivo, congenital naevi are invariably positive for SA-beta-Gal, demonstrating the presence of this classical senescence-associated marker in a largely growth-arrested, neoplastic human lesion. In growth-arrested melanocytes, both in vitro and in situ, we observed a marked mosaic induction of p16(INK4a), suggesting that factors other than p16(INK4a) contribute to protection against BRAF(V600E)-driven proliferation. Naevi do not appear to suffer from telomere attrition, arguing in favour of an active oncogene-driven senescence process, rather than a loss of replicative potential. Thus, both in vitro and in vivo, BRAF(V600E)-expressing melanocytes display classical hallmarks of senescence, suggesting that oncogene-induced senescence represents a genuine protective physiological process."
https://openalex.org/W1982395176,"Cellular senescence has been theorized to oppose neoplastic transformation triggered by activation of oncogenic pathways in vitro, but the relevance of senescence in vivo has not been established. The PTEN and p53 tumour suppressors are among the most commonly inactivated or mutated genes in human cancer including prostate cancer. Although they are functionally distinct, reciprocal cooperation has been proposed, as PTEN is thought to regulate p53 stability, and p53 to enhance PTEN transcription. Here we show that conditional inactivation of Trp53 in the mouse prostate fails to produce a tumour phenotype, whereas complete Pten inactivation in the prostate triggers non-lethal invasive prostate cancer after long latency. Strikingly, combined inactivation of Pten and Trp53 elicits invasive prostate cancer as early as 2 weeks after puberty and is invariably lethal by 7 months of age. Importantly, acute Pten inactivation induces growth arrest through the p53-dependent cellular senescence pathway both in vitro and in vivo, which can be fully rescued by combined loss of Trp53. Furthermore, we detected evidence of cellular senescence in specimens from early-stage human prostate cancer. Our results demonstrate the relevance of cellular senescence in restricting tumorigenesis in vivo and support a model for cooperative tumour suppression in which p53 is an essential failsafe protein of Pten-deficient tumours."
https://openalex.org/W2152041515,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are approximately 21-nucleotide-long RNA molecules regulating gene expression in multicellular eukaryotes. In metazoa, miRNAs act by imperfectly base-pairing with the 3' untranslated region of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and repressing protein accumulation by an unknown mechanism. We demonstrate that endogenous let-7 microribonucleoproteins (miRNPs) or the tethering of Argonaute (Ago) proteins to reporter mRNAs in human cells inhibit translation initiation. M(7)G-cap-independent translation is not subject to repression, suggesting that miRNPs interfere with recognition of the cap. Repressed mRNAs, Ago proteins, and miRNAs were all found to accumulate in processing bodies. We propose that localization of mRNAs to these structures is a consequence of translational repression."
https://openalex.org/W1990601349,"We describe a DNA sequencing technology in which a commonly available, inexpensive epifluorescence microscope is converted to rapid nonelectrophoretic DNA sequencing automation. We apply this technology to resequence an evolved strain of Escherichia coli at less than one error per million consensus bases. A cell-free, mate-paired library provided single DNA molecules that were amplified in parallel to 1-micrometer beads by emulsion polymerase chain reaction. Millions of beads were immobilized in a polyacrylamide gel and subjected to automated cycles of sequencing by ligation and four-color imaging. Cost per base was roughly one-ninth as much as that of conventional sequencing. Our protocols were implemented with off-the-shelf instrumentation and reagents."
https://openalex.org/W2065459990,"Functional imaging methods monitor neural activity by measuring hemodynamic signals. These are more closely related to local field potentials (LFPs) than to action potentials. We simultaneously recorded electrical and hemodynamic responses in the cat visual cortex. Increasing stimulus strength enhanced spiking activity, high-frequency LFP oscillations, and hemodynamic responses. With constant stimulus intensity, the hemodynamic response fluctuated; these fluctuations were only loosely related to action potential frequency but tightly correlated to the power of LFP oscillations in the gamma range. These oscillations increase with the synchrony of synaptic events, which suggests a close correlation between hemodynamic responses and neuronal synchronization."
https://openalex.org/W2048696618,"A simple genetic change liberated the naked kernel from the protective casing that envelops it in the maize progenitor, teosinte. With the kernel exposed on the surface of the ear it was readily utilized as a food source by humans. The domestication of maize was under way. The most critical step in maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) domestication was the liberation of the kernel from the hardened, protective casing that envelops the kernel in the maize progenitor, teosinte1. This evolutionary step exposed the kernel on the surface of the ear, such that it could readily be used by humans as a food source. Here we show that this key event in maize domestication is controlled by a single gene (teosinte glume architecture or tga1), belonging to the SBP-domain family2 of transcriptional regulators. The factor controlling the phenotypic difference between maize and teosinte maps to a 1-kilobase region, within which maize and teosinte show only seven fixed differences in their DNA sequences. One of these differences encodes a non-conservative amino acid substitution and may affect protein function, and the other six differences potentially affect gene regulation. Molecular evolution analyses show that this region was the target of selection during maize domestication. Our results demonstrate that modest genetic changes in single genes can induce dramatic changes in phenotype during domestication and evolution."

https://openalex.org/W2150565647,"In general, the formation and dissociation of solute-solvent complexes have been too rapid to measure without disturbing the thermal equilibrium. We were able to do so with the use of two-dimensional infrared vibrational echo spectroscopy, an ultrafast vibrational analog of two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The equilibrium dynamics of phenol complexation to benzene in a benzene-carbon tetrachloride solvent mixture were measured in real time by the appearance of off-diagonal peaks in the two-dimensional vibrational echo spectrum of the phenol hydroxyl stretch. The dissociation time constant tau(d) for the phenol-benzene complex was 8 picoseconds. Adding two electron-donating methyl groups to the benzene nearly tripled the value of tau(d) and stabilized the complex, whereas bromobenzene, with an electron-withdrawing bromo group, formed a slightly weaker complex with a slightly lower tau(d). The spectroscopic method holds promise for studying a wide variety of other fast chemical exchange processes."
https://openalex.org/W2103560494,"Bacterial microcompartments are primitive organelles composed entirely of protein subunits. Genomic sequence databases reveal the widespread occurrence of microcompartments across diverse microbes. The prototypical bacterial microcompartment is the carboxysome, a protein shell for sequestering carbon fixation reactions. We report three-dimensional crystal structures of multiple carboxysome shell proteins, revealing a hexameric unit as the basic microcompartment building block and showing how these hexamers assemble to form flat facets of the polyhedral shell. The structures suggest how molecular transport across the shell may be controlled and how structural variations might govern the assembly and architecture of these subcellular compartments."
https://openalex.org/W3206313421,"Protein O -mannosylation is an essential and evolutionarily conserved post-translational modification among eukaryotes. This form of protein modification is also described in Mycobacterium tuberculosis ; however, the mechanism of mannoprotein assembly remains unclear. Evaluation of differentially translocated chimeric proteins and mass spectrometry to monitor glycosylation demonstrated that specific translocation processes were required for protein O -mannosylation in M. tuberculosis . Additionally, Rv1002c, a M. tuberculosis membrane protein homolog of eukaryotic protein mannosyltransferases, was shown to catalyze the initial step of protein mannosylation. Thus, the process of protein mannosylation is conserved between M. tuberculosis and eukaryotic organisms."

https://openalex.org/W1963957834,"The brain keenly depends on glucose for energy, and mammalians have redundant systems to control glucose production. An increase in circulating glucose inhibits glucose production in the liver, but this negative feedback is impaired in type 2 diabetes. Here we report that a primary increase in hypothalamic glucose levels lowers blood glucose through inhibition of glucose production in rats. The effect of glucose requires its conversion to lactate followed by stimulation of pyruvate metabolism, which leads to activation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)–sensitive potassium channels. Thus, interventions designed to enhance the hypothalamic sensing of glucose may improve glucose homeostasis in diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W1984563220,"Recent experiments revealed large-scale differences in the transcription programs of related species, yet little is known about the genetic basis underlying the evolution of gene expression and its contribution to phenotypic diversity. Here we describe a large-scale modulation of the yeast transcription program that is connected to the emergence of the capacity for rapid anaerobic growth. Genes coding for mitochondrial and cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins display a strongly correlated expression pattern in Candida albicans, but this correlation is lost in the fermentative yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We provide evidence that this change in gene expression is connected to the loss of a specific cis-regulatory element from dozens of genes following the apparent whole-genome duplication event. Our results shed new light on the genetic mechanisms underlying the large-scale evolution of transcriptional networks."
https://openalex.org/W2086341268,"The newly recognized bacterial second messenger 3',5'-cyclic diguanylic acid (cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP)) has been shown to regulate a wide variety of bacterial behaviors and traits. Biosynthesis and degradation of c-di-GMP have been attributed to the GGDEF and EAL protein domains, respectively, based primarily on genetic evidence. Whereas the GGDEF domain was demonstrated to possess diguanylate cyclase activity in vitro, the EAL domain has not been tested directly for c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase activity. This study describes the analysis of c-di-GMP hydrolysis by an EAL domain protein in a purified system. The Vibrio cholerae EAL domain protein VieA has been shown to inversely regulate biofilm-specific genes (vps) and virulence genes (ctxA), presumably by decreasing the cellular pool of c-di-GMP. VieA was maximally active at neutral pH, physiological ionic strength, and ambient temperatures and demonstrated c-di-GMP hydrolytic activity with a Km of 0.06 microM. VieA was unable to hydrolyze cGMP. The putative metal coordination site of the EAL domain, Glu170, was demonstrated to be necessary for VieA activity. Furthermore, the divalent cations Mg2+ and Mn2+ were necessary for VieA activity; conversely, Ca2+ and Zn2+ were potent inhibitors of the VieA phosphodiesterase. Calcium inhibition of the VieA EAL domain provides a potential mechanism for regulation of c-di-GMP degradation."

https://openalex.org/W2069272306,"Percolation is a statistical concept that describes the formation of an infinite cluster of connected particles or pathways. Lowering the percolation threshold is a critical issue to achieve light and low-cost conductive composites made of an insulating matrix loaded with conductive particles. This has interest for applications where charge dissipation and electrical conductivity are sought in films, coatings, paints, or composite materials. One route to decreasing the loading required for percolation is to use rod-like particles. Theoretical predictions indicate that this may also be achieved by altering the interaction potential between the particles. Although percolation may not always respond monotonically to interactions, the use of adhesive rods can be expected to be an ideal combination. By using a system made of carbon nanotubes in an aqueous surfactant solution, we find that very small attraction can markedly lower the percolation threshold. The strength of this effect can thereby have direct technological interest and explain the large variability of experimental results in the literature dealing with the electrical behavior of composites loaded with conducting rods."
https://openalex.org/W2087413829,"Mammalian epidermis is maintained by self-renewal of stem cells, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Deletion of Rac1, a Rho guanosine triphosphatase, in adult mouse epidermis stimulated stem cells to divide and undergo terminal differentiation, leading to failure to maintain the interfollicular epidermis, hair follicles, and sebaceous glands. Rac1 exerts its effects in the epidermis by negatively regulating c-Myc through p21-activated kinase 2 (PAK2) phosphorylation. We conclude that a pleiotropic regulator of cell adhesion and the cytoskeleton plays a critical role in controlling exit from the stem cell niche and propose that Rac and Myc represent a global stem cell regulatory axis."
https://openalex.org/W2034752401,"Water-cluster anions can serve as a bridge to understand the transition from gaseous species to the bulk hydrated electron. However, debate continues regarding how the excess electron is bound in (H2O)-n, as an interior, bulklike, or surface electronic state. To address the uncertainty, the properties of (H2O)-n clusters with 20 to 200 water molecules have been evaluated by mixed quantum-classical simulations. The theory reproduces every observed energetic, spectral, and structural trend with cluster size that is seen in experimental photoelectron and optical absorption spectra. More important, surface states and interior states each manifest a characteristic signature in the simulation data. The results strongly support assignment of surface-bound electronic states to the water-cluster anions in published experimental studies thus far."
https://openalex.org/W2108204774,"The position of the cytokinesis furrow in a cell determines the relative sizes of its two daughter cells as well as the distribution of their contents. In animal cells, the position of the cytokinesis furrow is specified by the position of the mitotic spindle. The cytokinesis furrow bisects the spindle midway between the microtubule asters, at the site of the microtubule-based midzone, producing two daughter cells. Experiments in some cell types have suggested that the midzone positions the furrow, but experiments in other cells have suggested that the asters position the furrow. One possibility is that different organisms and cell types use different mechanisms to position the cytokinesis furrow. An alternative possibility is that both asters and the midzone contribute to furrow positioning. Recent work in C. elegans has suggested that centrosome separation and the midzone are implicated in cytokinesis. Here we examine the relative contributions of different parts of the mitotic spindle to positioning of the cytokinesis furrow in the C. elegans zygote. By spatially separating the spindle midzone from one of the asters using an ultraviolet laser, we show that the cytokinesis furrow is first positioned by a signal determined by microtubule asters, and then by a second signal that is derived from the spindle midzone. Thus, the position of the cytokinesis furrow is specified by two consecutive furrowing activities."
https://openalex.org/W2115744037,"Multimillion-atom molecular dynamics simulation of indentation of nanocrystalline silicon carbide reveals unusual deformation mechanisms in brittle nanophase materials, resulting from the coexistence of brittle grains and soft amorphous grain boundary phases. Simulations predict a crossover from intergranular continuous deformation to intragrain discrete deformation at a critical indentation depth. The crossover arises from the interplay between cooperative grain sliding, grain rotations, and intergranular dislocation formation similar to stick-slip behavior. The crossover is also manifested in switching from deformation dominated by indentation-induced crystallization to deformation dominated by disordering, leading to amorphization. This interplay between deformation mechanisms is critical for the design of ceramics with superior mechanical properties."

The Gclm(–/–) knock-out mouse shows tissue levels of GSH that are between 9 and 40% of the Gclm(+/+) wild-type mouse. In the present study, we used recombinant GCLC and GCLM and Gclm(–/–) mice to examine the role of GCLM on γ-GC synthesis by GCLholo. GCLM decreased the Km for ATP by ∼6-fold and, similar to other species, decreased the Km for glutamate and increased the Ki for feedback inhibition by GSH. Furthermore, GCLM increased by 4.4-fold the Kcat for γ-GC synthesis; this difference in catalytic efficiency of GCLholo versus GCLC allowed us to derive a mathematical relationship for γ-GC production and to determine the relative levels of GCLholo and GCLC; in homogenates of brain, liver, and lung, the ratio of GCLC to GCLholo was 7.0, 2.0, and 3.5, respectively. In kidney, however, the relationship between GCLC and GCLholo was complicated. Kidney contains GCLholo, free GCLC, and free GCLM, and free GCLC in kidney cannot interact with GCLM. Taken together, we conclude that, in most tissues, GCLM is limiting, suggesting that an increase in GCLM alone would increase γ-GC synthesis. On the other hand, our results from kidney suggest that γ-GC synthesis may be controlled post-translationally.

GSH is an abundant cellular antioxidant, being maintained at millimolar concentrations in most, if not all, cell types (1Kosower N.S. Kosower E.M. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1978; 54: 109-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar, 2Meister A. Anderson M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 711-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (5925) Google Scholar, 3Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17205-17208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the GSH concentration varies as much as 10-fold between different cell types, the concentration of GSH in a given cell type is quite consistent, unless modified by cellular redox reactions or perhaps external stimuli. Because of its elevated levels and high reduction potential, GSH together with GSSG are considered an important cellular redox couple (4Dalton T.P. Chen Y. Schneider S.N. Nebert D.W. Shertzer H.G. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 37: 1511-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), suggesting a role for GSH in specifying the cellular redox state. In addition, GSH is a cofactor for many enzymes, including the glutathione peroxidases and the glutathione S-transferases (5Arthur J.R. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1825-1835Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Rinaldi R. Eliasson E. Swedmark S. Morgenstern R. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2002; 30: 1053-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Thus, through enzymatic reactions, GSH is both directly and indirectly involved in the elimination of reactive oxygen metabolites. GSH is also a signaling molecule. It is added to proteins as a post-translational modification (7Pompella A. Visvikis A. Paolicchi A. De V, T. Casini A.F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 66: 1499-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). It interacts with nitric oxide to modify its bioavailability (8Hogg N. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

In conclusion, GSH is a multifunctional molecule with diverse and still emerging functions.GSH is a tripeptide that is synthesized by two successive enzymatic reactions. The first, ligation of glutamate and cysteine, is catalyzed by glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL) 2The abbreviations used are: GCL, glutamate cysteine ligase; γ-GC, γ-glutamylcysteine; GCLholo, GCL holoenzyme; FPLC, fast liquid protein chromatography; GCLa, GCL activity; GCLCb, GCLM-bound GCLC; GCLCf, free GCLC.2The abbreviations used are: GCL, glutamate cysteine ligase; γ-GC, γ-glutamylcysteine; GCLholo, GCL holoenzyme; FPLC, fast liquid protein chromatography; GCLa, GCL activity; GCLCb, GCLM-bound GCLC; GCLCf, free GCLC. and forms γ-glutamylcysteine (γ-GC). The second, coupling of γ-GC with glycine, is catalyzed by glutathione synthetase to form GSH. The rate-limiting step in GSH biosynthesis is catalyzed by GCL (2Meister A. Anderson M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 711-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (5925) Google Scholar). In its catalytically most active form, GCL is composed of a catalytic (GCLC) and a modifier (GCLM) subunit; these subunits are encoded by separate genes on different chromosomes. GCLC possesses the catalytic capacity for γ-GC formation. GCLM interacts with GCLC, making the holoenzyme (GCLholo) kinetically more efficient in γ-GC synthesis. Such roles for GCLC and GCLM have been suggested by experiments performed using knock-out mice (11Yang Y. Dieter M.Z. Chen Y. Shertzer H.G. Nebert D.W. Dalton T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49446-49452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Disruption of the Gclc gene is embryolethal. Cells harvested from a Gclc(–/–) blastocyst inner cell mass continue to grow in culture, however, in the presence of GSH or N-acetylcysteine. When Gclc(–/–) cells are cultured in N-acetylcysteine, GSH is below the detection limit of about 1 μm, suggesting that GSH may not be essential for cell survival (12Dalton T.P. Dieter M.Z. Yang Y.

Disruption of the Gclm gene in mice, on the other hand, leads to no overt phenotype. The tissues from Gclm(–/–) mice, however, exhibit low GSH levels, and cells derived from these mice are very sensitive to oxidant exposure.Studies examining the impact of GCLM on γ-GC synthesis have been conducted with the GCL enzyme, isolated or expressed from several species (11Yang Y.

For the rat, the GCLC Km for glutamate was determined to be 18.2 mm, 8.8-fold higher than the GCLholo and substantially higher than the cytoplasmic glutamate concentration in most tissues (14Huang C.S.

In contrast, the Km for glutamate has been demonstrated to be at or below the cellular glutamate concentration for partially purified or recombinant GCLholo from Drosophila, mice, or humans (11Yang Y.

Biophys. 1998; 354: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar); for these species, GCLM did not modify the Km for cysteine. The impact of GCLM on the Km for ATP has not been reported. Studies on GCLC from each of these species also demonstrate competitive inhibition of glutamate binding by GSH; such inhibition occurs in the low millimolar concentration range and may be particularly important in cell types that accumulate high GSH levels, such as those in liver and kidney. Such inhibition is partially alleviated by GCLM binding (11Yang Y. Dieter M.Z. Chen Y. Shertzer H.G. Nebert D.W. Dalton T.P. J. Biol.

Finally, under substrate saturation, there is conflicting evidence that GCLholo is catalytically more efficient than GCLC, possessing a higher Vmax (14Huang C.S. Chang L.S. Anderson M.E. Meister A.

In the present study, we employ recombinant GCLC, GCLM, and Gclm(–/–) mice to investigate the mechanisms and extent to which GCLM regulates GSH accumulation.MATERIALS AND METHODSChemicals—All chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Gclm(–/–) Mice—The generation of Gclm(–/–) mice has previously been described (11Yang Y. Dieter M.Z. Chen Y. Shertzer H.G. Nebert D.W. Dalton T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49446-49452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Gclm(+/+) and Gclm(–/–) were generated by crossing Gclm(+/–) mice. All animal experiments were conducted on littermates, and all studies were approved by the University of Cincinnati Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.Construction, Expression, and Purification of GCLC and GCLM—cDNAs for mouse GCLC and GCLM were amplified (35 cycles) using Deep Vent Polymerase (New England Biolabs; Beverly, MA) from C57BL6/J hepatic RNA, following reverse transcription using oligo(dT) and Superscript (Invitrogen). The cDNAs were cloned into pRSET vectors (Invitrogen) in frame with an N-terminal polyhistidine tag. Following transformation, the bacterium Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS, containing either the GCLC or GCLM cDNA, was induced for 2 h with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration 1 mm), and lysed (lysis buffer was 20 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm KCl, 10 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.9) by sonication. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 1 h, and the supernatant was applied to nickel resin (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Columns were washed with washing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm KCl, 30 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.9) and eluted with elution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm KCl, 300 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.9). Purified proteins, >95% homogeneous by Coomassie staining, were dialyzed overnight against dialysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2,and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.4) and stored in 25% glycerol at –20 °C until use.Tissue Homogenate Preparation—Tissue homogenates, as indicated, were prepared from freshly isolated tissue by homogenization in 9 volumes of homogenization buffer (154 mm KCl, 5 mm diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 m potassium phosphate, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 6.8) using a Teflon homogenizer and clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. If not used immediately, cytosolic fractions were frozen on dry ice and stored at –80 °C until use.Gel Filtration Chromatography—Tissue GCLholo, GCLC, and GCLM were separated by fast liquid protein chromatography (FPLC) as previously described (11Yang Y. Dieter M.Z. Chen Y. Shertzer H.G. Nebert D.W. Dalton T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49446-49452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 ml of tissue cytosolic fractions was applied to a HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S-100 High Resolution column pre-equilibrated with homogenization buffer, and protein was separated with homogenization buffer. Elution fractions (0.5 ml) were collected and used for GCL activity assay immediately or stored in –80 °C for Western immunoblot.PAGE and Western Immunoblot Analysis—Nondenaturing PAGE was conducted using a 7.5% separating gel cast using polyacrylamide and 1.5 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.8) and a 4% stacking gel cast using polyacryl-amide and 0.5 m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) as described (24Davis B.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 404-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (15919) Google Scholar); loading samples were prepared in 0.125 m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) and 7.5% glycerol. 12% denaturing SDS-PAGE was performed as previously described (25Weber K. Osborn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4406-4412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to resolve tissue cytosolic or FPLC fractions. Western immunoblot analysis for the GCLC and GCLM proteins was conducted using rabbit polyclonal anti-GCLC (1:30,000) and anti-GCLM(1:25,000), respectively, as previously described (11Yang Y.

Chem. 2002; 277: 49446-49452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar).Enzyme Activity and Kinetic Analysis—Reactions to form γ-GC from l-glutamate and l-cysteine were conducted at 37 °C in the standard assay buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm l-glutamate, 3 mm l-cysteine, and 10 mm ATP, pH 7.2). Such concentrations for individual substrates were selected to reach saturation. For Km and Ki studies, concentration series of individual substrates were used, with other components unchanged in the standard assay buffer, as described under “Results.” A fluorescent derivative of γ-GC was generated using o-phthaldehyde, and the derivative was separated from GSH and quantified, using high pressure liquid chromatography as previously described (11Yang Y. Dieter M.Z. Chen Y. Shertzer H.G. Nebert D.W. Dalton T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49446-49452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Kinetic constants were calculated using the Sigma Plot Enzyme Kinetics Module (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).Protein Quantification—Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad).Statistical Analysis—Statistical analyses were performed using SigmaStat Statistical Analysis software (SPSS). All data are reported as the means ± S.E.RESULTSIn Vitro Formation of Holo-GCL—Mouse GCLC and GCLM proteins, containing polyhistidine tags, were expressed in E. coli, and each was purified to near homogeneity by affinity chromatography. GCLC is catalytically active in the formation of γ-GC, whereas GCLM is not. Interaction between GCLC and GCLM forms a heterodimeric complex, which hereafter is referred to as GCLholo. To compare the catalytic characteristics of GCLC and GCLholo, we first must demonstrate the efficient formation of the heterodimeric GCLholo complex. For this purpose, we added increasing amounts of GCLM to GCLC and followed the formation of the complex by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were identified by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 1a). GCLM (30.5 kDa; isoelectric point 5.19) migrated most rapidly and was clearly separated from GCLC (72.6 kDa; isoelectric point 5.73). Upon the addition of GCLM to GCLC, a more slowly migrating complex was formed, probably representing GCLholo; antibodies to either GCLM or GCLC recognized this complex and confirmed its identity (Fig. 1b). Immunoblots for GCLC demonstrated that increasing GCLM led to the apparent stoichiometric formation of GCLholo, and, based on protein quantification, the complex included GCLC and GCLM in equimolar amounts. The enzyme kinetic data below were determined for GCLholo formed, using twice the amount of GCLM necessary for the loss of GCLC, as detected by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting.Kinetics of γ-GC Formation by GCLC Versus GCLholo—The Michaelis constants of GCLC and GCLholo were compared for all three substrates, cysteine, glutamate, and ATP (TABLE ONE). The Km for cysteine did not significantly differ between GCLC and GCLholo and was similar to the value previously reported (11Yang Y. Dieter M.Z. Chen Y. Shertzer H.G. Nebert D.W. Dalton T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49446-49452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Increasing glutamate, with saturating ATP and cysteine concentrations, showed saturation kinetics with both GCLC and GCLholo (data not shown). The Km for glutamate, under linear initial rate conditions, was 3-fold greater for GCLC than for GCLholo. Increasing ATP, with saturating glutamate and cysteine concentrations, showed saturation kinetics for GCLholo. On the other hand, supraphysiological concentrations of ATP (>10 mm) were inhibitory toward catalysis by GCLC (data not shown); the mechanism for this effect was not determined, because it was judged not to be physiologically relevant. Remarkably, the Km of ATP was higher (5.7-fold) for GCLC than GCLholo.TABLE ONEKinetic constants for mouse GCL and GCLCEnzymeVmaxKcatKmKcat/Kml-Cysl-GluATPl-GluATPμmol/min/mgs-1mms-1 mm-1GCLholo6.8 ± 0.18.2 ± 0.10.22 ± 0.30.48 ± 0.10.87 ± 0.117.1 ± 0.19.5 ± 0.1GCLC1.54 ± 0.11.9 ± 0.10.27 ± 0.11.6 ± 0.35.0 ± 0.41.2 ± 0.10.4 ± 0.02 Open table in a new tab Inhibition of GCLC Versus GCLholo by GSH—GSH is known to be a feedback inhibitor of GCL (26Seelig G.F. Simondsen R.P. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9345-9347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We determined the dissociation constants (Ki) for GSH on GCLC and on GCLholo with regard to glutamate and ATP (TABLE TWO). The inhibition pattern for GSH on GCLC and GCLholo, with regard to both substrates, best fits a pattern of noncompetitive inhibition, where GSH binds to free enzyme with a dissociation constant Kis and to substrate bound enzyme with a dissociation constant Kii. With respect to glutamate, the Kis and Kii were 2.7- and 4-fold greater for GCLholo than GCLC. With respect to ATP, the Kis and Kii were 5- and 10-fold greater for GCLholo than GCLC. To validate these kinetic constants and models, we calculated the percentage inhibition of GCL activity by GSH at different substrate concentrations for GCLC or GCLholo, using the following equation for noncompetitive inhibition (27Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12185) Google Scholar). (V/Vmax)=[S]Km(1+([I]/Kis))+[S]((1+([I]/Kii))(Eq. 1) In the equation, [I] represents inhibitor (GSH) concentration, Kis and Kii are the dissociation constants (from TABLE TWO), [S] is substrate concentration, and Km is the Michaelis constant for glutamate or ATP (from TABLE ONE). The resulting predicted value agreed well with the experimentally obtained data (±12%), which supports the validity of the above determined inhibition patterns by GSH for both GCLC and GCLholo. To provide an appreciation of the relative catalytic contribution of GCLC relative to GCLholo under physiological substrate (glutamate or ATP) and inhibitor (GSH) concentrations, we calculated the activities of GCLC and GCLholo with concentrations 2–20 mm for glutamate, 1–6 mm for ATP, and 1–7 mm for GSH using above equation. Under these conditions, the calculated GCLC activity was only 2–8% that of GCLholo. Thus, compared with GCLholo, GCLC is very inefficient in γ-GC synthesis.TABLE TWODetermination of Ki of GSHEnzymeKiGSH)l-Glu (noncompetitive)ATP (noncompetitive)KisKiiKisKiimmGCLholo0.8 ± 0.23.1 ± 0.56.5 ± 1.43.9 ± 1.1GCLC0.3 ± 0.10.8 ± 0.21.3 ± 0.20.4 ± 0.1 Open table in a new tab Catalytic Efficiency of GCLC Versus GCLholo—GCLM exerts a marked effect on GCLholo by increasing the maximal rate at which γ-GC is produced. At a fixed GCLC amount upon the addition of GCLM, the production of γ-GC, under substrate saturation, increased to a maximal 4.4 ± 0.1-fold (Fig. 2a); this increase in product formation was reflected as an increase in the maximal velocity for GCLholo, relative to GCLC (TABLE ONE). Kcat/Km, a measure of the catalytic efficiency of an enzyme, is about 14-fold higher with respect to glutamate and 24-fold higher with respect to ATP for GCLholo than GCLC (TABLE ONE).FIGURE 2GCLM interacts with GCLC to increase the velocity of γ-GC formation.

Resulting mixtures were assayed for γ-GC formation at substrate saturation. a, the -fold increase in γ-GC formation, compared with that of GCLC alone. Data represent the means ± S.E. of triplicate determinations. b, the observed values for -fold increase of γ-GC formation (ordinate) were plotted against the theoretical values (abscissa) at GCLM/GCLC molar ratios of 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, and 1.0.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Using GCLM Complementation to Determine GCLC and GCLholo Concentrations—The sizeable difference in Kcat between GCLC and GCLholo may allow determination of the relative proportion of GCLC and GCLholo, in a given tissue or cell type, by confirming the following relationship. By definition, the GCL activity (GCLa) under substrate saturation is the sum of the activities of GCLC and GCLholo, or as follows. GCLa=GCLC+GCLholo(Eq. 2) For purposes of clarity, GCLC can be viewed as existing in two discrete pools: free GCLC (GCLCf) and GCLM-bound GCLC (GCLCb). In this case, the activity represented by GCLholo is equal to 4.4[GCLCb], representing the activity increase of GCLholo, where the constant 4.4 is equal to the -fold increase in γ-GC synthetic capacity observed when GCLM binds GCLC. Thus, the following is true. GCLa=GCLCf+4.4[GCLCb](Eq. 3) The total GCL activity (GCLtot) when all GCLC is bound with GCLM is as follows. GCLtot=4.4[GCLCf]+4.4[GCLCb](Eq. 4) Combining Equations 3 and 4, we have the following, GCLtot=4.4[GCLCf]+GCLa-GCLCf(Eq. 5) and the activity attributed to GCLCf is as follows. GCLCf=(GCLtot-GCLa)/3.4(Eq. 6) Furthermore, the activity contributed by GCLCb from Equation 3 is as follows. GCLCb=(GCLa-GCLCf)/4.4(Eq. 7) Therefore, in theory, by determining the activity of an enzyme preparation before and after complementation with GCLM, one may derive the relative proportions of GCLC and GCLholo. To test the validity of this relationship, we compared the activity of recombinant GCLC/GCLholo mixtures using recombinant enzymes (Fig. 2a) with the theoretical activity calculated using the molar ratio of GCLM added and the anticipated increase in activity using the equations above (Fig. 2b). The observed values were highly correlated (r2 = 0.95) with the theoretical values.Complementation of Tissue Cytosols from Gclm(–/–) Mice Using GCLM—The use of the mathematical relationship described above to determine the relative levels of GCLC and GCLholo in cells or tissues depends on the assumption that complementation of tissue extracts with GCLM results in activity increases that approach a 4.4-fold maximum, compared with extracts devoid of GCLM. Because we previously had generated the Gclm(–/–) knock-out mouse (11Yang Y. Dieter M.Z. Chen Y. Shertzer H.G. Nebert D.W. Dalton T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49446-49452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), we are in a position to test this possibility. In these analyses, we used tissue cytosolic fractions isolated from Gclm(–/–) mice and measured γ-GC synthesis, following titration with GCLM (Fig. 3a). Of the tissues selected, liver and kidney have the highest levels of GSH and GCL among tissues surveyed, and lung and brain have relatively low levels (Fig. 3b). In all tissues, the addition of GCLM led to a dose-dependent increase in GCL activity, which was saturable. Also, as expected, the amount of GCLM needed for maximal GCL activity was considerably less with lung or brain cytosol, compared with liver or kidney cytosol. Liver, lung, and brain cytosol, when saturated with GCLM, showed 4.3-, 4.6-, and 4.3-fold increases, respectively; these values are not significantly different from that found with recombinant GCLC (Fig. 2a; TABLE ONE). On the other hand, saturation of GCLC from kidney cytosol resulted in only a 3.6-fold increase in activity. Thus, in many but not all tissues, GCLC shows an increase in catalytic efficiency similar to that with recombinant GCLC.FIGURE 3Complementation of tissue cytosolic fractions, using recombinant GCLM. a, tissue cytosols (1 mg of protein) from Gclm(–/–) mice were mixed with increasing amounts of recombinant GCLM and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min and assayed for γ-GC formation at saturating substrate concentrations.

In these analyses, cytosolic extracts were prepared from tissues derived from wild-type mice and assayed for γ-GC formation at saturating substrate concentrations. Parallel assays were complemented with GCLM and similarly assayed. The results in Fig. 3c show that γ-GC production increased significantly with GCLM complementation in all tissue"

At submicromolar concentrations, 18:3 NAE, 18:2 NAE, and 18:1 NAE, but not 18:0 NAE and oleic acid, activate native rTRPV1 on perivascular sensory nerves. 18:1 NAE does not activate these nerves in TRPV1 gene knock-out mice. Only the unsaturated C18 NAEs elicit whole cell currents and fluorometric calcium responses in HEK293 cells expressing hTRPV1. Molecular modeling revealed a low energy cluster of U-shaped unsaturated NAE conformers, sharing several pharmacophoric elements with capsaicin. Furthermore, one of the two major low energy conformational families of anandamide also overlaps with the cannabinoid CB1 receptor ligand HU210, which is in line with anandamide being a dual activator of TRPV1 and the cannabinoid CB1 receptor. This study shows that several endogenous non-cannabinoid NAEs, many of which are more abundant than anandamide in rat tissues, activate TRPV1 and thus may play a role as endogenous TRPV1 modulators.

Pharmacol. 2004; 500: 351-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The present study examines the possibility that TRPV1 is also activated by similar endogenous long chain NAEs. One such lipid, N-oleoylethanolamine (18:1 NAE), is more abundant than anandamide in many tissues (24.Schmid H.H. Schmid P.C. Berdyshev E.V. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2002; 121: 111-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), but considerably less active than anandamide at the cannabinoid CB1 receptor (25.Sheskin T. Hanus L. Slager J. Vogel Z.

This lipid excites rodent sensory neurons in culture and heterologously expressed rTRPV1 in the presence of the protein kinase C activator phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (27.Ahern G. J. Biol.

Physiol. 2005; 564: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Furthermore, 18:1 NAE and N-stearoylethanolamine (18:0 NAE) both enhance anandamide-induced calcium responses in HEK293 cells expressing hTRPV1 (29.Smart D. Jonsson K.O. Vandevoorde S. Lambert D.M. Fowler C.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 136: 452-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar).In the present study, we have examined the effects of naturally occurring C18 NAEs on native TRPV1 in rodent blood vessels and the cloned hTRPV1 expressed in HEK293 cells. Activation of TRPV1 on perivascular sensory nerves in rat and mouse mesenteric arteries causes release of the potent vasodilator calcitonin gene-related peptide, the effect of which can be conveniently recorded in a preconstricted arterial segment (20.Zygmunt P.M. Petersson J. Andersson D.A. Chuang H. Sorgard M. Di Marzo V. Julius D. Högestätt E.D. Nature. 1999; 400: 452-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1844) Google Scholar, 30.Zygmunt P.M. Andersson D.A. Högestätt E.D. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4720-4727Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The flexible structures of NAEs differ greatly from the more rigid structures of capsaicin and the tricyclic cannabinoids. To gain insight into common structural features of these compounds, we used computational techniques to compare low energy conformations of NAEs and their putative pharmacophoric elements with those of the reference TRPV1 and cannabinoid CB1 receptor activators capsaicin and HU210, respectively.MATERIALS AND METHODSQuantification of NAEs—Rat dorsal root ganglia from all spinal levels and the mesenteric arterial bed were homogenized in 500 μl of Tris buffer (10 mm Tris base, 0.3 mm ascorbic acid, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.6). Methylarachidonylfluorophosphonate (1 μm) was included in the buffer to reduce degradation of NAEs. Ice-cold acetone (2.5 ml) with 0.1 μm [2H8]anandamide (internal standard) and 0.3 mm ascorbic acid (antioxidant) was added to extract lipids. Standards for quantifications were obtained by addition of different amounts of the N-acylethanolamines to homogenates of dorsal root ganglia and mesenteric arterial bed, respectively. After centrifugation at 3000 rpm in 10 min (5 °C), the supernatant was collected in polypropylene tubes and vacuum-evaporated. The extraction residue was reconstituted in 100 μl of methanol with 0.3 mm ascorbic acid and stored at -20 °C until analysis. The protein content of the pellet was determined with Coomassie Blue (Pierce) protein assay, using bovine serum albumin as a standard.A Perkin Elmer Series 200 liquid chromatography system with autosampler (Applied Biosystems, Norfolk, CT), coupled to an API 3000 LC-MS-MS (Applied Biosystems/MDS-SCIEX, Toronto, Canada) was used for the analysis. The column was a Genesis C8 (20 × 2.1 mm) with a particle size of 4 μm (Jones, Lakewood, CO). Aliquots of 5 μl were injected by the autosampler. Mobile phase was a water-methanol gradient containing 0.5% acetic acid, and the initial mobile flow was 75% methanol. A linear gradient to 100% methanol was applied in 6 min. The mobile flow rate was 0.2 ml/min. The turbo ion spray interface was set to 370 °C, the declustering potential 40 volts and collision energy 35 volts. The analyses were performed in the positive ion multiple reaction monitoring mode, and the mass fragments used were for anandamide, m/z 348.2/61.6; for [2H8]anandamide, m/z 356.4/62.2; for 22:4 NAE, m/z 376.3/61.6; for 18:3 NAE, m/z 322.3/61.6; for 18:2 NAE, m/z 324.3/61.6; for 18:1 NAE, m/z 326.3/61.6; and for 18:0 NAE, m/z 328.3/61.6. The peak area ratios between the analytes and the internal standards were used for quantification. The within-day precision at 10 and 100 nm, respectively, were 4 and 7% for anandamide, 10 and 13% for 22:4 NAE, 6 and 7% for 18:3 NAE, 6 and 7% for 18:2 NAE, 10 and 12% for 18:1 NAE, and 21 and 9% for 18:0 NAE.Recording of Vasorelaxation—Wistar-Hannover rats (250 g) of female gender and C57 BL/6 mice (30 gm) of either sex were killed by exsanguination under CO2 anesthesia. TRPV1-deficient mice (16.Caterina M.J. Leffler A. Malmberg A.B. Martin W.J. Trafton J. Petersen-Zeitz K.R. Koltzenburg M. Basbaum A.I. Julius D. Science. 2000; 288: 306-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (2868) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Prof. David Julius, UCSF. The first or second generation branches of the mesenteric artery was carefully dissected and flushed with physiological salt solution (composition in mm: NaCl 119, KCl 4.6, CaCl2 1.5, MgCl2 1.2, NaHCO3 15, NaH2PO4 1.2, and glucose 6). Ring segments, ∼2-mm long, were suspended between two stainless wires in tissue baths, containing physiological salt solution. One of the wires was connected to a force-displacement transducer (model FT03C, Grass Instruments) for isometric tension recording. The physiological salt solution was continuously bubbled with carbogen (95% O2 and 5% CO2), resulting in a pH of 7.4.The vessel segments were allowed to equilibrate for 1 h under a passive load of 1 mN and 2 mN for mouse and rat mesenteric arteries, respectively. Arteries were contracted with 3 μm phenylephrine to induce stable and submaximal contractions. Increasing concentrations of test drugs were added cumulatively to determine concentration-response relationships. Relaxant responses are expressed as percentage reversal of the phenylephrine-induced contraction. All experiments were performed at 37 °C in the presence of 3 mm NG-nitro-l-arginine and 10 μm indomethacin as previously described (20.Zygmunt P.M. Petersson J. Andersson D.A. Chuang H. Sorgard M. Di Marzo V. Julius D. Högestätt E.D. Nature. 1999; 400: 452-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1844) Google Scholar, 30.Zygmunt P.M. Andersson D.A. Högestätt E.D. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4720-4727Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some arteries were pretreated with 10 μm capsaicin for 60 min to cause desensitization and/or neurotransmitter depletion of sensory nerves. Capsaicin, capsazepine, and the NAEs were dissolved in ethanol and added cumulatively to the organ baths in volume of 2.5 μl. The final ethanol concentration in the organ bath never exceeded 1%. The incubation time with capsazepine was 20 min.Electrophysiology—HEK293 cells were transfected with hTRPV1 cDNA, kindly provided by Dr. Sven-Eric Jordt (UCSF), using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Inc.). After 24 h, whole cell currents were recorded at a holding potential of -50 mV. The bath solution contained (in mm): NaCl 140, KCl 5, MgCl2 2, glucose 10, and TES 10 adjusted to pH 7.4. The pipette solution contained (in mm): CsCl 140, EGTA 5, and TES 10 adjusted to pH 7.4. All experiments were carried out at room temperature (20-22 °C). The test drugs were dissolved in ethanol. The final ethanol concentration in the bath solution never exceeded 0.2%. Responses are calculated as a percentage of the response to 2 μm capsaicin.

Pharmacol. 2003; 478: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar.Fluorometric Calcium Imaging—HEK293 cells were transfected with hTRPV1 cDNA as described above. After 24 h, transfected cells were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated 384-well optiplates (Corning) at a density of ∼40,000 cells/well and were allowed to proliferate for 24 h. Prior to start of the assay, the cells were incubated with 2 μm fluo-4/AM for 30 min at 37 °C. Dye not taken up by cells was removed by aspiration followed by washing three times with 25 μl of a HEPES-buffered ringer solution (composition in mm: NaCl 145, KCl 5, MgCl2 1, CaCl2 1, and HEPES 10 adjusted to pH 7.4). The assay was performed in the HEPES-buffered ringer solution at room temperature. Fluorescence measurements were performed at 1-s intervals using a 384-well fluorometric imaging plate reader (FLIPR; Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Cellular responses were quantitated by calculating the difference between peak increases in fluorescence over baseline. Responses are calculated as a percentage of the response to a saturating concentration of anandamide (100 μm). The lipids were dissolved in ethanol. The final concentration of ethanol in the wells was 0.05% in all experiments.Calculations and Statistics—The -log of the agonist concentration eliciting half-maximal response (pEC50) was determined by nonlinear regression (GraphPad Prism 3.0). Emax refers to the maximal response achieved. When the concentration-response curve did not reach a plateau, and hence Emax and EC50 could not be determined, the area under curve (AUC) was calculated (GraphPad Prism version 3.0) and used for evaluation of drug effects. Two-tailed, unpaired Student's t test or analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunnett's post hoc test (GraphPad Prism 3.0) was used for statistical comparison. The content of NAEs is expressed as mol per mg protein. These values were log-transformed before statistical comparison, using ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni's post hoc test (GraphPad Prism 3.0). Statistical significance was accepted when the p value was less than 0.05.Molecular Modeling—Monte Carlo conformational searches, using the MacroModel (32.Mohamadi F. Richards N.G.J. Guida W.C. Liskamp R. Lipton M. Caulfield C. Chang G. Hendrickson T. Still W.C. J. Comput. Chem. 1990; 11: 440-467Crossref Scopus (3923) Google Scholar) suite of software (version 8.6), were conducted to identify low energy families of conformers within 3 kcal/mol of the global energy minimum of each compound in water. Non-bonded interactions within 8 Å for van der Waals interactions and 20 Å for electrostatic interactions were included in the calculations. The XCluster (33.Shenkin P.S. McDonald D.Q. J. Comput. Chem. 1994; 15: 899-916Crossref Scopus (207) Google Scholar) program implemented in the MacroModel package was used to group C18 NAEs, 20:4 NAE, capsaicin, and HU210 into geometrically similar families. The MacroModel software (version 8.6) was used to find optimal alignments, i.e. the minimum root mean square deviation (RMSD) between the pharmacophoric elements (see supplementary data for further details).Drugs—Anandamide (20:4 NAE; N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-5Z,8Z,11Z, 14Z-eicosatetraenamide), [2H8]anandamide, N-linolenoylethanolamine (18:3 NAE; N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-9Z,12Z,15Z-octadecatrienamide), N-linoleoylethanolamine (18:2 NAE; N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-9Z,12Z-octadecadienamide), methylarachidonylfluorophosphonate, oleic acid, N-oleoylethanolamine (18:1 NAE; N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-9Z-octadecenamide), and N-stearoylethanolamine (18:0 NAE; N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-octadecanamide) were purchased from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI). N-Docosatetraenylethanolamine (22:4 NAE; N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z-docosatetraenamide) were obtained from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Capsaicin and capsazepine were purchased from Tocris (Bristol, UK). NG-nitro-l-arginine, phenylephrine, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol, Trisbase, and HEPES were purchased from Sigma. Indomethacin (Confortide) was obtained from Dumex (Copenhagen, Denmark).RESULTSThe amounts of NAEs in the rat mesenteric artery and dorsal root ganglia were measured by LC-MS-MS (TABLE ONE). The levels of 18:2 NAE, 18:1 NAE, and 18:0 NAE in the mesenteric artery are 24, 20, and 26 times higher, respectively, compared with anandamide (p < 0.001, n = 12). No differences could be detected between the amounts of 22:4 NAE and 18:3 NAE compared with anandamide. The levels of 18:1 NAE and 18:0 NAE in dorsal root ganglia are 7 and 8 times higher, respectively, compared with anandamide (p < 0.001, n = 12). The amount of anandamide was 37 times higher than 18:3 NAE (p < 0.001), whereas no differences were detected between the levels of anandamide compared with 22:4 NAE and 18:2 NAE (n = 12).TABLE ONEContent of NAEs in rat mesenteric arteries and dorsal root gangliaNAEMesenteric arteriesDorsal root gangliapmol/mg proteinpmol/mg protein22:4 NAE2.1 ± 0.73.2 ± 0.820:4 NAE0.8 ± 0.26.0 ± 1.718:3 NAE1.5 ± 0.50.16 ± 0.0618:2 NAE19 ± 63.2 ± 0.918:1 NAE16 ± 442 ± 1318:0 NAE21 ± 646 ± 14 Open table in a new tab The unsaturated C18 NAEs N-linolenoylethanolamine (18:3 NAE), N-linoleoylethanolamine (18:2 NAE), and N-oleoylethanolamine (18:1 NAE) all induce a concentration-dependent relaxation in the rat mesenteric artery. Oleic acid at a concentration of 10 μm is unable to cause a relaxation in this artery (TABLE TWO), which excludes that oleic acid formed by hydrolytic cleavage of 18:1 NAE is responsible for the vasodilator response to this NAE. The relaxation induced by these unsaturated NAEs are inhibited by the TRPV1 receptor antagonist capsazepine in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1, A-C) and absent in arteries pretreated with the neurotoxin capsaicin (10 μm for 60 min; Fig. 1E). The pEC50 values in the absence and presence of capsazepine 1 μm are 6.3 ± 0.0 and 5.5 ± 0.1 (p < 0.0001) for 18:3 NAE, 6.2 ± 0.1 and 5.4 ± 0.3 (p = 0.01) for 18:2 NAE, and 6.4 ± 0.1 and 6.0 ± 0.1 (p = 0.03) for 18:1 NAE, respectively (n = 6). The presence of capsazepine 1 μm does not influence Emax for these lipids. The Emax values in the absence and presence of capsazepine 1 μm are 99 ± 0.6% and 95 ± 2% (18:3 NAE), 96 ± 2% and 83 ± 9% (18:2 NAE), and 98 ± 1% and 86 ± 6% (18:1 NAE), respectively. The AUC values in the absence and presence of capsazepine 3 μm are 203 ± 14 and 271 ± 19 (p = 0.02), for 18:3 NAE, 190 ± 7 and 276 ± 7(p < 0.0001), for 18:2 NAE, and 198 ± 11 and 290 ± 5 (p < 0.0001) for 18:1 NAE, respectively (n = 6-8).TABLE TWOStructure-activity relationship of N-acylethanolamines– Not analyzed.a The -log of the agonist concentration eliciting half-maximal responseb The maximal relaxation achievedc The maximal current as a percentage of capsaicin 2 μmd The maximal increase in fluorescence as a percentage of anandamide 100 μm* p < 0.05 compared to anandamide** p < 0.001 compared to anandamide Open table in a new tab N-Docosatetraenoylethanolamine (22:4 NAE), which has a longer fatty acid chain than anandamide (20:4 NAE), is also able to cause a capsazepine-sensitive relaxation in the rat mesenteric artery. The pEC50 values for 22:4 NAE are 6.8 ± 0.1 in the absence and 6.1 ± 0.1 in the presence of 1 μm capsazepine (p < 0.001, n = 6). The Emax values for 22:4 NAE are 94 ± 4% in the absence and 83 ± 7% in the presence of 1 μm capsazepine, respectively (n = 6). The AUC values in the absence and presence of capsazepine 3 μm are 172 ± 10 and 298 ± 2(p < 0.0001) for 22:4 NAE, respectively (n = 5).The saturated 18:0 NAE N-stearoylethanolamine can neither cause relaxation (Fig. 1D) nor enhance the relaxation induced by the TRPV1 receptor agonist anandamide. The pEC50 and Emax values for anandamide are 6.7 ± 0.1 and 96 ± 1% in the absence and 6.9 ± 0.1 and 96 ± 1% in the presence of 18:0 NAE, respectively (n = 6).N-Oleoylethanolamine (18:1 NAE) also induces relaxation in segments of the mouse mesenteric artery (Fig. 1F). This relaxation is almost absent in arteries from TRPV1-/- mice (Fig. 1F); Emax values are 9 ± 4% and 70 ± 5% in TRPV1-/- and TRPV1+/+ mice, respectively (p < 0.0001, n = 4). The ability of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (10 μm) to relax these arteries (Fig. 1F) indicates that the sensory nerves are functionally intact in TRPV1-/- mice (30.Zygmunt P.M. Andersson D.A. Högestätt E.D. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4720-4727Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Unsaturated 18 NAEs evoke concentration-dependent inward whole cell membrane currents in HEK293 cells expressing hTRPV1 (Fig. 2). The pEC50 and Emax values are shown in TABLE TWO. Of all capsaicin-sensitive cells examined, 59% responded to the unsaturated NAEs, whereas 18:0 NAE and oleic acid were inactive (Fig. 2). The magnitude of the maximum response to unsaturated NAEs is 577 ± 109 pA (10 μm 18:1 NAE, n = 21), 795 ± 161 pA (10 μm 18:2 NAE, n = 15) and 599 ± 109 pA (10 μm 18:3 NAE, n = 15). The capsaicin response amounts to 1114 ± 107 pA (2 μm capsaicin, n = 42). As shown in Fig. 2, capsazepine (3 μm) inhibits currents elicited by the unsaturated NAEs (10 μm) by 95 ± 5% (18:1 NAE, n = 3), 85 ± 8% (18:2 NAE, n = 3), and 95 ± 0% (18:3 NAE, n = 3).FIGURE 2Unsaturated C18 N-acylethanolamines are activators of human TRPV1. Whole cell currents were measured in HEK293 cells expressing human TRPV1, at a holding potential of -50 mV in calcium-free conditions. A, traces show concentration-dependent currents elicited by N-oleoylethanolamine (18:1 NAE), N-linoleoylethanolamine (18:2 NAE), and N-linolenoylethanolamine (18:3 NAE). Data in concentration-response curves are expressed as percent of the response evoked by 2μm capsaicin (CAP)(n = 7, 4 and 6 for 18:1 NAE, 18:2 NAE, and 18:3 NAE, respectively). B, traces show the inhibitory effect of the TRPV1 antagonist capsazepine (Cz) on currents evoked by the highest concentration tested of unsaturated C18 N-acylethanolamines. C and D, applications of capsaicin (CAP,2 μm), 18:1 NAE, (10 μm), and 18:2 NAE (10 μm) produce robust inward currents, whereas N-stearoylethanolamine (18:0 NAE, 10 μm) and oleic acid (OA, 10 μm) fail to evoke such currents.

The pEC50 and Emax values obtained in these experiments are shown in TABLE TWO.FIGURE 3Unsaturated N-acylethanolamines are activators of human TRPV1.

The multitude of unique minima found in these systems (1783 for NAE 18:0, 600 for NAE 18:1, 1604 for NAE 18:2, 2217 for NAE 18:3, and 2485 for NAE 20:4) are, as a consequence of their great flexibility, not all structurally distinct.

Activation of ERK1/2 and high ROS levels stabilize Ha-Ras protein, by inhibiting proteasomal degradation. We found a remarkable example in vivo of amplification of this circuitry in fibroblasts derived from systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) lesions, producing vast excess of ROS and undergoing rapid senescence. High ROS, Ha-Ras, and active ERK1/2 stimulated collagen synthesis, DNA damage, and accelerated senescence. Conversely ROS or Ras inhibition interrupted the signaling cascade and restored the normal phenotype.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3337-3345Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Ras isoforms in higher eukaryotes are uncoupled from cAMP-PKA signaling, and control many aspects of redox metabolism. We and others have presented data showing that Ha-Ras induced production of superoxide by stimulating the membrane NADPH oxidase complex via ERK1/2 (6Irani K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Sollott S.J. Der C.J.

On the other hand, we have found that Ki-Ras-stimulated mitochondrial MnSOD via ERK1/2 and reduced cellular ROS levels (7Santillo M. Mondola P. Seru R. Annella T. Cassano S. Ciullo I. Tecce M.F.

Different anchors may dictate different membrane compartments, localizing Ha and Ki-Ras in proximity of specific substrates (9Yan Z. Chen M. Perucho M. Friedman E. J. Biol.

We note, also, an important difference between the oncogenic activated form and the wild-type version of ras genes. This is illustrated by the opposing effects of these forms on life span of S. cerevisiae: deletion of ras2 or expression of the active RASVal19 allele decreased life span; overexpression of yeast wild-type RAS2 extended life span (11Sun J.

In this work, we present a novel level of regulation of Ras proteins, dependent on ERK1/2 signaling. Specifically, we have found that PDGF and ROS induce Ha-Ras in primary fibroblasts. This has revealed a novel and hitherto unknown pathway, which links ROS to Ras protein levels through ERK1/2. We find a remarkable example of this circuitry in vivo in cells derived from patients affected by systemic sclerosis. This signaling pathway is initiated by stimulation of PDGF receptor and maintained by ROS-ERK1/2 signals. Systemic sclerosis cells produce excess of ROS (12Sambo P. Baroni S.S. Luchetti M. Paroncini P. Dusi S. Orlandini G. Gabrielli A. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 2653-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) and maintain active Ras-ERK1/2. These cells accumulate DNA damage, activate ROS-dependent genes and become prone to stress-induced apoptosis. Inhibition of ROS, Ras, or ERK1/2 down-regulates the loop and restores the normal phenotype in systemic sclerosis fibroblasts. These data point to Ras a key sensor of cellular ROS and suggest a molecular tool for the diagnosis and therapy of systemic sclerosis.

The cDNA for collagen α1(I) (Hf677 clone) and for collagen α2(I) (Hf32 clone) were kindly donated by Dr. Ch. M. Lapiere (Laboratorie de Biologie des Tissues Conjonctifs, University of Liege, Belgium). Primary Fibroblasts—Human skin fibroblasts were obtained from punch biopsies taken from the forearms of normal volunteers and from the involved skin of patients who fulfilled the preliminary criteria of the American Rheumatism Association for the diagnosis of systemic sclerosis as described (14Sambo P. Jannino L. Candela M. Salvi A. Donini M. Dusi S. Luchetti M.M. Gabrielli A. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1999; 112: 78-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Fibroblasts between the fourth and the sixth subpassage were used for all experiments. Flow Cytometric Analysis with Anti-Ha-Ras Antibody—Cells were grown to semiconfluency in 60-mm culture dishes. After trypsin detachment, 5 × 105 cells were suspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed overnight with 1% formaldehyde at room temperature. Next, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 40 min at 4 °C, washed four times with 2 ml of PBS containing 2% FCS, 0.01% NaN3, 0.1% Triton X-100 (buffer A), and incubated for 45 min at 4 °C with 1:50 dilution of monoclonal and polyclonal anti-Ha-Ras antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The cells were then washed twice with the same buffer and incubated for 45 min at 4 °C with Cy2-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) at 1:50 dilution. Control cells were incubated with Cy2-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibodies alone. After two washes in buffer A, cells were resuspended in PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry using FACScan (BD, Heidelberg, Germany) and WinMDI software. ROS Determination—Fluorometric determination of intracellular ROS generated by fibroblasts was estimated after loading the cells with DCFH-DA (10 μm) for 15 min at 37 °C before assessing DCF fluorescence level (15Cuda G. Paterno R. Ceravolo R. Candigliota M. Perrotti N. Perticone F. Faniello M.C. Schepis F. Ruocco A. Mele E. Cassano S. Bifulco M. Santillo M. Avvedimento E.V. Circulation. 2002; 105: 968-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Superoxide anion release was estimated using the superoxide dismutase-inhibitable cytochrome c reduction (12Sambo P. Baroni S.S. Luchetti M. Paroncini P. Dusi S. Orlandini G. Gabrielli A. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 2653-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). H2O2 release from fibroblasts into the overlying medium was assayed using a modification of the method of Valletta and Berton (16Valletta E.A. Berton G. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 4366-4373PubMed Google Scholar). Oxidative activity imaging in living, transfected cells was evaluated as described (12Sambo P. Baroni S.S. Luchetti M. Paroncini P. Dusi S.

Methods Enzymol. 1999; 307: 340-350PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblotting—Cell culture plates were lysed with 0.3 ml of cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1× PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and processed as described (14Sambo P.

Ras Immunoprecipitation—Ras proteins were immunoprecipitated from cultured fibroblasts with polyclonal anti-pan Ras antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) following recommended procedures from the manufacturer. Immunocomplexes were isolated, electrophoresed, immunoblotted with anti-Ha-Ras or -Ki-Ras antibodies, and revealed by chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescence—Fibroblasts, cultured on Lab-Tek chamber glass slides (Nalge-Nunc) and starved 48 h before stimulation or addition of inhibitors, were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with a monoclonal antibody against Ha-Ras or Ki-Ras and then with a tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-(TRITC; Molecular Probes, PoortGebouw, The Nederlands) conjugated secondary antibody. Slides were mounted with Vectorshield (H-100; Vector, Burlingame, CA) and examined by fluorescence microscope. Acquired images were analyzed using the Laser Sharp Processing Bio-Rad software (version 3.2). All images from different slides condition were acquired in a blinded fashion. Ras Activation Assay—Cells were washed in ice-cold PBS and lysed with 0.5 ml per plate of lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation (13,000 rpm at 4 °C) and diluted to 1 mg/ml with lysis buffer. GST-RBD expression in transformed Escherichia coli was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 1-2 h, and fusion protein was purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads. The beads were washed in a solution containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 120 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. For affinity precipitation, lysates were incubated with GST-RBD prebound to glutathione-Sepharose (30 ml of packed beads) for 60 min at 4 °C with rocking. Bound proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, resolved on 12% acrylamide gels and subjected to Western blotting. Blots were probed with anti-Ras, clone Ras10 (Upstate Biotechnology). Transfection—For transfection experiments, confluent fibroblasts were plated in 100-mm dishes in culture medium. After 24 h, the medium was discarded, replaced with fresh culture medium, and the cells transfected. Transfection experiments were carried out in duplicate using a liposomal method (Effectene, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). In selected experiments the recombinant plasmid pGbC1A2-P obtained by cloning the promoter of human type I collagen α2 chain gene (COL1A2) (20Tuveson D.A. Shaw A.T. Willis N.A. Silver D.P. Jackson E.L. Chang S. Mercer K.L. Grochow R. Hock H. Crowley D. Hingorani S.R. Zaks T. King C. Jacobetz M.A. Wang L. Bronson R.T. Orkin S.H. DePinho R.A. Jacks T. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 375-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar) was co-transfected with either pS3CAT carrying human catalase gene (a kind gift of Dr. Irani, The Johns Hopkins, Baltimore) or a control vector following the procedure described above. The luciferase activities of the samples were measured with a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Design) and the ratio of Renilla to firefly luciferase values was used to normalize the co-transfection experiments. Apoptosis Assay—Normal and scleroderma fibroblasts were grown to 80-90% confluence and treated for 2 h with different concentrations of H2O2. When needed, cells were preincubated 30 min with PD 98059 (40 μmol/liter). Six hours after the removal of the stimulus, apoptosis was detected by FACS analysis using annexin V-Cy3 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). RNA Isolation and Northern Analysis—Total cellular RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). Ten micrograms total RNA was then used for Northern blot analysis following a described procedure (12Sambo P. Baroni S.S. Luchetti M. Paroncini P. Dusi S. Orlandini G. Gabrielli A. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 2653-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). RT-PCR of Ha- and Ki-Ras mRNA—Total RNA and cDNA synthesis was performed as described (18Feliciello A. Gallo A. Mele E. Porcellini A. Troncone G. Garbi C. Gottesman M.E. Avvedimento E.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 303-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). 2 μl of cDNA products (derived from 2.5 μg of total RNA) were amplified with 1 unit of Ampli Taq Gold (PE Applied Biosystems) in the buffer provided by the manufacturer, which contains no MgCl2, and in the presence of the specific primers for Ha-, Ki-ras and actin genes (see below). The amount of dNTPs carried over from the reverse transcription reaction is fully sufficient for further amplification. Reactions were carried out in the GeneAmp PCR system 9600. A first cycle of 10 min at 95 °C, 45 s at 65 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C was followed by 45 s at 95 °C, 45 s at 65 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C for 30 cycles. The conditions were chosen so that none of the cDNAs analyzed reached a plateau at the end of the amplification protocol, i.e. they were in the exponential phase of amplification, and that the two sets of primers used in each reaction did not compete with each other. Each set of reactions always included a no-sample negative control. We usually performed a negative control containing RNA instead of cDNA to rule out genomic DNA contamination. The following primers were used: Ki-ras long, left primer: acatctctttgctgcccaat; right primer: gagcgagactctgacaccaa. Ki-ras short, left primer: tcgacacagcaggtcaagag; right primer: aggcatcatcaacaccctgt. Ha-ras, left primer: ccagctgatccagaaccatt; right primer: aggtctcgatgtaggggatg. Cytogenetic Analysis—Cytogenetic studies were performed on fibroblasts before and after a 24-h incubation with FTI-277 (20 μm). Fibroblasts were cultured on cover glasses placed in a 35-mm Petri dish. After adding 2 ml of Chang Medium® B the dishes were incubated for 48 h in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C and the cultures harvested after adding Colcemid solution (0,1 μg/ml) for 90 min. The cover glasses were fixed and Q-banded following standard procedures. The evaluation was performed using a fluorescence microscope Zeiss Axioplan 2. The images were captured with a couple-charged camera device connected to a personal computer running MacKtype 5.4 software (Powergene Olympus Italy). Chromosome identification and karyotype designation were made following the criteria of the International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature (ISCN). Chromatin Extraction and Immunoblot for Phosphorylated H2AX—Cell culture plates were lysed with 0.2 ml of buffer (120 mm NaCl, 40 mm Hepes, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.6% Triton X-100, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the protein content was measured with the Bio-Rad protein assay (12Sambo P. Baroni S.S. Luchetti M. Paroncini P. Dusi S. Orlandini G. Gabrielli A. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 2653-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The pellet was resuspended in 40 ml of buffer with 80-100 units of DNase, and incubated for 15 min on ice. Extracts were denatured and resolved in 12% SDS-PAGE. Immunoblot with specific antibodies was carried out as described above. Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as mean ± 1 S.D. Mean values were compared using Student's paired and unpaired t test. p values less than 0.05 were considered significant. All values are two-tailed. Induction of Ras Protein Levels by PDGF—In quiescent primary human fibroblasts Ha-Ras protein was almost undetectable. To determine precisely the levels of Ki- and Ha-Ras protein, we immunoprecipitated total cell proteins, solubilized in 0.1% SDS (radioimmune precipitation assay buffer), with pan Ras antibody. The immunoprecipitates were separated by gel electrophoresis and blotted with specific Ras isoform antibodies. Stimulation of the cells with PDGF for 15 min was sufficient to induce Ha-Ras protein, which decreased to the initial level, 120 min after stimulation, notwithstanding the presence of the growth factor. Ki-Ras protein levels were also stimulated by PDGF but less efficiently and with a different kinetics. Ki-Ras was poorly induced and decayed slowly (3 h of PDGF stimulation) (Fig. 1A). Ha-Ras induction was also visible by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1B) or FACS analysis with anti-Ha-Ras monoclonal or polyclonal specific antibodies (Fig. 1C). Treatment of the cells with the translational inhibitor cycloheximide did not prevent Ha-Ras induction by PDGF (Fig. 1D). Moreover, PDGF treatment did not change mRNA levels of Ki- and Ha-Ras (Fig. 1E). To rule out that Ha-Ras induced by PDGF was an artifact, caused by association of the protein with the lipid-rich membrane fractions and consequently was not efficiently extracted by immunoprecipitation procedures, we treated the cells with 50 mm cyclodextrin to deplete cholesterol before immunoprecipitation. Treatment with cyclodextrin did not abolish PDGF induction of Ha-Ras (Fig. S1, supplemental material). Taken together, these data indicate that the levels of Ha- and Ki-Ras proteins are post-translationally regulated by PDGF in primary fibroblasts. PDGF Stimulation of ROS and ERK1/2—PDGF activates ROS production by stimulating NADPH oxidase (3Chen K.C. Zhou Y. Xing K. Krysan K. Lou M.F. Exp. Eye Res. 2004; 78: 1057-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 19Kreuzer J. Viedt C. Brandes R.P. Seeger F. Rosenkranz A.S. Sauer H. Babich A. Nurnberg B. Kather H. Krieger-Brauer H.I. Faseb. J. 2003; 17: 38-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The kinetics of ROS production following PDGF stimulation replicated that of Ha-Ras induction (Figs. 1 and 2A). To determine if ROS were involved in Ha-Ras induction by PDGF, we treated the cells with a nonspecific ROS scavenger (NAC) or NADPH oxidase inhibitor (DPI) and measured Ha-Ras levels in the presence or absence of PDGF. Fig. 2B shows that NAC and DPI significantly inhibited PDGF induced Ha-Ras levels. This is also shown by immunofluorescence with anti-Ha-Ras antibodies (Fig. 2C). The kinetics of Ha-Ras induction by PDGF in normal cells replicated also ERK1/2 activation profile (data not shown), suggesting a relation between MEK-ERK1/2 and induction of Ha-Ras. To get an insight into this process, we measured Ha-Ras in cells pretreated with a chemical inhibitor of ERK1/2 signaling (PD 98059), which inhibits MEK (MAPKK), a kinase located upstream of ERK1/2 (MAPK). Treatment of the cells with PD98059 inhibited Ha-Ras induction by PDGF (Fig. 2D). In the same extracts, subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Ras antibodies, we measured PDGF receptor. Fig. 2D shows that PDGF treatment down-regulated the receptor, independently on ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 2D). To determine if ERK1/2 activation by PDGF was also sensitive to ROS depletion, we treated the cells with PDGF in the presence of a general ROS scavenger (NAC) or the NADPH oxidase inhibitor (DPI). Fig. 2E shows that ERK1/2 activated by PDGF was sensitive to NAC and DPI, indicating that ROS depletion interfered with ERK1/2 activation by PDGF. However, we noticed that a fraction of ERK1/2 induced by PDGF was resistant to NAC or DPI (Fig. 2E). ROS Induce Ha-Ras Level—The data presented above indicate that PDGF via ROS and ERK1/2 induce Ha-Ras protein levels in primary fibroblasts. To investigate the mechanism and the link between PDGF and ROS, we stimulated the cells with H2O2 in the presence of chemical and biological inhibitors of ERK1/2 signaling. To this end, we employed 1) PD 98059 and U0126 (2 h and 15 min of incubation, respectively), which inhibit MEK (MAPKK); and 2) a dominant-negative MEK variant that inhibits cellular MEK (see “Materials and Methods”). The results, shown in Fig. 3, A-C, demonstrate that induction of Ha-Ras by H2O2 was abolished by MEK inhibition. To confirm that H2O2 was down-stream PDGF, we treated the cells with genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in the presence of PDGF or H2O2. The data shown in Fig. 3D indicate that H2O2 was a powerful inducer of Ha-Ras, also in the presence of genistein. As expected, the drug inhibited the induction of Ha-Ras by PDGF. However, longer incubation periods (90 min) in the presence of genistein inhibited Ha-Ras and ERK1/2 induced by H2O2, indicating that long term effects of H2O2 required active PDGF receptor (data not shown). Taken together the data, illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3, indicate that PDGF via ERK1/2 and via ROS induced Ha-Ras protein. ROS are downstream the PDGF receptor, because they induced Ha-Ras independently on the activation of the receptor. Down-regulation of ERK1/2 (Figs. 2, D and E and 3) reduced Ha-Ras levels. Maintaining ERK1/2 high, by expressing constitutively active Ha-Ras or a dominant-positive MEK protein, ROS production was high and Ha-Ras did not decay (Fig. S2B, supplemental material). Only Ha-Ras was stabilized, since Ki-Ras levels were marginally affected by ERK1/2 inhibition in primary fibroblasts. More importantly, Ha-Ras stabilization was peculiar to primary cells, because immortalized cells such as 3T3 fibroblasts, CHO, PC12, and COS7 contained stable and high levels of Ha-Ras, which were insensitive to ERK1/2 inhibition. 4S. Cassano, unpublished observation. Also, expression of constitutive MEK-ERK2 or prolonged treatment of fibroblasts with H2O2 did not change Ha-Ras mRNA levels (Fig. S3, supplementary material). The data shown above do not clearly indicate the mechanism responsible for Ha-Ras stabilization induced by PDGF-ROS-ERK1/2. To this end, we treated the cells with MG132, a widely used proteasome inhibitor and monensin, a toxin known to inhibit receptor recycling through the inhibition of endosome acidification. Fig. 3E shows that MG132 induced Ha-Ras, and its effect was not additive when administered with PDGF or H2O2. Conversely, monensin had no effect alone or with PDGF or H2O2 on Ha-Ras levels. Under the same conditions, Ki-Ras or PDGFR protein levels were not influenced by MG132 treatment (Fig. 3F). Amplification of ROS-Ras Signaling in Vivo in Scleroderma Fibroblasts—To determine if the signaling pathway connecting ROS to Ras was relevant in vivo, we took advantage of fibroblasts derived from patients affected by systemic sclerosis. These cells produce high levels of ROS (12Sambo P. Baroni S.S. Luchetti M. Paroncini P. Dusi S. Orlandini G. Gabrielli A. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 2653-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) and are subjected to constitutive stimulation in vivo of PDGF signaling for the presence in the serum of patients of stimulating anti-PDGF receptor antibodies. 5S. Svegliati, M. R. Santillo, F. Bevilacqua, M. Luchetti, T. Spadoni, M. Mancini, A. Funaro, A. Kazlavskas, V. E. Avvedimento, and A. Gabrielli, submitted manuscript. Fig. 4A shows that three fibroblast lines derived from these patients contain high ROS, superoxide, and H2O2 levels. ROS accumulation was severely inhibited by farnesyl transferase and MEK inhibitors (Fig. 4A). Moreover, these cells contained higher levels of Ha-Ras protein, compared with normal controls (Fig. 4B). Ras activity was also increased relative to normal control cells (Fig. 4C). We have recently completed the analysis of 46 patients affected by systemic sclerosis, and in all cases the ratio Ha/Ki protein levels was higher than 2. 5S. Svegliati, M. R. Santillo, F. Bevilacqua, M. Luchetti, T. Spadoni, M. Mancini, A. Funaro, A. Kazlavskas, V. E. Avvedimento, and A. Gabrielli, submitted manuscript. The analysis of downstream Ras effectors (AKT and ERK1/2) or other stress kinases (JNK) indicated that only ERK1/2 were selectively activated (Fig. 4D). ROS, Ras, and ERK1/2 activation were linked, because MEK inhibitors, ROS scavengers, or farnesyl transferase inhibitors were able to reduce Ras P-ERK1/2 and ROS levels (Figs. 3, A and B and 4A). ROS, Ha-Ras and active ERK1/2 slowly decayed in cells cultured in low serum and in 1-2 days returned to the baseline (data not shown). Biological Consequences of Ha-Ras Stabilization in Vivo Are High ROS, High ERK, DNA Damage, Collagen Synthesis, and Senescence—We next asked if ROS-Ras amplification was affecting the phenotype of these cell lines. To this end, we determined: 1) activation of DNA damage checkpoints and chromosomal alterations; 2) stress-induced apoptosis; 3) activation of transcription of collagen genes by ROS. Fig. 5 shows that scleroderma cells contained: 1) activated ATM, assayed by phosphorylation of histone H2AX; 2) accumulation of p21 WAF (Fig. 5A), and 3) damaged chromosomes (Fig. 5B). The chromosomal aberrations were present in vivo before the expansion in culture and were continuously generated in culture. These alterations were amplified by ROS and resulted in negative selection of these cells (data not shown). This explains why the number of altered metaphases was significantly reduced by incubating the cells with farnesyl transferase inhibitors or ROS scavengers during the first and second day of culture (Fig. 5B). These cells were extremely sensitive to oxidative stress-induced apoptosis, which was inhibited by pretreatment with MEK inhibitor, PD98059 (Fig. 5C). Finally, transcription of collagen genes, which was exquisitely sensitive to ROS, was greatly stimulated (Fig. 5, D and E). All these features were inhibited by treatment of the cells with either MEK or farnesyl transferase inhibitors or ROS scavengers (Fig. 5, B-E). To date we have replicated these data in ∼15 independent fibroblast lines derived from systemic sclerosis patients (data not shown). As a complementary approach, we transfected normal fibroblasts with Ha- or Ki-Ras at approximately the same ratio present in scleroderma cells (3:1). We found that ROS production was significantly stimulated by Ha-Ras expression. We replicated in normal fibroblasts all the features indicated in Fig. 5 (collagen induction, DNA damage, H2O2-induced apoptosis) by expressing Ha-Ras in a ratio 5:1 relative to Ki-Ras (Fig. S2, supplementary material and Ref. 15Cuda G. Paterno R. Ceravolo R. Candigliota M. Perrotti N. Perticone F. Faniello M.C. Schepis F. Ruocco A. Mele E. Cassano S. Bifulco M. Santillo M. Avvedimento E.V. Circulation. 2002; 105: 968-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). These data establish a link between ROS-Ras amplification and the complex phenotype of scleroderma fibroblasts in vivo. Moreover, they provide the tools for a possible diagnosis and a targeted therapy of this so far not curable illness. The data reported here indicate a novel level of regulation of Ras proteins, so far unknown. In established and immortal cell lines, Ras is solely regulated by GTP-GDP binding activity. Because widespread expression of Ha- or Ki-Ras is not tolerated during development or in adult organisms, in primary cells the levels of the proteins are maintained low (20Tuveson D.A. Shaw A.T.

In peripheral lymphocytes, primary mouse neurons and astrocytes ROS induce Ha- or Ki-Ras protein levels. 6E. Janda and A. Porcellini, personal communication. In primary fibroblasts, the accumulation of Ras protein is triggered by PDGF and ERK1/2 (Figs. 1 and 2). ROS induced by PDGF maintain ERK1/2 active (Fig. 2). ROS induction of Ha-Ras is independent on PDGF stimulation and can be maintained by ROS (Fig. 3). However, in the absence of PDGF stimulation, H2O2 is not able to maintain high Ha-Ras levels for longer periods (2 h). As to the mechanism underlying Ha-Ras induction by PDGF and ROS, the data shown in Fig. 3F indicate that the Ha-Ras protein is degraded by the 26 S proteasome and that ERK1/2 protect Ha-Ras from degradation (Fig. 3, A-C). Because MG132 and PDGF effects were not additive, we suggest that PDGF via ERK1/2 inhibits proteasome degradation of Ha-Ras. At present, we do not know if proteasome directly degrades Ras protein. There is a similar example of proteasomal degradation inhibited by ERK1/2 signaling: c-Myc is degraded by the proteasome (21Bonvini P. Nguyen P. Trepel J Neckers L.M. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and is stabilized by stress via MEKK1 (22Alarcon-Vargas1 D. Tansey W.P. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 2002; 21 (2002): 4384-4391Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). ROS and ERK1/2 result in increased Ha-Ras protein levels. Under these conditions, Ha-Ras is more likely to be activated by low PDGF levels. A schematic diagram illustrating the link between ROS and Ha-Ras protein levels is shown in Fig. 6. We propose that ROS increase Ras protein levels and amplify PDGF signaling. Down-regulation of Ras levels protects primary cells from excessive stimulation by growth factors, which may result in DNA damage, oxidative stress, and ultimately in apoptosis. Amplification of ROS-Ras Signaling in Vivo—The pathway we have described is relevant in vivo, because we find that cells isolated from lesions of patients affected by systemic sclerosis, contain the key elements indicated in Fig. 6. Systemic sclerosis is an autoimmune disease, characterized by extensive fibrosis of the skin and internal organs, because of exaggerated production of collagen by fibroblasts (23Kahari V.M. Vuorio T. Nanto-Salonen K. Vuorio E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 781: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Fibroblasts, derived from systemic sclerosis patients, contain high Ha-Ras and ROS levels and constitutive activation of ERK1/2. These features are the hallmarks of the signaling pathway we have described above in normal fibroblasts stimulated with H2O2. In Fig. S2 (supplementary materials) we show that we can convert normal in scleroderma fibroblasts by overexpressing Ha-Ras. Conversely, overexpression of Ki-Ras or catalase inhibited the scleroderma phenotype in fibroblasts, isolated from scleroderma lesions. We have recently found that the triggers of the scleroderma phenotype are stimulating antibodies against PDGF receptor. Systemic sclerosis patients synthesize stimulating antibodies to the PDGF receptor. These antibodies stimulate fibroblasts and monocytes to produce high ROS (14Sambo P. Jannino L. Candela M. Salvi A. Donini M. Dusi S. Luchetti M.M. Gabrielli A. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1999; 112: 78-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), which set off ERK1/2 and induce Ha-Ras. 5S. Svegliati, M. R. Santillo, F. Bevilacqua, M. Luchetti, T. Spadoni, M. Mancini, A. Funaro, A. Kazlavskas, V. E. Avvedimento, and A. Gabrielli, submitted manuscript. Inhibition of any of the components of this loop (ERK1/2, Ras, ROS) down-regulated the system and abolished the biological effects of Ras-ROS activation, such as accelerated senescence of fibroblasts, which characterizes the phenotype of systemic sclerosis cells (23Kahari V.M. Vuorio T. Nanto-Salonen K. Vuorio E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 781: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 24Ohtsuka T. Dermatology. 1998; 196: 204-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). This phenotype is characterized by: 1) high susceptibility to apoptosis; 2) severe DNA damage, 3) vigorous transcription of collagen genes. In this framework, fibrosis is the consequence of loss of cells (apoptosis) and deposition of collagen (23Kahari V.M. Vuorio T. Nanto-Salonen K. Vuorio E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 781: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 24Ohtsuka T. Dermatology. 1998; 196: 204-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The loop triggered initially by PDGF receptor activation, is reinforced by high ROS produced by activation of NADPH oxidase by Ha-Ras-ERK1/2 (24Ohtsuka T. Dermatology. 1998; 196: 204-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Thus, inhibition of either ROS, or ERK1/2 or Ras converts scleroderma to normal fibroblasts. However, we find that PDGF signaling is required for long term ROS production, because inhibition of PDGF receptor for 4-12 h reduced Ras-ROS-ERK1/2-collagen levels (Fig. 6 and data not shown). In the presence of physiological stimuli, we believe that the regulation of Ras protein levels protects primary cells from excessive or inappropriate signals. Coupling ROS to Ras highlights the primary role of Ras proteins as sensors and regulators of redox signals. The different turn-over in primary cells and the different effects on ROS levels by Ha- and Ki-Ras (7Santillo M. Mondola P. Seru R. Annella T. Cassano S. Ciullo I. Tecce M.F. Iacomino G. Damiano S.

Constitutive or mutationally activation of Ras-ERK1/2 signaling results in loss of this type of metabolic regulation. This may explain the opposite life-span phenotypes of S. cerevisiae expressing ras2Val19 or ras2 wild-type gene (11Sun J. Kale S.P. Childress A.M. Pinswasdi C. Jazwinski S.M. J. Biol.

A key component in this pathway is a Drosophila IκB kinase (DmIKK) complex, which stimulates the cleavage and activation of the NF-κB transcription factor Relish.

In human cells, the activation of TAK1 and IKK requires the human ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes Ubc13 and UEV1a.

The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has evolved multiple mechanisms to combat infectious microorganisms, including both cellular and humoral innate immune responses, and several proteolytic cascades (1Hoffmann J.A.

Activation of the humoral insect immune response leads to the rapid production of a battery of potent antimicrobial peptides such as Cecropin, Diptericin, Defensin, Drosocin, Mechnikowin, and Drosomycin (5Hoffmann J.A. Reichhart J.-M. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 309-316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Considerable progress has been made in understanding the signal transduction pathways that govern the Drosophila humoral immune response. In particular, two distinct pathways, Toll and IMD, have been characterized (6Lemaitre B. Kromer-Metzger E. Michaut L. Nicolas E. Meister M. Georgel P. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Infection by fungi or Gram-positive bacteria triggers the processing of Spätzle (SPZ) 2The abbreviations used are: SPZ, Spätzle; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; DmIKK, Drosophila IκB kinase complex; IMD, immune deficiency; TRAF, TNF receptor-associated factor. by an extracellular proteolytic cascade. The processed SPZ protein then activates the Toll receptor, which transduces a signal through adaptor proteins dMyD88 and Tube, a serine/threonine kinase Pelle and a yet-to-be-identified Cactus kinase, leading to Cactus phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and subsequent degradation by the 26 S proteasome. This frees Dif and Dorsal to translocate to the nucleus and activate Drosomycin, which encodes a potent antifungal peptide. A distinct signaling pathway, the IMD pathway, is activated in response to infection by Gram-negative bacteria and culminates in the production of antibacterial peptides. Both genetic- and cell-based studies have identified several components of this pathway. Inactivation of most of the genes encoding these components results in the complete and specific inactivation of the IMD pathway. The IMD pathway is induced by the recognition of Gram-negative peptidoglycan (PGN) via the receptor PGRP-LC/ird7 (8Choe K.M. Werner T. Stöven S. Hultmark D. Anderson K.V.

U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1122-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), which is homologous to mammalian RIP1, a critical adaptor protein in the TNFR complex (14Georgel P. Naitza S. Kappler C.

In turn, IMD is required for the activation of the Drosophila MAP kinase kinase kinase dTAK1, although the mechanisms of dTAK1 activation are unknown. In humans, the TRAF proteins are required for the activation of TAK1 in the TNFR and TLR signaling pathways. The Drosophila TRAF6 homolog, dTRAF2, may serve a similar function in the IMD pathway, because dTRAF2 has recently been shown to be required for maximal levels of antimicrobial gene expression in response to Escherichia coli infection in flies (15Cha G.H.

In unstimulated cells Relish is present in the cytoplasm as a full-length precursor. Upon activation of the IMD pathway, Relish is cleaved, and the N terminus, NF-κB-like cleavage product translocates to the nucleus where it drives transcription of antimicrobial peptide genes (19Stöven S. Ando I. Kadalayil L. Engström Y. Hultmark D. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). IMD pathway-mediated Relish activation requires the Drosophila FADD homolog and its partner caspase DREDD, as well as dTAK1 and the DmIKK complex (20Stöven S. Silverman N. Junell A. Hedengren-Olcott M. Erturk D. Engström Y. Maniatis T. Hultmark D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5991-5996Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). It is believed that Relish is phosphorylated by DmIKK, and this phosphorylation is required for its DREDD-mediated cleavage (19Stöven S. Ando I. Kadalayil L. Engström Y. Hultmark D. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 20Stöven S. Silverman N. Junell A. Hedengren-Olcott M. Erturk D. Engström Y. Maniatis T. Hultmark D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Jung A.C. Zhou R. Silverman N. Hoffmann J.A. Ferrandon D. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 342-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Consistent with this model, the Drosophila IKK can directly phosphorylate Relish, and Relish cleavage is likely mediated by a caspase. However, DREDD has not been shown to directly cleave Relish. Recent biochemical studies have revealed a novel mechanism of action for the TRAF6-mediated activation of IKK and NF-κB in mammals. TRAFs are required for NF-κB activation following IL-1R, TLR, or TNFR stimulation. TRAF proteins contain an N-terminal RING domain, a signature domain for ubiquitin E3 ligases. In vitro, TRAF6-mediated activation of the IκB kinase requires the synthesis of polyubiquitin chains linked through Lys-63 of ubiquitin. This conjugation requires the E2 proteins Ubc13 and UEV1a (24Deng L. Wang C. Spencer E. Yang L. Braun A. You J. Slaughter C. Pickart C. Chen Z.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this ubiquitination does not lead to proteasome-mediated degradation of TRAF6. Rather, it activates TRAF6, which in turn activates TAK1 (25Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G.R. Inoue J. Chen Z.J. Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). This activation of TAK1 requires an associated protein, TAB2, which specifically binds to Lys-63 polyubiquitin chains through a conserved zinc finger domain (26Kanayama A. Seth R.B. Sun L. Ea C.K. Hong M. Shaito A. Chiu Y.H. Deng L. Chen Z.J. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 535-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). At present, the mechanism by which the DmIKK complex is activated by IMD and dTAK1 is not understood. In this study we address the question of whether ubiquitination is required for this process. We also investigate the role of the adaptor protein dFADD and the apical caspase DREDD in the activation of IMD signaling. Using RNAi in immune responsive Drosophila cells in culture, we demonstrate that the Drosophila homologs of Ubc13 and UEV1a, dFADD, and DREDD are all required for IKK activation. DNA Constructs and Stable Cell Lines—Bendless (C87A) mutant was generated using the QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). DNA fragments encoding FLAG-tagged wild-type and C87A Bendless, FLAG-tagged IMD, and dTAK1Δ(amino acids 1-284) were generated by PCR and cloned into pRmHa-3 by standard cloning techniques and verified by sequencing. The pRmHa-3-SPZ-C106 construct was generated by inserting pJM856-Spa-C106 fragment into pRmHa-3 using BamHI and SalI restriction sites. These pRmHa-3 series of DNA constructs, in which the expression of the transgene is controlled by the metallothionein promoter, were co-transfected with pHS-neo at the ratio of 50:1 into S2 cells. Stable transfectants were selected with G418 (800 μg/ml). S2 cells were maintained in Schneider's Drosophila medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 1% GlutaMax-1 (Invitrogen), and 0.2% Pen-Strep (Invitrogen). SPZ-containing Conditioned Medium Preparation—pRmHa-3-SPZ-C106 cell line was plated at the density of 106 cells/ml in 10-ml tissue culture plates. Cells were treated 24 h later with 20-hydroxy-ecdysone (Sigma) at 10-6 m and copper at 0.5 mm. After 48 h, cells were spun down, and the SPZ-containing conditioned medium was harvested. dsRNA Synthesis, Cell Transfection, Cell Induction, RNA Isolation, and Northern Blotting— dsRNA synthesis was performed as described before (21Silverman N. Zhou R. Stöven S. Pandey N. Hultmark D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2461-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). S2 cells were plated at the density of 106 cells/ml in 6-well tissue culture plates (3 ml of cells per well). Cells were transfected 24 h later with 5 μg of each dsRNA along with 100 ng of a LacZ reporter plasmid. Cells were split 24 h after transfection to 106 cells/ml in 6-well tissue culture plates (3 ml of cells per well). After another 24 h, cells were treated with 20-hydroxy-ecdysone at 10-6 m for 24 h. Cells were then either stimulated with peptidoglycan (Sigma, crude E. coli 055:B5 LPS, 10 μg/ml) for 6 h or stimulated with equal volume of SPZ-containing conditioned medium for 48 h. In experiments involving FLAG-IMD stable cells, cells were first plated at the density of 106 cells/ml in 6-well tissue culture plates (3 ml of cells per well). Cells were transfected 24 h later with 5 μg of each dsRNA along with 100 ng of a LacZ reporter plasmid. Cells were split 24 h after transfection to 106 cells/ml in 6-well tissue culture plates (3 ml of cells per well). After another 24 h, cells were treated with 20-hydroxy-ecdysone at 10-6 m for 24 h. Then cells were stimulated for 8 h with either peptidoglycan or copper sulfate (0.5 mm). Cells were then harvested, and RNA isolation and Northern blotting were performed as described previously (21Silverman N. Zhou R. Stöven S. Pandey N. Hultmark D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2461-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). dTAK1Δ stable cells were treated the same way as IMD cells were except that the duration of copper sulfate treatment was 12 h. Kinase Assay—His-tagged full-length Relish protein was expressed in Sf9 cells using a baculovirus expression system and purified on Ni-NTA. S2 cells were first transfected with various dsRNAs as described above. Cells were split 24 h after transfection to 106 cells/ml in 6-well tissue culture plates (3 ml of cells per well). After an additional 24 h, cells were stimulated with peptidoglycan for 15 min and harvested. Cell extract preparation, immunoprecipitation, and kinase assays were performed as described previously except purified Relish protein was used as substrate in the kinase reactions (21Silverman N. Zhou R. Stöven S. Pandey N. Hultmark D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2461-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). We have established a cell culture system to study the IMD and Toll signaling pathways in S2 cells. The IMD pathway is activated by treating the cells with Gram-negative peptidoglycan (which is present in crude preparations of lipopolysaccharides) (12Kaneko T. Goldman W.E. Mellroth P. Steiner H. Fukase K. Kusumoto S. Harley W. Fox A. Golenbock D. Silverman N. Immunity. 2004; 20: 637-649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), whereas activation of the Toll pathway is achieved by treating the cells with the Spätzle ligand (27Weber A.N. Tauszig-Delamasure S. Hoffmann J.A. Lelievre E. Gascan H. Ray K.P. Morse M.A. Imler J.L. Gay N.J. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 794-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Active Spätzle is produced from a cell line stably transfected with a plasmid containing the copper-inducible metallothionein promoter driving the expression of active Spätzle C-106. When these cells are treated with copper, active SPZ is secreted into the medium, and this conditioned media can be used to activate naïve cells. Using the RNAi-mediated gene inactivation method (28Hammond S.M. Bernstein E. Beach D. Hannon G.J. Nature. 2000; 404: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (2422) Google Scholar), we found that SPZ-induced Drosomycin gene activation in S2 cells requires the Drosophila Rel proteins Dif and Dorsal, as well as Toll, dMyD88, Tube, Pelle, and Slimb, as expected (data not shown). In sharp contrast, these dsRNAs do not block the expression of antimicrobial peptide genes induced by peptidoglycan. Instead, RNAi studies demonstrate that peptidoglycan-induced gene expression requires all known components of the IMD pathway (data not shown). We have therefore used this RNAi approach to determine the roles of candidate signaling components in the IMD and Toll signaling pathways. The Ubiquitin-conjugating Enzymes Bendless and dUEV1a Are Required for the Induction of Antibacterial Peptides—Previous studies have shown that activation of the mammalian IKK complex requires a ubiquitination step (29Chen Z.J. Parent L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1996; 84: 853-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). In particular, TRAF6-mediated IKK activation was shown to require a dimeric ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme composed of the Ubc13 and UEV1a proteins (24Deng L. Wang C. Spencer E. Yang L. Braun A. You J. Slaughter C. Pickart C. Chen Z.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar). Bendless and dUEV1a are the Drosophila homologs of Ubc13 and UEV1a, respectively (this study and Refs. 30Muralidhar M.G. Thomas J.B. Neuron. 1993; 11: 253-266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 31Oh C.E. McMahon R. Benzer S. Tanouye M.A. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 3166-3179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have found that Bendless and dUEV1a, like their mammalian counterparts, associate with each other in vivo (data not shown). To investigate whether Bendless and dUEV1a are required for antibacterial gene expression in response to peptidoglycan, we used the RNAi-mediated gene inactivation method. S2 cells were transfected with various dsRNAs (as labeled on top of each panel of Fig. 1). After 48 h, cells were first treated with 20-hydroxy-ecdysone for 24 h to enhance their competence to induce antimicrobial genes in response to immune challenge (21Silverman N. Zhou R. Stöven S. Pandey N. Hultmark D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2461-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 32Dimarcq J.L. Imler J.L. Lanot R. Ezekowitz R.A. Hoffmann J.A. Janeway C.A. Lagueux M. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 27: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and then treated with peptidoglycan or SPZ to activate the IMD or Toll signaling pathways, respectively. Total RNA was isolated from these cells and subjected to Northern blotting analysis using cDNA fragments corresponding to Diptericin or Drosomycin as probes, to examine the activation of the IMD and Toll pathways, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1A, both Bendless and dUEV1a are required for maximal levels of antibacterial peptide gene expression in response to peptidoglycan treatment (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 8 and 10 to lane 4). In fact, when both Bendless and dUEV1a are both targeted by RNAi, Diptericin induction is reduced to near background levels (lane 12). (The partial effect of Bendless or dUEV1a RNAi alone is likely because of the fact that RNAi often does not generate a complete null phenotype.) By contrast, the induction of Drosomycin by Toll activation is unaffected by the RNAi-mediated knock-down of Bendless and dUEV1a (Fig. 1B, lanes 8, 10, and 12. Note that the same cells were stimulated with either peptidoglycan or SPZ in Fig. 1, A and B.) As a control, S2 cells treated with DmIKKγ or Toll dsRNA showed significantly reduced peptidoglycan-induced Diptericin or SPZ-induced Drosomycin gene expression, respectively. (Fig. 1, A and B, compare lanes 6 and 14 with lanes 2 and 4). As a control, mRNA and/or protein levels of targeted genes were examined by RT-PCR and/or Western blotting to confirm the effectiveness of RNAi (data not shown and supplementary Fig. S1). To provide further evidence that Bendless is involved in the IMD pathway, we used a dominant negative mutant Bendless to determine whether peptidoglycan-induced antibacterial gene activation can be blocked. Stable S2 cell lines were generated that express either wild-type or C87A Bendless under the control of the metallothionein promoter. The cysteine to alanine mutation at position 87 creates a dominant-negative mutant because this residue, located in the catalytic pocket in ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, is crucial for the catalytic activity of E2s. These cells were then treated with various combinations of peptidoglycan and copper (as indicated on top of Fig. 1C), and Northern blotting was employed to examine the expression of antibacterial genes including Attacin, Cecropin and Diptericin. Overexpression of wild-type Bendless has no effect on peptidoglycan-induced antibacterial gene activation, as similar levels of antibacterial peptide gene expression were detected in cells treated with or without copper (compare lanes 2 and 4). In contrast, overexpression of Bendless C87A leads to a significant reduction in peptidoglycan-activated expression of antibacterial peptide genes (compare lanes 6 and 8). Bendless flies have been identified which carry a proline to serine substitution at position 97 within the strictly conserved active site region of E2s (30Muralidhar M.G. Thomas J.B. Neuron. 1993; 11: 253-266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In order to determine whether bendless flies are defective in response to Gram-negative bacterial infection, we subjected both wild-type and bendless flies to E. coli infection and examined Diptericin gene activation by Northern blotting. As shown in Fig. 2, bendless flies display significantly weaker Diptericin gene activation compared with wild-type flies (compare lanes 4 and 5 with lanes 9 and 10). These results indicate that the Bendless-dUEV1a E2 complex is required for signaling by the IMD pathway. Bendless and dUEV1a Are Required for Drosophila IKK Activation—We also carried out experiments to determine whether Bendless and dUEV1a are required for peptidoglycan-induced activation of the DmIKK complex. Previous studies have shown that peptidoglycan treatment induces the kinase activity of the endogenous DmIKK complex in S2 cells (21Silverman N. Zhou R. Stöven S. Pandey N. Hultmark D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2461-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with dsRNAs corresponding to various mRNAs. After 48 h, these cells were treated with peptidoglycan for 15 min, and the endogenous DmIKK complex was immunoprecipitated and subjected to in vitro kinase assays using recombinant Relish protein as substrate. As shown in Fig. 3, Bendless or dUEV1a dsRNA treatment leads to a significant decrease in peptidoglycan-induced DmIKK kinase activity (lanes 8, 10, and 12), suggesting that Bendless and dUEV1a are required for peptidoglycan-induced DmIKK activation. As a control, DmIKKγ dsRNA treatment completely abolished peptidoglycan-induced DmIKK activation (lane 6). We conclude that the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes Bendless and dUEV1a are specifically involved in the Drosophila IMD pathway, and they play a role upstream of the DmIKK complex. Bendless and dUEV1a Function Downstream of IMD but Upstream of dTAK1—Overexpression of IMD in Drosophila results in the activation of antibacterial genes in the absence of bacterial infection (14Georgel P. Naitza S. Kappler C. Ferrandon D. Zachary D. Swimmer C. Kopczynski C. Duyk G. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). We show here that IMD overexpression, under control of the copper-inducible metallothionein promoter, can also strongly activate expression of the Diptericin gene in S2 cells. This stable cell line therefore provides a useful tool to perform an epistatic analysis to determine the position of Bendless/dUEV1a complex relative to IMD in the Drosophila antibacterial signaling pathway. The IMD stable cells were first transfected with dsRNAs derived from various genes and then stimulated with copper or peptidoglycan, and IMD- and peptidoglycan-induced Diptericin gene activation was examined. As shown in Fig. 4, overexpression of IMD, via the addition of copper, leads to strong activation of the Diptericin gene. In fact, copper-induced IMD expression is as potent as peptidoglycan in driving diptericin expression (compare lanes 7 and 13). Cells transfected with LacZ dsRNA show a similar Diptericin expression profile compared with cells that were mock-treated (compare lanes 7 and 8 with lanes 13 and 14). Consistent with the observation that the DmIKK complex functions downstream of IMD, cells transfected with DmIKKγ dsRNA are severely defective in both IMD- and peptidoglycan-induced Diptericin expression (lanes 9 and 15). Furthermore, cells treated with dsRNAs derived from Bendless and dUEV1a genes display a significant reduction in both peptidoglycan- and IMD-mediated Diptericin gene activation (compare lanes 10-12 and lanes 16-18 with lanes 7 and 8 and lanes 13 and 14, respectively). These results indicate that the ubiquitin conjugating enzymes Bendless and dUEV1a function downstream of IMD in this signaling pathway. It has been shown that overexpression of dTAK1 in Drosophila results in infection-independent Diptericin gene activation (16Vidal S. Khush R.S. Leulier F. Tzou P. Nakamura M. Lemaitre B. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1900-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). We also observed that overexpression in S2 cells of truncated dTAK1 (dTAK1Δ), containing just the N-terminal kinase domain, led to both DmIKK activation and Diptericin gene expression. We therefore employed this cell line to determine the order of signaling components relative to dTAK1. As shown in Fig. 4B, in cells treated with Bendless dsRNA, peptidoglycan-induced Diptericin gene activation was significantly reduced (compare lane 8 with lanes 5 and 6). In contrast, dTAK1Δ-induced Diptericin activation was not significantly affected in these cells (compare lane 12 with lanes 9 and 10), suggesting that the Bendless is not required for dTAK1Δ-mediated antibacterial peptide gene activation. These results suggest that the Bendless/dUEV1a complex functions upstream, or in parallel, to dTAK1. dFADD and DREDD Function Upstream of the Drosophila IKK Complex— dFADD is the Drosophila homolog of mammalian FADD, an adaptor protein in the TNFR signaling complex. Recent studies have implicated dFADD in the Drosophila IMD pathway (33Leulier F. Vidal S. Saigo K. Ueda R. Lemaitre B. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 996-1000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 34Naitza S. Rosse C. Kappler C. Georgel P. Belvin M. Gubb D. Camonis J. Hoffmann J.A. Reichhart J.M. Immunity. 2002; 17: 575-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The dFADD protein has been shown to interact with DREDD, an apical caspase also required in the IMD signaling pathway (35Leulier F. Rodriguez A. Khush R.S. Abrams J.M. Lemaitre B. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 36Hu S. Yang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30761-30764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To further examine the role of dFADD and DREDD in the Drosophila antibacterial pathway we studied the consequences of their inactivation in S2 cells. As expected, dFADD and DREDD dsRNA treatment caused a significant reduction in peptidoglycan-activated Diptericin expression (data not shown). Surprisingly, dFADD and DREDD were also required for activation of the IKK complex. dFADD dsRNA treatment abolished peptidoglycan-induced DmIKK activation (Fig. 5A, lane 8), and similar results were observed with DREDD dsRNA (lane 16). Taken together, these results show that dFADD and DREDD are essential components in the Drosophila antibacterial signaling pathway required for peptidoglycan-induced DmIKK activation. dFADD and DREDD Function Downstream of IMD but Upstream of dTAK1—We next carried out experiments to place dFADD and Dredd relative to IMD and dTAK1 in the IMD pathway, taking advantage of the observation that overexpression of either IMD or dTAK1Δ activates DmIKK in S2 cells. dTAK1Δ stable cells were first transfected with various dsRNAs, then treated with copper to induce transgene expression, and the endogenous DmIKK complex was then immunoprecipitated and its kinase activity examined. As shown in Fig. 5B, dTAK1Δ overexpression caused a significant activation of the DmIKK complex (lanes 1 and 2). Neither dFADD nor DREDD dsRNA affects dTAK1Δ-induced DmIKK activation (compare lanes 4 and 6 with lane 2). In sharp contrast, in a parallel experiment, either dFADD or DREDD dsRNA treatment was sufficient to inhibit IMD-induced DmIKK activation (Fig. 5C). We therefore conclude that similar to Bendless and dUEV1a, dFADD and DREDD function downstream of IMD but upstream of dTAK1. DREDD Is Required for Peptidoglycan-induced JNK Activation—Recently it has been shown that peptidoglycan-induced activation of Drosophila innate immunity bifurcates downstream of dTAK1, leading to the activation of both NF-κB and JNK signaling pathways (17Chen W.

Here, we provide a comprehensive documentation of MMPs in EAE and report that of all the MMPs that could be measured at peak disease in spinal cord tissue, MMP-12 was the most highly up-regulated. In contrast to previously published findings of MMPs in EAE, this increase in MMP-12 expression was associated with protection, as MMP-12 null mice had significantly worse maximum severity and EAE disease burden compared with wild-type (WT) controls. When spleen and lymph node cells were removed from EAE-afflicted WT and MMP-12 null mice at the same disease score before divergence of disease and restimulated in vitro, the MMP-12 null cells had significantly higher Th1 to Th2 cytokine ratio. Measurements of the transcriptional regulators of T cell polarization revealed that MMP-12 null cells had increased T-bet and reduced GATA-3 expression, a condition that favors a Th1 bias. These results emphasize that specific MMPs can have beneficial roles in inflammation, and they implicate MMPs in T effector polarization for the first time."
https://openalex.org/W2035348212,"Eph receptor tyrosine kinases and their ligands (ephrins) are key players during the development of the embryonic vasculature; however, their role and regulation in adult angiogenesis remain to be defined. Both receptors and ligands have been shown to be up-regulated in a variety of tumors. To address the hypothesis that hypoxia is an important regulator of Ephs/ephrins expression, we developed a mouse skin flap model of hypoxia. We demonstrate that our model truly represents segmental skin hypoxia by applying four independent methods: continuous measurement of partial cutaneous oxygen tension, monitoring of tissue lactate/pyruvate ratio, time course of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) induction, and localization of stabilized HIF-1alpha by immunofluorescence in the hypoxic skin flap. Our experiments indicate that hypoxia up-regulates not only HIF-1alpha and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression, but also Ephs and ephrins of both A and B subclasses in the skin. In addition, we show that in Hep3B and PC-3 cells, the hypoxia-induced up-regulation of Ephs and ephrins is abrogated by small interfering RNA-mediated down-regulation of HIF-1alpha. These novel findings shed light on the role of this versatile receptor/ligand family in adult angiogenesis. Furthermore, our model offers considerable potential for analyzing distinct mechanisms of neovascularization in gene-targeted mice."
https://openalex.org/W2043417946,"The ultrafast evolution of the electric field within bacteriorhodopsin was measured by monitoring the absorption changes of a tryptophan residue after excitation of retinal. The Trp absorption decreases within the first 200 femtoseconds and then recovers on time scales typical for retinal isomerization and vibrational relaxation. A model of excitonic coupling between retinal and tryptophans shows that the signal reflects a gradual rise of the retinal difference dipole moment, which precedes and probably drives isomerization. The results suggest an intimate connection between the progressive dipole moment change and the retinal skeletal changes reported over the same time scale."

Several biochemical actions of WNK1 have been discovered. WNK1 can stimulate the activity of the MAPK ERK5 by acting upstream of the MAPK kinase kinases MEKK2 and MEKK3 (9Xu B. Stippec S. Lenertz L. Lee B.H. Zhang W. Lee Y.K. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7826-7831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Stimulation of ERK5 by low nanomolar concentrations of epidermal growth factor requires WNK1. In contrast, WNK1 is not required for activation of ERK5 by the osmotic stresses sorbitol and NaCl, although these agents stimulate WNK1 protein kinase activity. Together with the finding that kinase-deficient mutants of WNK1 also have some ability to activate MEKK3 and ERK5, this raises a question about the importance of WNK1 kinase activity in regulating the ERK5 pathway. Two-hybrid screens with WNK1 have identified two other WNK1 targets. The first of these, synaptotagmin 2, is a WNK1 substrate (10Lee B.H. Min X. Heise C.J. Xu B. Chen S. Shu H. Luby-Phelps K. Goldsmith E.J. Cobb M.H. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 741-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Synaptotagmin 2 is involved in Ca2+-dependent interactions with membranes and other proteins that are required for membrane fusion events (11Geppert M. Goda Y. Hammer R.E. Li C. Rosahl T.W. Stevens C.F. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 717-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar). WNK1 phosphorylation of synaptotagmin 2 increases the amount of Ca2+ required for its binding to phospholipid vesicles. As a result, phosphorylation of synaptotagmins by WNK1 may enhance the retention or insertion of proteins, including ion transporters, in the plasma membrane. A second WNK1 target found in a two-hybrid screen is the serum- and glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase, SGK1 (12Xu B. Stippec S. Chu P.-Y. Li X.-J. Lazrak A. Ortega B. Lee B.H. English J.M.

Immunoblotting was performed on proteins in cell lysates or immunoprecipitates that had been resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence. In vitro kinase assays of immunoprecipitates were performed as described previously using either recombinant Nedd4-2 or crosstide as substrates (12Xu B. Stippec S. Chu P.-Y. Li X.-J. Lazrak A.

Injected oocytes were incubated in ND96 bath solution containing (in mm) 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, and 5 Hepes (pH 7.4). 48-72 h postinjection, currents were recorded from oocytes in ND96 bath solution using an OC-725C oocyte clamp amplifier, pCLAMP7 software, and Digidata 1200A digitizer. Voltage clamp protocols consist of voltage steps (400 ms) from -100 to 50 mV in 25-mV increments from 0 mV holding potential. To verify that inward currents were carried by sodium ions, ND96 was replaced by a bath solution containing (in mm) 98 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, and 5 Hepes (pH 7.4). Statistical comparison was made using the unpaired t test. WNK1 Activates All Three SGK Isoforms—We showed previously that WNK1 activates SGK1 but not the related, kinases p70 S6 kinase or Akt, in transfected cells (12Xu B. Stippec S. Chu P.-Y. Li X.-J. Lazrak A. Ortega B. Lee B.H. English J.M. Huang C.-L. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10315-10320Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Because the three isoforms of SGK are differentially expressed in epithelial tissues, we first wanted to know the selectivity of WNK1 in activating SGK family members. Thus, we tested the ability of WNK1 to activate SGK2 and SGK3 using the peptide crosstide as the SGK substrate. We found that these SGK proteins were also stimulated by co-expression with WNK1, although to a more limited extent than SGK1 (Figs. 1 and 2A). The fact that all three SGKs are stimulated indicates that WNK1, which is ubiquitously expressed, can impact events in cells that express any of the three isoforms.FIGURE 2Activation of SGK1 by WNK1 is sensitive to inhibitors of PI 3-kinase. A, cells were treated with 10 μm U0126 for 1 h or 50 nm wortmannin for 30 min prior to harvest. SGK1 activity was assayed with crosstide as substrate. B, cells were treated with 20 μm SB203580 overnight or with 50 nm wortmannin (WM) for 30 min prior to harvest. SGK1 activity was assayed with recombinant Nedd4-2 as substrate. C, SGK1 activation by PDK1 is insensitive to wortmannin (WM). D, cells were treated with 20 μm LY294002 for 1 h prior to harvest. SGK1 activity was assayed with crosstide as substrate. E, activation of WNK1 by osmotic stress is insensitive to wortmannin (WM). The activity of endogenous WNK1 was measured in immunoprecipitates as autophosphorylation. Experiments were repeated two to four times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Activation of SGK1 by WNK1 Is Blocked by PI 3-Kinase Inhibitors—In our earlier studies we found that SGK1 is not a substrate of WNK1. To begin to probe the mechanism by which WNK1 increases SGK1 activity, we tested the effects of pharmacological inhibitors of MAPK pathways (Fig. 2, A and B). Co-expression of WNK1 with SGK1 increases SGK1 activity assayed with either recombinant Nedd4-2 or the synthetic peptide crosstide. We found previously that WNK1 stimulates ERK5 activity and has a weak effect on p38 MAPK (9Xu B. Stippec S. Lenertz L. Lee B.H. Zhang W. Lee Y.K. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7826-7831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Both of these pathways have been implicated in SGK1 regulation (22Hayashi M. Tapping R.I. Chao T.H.

Chem. 2003; 278: 5871-5882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). To inhibit the ERK5 pathway, we used U0126. U0126 inhibits the kinases upstream of ERK1/2 as well as ERK5 (26Kamakura S. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26563-26571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). We found that U0126 had no effect on the activation of SGK1 by WNK1 (Fig. 2A), which is consistent with findings that dominant negative mutants of MEKK2 and -3 did not block SGK1 activation by WNK1 (12Xu B. Stippec S. Chu P.-Y. Li X.-J. Lazrak A. Ortega B. Lee B.H. English J.M. Huang C.-L. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10315-10320Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Likewise, the p38 inhibitor SB203580 had no effect on the activation of SGK1 by WNK1 (Fig. 2B). The PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin blocks the activation of SGK1 by a number of hormones including IGF-1 (25Leong M.L. Maiyar A.C. Kim B. O'Keeffe B.A. Firestone G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5871-5882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Therefore we tested the effect of wortmannin and found that it substantially reduced the activation of SGK1 by WNK1 (Fig. 2, A and B). In confirmation of an earlier report (27Kobayashi T. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 28Park J. Leong M.L. Buse P. Maiyar A.C. Firestone G.L. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3024-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), we also found that the activation of SGK1 by PDK1 is not wortmannin-sensitive (Fig. 2C), indicating that this was not the site of action of PI 3-kinase. Activation of SGK1 by WNK1 was also blocked by another PI 3-kinase inhibitor, LY294002 (Fig. 2D). Activation of SGK1 by WNK1 might be inhibited by wortmannin if the activation of WNK1 itself is PI 3-kinase-dependent. To test this possibility, we examined the effect of wortmannin on the activation of WNK1 by osmotic stress, the only known type of WNK1 stimulus. WNK1 was stimulated 5-10-fold by 0.5 m NaCl (Fig. 2E). There was no effect of wortmannin on its activation. Thus, WNK1 activation apparently was also not a site of PI 3-kinase action. Activation of SGK1 and ENaC by WNK1 Requires Akt—PDK1 was originally identified as a protein kinase that phosphorylates Akt in a PI 3-kinase-dependent manner. Because SGK1 is phosphorylated by PDK1 independently of PI 3-kinase (27Kobayashi T. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C), we tested the possibility that PI 3-kinase exerted an effect required for the activation of SGK1 by WNK1 through the PI 3-kinase effector kinase Akt. A kinase-dead mutant of Akt reduced SGK1 activation by WNK1, whereas a kinase-dead mutant of the related kinase p70 had no effect (Fig. 3A). These data suggest that activation of SGK1 by WNK1 requires the catalytic activity of Akt. ENaC subunits were identified by expression cloning in Xenopus oocytes (29Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1787) Google Scholar). Thus, ENaC activity can be measured by reconstitution in oocytes, displaying the appropriate sensitivity to the ENaC-selective inhibitor amiloride. Co-expression of ENaC with WNK1 in oocytes stimulated ENaC activity (Fig. 3B) (12Xu B. Stippec S. Chu P.-Y. Li X.-J. Lazrak A. Ortega B. Lee B.H. English J.M. Huang C.-L. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10315-10320Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that stimulation of ENaC by WNK1 occurs via activation of endogenous SGK in oocytes (12Xu B. Stippec S. Chu P.-Y. Li X.-J. Lazrak A. Ortega B. Lee B.H. English J.M. Huang C.-L. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10315-10320Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Kinase-dead Akt blocks the effect of WNK1 on ENaC activity (Fig. 3B), consistent with its effect on SGK1 activation by WNK1. Because WNK1 did not activate Akt, Akt most likely acts upstream or in parallel with WNK1. Activation of SGK1 by WNK1 Is Increased by Phosphorylation of WNK1 Thr-58—WNK1 Thr-58 has been shown to be an IGF-1-stimulated site of Akt phosphorylation (30Vitari A.C. Deak M. Collins B.J. Morrice N. Prescott A.R. Phelan A. Humphreys S. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 257-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 31Jiang Z.Y. Zhou Q.L. Holik J. Patel S. Leszyk J. Coleman K. Chouinard M. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21622-21628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). We found that Akt as well as SGK1 itself phosphorylated WNK1 in vitro (Fig. 4B). Mutation of WNK1 Thr-58 to alanine reduced phosphorylation by Akt substantially and also reduced phosphorylation by SGK1, suggesting that SGK1 phosphorylates WNK1 not only on Thr-58 but also on additional sites. With an antibody generated against phospho-Thr-58 of WNK1, we found that WNK1-(1-491) was constitutively phosphorylated on Thr-58 in HEK293 cells and wortmannin reduced its phosphorylation (Fig. 4C). WNK1-(1-491) T58A and T58D were defective in activating SGK1 compared with wild type WNK1 (Fig. 4D), although partial activation of SGK1 was observed. These results indicate that phosphorylation of Thr-58 by either endogenous Akt or other kinases such as SGK isoforms enhance the activation of SGK1 by WNK1. Because the activation of Akt requires PI 3-kinase, the activation of SGK1 by WNK1 apparently requires PI 3-kinase activity to promote WNK1 Thr-58 phosphorylation by Akt. The phosphorylation of WNK1 by SGK1 may reflect positive feedback. WNK1 Activates SGK1 and ENaC by a Mechanism Independent of Its Kinase Activity—Because mutation of Thr-58 reduces the ability of WNK1 to activate SGK1, we determined whether the N-terminal region of WNK1 containing Thr-58 is required for SGK1 activation. We found that not only was the catalytic activity of WNK1 dispensable for its ability to activate SGK1 but the entire catalytic domain was also dispensable (Fig. 5, A and B). Instead, WNK1-(1-220) alone, which contains Thr-58 and additional residues preceding the kinase domain, was sufficient to activate SGK1 (Fig. 5B). We evaluated the relationship of these biochemical findings to increased ENaC-dependent sodium current and found that WNK1-(1-220) caused a similar activation of ENaC, whereas the kinase domain lacking the N-terminal residues had no effect (Fig. 6A). Consistent with results using longer fragments, mutation of Thr-58 reduced activation of SGK1 by WNK1-(1-220) (Fig. 5C). Likewise, mutation of Thr-58 greatly reduced the ability of WNK1-(1-491) and -(1-220) to activate ENaC (Fig. 6B). These findings clearly demonstrate that the N terminus of WNK1, when phosphorylated on Thr-58, is capable of activating SGK1 and ENaC independently of WNK1 catalytic activity.FIGURE 6WNK1 activation of ENaC is dependent on its N terminus. A, residues 1-220 of WNK1 are sufficient for the stimulation of ENaC. *, p < 0.05 versus ENaC alone. B, phosphorylation of Thr-58 is required for the activation of ENaC. *, p < 0.05 versus ENaC alone. Experiments were performed at least three times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) WNK1 Is Required for Activation of SGK1 by IGF-1—Thus far, we have shown that WNK1 is sufficient to activate SGK1. To address whether WNK1 is necessary for SGK1 activation by hormones, we knocked down WNK1 expression by small interfering RNA and examined SGK1 activity (Fig. 7A). In the presence of WNK1, IGF-1 treatment led to 3-4-fold increase in SGK1 activity. When WNK1 expression was reduced by using double-stranded RNA oligonucleotides, IGF-1 failed to activate SGK1 significantly. This is strong evidence that WNK1 is required for SGK1 activation by IGF-1. As a control to demonstrate that IGF-1 action had not been generally disrupted, we also examined the activation state of Akt in the same cells. As shown in Fig. 7B, Akt activation, as indicated by anti-phospho-Thr-308 and anti-phospho-Ser-473 immunoblots, was not altered by the depletion of WNK1. WNK1 activates the protein kinase SGK1 in a manner that leads to increased ENaC-mediated sodium transport (12Xu B. Stippec S. Chu P.-Y. Li X.-J. Lazrak A. Ortega B. Lee B.H. English J.M. Huang C.-L. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10315-10320Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Over-expression of WNK1 is sufficient to activate SGK1, and expression of endogenous WNK1 is required for the stimulation of SGK1 activity by IGF-1. Activation by WNK1 requires phosphorylation of SGK1. Although WNK1 binds SGK1 directly, WNK1 does not phosphorylate it. Thus, we have evaluated other potential mechanisms of SGK1 activation. Experiments thus far indicate no relationship to MAPK cascades. WNK1 has some similarities to the Ste20p family, many of which activate MAPK kinase kinases either by phosphorylation or through association. WNK1, like Ste20ps, has some capacity to activate the MAPK kinase kinase MEKK3. We showed previously, however, that MEKK3 is not involved in SGK1 activation (12Xu B. Stippec S. Chu P.-Y. Li X.-J. Lazrak A. Ortega B. Lee B.H. English J.M. Huang C.-L. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10315-10320Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). p38 and ERK5, both of which can be activated by MEKK3, have been implicated in the regulation of SGK1 in certain contexts (22Hayashi M.

We find, however, that neither of these nor ERK1/2 MAPKs are involved in SGK1 activation by WNK1. Our results suggest that the PI 3-kinase pathway is essential for WNK1 action. PI 3-kinase activity is not required to activate the kinase activity of WNK1 because inhibition of PI 3-kinase does not interfere with the activation of WNK1 by osmotic stress. However, Akt does phosphorylate WNK1 on Thr-58, a site that has little or no effect on the kinase activity of WNK1 (30Vitari A.C. Deak M. Collins B.J. Morrice N. Prescott A.R. Phelan A. Humphreys S. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 257-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 31Jiang Z.Y. Zhou Q.L. Holik J. Patel S. Leszyk J. Coleman K. Chouinard M. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21622-21628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We propose that phosphorylation of WNK1 Thr-58 by Akt is the PI 3-kinase-dependent step in the mechanism underlying the activation of SGK1. Previous work on SGK1 has shown that, like Akt, it is activated by phosphorylation on the two well described activating phosphorylation sites, a residue in the activation loop Thr-256 of SGK1 and a second site in a C-terminal hydrophobic motif, SGK1 Ser-422 (28Park J. Leong M.L. Buse P. Maiyar A.C. Firestone G.L. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3024-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). We found that activation of SGK1 by WNK1 required phosphorylation of these two sites. PDK1 is thought to be the activation loop kinase based on biochemical analysis (27Kobayashi T. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 28Park J. Leong M.L. Buse P. Maiyar A.C. Firestone G.L. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3024-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). The kinase(s) responsible for phosphorylating the other SGK1 site is unknown, and WNK1 may not have a major effect on Ser-422 phosphorylation; although the S422D mutant of SGK1 was slightly more active than the wild type enzyme, it retained the ability to be activated by co-expression with WNK1 (12Xu B. Stippec S. Chu P.-Y. Li X.-J. Lazrak A. Ortega B. Lee B.H. English J.M. Huang C.-L. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10315-10320Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). This suggests that WNK1 is involved in promoting phosphorylation of the SGK1 activation loop site. On the basis of our results, we propose that WNK1 and PDK1 cooperate to activate SGK1 (Fig. 8). This mechanism is unique to SGK family members and is not involved in regulating related kinases such as p70 S6 kinase. A PI 3-kinase-dependent step is involved not at the level of PDK1 but because of a requirement for phosphorylation of WNK1 on Thr-58. In this model, IGF-1 induces SGK1 activation by stimulating WNK1 phosphorylation on this site. In our model, the role of Thr-58 does not preclude the possibility that there are additional PI 3-kinase-sensitive components required for SGK1 activation. How Thr-58 phosphorylation of WNK1 promotes SGK1 activation is not apparent. Because WNK1 binds to SGK1, WNK1 may serve as a scaffold to assemble a protein complex required for efficient SGK1 activation. Phospho-Thr-58 may create a binding site for proteins involved in SGK1 activation or induce a conformational change in SGK1 that is permissive for its activation. To date, however, we have been unable to induce SGK1 activation in vitro or in extracts by adding WNK1 under phosphorylating conditions. Thus, it seems likely that additional components are necessary to mediate SGK1 activation. A screen of consensus phosphorylation sites indicates that WNK1 Thr-58 may also be a substrate for cAMP-dependent protein kinase, calcium- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, several protein kinase C species (scansite.mit.edu), and probably additional AGC family members. These enzymes most likely account for the residual phosphorylation on WNK1 Thr-58 in cells treated with wortmannin to inhibit PI 3-kinase and may allow other hormonal systems to potentiate SGK1 activation and the subsequent activation of ENaC. SGK1 itself may provide a feed forward mechanism to enhance its activation by further phosphorylating WNK1 on Thr-58.

https://openalex.org/W2023020448,"Fibonacci number patterns and triangular patterns with intrinsic defects occur frequently on nonplanar surfaces in nature, particularly in plants. By controlling the geometry and the stress upon cooling, these patterns can be reproduced on the surface of microstructures about 10 micrometers in diameter. Spherules of the Ag core/SiO x shell structure, possessing markedly uniform size and shape, self-assembled into the Fibonacci number patterns (5 by 8 and 13 by 21) or the triangular pattern, depending on the geometry of the primary supporting surface. Under proper geometrical constraints, the patterns developed through self-assembly in order to minimize the total strain energy.

https://openalex.org/W2069211473,"We previously noted strong induction of genes related to intestinal copper homeostasis (Menkes Copper ATPase (Atp7a) and metallothionein) in the duodenal epithelium of iron-deficient rats across several stages of postnatal development (Collins, J. F., Franck, C. A., Kowdley, K. V., and Ghishan, F. K. (2005) Am. J. Physiol., 288, G964–G971). We now report significant copper loading in the livers and intestines of iron-deficient rats. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that there is increased intestinal copper transport during iron deficiency. We additionally found that hepatic Atp7b gene expression does not change with iron deficiency, suggesting that liver copper excretion is not altered. We have developed polyclonal antibodies against rat ATP7A, and we demonstrate the specificity of the immunogenic reaction. We show that the ATP7A protein is present on apical domains of duodenal enterocytes in control rats and on brush-border and basolateral membrane domains in iron-deprived rats. This localization is surprising, as previous in vitro studies have suggested that ATP7A traffics between the trans-Golgi network and the basolateral membrane. We further demonstrate that ATP7A protein levels are dramatically increased in brush-border and basolateral membrane vesicles isolated from iron-deficient rats. Other experiments show that iron refeeding partially corrects the hematological abnormalities seen in iron-deficient rats but that it does not ameliorate ATP7A protein induction, suggesting that Atp7a does not respond to intracellular iron levels. We conclude that ATP7A is involved in copper loading observed during iron deficiency and that increased intestinal copper transport is of physiological relevance, as copper plays important roles in overall body iron homeostasis.

Iron is a component of many proteins that are involved in cellular growth and metabolism. Complex homeostatic mechanisms exist to ensure that adequate iron is available for normal physiological functions while simultaneously avoiding excessive iron accumulation in body tissues. Free iron is highly reactive and is prone to catalyze the formation of toxic oxygen radicals via the Fenton reaction (1Hentze M.W. Muckenthaler M.U. Andrews N.C. Cell. 2004; 117: 285-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar).

Furthermore, iron deficiency is a major clinical issue, likely afflicting billions of people worldwide, including a large number of people in developed countries such as the United States (3Baltussen R.

Once iron has been transported into the cell, it becomes part of the cytosolic iron pool, where it is available for metabolic processes, or is stored in the cytoplasm within ferritin complexes. According to the body's needs, various amounts of free iron traverse the cytoplasm and are transported across the basolateral membrane by the iron exporter ferroportin (10Abboud S. Haile D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19906-19912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar, 11McKie A.T. Marciani P. Rolfs A. Brennan K. Wehr K. Barrow D. Miret S. Bomford A. Peters T.J.

In addition to ferroportin, hephaestin (HP) is required for iron transport across the BLM of enterocytes, and it is believed to oxidize Fe2+ to Fe3+ as iron is exported from the cell. Subsequently, oxidized iron can then interact with transferrin in the interstitial fluid, an interaction that mediates iron distribution to cells of the body via the circulatory system. brush-border membrane divalent metal transporter 1 hephaestin ceruloplasmin basolateral membrane vesicles duodenal cytochrome b Menkes Copper ATPase Intestinal iron transport is known to be the “checkpoint” of body iron homeostasis; as such, several physiological effectors are known to modulate this important process. These include erythroid, hypoxia, and inflammatory and stores regulators of intestinal iron transport (1Hentze M.W. Muckenthaler M.U. Andrews N.C. Cell. 2004; 117: 285-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar). We now have some insight into how these various stimuli lead to concerted changes in iron homeostasis and affect intestinal iron transport. Current evidence suggests that all of these physiological cues may modulate the production of hepcidin, a circulating peptide hormone produced by the liver that has pronounced effects on intestinal iron transport (12Park C.H. Valore E.V. Waring A.J. Ganz T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7806-7810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1775) Google Scholar, 13Pigeon C. Ilyin G. Courselaud B. Leroyer P. Turlin B. Brissot P. Loreal O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7811-7819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1424) Google Scholar). Hepcidin expression may be altered dramatically in response to several known stimuli that alter iron absorption. Conditions that lead to increased iron transport (e.g. iron deficiency, anemia, hypoxia) signal to decrease hepcidin production, whereas conditions that lead to decreased intestinal iron transport (e.g. iron overload, inflammation) induce its expression (14Nicolas G. Chauvet C. Viatte L. Danan J.L. Bigard X. Devaux I. Beaumont C. Kahn A. Vaulont S. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1037-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar, 15Weinstein D.A. Roy C.N.

Andrews N.C. Hentze M.W. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 102-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Recent in vitro observations have shown that hepcidin binds to the ferroportin protein on the plasma membrane of target cells to induce endocytosis and lysosomal degradation (17Nemeth E. Tuttle M.S. Powelson J. Vaughn M.B. Donovan A. Ward D.M. Ganz T. Kaplan J. Science. 2004; 306: 2090-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (3682) Google Scholar), although other iron transport-related proteins may also be regulated by hepcidin. The iron overload phenotypes of animals and humans deficient in hepcidin further strengthen the supposition that this peptide hormone is a negative regulator of intestinal iron absorption (18Nicolas G. Bennoun M. Devaux I. Beaumont C. Grandchamp B. Kahn A. Vaulont S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8780-8785Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar, 19Roetto A. Papanikolaou G. Politou M. Alberti F. Girelli D. Christakis J. Loukopoulos D. Camaschella C. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 21-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). Furthermore, laboratory rodents overexpressing hepcidin develop a severe anemic phenotype with systemic iron deficiency (20Nicolas G. Bennoun M. Porteu A. Mativet S. Beaumont C. Grandchamp B. Sirito M. Sawadogo M. Kahn A. Vaulont S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4596-4601Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). Thus, current evidence strongly suggests that hepcidin is a key modulator of intestinal iron transport, a finding that further links intestinal transport with regulation of overall body iron homeostasis. Copper, like iron, is an essential micronutrient, as demonstrated by nutritional deficiencies and rare genetic disorders (21Harris Z.L. Klomp L.W. Gitlin J.D. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1998; 67: 972S-977SCrossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 22Bull P.C. Cox D.W. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 246-252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Copper is essential for many physiological processes, including pigmentation, neurotransmitter synthesis, free radical detoxification, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, hemoglobin synthesis, iron metabolism, and intestinal iron transport (23Harris E.D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 291-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Recently, a homolog of the yeast Copper Transporter 1 (CTR1) has been identified in mammalian cells (24Zhou B. Gitschier J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7481-7486Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), and it may play a role in the uptake of dietary copper across the apical membrane of enterocytes. However, CTR1 inactivation in mice leads to embryonic lethality (49Ghishan F.K. Wilson F.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 248: G87-G92PubMed Google Scholar, 52Kikuchi K. Ghishan F.K. Gastroenterology. 1987; 93: 106-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), so this possibility remains unproven. There is also in vitro experimental evidence that DMT1 may play a role in brush-border copper transport (25Arredondo M. Munoz P. Mura C.V. Nunez M.T. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C1525-C1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Additionally, recent studies suggest that intestinal copper transport is mediated by an unidentified copper ATPase expressed in the apical membrane of intestinal epithelial cells (26Knopfel M. Smith C. Solioz M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 330: 645-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Once copper enters enterocytes, it may be sequestered in metallothionein (27Williams L.M. Cunningham H. Ghaffar A. Riddoch G.I. Bremner I. Toxicology. 1989; 55: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 28Dameron C.T. Harrison M.D. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1998; 67: 1091S-1097SCrossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 29Kelly E.J. Palmiter R.D. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), or it may traverse the cytoplasm bound to chaperone proteins and be pumped across the basolateral membrane by the copper ATPase (ATP7A), the mutant gene in Menkes disease (30Vulpe C.D. Packman S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1995; 15: 293-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Once copper exits the basal membrane of enterocytes, it is bound to ceruloplasmin (CP), which presumably oxidizes toxic ferrous iron to the ferric form and also functions to distribute copper to the rest of the body via the circulatory system. Cp is thought to play a role in iron release from some tissues, including the liver (31Mukhopadhyay C.K. Attieh Z.K. Fox P.L. Science. 1998; 279: 714-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 32Young S.P. Fahmy M. Golding S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and recent studies suggest it may also be important for intestinal iron transport (33Cherukuri, S., Potla, R., Nurko, S., and Fox, P. L. (2005) First Congress of the International BioIron Society, Prague, Czech Republic, May 22–26, 2005, p. 35, International BioIron Society, Schaumburg, ILGoogle Scholar). The interplay of copper and iron homeostasis has been recognized for more than 150 years, and both trace minerals are required to prevent anemia (34Fox P.L. Biometals. 2003; 16: 9-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). This observation has now been confirmed at the molecular level with the discovery of CP and HP, which are multicopper ferroxidases that play roles in iron export from some tissue types (12Park C.H. Valore E.V. Waring A.J. Ganz T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7806-7810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1775) Google Scholar). CP is a circulating ferroxidase of hepatic origin, and HP is a membrane-anchored ferroxidase that is important for iron release from duodenal enterocytes. The exact role of CP in intestinal iron absorption has not been resolved conclusively (34Fox P.L. Biometals. 2003; 16: 9-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), although some experimental results have shown a positive effect of CP on iron release from enterocytes (35Wollenberg P. Mahlberg R. Rummel W. Biol. Met. 1990; 3: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Recently, the CP gene was disrupted in mice in an effort to produce an animal model of aceruloplasminemia, which is the lack of CP (17Nemeth E. Tuttle M.S. Powelson J. Vaughn M.B. Donovan A. Ward D.M. Ganz T. Kaplan J. Science. 2004; 306: 2090-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (3682) Google Scholar). The authors of this study concluded that CP loss did not affect intestinal iron absorption, but the low number of mice used and their mixed genetic backgrounds could not rule out an effect of CP on this important physiological process (36Harris Z.L. Durley A.P. Man T.K. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10812-10817Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). However, very recent evidence suggests that CP may be important for intestinal iron transport under conditions of increased erythropoiesis (33Cherukuri, S., Potla, R., Nurko, S., and Fox, P. L. (2005) First Congress of the International BioIron Society, Prague, Czech Republic, May 22–26, 2005, p. 35, International BioIron Society, Schaumburg, ILGoogle Scholar). Furthermore, in sex-linked anemic mice, which have inactivating mutations in the HP gene, anemia is seen in younger animals but the anemia is resolved as the animals age, suggesting that another gene becomes active and compensates for the loss of HP (37Vulpe C.D. Kuo Y.M. Murphy T.L. Cowley L. Askwith C. Libina N. Gitschier J. Anderson G.J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). Our previous studies led us to the discovery that the Menkes copper ATPase is a novel, metal-responsive gene that is strongly induced at the mRNA level by iron deprivation in the duodenum and jejunum of rats at different stages of postnatal development (38Collins J.F. Franck C.A. Kowdley K.V. Ghishan F.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: G964-G971Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 39Collins J.F. Biol. Res. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar). This finding was of particular interest as copper is known to have the following profound effects on body iron homeostasis: 1) copper is necessary for intestinal iron transport via HP and possibly CP, 2) copper is necessary for iron release from body iron stores in the liver, spleen, and reticuloendothelial macrophages, and 3) copper is necessary for hemoglobin production. Thus, in the current report, we have expanded upon these previous observations to demonstrate that iron-deficient rats have significantly increased intestinal and liver copper levels, suggesting that they absorb increased amounts of dietary copper. Importantly, we have also shown that ATP7A protein expression is also strongly induced by iron deficiency and that the ATP7A protein is present on both brush-border and basolateral domains of duodenal enterocytes. We have further provided experimental evidence that ATP7A induction during iron deficiency is not ameliorated by iron refeeding and partial correction of hematological parameters. Animal Studies—Sprague-Dawley rats at different stages of postnatal developmental were placed on modified AIN-93G rodent diets that contained either 198 ppm Fe (control diet with the same Fe content as normal rodent chow) or 3 ppm Fe (low Fe diet) for various periods of time (as described in detail previously) (38Collins J.F. Franck C.A. Kowdley K.V. Ghishan F.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: G964-G971Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The diets were identical except for the addition of pure ferric citrate to the control Fe diet, and they both had standard copper levels. Suckling (8 days), weanling (21 days), and adolescent (6 weeks) rats were made iron deficient by feeding dams the low Fe diet throughout part or all of gestation and lactation. Soon after birth, litter sizes were normalized by cross-fostering the pups to different dams to maintain a constant dam:pup ratio. For the production of 9- and 12-week-old iron-deficient rats, weaned rats at 3 weeks of age were placed on the control or low diet for 6–9 weeks, respectively. Some rats were also placed on the diets for 1 year beginning at 8 weeks of age. Livers and intestines were removed from control and iron-deficient rats, and copper and iron analysis was performed by flame atomic absorption spectrometry. Western Blot Analyses—Brush-border membrane vesicles were prepared by the Mg2+ precipitation method (40Acra S. Ghishan F.K.

Membrane proteins were solubilized in Laemmli buffer plus βME, boiled for 5 min, and then separated by SDS/PAGE followed by electroblotting onto nitrocellulose membranes. Western blots were processed as described previously (41Collins J.F. Xu H. Kiela P.R. Zeng J. Ghishan F.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1937-C1946Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 61Collins J.F.

We sought to develop a useful antiserum against the rat ATP7A protein to perform quantitative immunoblot and immunolocalization studies in rat intestine. We were unable to find any published reports of ATP7A antiserum for rat or any commercially available reagents, and surprisingly, we discovered that this protein has never been definitively localized in the mammalian intestine. We thus identified two hydrophilic, potentially antigenic sites in the rat Menkes protein and had two peptides synthesized and co-injected into two rabbits. One site was the carboxyl terminus, and the other was from within the amino-terminal region. The peptide sequences were as follows: NH2-KHSLLVGDFREDDDTTL-COOH, and NH2-KKDRSANHLDHKRE-COOH. Rabbits were immunized three times, and a 10-week bleed was utilized for the experiments that are described in this report. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay data showed that there was a strong immunogenic response to the carboxyl-terminal peptide in both rabbits, with little immune response generated against the amino-terminal peptide (data not shown). For some experiments, pre-immune serum was utilized, and in others, peptide-blocked antiserum was utilized (see details in the legend of Fig. 5). Immunohistochemical Analysis of Rat Duodenum—Transverse sections (2–4 mm in width) were taken from mid-duodenum of iron-deficient and control rats and were placed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline overnight at 4 °C. Tissue samples were then transferred to 70% ethanol and embedded in paraffin. 6-μm sections were subsequently cut and affixed to microscope slides. Tissue sections were deparrafinized, blocked, and processed with ATP7A antiserum at a 1:100 dilution by standard methods (41Collins J.F. Xu H. Kiela P.R. Zeng J. Ghishan F.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1937-C1946Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 63Xu H. Uno J.K. Inouye M. Xu L. Drees J.B. Collins J.F. Ghishan F.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: G1317-G1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A fluorescent-tagged secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) conjugate; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was utilized at a 1:400 dilution. Staining was visualized by laser scanning confocal microscopy (Bio-Rad MRC 1024) with a 568-nm excitation wavelength and a HQ 598 40 emission filter. Pre-immune serum was also utilized for some experiments. Iron-deficient rats at the three younger ages were smaller than controls; however, 12-week- and 1-year-old rats were not (data not shown). Phenotype observation and blood analysis of the rats revealed that iron-deprived rats at 8 days, 21 days, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks of age showed signs of hypochromic, microcytic anemia (38Collins J.F. Franck C.A. Kowdley K.V. Ghishan F.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: G964-G971Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) (data not shown). However, the 1-year and 8-week-old rats, despite being deprived of dietary iron for 1 year showed no differences between control and iron-deprived groups in any parameters measured with the complete blood count blood test (although there was a non-statistical trend in that direction). We also noted that iron-deficient rats at different developmental stages had significantly increased liver copper levels (Fig. 1), whereas liver iron levels were decreased as expected. The liver iron content was as follows (in ppm): for 21-day-old control rats 171.2 ± 14.85 and iron-deficient rats 19.7 ± 0.96 (n = 10/group, p <0.001); for 1-year and 8-week-old control rats 265.2 ± 35 and iron-deprived rats 58.5 ± 16 for (n = 5/group, p <0.001). We also measured duodenal and jejunal copper levels by flame atomic absorption spectrometry and found that the intestines of 12-week-old control rats had much lower copper levels than those harvested from iron-deficient rats (in ppm: duodenum, 0.21 ± 0.014 for controls versus 0.82 ± 0.01 for iron-deficient rats, n = 3/group, p <0.004; jejunum, 0.53 ± 0.007 for controls versus 0.89 ± 0.08 for iron-deficient rats, n = 2–3/group, p = 0.007). Furthermore, as body copper levels are known to be principally regulated at the level of excretion in the bile, as mediated by the Wilson's copper ATPase (ATP7B), we performed real-time PCR experiments for Atp7b expression in control and iron-deficient rats at different ages. Our studies showed that there were no alterations in Atp7b mRNA expression between groups (data not shown), suggesting that liver copper excretion was not altered with iron deficiency. We next performed Western blot analysis of DMT1 protein expression in iron-deficient rats at 6 and 12 weeks of age (Fig. 2). These experiments showed strong induction of DMT1 expression by iron deficiency in duodenum with little expression in jejunum, as reported by others previously (64Trinder D. Oates P.S. Thomas C. Sadleir J. Morgan E.H. Gut. 2000; 46: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 65Zoller H. Koch R.O. Theurl I. Obrist P. Pietrangelo A. Montosi G. Haile D.J. Vogel W. Weiss G. Gastroenterology. 2001; 120: 1412-1419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Interestingly, four transcript splice variants of Dmt1 have been described in the literature, two 5′- and two 3′-variants. Each of these variants presumably encodes slightly different sized DMT1 proteins. Our data thus suggest that more than one of these variants is likely induced by our dietary feeding strategy, as multiple DMT1 bands could be seen on Westerns. Furthermore, post-translational modification of DMT1 likely occurs, and many investigators have also detected multiple DMT1 bands on immunoblots. These studies also showed that rats were indeed iron deficient, as rats with normal iron status have little detectable DMT1 protein. Furthermore, these immunoblots demonstrate the fact that our brush-border membrane preparation method is indeed highly enriched for brush-border membranes, as this is where DMT1 is expressed within enterocytes. Importantly, this same vesicle purification method was utilized for Western blot analysis of ATP7A protein expression, which led us to the novel observation that ATP7A is expressed on the apical membra"

The Arabidopsis thaliana genome encodes seven putative diacylglycerol kinase isozymes (named AtDGK1 to -7), structurally falling into three major clusters. So far, enzymatic activity has not been reported for any plant Cluster II DGK. Here, we demonstrate that a representative of this cluster, AtDGK7, is biochemically active when expressed as a recombinant protein in Escherichia coli. AtDGK7, encoded by gene locus At4g30340, contains 374 amino acids with an apparent molecular mass of 41.2 kDa. AtDGK7 harbors an N-terminal catalytic domain, but in contrast to various characterized DGKs (including AtDGK2), it lacks a cysteine-rich domain at its N terminus, and, importantly, its C-terminal DGK accessory domain is incomplete. Recombinant AtDGK7 expressed in E. coli exhibits Michaelis-Menten type kinetics with 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol as substrate. AtDGK7 activity was affected by pH, detergents, and the DGK inhibitor R59022. We demonstrate that both AtDGK2 and AtDGK7 phosphorylate diacylglycerol molecular species that are typically found in plants, indicating that both enzymes convert physiologically relevant substrates. AtDGK7 is expressed throughout the Arabidopsis plant, but expression is strongest in flowers and young seedlings. Expression of AtDGK2 is transiently induced by wounding. R59022 at ∼80 μm inhibits root elongation and lateral root formation and reduces plant growth, indicating that DGKs play an important role in plant development.

We demonstrate that both AtDGK2 and AtDGK7 phosphorylate diacylglycerol molecular species that are typically found in plants, indicating that both enzymes convert physiologically relevant substrates. AtDGK7 is expressed throughout the Arabidopsis plant, but expression is strongest in flowers and young seedlings. Expression of AtDGK2 is transiently induced by wounding. R59022 at ∼80 μm inhibits root elongation and lateral root formation and reduces plant growth, indicating that DGKs play an important role in plant development. Lipid second messengers, generated in response to diverse stimuli through the activity of lipid kinases and phospholipases, are involved in a variety of biological responses in plant cells (1Meijer H.J.G. Munnik T. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2003; 54: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 2Wang X. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2004; 7: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Diacylglycerol kinase (EC 2.7.1.107) is a lipid kinase that phosphorylates diacylglycerol (DAG) 5The abbreviations and trivial names used are: DAG, diacylglycerol; EST, expressed sequence tag; Bis-Tris, bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-imino-tris(hydroxymethyl)methane; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; Na-DC, sodium deoxycholate; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate; 1,2-SAG, 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol; 1,2-DOG, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol; 1,2-POG, 1-palmitoyl, 2-oleoyl-sn-glycerol; 1,2-SLG, 1-stearoyl, 2-linoleoyl-sn-glycerol; 1,2-OPG, 1,2-1-oleoyl, 2-palmitoyl-sn-glycerol; PA, phosphatidic acid; CaM, calmodulin; RT, reverse transcription; R59022, 6-{2-{4-[(4-fluorophenyl)phenylmethylene]-1-piperidinyl}ethyl}-7-methyl-5H-thiazolo(3,2-α)pyrimidine-5-one; R59949, 3-{2-{4-[bis-(4-fluorophenyl)methylene]-1-piperidinyl}ethyl}-2,3-dihydro-2-thioxo-4(1H)-quinazolinone; MPSS, massively parallel signature sequencing; TPM, transcripts/million; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. 5The abbreviations and trivial names used are: DAG, diacylglycerol; EST, expressed sequence tag; Bis-Tris, bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-imino-tris(hydroxymethyl)methane; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; Na-DC, sodium deoxycholate; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate; 1,2-SAG, 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol; 1,2-DOG, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol; 1,2-POG, 1-palmitoyl, 2-oleoyl-sn-glycerol; 1,2-SLG, 1-stearoyl, 2-linoleoyl-sn-glycerol; 1,2-OPG, 1,2-1-oleoyl, 2-palmitoyl-sn-glycerol; PA, phosphatidic acid; CaM, calmodulin; RT, reverse transcription; R59022, 6-{2-{4-[(4-fluorophenyl)phenylmethylene]-1-piperidinyl}ethyl}-7-methyl-5H-thiazolo(3,2-α)pyrimidine-5-one; R59949, 3-{2-{4-[bis-(4-fluorophenyl)methylene]-1-piperidinyl}ethyl}-2,3-dihydro-2-thioxo-4(1H)-quinazolinone; MPSS, massively parallel signature sequencing; TPM, transcripts/million; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. to yield phosphatidic acid (PA) in a reaction that uses ATP as phosphate donor. In plants, both DAG and PA may have signaling functions. DAG has been demonstrated to activate both ion pumping in patch-clamped guard cell protoplasts and opening of stomata (3Lee Y. Assmann S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2127-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), whereas PA accumulates in response to different kinds of stresses and regulates the activity of several enzymes (4Munnik T. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 227-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar).Various PA targets have been identified in plants, including, for example, Arabidopsis phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (5Deak M. Casamayor A. Currie R.A. Downes C.P. Alessi D.R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and a calcium-dependent protein kinase from carrot (6Farmer P.K. Choi J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1434: 6-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Recently, using PA affinity chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, PA-binding proteins were identified in plants, including phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, Hsp90, 14-3-3 proteins, and others (7Testerink C. Dekker H.L. Lim Z.Y. Johns M.K. Holmes A.B. Koster C.G. Ktistakis N.T. Munnik T. Plant J. 2004; 39: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), providing new entries into the field of plant PA research. Furthermore, Zhang et al. (8Zhang Q. Qin C. Zhao J. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9508-9513Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that PA interacts with ABI1 phosphatase 2C, thereby regulating abscisic acid signaling in Arabidopsis thaliana.Animal DGKs have been extensively studied, and models for their function have been elaborated (9Topham M.K. Prescott S.M. Thromb. Haemost. 2002; 88: 912-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 10Martelli A.M. Bortul R. Tabellini G. Bareggi R. Manzoli L. Narducci P. Cocco L. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1129-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). DGK activity has also been reported in several plant species, including Catharanthus roseus, tobacco, wheat, tomato, and Arabidopsis (11Heim S. Bauleke A. Wylegalla C. Wagner K.G. Plant Sci. 1987; 49: 159-165Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 12Kamada Y. Muto S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1093: 72-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 13Wissing J.B. Wagner K.G.

Acta. 1992; 1123: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 15Snedden W.A. Blumwald E. Plant J. 2000; 24: 317-326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Gómez-Merino F.C. Ornatowska M. Abdel-Haliem M.E.F. Zanor M.-I. Mueller-Roeber B. Schnarrenberger C. Wittmann-Liebold B. Proceedings of the XIIth Congress on Genes, Gene Families, and Isozymes. Monduzzi Editore, Bologna, Italy2003: 247-250Google Scholar), and molecular data bases reveal that they are present in a number of other crop plants such as rice, maize, grape, sweet orange, and cotton. However, functional analysis of DGK genes is still fragmentary. Two DGK cDNAs, LeDGK1 and LeCBDGK, respectively, have been cloned from tomato (15Snedden W.A. Blumwald E. Plant J. 2000; 24: 317-326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The two enzymes are derived from the same gene via alternative splicing and are identical except for a 29-amino acid-long C-terminal extension in the case of LeCBDGK, which represents a calmodulin (CaM)-binding domain. The two proteins lack the cysteine-rich domain (CRD) present in other eukaryotic DGKs, but are active in vitro. LeCBDGK is found both in association with membranes and in soluble cell extracts. The Ca2+/CaM-dependent translocation of LeCBDGK to its membrane-associated substrate DAG might represent a means of activation in vivo, analogous to the Ca2+-dependent translocation of certain mammalian DGKs. In contrast, LeDGK1 only associates with the membrane fraction, via a Ca2+/CaM-independent mechanism, which might represent a means of encoding specificity in cellular responses by alternative splicing (15Snedden W.A. Blumwald E. Plant J. 2000; 24: 317-326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In A. thaliana, seven candidate genes (named AtDGK1 to -7) encode putative DGK isoforms. The AtDGK1 cDNA has been isolated and reported to be mainly expressed in roots, shoots, and leaves, but its enzyme product was not active in vitro (17Katagiri T. Mizoguchi T. Shinozaki K. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 647-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We have previously cloned the AtDGK2 cDNA and demonstrated that its encoded enzyme is catalytically active. AtDGK2 transcripts are found in the whole plant except in stems and are induced by exposure to 4 °C, pointing to a role in cold signal transduction (18Gómez-Merino F.C. Brearley C.A. Ornatowska M. Abdel-Haliem M.E.F. Zanor M.I. Mueller-Roeber B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8230-8241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). AtDGK1 and -2 share a similar domain organization and fall into the Cluster I of plant DGKs.Here we report the molecular cloning and characterization of AtDGK7, which encodes an enzyme structurally belonging to the Cluster II of plant DGKs. The AtDGK7 gene is transcribed throughout the plant and most prominently in flowers and young tissues. Recombinant AtDGK7 enzyme is catalytically active and, importantly, accepts DAG molecular species containing at least one saturated fatty acid as the preferred substrate. We also demonstrate that both AtDGK2 and AtDGK7 are able to phosphorylate DAG molecular species that are typically found in plants, indicating that both enzymes convert physiologically relevant substrates. The DGK inhibitor 6-{2-{4-[(4-fluorophenyl)phenylmethylene]-1-piperidinyl}ethyl}-7-methyl-5H-thiazolo(3,2-α)pyrimidine-5-one (R59022) at around 50-100 μm inhibits recombinant AtDGK2 in vitro. It also modifies root growth within the same concentration range, indicating the involvement of this enzyme in developmental processes. In contrast, AtDGK7 was found to be affected by R59022 only at concentrations above 100 μm.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneral—Manipulation and analysis of nucleic acids were performed according to standard molecular-biological techniques described (19Sambrook J. Russell D. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar). Restriction enzymes were purchased from Roche Applied Science (Mannheim, Germany) and New England Biolabs (Frankfurt am Main, Germany). Oligonucleotides were obtained from TibMolbiol (Berlin, Germany) or Eurogentec (Cologne, Germany). DNA sequencing was performed by SeqLab (Göttingen, Germany). Unless otherwise indicated, other chemicals were purchased from Roche Applied Science, Merck, or Sigma. Escherichia coli strain XL-1 Blue (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany) was employed for general DNA work. For sequence analyses, the tools provided by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (available on the World Wide Web at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), the ExPASy Molecular Biology Server (available on the World Wide Web at us.expasy.org/), and The Arabidopsis Information Resource (available on the World Wide Web at www.arabidopsis.org/) were used. Gene expression data obtained through Affymetrix Gene-Chip hybridizations were retrieved using the software tools of the Genevestigator package (available on the World Wide Web at www.genevestigator.ethz.ch), version of July 2004. Massively parallel signature sequencing data were retrieved from the Arabidopsis massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS) data base (available on the World Wide Web at mpss.udel.edu/at/java.html), version of August 2004.Cloning of AtDGK7 cDNA—PCR amplification of the AtDGK7 cDNA was carried out using the Advantage-HF2 PCR kit (Clontech, Heidelberg, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. A. thaliana (L.) Heynh. Col-0 flower cDNA was used as template. Primer sequences were as follows: AtDGK7-F, 5′-GCGGATCCTGATGGAGGAGACGCCGAGATC-3′; AtDGK7-R, 5′-GCGCTCGAGTTATATGAACCTCTTAGGAAC-3′. Reaction details were as follows: 95 °C for 3 min; 36 cycles of 95 °C for 45 s, 62 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 72 s; 72 °C for 10 min. PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Individual fragments were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and subcloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega, Mannheim, Germany), generating the plasmid pG7. The entire AtDGK7 cDNA, present in plasmid pG7, had a length of 1125 bp (deposited under GenBank™ accession number AY686593).Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was digested with DNase I, RNase Free (Roche Applied Sciences, Mannheim, Germany). The absence of genomic DNA contamination was subsequently confirmed by PCR, using primers annealing to an intron of actin 2 (At3g18780) as a control gene, or alternatively, with primers LEH-fw (5′-AACAGCAACAACAATGCAACTACTGATT-3′) and LEH-rev (5′-ACAAACAGAGACAAGAGACAAGACATGG-3′), that span an intron of the Arabidopsis late elongated hypocotyl 1 gene encoding a Myb transcription factor. In some cases, genomic PCR products appeared after 35 amplification cycles, and such samples were discarded. RNA integrity was confirmed on 1.5% (w/v) agarose gel prior to and after DNase I digestion. Reverse transcriptase reactions were performed with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) or Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Real time RT-PCR was performed with 1 μl of a 1:2 dilution of the first strand cDNA reaction and SYBR Green reagent (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in a 20-μl volume, on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Geneamp 7300 machine, with the following primer pairs: ACTIN2, actin-fw (5′-ATGGCTGAGGCTGATGATATTCAAC-3′) and actin-rev (5′-TACAAGGAGAGAACAGCTTGGATG-3′); polyubiqutin UBQ10, UBQ-fw (5′-ATGCAGATCTTTGTTAAGACTCTCAC-3′) and UBQ-rev (5′-ATAGTCTTTCCGGTGAGAGTCTTC-3′); AtDGK2, AtDGK2-fw (5′-AAGCAAGTCTCGGACATGCCT-3′) and AtDGK2-rev (5′-TTCGTTTGTGCCCGCCTAT-3′); AtDGK7, AtDGK7F-RT (5′-TGTGGACTTAGCATCACAGG-3′) and AtDGK7R-RT (5′-AGCTGAGAGTCTGTCAAGG-3′).Data were normalized to actin 2 or ubiquitin (UBQ10) as follows: nCT = CTgene - CTactin or CTubiquitin, where CT refers to the number of cycles at which SYBR green fluorescence (ΔRn) in a PCR reaches an arbitrary value during the exponential phase of DNA amplification, set at 0.3 in all experiments, and then compared according to the formula, Cr (change in signal log ratio) = nCTcontrol - nCsample.Wounding Experiments—Arabidopsis wild-type and transgenic plants harboring the promoter region of the AtDGK2 gene fused to the Escherichia coli GUS reporter gene (18Gómez-Merino F.C. Brearley C.A. Ornatowska M. Abdel-Haliem M.E.F. Zanor M.I. Mueller-Roeber B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8230-8241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) were used to test the effect of wounding on AtDGK2 expression. Wounding of 4-week-old soil-grown plants was performed by thoroughly crushing whole shoots. Wounded and nonwounded plants were harvested at different time points and frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA and protein extraction.Expression of Recombinant AtDGK7 in Bacteria—The coding region of the AtDGK7 cDNA, flanked by XhoI and SpeI sites, was transferred from plasmid pG7 to plasmid pET43c (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany), yielding plasmid pET7. The pET43c vector allows the generation of fusion protein containing a NusA tag and a His6 tag (for detection and purification of target proteins; see Novagen, on the World Wide Web at www.novagen.com). Plasmid pET7 was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) (Novagen). Cells were grown at 37 °C. At an A600 of 0.6, expression of NusA-His-AtDGK7 fusion protein was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mm final concentration). Cells were harvested 4 h later by centrifugation, resuspended in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, and Complete Mini Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Applied Science), and lysed by sonification. Recombinant AtDGK7 was purified using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. All homogenates were frozen and stored at -80 °C until assayed. Protein concentration was determined according to Bradford (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213377) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard.Western Blot Analysis—Purified proteins (20 μg) produced by the pET7 plasmid or the pET43c empty vector were separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar) using a 4% spacer and a 8% (w/v) separating polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences) by semidry electroblotting. For detection, nitrocellulose membranes were blocked overnight in TBS (Tris-buffered saline) containing 0.150 m NaCl, 0.025 m Tris/HCl, pH 7, and 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk (Bio-Rad) prior to a 1-h incubation in anti-His tag antibody (Pierce). After three 15-min washing steps using TBST (TBS plus 0.05% Tween 20 (v/v)) to remove residual antibody, membranes were developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence Western blot detection kit (Pierce SuperSignal) and exposed to x-ray films (Kodak X-OmatAR) for 5 s to 5 min.DGK Enzymatic Assays—Diacylglycerol kinase activity was determined under standard conditions by measuring the incorporation of [γ-32P]ATP into phosphatidic acid at 25 °C as described (18Gómez-Merino F.C. Brearley C.A. Ornatowska M. Abdel-Haliem M.E.F. Zanor M.I. Mueller-Roeber B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8230-8241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To assess Michaelis-Menten kinetics, enzymatic activity of DGK was measured as a function of the sum of molar concentrations of CHAPS, Triton X-100, and DAG at a given mol fraction of DAG. Four stock solutions (A, B, C, and D) were prepared. Stock solution A contained 69.5 mm CHAPS, 30 mm Triton, 0.5 mm DAG (0.005 mm DAG); stock solution B contained 69 mm CHAPS, 30 mm Triton, 1 mm DAG (0.01 mm DAG); stock solution C contained 68 mm CHAPS, 30 mm Triton, 2 mm DAG (0.02 mm DAG); stock solution D contained 65 mm CHAPS, 30 mm Triton, 5 mm DAG (0.05 mm DAG). Stock solutions were prepared as follows: DAG, dissolved in chloroform/methanol (1:1), was placed in 7-ml Schott glass disposable reaction tubes (with screw cap; Schott, Mainz, Germany), dried under a stream of nitrogen vapor, resuspended in a solution of CHAPS and Triton X-100 dissolved in water, and sonified for 5 min in a Sonorex RK 100 sonifier (Bandelin, Berlin, Germany). Increasing volumes (from 3.6 to 35.0 μl) of the stock solution were pipetted into the glass disposable reaction tubes. The final volume of the reaction mix was 250 μl. Diacylglycerol kinase activity was determined by measuring the incorporation of [γ-32P]ATP into PA as described previously (18Gómez-Merino F.C. Brearley C.A. Ornatowska M. Abdel-Haliem M.E.F. Zanor M.I. Mueller-Roeber B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8230-8241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Extraction and separation of phospholipids were performed as follows: 1 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:1) and 500 μl of 1 m KCl plus 0.2 m H3PO4 were added, and the mixture was mixed thoroughly; samples were centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 5 min in a Labofuge 200 centrifuge (Heraeus Sepatech, Osterode, Germany). The lower phase (lipids) was transferred to a new glass reaction tube and washed once with chloroform/methanol and KCl to discard the remaining radiolabeled ATP. The amount of phosphate incorporated was determined by counting the radioactivity in a liquid scintillation counter.Enzymatic activity of AtDGK7 was measured as a function of ATP concentration in mixed micelles. A solution containing 50 mm nonlabeled ATP was prepared as stock. Under standard conditions, each enzymatic reaction contained a final concentration of 1 mm nonlabeled ATP and ∼5 mCi of 32P-labeled ATP (18Gómez-Merino F.C. Brearley C.A. Ornatowska M. Abdel-Haliem M.E.F. Zanor M.I. Mueller-Roeber B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8230-8241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To assess the effect of varying ATP on the enzymatic reaction, four different ATP final concentrations were tested: 0.10, 1.0, 2.0, and 5.0 mm, respectively. The same amount of radioactive ATP (5 mCi) was added to the assays, and the difference in specific radioactivities obtained were taken into account for calculating the enzyme activities in the individual reactions. For this experiment, the sum of the molar concentrations of CHAPS, Triton X-100, and DAG was 7.20 mm (containing 4.90 mm CHAPS, 2.20 mm Triton, and 0.10 mm DAG).The effect of the DGK inhibitor R59022 or 3-{2-{4-[bis-(4-fluorophenyl)methylene]-1-piperidinyl}ethyl}-2,3-dihydro-2-thioxo-4(1H)-quinazolinone (R59949) on Arabidopsis AtDGK2 and AtDGK7 enzymes was tested at different concentrations of DAG and CHAPS as indicated above. The reaction mix was preincubated for 10 min with DGK inhibitor before the reaction was started by the addition of ATP.PA standard was obtained from Sigma (product code P 9511). Hartmann Analytic (Braunschweig, Germany) provided [γ-32P]ATP (15 TBq/mmol). Lipids (1,2-SAG, 1,2-DOG, and cardiolipin), salts (MgCl2, LiCl, and NaCl) and detergents (Na-DC and CHAPS) were purchased from Sigma. Serva (Heidelberg, Germany) provided Triton X-100. DAG molecular species 1,2-POG, 1,2-SLG, and 1,2-OPG were purchased from Larodan Fine Chemicals AB (Malmö, Sweden). DGK inhibitors R59022 and R59949 were purchased from Calbiochem.HPLC Analysis of the Reaction Products of DGK Assay—The products of diacylglycerol kinase assays were obtained by two-phase partitioning. The organic phase was reduced to dryness under a stream of nitrogen gas, and the glycerolipids were deacylated (22Hawkins P.T. Stephens L. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 1986; 238: 507-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). An aliquot of the water-soluble products of deacylation was mixed with l-[U-14C]glycerol 3-phosphate (Amersham Biosciences; specific activity >100 mCi/mmol) and resolved by anion exchange high performance liquid chromatography with a gradient of (NH4)2HPO4 (23Brearley C.A. Hanke D.E. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The column eluate was collected in 1-ml fractions, and 4 ml of Ecoscint A scintillation fluid (National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA) was added. Radioactivity was estimated by dual label scintillation counting in a Wallac 1409 DSA (Turku, Finland) scintillation counter.Effect of R59022 on Plant Growth and Development—A. thaliana (L.) Heynh. seeds (ecotype C24) were surface-sterilized with 70% ethanol for 5 min and sodium hypochlorite solution (5.0% NaClO4 plus 0.05% Tween 20) for 5 min, followed by several washes with sterile water. Subsequently, seeds were sown on MS (Murashige Skoog) plates containing 0.8% agar (square Petri dishes, 100 × 100 × 14 mm; NUNC, Wiesbaden, Germany). The DGK inhibitor R59022 was dissolved in dimethyl formamide. Dimethyl formamide (without R59022) was used as control. The seeds were imbibed at 4 °C in the dark for 1 day. Plates were then placed vertically in a growth chamber under long day conditions (16 h of light, 8 h of dark). Lengths of primary roots from the shoot/root transition zone to the root tip were measured. To analyze the effects of the inhibitor R59022 on plant growth and development, 35-100 μm R59022 was added to MS medium containing 0.8% agar.RESULTSAtDGK7 cDNA and the Deduced Primary Structure of Its Encoded Protein—In the Arabidopsis genome, seven genes encode putative DGK isoforms that fall into three major clusters. AtDGK2, a member of Cluster I, is a catalytically active enzyme. The AtDGK2 gene is located on chromosome V, and its expression is detected in various tissues of the Arabidopsis plant, including leaves and roots, as previously shown (18Gómez-Merino F.C. Brearley C.A. Ornatowska M. Abdel-Haliem M.E.F. Zanor M.I. Mueller-Roeber B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8230-8241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).To investigate whether members of other clusters also encode functional DGKs, we concentrated here on AtDGK7 (encoded by gene locus At4g30340), representing a potential DGK of Cluster II. The AtDGK7 gene is located on chromosome IV, and data base analysis revealed that AtDGK7 is transcribed. In total, four AtDGK7 expressed sequence tags (ESTs; GenBank™ accession numbers AV798976, AV827682, CF773882, and Z26229) and two cDNA sequences (AF360174 and AY113915) obtained through the full-length cDNA cloning projects at RIKEN and SALK can be retrieved from the NCBI data base (available on the World Wide Web at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Because of previous data base annotation ambiguities (reported in Ref. 18Gómez-Merino F.C. Brearley C.A. Ornatowska M. Abdel-Haliem M.E.F. Zanor M.I. Mueller-Roeber B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8230-8241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), we reanalyzed the AtDGK7 sequence in detail here (see Fig. 1A). RIKEN ESTs AV827682 and AV798976 were both derived from clone RAFL 09-18-D16 and represent the 5′ and 3′ regions, respectively, of the AF360174 sequence, which in total encompasses 1807 base pairs. The EST Z26229 sequence was obtained from the Versailles EST collection and, like EST AV798976, corresponds to the 3′ part of the AF360174 full-length cDNA. The EST CF773882 covers the central part of the transcript. Finally, cDNA AY113915, generated at SALK, has a length of 1156 base pairs. The available data can be summarized as follows. (i) The AF360174 and AY113915 cDNAs code for the same protein, AtDGK7, which has a deduced length of 374 amino acids, a predicted molecular mass of 41.2 kDa, and an isoelectric point of 7.73. This prediction fully corresponds to the most recent TIGR annotation (version 5.0) for AtDGK7 (available on the World Wide Web at www.tigr.org). (ii) The AF360174 cDNA contains a 5′-untranslated region at positions 1-126, the AtDGK7 open reading frame at positions 127-1251, and an unusually long 3′-untranslated region at positions 1252-1807. The presence of this long untranslated region in the AtDGK7 transcript was confirmed by the independently generated EST Z26229. The generation of the long transcript is further in full accordance with data from recent Arabidopsis MPSS analyses (24Meyers B.C. Lee D.K. Vu T.H. Tej S.S. Edberg S.B. Matvienko M. Tindell L.D.

A 17-bp MPSS signature sequence corresponding to the very 3′-end of the AtDGK7 gene was found (GATCTATGTTGAGCTTT on the Crick DNA strand). (iii) The nucleotide sequences of the two cDNAs are completely identical in the overlapping region (which encompassed the complete AtDGK7 open reading frame and part of the 3′-untranslated region).Protein sequence analysis reveals that AtDGK7 has a conserved catalytic domain (DGKc; Pfam accession number PF00781) (Fig. 1, B and C), located at amino acid residues 94-240, which contains a presumed ATP-binding site with a GXGXXG consensus sequence. Although the DGKc of AtDGK7 is ∼40% identical to that of AtDGK2, the DGK accessory domain (DGKa; Pfam accession number PF00609) is incomplete in AtDGK7 (Fig. 1B). In most AtDGK isoforms, the DGKa domain encompasses ∼160 amino acid residues, but in AtDGK7, it includes only 52 residues (Asn290-Asn341). Furthermore, AtDGK7, like all other Cluster II and also Cluster III enzymes, lacks the N-terminal diacylglycerol/phorbol ester-binding domains (InterPro accession number IPR002219) as well as the upstream basic region and the extended cysteine-rich domain (extCRD-like domain) present in AtDGK2 (18Gómez-Merino F.C.

https://openalex.org/W2058338619,"Transcription of eukaryotic genes is performed by three nuclear RNA polymerases, of which RNA polymerase II is thought to be solely responsible for the synthesis of messenger RNAs1. Here we show that transcription of some mRNAs in humans and rodents is mediated by a previously unknown single-polypeptide nuclear RNA polymerase (spRNAP-IV). spRNAP-IV is expressed from an alternative transcript of the mitochondrial RNA polymerase gene (POLRMT). The spRNAP-IV lacks 262 amino-terminal amino acids of mitochondrial RNA polymerase, including the mitochondrial-targeting signal, and localizes to the nucleus. Transcription by spRNAP-IV is resistant to the RNA polymease II inhibitor α-amanitin but is sensitive to short interfering RNA specific for the POLRMT gene. The promoters for spRNAP-IV differ substantially from those used by RNA polymerase II, do not respond to transcriptional enhancers and contain a common functional sequence motif."
https://openalex.org/W1575992003,"Geoscientists are usually known for their studies of rocks and minerals and the distributions of these on Earth, but this group of scientists has been expanding its discipline into surprising new territory by linking geology with human and animal health. Known as medical geology, this emerging specialty is gaining momentum. Chandra Dissanayake, professor of geology at the University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka, outlines some of the major areas of medical geology in both his homeland and beyond, covering topics such as the link between naturally occurring fluoride in drinking water and a disfiguring tooth condition; global health risks due to iodine deficiency; the widespread practice of eating dirt; the potential for hard water to serve protective roles against cardiovascular disease; and the apparent paradox that people living in regions marked by high levels of natural radioactivity do not seem to suffer adverse health effects from their exposure. Because people must interact with their geological surroundings, discoveries made by medical geologists can have enormous consequences for the well-being of people all over the world.

https://openalex.org/W2077069036,"Signal regulatory proteins (SIRPs) comprise a family of cell surface signaling receptors differentially expressed in leukocytes and the central nervous system. Although the extracellular domains of SIRPs are highly similar, classical motifs in the cytoplasmic or transmembrane domains distinguish them as either activating (β) or inhibitory (α) isoforms. We reported previously that human neutrophils (polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN)) express multiple SIRP isoforms and that SIRPα binding to its ligand CD47 regulates PMN transmigration. Here we further characterized the expression of PMN SIRPs, and we reported that the major SIRPα and SIRPβ isoforms expressed in PMN include Bit/PTPNS-1 and SIRPβ1, respectively. Furthermore, although SIRPα (Bit/PTPNS-1) is expressed as a monomer, we showed that SIRPβ1 is expressed on the cell surface as a disulfide-linked homodimer with bond formation mediated by Cys-320 in the membrane-proximal Ig loop. Subcellular fractionation studies revealed a major pool of SIRPβ1 within the plasma membrane fractions of PMN. In contrast, the majority of SIRPα (Bit/PTPNS-1) is present in fractions enriched in secondary granules and is translocated to the cell surface after chemoattractant (formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine) stimulation. Functional studies revealed that antibody-mediated ligation of SIRPβ1 enhanced formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine-driven PMN transepithelial migration. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments to identify associated adaptor proteins revealed a 10–12-kDa protein associated with SIRPβ1 that was tyrosine-phosphorylated after PMN stimulation and is not DAP10/12 or Fc receptor γ chain. These results provide new insights into the structure and function of SIRPs in leukocytes and their potential role(s) in fine-tuning responses to inflammatory stimuli.

SIRPs can be divided into two subfamilies, SIRPα and SIRPβ, based on the putative structures of their C-terminal intracellular domains (11Kharitonenkov A. Chen Z. Sures I. Wang H. Schilling J. Ullrich A. Nature. 1997; 386: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). SIRPs share typical immunoglobulin superfamily structures with an N-terminal extracellular domain containing three cysteine-bound Ig-like loops, a single membrane-spanning transmembrane domain, and a C-terminal intracellular domain (11Kharitonenkov A. Chen Z. Sures I. Wang H. Schilling J. Ullrich A. Nature. 1997; 386: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). The C-terminal intracellular domains of the SIRPα subfamily contain a relatively long amino acid sequence (110 amino acids for SIRPα1) that includes four tyrosine residues to form two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs (ITIM). Conversely, SIRPβ subfamily members have a short intracellular domain containing only a few amino acids (4 amino acids for SIRPβ1). Despite a short cytoplasmic tail, SIRPβ1 contains a positively charged lysine in the transmembrane domain that can mediate interactions with an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM), containing adaptor protein. This type of protein structure and adaptor protein interaction has been shown for other immunoreceptors such as NK cell receptors and Fc receptors (12Chiesa S. Tomasello E. Vivier E. Vely F. Mol. Immunol. 2005; 42: 477-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 13Lanier L.L. Nat. Immun. 2001; 2: 23-27Crossref Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 14Lanier L.L. Curr. Opin.

Immunol. 1997; 158: 5083-5086PubMed Google Scholar)), DAP10, and Fc receptor γ chain (FcRγ), interact with the parent receptor through ionic interactions within the transmembrane domain to mediate outside-in signaling (16Lanier L.L. Corliss B. Wu J. Phillips J.H. Immunity. 1998; 8: 693-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). However, not all SIRPβ family members share this type of protein structure. SIRPβ2 (also termed SIRPγ (1Brooke G. Holbrook J.D. Brown M.H. Barclay A.N. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 2562-2570Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar)) lacks an apparent adaptor-binding element in its transmembrane domain. These different structures of SIRP family members and their associated distinctive signaling elements suggest potential divergent roles of SIRP isoforms in regulating cellular functions. signal regulatory protein polymorphonuclear leukocytes peripheral blood mononuclear cells junctional adhesion molecule Hanks' balanced salt solution Hanks' balanced salt solution devoid of Ca2+ and Mg2+ monoclonal antibody reverse transcription formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif Fc receptor γ; chain In a previous study (17Liu Y.

Chem. 2002; 277: 10028-10036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), we reported evidence of several SIRP proteins that are expressed in human PMN. In addition, we demonstrated that SIRPα regulates PMN transmigration across epithelial monolayers through interaction with another Ig superfamily cell surface protein CD47. However, given the highly homologous extracellular domain structures of SIRP family members, it was difficult to rigorously define the identities and functional roles of other SIRP proteins in PMN. In the present study, we utilized SIRPα and -β isoform-specific antibodies and RT-PCR to identify the major isoforms of SIRPα and -β in human PMN. From these studies, we discovered important structural differences between SIRPα and -β. In particular, we report for the first time that SIRPβ1 is expressed not as a monomer but as a disulfide-linked homodimer. Furthermore, our results suggest that, in contrast to SIRPα, antibody-mediated ligation of SIRPβ1 enhances PMN transmigration.

A murine polyclonal antibody specific to SIRPα was generated by immunizing mice with a fusion protein consisting of the extracellular domain of human SIRPα1 (Ig loops 1 + 2 + 3) fused to rabbit Fc (SIRPα1.ex-Fc) (18Liu Y. O'Connor M.B. Mandell K.J. Zen K. Ullrich A. Buhring H.J. Parkos C.A. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 2578-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies B4B6 and B1D5 that specifically bind to SIRPβ were generated as described previously (19Seiffert M. Brossart P. Cant C. Cella M. Colonna M. Brugger W. Kanz L. Ullrich A.

In addition, we produced murine polyclonal anti-DAP12 and DAP10 antibodies by immunizing BALB/c mice with a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing the putative intracellular domain of DAP12 and DAP10. Rabbit polyclonal antibody against FcRγ was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. As a noninhibitory antibody binding control for PMN transmigration assays, we used anti-JAM-A mAb J10.4 (22Liu Y. Nusrat A. Schnell F.J. Reaves T.A. Walsh S. Pochet M. Parkos C.A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2363-2374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As an inhibitory control for PMN transmigration assays, we used anti-CD47 mAb C5D5 as described previously (23Liu Y. Merlin D. Burst S.L. Pochet M. Madara J.L. Parkos C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40156-40166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). PMN, Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC), and HL60 Cells—To isolate PMN and PBMC, fresh blood from healthy donors and anticoagulated with 0.38% sodium citrate was centrifuged for 10 min (1000 rpm) at room temperature, and the upper layer of platelet-rich plasma was removed. The lower layer of cells was subjected to dextran (Amersham Biosciences) sedimentation to separate leukocytes from red blood cells. The leukocyte-containing fraction was further separated by Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Biosciences) sedimentation followed by separate collection of PMN- and PBMC-enriched fractions. After washing with cold HBSS(–), leukocytes were resuspended in HBSS(–) and used within 4 h. PMN prepared in this way typically represented >90–95% of cells in such isolates. HL60 cells were obtained from American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC) and maintained in RPMI medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum. Epithelial Cells—T84 cells (passages 59–76) were grown in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 6% fetal bovine serum. For transmigration experiments, T84 cells were grown on collagen-coated, permeable polycarbonate filters (5-μm pore size) with a surface area of 0.33 cm2 (Costar, Cambridge, MA) as described previously (24Parkos C.A. Colgan S.P. Liang T.W. Nusrat A. Bacarra A.E. Carnes D.K. Madara J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 437-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting Experiments—Cells were lysed with buffer containing 100 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100 or octyl glucoside, 1:100 dilution of proteinase inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell lysates (200–400 μg of total protein) were pre-cleared with 2–5 μg of control IgG-conjugated Sepharose before incubation with 1–2 μg of specific mAb and protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) for 4 h (4 °C). Washed immunoprecipitates were boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer with (reducing condition) or without β-mercaptoethanol (nonreducing condition) and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to nitrocellulose under standard conditions. Nonspecific binding was blocked by 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST (2 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20 (pH 7.4)) followed by immunoblotting with the specific antibody. To detect SIRPβ1 in leukocytes, immunoprecipitation was performed using mAb B4B6 or B1D5 followed by immunoblotting with the same mAb or with rabbit anti-SIRPα1.ex. To confirm SIRPβ1 existing as a disulfide-bonded dimer, total cell lysates or SIRPβ1 immunoprecipitates were treated with 30–300 mm iodoacetamide for 30 min at 25 °C before SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions and Western blot. To biotinylate SIRPβ1 in PMN, freshly isolated PMN (107) were incubated with N-hydroxysuccinimide-biotin (Pierce) at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml in HBSS for 1 h on ice. Cells were then washed three times with HBSS followed by quenching with 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5) and 100 mm NH4Cl for 1 h before cell lysis. After immunoprecipitation of SIRPβ1, Western blots of biotin-labeled proteins were probed with streptavidin-peroxidase followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). SIRPα protein was immunoprecipitated with a murine polyclonal anti-SIRPα antibody. In a subset of experiments, SIRPα was co-precipitated using CD47-AP fusion protein as described below. To chemically cross-link proteins in PMN, unstimulated and fMLP-stimulated PMN (2 × 107) were incubated with 1 mm dithiobis[succinimidylpropionate] or dithiobis[sulfosuccinimidylpropionate] (Pierce) in HBSS for 1 h. The reaction was terminated by washing and quenching with 0.2 m Tris (pH 7.5) and 0.1 m NH4Cl for 30 min. SIRPβ1, DAP12, and CD11b were detected by immunoblotting of the cell lysates using mAb B4B6, mouse anti-DAP12 antibody, and rabbit anti-CD11b antibody R7928A (23Liu Y. Merlin D. Burst S.L. Pochet M. Madara J.L. Parkos C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40156-40166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). SIRPα Co-precipitation Experiments—A recombinant fusion protein consisting of the putative extracellular domain of CD47 and alkaline phosphatase (CD47-AP) was generated as described previously (17Liu Y. Buhring H.J. Zen K. Burst S.L. Schnell F.J. Williams I.R. Parkos C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10028-10036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). A fusion protein containing the extracellular domain of human JAM-A (JAM-AP) was used as a control. Both CD47-AP and JAM-AP (2 μgof each) were incubated with PMN cell lysates for 2 h at 4 °C followed by further incubation with 20 μl of anti-AP conjugated agarose (Sigma) for 2 h. The agarose bead-protein complexes were washed three times followed by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions and blot with antibodies against SIRPα and SIRPβ. RT-PCR Amplification of SIRPα and -β Subfamily Isoforms from Leu-kocytes—Total RNA was isolated from freshly isolated PBMC (5 × 108) and PMN (2 × 108). Because PMN have much less RNA than PBMC and, from our experience, in vitro isolated PMN generally contain 5–10% PBMC contamination., we collected PMN after 2 h of migration across collagen-coated filters toward fMLP to greatly enrich preparations in PMN and avoid contamination with PBMC. We found that the vast majority of cells that migrated across in 2 h are PMN (>99.5%) and thus used these cells to isolate RNA. To amplify SIRPα isoforms, RT-PCR was performed, and multiple sense and antisense primers were used as follows: SP1 (5′-ccgcggcccatggagcccgcc); SP2 (5′-tagtgttctcagcggcggcggtatt); SP3 (5′-ggtgacattcacctggttctc); SP4 (5′-ggtgaagctcacactgtgtgctg); SP5 (5′-gcgtcctgcgcctggtcagga); SP6 (5′-agtgttctcagcggcggtatt); SP8 (5′-cagcacacagtgagcttcacc); SP9 (5′-gaggtggcccacgtcacctt); bcsirp (5′-cctgatggcggccctc); xcsirp (5′-gagtcccattcacttcct); CS1 (5′-ctggcgtactctgagaaggacgg); CS2 (5′-ctgcttgggggtccggttgag); NSP3 (gacaagtccgtatcagttgca); NSP4 (ggagagtcggccattctgcac); Bit139F (5′-cagcctgacaagtccgtgttg); Bit 421R (5′-tgctccagacttaaactccac); SIRPα114F (5′-cagcctgacaagtccgtatca); and SIRPα406R (5′-tgctccagacttaaactccgt). To amplify SIRPβ isoforms, primers used included the following: SbN1 (5′-cgccaccatgcccgtgccagcctcc); SbN2 (5′-atctcaagatctagcagtaggagccagcgc); SPB1 (5′-atgcccgtgccagcctcctgg); SPB2 (5′-ttcctgctgatgacgctactg); SPB2 (1)N(5′-cgccaccatgattcagcctgagaag); SPB2 (2)N (5′-ctccaaaatgcctgtcccagcctcctgg); SbC1 (5′-atatctcgagcagtcaggccttctgtttccagc); SPB2 (2)C (5′-aagagatgatgccgggcc); and SPB5 (5′-gacaccaaccaccagtagcagctt). PCRs were also performed using a human leukocyte cDNA library (BD Biosciences, marathon-ready cDNA) as the template, and amplified DNA fragments were sequenced. Site-directed Mutagenesis of Cysteine Residues in SIRPβ1—Full-length, wild-type SIRPβ1 was cloned into pCDNA3.1 and used as a template for mutagenesis. Cys-320 was mutated to serine and alanine using forward primers 5′-agctggctcctggtgaacacctctgcccacagg and 5′-agctggctcctggtgaacaccgctgcccacagg, respectively. The reverse primer for constructing both C320S and C320A was 5′-aggtgttcaccaggagccagctcatccagt. Cys-393 was mutated to valine using forward primer 5′-ggtgtctctgccatctacatcgtctggaaacag and reverse primer 5′-gatgtagatggcagagacaccaaccaccag. Mutations of Cys-320 and Cys-393 were performed using the GeneTailor site-directed mutagenesis system (Invitrogen). After confirmation by DNA sequencing, at least two clones of each mutant were selected and transiently transfected into COS-7 cells using the DEAE-dextran method. COS cells were then lysed 48–72 h after transfection, and SIRPβ1 expression was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. In addition, expression of SIRPβ1 was also assessed by immunofluorescence staining and flow cytometry analysis (fluorescence-activated cell sorter). Subcellular Fractionation Experiments—Stimulation of PMN was performed in Petri dishes using 1 μm fMLP in HBSS and incubation at 37 °C (30 min). Unstimulated and stimulated PMN (2 × 108 cells per condition) were then resuspended in 5 ml of cavitation buffer (0.34 m sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na2ATP (pH 7.4)) and disrupted by nitrogen cavitation (15 min, 400 p.s.i., 4 °C). The lysates were centrifuged at low speed (1000 rpm), and the supernatants were subjected to isopycnic sucrose density gradient fractionation on linear 20–55% sucrose gradients in a Beckman SW-28 swinging bucket rotor (100,000 × g, 3 h, 4 °C) as described previously (23Liu Y.

From each gradient, 1.5-ml fractions were collected and were analyzed for sucrose density and protein. The subcellular localization of plasma membrane and primary and secondary granules was determined by assays of alkaline phosphatase, myeloperoxidase, and lactoferrin, respectively, as described previously (23Liu Y.

PMN Transepithelial Migration Assay—PMN transepithelial migration in the physiologically relevant basolateral to apical direction was performed using isolated PMN and intestinal epithelial monolayers exactly as described previously (23Liu Y.

Briefly, confluent inverted T84 monolayers were washed twice with HBSS (20 °C), and PMN (106) in 150 μl of HBSS with or without antibody were added to the upper chamber of the monolayer setup. Transmigration was initiated by adding 1 ml of 1 μm fMLP (in HBSS) to the lower chamber followed by incubation at 37 °C. PMN migration across epithelial monolayers into the fMLP-containing lower chambers was quantified by myeloperoxidase assay (23Liu Y. Merlin D. Burst S.L. Pochet M. Madara J.L. Parkos C.A. J. Biol.

Identification of SIRP Proteins in Leukocytes—In previous experiments, we used a polyclonal rabbit antibody against the SIRPα1 extracellular domain, anti-SIRPα1.ex (11Kharitonenkov A. Chen Z. Sures I. Wang H. Schilling J. Ullrich A. Nature. 1997; 386: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar), to study SIRPα expression in PMN (17Liu Y. Buhring H.J. Zen K. Burst S.L. Schnell F.J. Williams I.R. Parkos C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10028-10036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). We observed that this antibody labels multiple protein bands in Western blots from detergent-solubilized PMN (17Liu Y. Buhring H.J. Zen K. Burst S.L. Schnell F.J. Williams I.R. Parkos C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10028-10036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, immunoblots of PMN using anti-SIRPα1.ex revealed broad bands with molecular mass values of 110–120, 65–75, and/or 52–58 kDa (Fig. 1A, arrows) after nonreduced SDS-PAGE. Similar immunoblotting patterns of SIRP proteins were also obtained from detergent-solubilized PBMC and PMN-like Me2SO-induced HL60 cells by anti-SIRPα1.ex under nonreducing conditions. Because of the high degree of homology between the extracellular domains of SIRP family isoforms, we hypothesized that anti-SIRPα1.ex is likely cross-reactive with several SIRP isoforms. To better characterize the isoforms of SIRPs expressed in PMN and to study their functional roles PMN, we performed experiments using SIRPβ isoform-specific antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies B4B6 and B1D5 were generated against the SIRPβ1 extracellular domain (19Seiffert M. Brossart P. Cant C. Cella M. Colonna M. Brugger W. Kanz L. Ullrich A. Buhring H.J. Blood. 2001; 97: 2741-2749Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and binding was confirmed to be noncross-reactive with SIRPα by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (data not shown) and cell binding assays (19Seiffert M. Brossart P. Cant C. Cella M. Colonna M. Brugger W. Kanz L. Ullrich A. Buhring H.J. Blood. 2001; 97: 2741-2749Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). These specific mAbs were used to immunoprecipitate and/or immunoblot SIRPβ from detergent-solubilized PMN and other leukocytes. As shown in Fig. 1B, under nonreducing conditions, mAbs B4B6 and B1D5 exclusively immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted a protein band of 110–120 kDa, which correlates with the highest molecular weight SIRP protein species shown in Fig. 1A. These results were surprising given that SIRPβ has a predicted core molecular mass of ∼45 kDa (398 amino acids for SIRPβ1). Because these results were obtained after nonreducing SDS-PAGE, we hypothesized that SIRPβ protein may exist as a disulfide-linked homodimer or hetero-oligomer. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 1C, after reducing SDS-PAGE, the anti-SIRPβ1 mAb-reactive band decreased to 55 kDa. To exclude hetero-oligomerization of SIRPβ with other protein(s) through disulfide bonding, PMN were biotinylated with cell-permeable N-hydroxysuccinimide-biotin followed by immunoprecipitation and nonreduced SDS-PAGE. In these experiments, we excised the 110–120-kDa SIRPβ protein band from the nonreduced acrylamide gels and performed a second electrophoresis under reducing conditions. Western blots of the second running were then performed using peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin. No protein band other than the characteristic 55-kDa SIRPβ protein band was detected (results not shown). Finally, to rule out the possibility that the dimerization observed is a gel artifact due to oxidation of unpaired cysteine residues during electrophoresis, we confirmed that iodoacetamide treatment of PMN had no effect on the electrophoretic mobility of SIRPβ (data not shown). These results thus support the notion that SIRPβ likely exists as disulfide-bonded homodimer in leukocytes. To identify SIRPα in PMN, we generated SIRPα-specific antibodies using fusion proteins containing either SIRPα1 extracellular domain (SIRPα1.ex-Fc) or SIRPα1 intracellular domain (SIRPα1.ct-GST). As shown in Fig. 1D, under nonreducing and reducing conditions, the SIRPα1 antibodies label a protein band of 65–75 kDa from detergent-solubilized PMN and other leukocytes, which corresponds to the middle protein band (arrow) in Fig. 1A, and had no cross-reactivity with the 110–120-kDa SIRPβ band (Fig. 1B). In addition, we also performed immunodepletion experiments using anti-SIRPβ mAb B4B6, and the results confirmed these findings (data not shown). To confirm further that this 65–75-kDa protein is indeed SIRPα, we performed co-precipitation assays with a SIRPα-binding CD47 extracellular domain fusion protein (CD47-AP), which was previously confirmed to bind specifically to SIRPα but not to SIRPβ1 (17Liu Y.

As shown in Fig. 1E, compared with the control, co-precipitation using another abundantly expressed PMN immunoglobulin superfamily member JAM-A (JAM-AP) (17Liu Y. Buhring H.J. Zen K. Burst S.L. Schnell F.J. Williams I.R. Parkos C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10028-10036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), CD47-AP specifically precipitated a protein of 65–75 kDa that was labeled by anti-SIRPα. This result is consistent with the immunoblotting results (Fig. 1D) and suggest that the protein of 65–75 kDa is SIRPα. In contrast to SIRPβ, the apparent molecular mass of SIRPα is not significantly decreased after reduction and remains at 65–75 kDa (Fig. 1D), indicating that SIRPα most likely exists as a monomer with a molecular mass of 65–75 kDa in human leukocytes. The Predominant SIRPα and β Subfamily Isoforms in PMN Are Bit/PTPNS-1 and SIRPβ1—Because previous studies suggest that there are multiple isoforms of SIRPα (SIRPα1 and -α2, Bit (25Ohnishi H.

Total RNA samples were isolated from transmigrated PMN (see “Materials and Methods”) to minimize contamination of other leukocytes.

These libraries contain considerable shape diversity as evident by the successful isolation of aptamers that bind with high affinity and specificity to chemically diverse targets. We propose that aptamer libraries contain sufficient shape diversity to allow deconvolution of a complex mixture of targets. Using unfractionated human plasma as our experimental model, we aim to develop methods to obtain aptamers against as many proteins as possible. To begin, it is critical that we understand how aptamer populations change with increasing rounds of in vitro selection when using complex mixtures. Our results show that sequence representation in the selected population changes dramatically with increasing rounds of selection. Certain aptamer families were apparent after only three selection rounds. Two additional cycles saw a decline in the relative abundance of these families and the emergence of yet another family that accounted for more than 60% of sequences in the pool. To overcome this population convergence, an aptamer-based target depletion method was developed, and the library screen was repeated. The previous dominant family effectively disappeared from the selected populations but was replaced by other aptamer families.

It is becoming increasingly apparent that our understanding of the complexity of many biological processes is limited by studies that focus on just a few molecules. This realization is largely due to the recent development of technologies that allow simultaneous measurement of thousands of different molecules. Information obtained from this type of assay not only puts a scale (number of genes or proteins) to the system under study but allows more accurate classification of biological states. Clearly, more detailed insights into a biological system or process can be gained if the number and identity of components is known (1Baliga N.S. Pan M. Goo Y.A. Yi E.C. Goodlett D.R. Dimitrov K.

In particular the assignment of genotypic and phenotypic signatures to various biological states is not only useful diagnostically but has also increased our understanding of disease progression (7Sperger J.M.

The task overall is the same: identify all of the components of the system and develop ways to measure their concentration. The technical challenge, however, is considerably more difficult because of the enormous shape diversity present in the proteome (10Kodadek T. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 105-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). This multiplicity of shapes is increased further when consideration is given to how the immediate chemical environment can modify three-dimensional structure, for example, whether the protein is part of a complex or subject to some form of activation. Current approaches to defining the composition of complex mixtures of proteins commonly involve state-of-the-art mass spectrometry coupled with some form of chromatography. Quantitation of individual proteins is largely being addressed using mass spectrometry or by shape recognition via antibodies (11Liotta L.A. Espina V. Mehta A.I. Calvert V. Rosenblatt K. Geho D. Munson P.J. Young L. Wulfkuhle J. Petricoin III, E.F. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 317-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). These approaches are limiting either because they are expensive and require a high level of technical expertise or because deriving the required antibodies is slow.Various attempts have been made to use random shape libraries and in vitro selection methods to study complex biological targets. In certain cases this approach has led to the identification of functional agonists or antagonists (12Wang J. Jiang H. Liu F. RNA. 2000; 6: 571-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 13Ulrich H. Magdesian M.H. Alves M.J. Colli W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20756-20762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), whereas in others it has provided a method to gain insight into the molecular complexity of the biological target (14Morris K.N.

Typically the library is subjected to some form of affinity partitioning against a target molecule, and the small amount of bound material is recovered and amplified. Specific target-binding species are enriched by repeating cycles of in vitro selection until a predetermined end point is reached. In a majority of cases the selection is stopped when sequence analysis shows that the selected pool contains multiple representations of a particular motif. Typically this motif will bind to a single target within the complex mixture (18Ringquist S. Jones T. Snyder E.E. Gibson T. Boni I. Gold L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3640-3648Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 19Pan W. Craven R.C. Qiu Q. Wilson C.B. Wills J.W. Golovine S. Wang J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Used in this way, in vitro selection simply produces the equivalent of an antibody with the advantage that all manipulations occur in vitro, and the desired reagent is obtained in a shorter period of time.Rather than focus on just one or a few targets in a complex biological mixture, there is no reason why most if not all proteins could be identified using random sequence libraries. This would, however, require a library screening strategy that balances a requirement for obtaining shapes that exhibit high affinity binding against the observed narrowing of the population toward a single target with increasing rounds of in vitro selection. To achieve this balance it is necessary to understand how certain experimental variables influence the composition and target binding affinity of in vitro selected populations and how those populations change with increasing rounds of selection.Arguably one of the most important variables that determines the success of an in vitro selection experiment is the fraction of shape space present in a library (Ref. 23Carothers J.M. Oestreich S.C. Davis J.H. Szostak J.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 5130-5137Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar and references therein). Although rough approximations can be made for the amount of sequence diversity in a library, current knowledge does not allow reliable estimates of the corresponding shape diversity. The influence of a number of other variables has been modeled both experimentally (49Mutuberria R. Hoogenboom H.R. van der Linden E. de Bruine A.P. Roovers R.C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 231: 65-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and mathematically both for single targets and mixtures of targets (24Irvine D. Tuerk C. Gold L. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 739-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 25Mandecki W. Chen Y.C. Grihalde N. J. Theor. Biol. 1995; 176: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 26Vant-Hull B. Payano-Baez A. Davis R.H. Gold L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 579-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In practice, enrichment for high affinity binders has usually involved a progressive decrease in target concentration or extended washing prior to elution of the bound population from the target. The diversity of selected pools has been followed either by sequencing or some form of fingerprinting technique but only in the context of deciding when to terminate the screen rather than to understand in vitro selection dynamics. Much still needs to be done to more thoroughly understand the in vitro selection process, particularly when applied to complex mixtures.It is well known that single-stranded nucleic acids adopt unique sequence-dependent three-dimensional shapes (27Batey R.T. Rambo R.P. Doudna J.A. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1999; 38: 2326-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 28Soukup J.K. Soukup G.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2004; 14: 344-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This property has been exploited to create shape libraries that have yielded ligands that bind with high affinity and specificity to a variety of molecules across a broad range of size and chemical composition (29Osborne S.E. Ellington A.D. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 349-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 30Wilson D.S. Szostak J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 611-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). A number of novel diagnostics and therapeutics have been isolated from these aptamer libraries, further indicating the significant amount of shape diversity they possess (31Nimjee S.M. Rusconi C.P. Sullenger B.A. Annu. Rev. Med. 2005; 56: 555-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar, 32Farokhzad O.C. Jon S. Khademhosseini A. Tran T.N. Lavan D.A. Langer R.

Biol. 1997; 4: 809-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). We have initiated studies to establish whether there is enough shape diversity in a nucleic acid aptamer library to allow recognition of each component of a complex biological mixture. Human plasma was chosen as a model complex mixture because it contains a large number of proteins present at concentrations that span 6 orders of magnitude and because its composition can easily be changed by chromatography (37Anderson N.L. Anderson N.G. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2002; 1: 845-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3506) Google Scholar). The latter property is important because the high concentration of albumin has plagued other efforts to define the plasma proteome, and we needed to be able to remove it if required (38Tirumalai R.S.

Huang S.T. Anderson N.L. Steiner S. Proteomics. 2003; 3: 422-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Using a straightforward in vitro selection protocol, we isolated aptamers that bound to several different plasma proteins. We followed the relative abundance of aptamer families with increasing rounds of in vitro selection to develop an understanding of the selection process particularly in terms of the number of targets identified. Insights gained from these initial results led to the design of a modified library screening protocol that yielded a different selected population profile and dynamic. Binding affinities were determined at different stages of the selection process for several aptamers that bound to prothrombin. High affinity aptamers were present in the population after only four cycles of selection.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESOligonucleotide Library and Reagents—DNA oligonucleotide template library 5′-AGCTCAGAATAAACGCTCAA-N45-TTCGACATGAGGCCGGATC-3′, unmodified and modified (5′-biotin or 5′-phosphate) primers (forward, 5′-GGGAGCTCAGAATAAACGCTCAA-3′; reverse, 5′-GATCCGGCCTCATGTCGAA-3′) were produced by solid phase chemical synthesis (MWG Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany). Because of variability in the quality of oligonucleotide synthesis, full-length product was purified on 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. DNA was recovered from gels by electroelution and ethanol-precipitated. This single-stranded material was made double-stranded by a standard fill-in reaction using T7 DNA polymerase, and library complexity was estimated from the yield of double-stranded DNA (40Conrad R.C. Giver L. Tian Y. Ellington A.D. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 267: 336-367Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Larger amounts of this pool of double-stranded DNA were created by polymerase chain reaction. Typically, 2 × 1014 double-stranded DNA molecules were amplified in a 34.8-ml reaction (for a 0.1-ml reaction: 20 pm forward and reverse primers, 200 μm dNTPs, 0.5 unit Taq polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA)). A total of five cycles (94 °C 30 s, 58 °C 10 s, and 72 °C 30 s) were performed. Unless otherwise specified, all reagents were obtained from Sigma.Coupling Plasma Proteins to CH-Sepharose—Human blood was obtained by venipuncture into vacuette tubes containing 5 mm EDTA (Greiner Bio-One, Frickenhausen, Germany). Platelet poor plasma was isolated by centrifugation at 2500 × g for 15 min and then dialyzed (Spectra/Por MWCO 3500; Spectrum Laboratories Inc., CA) against 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8 mm Na2HPO4, 1.15 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4 (1× BB). The plasma proteins were coupled to CH-Sepharose 4B according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). The quantity of protein covalently bound to Sepharose was determined using a bicinchoninic acid binding assay (Pierce). Typically 70% of plasma proteins were coupled at a density of 17.5 μg protein/mg of Sepharose.In Vitro Selection Protocol—Library screens were initiated using 4.5 μg of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) 3The abbreviation used is: ssDNA, single-stranded DNA. including 20 fmol of 5′-32P-labeled ssDNA (5 × 103 CPM/fmol ssDNA) as tracer. Single-stranded DNA in 1× BB (1 μm) was heat-denatured for 10 min at 68 °C and cooled to room temperature. To remove matrix-binding aptamers the library was incubated for 90 min with 20 mg of CH-Sepharose that had been blocked with Tris-HCl. Unbound ssDNA was partitioned from the Sepharose by spin filtration (1000 × g for 30 s) with a SPIN-X spin filter (Corning Costar, Acton, MA). Recovered ssDNA was then incubated with 20 mg of plasma-coupled Sepharose for 90 min at room temperature. Unbound ssDNA was again removed by spin filtration, and the beads were washed five times with 0.5 ml of 1× BB. Bound ssDNA was recovered by incubating beads in 7 m urea, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8, at 80 °C for 5 min followed by ethanol precipitation. Recovered ssDNA was amplified (94 °C 30 s, 58 °C 10 s, and 72 °C 30 s) with forward and phosphorylated reverse primers using Taq polymerase (New England Biolabs). Excess primer was digested with exonuclease I (2 units/ml), and then ssDNA was generated using λ exonuclease (12.5 units/ml) (New England Biolabs). For subsequent cycles the amount of aptamer pool used for selections was reduced 5-fold.Cloning and DNA Sequence Analysis—Amplified double-stranded DNA from selected pools was cloned into pGEM T-Easy (Promega) and sequenced using a Beckman CEQ™ 8000 automated DNA sequencer (Beckman Coulter, Fullarton, CA). For alignments, a software program written in Python (www.python.org/) and running the SPLASH pattern recognition algorithm (41Califano A. Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 341-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) was used (Biolateral, Sydney, Australia). Sequences that conformed to a minimum pattern length of 8 bases with a minimum of 6 non-wild card bases in the pattern were obtained.Protein Purification and Identification—Single-stranded DNA for individual aptamers was generated by PCR using a 5′-biotinylated forward primer. Biotinylated ssDNA (10 pmol) was thermally folded and incubated with 25 μl of dialyzed plasma in a final volume of 100 μl for 90 min at room temperature. Aptamer-protein complexes were then captured on streptavidin-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The complexes were washed four times with 0.5 ml of 1× BB containing 0.05% Tween 20. The beads were resuspended in Laemmli loading buffer and heated at 90 °C for 3 min, and eluates were electrophoresed on 6% SDS-PAGE gels. The proteins were visualized by silver staining (42Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7768) Google Scholar).Matrix-assisted laser adsorption ionization mass spectroscopy of aptamer bead-bound protein and peptide mass fingerprinting analysis was performed by the Australian Proteomics Facility (Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia).Surface Plasmon Resonance Measurements—Biomolecular interaction analysis was performed using a Biacore 2000 biosensor (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden). Sensor chips (CM5 research grade) and reagents for covalent coupling were purchased from Biacore. The running buffer was 1× BB containing 0.005% Tween 20. For kinetic studies, streptavidin in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, at 5 μg/ml was covalently coupled to the carboxymethylated dextran matrix on all four flow cells using amine coupling reagents N-ethyl-N′-(3-diethylamino propyl)carbodiimide and N-hydroxysuccinimide according to the preset software specifications (Biacore AB). Typically, 450-500 resonance units of streptavidin was immobilized. To flow cells 1 and 2, saturating amounts of linker oligonucleotide (1 μm in 1× BB), which is complementary to 5′ primer-binding site of the aptamer (5′-CGTTTATTCTGAGCTCCC-biotin-3′), were injected at 30 μl/min for 30 s. This process was repeated for flow cells 3 and 4 using a linker oligonucleotide that was complementary to the 3′ primer-binding site (5′-biotin-GATCCGGGCCTCATG-3′). Aptamers (200 nm in 1× BB) were then injected over the biotinylated linker/streptavidin complex on flow cell 2 and 4 at a flow rate of 5 μl/min for 5 min. In some cases duplex formation was linker-specific in that some aptamers would only form a duplex with either the 5′ or 3′ linker oligonucleotide. The experiments were performed on flow cells where 20-50 resonance units of linker/aptamer partial duplex was formed.For kinetic studies, a concentration series of prothrombin in running buffer was injected at a flow rate of 100 μl/min over the linker and linker/aptamer flow cells at 20 °C. The association and dissociation phases were each monitored for 3 min, and the flow cells were regenerated with a pulse of 0.05% SDS. To determine error margins, two experiments were performed for each aptamer. This included stripping the aptamer from the flow cell with a pulse of 10 mm NaOH and then reforming the duplex and repeating the same concentration series of prothrombin.When analyzing the data, the signals generated from injections of prothrombin over the linker only reference flow cell and those generated from injection of running buffer over the aptamer flow cell were subtracted from sensorgrams obtained for prothrombin injected over the aptamer flow cell. Rate constants (ka and kd) were obtained using global data fitting algorithms assuming a Langmuir (1:1) binding isotherm (BIAevaluation V3.1 software; Biacore). The equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) was determined from the ratio kd/ka.Prothrombin Depletion—A 5′-biotinylated prothrombin aptamer (F1.06; see Fig. 3 for sequence) truncated to remove primer-binding sites was used. Plasma (60 μl), dialyzed against 1× BB, was mixed with 100 pmol of biotinylated oligonucleotide in a volume of 100 μl for 2 h at room temperature. Prothrombin-aptamer complexes were captured using streptavidin-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and, recovered by spin filtration. Three cycles of aptamer mediated depletion were performed and the captured prothrombin together with known quantities of bovine serum albumin were analyzed on 8% SDS-PAGE. To quantitate prothrombin extraction and check for the presence of other plasma proteins, the gels were stained with SYPRO Orange (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and viewed on a Typhoon FluorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Prothrombin-depleted plasma was subsequently coupled to CH-Sepharose, and an in vitro selection was performed as described above.RESULTSAptamer Library Screening Strategy—In light of the large number of variables that could influence the outcome of an aptamer library screen, we deliberately chose the simplest selection protocol possible that included using a library with a moderately sized random sequence region. We anticipated that results from such a screen would indicate whether more sophisticated strategies were needed and what form they might take.A library of ∼1014 single-stranded DNA molecules was incubated with unfractionated plasma proteins coupled to activated Sepharose beads. The quantity of beads and therefore the concentration of target remained constant throughout the screen as did the washing and elution conditions. A trace amount of 32P-labeled aptamer pool was included at each cycle of selection to monitor enrichment of specific binding sequences. Targets for individual aptamers were identified by incubating plasma with 5′-biotinylated aptamer, trapping the complex on streptavidin-Sepharose, and then analyzing the bound protein by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein identification by this method was limited by the resolving capacity of the gel and the sensitivity of the silver staining method used. Despite these limitations, this format was considered the best option given the large number of aptamers to be assayed.Dynamics of Aptamer Library Screening against a Complex Target—The DNA aptamer library contained a random sequence region of 45 nucleotides flanked by two 20-nucleotide regions for amplification. The amount of library used in a screen is a important variable, and we chose what corresponded to an average value (4.5 μg) obtained from the literature. It is common to quote a figure for the sequence complexity rather than a mass, but in our view the former is impossible to estimate accurately because of template bias that manifests itself at several steps during the creation of the library. A relatively modest amount of target was used (300 μg), especially considering the abundance of albumin. We reasoned that if albumin was going to dominate the screen, then increasing the amount of target would not significantly increase our chances of isolating aptamers that bound to other proteins. A total of 13 cycles of selection were performed, and the amount of bead-bound aptamer was measured after each cycle. Significant binding above background was detected after cycle five, and this increased to a total of 12% at the last cycle (Fig. 1).FIGURE 1Monitoring in vitro selection cycles. Specific binding of aptamers to plasma proteins (squares) was monitored by including tracer quantities of [γ-32P]ATP end-labeled ssDNA in the aptamer population at each cycle. The amount of radioactivity in 5% of the recovered ssDNA was determined by liquid scintillation counting and expressed as a percentage of the input counts/min for each cycle. Background binding (triangles) was determined by a negative selection step performed for every cycle with Sepharose that had been reacted with Tris-HCl instead of plasma. The graph shows that only background binding was detected up to cycle 5. A progressive increase in binding above background was observed from cycle 6 until the selection was terminated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Aliquots of selected pools from cycles 3-12 were cloned, randomly chosen colonies were picked, and their inserts were sequenced. The resultant data were then analyzed with the SPLASH pattern algorithm to identify common sequence motifs. Homology between different aptamers suggests they might bind to the same target and is an indirect measure of the degree of enrichment obtained at any stage of the in vitro selection process. In addition to searching for multiple representations of a motif at any cycle of selection, we also followed individual sequences with increasing cycles of selection to see whether their relative frequency in the population changed.The level of sequence diversity observed within aptamer families was highly variable, with some families exhibiting less than 5% sequence variation between clones, whereas others were characterized by small highly conserved consensus motifs (data not shown).

https://openalex.org/W2128493707,"20-Carboxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-COOH-AA) is a bioactive metabolite of 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE), an eicosanoid that produces vasoconstriction in the cerebral circulation. We found that smooth muscle (MSMC) and endothelial (MEC) cultures obtained from mouse brain microvessels convert [3H]20-HETE to 20-COOH-AA, indicating that the cerebral vasculature can produce this metabolite. The [3H]20-COOH-AA accumulated primarily in the culture medium, together with additional radiolabeled metabolites identified as the chain-shortened dicarboxylic acids 18-COOH-18:4, 18-COOH-18:3, and 16-COOH-16:3. N-Heptylformamide, a potent inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), decreased the conversion of [3H]20-HETE to 20-COOH-AA by the MSMC and MEC and also by isolated mouse brain microvessels. Purified mouse and human ADH4, human ADH3, and horse liver ADH1 efficiently oxidized 20-HETE, and ADH4 and ADH3 were detected in MSMC and MEC by Western blotting. N-Heptylformamide inhibited the oxidation of 20-HETE by mouse and human ADH4 but not by ADH3. These results demonstrated that cerebral microvessels convert 20-HETE to 20-COOH-AA and that ADH catalyzes the reaction. Although ADH4 and ADH3 are expressed in MSMC and MEC, the inhibition produced by N-heptylformamide suggests that ADH4 is primarily responsible for 20-COOH-AA formation in the cerebral microvasculature. 20-Carboxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-COOH-AA) is a bioactive metabolite of 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE), an eicosanoid that produces vasoconstriction in the cerebral circulation.

Radiolabeled substrates of the necessary concentration and specific activity for each experiment were prepared by mixing the [3H]20-HETE with 20-HETE purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI) or [3H]20-COOH-AA with 20-COOH-AA synthesized as described previously (19Kaduce T.L.

Analysis of the Medium and Cell Lipids—After the medium was acidified to pH 4 with formic acid, the lipids were extracted with 4 volumes of ice-cold water-saturated ethyl acetate. The lipid-soluble radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting using Budget SolveTM scintillation solution (Research Products International, Mount Prospect, IL) and a Beckman LS-3801 scintillation counter. Reverse-phase HPLC with an in-line flow scintillation counter was used to determine the distribution of the lipid radioactivity (19Kaduce T.L. Fang X. Harmon S.D. Oltman C.L. Dellsperger K.C.

Following removal of the ethyl acetate under N2, the lipids were dissolved in acetonitrile and separated by HPLC on a 4.6 × 150 mm DiscoveryTM C18 column (Supelco Inc., Bellefonte, PA) with a dual pump gradient system (Gilson Inc., Middleton, WI). The solvent system contained H2O adjusted to pH 4.0 with formic acid and an acetonitrile gradient that increased from 30 to 100% over 70 min at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min. Radioactivity was measured by mixing the column effluent with Budget SolveTM scintillation solution at a 3:1 ratio and then passing the mixture through the flow scintillation detector (IN/US Systems, Inc., Tampa, FL). The cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and harvested by scraping into ice-cold methanol/formic acid (100:1 v/v). Lipids then were extracted by addition of 2 volumes of chloroform, and the phases were separated by addition of 0.25 volume of 154 mm NaCl. The chloroform phase was dried under N2 and dissolved in chloroform/methanol. An aliquot was dried and assayed for radioactivity in a liquid scintillation counter, and the lipids contained in another aliquot were separated by thin layer chromatography. The remainder was hydrolyzed by saponification, and the distribution of radioactivity was determined by reverse-phase HPLC (19Kaduce T.L. Fang X. Harmon S.D. Oltman C.L. Dellsperger K.C. Teesch L.M.

A Hewlett-Packard 1100 MSD liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC/MS) system was used to separate and identify the metabolites formed by the cells from either 20-HETE or [16,16,17,17,18,18-2H]20-HETE ([2H6]20-HETE) purchased from Cayman Chemical (19Kaduce T.L.

The HPLC separation used a Supelco C18 5 μm 4.6 × 150 mm DiscoveryTM column and a solvent system containing H2O and acetonitrile, both acidified with formic acid (100:0.03 v/v), at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min. The gradient began with 0% acetonitrile and was increased to 95% acetonitrile over 25 min. Negative ion electrospray was used with the fragmenter voltage set at 110 V; the N2 nebulizing gas was maintained at 60 bars, and the N2 drying gas was set to a flow rate of 10 liters/min at 350 °C. A Hewlett-Packard ChemstationTM software program was employed to process the data. Western Blot Analysis of ADH—MSMC and MEC were washed twice with PBS and then scraped into a lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmol/liter diethyldithiocarbamic acid, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1% sodium deoxycholate. Homogenates were prepared by sonication on ice for 3 cycles of 10–20 s, with intermittent cooling, and the protein content was determined with the protein assay reagent (Bio Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Proteins (50 μg) were separated in 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by electroblotting at 100 V for 75 min. Blots were blocked by incubation with 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 and 5% (w/v) solution of dried skimmed milk dissolved in NaCl/Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), at room temperature for 70 min and then incubated with a 1:500 dilution of rabbit antiserum raised against mouse ADH4, ADH3, or ADH1 (33Haselbeck R.J. Duester G. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 1997; 21: 1484-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The blot was then incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody (1: 4,000). Antibody labeling was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence with an ECL detection system (Pierce). The blots were then stripped and reprobed for β-actin with a mouse monoclonal IgG (1:2,500) and anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase (1:4,000). β-Actin was used as the control for protein loading and transfer (30Fang X.

To control for the specificity of the ADH4 antibody, homogenates of stomachs from normal and Adh4 gene-deleted mice also were prepared and included in the assay. The mutant mice lack ADH4 in stomach and other tissues as demonstrated by Western blots and have impaired metabolism of retinol (34Deltour L. Foglio M.H. Duester G. Dev.

Detection and Analysis of ADH Products—The isolated mouse and human ADH4, human ADH3, and horse liver ADH1 were incubated at 37 °C with either 1 or 2 μm [3H]20-HETE with 1 mm NAD+, and the radiolabeled products were separated by HPLC and detected with the in-line flow scintillation counter. In additional studies, mouse ADH4 was incubated with 20-HETE and NAD+, and the products were analyzed by LC/MS with the Hewlett-Packard 1100 MSD LC/MS system as described previously (19Kaduce T.L. Fang X. Harmon S.D. Oltman C.L. Dellsperger K.C. Teesch L.M. Gopal V.R. Falck J.R. Campbell W.B. Weintraub N.L. Spector A.A. J. Biol.

Statistical Analysis—Data were expressed as mean ± S.E. Analysis of variance, followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls method, was used to compare the conversion of 20-HETE to 20-COOH-AA under control and treatment conditions. Differences with p < 0.05 are considered significant. 20-HETE Conversion to 20-COOH-AA by Cultured Cells—We first determined whether 20-HETE contained in MSMC can be converted to 20-COOH-AA. It was necessary to load the MSMC with [3H]20-HETE to obtain enough intracellular radioactivity for metabolic studies. In preliminary experiments, we found that MSMC incubated with [3H]20-HETE took up increasing amounts of radioactivity during a 4-h incubation. The distribution of the radioactivity in the cell lipid extract as determined by thin layer chromatography was 75% in phospholipids, 16% in neutral lipid esters, and 9% as fatty acid after 1 h of incubation. This distribution did not change appreciably as the incubation continued. HPLC analysis of the hydrolyzed cell lipid extract showed that 99% of the radioactivity incorporated into the cells after 1 h remained as 20-HETE. After 2 h, 94% of the radioactivity still was present as 20-HETE. This distribution did not change appreciably when the incubation was extended to 4 h. The retention and metabolism of the incorporated [3H]20-HETE were determined during subsequent incubation of the MSMC. Fig. 1 shows the changes in distribution of lipid radioactivity in the cells and medium when MSMC containing [3H]20-HETE were washed and then incubated for 1–8 h in fresh medium. Although no agonist was added to the cultures to stimulate the mobilization of endogenous lipids, the radiolabeled lipid content of the cells declined 40%, and a similar amount of radiolabeled lipid accumulated in the medium over the course of the incubation. Fig. 2 shows the HPLC analysis of the radiolabeled lipids recovered from the medium during the 8-h incubation. A metabolite with the same retention time as [3H]20-COOH-AA (19Kaduce T.L. Fang X.

In addition, 6% of the radioactivity present in the medium after 4 h eluted with a retention time of 26.3 min, designated as X, and 11% eluted with a retention time of 22 min, designated as Y. Fig. 2 shows that these products continued to build up and accounted for 6 and 17%, respectively, at the end of the 8-h incubation.FIGURE 2HPLC analysis of radiolabeled lipids released into the medium by mouse cerebral microvascular smooth muscle cells labeled with [3H]20-HETE. The methods and incubation conditions are the same as described in Fig. 1, except that the radiolabeled lipids released into the medium were separated and assayed by HPLC with an in-line flow scintillation counter. The solvent system contained H2O adjusted to pH 4.0 with formic acid and an acetonitrile gradient that increased from 30 to 100% over 70 min at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min. In addition to the main radiolabeled product, 20-COOH-AA, and 20-HETE, radiolabeled metabolites designated as X and Y were detected. Representative chromatograms from a single culture are shown from the incubations lasting 1 (A), 4 (B), and 8 h (C). Similar results were obtained from two additional cultures at each of these times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Additional studies demonstrated that MEC also converted [3H]20-HETE to 20-COOH-AA. During a continuous incubation with 2 μm [3H]20-HETE for 4 h, 12% of the lipid radioactivity in the medium was present as 20-COOH-AA and 39% as other products, and this increased to 17 and 58%, respectively, after 8 h (data not shown). Identification of the 20-HETE Metabolites—MSMC cultures were incubated with either 20-HETE or [2H6]20-HETE, and the products contained in the lipid extract of the media were separated by liquid chromatography and identified by negative ion electrospray mass spectrometry at 110 V. Fig. 3, A–D, shows the mass spectra obtained from the incubation with 20-HETE, and Fig. 3, E–H, shows the corresponding spectra from the incubation with [2H6]20-HETE.

https://openalex.org/W1995536881,"The metabotropic gamma-aminobutyric acid, type B (GABA(B)) receptors mediate the slow component of GABAergic transmission in the brain. Functional GABA(B) receptors are heterodimers of the two subunits GABA(B1) and GABA(B2), of which GABA(B1) exists in two main isoforms, GABA(B1a) and GABA(B1b). The significance of the structural heterogeneity of GABA(B) receptors, the mechanism leading to their differential targeting in neurons as well as the regulation of cell surface numbers of GABA(B) receptors, is poorly understood. To gain insights into these processes, we searched for proteins interacting with the C-terminal domain of GABA(B2). Here, we showed that the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) homologous protein (CHOP) directly interacts with GABA(B) receptors in a subtype-selective manner to regulate cell surface expression of GABA(B1a)/GABA(B2) receptors upon co-expression in HEK 293 cells. The interaction of CHOP with GABA(B1a)/GABA(B2) receptors resulted in their intracellular accumulation and in a reduced number of cell surface receptors. This regulation required the interaction of CHOP via two distinct domains with the heterodimeric receptor; its C-terminal leucine zipper associates with the leucine zipper present in the C-terminal domain of GABA(B2), and its N-terminal domain associates with an as yet unidentified site on GABA(B1a). In conclusion, the data indicated a subtype-selective regulation of cell surface receptors by interaction with the transcription factor CHOP."

In this study, site-directed mutagenesis was employed to probe the function of residues within the Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNAPII active center in the mechanism of transcription start site utilization. We report here the identification of two mutations in the switch 2 region, rpb1-K332A and rpb1-R344A, which conferred conditional growth properties and downstream shifts in start site utilization. Analyses of double mutant strains demonstrated functional interactions between these switch 2 mutations and a mutation in the largest subunit of transcription factor IIF (TFIIF) that confers upstream shifts in start site usage. Importantly, biochemical analyses demonstrated that purified Rpb1-R344A mutant polymerase exhibited impaired ability to stabilize a short RNA-DNA hybrid in the active center, an increased frequency of abortive transcription in runoff assays, and both a downstream shift and increased abortive initiation in reconstituted transcription assays. These results provide evidence for a role of switch 2 during start site utilization and indicate that RNA-DNA hybrid stability at the 3′-end of the transcript is a determinant in this process.

Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 394-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 2Orphanides G. Lagrange T. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2657-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). In higher eukaryotes, transcription initiation typically occurs ∼30 base pairs downstream of a TATA element. In contrast, mRNA 5′-ends in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae frequently map to multiple sites within a window ranging from 40 to 120 base pairs or greater downstream of a TATA element (3Guarente L.

Although the precise mechanism by which RNAPII recognizes and productively utilizes a potential start site remains to be elucidated, previous studies have firmly established that RNAPII and the general transcription factors IIB (TFIIB) and IIF (TFIIF) play important roles in determining the position of mRNA 5′-ends in S. cerevisiae. Numerous genetic and biochemical studies of S. cerevisiae TFIIB conducted in our laboratory and by others have shown that amino acid substitutions in a highly conserved N-terminal region of TFIIB can alter the position of mRNA 5′-ends both in vivo and in vitro (5Zhang D.Y.

Specifically, these TFIIB mutations confer a downstream shift in start site utilization, i.e. diminished utilization of sites located proximal to the TATA element with accompanying enhanced utilization of sites located further downstream. Interestingly, the structural determination of an S. cerevisiae TFIIB-RNAPII co-crystal has revealed that this N-terminal region of TFIIB adopts a finger-like structure that projects into the RNA exit channel of the polymerase and is positioned to potentially make contact with a short RNA-DNA hybrid in the active center (11Bushnell D.A. Westover K.D. Davis R.E. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2004; 303: 983-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In contrast to the downstream shifts conferred by TFIIB mutations, we recently reported that mutations in either the Tfg1 or Tfg2 subunits of S. cerevisiae TFIIF can cause upstream shifts in the position of mRNA 5′-ends both in vivo and in vitro (12Ghazy M.A. Brodie S.A. Ammerman M.L. Ziegler L.M. Ponticelli A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10975-10985Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Upstream shifts can also result from mutation or deletion of the small nonessential Rpb9 subunit of S. cerevisiae RNAPII (13Hull M.W. McKune K. Woychik N.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 14Sun Z.W. Tessmer A. Hampsey M.

Although the precise mechanism by which these TFIIF or Rpb9 mutations cause upstream shifts remains unknown, biochemical analyses have shown that these mutations alter TFIIF-RNAPII interaction and that the degree of impairment in this interaction conferred by a given mutation directly correlates with the severity in the degree of upstream shifts (12Ghazy M.A. Brodie S.A. Ammerman M.L. Ziegler L.M. Ponticelli A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10975-10985Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In a previous genetic study, Hampsey and colleagues (16Berroteran R.W. Ware D.E. Hampsey M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 226-237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) identified a mutation in the S. cerevisiae RPB1 gene, encoding the largest subunit of RNAPII, that caused downstream shifts similar to those conferred by TFIIB mutations (16Berroteran R.W. Ware D.E. Hampsey M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 226-237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The determination of the S. cerevisiae RNAPII crystal structure demonstrates that this mutation (N445S) mapped to the vicinity of the polymerase active center (17Cramer P. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2001; 292: 1863-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). Based upon this observation, we initiated a site-directed mutagenesis study of the active center to potentially identify residues in Rpb1 that play critical roles in the mechanism of normal start site usage. We report here the identification of two rpb1 mutations, rpb1-K332A and rpb1-R344A, that confer altered growth properties and pronounced downstream shifts in start site utilization. Examination of the location of residues Lys-332 and Arg-344 in more recent structural determinations of a transcribing polymerase complex (18Kettenberger H. Armache K.J. Cramer P. Mol.

Results from gel mobility shift assays demonstrated that wild-type and Rpb1-R344A mutant polymerase exhibited comparable activities for DNA binding and for the formation of RNAPII·DNA·RNA complexes containing a complementary 9-nucleotide RNA in the active center. In striking contrast, the mutant polymerase was severely impaired for the generation of stable RNAPII·DNA·RNA complexes containing a complementary 5-nucleotide RNA. Importantly, purified Rpb1-R344A polymerase also exhibited an increased frequency of abortive transcription at A-U base pairs at the 3′-end of the RNA-DNA hybrid in runoff transcription assays and both a downstream shift in start site utilization and a relative increase in the level of abortive transcripts in transcription reactions reconstituted with purified yeast general factors. We discuss a model that incorporates the role of RNA-DNA hybrid stability in the formation of productive mRNA 5′-ends and the concerted roles played by TFIIB, TFIIF, and RNAPII during this process.

Reactions (20 μl) contained 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 5% glycerol, 20 mm potassium acetate, 30 mm potassium chloride, 7.5 mm magnesium acetate, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 25 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 pmol of the 5′-end-labeled or unlabeled DNA38, 0.2 pmol of wild-type or R344A polymerase, and 0.5 pmol of [32P]RNA9 or [32P]RNA5, as indicated in the figure legends. Transcription Assays—For runoff transcription, RNAPII·DNA·[32P]RNA complexes were assembled under the conditions used in the mobility shift assays, and transcription was initiated by the addition of unlabeled NTPs to a final concentration of 50 μm. Reactions were incubated at ambient temperature for 10 min, and a portion was analyzed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (24% acrylamide 12:1, 7 m urea). Reconstituted reactions using purified RNAPII and general transcription factors were performed as described previously (15Ziegler L.M. Khaperskyy D.A. Ammerman M.L. Ponticelli A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48950-48956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For dinucleotide-primed reactions, transcription complexes were assembled for 10 min at ambient temperature. The dinucleotide was then added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and incubation continued for an additional 15 min. Transcription was then initiated by the addition of NTPs (100 μm ATP, 100 μm GTP, 100 μm UTP, 1.67 μm CTP, 111 nm [α-32P]CTP final concentration). After 20 min at ambient temperature, transcription was terminated by heat inactivation at 95 °C for 3 min. Reactions were then treated for 15 min at 37 °C with 5 units of DNase I followed by treatment with 1.5 units of proteinase K for 15 min at 37 °C. A portion was analyzed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7.5% acrylamide 19:1, 7 m urea). Mutations in the Switch 2 Region of the RNAPII Active Center Confer Downstream Shifts in Transcription Start Site Utilization—To identify residues within the S. cerevisiae RNAPII active center that play critical roles in start site utilization, site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce alanine substitutions of highly conserved residues in the Rpb1 subunit. The rpb1 mutant plasmids were initially tested for their ability to support viability using the plasmid-shuffle complementation assay and strain FP294. Of the 29 plasmids tested, all were competent for supporting viability on 5-FOA medium (data not shown). When tested for growth on rich medium at varying temperatures, 27 of the mutants grew indistinguishably from the wild-type strain. These included mutants containing the rpb1 substitutions, N339A, D346A, V352A, P357A, L359A, Q363A, D408A, G410A, D411A, D411K, R412A, I413A, D414A, D414K, L415A, R416A, Y417A, S418A, K419A, R420E, L443A, R446A, V474A, Y478A, M487A, P492A, and L504A (data not shown). The remaining two mutants, which contained the rpb1-K332A or rpb1-R344A substitutions, exhibited diminished growth at all temperatures tested (Fig. 1A). To analyze the effects of these rpb1 mutations on transcription initiation in vivo, primer extension was employed to map the transcription start sites utilized at the ADH1 promoter in the mutant strains. Compared with the wild-type strain, the rpb1-K332A and rpb1-R344A mutants both displayed the classic pattern of downstream shifts in start site usage, with the rpb1-R344A allele conferring more pronounced shifts (Fig. 1B). Examination of the location of residues Lys-332 and Arg-344 in the RNAPII crystal structure revealed that both residues reside within the switch 2 region. Switch 2 has been proposed to be relatively disordered prior to the transition to a transcribing complex but, upon the transition, adopts a more ordered structure that becomes positioned in the active center to potentially contact the RNA-DNA hybrid (17Cramer P. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2001; 292: 1863-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar, 19Gnatt A.L. Cramer P. Fu J. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2001; 292: 1876-1882Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). To further investigate the potential role of switch 2 in start site utilization, we tested whether the rpb1-K332A and rpb1-R344A mutations functionally interact with the tfg1-E346A mutation in the largest subunit of TFIIF, which we recently reported confers upstream shifts in start site utilization in vivo and in vitro (12Ghazy M.A. Brodie S.A. Ammerman M.L. Ziegler L.M. Ponticelli A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10975-10985Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Analysis of the growth properties and in vivo initiation patterns of single and double mutant strains demonstrated that the rpb1-K332A,tfg1-E346A double mutant exhibited better growth than either the rpb1-K332A or tfg1-E346A single mutants and a partial suppression of the upstream shifts caused by tfg1-E346A (Fig. 2A; 2B, lanes 1-4). Analysis of the rpb1-R344A,tfg1-E346A double mutant demonstrated that the rpb1-R344A mutation was more effective at suppressing the upstream shifts due to tfg1-E346A, but the double mutant was not detectably healthier than either of the corresponding single mutants, presumably because of the relative persistence of the stronger downstream shifts conferred by rpb1-R344A (Fig. 2A;2B, lanes 5 and 6). Taken together, these results indicate that the switch 2 region of S. cerevisae RNAPII plays a functional role during start site utilization. The Rpb1-R344A Mutant Polymerase Is Impaired for the Generation of Stable RNAPII·DNA·RNA Complexes Containing a Five-nucleotide RNA—A recent high resolution structural determination of the transcribing RNAPII complex (20Westover K.D. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2004; 303: 1014-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the side chain of Arg-344 is within 3.1 Å of the DNA phosphate between positions -2 and -3 relative to the site of nucleotide addition, whereas the Lys-332 side chain is within 4.9 Å of the DNA phosphate between position -1 and the site of nucleotide addition (Fig. 3A). The proximity of the Lys-332 and Arg-344 basic side chains to the DNA template strand suggested that these residues might play a role in stabilizing DNA binding and/or the RNA-DNA hybrid in the active center. To address this, we developed a gel mobility shift assay to determine the relative activities of the wild-type and Rpb1-R344A polymerases for template DNA binding and for the generation of stable RNAPII·DNA·RNA complexes. Using the same oligonucleotides that were employed in the crystal structure determination (20Westover K.D. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2004; 303: 1014-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), the results from these binding assays demonstrated that the wild-type and Rpb1-R344A polymerases exhibited comparable activities for binding the 38-nucleotide DNA template ([32P]DNA38) (Fig. 3B, lanes 1-3), and for the formation of RNAPII·DNA·[32P]RNA complexes containing the complementary 9-nucleotide RNA in the active center (Fig. 3B, lanes 4-6). In striking contrast, the mutant polymerase was severely impaired for the generation of stable RNAPII·DNA·[32P]RNA complexes containing a complementary 5-nucleotide RNA (Fig. 3B, lanes 7-9 and 7*-9*). The Rpb1-R344A Polymerase Exhibits Increased Abortive Transcription at A-U Base Pairs at the 3′-End of the RNA-DNA Hybrid—To test the functionality of the RNAPII·DNA·[32P]RNA complexes containing wild-type or switch 2 mutant polymerase, binding reactions were performed as in the mobility shift assays to allow for complex formation, and runoff transcription was then initiated by the addition of unlabeled NTPs. The results confirmed that RNA5 and RNA9 could be extended upon the addition of NTPs, consistent with their position in the active center (Fig. 4A). Importantly however, these results revealed that the Rpb1-R344A mutant polymerase exhibited increased abortive transcription from complexes containing either [32P]RNA5 (Fig. 4A, lanes 2-4) or [32P]RNA9 (Fig. 4A, lanes 5-7). The major termination products, 19 and 20 nucleotides in the reactions containing [32P]RNA9, were present to a lesser extent in the reactions containing the wild-type polymerase and corresponded to transcripts that terminated with one or two consecutive uridylates at the 3′-end of the transcript (Fig. 4C). To further test whether the observed increase in abortive transcription with the mutant polymerase correlated with the presence of an A-U base pair at the 3′-end of the RNA-DNA hybrid, the runoff assays were performed using DNA template oligonucleotides that either lacked adenosines downstream of the sequence complementary to RNA9 (DNA48A-) or contained two adenosines positioned 17 nucleotides downstream (DNA48A2). The results demonstrated that the wild-type and mutant polymerase exhibited indistinguishable runoff transcription patterns from complexes containing DNA48A- (Fig. 4B, lanes 1-3), but that the mutant polymerase again displayed increased abortive transcription at the position of the adenosines in DNA48A2 (Fig. 4B, lanes 5-7). Similar results were obtained using [32P]RNA5 priming of templates DNA48A- and DNA48A2 (data not shown). The Rpb1-R344A Polymerase Confers Downstream Shifts in Start Site Utilization and Increased Abortive Initiation in Reconstituted Transcription Assays—The preceding results from the runoff transcription assays indicated that purified Rpb1-R344A polymerase was more prone to abortive transcription than wild-type RNAPII. However, because the runoff reactions utilized preformed RNAPII·DNA·[32P]RNA complexes in the absence of any additional factors, reconstituted transcription assays were next performed to determine the relative activities of the mutant and wild-type polymerases in the presence of all of the yeast general factors. In the initial experiment, standard reconstituted reactions were carried out with unlabeled NTPs, and the products were analyzed by primer extension. The results showed that, compared with the reaction containing wild-type RNAPII, the Rpb1-R344A RNAPII produced a downstream shift in start site utilization and a general decrease in the overall level of transcription (Fig. 5C). To determine whether the Rpb1-R344A mutant polymerase exhibited an increased frequency of abortive initiation, reconstituted reactions were primed with the addition of an excess of the dinucleotide ApG (to prime the -37 and -27 start sites) or CpG (to prime the -91 start site). Transcription was then initiated by the addition of unlabeled ATP, GTP, UTP, and [α-32P]CTP, and the labeled products were analyzed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In the reactions containing Rpb1-R344A RNAPII (Fig. 5A, lanes 3 and 5), the amount of full-length transcript was significantly lower than in the reactions containing wild-type polymerase (Fig. 5A, lanes 2 and 4). Importantly however, the amounts of the major aborted transcripts (∼20-25 nucleotides) were comparable in the reactions containing wild-type or mutant polymerase. Quantitation of the major aborted and full-length transcripts by phosphorimaging demonstrated that the relative ratio of aborted:full-length transcripts was ∼2.5 times greater in the reactions containing Rpb1-R344A RNAPII (Fig. 5B). Thus, these results indicate that the Rpb1-R344A switch 2 mutant polymerase is not only more prone to transcription termination in runoff transcription with purified enzyme but also exhibits an increased frequency of abortive initiation in reconstituted transcription assays. In this work, we employed site-directed mutagenesis to identify residues in the S. cerevisiae RNAPII active center that play critical roles in the mechanism of transcription start site utilization. Two such residues in the switch 2 region of the Rpb1 subunit, Arg-344 and Lys-332, were identified as playing important functional roles during start site usage. This was evidenced by (i) strains containing the rpb1-R344A or rpb1-K332A mutations exhibiting conditional growth phenotypes and downstream shifts in start site utilization in vivo (Fig. 1) and (ii) the ability of the rpb1-R344A and rpb1-K332A mutations to partially suppress the upstream shifts that are conferred by the tfg1-E346A mutation in the largest subunit of TFIIF (Fig. 2). To gain insight into the specific roles played by Arg-344 and Lys-332, we examined the location of these residues in the reported crystal structure of a transcribing S. cerevisiae polymerase complex (20Westover K.D. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2004; 303: 1014-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In this structure, Arg-344 is within 3.1 Å of the DNA phosphate between positions -2 and -3 relative to the site of nucleotide addition (+1), and Lys-332 is within 4.9 Å of the DNA phosphate between position -1 and +1 (Fig. 3A). The location of these residues suggested a potential role for them in stabilizing DNA binding and/or the RNA-DNA hybrid. The significance of their location in regards to the mechanism of start site utilization is further substantiated by the observation that Rpb1 Asn-445, previously identified by a mutation conferring downstream shifts similar to those reported here (16Berroteran R.W. Ware D.E. Hampsey M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 226-237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is positioned 8-9 Å from the DNA phosphate between positions -2 and -3. Results from mobility shift assays demonstrated that the Rpb1-R344A mutant polymerase was as proficient as wild-type RNAPII for DNA38 binding and for the formation of RNAPII·DNA·RNA9 complexes but was severely impaired for the generation of stable complexes containing RNA5 (Fig. 3B). More significantly, the results from runoff transcription of RNAPII·DNA·RNA complexes revealed that the wild-type and mutant polymerases were indistinguishable in reactions containing an A-less DNA template but that the mutant polymerase exhibited increased abortive transcription from A-containing templates at locations corresponding to the presence of one or two uridylates at the 3′-end of the transcript (Fig. 4). Results from reconstituted transcription assays using purified yeast general factors demonstrated that the Rpb1-R344A polymerase was competent for initiation, conferred a downstream shift in start site utilization, and exhibited a relative increase in the frequency of abortive initiation (Fig. 5). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the underlying basis for the downstream shifts conferred by the Rpb1-R344A switch 2 mutant polymerase is impairment in the ability to stabilize the weaker A-U base pairs in the RNA-DNA hybrid immediately upstream of the site of nucleotide addition. Based upon the results from this study and from previous work, we propose a model for the concerted roles played by TFIIB, TFIIF, and switch 2 during the mechanism by which a potential start site is productively utilized (Fig. 6). Shown at the top is the proposed mechanism for the formation of an mRNA 5′-end in a wild-type strain. Upon encountering a proposed PyAa/tPu consensus start site, RNA synthesis is initiated and the short RNA-DNA hybrid is initially stabilized by the TFIIB finger through protein-nucleic acid and/or protein-protein interactions. For the generation of a productive transcript, continued synthesis requires the complex to undergo a conformational change, perhaps mediated by TFIIF, that repositions switch 2 in the active center to stabilize the 3′-end of the RNA-DNA hybrid. This stabilization is proposed to substitute for the initial TFIIB-mediated stabilization, thereby allowing the TFIIB finger to be withdrawn from the active center to avoid steric clash with the growing RNA. For switch 2 mutants, impaired stabilization of the 3′-end of the RNA-DNA hybrid leads to an increased frequency of abortive initiation. However, we suggest that abortive initiation at a site proximal to a TATA element is followed by continued translocation of the RNAPII machinery and re-initiation, thereby increasing the levels of transcripts with 5′-ends mapping further downstream than normal (downstream shifts). Similarly, TFIIB finger mutations are proposed to impair the initial stabilization of the RNA-DNA hybrid, again leading to increased abortive initiation and re-initiation further downstream. In regards to the role of TFIIF, we suggest that a TFIIF-RNAPII interaction modulates the conformational change of the complex that is associated with the withdrawal of the TFIIB finger from the active center and the transition to a transcribing complex. Alteration of this interaction, either by TFIIF or Rpb9 mutations, results in a complex that more readily undergoes the transition. Accordingly, we propose that abortive initiation at start sites encountered early during translocation is diminished, thereby increasing the levels of transcripts with 5′-ends mapping further upstream than normal (upstream shifts). Ongoing biochemical analyses should provide additional insight into the concerted roles of switch 2, TFIIB, and TFIIF during start site utilization. We thank Michelle Ammerman and Drs. Ken Blumenthal, Jim Hernandez, Ed Niles, and Mark Sutton for helpful discussions and comments on the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2139393829,"This study challenges the conventional view that metalloporphyrins protect cultured cortical neurons in models of cerebral ischemia by acting as intracellular catalytic antioxidants [superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimetics]. High SOD-active Mn(III)porphyrins meso-substituted with N,N'-dimethylimidazolium or N-alkylpyridinium groups did not protect neurons against oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), although lower SOD-active and -inactive para isomers protected against N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) exposure. Mn(III)meso-tetrakis(4-benzoic acid)porphyrin (Mn(III)TBAP), as well as SOD-inactive metalloTBAPs and other phenyl ring- or beta-substituted metalloporphyrins that contained redox-insensitive metals, protected cultures against OGD and NMDA neurotoxicity. Crucially, neuroprotective metalloporphyrins suppressed OGD- or NMDA-induced rises in intracellular Ca2+ concentration in the same general rank order as observed for neuroprotection. Results from paraquat toxicity, intracellular fluorescence quenching, electrophysiology, mitochondrial Ca2+, and spontaneous synaptic activity experiments suggest a model in which metalloporphyrins, acting at the plasma membrane, protect neurons against OGD by suppressing postsynaptic NMDA receptor-mediated Ca2+ rises, thereby indirectly preventing accumulation of neurotoxic mitochondrial Ca2+ levels. Though neuroprotective in a manner not originally intended, SOD-inactive metalloporphyrins may represent promising therapeutic agents in diseases such as cerebral ischemia, in which Ca2+ toxicity is implicated. Conventional syntheses aimed at improving the catalytic antioxidant capability and/or intracellular access of metalloporphyrins may not yield improved efficacy in some disease models."

Efforts to study the acute effects of GRKs in intact cells have been limited by a lack of specific inhibitors. In the present study we have developed an engineered version of GRK2 that is specifically and reversibly inhibited by the substituted nucleotide analog 1-naphthyl-PP1 (1Na-PP1), and we explored GRK2 function in regulated internalization of the μ-opioid receptor (μOR). A previously described method that conferred analog sensitivity on various kinases, by introducing a space-creating mutation in the conserved active site, failed when applied to GRK2 because the corresponding mutation (L271G) rendered the mutant kinase (GRK2-as1) catalytically inactive. A sequence homology-based approach was used to design second-site suppressor mutations. A C221V second-site mutation produced a mutant kinase (GRK2-as5) with full functional activity and analog sensitivity as compared with wild-type GRK2 in vitro and in intact cells. The role of GRK2-as5 activity in the membrane trafficking of the μOR was also characterized. Morphine-induced internalization was completely blocked when GRK2-as5 activity was inhibited before morphine application. However, inhibition of GRK2-as5 during recycling and reinternalization of the μOR did not attenuate these processes.

An important mechanism that regulates this process is termed receptor desensitization, which results in a reduction in the rate of G protein activation by the agonist-bound receptor complex (5Perry S.J.

Desensitization is thought to be mediated through phosphorylation by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) and second messenger-dependent protein kinases such as cAMP-dependent kinase (PKA), protein kinase C (PKC), and calmodulin-dependent kinase (7Mestek A.

Only GRKs selectively phosphorylate agonist-activated receptors, whereas second messenger-dependent kinases can phosphorylate receptors in the presence or absence of agonist. Receptor phosphorylation by GRKs leads to recruitment of the cytoplasmic accessory proteins, arrestins, to the plasma membrane to target receptors for internalization via clathrin-coated pits (12Goodman Jr., O.B.

For example, in response to morphine, internalization of the μ-opioid receptor (μOR) is strongly dependent on cellular GRK activity. Morphine fails to promote rapid internalization of the μOR in HEK293 cells expressing GRKs at endogenous levels. Overexpression of GRK2 renders morphine capable of promoting rapid phosphorylation and endocytosis of this GPCR (24Zhang J. Ferguson S.S. Barak L.S. Bodduluri S.R. Laporte S.A. Law P.Y. Caron M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7157-7162Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). A major limitation to more definitive studies of agonist-dependent phosphorylation is our inability to specifically manipulate GRK or second messenger kinase activity on a rapid time scale. Phosphorylation and internalization of GPCRs typically occur within minutes after agonist activation. However, there are no specific inhibitors of GRKs or second messenger kinases to assess the role of each kinase in these processes. The inhibitor, staurosporine, which is used to inhibit PKC, can bind with high affinity to over 50 other protein kinases (25Fabian M.A. Biggs 3rd, W.H. Treiber D.K. Atteridge C.E.

The only known inhibitor of GRK2, heparin, requires incubation overnight in the cell media with lipids in order to effect GRK activity (26Hasbi A. Allouche S. Sichel F. Stanasila L. Massotte D. Landemore G. Polastron J. Jauzac P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 293: 237-247PubMed Google Scholar). However, the effects of heparin can only block GRK activity before agonist is applied; the role of GRK2 during other membrane trafficking events such as internalization, recycling, and resensitization has not been evaluated. Available genetic techniques to manipulate kinase function in vivo, such as overexpression, gene knock-out, and knock-down are specific but also suffer from lack of temporal control. Thus, an ideal tool for studying the functional consequences of agonist-induced kinase activity in vivo would be a cell-permeable small molecule drug that could specifically inhibit a single kinase isozyme in intact cells, without producing off-target or biochemical effects. Our laboratory has developed a chemical genetic approach to specifically inhibit any protein kinase. Substitution of a single conserved amino acid, termed the gatekeeper residue, in the active site creates an analog-sensitive (as) kinase that is uniquely sensitive to inhibition by cell-permeable modified PP1 analog inhibitors while maintaining its ability to phosphorylate the same physiological substrates as the wild type (27Weiss E.L.

Because our small molecule inhibitors are designed only for analog-sensitive kinases, they have no effect on wild-type second messenger kinases such as PKA, calmodulin-dependent kinase, and tyrosine kinases, as well as other kinases implicated in GPCR regulation (29Niswender C.M.

In this study we specifically inhibit the kinase activity of GRK2 and investigate its role in morphine regulatory endocytosis of the μOR. In our efforts to create an analog-sensitive version of GRK2, based on a single point mutation in the ATP binding pocket, a significant loss of catalytic activity of the mutant kinase occurred. A sequence-based approach was developed for rescuing full enzymatic activity while still allowing for potent inhibition by an analog of PP1. To our knowledge, the present results are the first to develop a highly selective small molecule inhibitor for any member of the GRK family. By using this approach, we have identified an unexpected temporal function of μOR regulation by morphine. Inhibitor Synthesis—1Na-PP1 was synthesized as described previously (35Bishop A. Kung C. Shah K. Witucki L. Shokat K.M. Liu Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 627-631Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Plasmid Construction—Bovine GRK2 in pcDNA3.0 (a gift from J. Benovic) was used for transient cell expression. A carboxyl-terminal hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged version was constructed by cloning into pcDNA 3.1 and inserting a carboxyl-terminal HA tag (YPYDVPDYA) by standard site-directed mutagenesis. An amino-terminally His6-tagged GRK2, used for expression in baculovirus, was constructed using the Gateway and Bac-to-Bac systems (Invitrogen). Point mutations were introduced using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (QuickChange system, Stratagene). HA-tagged GRK2-as1 and GRK2-as5 were also cloned into PIRES hyg3 vector (Clontech) in order to generate hygromycin-resistant stably transfected cells. All cDNAs were verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. The amino-terminally FLAG-tagged murine μOR-1 (36Kaufman D.L. Xia Y.R. Keith Jr., D.E. Newman D. Evans C.J. Lusis A.J. Genomics. 1994; 19: 405-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), cloned into in pcDNA3.0, has been described previously (14Tsao P.I. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11130-11140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells (ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (University of California, San Francisco Cell Culture Facility). For studies of receptor trafficking in transiently transfected cells, cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and used for flow cytometry assay 48 h thereafter. Stably transfected cells expressing epitope-tagged μOR and GRK2 were generated by selection for neomycin resistance using 50 μg/ml G418 (Geneticin, Invitrogen) and hygromycin resistance using 200 μg/ml hygromycin (Roche Applied Science). Colonies representing individual neoR and hygroR clones were isolated and selected for further study based on receptor and GRK2 expression levels (assessed by fluorescence flow cytometry). Fluorescence Flow Cytometry—Internalization of epitope-tagged μOR was estimated by using fluorescence flow cytometry of μOR and GRK2 transient and stably transfected cells to measure changes in the relative amount of FLAG-tagged receptors present in the plasma membrane after surface labeling with Alexa488-conjugated M1 antibody as described previously (37Gage R.M. Kim K.A. Cao T.T. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44712-44720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Fluorescence flow cytometry was performed using a FACScan instrument (BD Biosciences). 10,000 cells were collected for each sample. Triplicate samples were analyzed for each condition in each experiment. The mean fluorescence values for each experiment (n = 3-5 experiments) were averaged, and the S.D. was calculated across all experiments. Fluorescence Microscopy—Endocytic trafficking of μOR initially labeled in the plasma membrane was visualized by fluorescence microscopy using a previously described “antibody feeding” method (38Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). For initial internalization experiments, stably transfected 293 cells expressing μOR and GRK2 were grown on glass coverslips (Corning Glass), and μOR was specifically labeled by incubating intact cells with M1 anti-FLAG antibody (2.0 μg/ml, Sigma) with or without 1Na-PP1 (2.5 μm). Surface-labeled μOR cells were subsequently incubated (at 37 °C for 30 min) in the presence of the appropriate opioid (10 μm morphine). Following this incubation, cells were fixed immediately in 4% formaldehyde freshly prepared in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) for 15 min and then quenched with three washes of Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.5), supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2. Specimens were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) in a blocking solution (3% dry milk in Tris-buffered saline plus 1 mm CaCl2) and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:500 dilution, Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 30 min to detect antibody-labeled receptors. For recycling and reinternalization experiments, μORs were specifically labeled by incubating intact cells with Alexa488 M1 anti-FLAG antibody (2.0 μg/ml, Sigma). Surface-labeled μOR cells were subsequently incubated (at 37 °C for 30 min) in the presence of morphine. Following this incubation, the M1 antibody was stripped using PBS/EDTA, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium applied along with Cy3 anti-mouse, opioid agonist or antagonist, and inhibitor. Cells were fixed immediately in 4% formaldehyde freshly prepared in PBS (pH 7.4) for 15 min and then quenched with three washes of Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.5) supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2. Epifluorescence microscopy was performed using an inverted microscope (Nikon Diaphot) equipped with a Nikon 60×NA1.4 objective and standard interference filter sets (Omega Optical). Images were collected using a 12-bit cooled charge-coupled device camera (Princeton Instruments) interfaced to a Macintosh computer running IPLab Spectrum software (Scanalytics). Purification of Recombinant GRK2—His6-tagged versions of wild-type and mutant GRK2 were overexpressed and purified from Sf9 cells using the baculovirus expression system as detailed previously (39Kim C.M. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J. Benovic J.L. Receptor. 1993; 3: 39-55PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested 72 h after infection by low speed centrifugation. Following homogenization in 50 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, and a protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science), a high speed supernatant was prepared. The soluble fraction was diluted and incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) for 1 h. The agarose was washed with 50 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole. GRK2 was eluted with 50 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole and stored at -80 °C in 30% glycerol under which the protein was stable for 2 months. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (40Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar) using purified bovine serum albumin as a standard. Purity of the GRK2 preparation was determined by Coomassie staining to be greater than 95%. Assay of GRK2 Activity—Phosphorylation reactions to determine the kinetics of ATP used tubulin (gift from R. Vale) as a substrate. Reactions contained 5 μm tubulin, 0.2 μm GRK2, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 2 mm EDTA, 7 mm MgCl2, and varying concentrations of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in a total volume of 20 μl. Incubations were at 23 °C for 30 min. Reactions to determine the kinetics of tubulin or rhodopsin were the same as above except using 0.025 μm GRK2, 700 μm [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and varying concentrations of tubulin or rhodopsin. Incubations were at 23 °C for 10 min. Phosphorylation reactions for inhibition of rhodopsin contained 400 nm rhodopsin (rod outer segments from Calbiochem), 75 nm GRK2, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 2 mm EDTA, 7 mm MgCl2, and 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in a total volume of 20 μl. Incubations were at 23 °C for 3 min under exposure to laboratory lighting. Reactions for tubulin and rhodopsin were quenched with SDS sample buffer and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Stoichiometry of phosphorylation was determined by PhosphorImager analysis (Amersham Biosciences). Design and Analysis of GRK2-as1—Through sequence alignment with other kinases, L271 in GRK2 was determined to be the gatekeeper residue, and this residue was mutated to glycine (L271G) (41Buzko O. Shokat K.M. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 1274-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To begin to assess the activity of GRK2 L271G (GRK2-as1) in intact HEK293 cells, we assessed the ability of the overexpressed kinase to promote morphine-induced internalization (24Zhang J. Ferguson S.S. Barak L.S. Bodduluri S.R. Laporte S.A. Law P.Y. Caron M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7157-7162Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 42Whistler J.L. von Zastrow M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9914-9919Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Morphine did not produce detectable μOR internalization in the absence of GRK2 overexpression, consistent with earlier reports (Fig. 1A). Receptor internalization was assessed by fluorescence microscopy, using anti-FLAG antibodies to detect FLAG-tagged μOR also expressed in HEK293 cells. The FLAG-μOR remained at the plasma membrane after incubation either in the absence or presence of a saturating concentration (10 μm) of morphine for 30 min in the absence of GRK2. When wild-type GRK2 was overexpressed, a pronounced redistribution of μOR from the plasma membrane to punctate intracellular vesicles occurred in response to morphine (Fig. 1A). This punctate pattern has been shown previously to reflect endocytosis of the μOR through clathrin-coated pits (24Zhang J. Ferguson S.S. Barak L.S. Bodduluri S.R. Laporte S.A. Law P.Y. Caron M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7157-7162Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 42Whistler J.L. von Zastrow M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 19021-19024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Comparison of GRK2 versus GRK2-as1-mediated μOR internalization revealed that overexpression of GRK2-as1 failed to induce morphine-dependent endocytosis, even in cells expressing this mutant kinase at high levels (as estimated by fluorescence staining intensity) relative to those at which wild-type GRK2 promoted morphine-induced endocytosis. In order to quantitate receptor internalization on a larger population of cells, we utilized flow cytometry. Flow cytometry was used to measure the level of FLAG-μOR cell surface fluorescence from 10,000 cells using Alexa488-conjugated anti-FLAG antibody both in the presence and absence of overexpressed GRK2 or GRK2-as1. The mean fluorescence intensity measured in agonist-treated cells was normalized to that measured in untreated cells in order to compute fractional internalization of receptors induced by agonist. In cells not overexpressing GRK2, morphine induced little (∼12%) μOR internalization (Fig. 1B). Overexpression of GRK2 produced substantially increased, morphine-induced μOR internalization (∼31%). Yet, overexpression of GRK2-as1 under similar conditions failed to promote morphine-induced internalization of receptors above the background produced by endogenous levels of GRK2, further suggesting GRK2-as1 is a severely compromised GRK2 allele. We analyzed internalization of the μOR in response to a second agonist, the peptide (enkephalin analog) DAMGO, by microscopy and flow cytometry when GRK2-as1 is expressed. DAMGO is a high affinity peptide agonist that, unlike morphine, is not dependent on the overexpression of GRK2 to induce internalization (43Keith D.E. Murray S.R. Zaki P.A. Chu P.C. Lissin D.V.

Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1636-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In cells overexpressing GRK2-as1, the μOR did internalize in response to DAMGO (Fig. 1B). This result suggests that the failure of GRK2-as1 to induce morphine-based internalization by the as allele is likely due to a lack of catalytic activity and not disruption of the endogenous endocytic machinery. To test this hypothesis directly, the catalytic activities of GRK2 and GRK2-as1 were assessed biochemically following purification, from a baculovirus expression system, and kinetic constants were determined for ATP using tubulin as a substrate (TABLE ONE) (39Kim C.M. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J. Benovic J.L. Receptor. 1993; 3: 39-55PubMed Google Scholar, 45Pitcher J.A. Hall R.A. Daaka Y. Zhang J. Ferguson S.S. Hester S. Miller S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Barak L.S. J.

The Km(ATP)app for purified GRK2-as1 was increased ∼4-fold relative to that of the wild-type GRK2. An increase in Km of this magnitude is typical for as kinases, since the gatekeeper mutation creates a larger ATP-binding site resulting in weaker ATP binding (30Bishop A.C. Ubersax J.A. Petsch D.T.

This change is unlikely to be physiologically significant because of the relatively high ATP concentration (∼1-5 mm) present in the cytoplasm (30Bishop A.C. Ubersax J.A. Petsch D.T. Matheos D.P.

More significantly, the kcat was sharply decreased, almost 30-fold, for GRK2-as1 relative to wild-type GRK2.TABLE ONEATP kinetic parameters of GRK2-mediated tubulin phosphorylation Kinase ATP Km kcat kcat/Km μm min−1 min−1 μm−1 GRK2 17 ± 5 0.174 ± 0.01 1.02 × 10−2 GRK2-as1 62 ± 24 0.006 ± 0.002 9.67 × 10−5 GRK2-as5 149 ± 42 0.246 ± 0.04 1.65 × 10−3 Open table in a new tab Second Site Mutations Restore Activity to GRK2-as1—This drastic decrease in catalytic activity is unusual as the corresponding gatekeeper mutation is tolerated by over 24 different kinases. However, in the cAMP-dependent kinase (PKA) family, although PKAα was able to tolerate the gatekeeper mutation, PKAβ had a profound decrease in activity (29Niswender C.M. Ishihara R.W. Judge L.M.

Because PKAα and PKAβ have a high degree of sequence conservation, sequence alignments were able to identify a small number of amino acids that differ between them. Rescue of catalytic activity of PKAβ was achieved by replacing the only nonconserved residue between PKAα and PKAβ. This residue is known as a second-site suppressor mutation. Because the L271G gatekeeper mutation in GRK2 also resulted in loss of catalytic activity, we investigated whether a similar sequence-based approach could also be applied to restor"

https://openalex.org/W1965998396,"Erythropoietin (Epo) is the primary regulator of erythropoiesis, controlling the proliferation, maturation, and survival of erythroid progenitor cells. The functions of Epo are mediated through its specific receptor (EpoR) expressed mainly on the surface of erythroid progenitor cells, and the expression of both responds to hypoxia. The subterranean mole rat (Spalax) is a unique model system to study the molecular mechanisms for adaptation to hypoxia. Here, we cloned two forms of Spalax EpoR: a complete EpoR cDNA as well as a novel truncated bone marrow specific EpoR form. In the full-length Spalax EpoR (sEpoR), two out of the eight conserved tyrosine- phosphorylation sites were substituted (Y481F and Y499G), suggesting that Spalax Epo signaling pathways may be modulated. The level of the sEpoR mRNA in the spleen and in bone marrow was relatively low and similar in Spalax newborns and adults, with no significant response to hypoxia. The truncated sEpoR was not detected in the spleen and comprised only approximately 1% of the sEpoR expressed in the bone marrow. In Rattus, the truncated EpoR form was approximately 15% of the total expressed receptor. The level of Rattus EpoR in newborn spleens was three- to fourfold higher than in Spalax newborns and decreased toward adulthood. Severe hypoxia induces a significant increase in adult Rattus EpoR. Our data provide further insight into the adaptive mechanisms of Spalax to the extreme conditions of hypoxia in its subterranean environment."

https://openalex.org/W2068353534,"Previous experiments with peptide fusion proteins suggested that cyclin A/Cdk1 and Cdk2 might exhibit similar yet distinct phosphorylation specificities. Using a physiological substrate, CDP/Cux, our study confirms this notion. Proteolytic processing of CDP/Cux by cathepsin L generates the CDP/Cux p110 isoform at the beginning of S phase. CDP/Cux p110 makes stable interactions with DNA during S phase but is inhibited in G2 following the phosphorylation of serine 1237 by cyclin A/Cdk1. In this study, we propose that differential phosphorylation by cyclin A/Cdk1 and cyclin A/Cdk2 enables CDP/Cux p110 to exert its function as a transcriptional regulator specifically during S phase. We found that like cyclin A/Cdk1, cyclin A/Cdk2 interacted efficiently with recombinant CDP/Cux proteins that contain the Cut homeodomain and an adjacent cyclin-binding motif (Cy). In contrast to cyclin A/Cdk1, however, cyclin A/Cdk2 did not efficiently phosphorylate CDP/Cux p110 on serine 1237 and did not inhibit its DNA binding activity in vitro. Accordingly, co-expression with cyclin A/Cdk2 in cells did not inhibit the DNA binding and transcriptional activities of CDP/Cux p110. To confirm that the sequence surrounding serine 1237 was responsible for the differential regulation by Cdk1 and Cdk2, we replaced 4 amino acids flanking the phosphorylation site to mimic a known Cdk2 phosphorylation site present in the Cdc6 protein. Both cyclin A/Cdk2 and Cdk1 efficiently phosphorylated the CDP/CuxCdc6 mutant and inhibited its DNA binding activity. Altogether our results help explain why the DNA binding activity of CDP/Cux p110 is maximal during S phase and decreases in G2 phase."
