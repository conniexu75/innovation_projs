https://openalex.org/W2952043149,"The increasing popularity of cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) DNA metabarcoding warrants a careful look at the underlying reference databases used to make high-throughput taxonomic assignments. The objectives of this study are to document trends and assess the future usability of COI records for metabarcode identification. The number of COI records deposited to the NCBI nucleotide database has increased by a geometric average of 51% per year, from 8,137 records deposited in 2003 to a cumulative total of ~ 2.5 million by the end of 2017. About half of these records are fully identified to the species rank, 92% are at least 500 bp in length, 74% have a country annotation, and 51% have latitude-longitude annotations. To ensure the future usability of COI records in GenBank we suggest: 1) Improving the geographic representation of COI records, 2) Improving the cross-referencing of COI records in the Barcode of Life Data System and GenBank to facilitate consolidation and incorporation into existing bioinformatic pipelines, 3) Adherence to the minimum information about a marker gene sequence guidelines, and 4) Integrating metabarcodes from eDNA and mixed community studies with existing reference sequences. The growth of COI reference records over the past 15 years has been substantial and is likely to be a resource across many fields for years to come."
https://openalex.org/W2891958637,"This study examined HIV testing and use, familiarity, and attitudes toward pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) among HIV-negative gay and bisexual men in the United States. A national probability sample (N = 470) of three age cohorts (18–25, 34–41, and 52–59 years) completed a survey between March, 2016 and March, 2017. Most men did not meet CDC recommendations for HIV testing, and 25.2% of men in the younger cohort had never tested. Only 4.1% used PrEP across cohorts. Visiting an LGBT clinic and searching for LGBT resources online were associated with PrEP use. Men in the middle cohort were more familiar with PrEP (79%) than men in the younger (52%) and older (57%) cohorts. Bisexual and non-urban men were less familiar with PrEP. Attitudes were positive among most men (68.4%) familiar with PrEP. Findings suggest that most men potentially at risk for HIV do not meet CDC guidelines for testing, and PrEP use continues to be minimal. Efforts to educate gay and bisexual men about HIV risk and prevention need to be reinvigorated and expanded to include non-gay-identified and non-urban men."
https://openalex.org/W2891992691,"Cell cycle regulation, especially faithful DNA replication and mitosis, are crucial to maintain genome stability. Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)/cyclin complexes drive most processes in cellular proliferation. In response to DNA damage, cell cycle surveillance mechanisms enable normal cells to arrest and undergo repair processes. Perturbations in genomic stability can lead to tumor development and suggest that cell cycle regulators could be effective targets in anticancer therapy. However, many clinical trials ended in failure due to off-target effects of the inhibitors used. Here, we investigate in vivo the importance of WEE1- and MYT1-dependent inhibitory phosphorylation of mammalian CDK1. We generated Cdk1AF knockin mice, in which two inhibitory phosphorylation sites are replaced by the non-phosphorylatable amino acids T14A/Y15F. We uncovered that monoallelic expression of CDK1AF is early embryonic lethal in mice and induces S phase arrest accompanied by γH2AX and DNA damage checkpoint activation in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). The chromosomal fragmentation in Cdk1AF MEFs does not rely on CDK2 and is partly caused by premature activation of MUS81-SLX4 structure-specific endonuclease complexes, as well as untimely onset of chromosome condensation followed by nuclear lamina disassembly. We provide evidence that tumor development in liver expressing CDK1AF is inhibited. Interestingly, the regulatory mechanisms that impede cell proliferation in CDK1AF expressing cells differ partially from the actions of the WEE1 inhibitor, MK-1775, with p53 expression determining the sensitivity of cells to the drug response. Thus, our work highlights the importance of improved therapeutic strategies for patients with various cancer types and may explain why some patients respond better to WEE1 inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2890135040,"Background Given the worldwide prevalence of NAFLD and NASH, there is a need to develop treatments to slow or reverse disease progression. GR-MD-02 (galactoarabino-rhamnogalaturonate) has been shown to reduce hepatic fibrosis in animal studies, and lower serum biomarkers of NASH fibrogenesis in humans. The primary aim of this study was to determine the difference between four-months of treatment with GR-MD-02 or placebo in liver inflammation and fibrosis as measured by iron-corrected T1 (cT1) mapping, a non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarker that correlates with the extent of hepatic fibro-inflammatory disease. The secondary aims were to determine change in liver stiffness as measured by magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) and shear-wave ultrasonic elastography (LSM), and to explore test-retest repeatability of the three biomarkers. Materials and methods Thirty subjects (13 females, 46–71 years) with NASH and advanced fibrosis were recruited. Subjects were randomized to receive 8 mg.kg-1 GR-MD-02 (via IV infusion) or placebo, administered biweekly over a 16-week period. Therapeutic efficacy was examined using cT1, MRE, and LSM. Statistical analyses on group differences in the biomarkers were performed using robust ANCOVA models adjusting for baseline measurement and additional covariates. Results There was no significant difference in cT1 (p = 0.16) between GR-MD-02 and placebo groups following a 16-week intervention. There was also no significant difference in liver stiffness, measured by MRE (p = 0.80) or LSM (p = 0.63), between groups. Examination of repeatability of the cT1, MRE and LSM revealed coefficient of variations of 3.1%, 11% and 40% respectively. Conclusions 8 mg.kg-1 of GR-MD-02 had no significant effect on non-invasive biomarkers of liver inflammation or fibrosis over a 4-month period. Histological confirmation was not available in this study. The high reproducibility of the primary outcome measure suggests that cT1 could be utilized for monitoring longitudinal change in patients with NASH."
https://openalex.org/W2890300091,"Considerable insight into effectors of cardiovascular function can be gleaned from controlled studies on mice, especially given the diverse models that are available. Toward this end, however, there is a need for consistent and complementary methods of in vivo and in vitro data analysis, synthesis, and interpretation. The overall objective of this study is twofold. First, we present new semi-automated methods to quantify in vivo measurements of vascular function in anesthetized mice as well as new approaches to synthesize these data with those from in vitro biaxial mechanical characterizations. Second, we contrast regional differences in biomechanical behaviors along the central vasculature by combining biaxial strains measured in vivo with data on the unloaded geometry and biaxial material properties measured in vitro. Results support the hypothesis that the healthy ascending aorta stores significant elastic energy during systole, which is available to work on the heart and blood during diastole, particularly during periods of physical exertion, and further suggest that perivascular tethering allows arteries to work at lower values of wall stress and material stiffness than often assumed. The numerous measurements of vascular function and properties provided herein can also serve as reference values for normal wild-type male and female mice, to which values for myriad genetic, surgical, and pharmacological models can be compared in future studies."
https://openalex.org/W2952438986,"The reliable and objective assessment of intelligence and personality has been a topic of increasing interest of contemporary neuroscience and psychology. It is known that intelligence can be measured by estimating the mental speed or velocity of information processing. This is usually measured as a reaction time during elementary cognitive task processing, while personality is often assessed by means of questionnaires. On the other hand, human personality affects the way a subject accomplishes elementary cognitive tasks and, therefore, some personality features can define intelligence. It is expected that these features, as well as mental abilities in performing cognitive tasks are associated with the brain’s electrical neural activity. Although several studies reported correlation between event-related potentials, mental ability and intelligence, there is a lack of information about time-frequency and spatio-temporal structures of neural activity which characterize this relation. In the present work, we analyzed human electroencephalograms (EEG) recorded during the performance of elementary cognitive tasks using the Schulte test, which is a paper-pencil based instrument for assessing elementary cognitive ability or mental speed. According to particular features found of the EEG structure, we divided the subjects into three groups. For subjects in each group, we applied the Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire (16PF) to assess the their personality traits. We demonstrated that each group exhibited a different score on the personality scale, such as warmth, reasoning, emotional stability and dominance. Summing up, we found a link between EEG features, mental abilities and personality traits. The obtained results can be of great interest for testing human personality to create automatized intelligent programs which combine simple tests and EEG measurements for real estimation of human personality traits and mental abilities."
https://openalex.org/W2890890215,"Introduction Micro- or nano-topography can both provide antimicrobial properties and improve osseointegration of dental implant titanium surfaces. Laser treatment is one of the best surface microtexturing techniques. The aim of this study was to evaluate in vitro and in situ biofilm formation on a laser-treated titanium surface, comparing it with two conventional surfaces, machined and grit-blasted. Methods For the in vitro experiment, an oral microcosm biofilm model was developed on the surface of titanium disks and reference human enamel using a bioreactor for 48 h. For the in situ experiment, titanium implants with laser-treated, machined and grit-blasted surfaces were mounted on intraoral trays and worn by ten volunteers for 48 h. Biofilm formation was quantitatively evaluated, and surfaces were analyzed using confocal laser scanning microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Results–in vitro study Biofilm structures with a prevalence of viable cells covered most of the machined, grit-blasted and human enamel surfaces, whereas less dense biofilm structures with non-confluent microcolonies were observed on the laser-treated titanium. Laser-treated titanium showed the lowest biofilm formation, where microorganisms colonized the edges of the laser-created pits, with very few or no biofilm formation observed inside the pits. Results–in situ study The biofilm formation pattern observed was similar to that in the in vitro experiment. Confocal laser scanning microscopy showed complete coverage of the implant threads, with mostly viable cells in grit-blasted and machined specimens. Unexpectedly, laser-treated specimens showed few dead microbial cells colonizing the bottom of the threads, while an intense colonization was found on the threading sides. Conclusion This data suggests that laser-created microtopography can reduce biofilm formation, with a maximum effect when the surface is blasted orthogonally by the laser beam. In this sense the orientation of the laser beam seems to be relevant for the biological interaction with biofilms."
https://openalex.org/W2891409687,"Background Increases in pneumococcal meningitis were reported from Ghanaian regions that lie in the meningitis belt in 2016–2017, despite introduction of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) in 2012 using a 3-dose schedule (6, 10, and 14 weeks). We describe pneumococcal meningitis epidemiology in the Ghanaian Northern and Upper West regions across two meningitis seasons. Methods Suspected meningitis cases were identified using World Health Organization standard definitions. Pneumococcal meningitis was confirmed if pneumococcus was the sole pathogen detected by polymerase chain reaction, culture, or latex agglutination in cerebrospinal fluid collected from a person with suspected meningitis during December 2015-March 2017. Pneumococcal serotyping was done using PCR. Annual age-specific pneumococcal meningitis incidence (cases per 100,000 population) was calculated, adjusting for suspected meningitis cases lacking confirmatory testing. Findings Among 153 pneumococcal meningitis cases, 137 (89.5%) were serotyped; 100 (73.0%) were PCV13-type, including 85 (62.0%) that were serotype 1, a PCV13-targeted serotype. Persons aged ≥5 years accounted for 96.7% (148/153) of cases. Comparing 2015–2016 and 2016–2017 seasons, the proportion of non-serotype 1 PCV13-type cases decreased from 20.0% (9/45) to 4.1% (3/74) (p = 0.008), whereas the proportion that was serotype 1 was stable (71.1% (32/45) vs. 58.1% (43/74); p = 0.16). Estimated adjusted pneumococcal meningitis incidence was 1.8 in children aged <5 years and ranged from 6.8–10.5 in older children and adults. Conclusions High pneumococcal meningitis incidence with a large proportion of serotype 1 disease in older children and adults suggests infant PCV13 vaccination has not induced herd protection with this schedule in this high-transmission setting."
https://openalex.org/W2890767889,"Introduction The EXIST-2 (NCT00790400) study demonstrated the superiority of everolimus over placebo for the treatment of renal angiomyolipomas associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) or sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM). This post hoc analysis of EXIST-2 study aimed to assess angiomyolipoma tumor behavior among patients who submitted to continued radiographic examination following discontinuation of everolimus in the noninterventional follow-up phase. Methods For patients who discontinued everolimus at the completion of extension phase for reasons other than angiomyolipoma progression, a single CT/MRI scan of the kidney was collected after 1 year of treatment discontinuation. Changes from baseline and from the time of everolimus discontinuation in the sum of volumes of target angiomyolipoma lesions were assessed in the non-interventional follow-up phase (data cutoff date, November 6, 2015). Results Of the 112 patients who received ≥1 dose of everolimus and discontinued treatment by the end of extension phase, 34 (30.4%) were eligible for participation in the non-interventional follow-up phase. Sixteen of 34 patients were evaluable for angiomyolipoma tumor behavior as they had at least one valid efficacy assessment (i.e. kidney CT/MRI scan) after everolimus discontinuation. During the non-interventional follow-up phase, compared with baseline, two patients (12.5%) experienced angiomyolipoma progression (angiomyolipoma-related bleeding [n = 1], increased kidney volume [n = 1]). Five patients out of 16 (31.3%) experienced angiomyolipoma progression when compared with the angiomyolipoma tumor assessment at everolimus discontinuation. The median (range) percentage change in angiomyolipoma tumor volume (cm3) from baseline was −70.56 (−88.30; −49.64) at time of everolimus discontinuation (n = 11), and −50.55 (−79.40; −23.16) at week 48 (n = 7) after discontinuation of everolimus. One patient death was reported due to angiomyolipoma hemorrhage. Conclusions Angiomyolipoma lesions displayed an increase in volume following discontinuation of everolimus in patients with renal angiomyolipoma or sporadic LAM associated with TSC, but there was no evidence of rapid regrowth.

https://openalex.org/W2890787000,"Lysophosphatidate (LPA) signaling through 6 receptors is regulated by the balance of LPA production by autotaxin (ATX) vs. LPA degradation by lipid phosphate phosphatases (LPPs). LPA promotes an inflammatory cycle by increasing the synthesis of cyclooxygenase-2 and multiple inflammatory cytokines that stimulate further ATX production. We aimed to determine whether the anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid (GC) dexamethasone (Dex) functions partly by decreasing the ATX–LPA inflammatory cycle in adipose tissue, a major site of ATX secretion. Treatment of human adipose tissue with 10–1000 nM Dex decreased ATX secretion, increased LPP1 expression, and decreased mRNA expressions of IL-6, TNF-α, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ, and adiponectin. Cotreatment with rosiglitazone (an insulin sensitizer), insulin, or both abolished Dex-induced decreases in ATX and adiponectin secretion, but did not reverse Dex-induced decreases in secretions of 20 inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Dex-treated mice exhibited lower ATX activity in plasma, brain, and adipose tissue; decreased mRNA levels for LPA and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptors in brain; and decreased plasma concentrations of LPA and S1P. Our results establish a novel mechanism for the anti-inflammatory effects of Dex through decreased signaling by the ATX-LPA-inflammatory axis.

https://openalex.org/W2891455686,"The wild species of chickpea have tremendous potential for enhancing genetic gains of cultigen and have resistant accessions against major biotic and abiotic stresses. In the present study, two wild annual accessions, one each of C. reticulatum Ladiz. (ILWC 229) and C. echinospermum Davis (ILWC 246) were assessed for their agro-morphological features and hybridized with different cultivated varieties (BGD 72, PBG 5, ICKG 96029, Pusa 372 and JG 11) of chickpea. Fertile F1 plants were developed as revealed by their normal meiotic chromosomal configuration including high pollen stainability percentage and seed set. The effect of genetic and non-genetic factors on crossability performance with respect to pod and seed set was also evident under two growing conditions of North-Western Indian Himalayas. The segregation analysis using F2 phenotypic ratio of some distinct morphological (plant growth habit, stem pigmentation at seedling stage and testa texture) characters indicated their monogenic inheritance pattern. The study would also be useful to chickpea breeders to identify true to type interspecific plants. Further, the F1, F2 and F3 generations of all seven crosses along with parents were evaluated under natural field condition to determine the extent of variability created into the cultivated background of chickpea. There was a wide range of variation in F3 population against cold stress, suggesting selection of tolerant recombinant lines at an early stage. We also studied fruitful heterosis (%) as a useful approach, instead of residual heterosis to identify better performing transgressive segregants. The values of most of the interspecific crosses for important traits assessed in F2 and F3 generations were higher than that of better parent, suggesting isolation of inbred vigour for pod numbers and earliness. The results indicated that wild Cicer annual accessions of C. reticulatum and C. echinospermum species can be exploited after proper screening for traits of interest for diversification of cultivated gene pool and subsequent use in chickpea improvement."
https://openalex.org/W2890571627,"Lipids play very important roles in lung biology, mainly reducing the alveolar surface tension at the air-liquid interface thereby preventing end-expiratory collapse of the alveoli. In the present study we performed an extensive quantitative lipidomic analysis of mouse lung to provide the i) total lipid quantity, ii) distribution pattern of the major lipid classes, iii) composition of individual lipid species and iv) glycerophospholipid distribution pattern according to carbon chain length (total number of carbon atoms) and degree of unsaturation (total number of double bonds). We analysed and quantified 160 glycerophospholipid species, 24 sphingolipid species, 18 cholesteryl esters and cholesterol from lungs of a) newborn (P1), b) 15-day-old (P15) and c) 12-week-old adult mice (P84) to understand the changes occurring during postnatal pulmonary development. Our results revealed an increase in total lipid quantity, correlation of lipid class distribution in lung tissue and significant changes in the individual lipid species composition during postnatal lung development. Interestingly, we observed significant stage-specific alterations during this process. Especially, P1 lungs showed high content of monounsaturated lipid species; P15 lungs exhibited myristic and palmitic acid containing lipid species, whereas adult lungs were enriched with polyunsaturated lipid species. Taken together, our study provides an extensive quantitative lipidome of the postnatal mouse lung development, which may serve as a reference for a better understanding of lipid alterations and their functions in lung development and respiratory diseases associated with lipids."
https://openalex.org/W2889685549,"The goal of this study is to explore eye movement recordings during the Developmental Eye Movement (DEM) test in dyslexic and non-dyslexic children. Thirteen children with dyslexia, 13 non-dyslexic chronological age- and IQ-matched children and 13 non-dyslexic reading age- and IQ-matched children were examined. Test C of the DEM test was performed with and without eye movement recordings (eye tracker by SuriCog). The results of the three groups were compared. Children with dyslexia and non-dyslexic children of equivalent reading age have significant longer fixation time and take longer to read Test C of the DEM test than non-dyslexic children of similar chronological age. A significant correlation was also found between the fixation time and the number of words read in one minute with the total time to read Test C of the DEM test. DEM test is a useful test for exploring the oculomotor behavior of dyslexic children during reading. The maturation of cortical structures controlling fixation capability appears to play a crucial role in reading skills."
https://openalex.org/W2890800666,"Tooth agenesis is one of the most common craniofacial disorders in humans. More than 350 genes have been associated with teeth development. In this study, we enrolled 60 child patients (age 13 to 17) with various types of tooth agenesis. Whole gene sequences of PAX9, MSX1, AXIN2, EDA, EDAR and WNT10a genes were sequenced by next generation sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform. We found previously undescribed heterozygous nonsense mutation g.8177G>T (c.610G>T) in MSX1 gene in one child. Mutation was verified by Sanger sequencing. Sequencing analysis was performed in other family members of the affected child. All family members carrying g.8177G>T mutation suffered from oligodontia (missing more than 6 teeth excluding third molars). Mutation g.8177G>T leads to a stop codon (p.E204X) and premature termination of Msx1 protein translation. Based on previous in vitro experiments on mutation disrupting function of Msx1 homeodomain, we assume that the heterozygous g.8177G>T nonsense mutation affects the amount and function of Msx1 protein and leads to tooth agenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2892045433,"Seasonal influenza virus infections cause yearly epidemics which are the source of a significant public health burden worldwide. The ferret model for human influenza A virus (IAV) is widely used and has several advantages over other animal models such as comparable symptomology, similar receptor distribution in the respiratory tract to humans and the ability to be infected with human isolates without the need for adaptation. However, a major disadvantage of the model has been a paucity of reagents for the evaluation of the cellular immune response. Investigation of T-cell mediated immunity in ferrets is crucial to vaccine development and efficacy studies. In this study we have used commercially produced antibodies to ferret interferon gamma (IFN-γ) allowing us to reliably measure influenza-specific IFN-γ as a marker of the cellular immune response using both enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) techniques. Here we demonstrate the application of these tools to evaluate cellular immunity in ferrets infected with clinically relevant seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 IAV subtypes at equivalent doses. Using small heparinised blood samples we were able to observe the longitudinal influenza-specific IFN-γ responses of ferrets infected with both seasonal subtypes of IAV and found a notable increase in influenza-specific IFN-γ responses in circulating peripheral blood within 8 days post-infection. Both seasonal strains caused a well-defined pattern of influenza-specific IFN-γ responses in infected ferrets when compared to naïve animals. Additionally, we found that while the influenza specific IFN-γ responses found in peripheral circulating blood were comparable between subtypes, the influenza specific IFN-γ responses found in lung lymphocytes significantly differed. Our results suggest that there is a distinct difference between the ability of the two seasonal influenza strains to establish an infection in the lung of ferrets associated with distinct signatures of acquired immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2949480790,"Allochthonous detritus of terrestrial origin is one of the main energy sources in forested headwater streams, but its poor nutritional quality makes it difficult to use by heterotrophs. It has been suggested that algae growing on this detritus can enhance its nutritional quality and promote decomposition. So far, most evidence of this ""priming effect” is derived from laboratory or mesocosm experiments, and its importance under natural conditions is unclear. We measured accrual of algae, phosphorus uptake capacity, and decomposition of poplar leaves in autumn in open- and closed-canopy reaches in 3 forest and 3 agricultural streams. Chlorophyll a abundance did not change significantly with stream type or with canopy cover, although in some agricultural streams it was higher in open than in closed canopy reaches. Canopy cover did not affect either phosphate uptake capacity or microbial decomposition. On the other hand, although there was no effect of canopy cover on invertebrate fragmentation rate, a significant interaction between canopy cover and stream suggests priming occurs at least in some streams. Overall, the results point to a weak or no priming effect of algae on litter decomposition in natural streams during autumn."
https://openalex.org/W2890973509,"Background Young children are susceptible to enterovirus (EV) infections, which cause significant morbidity in this age group. However, the current knowledge regarding the epidemiology of EVs and the circulating virus strains is mostly based on viruses detected in children with severe diseases leading to contact with the health care system, while the vast reservoir of EVs that circulate in the general population is less characterized. Methodology The present study investigates the types and the prevalence of EVs circulating in the young children of the background population in Georgia, Colorado, and Washington State in the USA, and Germany, Sweden, and Finland in Europe. A total of 4018 stool samples, collected monthly from 300 healthy and non-hospitalized children at the age of 3–18 months in 2005–2009, were analyzed for the presence of EVs using RT-PCR, followed by sequencing of the VP1-2A region of the viral genome to type the EV(s) present. All of the children carried type HLA-DQ2 or -DQ8 alleles associated with type 1 diabetes. Principal findings Altogether 201 children (67%) were found to be EV positive. The prevalence was much lower in Finnish children (26%) than in the children of the other counties combined (75%). Infections increased by age and showed a nadir during the winter months. Children who carried both the HLA-DQ2 and -DQ8 alleles had less infections than children who were homozygous for these alleles. Coxsackieviruses type A were the most frequently detected viruses in all geographical regions. Coxsackievirus type A4, Echovirus type 18, and Echovirus type 25 were shed for longer time periods than the other EV types. Conclusions Compared to prevalence data from symptomatic patients requiring medical attention, this study provides a better view of EVs circulating in young children in the USA and in Europe. The observations may prove useful for the selection of strategies for designing EV vaccines in the future. The study also confirms our previous serological findings suggesting that EV infections are relatively rare in Finland."
https://openalex.org/W2891087112,"Phylogenetic trees of spider mites were previously obtained using 18S and 28S rRNA genes. Because some of the bootstrap values were relatively low, these trees were unable to completely resolve the phylogeny. Here, we obtained RNA-Seq data for the 72 known species (73 strains) of spider mites to analyze the phylogeny of the sub-family Tetranychinae. The data were de novo assembled into a total alignment length of 790,047 bases corresponding to 264,133 amino acid residues in 652 genes. The sequence dataset was 200 times larger than the data used in the previous study. The new trees were much more robust and more clearly defined the clades of the tribes and the genera of the sub-family Tetranychinae. The tribe Tetranychini was polyphyletic because a monophyletic clade of Eurytetranychini was placed inside it. The six genera from which two or more species were sampled appeared to be monophyletic, but four genera (Schizotetranychus, Eotetranychus, Oligonychus and Tetranychus) appeared to be polyphyletic. These results strongly support the previous molecular inference of the polyphyletic tribes and genera, although the molecular phylogeny of the sub-family Tetranychinae does not fully agree with the current morphology-based taxonomy. The taxonomy of the sub-family Tetranychinae should be revised according to the molecular relationships revealed by this study."
https://openalex.org/W2891155065,"Background Convergence of tuberculosis (TB) and HIV epidemics is associated with higher morbidity and mortality risks and understanding their distribution across key demographic factors is essential for prevention and control. This analysis examines the prevalence of TB, HIV and TB-HIV coinfection across age and gender in patients with presumptive TB seeking care at the National TB and Leprosy Training Center in Nigeria. Methods Samples from 1603 presumptive pulmonary TB cases who provided informed consent were evaluated with a sequential testing algorithm that included a smear microscopy, cultures in liquid and broth media and then genotyping by Hain line probe assays. HIV was serially tested with two HIV rapid assays and retested with a third assay in non-conclusive samples. Results Twenty-three percent (375/1603) had confirmed pulmonary TB infection, 23.6% (378/1603) were positive for HIV infection and 26.9% (101/375) of the confirmed TB cases were HIV co-infected. Males had a higher prevalence of TB: 27.6% vs. 18.0%, p < .0001; and a lower prevalence of HIV: 19.0% vs. 29.6%, p < .0001. In the age range of 25–29 years, males were twice as likely to have TB (OR = 2.2; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3–3.9, p = 0.0032) while females were five times more likely to have HIV (OR = 4.8; 95% CI: 2.6–8.9, p < .0001). Persons with TB-HIV coinfection were more likely to be young, female and less likely to be married. Conclusion Younger females with a high burden of HIV may be under-diagnosed and under-reported for TB in Nigeria. Community programs for intensified and early detection of TB and HIV targeting younger females are needed in this setting."
https://openalex.org/W2890338676,"Effective supportive supervision of healthcare services is crucial for improving and maintaining quality of care. However, this process can be challenging in an environment with chronic shortage of qualified human resources, overburdened healthcare providers, multiple roles of district managers, weak supply chains, high donor fragmentation and inefficient allocation of limited financial resources. Operating in this environment, we systematically evaluated an approach developed in Tanzania to strengthen the implementation of routine supportive supervision of primary healthcare providers. The approach included a systematic quality assessment at health facilities using an electronic tool and subsequent result dissemination at council level. Mixed methods were used to compare the new supportive supervision approach with routine supportive supervision. Qualitative data was collected through in-depth interviews in three councils. Observational data and informal communication as well as secondary data complemented the data set. Additionally, an economic costing analysis was carried out in the same councils. Compared to routine supportive supervision, the new approach increased healthcare providers' knowledge and skills, as well as quality of data collected and acceptance of supportive supervision amongst stakeholders involved. It also ensured better availability of evidence for follow-up actions, including budgeting and planning, and higher stakeholder motivation and ownership of subsequent quality improvement measures. The new approach reduced time and cost spent during supportive supervision. This increased feasibility of supportive supervision and hence the likelihood of its implementation. Thus, the results presented together with previous findings suggested that if used as the standard approach for routine supportive supervision the new approach offers a suitable option to make supportive supervision more efficient and effective and therewith more sustainable. Moreover, the new approach also provides informed guidance to overcome several problems of supportive supervision and healthcare quality assessments in low- and middle income countries."
https://openalex.org/W2890157392,"Many vaccines require adjuvants to enhance immunogenicity, but there are few safe and effective intradermal (i.d.) adjuvants. Murine studies have validated the potency of laser illumination of skin as an adjuvant for i.d. vaccination with advantages over traditional adjuvants. We report a pilot clinical trial of low-power, continuous-wave, near-infrared laser adjuvant treatment, representing the first human trial of the safety, tolerability, and cutaneous immune cell trafficking changes produced by the laser adjuvant. In this trial we demonstrated a maximum tolerable energy dose of 300 J/cm2 to a spot on the lower back. The irradiated spot was biopsied 4 h later, as was a control spot. Paired biopsies were submitted for histomorphologic and immunohistochemical evaluation in a blinded fashion as well as quantitative PCR analysis for chemokines and cytokines. Similar to prior murine studies, highly significant reductions in CD1a+ Langerhans cells in the dermis and CD11c+ dermal dendritic cells were observed, corresponding to the increased migratory activity of these cells; changes in the epidermis were not significant. There was no evidence of skin damage. The laser adjuvant is a safe, well-tolerated adjuvant for i.d. vaccination in humans and results in significant cutaneous immune cell trafficking.-Gelfand, J.

https://openalex.org/W2890297374,"The study aimed at evaluating the effects of combined aerobic and resistance exercise training on cardiac morphometry and function, oxidative stress and inflammatory parameters in diabetic ovariectomized rats. For this, female Wistar rats (10 weeks-old) were divided into 4 groups (n = 8): euglycemic (E), diabetic (streptozotocin, 50 mg/kg, iv) (D), diabetic ovariectomized (DO) and trained diabetic ovariectomized (TDO). The combined exercise training was performed on a treadmill and in a ladder adapted to rats (8 weeks, at 40-60% of maximal capacity). The left ventricle (LV) morphometry and function were evaluated by echocardiography. Oxidative stress and inflammatory markers were measured on ventricles tissue. The sedentary diabetic animals (D and DO) showed impaired systolic and diastolic functions, as well as increased cardiac overload, evaluated by myocardial performance index (MPI- D: 0.32 ± 0.05; DO: 0.39 ± 0.13 vs. E: 0.25 ± 0.07), in relation to E group. Systolic and MPI dysfunctions were exacerbated in DO when compared to D group. The DO group presented higher protein oxidation and TNF-α/IL-10 ratio than D groups. Glutathione redox ratio (GSH/GSSG) and IL-10 were decreased in both D and DO groups when compared to E group. Exercise training improved exercise capacity, systolic and diastolic functions and MPI (0.18±0.11). The TDO group showed reduced protein oxidation and TNF-α/IL-10 ratio and increased GSH/GSSG and IL-10 in relation to the DO group. These results showed that combined exercise training was able to attenuate the cardiac dysfunctions, probably by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress in an experimental model of diabetes and menopause."
https://openalex.org/W2892240327,"Speech motor actions are performed quickly, while simultaneously maintaining a high degree of accuracy. Are speed and accuracy in conflict during speech production? Speed-accuracy tradeoffs have been shown in many domains of human motor action, but have not been directly examined in the domain of speech production. The present work seeks evidence for Fitts’ law, a rigorous formulation of this fundamental tradeoff, in speech articulation kinematics by analyzing USC-TIMIT, a real-time magnetic resonance imaging data set of speech production. A theoretical framework for considering Fitts’ law with respect to models of speech motor control is elucidated. Methodological challenges in seeking relationships consistent with Fitts’ law are addressed, including the operational definitions and measurement of key variables in real-time MRI data. Results suggest the presence of speed-accuracy tradeoffs for certain types of speech production actions, with wide variability across syllable position, and substantial variability also across subjects. Coda consonant targets immediately following the syllabic nucleus show the strongest evidence of this tradeoff, with correlations as high as 0.72 between speed and accuracy. A discussion is provided concerning the potentially limited applicability of Fitts’ law in the context of speech production, as well as the theoretical context for interpreting the results."
https://openalex.org/W2890035832,"Objectives Follow-up studies suggest that the psychosocial impact of pediatric cancer on parents often extends beyond the end of their child’s cancer treatments, and parents can continue to experience both individual and relationship effects. In a long-term study of parents of children who were treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), we aimed to: 1) describe parents’ adjustment (psychological distress, relationship satisfaction; 2) describe the perceived impact of cancer on couples’ relationship, and; 3) identify to what extent the perceived impact of cancer on the couple is related to both parents’ long-term adjustment. Methods Parents of childhood ALL survivors (n = 103 couples) were surveyed as part of a cohort recall (PETALE cohort). Both parents completed questionnaires exploring adjustment (Brief Symptom Inventory-18, Dyadic Adjustment Scale) and perceived impact of cancer on the relationship (Impact of Cancer on the Couple). Mothers’ and fathers’ scores were compared using MANOVAs. We also examined the degree to which a parent’s perceived changes in relationship dynamics following their child’s cancer were associated with their own current adjustment (actor effects), and their partner’s current adjustment (partner effects) using the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model (APIM). Results Frequencies of current distress were normative in parents (mothers/fathers): general distress (6.8/7.8%), anxiety (5.8/6.8%), depression (2.9/6.8%), somatization (13.6/9.7%), and relationship distress (21.4/20.4%). Mothers and fathers typically agreed on their reported relationship satisfaction, and the perceived nature of relationship changes following the illness. Dyadic analyses indicated that whereas mothers’ adjustment was related to their own perceived relationship changes, fathers’ adjustment was primarily related to their partner’s perceptions. Conclusion In long-term stable couples, mothers may act as an influential bridge connecting the illness experiences of survivors and fathers. This could explain why mothers’ perceptions of relationship changes were related to their partners’ long-term adjustment, which was not the case for fathers."
https://openalex.org/W2890920579,"In many parts of the world, the combined effects of habitat fragmentation and altered disturbance regimes pose a significant threat to biodiversity. This is particularly true in Mediterranean-type ecosystems (MTEs), which tend to be fire-prone, species rich, and heavily impacted by human land use. Given the spatial complexity of overlapping threats and species' vulnerability along with limited conservation budgets, methods are needed for prioritizing areas for monitoring and management in these regions. We developed a multi-criteria Pareto ranking methodology for prioritizing spatial units for conservation and applied it to fire threat, habitat fragmentation threat, species richness, and genetic biodiversity criteria in San Diego County, California, USA. We summarized the criteria and Pareto ranking results (from west to east) within the maritime, coastal, transitional, inland climate zones within San Diego County. Fire threat increased from the maritime zone eastward to the transitional zone, then decreased in the mountainous inland climate zone. Number of fires and fire return interval departure were strongly negatively correlated. Fragmentation threats, particularly road density and development density, were highest in the maritime climate zone, declined towards the east, and were positively correlated. Species richness criteria showed distributions among climate zones similar to those of the fire threat variables. When using species richness and fire threat criteria, most lower-ranked (higher conservation priority) units occurred in the coastal and transitional zones. When considering genetic biodiversity, lower-ranked units occurred more often in the mountainous inland zone. With Pareto ranking, there is no need to select criteria weights as part of the decision-making process. However, negative correlations and larger numbers of criteria can result in more units assigned to the same rank. Pareto ranking is broadly applicable and can be used as a standalone decision analysis method or in conjunction with other methods."
https://openalex.org/W2890269197,"Background and aims The predictive value of traditional risk factors for vascular events in patients with manifest vascular disease is limited, underscoring the need for novel biomarkers to improve risk stratification. Since hematological parameters are routinely assessed in clinical practice, they are readily available candidates. Methods We used data from 3,922 vascular patients, who participated in the Second Manifestations of ARTerial Disease (SMART) study. We first investigated associations between recurrent vascular events and 22 hematological parameters, obtained from the Utrecht Patient Oriented Database (UPOD), and then assessed whether parameters associated with outcome improved risk prediction. Results After adjustment for all SMART risk score (SRS) variables, lymphocyte %, neutrophil count, neutrophil % and red cell distribution width (RDW) were significantly associated with vascular events. When individually added to the SRS, lymphocyte % improved prediction of recurrent vascular events with a continuous net reclassification improvement (cNRI) of 17.4% [95% CI: 2.1, 32.1%] and an increase in c-statistic of 0.011 [0.000, 0.022]. The combination of lymphocyte % and neutrophil count resulted in a cNRI of 22.2% [3.2, 33.4%] and improved c-statistic by 0.011 [95% CI: 0.000, 0.022]. Lymphocyte % and RDW yielded a cNRI of 18.7% [3.3, 31.9%] and improved c-statistic by 0.016 [0.004, 0.028]. However, the addition of hematological parameters only modestly increased risk estimates for patients with an event during follow-up. Conclusions Several hematological parameters were independently associated with recurrent vascular events. Lymphocyte % alone and in combination with other parameters enhanced discrimination and reclassification. However, the incremental value for patients with a recurrent event was limited."
https://openalex.org/W2891094547,"Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) is one of the principal staple for millions of people in sub-Saharan Africa serving as the main sources of protein. However, protein digestibility is low in sorghum and this may be affected by processing methods. In this study 15 sorghum cultivars and one variety each of maize (Zea maize) and tef (Eragrostis tef) all of Ethiopian origin were investigated for in-vitro protein digestibility (IVPD), activity and concentration of anti-nutritional factors and micro nutrient profile in raw flour and various cooked food samples. Kafirin composition content and composition was also determined from raw flour samples of the sorghum cultivars. IVPD was significantly different between genotypes with both maize and tef superior to sorghum both in cooked and uncooked state except for the high lysine genotype Wetet Be-gunchie. Cooking significantly reduced IVPD in all crops but had only minor effect in maize. Results revealed a highly significant interaction between genotype and food processing methods where, occasionally, genotypes with highest IVPD under one processing method ended up to be the lowest under another. Trypsin inhibitor levels had a significant and negative correlation with IVPD (r2 = 0.1), while changes in phytic acid concentration and intrinsic phytase levels during processing followed opposite trends to each other. Processing increased mineral levels by 20–44% for iron and 4–29% for zinc perhaps due to degradation of phytic acid. Results demonstrated that protein digestibility and the concentration of anti- nutritional factors varied widely depending on the food type. Identification of specific genotypes for a specific food product may help improve the nutritional quality of sorghum based foods."
https://openalex.org/W2953372619,"Dengue virus (DENV), an arthropod-borne (""arbovirus"") virus, causes a range of human maladies ranging from self-limiting dengue fever to the life-threatening dengue shock syndrome and proliferates well in two different taxa of the Animal Kingdom, mosquitoes and primates. Mosquitoes and primates show taxonomic group-specific intolerance to certain codon pairs when expressing their genes by translation. This is called ""codon pair bias"". By necessity, dengue viruses evolved to delicately balance this fundamental difference in their open reading frames (ORFs). We have undone the evolutionarily conserved genomic balance in the DENV2 ORF sequence and specifically shifted the encoding preference away from primates. However, this recoding of DENV2 raised concerns of 'gain-of-function,' namely whether recoding could inadvertently increase fitness for replication in the arthropod vector. Using mosquito cell lines and two strains of Aedes aegypti we did not observe any increase in fitness in DENV2 variants codon pair deoptimized for humans. This ability to disrupt and control DENV2's host preference has great promise towards developing the next generation of synthetic vaccines not only for DENV but for other emerging arboviral pathogens such as chikungunya virus and Zika virus."
https://openalex.org/W2889747924,"Long-term, interdisciplinary studies of relations between climate and ecological conditions on wetland-upland landscapes have been lacking, especially studies integrated across scales meaningful for adaptive resource management. We collected data in situ at individual wetlands, and via satellite for surrounding 4-km2 landscape blocks, to assess relations between annual weather dynamics, snow duration, phenology, wetland surface-water availability, amphibian presence and calling activity, greenness, and evapotranspiration in four U.S. conservation areas from 2008 to 2012. Amid recent decades of relatively warm growing seasons, 2012 and 2010 were the first and second warmest seasons, respectively, dating back to 1895. Accordingly, we observed the earliest starts of springtime biological activity during those two years. In all years, early-season amphibians first called soon after daily mean air temperatures were ≥ 0°C and snow had mostly melted. Similarly, satellite-based indicators suggested seasonal leaf-out happened soon after snowmelt and temperature thresholds for plant growth had occurred. Daily fluctuations in weather and water levels were related to amphibian calling activity, including decoupling the timing of the onset of calling at the start of season from the onset of calling events later in the season. Within-season variation in temperature and precipitation also was related to vegetation greenness and evapotranspiration, but more at monthly and seasonal scales. Wetland water levels were moderately to strongly associated with precipitation and early or intermittent wetland drying likely reduced amphibian reproduction success in some years, even though Pseudacris crucifer occupied sites at consistently high levels. Notably, satellite-based indicators of landscape water availability did not suggest such consequential, intra-seasonal variability in wetland surface-water availability. Our cross-disciplinary data show how temperature and precipitation interacted to affect key ecological relations and outcomes on our study landscapes. These results demonstrate the value of multi-year studies and the importance of scale for understanding actual climate-related effects in these areas."
https://openalex.org/W2889958846,"Purpose To perform in vitro high-resolution 900 MHz magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) analysis of human brain tumor tissue extracts and analyze for the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) and other brain metabolites, not only for 1H but also for 13C with indirect detection by heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC). Material and methods Four surgically removed human brain tumor tissue samples were used for extraction and preparation of NMR samples. These tissue samples were extracted with 4% perchloric acid and chloroform, freeze-dried, then dissolved into 0.28 mL of deuterium oxide (D2O, 99.9 atom % deuterium) containing 0.025 wt % sodium 3-(trimethylsilyl)propionate-2,2,3,3-d4 (TSP). All samples were adjusted to pH range of 6.9–7.1 before finally transferred to 5 mm Shigemi™ NMR microtube. NMR experiments were performed on Bruker DRX 900 MHz spectrometer with 1H/13C/15N Cryo-probe™ with Z-gradient, without further temperature control for the samples. All chemical shift values were presented relative to TSP at 0.00 ppm for both 1H and 13C. 1H 1D, 1H-13C HSQC, 1H-1H correlation spectroscopy (COSY) and 1H-13C heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (HMBC) spectra were acquired and analyzed. Results 2-hydroxyglutarate, an oncometabolite associated with gliomas with IDH mutations, was successfully detected and assigned by both 1H-13C HSQC and 1H-1H COSY experiments as well as 1H 1D experiments in two of the tissue samples. In particular, to our knowledge this work shows the first example of detecting 900 MHz 13C-NMR spectral lines of 2-hydroxyglutarate in human brain tumor tissue samples. In addition to the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate, at least 42 more metabolites were identified from our series of NMR experiment. Conclusion The detection of 2-hydroxyglutarate and other metabolites can be facilitated by homonuclear and heteronuclear two-dimensional 900 MHz NMR spectroscopy even in case of real tumor tissue sample extracts without physical separation of metabolites."
https://openalex.org/W2890279614,"The objective of this study was to quantify the possible decrease in school performance at five years of age in preterm children associated with parental separation or divorce, and to test whether this effect varies according to the child’s age at the time of the separation. This study included 3,308 infants delivered at < 35 weeks of gestation born between 2003 and 2011 who were enrolled in the population-based LIFT cohort and who had an optimal neurodevelopmental outcome at two years of age. These infants were evaluated by their teachers to assess their abilities and behavior when they had reached five years of age, using the Global School Adaptation (GSA) questionnaire. The mean GSA score was 50.8 points. Parental separations (assessed as parents either living together or living separately) were associated with a decrease in school performance at five years of age, although this was only the case for children who exhibited difficulties at school (3.7 points, p < 0.01). A decrease in school performance only occurred when parental separations took place between 3 and 5 years after the child’s birth. Parental separation was associated with a decrease in these children’s levels of motivation, autonomy, and manual dexterity. This study indicates that preterm infants of parents who had separated are particularly at risk of a lower scholar performance."
https://openalex.org/W2890418198,"TP53 is the most mutated gene in all cancers. The mutant protein also accumulates in cells. The high frequency of p53 mutations makes the protein a promising target for anti-cancer therapy. Only a few molecules have been found, using in vitro screening, to reactivate the mutant protein. APR-246 is currently the most successful mutant p53 activator, which reactivates the transcriptional activity of p53 by covalently binding to C124 of the protein. We have recently created in silico models of G245S-mp53 in its apo and DNA-bound forms. In this paper we further report on our in silico screening for potential activators of G245S-mp53. We filtered the ZINC15 database (13 million compounds) to only include drug-like molecules with moderate to standard reactivity. Our filtered database of 130,000 compounds was screened using the DOCKTITE protocol in the Molecular Operating Environment software. We performed covalent docking at C124 of G245S-mp53 to identify potential activators of the mutant protein. The docked compounds were ranked using a consensus scoring approach. We also used ADMET Predictor™ to predict pharmacokinetics and the possible toxicities of the compounds. Our screening procedure has identified compounds, mostly thiosemicarbazones and halo-carbonyls, with the best potential as G245S-mp53 activators, which are described in this work. Based on its binding scores and ADMET risk score, compound 2 is likely to have the best potential as a G245S-mp53 activator compared to the other top hits."
https://openalex.org/W2891439410,"Peatlands are spatially heterogeneous ecosystems that develop due to a complex set of autogenic physical and biogeochemical processes and allogenic factors such as the climate and topography. They are significant stocks of global soil carbon, and therefore predicting the depth of peatlands is an important part of establishing an accurate assessment of their magnitude. Yet there have been few attempts to account for both internal and external processes when predicting the depth of peatlands. Using blanket peatlands in Great Britain as a case study, we compare a linear and geostatistical (spatial) model and several sets of covariates applicable for peatlands around the world that have developed over hilly or undulating terrain. We hypothesized that the spatial model would act as a proxy for the autogenic processes in peatlands that can mediate the accumulation of peat on plateaus or shallow slopes. Our findings show that the spatial model performs better than the linear model in all cases—root mean square errors (RMSE) are lower, and 95% prediction intervals are narrower. In support of our hypothesis, the spatial model also better predicts the deeper areas of peat, and we show that its predictive performance in areas of deep peat is dependent on depth observations being spatially autocorrelated. Where they are not, the spatial model performs only slightly better than the linear model. As a result, we recommend that practitioners carrying out depth surveys fully account for the variation of topographic features in prediction locations, and that sampling approach adopted enables observations to be spatially autocorrelated."
https://openalex.org/W2892046683,"Following acute myocardial infarction, clinical studies show alterations in the blood levels of corin, a cardiac-selective activator of the natriuretic peptides pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (pro-ANP) and pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP). However, the temporal changes in circulating and cardiac corin levels and their relationships to the severity of myocardial infarction have not been studied. The main objective of this study was to examine the relationship between cardiac and circulating corin levels and their association with cardiac systolic function and infarct size during the early phase of acute myocardial infarction (<72 h) in a translationally relevant induced coronary ligation mouse model. This acute phase timeline was chosen to correlate with the clinical practice within which blood samples are collected from myocardial infarction patients. Heart and plasma samples were examined at 3, 24, and 72 hours post acute myocardial infarction. Plasma corin levels were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, transcripts of cardiac corin, pro-ANP and pro-BNP by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, cardiac corin expression by immunohistology, infarct size by histology and heart function by echocardiography. Plasma corin levels were significantly increased at 3 (P<0.05), 24 (P<0.001), and 72 hours (P<0.01) post-acute myocardial infarction. In contrast, cardiac corin transcript levels dropped by 5% (P>0.05), 69% (P<0.001) and 65% (P<0.001) and immunoreactive cardiac corin protein levels dropped by 30% (P<0.05), 76% (P<0.001) and 75% (P<0.001), while cardiac pro-ANP and pro-BNP transcript levels showed an opposite pattern. Plasma corin levels were negatively correlated with immunoreactive cardiac corin (P<0.01), ejection fraction (P<0.05) and fractional shortening (P<0.05), but positively correlated with infarct size (P<0.01). In conclusion, acute myocardial infarction induces rapid increases in plasma corin and decreases in cardiac corin levels. In the early phase of acute myocardial infarction, plasma corin levels are inversely correlated with heart function and may reflect the severity of myocardial damage."
https://openalex.org/W2889625152,"The presence of pathogenic bacteria in ejaculates has been a topic in boar semen preservation over the last decades. Since little information is available on commensal bacteria in boar semen, the aim of the present study was to identify commensal lactobacilli in fresh cryopreserved boar semen and to examine their influence on boar semen quality. Therefore, 111 boar ejaculates were investigated for the presence of Lactobacillus species. Thirty samples (27%) contained viable Lactobacillus species (e.g. L. amylovorus, L. animalis, L. reuteri and Weisella minor). L. animalis and L. buchneri DSM 32407 (isolated from the bovine uterus) qualified for further examinations based on their growth rate in six antibiotic-free boar semen extenders. After a 120 min short-term incubation with an antibiotic-free BTS-extender, progressive motility was diminished (P = 0.001) upon addition of 105 and 106 colony forming units (CFU/mL) L. animalis. The supplementation with L. buchneri DSM 32407 had no significant (P > 0.05) influence on sperm quality during short-term co-incubation. After 168 h long-term co-incubation, motility analysis revealed a negative (P = 0.026) impact of 105 CFU/mL L. buchneri DSM 32407. A concentration- and storage-dependent effect is particularly obvious (P < 0.001) using 106 CFU/mL L. buchneri DSM 32407. Most notably, the thermo-resistance (TRT) for 106 CFU/mL L. buchneri DSM 32407 (P = 0.001) was inferior to BTS with and without gentamicin after 72 and 168 h of semen co-incubation. The supplementation of 105 CFU/mL L. buchneri DSM 32407 impaired progressive motility to a lesser extent. The percentage of mitochondrially active spermatozoa after 96 h (P = 0.009) and membrane-intact spermatozoa after 168 h (P < 0.001) was lower when 106 CFU/mL L. buchneri DSM 32407 were suspended compared with all other groups. Finally, the addition of L. buchneri DSM 32407 to BTS-extended boar semen had no competitive effect on the total amount of bacteria 48 h after co-incubation. In summary, the present study demonstrated that there are Lactobacillus species present in the porcine seminal plasma, which can be cultivated using standard procedures. However, long-term co-incubation of lactic acid bacteria with spermatozoa had a negative influence on spermatozoa."

The aims of this study were to characterize symptom trajectories in patients with major depression during one year of collaborative care and to explore associations between baseline characteristics and symptom trajectories. Methods We conducted a cluster-randomized controlled trial in primary care. The collaborative care intervention comprised case management and behavioral activation. We used the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) to assess symptom severity as the primary outcome. Statistical analyses comprised latent growth mixture modeling and a hierarchical binary logistic regression model. Results We included 74 practices and 626 patients (310 intervention and 316 control recipients) at baseline. Based on a minimum of 12 measurement points for each intervention recipient, we identified two latent trajectories, which we labeled ‘fast improvers’ (60.5%) and ‘slow improvers’ (39.5%). At all measurements after baseline, ‘fast improvers’ presented higher PHQ mean values than ‘slow improvers’. At baseline, ‘fast improvers’ presented fewer physical conditions, higher health-related quality of life, and had made fewer suicide attempts in their history. Conclusions A notable proportion of 39.5% of patients improved only ‘slowly’ and probably needed more intense treatment. The third follow-up in month two could well be a sensible time to adjust treatment to support ‘slow improvers’."
https://openalex.org/W2891749005,"This study examines differential effects of immersion, elevated oxygen partial pressure, and exercise on pulmonary function after series of five daily six-hour dives at 130 kPa (1.3 ATA), with 18 hours between dives. Five cohorts of 10 to 14 divers participated. The exposure phases were resting while breathing O2 or air in the water (“wetO2”, “wetAir”) or O2 in the hyperbaric chamber (“dryO2”), and exercise in the water while breathing O2 or air (“wetO2X”, “wetAirX”). Respiratory symptoms were recorded during and after each dive, and pulmonary function (forced flow-volume) was measured twice at baseline before diving, after each dive both immediately and on the following morning, and three days post diving (“Day+3”). The incidences of symptoms and of flow volume changes from baseline greater than normal limits (“ΔFV”) were assessed, as were mean ΔFV. The parameters examined were forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expired volume in 1 second (FEV1), and forced expired flow from 25% to 75% volume expired (FEF25–75). The phases ranked from greatest to least fraction of diver-days with symptoms were wetO2X (56%) > dryO2 (42%) > wetO2 (13%) > [wetAir (2%) or wetAirX (1%)] (p<0.05). FEV1 and FEF25–75 were depressed in the morning following wetO2 and wetO2X and on Day+3 after and wetO2X, but increased immediately following each wetAirX dive. O2 exposures caused symptoms and ΔFV suggestive of pulmonary oxygen toxicity,exacerbated by exercise. Indices of small airway function showed late (17-hour) post-O2 exposure deficits, but, particularly with exercise, improvement was evident early after exposure with or without O2. FEF25–75 and FEV1 remained depressed on Day+3 after wetO2 and wetO2X."
https://openalex.org/W2891037332,"Introduction Alcohol use is a key risk factor for disease worldwide. Consumption of alcohol is increasing in sub Saharan Africa, where youth are already at high risk of HIV due to its high prevalence in the region. Studies show that youth begin drinking alcohol early; however, there is a need to further explore the initiation of alcohol use in order to design appropriate interventions in this population. Methods We conducted a qualitative study with youth in Mwanza and Kilimanjaro regions in Tanzania to explore alcohol consumption among youth. Participants were a purposive sample of youth aged 15–24 composed of secondary school and college students, and formal and informal sector employees. We conducted 35 in-depth interviews using a semi-structured guide to understand youth’s personal experiences with alcohol consumption. Two social scientists conducted a multi stage, inductive analysis of the data. Findings Alcohol consumption was reported to mainly start during adolescence, although in some cases it started as early as at 10 years of age. Young women reported drinking less, and initiated drinking later compared to males. Social space assumed a primary role in alcohol initiation. The social environment and influence of important social actors were key aspects of youth’s social space. Youth reported starting to consume alcohol at home, social events and in stressful environments with key influencers being parents, relatives, peers and intimate partners. Conclusions Our findings show that the social space (social environment and interactions) plays an important role in influencing youth initial consumption of alcohol. Interventions addressing alcohol initiation among the population need to address the social spaces where initiation takes place and engage the significant actors in these spaces. There is need to further explore underlying societal drinking norms to better understand how they shape social environments and young people’s initiation of alcohol use."

The main sex pheromone components of Spodoptera litura are (Z,E)-9,11- and (Z,E)-9,12-tetradecadienyl acetate (Z9,E11-14:Ac; Z9,E12-14:Ac). In this study, we investigated the optimal conditions for encapsulation of S. litura sex pheromonesin micelles via the self-assembly method using monomethoxy poly (ethylene glycol)-poly (ε-caprolactone) (MPEG-PCL) as a biodegradable wall-forming material with low toxicity. In the L9(3(4) orthogonal experiment, 3 amphiphilic block copolymers, with different hydrophilicity to hydrophobicity ratios, were examined. Optimal encapsulation conditions included stirring of MPEG5000-PCL2000 at 1000 rpm at 30°C with 2.5:1 wall-forming: core material mass ratio. S. litura sex pheromone-loaded MPEG5000-PCL2000 micelles presented a homogeneous spherical morphology with apparent core-shell structure. The release kinetics of optimized MPEG5000-PCL2000 micelles was best explained by a first-order model. Encapsulated Z9,E11-14:Ac and Z9,E12-14:Ac were released slowly, not suddenly. Methyl oleate (MO) was used as an agent to control micellar release performance. When MO content equalled block content, micelle half-life could be prolonged, thereby controlling the release speed. Overall, our results showed MPEG-PCL as a promising controlled-release substrate for sex pheromones."

This study examines the definitions, explanatory models, signs and symptoms, and healthcare-seeking behaviours common to Fang culture-bound syndromes (i.e., kong, eluma, witchcraft, mibili, mikug, and nsamadalu). The Fang ethnic group is the majority ethnic group in Equatorial Guinea. From September 2012 to January 2013, 45 key Fang informants were selected, including community leaders, tribal elders, healthcare workers, traditional healers, and non-Catholic pastors in 39 of 724 Fang tribal villages in 6 of 13 districts in the mainland region of Equatorial Guinea. An ethnographic approach with an emic-etic perspective was employed. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews, participant observation and a questionnaire that included DHS6 key indicators. Interviews were designed based on the Cultural Formulation form in the DSM-5 and explored the definition of Fang cultural syndromes, symptoms, cultural perceptions of cause, and current help-seeking. Participants defined “Fang culture-bound syndromes"" as those diseases that cannot be cured, treated, or diagnosed by science. Such syndromes present with the same signs and symptoms as diseases identified by Western medicine. However, they arise because of the actions of enemies, because of the actions of spirits or ancestors, as punishments for disregarding the law of God, because of the violation of sexual or dietary taboos, or because of the violation of a Fang rite of passage, the dzas, which is celebrated at birth. Six Fang culture-bound syndromes were included in the study: 1) Eluma, a disease that is targeted at the victim out of envy and starts out with sharp, intense, focussed pain and aggressiveness; 2) Witchcraft, characterized by isolation from the outside, socially maladaptive behaviour, and the use of hallucinogenic substances; 3) Kong, which is common among the wealthy class and manifests as a disconnection from the environment and a lack of vital energy; 4) Mibili, a possession by evil spirits that manifests through visual and auditory hallucinations; 5) Mikug, which appears after a person has had contact with human bones in a ritual; and 6) Nsamadalu, which emerges after a traumatic process caused by violating traditions through having sexual relations with one’s sister or brother. The therapeutic resources of choice for addressing Fang culture-bound syndromes were traditional Fang medicine and the religious practices of the Bethany and Pentecostal churches, among others. Among African ethnic groups, symbolism, the weight of tradition, and the principle of chance in health and disease are underlying factors in the presentation of certain diseases, which in ethno-psychiatry are now referred to as culture-bound syndromes. In this study, traditional healers, elders, healthcare professionals, religious figures, and leaders of the Fang community in Equatorial Guinea referred to six such cultural syndromes: eluma, witchcraft, kong, mibili, mikug, and nsamadalu. In the absence of a multidisciplinary approach to mental illness in the country, the Fang ethnic group seeks healthcare for culture-bound syndromes from traditional healing and religious rites in the Evangelical faiths."
https://openalex.org/W2889688675,"Although advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques provide useful information for the differential diagnosis of intra-axial mass-like lesions, the specific diagnostic role of multimodal MRI over conventional magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) alone in the differential diagnosis of mass-like lesions from a large heterogeneous cohort has not been studied. In this study, we aimed to determine the added value of a joint approach of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and dynamic-susceptibility-contrast perfusion imaging (DSC-PWI) for diagnosis of intra-axial mass-like lesions, comparing them with CMRI alone. Furthermore, we performed these evaluations in a manner simulating clinical practice. Our institutional review board approved this retrospective study and waived the requirement for informed consent. A total of 1038 patients with intra-axial mass-like lesions were retrospectively recruited according to their histological and clinico-radiological diagnoses made between January 2005 and December 2014. All patients underwent CMRI, DWI and DSC-PWI. The diagnostic accuracy and confidence in diagnosing each type of intra-axial mass-like lesions, and for differentiating the intra-axial brain tumors from non-neoplastic lesions, were compared according to the MRI protocols. The disease-specific sensitivity of joint approach differed according to specific disease entities in diagnosing each disease category. Joint approach provided the best diagnostic accuracy for discriminating intra-axial brain tumors from non-neoplastic lesions, with high diagnostic accuracy (95.3-96.7%), specificity (82-84.0%), positive-predictive-value (97.0-97.3%), and negative-predictive-value (84.8-92.7%), with the reader's confidence values being significantly improved over those on CMRI alone (all p-values < 0.001). In conclusion, joint approach of DWI, DSC-PWI to CMRI helps to differentiate non-neoplastic lesions from intra-axial brain tumors, and improves diagnostic confidence compared with CMRI alone. The benefit from the combined imaging differs for each disease category; thus joint approach needs to be customized according to clinical suspicion."
https://openalex.org/W2890092386,"To develop a 4D dose reconstruction method and to evaluate the delivered dose in respiratory-gated volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT).A total 112 treatment sessions of gated VMAT for 30 stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) patients (10 lung, 10 liver, and 10 pancreas) were evaluated. For respiratory-gated SBRT, 4DCT was acquired, and the CT data at the end-exhale phase was used for a VMAT plan. The delivered dose was reconstructed using a patient's respiratory motion and machine motion acquired during the beam delivery. The machine motion was obtained from the treatment log file, while the target position was estimated from an external respiratory marker position. The target position was divided into 1-mm position bins, and sub-beams with beam isocenters corresponding to each position bin were created in a motion mimicking plan, reflecting motion data including MLC leaf positions and gantry angle and target position data during beam treatment. The reconstructed 4D dose was compared with the dose of the original plan using these dosimetric parameters; the maximum dose (Dmax) and mean dose (Dmean) of gross target volume (GTV) or organs at risk (spinal cord, esophagus, heart, duodenum, kidney, spinal cord, and stomach). The minimum dose (Dmin) to GTV was also calculated to verify cold spots in tumors.There was no significant difference of dose parameters regard to the GTV in all tumors. For the liver cases, there were significant differences in the Dmax of duodenum (-4.2 ± 1.4%), stomach (-3.5 ± 4.2%), left kidney (-4.1 ± 2.8%), and right kidney (-3.2 ± 1.3%), and in the Dmean of duodenum (-3.8 ± 1.4%), stomach (-3.9 ± 2.2%), left kidney (-3.1 ± 2.8%), and right kidney (-4.1 ± 2.6%). For the pancreas cases, there were significant differences in the Dmax of stomach (2.1 ± 3.0%), and in the Dmean of liver (1.5 ± 0.6%), duodenum (-1.0 ± 1.4%), stomach (2.1 ± 1.6%), and right kidney (-1.3 ± 0.9%). The average gamma pass rates were 97.6 ± 4.8% for lung cases, 99.6 ± 0.5% for liver cases, and 99.5 ± 0.5% for pancreas cases. Most cases showed insignificant dose variation, with gamma pass rates higher than 98%, except for two lung cases with gamma pass rates of 86.9% and 90.6%. The low gamma pass rates showed larger global motion ranges resulting from the baseline shift during beam delivery.The actual delivered dose in thoracic and abdominal VMAT under breathing motion was verified by 4D dose reconstruction using typical treatment equipment and software. The proposed method provides a verification method for the actual delivered dose and could be a dosimetric verification QA tool for radiation treatment under various respiratory management techniques."
https://openalex.org/W2891377582,"The effect of dietary level of two types of inulin on amine concentration, redox status and DNA glycosylase activity in the colon of piglets was investigated. Seven groups of piglets were fed diets without inulin addition (control) or with 1%, 2% or 3% inulin with an average degree of polymerisation of 10 (IN10) or 23 (IN23) for 40 days. The 2% and 3% IN10 diets increased tryptamine concentration in the proximal colon, while methylamine concentration in the distal colon was increased by the 1% and 3% IN10 diets. The 1% and 2% IN23 diets increased phenylethylamine and methylamine concentration in the proximal colon, respectively, while 1,7-diaminoheptane content was increased by both diets. Its concentration in the middle and distal colon was increased by the 1% and 2% IN23 diet, respectively. There was no improvement in the oxidant-antioxidant balance in colonic digesta of piglets fed IN10 and IN23 diets. Piglets fed IN10 diets had lower 1,N6-etheno-2’-deoxyadenosine excision activity in each colon segment, as compared with the control group. It was also reduced by the 2% and 3% IN23 diets in the proximal colon, while in the middle and distal colon by all IN23 diets. Feeding all IN10 and IN23 diets reduced 3,N4-etheno-2’-deoxycytidine and 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine excision activities in each colon segment. Feeding IN10 and IN23 diets neither decreased amine concentrations nor improved the oxidant-antioxidant balance in colonic digesta of piglets. However, both types of inulin efficiently reduced the activity of DNA repair enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2890775821,"In the development of new vaccines, understanding the level of vaccine-induced antibody that is sufficient to protect against disease can simplify and expedite the development and licensing process. If there is an accepted threshold antibody level that is indicative of protection, then smaller trials measuring antibody concentration alone can be conducted to test new vaccines, instead of large efficacy studies powered on clinical outcomes. Commonly, threshold levels of protective antibody are determined from clinical efficacy trials in which clinical endpoints are measured on everyone and a small subset of participants have antibody concentrations measured. The proportion of participants with antibody below a threshold in each group in the immunogenicity subset can be compared to the proportions with disease in each group in the larger trial to find an appropriate threshold. Mathematically, this method seeks to compute an absolute threshold whereby antibody above the threshold provides complete, sterilizing immunity. However, in practice it is often understood that such thresholds may only be indicative of a relative degree of protection rather than an absolute one. Although this approach is common, the accuracy of such methods when the underlying mathematical assumptions do not hold true, has never been tested. We simulated data from clinical trial scenarios under varying assumptions of vaccine efficacy and calculated antibody thresholds of protection. We estimated the bias in the calculated thresholds derived from each scenario and showed that in many situations this method produces inflated estimates of thresholds, particularly if a vaccine induces high levels of antibody or when the underlying assumption of sterilizing immunity is violated."
https://openalex.org/W2891320029,"In intergroup conflicts, expressed emotions influence how others see and react to those who express them. Here, we investigated whether this in turn implies that emotions may be expressed strategically. We tested whether emotion expression can differ from emotion experience, and whether emotion expression (more than emotion experience) is used to pursue specific goals. Specifically, we focused on whether support-seeking emotions (fear and sadness) are used to call for support from a powerful third party and contempt to distance from an antagonistic out-group. In two studies, using the same ostensible conflict, we manipulated whether participants communicated their emotions towards the out-group (no vs. yes) and third party (no vs. yes) and employed a between-subjects design in Study 1 (N = 86) and a within-subjects design in Study 2 (N = 83). In both studies, we found that members of a disadvantaged group expressed reduced support-seeking emotions towards the out-group than they experienced (i.e., in conditions without an audience), providing support for the assumption that emotion expression does not necessarily reflect experience. Further, in Study 2, we found in line with expectations that the goal to call for support was more important in the communication with the third party than with the antagonistic out-group. The goal was best predicted by expressed support-seeking emotions, providing support for the assumption that emotion expression is used to pursue goals. Interestingly, we only found this association for a beneficial goal (i.e., calling for support) and not for distancing, a destructive goal. These results support the proposed strategic use of emotion expression and as such advance our understanding of the function of expressed emotions."
https://openalex.org/W2892232905,"The Semi-solid Control Diagram (SSCD) is a new tool designed for the study of different excipients and different semi-solid dosage forms. It can be used to review and evaluate different formulations and/or batches and facilitate the selection of one of them that will present the most suitable galenic characteristics for topical application. It is also useful to track stability studies by comparing the diagrams, which allows to measure the impact of subjecting the formulation to different conditions and times to be examined. In this study, the Semi-solid Control Diagram (SSCD) is used as an instrument for studying and evaluating semi-solid pharmaceutical dosage forms, by comparing several different semisolid preparations (lipogels). With these results, the tool is validated and the best formulation has been discriminated from the others."
https://openalex.org/W2890438661,"Introduction Zambia has made substantial investments in health systems capacity, yet it remains unclear whether improved service quality improves outcomes. We investigated the association between health system capacity and use of prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission (PMTCT) services in Zambia. Materials and methods We analyzed data from two studies conducted in rural and semi-urban Lusaka Province in 2014–2015. Health system capacity, our primary exposure, was measured with a validated balanced scorecard approach. Based on WHO building blocks for health systems strengthening, we derived overall and domain-specific facility scores (range: 0–100), with higher scores indicating greater capacity. Our outcome, community-level maternal antiretroviral drug use at 12 months postpartum, was measured via self-report in a large cohort study evaluating PMTCT program impact. Associations between health systems capacity and our outcome were analyzed via linear regression. Results Among 29 facilities, median overall facility score was 72 (IQR:67–74). Median domain scores were: patient satisfaction 75 (IQR 71–78); human resources 85 (IQR:63–87); finance 50 (IQR:50–67); governance 82 (IQR:74–91); service capacity 77 (IQR:68–79); service provision 60 (IQR:52–76). Our programmatic outcome was measured from 804 HIV-infected mothers. Median community-level antiretroviral use at 12 months was 81% (IQR:69–89%). Patient satisfaction was the only domain score significantly associated with 12-month maternal antiretroviral use (β:0.22; p = 0.02). When we excluded the human resources and finance domains, we found a positive association between composite 4-domain facility score and 12-month maternal antiretroviral use in peri-urban but not rural facilities. Conclusions In these Zambian health facilities, patient satisfaction was positively associated with maternal antiretroviral 12 months postpartum. The association between overall health system capacity and maternal antiretroviral drug use was stronger in peri-urban versus rural facilities. Additional work is needed to guide strategic investments for improved outcomes in HIV and broader maternal-child health region-wide."
https://openalex.org/W2805648112,"Social status is often metaphorically construed in terms of spatial relations such as height, size, and numerosity. This has led to the idea that social status might partially be represented by an analogue magnitude system, responsible for processing the magnitude of various physical and abstract dimensions. Accordingly, processing of social status should obey Weber's law. We conducted three studies to investigate whether social status comparisons would indicate behavioral outcomes derived from Weber's law: the distance effect and the size effect. Dependent variable was the latency of status comparisons for a variety of both learned and familiar hierarchies. As predicted and in line with previous findings, we observed a clear distance effect. However, the effect of size variation differed from the size effect hypothesized a priori, and an unexpected interaction between the two effects was observed. In conclusion, we provide a robust confirmation of previous observations of the distance effect in social status comparisons, but the shape of the size effect requires new theorizing."
https://openalex.org/W2890394148,"Background Understanding pattern of antimalarials use at large scale helps ensuring appropriate use of treatments and preventing the spread of resistant parasites. We estimated the proportion of individuals in community surveys with residual antimalarials in their blood and identified the factors associated with the presence of the most commonly detected drugs, lumefantrine and/or desbutyl-lumefantrine (LF/DLF) or sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP). Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2015 in three regions of Tanzania with different levels of malaria endemicity. Interviews were conducted and blood samples collected through household surveys for further antimalarial measurements using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. In addition, diagnosis and treatment availability was investigated through outlet surveys. Multilevel mixed effects logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios for having LF/DLF or SP in the blood. Results Amongst 6391 participants, 12.4% (792/6391) had LF/DLF and 8.0% (510/6391) SP in the blood. Factors associated with higher odds of detecting LF/DLF in the blood included fever in the previous two weeks (OR = 2.6, p<0.001), living in districts of higher malaria prevalence (OR = 1.5, p<0.001) and living in a ward in which all visited drug stores had artemisinin-based combination therapies in stocks (OR = 2.7, p = 0.020). Participants in older age groups were less likely to have LF/DLF in the blood (OR = 0.9, p<0.001). Factors associated with higher odds of having SP in the blood included being pregnant (OR = 4.6, p<0.001), living in Mwanza (OR = 3.9, p<0.001 compared to Mbeya), fever in the previous two weeks (OR = 1.7, p<0.001) and belonging to older age groups (OR = 1.2, p<0.001). Conclusion The most significant predictors identified were expected. History of fever in the past two weeks and young age were significant predictors of LF/DLF in the blood, which is encouraging. Antimalarial drug pressure was high and hence the use of recommended first-line drugs in combination with malaria Rapid Diagnostics Tests should be promoted to ensure appropriate treatment."
