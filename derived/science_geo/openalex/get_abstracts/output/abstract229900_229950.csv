https://openalex.org/W2130253814,"Antigen-presenting cells (APC) tailor immune responses to microbial encounters by stimulating differentiation of CD4 T cells into the Th1 and Th2 lineages. We demonstrate that APC use the Notch pathway to instruct T cell differentiation. Strikingly, of the two Notch ligand families, Delta induces Th1, while Jagged induces the alternate Th2 fate. Expression of these different Notch ligands on APC is induced by Th1- or Th2-promoting stimuli. Th2 differentiation has been considered a default process as APC-derived instructive signals are unknown. We demonstrate that Jagged constitutes an instructive signal for Th2 differentiation, which is independent of IL4/STAT6. Th2 differentiation induced by APC is abrogated in T cells lacking the Notch effector RBPJκ. Notch directs Th2 differentiation by inducing GATA3 and by directly regulating il4 gene transcription through RBPJκ sites in a 3′ enhancer."
https://openalex.org/W2157296254,"NAD+ is essential for life in all organisms, both as a coenzyme for oxidoreductases and as a source of ADPribosyl groups used in various reactions, including those that retard aging in experimental systems. Nicotinic acid and nicotinamide were defined as the vitamin precursors of NAD+ in Elvehjem's classic discoveries of the 1930s. The accepted view of eukaryotic NAD+ biosynthesis, that all anabolism flows through nicotinic acid mononucleotide, was challenged experimentally and revealed that nicotinamide riboside is an unanticipated NAD+ precursor in yeast. Nicotinamide riboside kinases from yeast and humans essential for this pathway were identified and found to be highly specific for phosphorylation of nicotinamide riboside and the cancer drug tiazofurin. Nicotinamide riboside was discovered as a nutrient in milk, suggesting that nicotinamide riboside is a useful compound for elevation of NAD+ levels in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2019923915,"The association of genes with the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and nuclear transport factors has been implicated in transcriptional regulation. We therefore examined the association of components of the nuclear transport machinery including karyopherins, nucleoporins, and the Ran guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (RanGEF) with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome. We find that most nucleoporins and karyopherins preferentially associate with a subset of highly transcribed genes and with genes that possess Rap1 binding sites whereas the RanGEF preferentially associates with transcriptionally inactive genes. Consistent with coupling of transcription to the nuclear pore, we show that transcriptional activation of the GAL genes results in their association with nuclear pore proteins, relocation to the nuclear periphery, and loss of RanGEF association. Taken together, these results indicate that the organization of the genome is coupled via transcriptional state to the nuclear transport machinery."

Here we describe a unique signaling mechanism by which cells detect and respond to stress in order to survive. A wide variety of stress stimuli rapidly increase nucleocytoplasmic protein modification by O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc), an essential post-translational modification of Ser and Thr residues of metazoans. Blocking this post-translational modification, or reducing it, renders cells more sensitive to stress and results in decreased cell survival; and increasing O-GlcNAc levels protects cells. O-GlcNAc regulates both the rates and extent of the stress-induced induction of heat shock proteins, providing a molecular basis for these findings.

O-GlcNAc is thought to act as a modulator of protein function, in a manner analogous to protein phosphorylation; the addition of O-GlcNAc to the protein backbone is dynamic and responds to morphogens, the cell cycle, and changes in glucose metabolism (1Wells L. Vosseller K. Hart G.W. Science. 2001; 291: 2376-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar).

Based upon these data, and recent observations suggesting that heat shock protein (HSP) 70 may act as an O-GlcNAc lectin (65Lefebvre T. Cieniewski C. Lemoine J. Guerardel Y. Leroy Y. Zanetta J.P. Michalski J.C. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), we investigated the possible link between stress tolerance and O-GlcNAc. We demonstrate that in response to all forms of cellular stress tested, multiple cell lines rapidly and dynamically increase O-GlcNAc levels on a myriad of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. Moreover, modulation of O-GlcNAc levels alters thermotolerance. Increasing O-GlcNAc levels result in cells that are more thermotolerant, whereas decreasing levels of O-GlcNAc protein modification led to cells that are more sensitive to thermal stress. The extent of O-GlcNAc protein modification appears to affect the levels of the heat shock proteins, HSP70 and HSP40, suggesting a molecular mechanism for these findings. This study provides a molecular link, O-GlcNAc, between glucose metabolism and stress tolerance and suggests a new paradigm in the regulation of stress-mediated signal transduction pathways. Cell lines and Culture Conditions—All cells (unless indicated) were from the ATCC and were maintained in DMEM (1 g/liter; Mediatech) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified incubator at 5% CO2. Cells were seeded ∼48 h prior to the beginning of stress treatments as follows: COS-7 (green monkey kidney cells), HeLa (human), Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO), and mouse neuroblastoma cells (Neuro-2A) cells were seeded at 4 × 105 cells in 100-mm plates or 5 × 104 in 6-well plates, whereas human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells were seeded at 8 × 105 cells in 100-mm plates. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were maintained in DMEM (4.5g/liter glucose) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS and penicillin/streptomycin (66O'Donnell N. Zachara N.E. Hart G.W. Marth J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; : 1680-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded at 1 × 106 in 100-mm plates or 2 × 105 in 6-well plates. Primary human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC, Clonetics) were cultured according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were treated with 100 μm O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranosylidene) amino-N-phenylcarbamate (PUGNAc; in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS); Carbogen, Switzerland) or 20 μm 6-diazo-5-oxonorleucine (DON; in Me2SO; Sigma) for 18 h prior to the beginning of experiments. 20 μg/ml cycloheximide (in ethanol; Sigma), 100 μm chloroquine (in PBS; Sigma), and 20 μm ALLN (in Me2SO; Sigma) were incubated with cells for 1 h prior to the initiation of experiments. Stress Treatments—Cell culture media were changed 1 h prior to stress treatments. Thermal treatments were performed in a humidified incubator (5% CO2), and at the end of the heat treatment cells were returned to 37 °C. COS-7, CHO, HeLa, and Neuro-2A cells were placed at 45 °C for 1 h, whereas HEK293, HCAEC, and MEF cells were placed at 42 °C for 1 h. The different temperatures are representative of different basal levels of thermotolerance. Treatments were optimized and resulted in less than 10% cell death. Experiments were performed in duplicate a minimum of four times. For multiple stress experiments, cells were serum-starved for 18 h prior to stress treatments. Cells were treated for 8 h as follows: 1 mm H2O2, 50 μm CoCl2, 4% (v/v) ethanol, 100 mm NaCl (in addition to physiological saline), 75 μm sodium arsenite. In other treatments, cells were thermally stressed as above or treated with UVB light for 90 s and recovered at 37 °C for 8 h. Treatment levels were chosen that resulted in <10% cell death and are similar to those reported by others. Experiments were performed in duplicate a minimum of four times. In densitometry derived from these experiments, error bars represent 1 S.D. p values are the result of a paired Student's t test (two-tailed). For densitometry O-GlcNAc levels were normalized to actin to control for protein load Analysis of Proteins—Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, harvested, and extracted with 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 in Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μm PUGNAc, 5 mm KF, 0.5 mm orthovanadate, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm EDTA, PIC1, and PIC2.

Densitometry was performed by using nonsaturated chemiluminescent exposed films and quantitated using MacBAS bio-imaging analyzer (version 2.5, Fuji Photo Film Co). Typically, multiple exposures from the same experiment were used to confirm that the signal was within the linear range. Levels of O-GlcNAc in the entire lane were normalized to the appropriate control (actin or tubulin) and then expressed as a percentage of control (set at 100%). In all instances, data are averaged from independent experiments. O-GlcNAcase and OGT Assays—Total cell extracts (40 μg), either Nonidet P-40 (described above) or nuclear/cytoplasmic extracts (69Wells L. Vosseller K. Cole R.N. Cronshaw J.M. Matunis M.J. Hart G.W. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2002; 1: 791-804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), were assayed for O-GlcNAcase (EC 3.2.1.52) activity, the enzyme that removes O-GlcNAc, by using p-nitrophenyl phosphate-GlcNAc as described earlier (70Gao Y.

Activity is reported as micromoles of cleavage per min per mg of cell extract. To determine OGT activity, OGT was immunoprecipitated from Nonidet P-40 extracts (described above) of heat-stressed cells as follows. Nonidet P-40 extracts (500 μg) were diluted to 0.5 mg/ml and 0.2% Nonidet P-40 and were pre-cleared with preimmune antibody (100 μl) covalently coupled to CNBr-activated agarose (6 mg/ml) for 2 h at 4 °C. Extracts were then precipitated with anti-OGT antibody (AL28; 100 μl) covalently coupled to CNBr-activated agarose (6 mg/ml) for 2 h at 4 °C. Resin was washed with 1 ml each of Tris-HCl-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (Tris-buffered saline), 0.2% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, Tris-buffered saline, and OGT desalting buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 20% glycerol, 0.02% azide). OGT was assayed on beads against the casein kinase II acceptor peptide as reported previously (38Kreppel L.K. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32015-32022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Activity is reported as micromoles of GlcNAc transferred to casein kinase II per min per mg of cell extract immunoprecipitated. Activity was normalized to levels of OGT in cell precipitates by densitometry. Cre-Lox Recombination—Viral infections using adenovirus carrying either a control vector (Neo) and Cre-recombinase vector (Cre) were carried out as reported previously (66O'Donnell N. Zachara N.E. Hart G.W. Marth J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; : 1680-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), except that 1 × 106 cells were seeded in 100-mm plates. Infected cells were selected in G418 (final 1 mg/ml). Prior to stress and thermal kill experiments, G418 was washed out, and cells were allowed to recover for 2 h. Thermal Survival—Media were changed 1 h prior to the initiation of thermal survival experiments. Cells were stressed at the indicated temperatures (45–48 °C depending on cell type) in a humidified incubator (5% CO2) for 0–80 min and then placed at 37 °C for 24 h. Cell viability was assessed using the crystal violet method (72Andreoni G. Angeretti N. Lucca E. Forloni G. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 148: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To allow for differences in growth rates derived from modulating O-GlcNAc levels, viability is expressed as a percentage of unstressed cells. All experiments were performed a minimum of three times, and numbers are derived from at least four replicates. Error bars represent 1 S.D.; p values are the result of a paired Student's t test (two-tailed). RNA Interference (RNAi)—Neuro-2A cells were seeded at 1 × 105 in 6-well plates in DMEM (1g/liter glucose) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS and penicillin/streptomycin. At 24 h media were changed to Opti-MEM (Invitrogen), and cells were transfected with duplex (5 nm) using siPORTamine (Ambion, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Media were changed after 24 h, and experiments were initiated at 36 h post-transfection. RNAi duplexes were designed against the murine OGT sequence. Note an equal mixture of OGT1 and OGT2 was used. Duplexes were created using the Silencer™ siRNA construction kit (Ambion, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The oligonucleotides used are as follows: OGT1, AAGCAATCGAGCATTATCGAC; OGT2, AAGTTTGAGCCCAAATCATGC; scrambled, CAGTCGCGTTTGCGACTGGTT. Plasmids and Transfections—OGT was subcloned from pCiteOGT (SalI/NotI; gift of S. Iyer, The Johns Hopkins University) into pShuttle (NheI/NotI). COS-7 cells were seeded at 1 × 105 in 6-well plates in DMEM (1g/liter glucose) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS and penicillin/streptomycin, and the latter was removed ∼24 h prior to transfection. Cells were transfected with 2–3 μg of DNA (pShuttle or pShuttle-OGT) using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection reagent was replaced with media after 8 h. After 24 h, media were again replaced, and thermotolerance was determined. O-GlcNAc Levels Increase in Response to Multiple Forms of Cellular Stress—To investigate the possible role of the O-GlcNAc protein modification in stress response pathways, levels of O-GlcNAc were determined after cells were subjected to different forms of cellular stress. Remarkably, in response to all stress-inducing agents tested, levels of O-GlcNAc became elevated (Fig. 1, A and E) as follows: lane 1, control; lane 2, H2O2 (144 ± 12%); lane 3, CoCl2 (151 ± 13%); lane 4, UVB light (145 ± 18%); lane 5, ethanol (142 ± 21%); lane 6, NaCl (195 ± 18%); lane 7, heat shock (172 ± 24%); and lane 8, sodium arsenite (230 ± 27%). Similar data were observed in cells with and without serum (data not shown). The level of OGT, the enzyme that catalyzes the addition of O-GlcNAc to the protein backbone, was also examined. All forms of stress, except hyperthermia, induced higher levels of OGT protein expression (Fig. 1C). Notably, increased O-GlcNAc protein modification in response to stress is dose-dependent (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Increased O-GlcNAc protein modification of nucleocytoplasmic proteins is dose-dependent. A, COS-7 cells were treated with iodoacetamide (25–75 μm, as indicated) for 7 h. Levels of O-GlcNAc (upper panel) and actin (middle panel) in total cell extract (30 μg/lane) were determined in duplicate by immunoblot. Densitometry of O-GlcNAc normalized to actin is shown in the lower panel. C, control; WB, Western blot. B, COS-7 cells were treated with UVB light (30–90 s, as indicated) and recovered at 37 °C for 7 h. Levels of O-GlcNAc (upper panel) and actin (middle panel) in total cell extract (30 μg/lane) were determined in duplicate by immunoblot. Densitometry of O-GlcNAc normalized to actin is shown in the lower panel. C, COS-7 cells were treated with heat shock (HS) 45 °C for 1 h (recovery for 6 h at 37 °C) or were treated with 1% v/v or 4% v/v ethanol for 7 h. Levels of O-GlcNAc (upper panel) and actin (middle panel) in total cell extract (20 μg/lane) were determined in duplicate by immunoblot. Densitometry of O-GlcNAc normalized to actin is shown in the lower panel. D, COS-7 cells were treated with heat shock (HS) at 45 °C for 1 h (recovery for 6hat37 °C) or were treated with 25 or 75 μm sodium arsenite for 7 h. Levels of O-GlcNAc (upper panel) and actin (middle panel) in total cell extract (20 μg/lane) were determined in duplicate by immunoblot. Densitometry of O-GlcNAc normalized to actin is shown in the lower panel. In all figures, error bars represent 1 S.D. p values are the result of a Student's t test (two-tailed).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Increased O-GlcNAc protein modification induced by cellular stress is a widespread response. Elevated O-GlcNAc in response to thermal and osmotic stress was observed in several different cell types including MEFs, CHO cells, HEK293 cells, Neuro-2a cells, HeLa cells, and primary HCAECs (data not shown). These data suggest that increased O-GlcNAc is a target and effector of stress response pathways. O-GlcNAc Is Added Rapidly and Dynamically in Response to Thermal Stress—To determine whether O-GlcNAc was added to proteins in a dynamic fashion, consistent with a role in stress-associated signal transduction pathways, the rate of addition of O-GlcNAc in response to hyperthermia was studied. O-GlcNAc levels were appreciably elevated at the termination of thermal stress (Fig. 3A, time post-heat stress, 0 min), suggesting that O-GlcNAc addition is rapidly induced soon after the initiation of hyperthermia. This addition is dynamic, as levels of O-GlcNAc continued to increase for 9 h but are reduced by 24 h and return to normal by 48 h (Fig. 3B). Notably, O-GlcNAc induction occurs prior to elevation of HSP70 protein levels (Fig. 3B"
https://openalex.org/W1970339000,"Transmission of malaria parasites to mosquitoes is initiated by the obligatory sexual reproduction of the parasite within the mosquito bloodmeal. Differentiation of specialized transmission stages, the gametocytes, into male and female gametes is induced by a small mosquito molecule, xanthurenic acid (XA). Using a Plasmodium berghei strain expressing a bioluminescent calcium sensor, we show that XA triggers a rapid rise in cytosolic calcium specifically in gametocytes that is essential for their differentiation into gametes. A member of a family of plant-like calcium dependent protein kinases, CDPK4, is identified as the molecular switch that translates the XA-induced calcium signal into a cellular response by regulating cell cycle progression in the male gametocyte. CDPK4 is shown to be essential for the sexual reproduction and mosquito transmission of P. berghei. This study reveals an unexpected function for a plant-like signaling pathway in cell cycle regulation and life cycle progression of a malaria parasite."

We have shown previously that genetic disruption of the S1P1 receptor, the most widely expressed of the family, results in embryonic lethality because of its key role within endothelial cells in regulating the coverage of blood vessels by vascular smooth muscle cells. To understand the physiologic functions of the two other widely expressed S1P receptors, we generated S1P2 and S1P3 null mice. Neither the S1P2 null mice nor the S1P3 null mice exhibited significant embryonic lethality or obvious phenotypic abnormalities. To unmask possible overlapping or collaborative functions between the S1P1, S1P2, and S1P3 receptors, we examined embryos with multiple S1P receptor mutations. We found that S1P1 S1P2 double null and S1P1 S1P2 S1P3 triple null embryos displayed a substantially more severe vascular phenotype than did embryos with only S1P1 deleted. We also found partial embryonic lethality and vascular abnormalities in S1P2 S1P3 double null embryos. Our results indicate that the S1P1, S1P2 and S1P3 receptors have redundant or cooperative functions for the development of a stable and mature vascular system during embryonic development.

A global deletion of the S1P1 receptor in mice results in lethality beginning at E12.5 due to severe hemorrhage as the result of deficient coverage of vessels by vascular smooth muscle cells, a process that occurs during the last stages of angiogenesis and is necessary for stabilizing the vascular system (14Liu Y.

Through analysis of endothelial cell-specific S1P1 receptor knock-out mice, we have shown that the S1P1 receptor functions within endothelial cells to regulate vascular smooth muscle cell coverage (24Allende M.L.

The function of the S1P1 receptor in the developing vasculature is also essential for proper limb development (25Chae S.S. Paik J.H. Allende M.L. Proia R.L. Hla T. Dev. Biol. 2004; 268: 441-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Deletion of the S1P1 receptor in T-cells has revealed a critical role in lymphocyte trafficking (26Allende M.L. Dreier J.L.

To uncover functions that might be masked by redundancy, we produced mice carrying different combinations of the deleted S1P1, S1P2, and S1P3 receptor genes. Indeed, this analysis indicates that these three receptors function coordinately to promote vessel stability during embryonic angiogenesis. Generation of S1P2 and S1P3 Null Mice—Genomic fragments containing the entire open reading frames of the S1P2 and S1P3 genes were cloned from a 129/Sv mouse genomic library. To construct the S1P2 targeting vector, a 4.8-kb cassette containing a neomycin-resistant gene (30Nehls M. Kyewski B. Messerle M. Waldschutz R. Schuddekopf K. Smith A.J. Boehm T. Science. 1996; 272: 886-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) was inserted into an EcoRV site within the open reading frame in an orientation opposite of the S1P2 gene (Fig. 1A). For the S1P3 targeting vector, a 2-kb neomycin-resistant cassette (31Capecchi M.R. Science. 1989; 244: 1288-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar) was inserted between an upstream intronic BglII site and a NcoI site in the coding region in the same orientation of the S1P3 gene, which resulted in a 1.5-kb genomic deletion (Fig. 1C). Gene targeting in TC1 embryonic stem (ES) cells and the generation of chimeric and heterozygous mice was accomplished as described previously (32Liu Y. Wada R. Kawai H. Sango K. Deng C. Tai T.

The null mice were maintained on a mixed C57Bl/6, 129/Sv background. The S1P2 null mice were genotyped by Southern blotting using probe A and by PCR using the following three primers (Fig. 1A): primer 1, 5′-GCAGTGACAAAAGCTGCCGAATGCTGATG-3′; primer 2, 5′-AGATGGTGACCACGCAGAGCACGTAGTG-3′; and primer 3, 5′-TGACCGCTTCCTCGTGCTTTACGGTATCG-3′. Primers 1 and 2 detected the wild-type S1P2 allele and amplified an ∼170-bp fragment. Primers 1 and 3 detected the targeted S1P2 allele and amplified an ∼220-bp fragment (Fig. 1B, bottom). Forty cycles of 94 °C (1 min), 55 °C (1 min), and 72 °C (1 min) were used. The S1P3 genotypes were determined by Southern blot analysis using probe B and by PCR using the following three primers (Fig. 1C): primer 4, 5′-TCAGTATCTTCACCGCCATT-3′; primer 5, 5′-AATCACTACGGTCCGCAGAA-3′; and primer 6, 5′-GTGCAATCCATCTTGTTCAAT-3′. Primers 4 and 5 detected the wild-type S1P3 allele and amplified an ∼130-bp fragment. Primers 5 and 6 detected the targeted S1P3 allele and amplified an ∼380-bp fragment (Fig. 1D, bottom).

Embryos were obtained from timed pregnant females with the morning of the vaginal plug considered to be embryonic day (E) 0.5 (E0.5). Time-mated female S1P1+/–S1P2–/– mice were relatively inefficient in producing litters. To obtain sufficient numbers of embryos for genotyping we also time mated female S1P1+/–S1P2+/– mice with male S1P1+/–S1P2–/– mice (Table IV).Table IVAnalysis of offspring from S1P1+/- S1P2+/- (female) × S1P1+/- S1P2-/- (male) crossesS1P1+/+ S1P2+/-S1P1+/+ S1P2-/-S1P1+/- S1P2+/-S1P1+/- S1P2-/-S1P1-/- S1P2+/-S1P1-/- S1P2-/-E9.5972119 (1)11 (1)6E10.519 (3)1435 (3)23 (1)13 (2)20 (6)E11.51014 (1)18 (2)28 (2)9 (1)8 (2)E12.516 (1)11 (2)30 (1)248 (2)10 (9)E13.52110203 (3) Open table in a new tab Northern Analysis—Total RNA was prepared from mouse brain, heart, and lung using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Lung RNA was further purified using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). Total RNA (20 μg) was fractionated on denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gels (1%) and then transferred to positively charged nylon membranes (GeneScreen Plus; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The membranes were prehybridized in PerfectHyb Plus (Sigma) with 0.1 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA at 68 °C for 1 h. Hybridization was performed overnight at 68 °C with 32P-labeled DNA probes prepared by the random priming method. The coding region of mouse S1P1, rat S1P2, and human S1P3 cDNAs were used as probes. The membranes were washed in 2× SSC 0.1% SDS at 25 °C for 5 min and in 0.2× SSC 0.1% SDS at 50 °C for 5 min, 55 °C for 5 min, 60 °C for 5 min, and 65 °C for 5 min. Histological Analysis—Embryos at E9.5–E18.5 were obtained after timed mating. The embryos were fixed and embedded in paraffin. Serial sections (5-μm thick) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. For immunostaining, the paraffin sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated. Antigen retrieval was accomplished by a 30-min incubation at 95 °C in Target Retrieval Solution (DAKO Corp.). Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by incubation with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 5 min. The specimens were incubated with anti-smooth muscle α-actin (U7033; DAKO Corp.) at room temperature for 1 h. After washing with PBS, the peroxidase reaction was visualized with diaminobenzidine/hydrogen peroxide. For whole-mount embryo immunostaining, embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C overnight. The embryos were dehydrated through a methanol series, and endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by incubation with 5% hydrogen peroxide in methanol at room temperature for 4 h. The embryos were rehydrated through a methanol series to PBS and incubated in 4% BSA in PBS plus 0.1% Triton X-100 (PBST) at room temperature for 1 h twice. The embryos were incubated with rat anti-CD31 (PECAM-1) monoclonal antibody (clone MEC13.3; PharMingen) and diluted 1:10 in 4% BSA in PBST at 4 °C overnight. Embryos were washed with 4% BSA in PBST at 4 °C for 1 h five times and then incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) diluted 1:100 in 4% BSA in PBST at 4 °C overnight. After washing with 4% BSA in PBST at 4 °C for 1 h five times and 0.2% BSA in PBST at room temperature for 1 h, the peroxidase reaction was visualized with diaminobenzidine/hydrogen peroxide. For electron microscopy, E14.5 embryos were fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde/4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 24 h. Selected regions were postfixed with 1% osmium tetrahydroxide and processed for embedding in plastic resin. Semithin sections were cut, stained with toluidine blue, and examined. Selected areas were further thin sectioned, stained with uranylacetate and lead citrate, and examined by electron microscopy (Philips EM 410). Generation of S1P2 and S1P3 Receptor Null Mice—The S1P2 and S1P3 genes were each targeted by homologous recombination in TC1 ES cells (Fig. 1). In the targeted S1P2 ES cell line, the wild-type S1P2 allele and the recombined S1P2 allele were detected by Southern blot analysis as 12-kb and 7.5-kb bands, respectively (Fig. 1B, top). In the targeted S1P3 ES cell line, the wild-type S1P3 allele and the recombined S1P3 allele were identified as 13-kb and 3-kb bands, respectively, on Southern blots (Fig. 1D, top). These targeted ES cell lines were used to produce chimeric mice that transmitted the targeted alleles to their offspring, resulting in heterozygous mice. The heterozygotes were interbred to generate homozygous S1P2 and S1P3 null mice. To confirm that the gene targeting procedures caused inactivation of the targeted loci, Northern blot analysis was performed using total RNA purified from the adult brain, heart, and lung of homozygous S1P2 and S1P3 mutant mice (Fig. 2). In the tissues of the S1P2 mutant mice the normal S1P2 transcript was not detected, whereas the S1P1 and S1P3 transcripts were present at normal levels. Likewise, the S1P3 transcript was absent in tissues from the S1P3 mutant mice without a significant difference in the expression of the other widely expressed receptor genes, S1P1 and S1P2. These results indicate that the targeting procedures resulted in null alleles for S1P2 and S1P3. Analysis of S1P1 S1P2 Double Null, S1P1 S1P3 Double Null, and S1P1 S1P2 S1P3 Triple Null Embryos—Consistent with previous studies on independently generated lines of S1P2 and S1P3 null mice, we found no evidence of generalized embryonic lethality in either of our lines of null mice (28Ishii I. Friedman B. Ye X. Kawamura S. McGiffert C. Contos J.J. Kingsbury M.A. Zhang G. Brown J.H. Chun J. J. Biol.

We determined whether the additional deletion of the S1P2 gene or the S1P3 gene could influence the embryonic phenotype produced by the absence of the S1P1 gene by performing crosses with mice carrying mutations in multiple S1P receptors. As has been shown in the absence of S1P1 alone, E12.5 embryos show bleeding along the body and head due to a defect in vascular maturation (Figs. 3B and 4A), leading to their death by E13.5–E14.5 (Table II and Fig. 4B) (14Liu Y. Wada R. Yamashita T. Mi Y. Deng C.X. Hobson J.P. Rosenfeldt H.M. Nava V.E. Chae S.S. Lee M.J. Liu C.H. Hla T. Spiegel S. Proia R.L. J. Clin.

Biol. 2004; 268: 441-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The phenotype of the S1P1 S1P3 double null embryos appeared similar to embryos with a single S1P1 gene deletion or perhaps marginally more severe, with most of the S1P1 S1P3 double null embryos alive at E12.5 (Table V and Fig. 4B) showing bleeding along the body and head together with underdeveloped limbs (Figs. 3D and 4A). Most of these S1P1 S1P3 double null embryos expired slightly sooner than the S1P1 single null embryos. These results indicated that the additional S1P3 gene deletion has, at most, a minor influence on the S1P1 null phenotype.Fig. 4Frequency of hemorrhage and death for S1P receptor null embryos. A, percentage of S1P receptor null genotypes showing abnormal embryonic bleeding. B, percentage of S1P receptor null genotypes showing embryonic death. Death was judged by the absence of a heartbeat.

At E12.5 just two of fifteen embryos with deletions in both the S1P1 and the S1P2 genes were alive as judged by a beating heart (Tables III and IV and Fig. 4B). These double null embryos started to display hemorrhage as early as E10.5 (Figs. 3F and 4A).Table IIIAnalysis of offspring from S1P1+/- S1P2-/- intercrossesS1P1+/+ S1P2-/-S1P1+/- S1P2-/-S1P1-/- S1P2-/-E9.5614 (1)9 (1)E10.56 (1)15 (2)4 (1)E11.58 (2)19 (1)17 (7)E12.537 (1)5 (4) Open table in a new tab Finally, we were able to examine a limited number of embryos with all three genes, S1P1, S1P2, and S1P3, deleted. Only one of five triple null embryos was found to be alive at E11.5 (Table VI and Fig. 4B), and we did not find any survivors at E12.5 (data not shown). About 50% of the triple null embryos showed bleeding at E10.5 (Fig. 4A). This triple null phenotype was similar to or perhaps slightly more severe than the S1P1 S1P2 double null embryos.Table VIAnalysis of offspring from S1P1+/- S1P2-/- S1P3-/- intercrossesS1P1+/+ S1P2-/- S1P3-/-S1P1+/- S1P2-/- S1P3-/-S1P1-/- S1P2-/- S1P3-/-E9.5232E10.56 (1)5 (1)4 (1)E11.5145 (4) Open table in a new tab Immature Vascular Network in S1P1 S1P2 Double Null, and S1P1 S1P2 S1P3 Triple Null Embryos—The early demise of the S1P1 S1P2 double null and S1P1 S1P2 S1P3 triple null embryos was coincident with a bleeding phenotype, suggesting that vascular abnormalities were a cause of death. We assessed vascular development by performing whole-mount immunohistochemical staining using a rat anti-CD31 (PECAM-1) monoclonal antibody. The staining indicated a substantial development of the vascular network in the double and triple null embryos at E10.5 (Fig. 5, A, C, E, and G). However, close examination of the head region revealed a less mature appearing vasculature. In this area in the double and triple null embryos, the capillary network was less developed and contained fewer branches when compared with the wild-type embryos and the S1P1 null embryos (Fig. 5, B, D, F, and H). Analysis of S1P2 S1P3 Double Null Mice—We obtained viable S1P2 S1P3 double null mice by interbreeding double heterozygous mice. However, it was difficult to obtain viable offspring through interbreeding these S1P2 S1P3 double null mice. Generally, the litters derived from these mice were spontaneously aborted late in pregnancy or, rarely, a small number of pups were delivered. These results are in basic agreement with those of Ishii et al. who described very low numbers of viable offspring and perinatal lethality after interbreeding S1P2–/– S1P3–/– mice (29Ishii I. Ye X. Friedman B. Kawamura S. Contos J.J. Kingsbury M.A. Yang A.H. Zhang G. Brown J.H. Chun J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25152-25159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). We examined the genotypes of the viable offspring from S1P2+/– S1P3–/– intercrosses 4 weeks after birth and found that only 11% were of the genotype S1P2–/– S1P3–/– instead of the expected 25% (Table VII). After timed matings we found a similarly depressed frequency of S1P2–/– S1P3–/– embryos at E18.5, indicating that lethality was occurring prior to this time (Table VII). The expected frequency of the S1P2 S1P3 double null embryos was obtained between E13.5 and E16.5. However, substantially more of these double null embryos were found without a heartbeat as compared with the two other genotypes, S1P2+/+ S1P3–/– and S1P2+/– S1P3–/–, present in the litters (Table VII). Furthermore, a substantial fraction of viable double null embryos showed a bleeding phenotype (Figs. 4A and 6), suggesting that a vascular defect was the cause of the embryonic lethality. Hemorrhage was not observed in the S1P3 single null embryos in these same litters. Moreover, after timed mating of the S1P2 single null mice we determined that S1P2 embryos did not show abnormal bleeding or death during this same gestational period (data not shown).Table VIIAnalysis of offspring from S1P2+/- S1P3-/- intercrossesS1P2+/+ S1P3-/-S1P2+/- S1P3-/-S1P2-/- S1P3-/-E12.59176E13.515(1)3315 (2)E14.5620 (1)7 (2)E15.5-16.5162818 (1)E18.518296P2826388 Open table in a new tab Abnormal Endothelial Cells in the S1P2 S1P3 Double Null Embryos—The S1P2 S1P3 double null embryos began to hemorrhage around E13.5. Transverse sections of E13.5 S1P2 S1P3 double null embryos showed free red blood cells and edema in subcutaneous areas (Fig. 7B). The aorta in the S1P2 S1P3 double null embryos appeared to be covered normally by vascular smooth muscle cells, unlike the defective coverage of the aortae in S1P1 null mice (14Liu Y. Wada R.

Electron microscopic analysis of microvessels from S1P2 S1P3 double null embryos revealed endothelial cells with abnormally thin cell bodies (Fig. 7C), which, in some cases, were broken (Fig. 7, C and D).

Scale bars, 50 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In the embryo, the vasculature develops through the sequential processes of vasculogenesis and angiogenesis (33Conway E.M. Collen D. Carmeliet P. Cardiovasc. Res. 2001; 49: 507-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar, 34Lindahl P. Hellstrom M. Kalen M. Betsholtz C. Curr. Opin.

Beginning at around E8.5 in the mouse, vasculogenesis includes the differentiation of endothelial cells, their migration and proliferation, and the formation of the primitive vascular plexus. The subsequent process of angiogenesis, initiating at about E10.5, involves the sprouting, splitting, and remodeling of existing vessels to generate a more complex, tree-like network of highly branched small and large vessels. As part of the angiogenic process, maturation of vessels occurs as the endothelial tubes are invested with vascular smooth muscle cells to provide support and stability for the nascent vascular network. Maturation of vessels extends late into gestation. The S1P1 receptor within endothelial cells is required for the coverage of vessels by vascular smooth muscle cells (24Allende M.L. Yamashita T. Proia R.L. Blood. 2003; 102: 3665-3667Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). In the absence of the S1P1 receptor, lethality occurs at E12.5–E14.5 due to rupture of the unreinforced vessels (14Liu Y. Wada R. Yamashita T. Mi Y. Deng C.X. Hobson J.P. Rosenfeldt H.M. Nava V.E. Chae S.S. Lee M.J. Liu C.H. Hla T. Spiegel S. Proia R.L. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 951-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar). Unlike the embryonic lethality caused by the absence of the S1P1 receptor, mice null for either the S1P2 or the S1P3 receptor, the two other widely expressed S1P receptors, were viable and fertile and showed normal cage behavior (Table VIII). These findings are in basic accord with observations of independently generated S1P2 and S1P3 null mice that were reported by Ishii et al. (28Ishii I. Friedman B. Ye X. Kawamura S. McGiffert C.

We did not observe the frequent spontaneous seizure behavior that has been described in the third S1P2 null line (36MacLennan A.J. Carney P.R. Zhu W.J. Chaves A.H. Garcia J. Grimes J.R. Anderson K.J. Roper S.N. Lee N. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 14: 203-209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which may be related to strain differences or differences in targeting procedures.Table VIIIViability of S1P receptor null miceS1P1 nullEmbryonic lethal at E12.5-14.5S1P2 nullViableS1P3 nullViableS1P1/S1P2 nullEmbryonic lethal at E10.5-12.5S1P1/S1P3 nullEmbryonic lethal at E12.5-13.5S1P2/S1P3 nullPartial embryonic lethality after E13.5S1P1/S1P2/S1P3 nullEmbryonic lethal at E10.5-11.5 Open table in a new tab Because the S1P2 and S1P3 receptors, like the S1P1 receptor, are expressed in embryonic endothelial cells (10McGiffert C. Contos J.J. Friedman B. Chun J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), we determined whether they might have a cooperative or a redundant function with the S1P1 receptor by crossbreeding the null mice. We found that an additional deletion of the S1P3 gene did not substantially alter the phenotype of the S1P1 single null embryos. By contrast, the phenotype of the S1P1 S1P2 double null embryos was distinctly more severe with bleeding and lethality occurring about 2 days earlier than in the S1P1 single null embryos. The phenotype of the S1P1 S1P2 S1P3 triple null embryos was similar to or slightly more severe than that of the S1P1 S1P2 double null embryos. In the triple null embryos, PECAM-1 staining indicated that the vascular system had substantially formed. This result shows that the S1P1, S1P2, and S1P3 receptors are largely dispensable for the process of embryonic vasculogenesis. However, vascular defects were apparent in the heads of S1P1 S1P2 S1P3 triple null and S1P1 S1P2 double null embryos. Here the vessels appeared less mature than in the S1P1 null or wild-type embryos, indicating that the S1P1 and S1P2 receptors were required for some aspects of vessel development during angiogenesis. Such a vascular defect could contribute to the more severe phenotype observed in the double and triple null mice. Perinatal lethality had been described previously for S1P2 S1P3 double null mice (29Ishii I. Ye X. Friedman B. Kawamura S. Contos J.J. Kingsbury M.A. Yang A.H. Zhang G. Brown J.H. Chun J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25152-25159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). We found that the S1P2 S1P3 double null mice were born at about one-half of the expected frequency with a higher rate of embryonic death, after E13.5, compared with the other genotypes in the same litters. Thus, the observed inability of the S1P2 S1P3 double null intercrosses to produce viable offspring may be the result of the high frequency of late stage embryonic lethality that could lead to the termination of the entire pregnancy. Hemorrhage was coincident with and may also be the cause of the lethality for S1P2 S1P3 double null embryos. Histological examination of the S1P2 S1P3 double null embryos revealed bleeding and edema in the subcutaneous regions. Ultrastructural analysis of microvessels in the S1P2 S1P3 double null mice showed that the endothelial cells appeared to be abnormal with thin cell bodies, suggesting that these vessels may be fragile and prone to rupture. The S1P1 receptor is believed to couple exclusively to a Gi signaling pathway, whereas the S1P2 and S1P3 receptors couple to Gi as well as to the Gq and G12/13 pathways (Table I). The overlap in these signaling pathways suggests that redundancy of function of the three S1P receptors is possible and may explain the generally increased phenotypic severity when multiple receptors were deleted. Alternatively, vessel development may require the integration of distinct cellular activities derived from individual S1P receptors. For instance, S1P1 and S1P3 receptors have been shown to stimulate Rac-coupled cortical actin assembly and Rho-coupled stress fiber formation, respectively (37Lee M.J. Thangada S. Claffey K.P. Ancellin N. Liu C.H. Kluk M. Volpi M. Sha'afi R.I. Hla T. Cell. 1999; 99: 301-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). S1P2 and S1P3 receptors both mediate sphingosine-1-phosphate stimulation of Rho, yet the S1P2 but not the S1P3 receptor mediates down-regulation of Rac activation, membrane ruffling, and cell migration (38Takuwa Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). A major physiologic function for S1P receptor signaling was revealed in the S1P1 null embryos, which demonstrated that the S1P1 receptor functions within endothelial cells to promote their interactions with smooth muscle cells. In addition to stabilizing the vasculature, endothelial smooth muscle cell interactions are required for vessel remodeling. Mice lacking endoglin and myocardin are deficient in smooth muscle cells and show defects in vascular remodeling, including the growth and sprouting of endothelial tubes (39Li D.Y. Sorensen L.K. Brooke B.S. Urness L.D. Davis E.C. Taylor D.G. Boak B.B. Wendel D.P. Science. 1999; 284: 1534-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar, 40Li S. Wang D.Z. Wang Z. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9366-9370Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The vessel defects seen in the double and triple null mice may be the result of a more severe block in endothelial cell smooth muscle cell interactions than that which occurs in the single null S1P1 embryos. Alternatively, a more direct effect on angiogenesis is possible. In either case, the vascular phenotypes of embryos with deleted S1P1, S1P2, and S1P3 genes (Table VIII) support the concept that these S1P receptors coordinate the transition from a leaky immature vascular network to a mature stable system in embryonic development and, possibly, in adults.

Accordingly, the deletion of APE1, ATG19, or ATG11 affected the formation of Cvt vesicles. These observations suggest a unique concept; in the case of the Cvt pathway, the cargo proteins facilitate receptor recruitment and vesicle formation rather than the situation with most vesicular transport, in which the forming vesicle concentrates the cargo proteins.

The process of the Cvt pathway and autophagy are topologically and mechanistically similar, even though they are different in their physiological functions (3Takeshige K. Baba M. Tsuboi S. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar, 4Baba M. Osumi M. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. J.

Autophagy is a cellular process responsible for the non-selective bulk degradation of cytoplasmic components in eukaryotic cells, which is induced in response to environmental cues such as nutrient starvation and hormonal stimuli (6Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 7Klionsky D.J. Emr S.D. Science. 2000; 290: 1717-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (3014) Google Scholar). In yeast, nutrient starvation induces the formation of autophagosomes, which are much larger (300–900 nm in diameter) than Cvt vesicles (150 nm in diameter), for efficient transport of cytoplasm to the vacuole. On the other hand, the Cvt pathway is a constitutive biosynthetic pathway highly specific for prApe1 and Ams1. The cargo specificity in the Cvt pathway is conferred by Atg19/Cvt19 that has been characterized as a cargo receptor (8Scott S.V. Guan J. Hutchins M.U. Kim J. Klionsky D.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1131-1141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Recently, we elucidated the mechanism of cargo selection in the Cvt pathway (9Shintani T. Huang W.-P. Stromhaug P.E. Klionsky D.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 825-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Two independent processes contributed to the selective incorporation of prApe1 into the Cvt vesicle: the self-assembly of the prApe1 complex, and its recruitment to the perivacuolar vesicle-forming site called the pre-autophagosomal structure (PAS). After synthesis of the prApe1 polypeptide, it rapidly forms dodecamers in the cytosol (10Kim J. Scott S.V. Oda M.N. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 609-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), which further assemble into a higher order structure termed the Ape1 complex; assembly of the Ape1 complex is dependent on the prApe1 propeptide. The Ape1 complex recruits Atg19 through the interaction between the propeptide of prApe1 and a coiled-coil motif of Atg19. Atg11/Cvt9 then binds to the C terminus of Atg19 to target the cargo-receptor complex to the PAS, where the interactions between Atg19 and PAS components ensure the incorporation of the cargo complex into the Cvt vesicle (9Shintani T. Huang W.-P. Stromhaug P.E. Klionsky D.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 825-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Unlike most receptors that cycle between donor and acceptor membranes, Atg19 is targeted to the vacuole together with cargo proteins and degraded there. The simultaneous binding of another cargo molecule, Ams1, to Atg19 results in an accumulation of Ams1 on the Ape1 complex, allowing an efficient transport of Ams1 to the vacuole. Interestingly, the lack of an Ape1 complex resulted in a dramatic decrease in the turnover of Atg19 as well as a decrease of Ams1 transport to the vacuole (8Scott S.V. Guan J. Hutchins M.U. Kim J. Klionsky D.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1131-1141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 9Shintani T. Huang W.-P. Stromhaug P.E. Klionsky D.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 825-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), suggesting that the Ape1 complex facilitates the incorporation of an Atg19-Ams1 complex into the Cvt vesicles. Because the turnover of Atg19 is dependent on Cvt vesicle formation (8Scott S.V. Guan J. Hutchins M.U. Kim J. Klionsky D.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1131-1141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), these results raised a question as to whether the Cvt cargo could also induce Cvt vesicle formation or whether vesicle formation was constitutive and empty vesicles could be formed even without cargo proteins. The role of cargo proteins in facilitating or directing vesicle formation has been difficult to study because in most vesicular trafficking events the full range of cargo molecules have not been defined; in the Cvt pathway, prApe1 appears to be the predominant cargo protein, and even Ams1 is a relatively minor constituent. Even though the Ape1 complex is selectively incorporated into autophagosomes under starvation conditions, neither Ape1 nor Atg19 is required for autophagy (8Scott S.V. Guan J. Hutchins M.U. Kim J. Klionsky D.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1131-1141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 11Suzuki K. Kamada Y. Ohsumi Y. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 815-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), suggesting that autophagosome formation does not depend on the presence of specific cargo components. In this study, we show that the cargo-receptor complex facilitates the formation of Cvt vesicles but not autophagosomes.

The cultures were divided into two tubes, and either rapamycin (0.2 μg/ml) or the drug vehicle was added to each tube. After incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, the tubes were placed at 30 °C to activate the Cvt pathway or autophagy. At various time points, 1 ml of culture was harvested and used to prepare a protein extract. Protein extracts equivalent to A600 = 0.1 unit of yeast cells were subjected to SDS-PAGE and probed with anti-Ape1 antiserum and anti-GFP antibody (Covance Research Products, Berkeley, CA). Fluorescence Microscopy—Yeast cells expressing fluorescent proteinfused chimeras were grown in SCD medium to mid-log phase. For nitrogen starvation, the cells grown in SCD medium were washed with water twice and resuspended in SD(–N) medium. The cells were observed with a fluorescence microscope as described previously (14Kim J. Huang W.-P. Stromhaug P.E. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 763-773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Atg8 Can Be Used to Trace Cvt Vesicle Formation—Atg19 is a receptor protein for the vacuolar hydrolases Ape1 and Ams1 in the Cvt pathway. It is transported to the vacuole together with cargo proteins and degraded within the vacuole lumen. Previously, we found that the turnover of Atg19 and the transport of Ams1 were severely affected by a lack of Ape1 (9Shintani T. Huang W.-P. Stromhaug P.E. Klionsky D.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 825-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Because both Atg19 turnover and Ams1 transport are also dependent on the proper function of the Cvt pathway, we asked whether the Ape1 complex could induce the formation of Cvt vesicles or whether empty vesicles could be formed without the Ape1 complex. To analyze the effect of a lack of cargo complex on the formation of Cvt vesicles, we needed to develop a suitable marker protein. Precursor Ape1 is the standard marker used to monitor delivery via the Cvt and autophagy pathways; however, we were unable to use Ape1 as a marker because our goal was to examine vesicle formation in the absence of this specific cargo protein. Among the characterized Atg proteins, only Atg19 and Atg8/Aut7 remain associated with the completed Cvt vesicle/autophagosome. Atg19 was not suitable as a marker protein because it functions in cargo recognition. Accordingly, we used Atg8 as a marker of the Cvt pathway. Atg8 is essential for Cvt vesicle formation and for expansion of the autophagosome membrane (15Kirisako T. Baba M. Ishihara N. Miyazawa K. Ohsumi M. Yoshimori T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 16Huang W.-P. Scott S.V. Kim J. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5845-5851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 17Abeliovich H. Dunn Jr., W.A. Kim J. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1025-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Similar to Atg19, Atg8 is delivered to the vacuole as a component of the Cvt vesicle/autophagosome and is degraded after breakdown of the inner vesicle within the vacuole lumen. Accordingly, Cvt vesicle/autophagosome formation can be assessed by measuring the amount of Atg8 protein delivered to the vacuole. Using Atg8 to monitor vesicle formation, however, presented a significant problem for analyzing the Cvt pathway; Atg8 is synthesized at very low levels under vegetative conditions and is only induced upon starvation. Accordingly, it is problematic to monitor delivery of Atg8 under vegetative conditions through a radioactive pulse/chase analysis; the level of protein delivered to the vacuole is too low to allow an accurate quantification, and it is inherently difficult to follow the kinetics of vacuolar delivery by examining loss of a protein. Because of these technical difficulties, we designed an alternate strategy to monitor vesicle formation. GFP tagging of Atg8 has been used to trace the process of the Cvt pathway and autophagy (12Suzuki K. Kirisako T. Kamada Y. Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5971-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 18Kim J. Huang W.-P. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 51-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Even though Atg8 is subject to degradation upon vacuolar delivery, the relative stability of GFP to the activity of vacuolar hydrolases led us to propose that the GFP moiety would accumulate in the vacuolar lumen as a consequence of the transport of GFP-Atg8 to the vacuole; the accumulated GFP could be easily monitored and would reflect delivery of Atg8. To confirm the suitability of this approach, we performed immunoblot analysis of GFP-Atg8 using anti-GFP antibody. In wild type cells expressing GFP-Atg8 grown in rich medium, we detected protein bands of 40 and 26 kDa (Fig. 1A, bottom panel). These molecular masses correspond to the predicted sizes of full-length GFP-Atg8 and free GFP. As controls, we examined atg1Δ/agp1Δ and pep4Δ strains, which are defective in Cvt vesicle/autophagosome formation and the breakdown of intravacuolar vesicles, respectively. In contrast to the result seen in wild type cells, only full-length GFP-Atg8 was seen in the mutant strains (Fig. 1A, bottom panel). These results indicated that the generation of free GFP was dependent on the proper function of the Cvt pathway. When autophagy was induced by incubating the cells in starvation medium, the transport of GFP-Atg8 was enhanced in wild type cells, whereas again no liberation of GFP was observed in atg1Δ or pep4Δ mutant cells (Fig. 1A, bottom panel). These results support the idea that an increased level of Atg8 is required to form autophagosomes (17Abeliovich H. Dunn Jr., W.A. Kim J. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1025-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). An analysis of Ape1 from the same protein extracts verified that the mutant strains displayed the expected phenotypes with regard to prApe1 processing (Fig. 1A, top panel). To allow a kinetic analysis of GFP-Atg8 transport, we took advantage of a conditional atg1 mutant. Cells harboring a temperature-sensitive allele of ATG1, atg1ts, and expressing GFP-Atg8 were grown to mid-log phase at non-permissive temperature and then shifted to permissive temperature to activate the Cvt pathway, followed by immunoblot analysis with anti-Ape1 antiserum and anti-GFP antibody. After shifting to the permissive temperature, prApe1 was converted to the mature form (mApe1) within 1 h, indicating that prApe1 reached the vacuole immediately after the atg1ts block was released (Fig. 1B, top left, top panel). Similarly, the conversion of GFP-Atg8 to GFP occurred within 1 h after incubation at 30 °C, and accumulation of GFP gradually increased during the time course (Fig. 1B, top left, bottom panel). The addition of rapamycin to the culture, which mimics nutrient starvation conditions, resulted in an enhanced transport of GFP-Atg8 to the vacuole (Fig. 1B, top left, bottom panel). These results confirmed that this system is useful for a kinetic analysis of Cvt vesicle/autophagosome formation. Absence of the Cvt Cargo-Receptor Complex Impairs Cvt Vesicle but Not Autophagosome Formation—To investigate whether the Cvt cargo complex is involved in Cvt vesicle formation, we carried out kinetic analyses using an atg1ts ape1Δ double mutant strain expressing GFP-Atg8. After growth at 37 °C, the cells were shifted to 30 °C to activate the Cvt pathway. In the absence of rapamycin treatment, the generation of free GFP was severely delayed up to 4 h after incubation at 30 °C, suggesting that prApe1 is required for proper or efficient Cvt vesicle formation (Fig. 1B, bottom left, bottom panel). The receptor protein Atg19 is concentrated on the Ape1 complex and behaves like an adaptor protein to connect the Ape1 complex and the vesicle forming machinery; the Atg19-Ape1 complex is termed the Cvt complex. Thus, we hypothesized that Atg19 might be also important for Cvt vesicle formation. To test this, we carried out the same analysis with an atg1ts atg19Δ strain. As expected, GFP-Atg8 transport was delayed in this strain and showed kinetics similar to that seen in the atg1ts ape1Δ strain (Fig. 1B, top right, bottom panel). These results suggested that the cargo-receptor complex induces the formation of the Cvt vesicle rather than being incorporated within a constitutively forming vesicle. In contrast to the block in Cvt vesicle formation seen in rich medium, the deletion of either APE1 or ATG19 did not affect autophagosome formation when cells were treated with rapamycin to induce autophagy (Fig. 1B, bottom left and top right, bottom panels). This result was consistent with previous observations obtained by using autophagy-dependent activation of alkaline phosphatase activity (8Scott S.V. Guan J. Hutchins M.U. Kim J. Klionsky D.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1131-1141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 11Suzuki K. Kamada Y. Ohsumi Y. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 815-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). It is believed that Cvt vesicles and autophagosomes are formed at the PAS, where most of the Atg proteins localize (11Suzuki K. Kamada Y. Ohsumi Y. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 815-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 12Suzuki K. Kirisako T. Kamada Y. Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y.

Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 231-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The Cvt complex also localizes to this structure (9Shintani T. Huang W.-P. Stromhaug P.E. Klionsky D.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 825-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 11Suzuki K. Kamada Y. Ohsumi Y. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 815-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To examine whether proper localization of the cargo-receptor complex to the PAS is also important for vesicle formation, we constructed an atg1ts atg11Δ/cvt9Δ strain expressing GFP-Atg8. Atg11/Cvt9 is a specific factor for the Cvt pathway and pexophagy (20Kim J. Kamada Y. Stromhaug P.E. Guan J. Hefner-Gravink A. Baba M. Scott S.V. Ohsumi Y. Dunn Jr., W.A. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 381-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) and is required to localize the cargo-receptor complex to the PAS in the Cvt pathway (9Shintani T. Huang W.-P. Stromhaug P.E. Klionsky D.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 825-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). In this strain, no transport of GFP-Atg8 was observed without rapamycin treatment, whereas with rapamycin the transport of GFP-Atg8 was comparable with that of other strains including the wild type (Fig. 1B). This result suggested that cargo recruitment to the PAS was also important for Cvt vesicle formation but not for autophagosome formation. Examination of Ape1 again confirmed the expected phenotype of the various strains. In particular, prApe1 was absent in the ape1Δ strain, showed normal maturation in the atg1ts strain at the permissive temperature, accumulated in the absence of Atg19, and was partially matured in the atg11Δ strain only under starvation conditions (Fig. 1B, top panels). The Cvt Complex Is Important for PAS Organization under Growing Conditions—The PAS is thought to be an organizing center for Cvt vesicle/autophagosome formation based on several lines of evidence: (i) most of the Atg proteins are located at the PAS under both growing and starvation conditions (12Suzuki K. Kirisako T. Kamada Y. Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5971-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 14Kim J. Huang W.-P. Stromhaug P.E. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol.

Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 231-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar); (ii) the localization of some Atg proteins at the PAS is dependent on the function of other Atg proteins (12Suzuki K. Kirisako T. Kamada Y. Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5971-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 13Shintani T. Suzuki K. Kamada Y. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol.

Cell. 2001; 12: 3821-3838Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar); and (iii) GFP-Atg8 transiently localizes at the PAS and is then transported to the vacuole (12Suzuki K. Kirisako T. Kamada Y. Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5971-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 14Kim J. Huang W.-P. Stromhaug P.E. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 763-773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we decided to examine the effect of depletion of the cargo complex on the organization of the PAS. First, we examined the localization of GFP-Atg8 under growing conditions. In a wild type strain, 25% of the cells contained a single GFP-Atg8 punctate signal or a few GFP-Atg8 punctate signals at the PAS (Fig. 2). In contrast, the PAS localization of GFP-Atg8 was observed in only 6.0% and 2.5% of ape1Δ and atg19Δ cells, respectively (Fig. 2). The atg11Δ strain also showed a severe defect in GFP-Atg8 localization at the PAS; only 3.3% of the cells had punctate signals of GFP-Atg8 (Fig. 2). These results suggested that the cargo-receptor complex and its recruitment to the PAS were required for the proper localization of Atg8 at the PAS under growing conditions. On the other hand, these mutant strains did not show any difference in GFP-Atg8 localization compared with the wild type strain under starvation conditions; most of the cells displayed GFP staining in their vacuoles, and about 75–90% of the cells showed a punctate dot of GFP-Atg8 at the PAS (Fig. 2). This result was consistent with previous observations that Ape1, Atg19, and Atg11 are dispensable for autophagy (8Scott S.V. Guan J. Hutchins M.U. Kim J. Klionsky D.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1131-1141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 11Suzuki K. Kamada Y. Ohsumi Y. Dev.

Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 381-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1) and suggested that the PAS localization of Atg8 occurred independently of the recognition of the Cvt cargo under starvation conditions. It was reported that the PAS localization of Atg8 is dependent on its lipidation state (12Suzuki K. Kirisako T. Kamada Y. Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5971-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the lipidation of Atg8 in ape1Δ, atg19Δ, and atg11Δ cells and found there was no difference in lipidation between the wild type and these mutant strains (data not shown), suggesting that Atg8 still localized on some membrane structure, although it was not concentrated at the PAS in these mutant cells. Because Atg8 physically interacts with Atg19 (9Shintani T. Huang W.-P. Stromhaug P.E. Klionsky D.J. Dev.

Recently, it was reported that the PAS localization of Atg2/Apg2 is important for its function in Cvt vesicle/autophagosome formation (13Shintani T. Suzuki K. Kamada Y. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol.

Activation of σE is controlled by a proteolytic cascade that is initiated by the DegS protease. DegS senses misfolded protein in the periplasm, undergoes autoactivation, and cleaves the antisigma factor RseA. Here, we present the crystal structures of three distinct states of DegS from E. coli. DegS alone exists in a catalytically inactive form. Binding of stress-signaling peptides to its PDZ domain induces a series of conformational changes that activates protease function. Backsoaking of crystals containing the DegS-activator complex revealed the presence of an active/inactive hybrid structure and demonstrated the reversibility of activation. Taken together, the structural data illustrate in molecular detail how DegS acts as a periplasmic stress sensor. Our results suggest a novel regulatory role for PDZ domains and unveil a novel mechanism of reversible protease activation."
https://openalex.org/W2137507610,"Chromosome segregation is triggered by the cleavage of cohesins by separase. Here we show that in budding yeast separation of the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and telomeres also requires Cdc14, a protein phosphatase known for its role in mitotic exit. Cdc14 shares this role with the FEAR network, which activates Cdc14 during early anaphase, but not the mitotic exit network, which promotes Cdc14 activity during late anaphase. We further show that CDC14 is necessary and sufficient to promote condensin enrichment at the rDNA locus and to trigger rDNA segregation in a condensin-dependent manner. We propose that Cdc14 released by the FEAR network mediates the partitioning of rDNA by facilitating the localization of condensin thereto. This dual role of the FEAR network in initiating mitotic exit and promoting chromosome segregation ensures that exit from mitosis is coupled to the completion of chromosome segregation."
https://openalex.org/W2064021693,"It is known that mutations in gene SIR2 increase and those in FOB1 decrease recombination within rDNA repeats as assayed by marker loss or extrachromosomal rDNA circle formation. SIR2-dependent chromatin structures have been thought to inhibit access and/or function of recombination machinery in rDNA. We measured the frequency of FOB1-dependent arrest of replication forks, consequent DNA double-strand breaks, and formation of DNA molecules with Holliday junction structures, and found no significant difference between sir2Δ and SIR2 strains. Formal genetic experiments measuring mitotic recombination rates within individual rRNA genes also showed no significant difference between these two strains. Instead, we found a significant decrease in the association of cohesin subunit Mcd1p (Scc1p) to rDNA in sir2Δ relative to SIR2 strains. From these and other experiments, we conclude that SIR2 prevents unequal sister-chromatid recombination, probably by forming special cohesin structures, without significant effects on recombinational events within individual rRNA genes."
https://openalex.org/W2093837256,"At anaphase onset, the protease separase triggers chromosome segregation by cleaving the chromosomal cohesin complex. Here, we show that cohesin destruction in metaphase is sufficient for segregation of much of the budding yeast genome, but not of the long arm of chromosome XII that contains the rDNA repeats. rDNA in metaphase, unlike most other sequences, remains in an undercondensed and topologically entangled state. Separase, concomitantly with cleaving cohesin, activates the phosphatase Cdc14. We find that Cdc14 exerts two effects on rDNA, both mediated by the condensin complex. Lengthwise condensation of rDNA shortens the chromosome XII arm sufficiently for segregation. This condensation depends on the aurora B kinase complex. Independently of condensation, Cdc14 induces condensin-dependent resolution of cohesin-independent rDNA linkage. Cdc14-dependent sister chromatid resolution at the rDNA could introduce a temporal order to chromosome segregation."
https://openalex.org/W2034998098,"Leishmaniasis is a protozoan parasitic disease that affects 12 million people worldwide. The first line choice for the treatment of this disease is antimonial drugs. In the endemic regions, resistance to this class of drugs is a major impediment to treatment. Microbes often become resistant to drugs by mutation or down-regulation of uptake systems, but the uptake system for the antimonial drugs in Leishmania is unknown. In other organisms, aquaglyceroporins have been shown to facilitate uptake of trivalent metalloids. In this study, we report the identification and characterization of aquaglyceroporins from Leishmania major (LmAQP1) and Leishmania tarentolae (LtAQP1), respectively. These Leishmania proteins have the conserved signature motifs of aquaglyceroporins. Transfection of LmAQP1 into three species of Leishmania, L. tarentolae, Leishmania infantum, and L. major, produced hypersensitivity to both As(III) and Sb(III) in all three strains. Increased production of LmAQP1 was detected by immunoblotting. Drug-resistant parasites with various mutations leading to resistance mechanisms became hypersensitive to both metalloids after expression of LmAQP1. Increased rates of uptake of As(III) or Sb(III) correlated with metalloid sensitivity of the wild type and drug-resistant transfectants. Transfection of LmAQP1 in a Pentostam-resistant field isolate also sensitized the parasite in the macrophage-associated amastigote form. One allele of LmAQP1 was disrupted in L. major, and the resulting cells became 10-fold more resistant to Sb(III). This is the first report of the uptake of a metalloid drug by an aquaglyceroporin in Leishmania, suggesting a strategy to reverse resistance in the field.

This is the first report of the uptake of a metalloid drug by an aquaglyceroporin in Leishmania, suggesting a strategy to reverse resistance in the field. Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania sp. Leishmaniasis is a spectrum of diseases in which each disease is distinctly manifested, and all have potentially devastating consequences: disfigurement, damage to internal organs, and death (1Choi C.M. Lerner E.A. Am. J. Clin. Dermatol. 2002; 3: 91-105Google Scholar). In the last two decades, visceral leishmaniasis especially has been widely recognized as an opportunistic infection in immunocompromised patients, particularly those who are infected with human immunodeficiency virus (1Choi C.M. Lerner E.A. Am. J. Clin. Dermatol. 2002; 3: 91-105Google Scholar, 2Silva E.S. Pacheco R.S. Gontijo C.M. Carvalho I.R. Brazil R.P. Rev. Inst. Med. Trop. Sao Paulo. 2002; 44: 145-149Google Scholar). The first line choice of treatment against all forms of leishmaniasis uses drugs containing pentavalent antimony such as sodium stibogluconate (Pentostam) and meglumine antimonate (Glucantime). Clinical resistance to this class of drugs, however, has been reported from many parts of the world (3Guerin P.J. Olliaro P. Nosten F. Druilhe P. Laxminarayan R. Binka F. Kilama W.L. Ford N. White N.J. Lancet Infect. Dis. 2002; 2: 564-573Google Scholar). More than 50% of the cases of visceral leishmaniasis in Northeast India are resistant to pentavalent antimonials (4Sundar S. More D.K. Singh M.K. Singh V.P. Sharma S. Makharia A. Kumar P.C. Murray H.W. Clin. Infect. Dis. 2000; 31: 1104-1107Google Scholar). Resistance to pentavalent antimonials in Leishmania is a priority of the World Health Organization (www.who.int/infectious-disease-report/2000). Leishmania resistant to trivalent antimony has also been reported in vitro, which has provided an excellent model for the study of resistance mechanisms (5Ouellette M. Legare D. Haimeur A. Grondin K. Roy G. Brochu C. Papadopoulou B. Drug Resist. Updat. 1998; 1: 43-48Google Scholar). Although the mechanism of action of Sb(V) is still unclear, it is generally believed that Sb(V) must be reduced to Sb(III) to be effective in vivo (6Sereno D. Cavaleyra M. Zemzoumi K. Maquaire S. Ouaissi A. Lemesre J.L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 3097-3102Google Scholar). Whether Sb(V) is reduced to Sb(III) in Leishmania amastigotes or in host macrophages is controversial. In 2001, Shaked-Mishan et. al. (7Shaked-Mishan P. Ulrich N. Ephros M. Zilberstein D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3971-3976Google Scholar) reported isolating a Pentostam-resistant Leishmania donovani strain that lacks the antimoniate (Sb(V)) reduction, although no enzyme was associated with this activity. Reduction could occur enzymatically as a thiol-dependent reductase found in Leishmania (8Denton H. McGregor J.C. Coombs G.H. Biochem. J. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar), by other types of reductases as in yeast (9Mukhopadhyay R. Shi J. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21149-21157Google Scholar), or reduction could occur non-enzymatically by intracellular thiols in the parasite or host (10Ferreira Cdos S. Martins P.S. Demicheli C. Brochu C. Ouellette M. Frezard F. Biometals. 2003; 16: 441-446Google Scholar). If reduction occurs in the macrophage then the reduced form Sb(III) would have to be transported into the parasite to be effective. To date, however, no Sb(III) uptake system has been identified in Leishmania. Resistance is an interplay between uptake, efflux, and sequestration. Down-regulation of an uptake system can result in acquired resistance. Aquaglyceroporins (AQPs) 1The abbreviations used are: AQP, aquaglyceroporin; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; RLM-RACE, RNA ligase-mediated RACE. have recently been identified as uptake systems for trivalent metalloids in eukaryotes and prokaryotes (11Sanders O.I. Rensing C. Kuroda M. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3365-3367Google Scholar, 12Wysocki R. Chery C.C. Wawrzycka D. Van Hulle M. Cornelis R. Thevelein J.M. Tamas M.J. Mol.

AQPs, which are channels for small neutral solutes, are members of the aquaporin superfamily (14Tsukaguchi H. Shayakul C. Berger U.V. Mackenzie B. Devidas S. Guggino W.B. van Hoek A.N. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24737-24743Google Scholar). Mammalian AQP9 has the broadest specificity and transports water, glycerol, urea, carbamides, polyols, purines, and pyrimidines in a manner that is sensitive to phloretin and mercury (14Tsukaguchi H. Shayakul C. Berger U.V. Mackenzie B. Devidas S. Guggino W.B. van Hoek A.N. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24737-24743Google Scholar, 15Tsukaguchi H. Weremowicz S. Morton C.C. Hediger M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F685-F696Google Scholar). GlpF, an aquaglyceroporin homologue in Escherichia coli, was first identified as an uptake pathway for Sb(III) (11Sanders O.I. Rensing C. Kuroda M. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3365-3367Google Scholar). Disruption of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae FPS1 gene, which encodes an AQP homologue, similarly leads to resistance to trivalent metalloids (12Wysocki R. Chery C.C. Wawrzycka D. Van Hulle M. Cornelis R. Thevelein J.M. Tamas M.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1391-1401Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that mammalian AQP7 and AQP9 facilitate uptake of As(III) and Sb(III) when expressed in either S. cerevisiae or oocytes (13Liu Z. Shen J. Carbrey J.M. Mukhopadhyay R. Agre P. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6053-6058Google Scholar). Given that the pKa values for the hydroxides of As(III) and Sb(III) are 9.2 and 11.8, respectively, the anions arsenite and antimonite do not exist in solution at a neutral pH level. We have shown that the species present in solution is As(OH)3 (16Ramirez-Solis A. Mukopadhyay R. Rosen B.P. Stemmler T.L. Inorg. Chem. 2004; 43: 2954-2959Google Scholar), but minor polymeric species probably also exist (17Liu Z. Boles E. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17312-17318Google Scholar). The purpose of this study was two-fold. First, no aquaglyceroporin homologue has been identified in any Leishmania species. Second, the route of uptake of the activated form of the anti-Leishmania drug Pentostam is unknown. In this study we report for the first time the identification of a leishmanial homologue of the mammalian AQP9 and demonstrate that it is responsible for the uptake of trivalent antimony. LtAQP1 (GenBank™ accession number AY338876) and LmAQP1 (GenBank™ accession number AY567835) were identified from Leishmania tarentolae and Leishmania major, respectively. These exhibit 76% identity and 90% overall similarity to each other. LmAQP1 was expressed in promastigotes from three different species of Leishmania. Each of the transfectants produced substantial amounts of LmAQP1 and became hypersensitive in vitro to As(III) and Sb(III). LmAQP1 expression in a variety of As(III)- or Sb(III)-resistant mutants restored metalloid sensitivity in every strain, independently of the mechanism of resistance. The results of transport studies suggest that this hypersensitivity is caused by an increased rate of uptake of Sb(III) or As(III) in the promastigotes, consistent with increased amounts of the LmAQP1 channel. Disruption of one of the two AQP1 alleles in L. major conferred a 10-fold increase in resistance to trivalent antimony compared with the wild type. These results suggest that a major route of entry of trivalent antimony, the activated form of Pentostam, into Leishmania is catalyzed by AQP1. Importantly, the results demonstrate that a loss of AQP1 can produce resistance and that increased expression of AQP1 in drug-resistant parasites can reverse resistance. Reagents and Media—All reagents were from Sigma. As(III) and Sb(III) were purchased in the form of sodium arsenite and potassium antimonyl tartrate. DNA manipulation reagents were obtained from Qiagen and Invitrogen. Semi-defined medium 79 for growth of Leishmania promastigotes was prepared as described previously (18White T.C. Fase-Fowler F. van Luenen H. Calafat J. Borst P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16977-16983Google Scholar). Cell Lines and Cultures—All species of Leishmania were maintained in Semi-defined medium 79 at 25 °C as promastigotes. For the pathogenic species L. major (LV39) and L. infantum, the medium was supplemented with 10 μm 6-biopterin. The L. tarentolae drug-resistant mutants LtarAs50.1 (selected for resistance to As(III)) and LtarSb400.1 (selected for resistance to Sb(III)) have been described previously (19Haimeur A. Brochu C. Genest P. Papadopoulou B. Ouellette M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 108: 131-135Google Scholar, 20Ouellette M. Hettema E. Wust D. Fase-Fowler F. Borst P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1009-1016Google Scholar). The cell line LinfAs200.1 was selected in the presence of sodium arsenite by in vitro stepwise selection. This cell line grows in the presence of 150 μm arsenite and is cross-resistant to potassium antimonyl tartrate (Table I). All the transfectants were maintained in the presence of 120 μg/ml geneticin (G418, Invitrogen).Table IMetalloid sensitivity of wild type and drug-resistant Leishmania strains transfected with LmAQP1StrainsEC50As(III)Sb(III)μmLtar-neo0.60.2Ltar-AQPneo0.40.1LtarAs50.1-neo80200LtarAs50.1-AQPneo0.50.1LtarSb400.1-neo50>800LtarSb400.1-AQPneo0.50.1Linf-neo25150Linf-AQPneo0.10.06LinfAs200.1-neo1501000LinfAs200.1-AQPneo0.120.4LinfSb4.5-neo400>4000LinfSb4.5-AQPneo0.50.1LV39-neo1.53.0LV39-AQPneo0.10.03LV39Sb600.1-neo40600LV39Sb600.1-AQPneo0.340.1 Open table in a new tab Cloning of Full-length LmAQP1 and LtAQP1—The Leishmania Genome Network gene data base (www.genedb.org/genedb) was inspected for an L. major homologue of human AQP9. Five putative aquaporin homologues were found. The closest homologue to AQP9 (systematic name LmjF31.0020) is 945 bp in length. When the putative reading frame was aligned with human or rat AQP9, there were several possible sites of translational initiation that could add as much as 99 bp to the 5′ end of the gene. To identify the N and C termini of the protein, 5′ and 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was performed. The 3′ end was mapped by the 3′-RACE method using a kit from Ambion. The cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA isolated from L. tarentolae using a primer for the 3′ adapter provided by the manufacturer according to their protocol. The 3′-RACE reaction was performed using Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and a forward gene-specific primer (FO2, 5′-GGACTACTGTTGTTTGTGATTGG-3′) and a reverse 3′-RACE outer primer provided by Ambion. PCR reactions were performed in a Peltier Thermal Cycler (PTC 200) from MJ Research. The 5′ end of LtAQP1 cDNA was determined by the RNA ligase-mediated (RLM) RACE method, using a First Choice™ RLM-RACE kit from Ambion following the manufacturer's protocol. L. tarentolae total RNA was first treated with calf intestinal phosphatase to remove 5′-phosphates from ribosomal RNA, fragmented mRNA, tRNA, and contaminating genomic DNA for 5′-RLM-RACE. The cap structure found on intact 5′ ends of mRNA was not affected by calf intestinal phosphatase. The RNA was then treated with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase to remove the cap structure, leaving a 5′-monophosphate. A 45-bp RNA adapter oligonucleotide was ligated to the RNA population using T4 RNA ligase. The adapter could not ligate to dephosphorylated RNA because these molecules lack the 5′-phosphate necessary for ligation. A random primed reverse transcription was performed using Molony murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase from Ambion followed by nested PCR to amplify the 5′ end of the transcript. The PCR reaction was performed using an antisense gene-specific primer (FO 5′-3, 5′-GTGACAAATCGCGTGCCCCCAACTC-3′). All PCR products were gel-purified, cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega), and sequenced (CEQ 2000 from Beckman Coulter). Full-length (846 bp) LtAQP1 could be generated from overlapping RLM-RACE and 3′-RACE PCR fragments. The reading frame from LtAQP1 was aligned with that of LmjF31.0020 to identify the N and C termini. The DNA sequence from the Leishmania gene data base was used to design forward (5′-TCTAGAATGCATGAGGAAGAGGAGGACC-3′) and reverse (5′-AAGCTTCTAACAGCTGGGCGGAATG-3′) primers (with XbaI at the 5′ and HindIII at the 3′ ends), which were used to clone the 846-bp fragment from total DNA of L. major by PCR. The fragment was cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (LmAQP1/pGEMEasy) and sequenced. Cloning of LmAQP1 in Leishmania Expression Vector pSP72αneoα— pSP72αneoα was created on the backbone of pSP72 (Promega) and pGEM7αneoα vectors. pGEM7αneoα was created as described previously (21Papadopoulou B. Roy G. Ouellette M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3601-3608Google Scholar). In this study, the BamHI-SmaI fragment of pGEM7αneoα was cloned into the same sites of pSP72 to create pSP72αneoα. LmAQP1/pGEMEasy was digested with XbaI and HindIII and cloned into the same sites of pSP72αneoα, giving rise to pSP-AQPneo. Disruption of an LmAQP1 Allele in L. major—An 1830-bp fragment with ∼500-bp upstream and downstream sequences of LmAQP1 was cloned from L. major total DNA by PCR. The fragment was sequenced to confirm the integrity. A 786-bp sequence of LmAQP1 was replaced with a neomycin cassette. The fragment containing the neomycin cassette was linearized and transfected into wild type L. major. Clones resistant to geneticin (G418) were selected. Total DNA was digested with SphI and analyzed by Southern blotting (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), with a DNA probe consisting of the 5′ flanking region of LmAQP1 and a second one specific to the neomycin cassette (see Fig. 6A). Western Blot Analysis—An anti-LmAQP1 rabbit antibody against a peptide corresponding to residues 139–152 of LmAQP1 was synthesized by Covance Corp. (Denver, PA). Plasma membranes were prepared from Leishmania infantum and L. tarentolae transfected with vector alone or LmAQP1 as described previously (23Dey S. Ouellette M. Lightbody J. Papadopoulou B. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2192-2197Google Scholar). Total membrane protein was estimated using Amido Black (24Newman M.J. Foster D.L. Wilson T.H. Kaback H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11804-11808Google Scholar). Membranes (350 μg) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 10% acrylamide gels (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with the anti-peptide antibody at 1:4000 dilution, performed as described previously (9Mukhopadhyay R. Shi J. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21149-21157Google Scholar). Transfection of LmAQP1 in Leishmania—Transfection of pSP-AQPneo into the Leishmania promastigotes was accomplished as described previously (26Ouellette M. Fase-Fowler F. Borst P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1027-1033Google Scholar). Selections were performed with 120 μg/ml geneticin (G418) from Invitrogen. Metalloid Sensitivity Assays—Metalloid sensitivity of the promastigote transfectants and the single LmAQP1 knock-out strain was determined as described previously (27Haimeur A. Ouellette M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 1689-1694Google Scholar). Log phase promastigote cultures were diluted to 106 cells/ml in Semi-defined medium 79 containing various concentrations of As(III) in the form of sodium arsenite or Sb(III) in the form of potassium antimonyl tartrate. Growth was monitored from the absorbance at 600 nm after 5 days. EC50 was calculated from the slope of the linear regression of absorbance versus metalloid concentration. Each assay was performed three times. Error bars were calculated from the mean ± S.E. Metalloid sensitivity of amastigotes inside macrophages was achieved by co-transfecting a field-resistant L. donovani strain, isolated from a patient from Bihar who did not respond to pentavalent antimony chemotherapy, with LmAQP1 and firefly luciferase gene as described previously (28Roy G. Dumas C. Sereno D. Wu Y. Singh A.K. Tremblay M.J. Ouellette M. Olivier M. Papadopoulou B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 110: 195-206Google Scholar). THP-1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium until the cells were confluent followed by treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate was washed with prewarmed medium and then infected with luciferase expressing stationary-phase promastigotes overexpressing AQP1 or vector alone, at a parasite to macrophage ratio of 10:1. After incubation at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 2 h, non-internalized parasites were washed away, and infected macrophages were treated with different concentrations of Pentostam. Macrophages were lysed and 20 μl of the lysate were mixed with luciferase assay buffer and transferred to a luminometer plate, and luciferase activity was measured in a microtiter plate luminometer. Values are expressed as relative light units. EC50 was determined by plotting the percentage of relative light units as a function of drug concentration. Error bars were calculated from the mean ± S.E. Uptake Assays—Log phase Leishmania promastigotes were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, (Invitrogen) and suspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mm glucose at a density of 5 × 107 cells/ml. Promastigotes were then incubated with 100 μm As(III) or Sb(III) for 10 min at 27 °C. An 0.5-ml portion was washed twice with the same volume of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 1 min at room temperature, dried, digested with 0.05 ml of 70% nitric acid for 2 h at 70 °C, diluted to 5 ml with high pressure liquid chromatography water, and then analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (Elan 9000, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described previously (29Brochu C. Wang J. Roy G. Messier N. Wang X.Y. Saravia N.G. Ouellette M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2003; 47: 3073-3079Google Scholar). Each transport experiment was repeated three times with duplicate samples. Error bars were calculated from the mean ± S.E. Identification and Cloning of LmAQP1—The Leishmania Genome Network gene data base contains five L. major sequences for aquaporin homologues. Four of the sequences are more similar to aquaporin water channels than to aquaglyceroporins. Only the fifth (systematic name LmjF31.0020), located in chromosome 31, has significant sequence similarity to aquaglyceroporins. This 314-residue protein sequence from L. major, which we designated LmAQP1, has a potential 33-residue (MNSPTTMPLQCHDAETQLYVDKESPEGLPIGNQ) N-terminal extension when aligned with human or rat AQP9. To identify the likely N and C termini of the L. major and the L. tarentolae homologue, 5′-RLM-RACE and 3′-RACE PCR were performed with total RNA isolated from L. tarentolae. Clear bands were observed from 5′-RLM-RACE and 3′-RACE PCR, respectively, using overlapping primers. These fragments were cloned and sequenced, giving rise to an 846-bp gene that we designated LtAQP1. Alignment of LtAQP1 with LmAQP1 suggested that the N terminus of the latter starts from the third methionine. LmAQP1 was subsequently cloned by PCR from L. major total DNA as a complete 846-bp gene, which was then sequenced and found to conform to the data base sequence. Alignment of LtAQP1 and LmAQP1 with rat and human AQP9 protein sequences showed 40% overall sequence similarity with the mammalian homologues and 77% overall sequence similarity among themselves (Fig. 1). Both sequences have six transmembrane segments and the four signature motifs (P1–P4) of known aquaglyceroporins. LmAQP1 was chosen for further analysis. Expression of LmAQP1 Confers Metalloid Sensitivity in Leishmania—LmAQP1 was cloned in the Leishmania expression vector pSP72αneoα, and the resulting plasmid pSP-AQPneo was transfected into three parental strains of L. tarentolae, L. infantum, and L. major. Each strain became hypersensitive to Sb(III) and also to As(III) when transfected with LmAQP1 compared with transfection with vector alone (Table I). Sensitization was greater in pathogenic strains L. infantum and L. major compared with the non-pathogenic strain L. tarentolae. The L. tarentolae AQPneo strain exhibited a 1.5-fold increase in sensitivity to As(III) and a 2.0-fold increase in sensitivity to Sb(III). On the other hand, the L. infantum AQPneo strain became 250- and 2500-fold more sensitive to As(III) and Sb(III), respectively. The EC50 of the L. major AQPneo strain was 15-fold lower for As(III) and 100-fold lower for Sb(III). Production of LmAQP1 in transfected L. tarentolae and L. infantum was detected by immunoblotting with antiserum raised against a peptide corresponding to residues 139–152 of LmAQP1 (Fig. 2, B and C, insets). Because expression of LmAQP1 increases transport across the plasma membrane, it is reasonable to assume that this protein is localized predominantly in that membrane. By stepwise selection in vitro, we have isolated promastigotes of several strains that are resistant to Sb(III) and As(III) (29Brochu C. Wang J. Roy G. Messier N. Wang X.Y. Saravia N.G. Ouellette M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2003; 47: 3073-3079Google Scholar, 30Dey S. Papadopoulou B. Haimeur A. Roy G. Grondin K. Dou D. Rosen B.P. Ouellette M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 67: 49-57Google Scholar). Promastigotes selected against one metalloid were cross-resistant to the other (Table I). Strikingly, when transfected with pSP-AQPneo, each resistant mutant became resensitized to both metalloids. The EC50 of each transfected resistant mutant was even lower than its respective wild type levels (Table I) and was closer to values found in wild type cells transfected with LmAQP1. LmAQP1 Facilitates Uptake of Sb(III) and As(III) in Leishmania Promastigotes—The ability of Leishmania AQP1 to transport Sb(III) and As(III) was investigated. LmAQP1 transfected strains L. tarentolae AQPneo, L. infantum AQPneo, and L. major AQPneo showed rapid uptake of Sb(III) (Fig. 2) and As(III) (Fig. 3) compared with transfectants with vector alone. Even though these channels do not catalyze net accumulation, binding to intracellular sites, metabolic alteration, or sequestration in organelles will result in an apparent accumulation of the metalloids; so, for all practical purposes, the assay measures accumulation. Each Leishmania species expressing LmAQP1 had much higher rates of uptake and exhibited an apparent steady state level of As(III) and Sb(III) that was 20–50-fold more than the untransfected control. Although the L. tarentolae (wild type) strain also accumulated higher amounts of As(III) or Sb(III), it was less sensitive to the metalloids than other species. This could be because of an ability to sequester the metals more efficiently than others. As described previously, most Leishmania species selected for resistance to As(III) or Sb(III) in vitro showed a reduced accumulation of the metalloids compared with the parental strains (29Brochu C. Wang J. Roy G. Messier N. Wang X.Y. Saravia N.G. Ouellette M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2003; 47: 3073-3079Google Scholar, 30Dey S. Papadopoulou B. Haimeur A. Roy G. Grondin K. Dou D. Rosen B.P. Ouellette M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 67: 49-57Google Scholar). When resistant mutants were transfected with pSP-AQPneo, they exhibited substantially higher rates of uptake and 50–100-fold higher levels of intracellular Sb(III) (Fig. 4A) or As(III) (Fig. 4B). We propose that the increase in the rate of uptake is responsible for resensitization of the resistant mutants to metalloids. This indicates that the uptake of Sb(III) may have become rate-limiting for drug action in these mutants. LmAQP1 Sensitizes Antimony-resistant Field Isolates of L. donovani—A field isolate of L. donovani (FDA9518) from a patient who failed to respond to pentavalent antimonials therapy in India (31Lira R. Sundar S. Makharia A. Kenney R. Gam A. Saraiva E. Sacks D. J. Infect. Dis. 1999; 180: 564-567Google Scholar) and the corresponding sensitive strain (FDA9551) with similar karyotypes, as determined by pulse field gel electrophoresis, were transfected with LmAQP1. Both strains were 3-fold more sensitive to Pentostam (Fig. 5 and Table II) as amastigotes inside macrophages, compared with the strains transfected with vector alone. The resistant strain transfected with LmAQP1 was also much more sensitive to As(III) (40-fold) or Sb(III) (200-fold) (Table II) in vitro as promastigotes. These results suggest that uptake may be rate-limiting for Pentostam action in clinical isolates as well as resistant laboratory strains.Table IIMetalloid sensitivity of field isolates overexpressing LmAQP1StrainsEC50As(III)Sb(III)Sb(V)μmFDA9518-hygro80400>200FDA9518-AQPhygro2275FDA9551-hygro3516050FDA9551-AQPhygro3315 Open table in a new tab Disruption of an LmAQP1 Allele Confers Resistance—Because Leishmania is a diploid organism, it is necessary to disrupt the gene on both chromosomes to construct a homozygous knock-out organism. Presently we have constructed a heterozygous knock-out of L. major by disruption of one of the two alleles (Fig. 6A). This single knock-out is 10-fold more resistant to Sb(III) than the homozygous wild type parent (Fig. 6B). This supports our hypothesis that the amount of AQP1 in the plasma membrane is the rate-limiting step in uptake of the activated form of the antimonial drugs. It also strengthens the argument that point mutations in the AQP1 gene could give rise to clinical resistance. This is an important observation because it was not clear whether a single mutation would result in a sufficient reduction in uptake to produce resistance. Future studies will focus on the appearance of mutations in the AQP1 gene and the levels of AQP1 in the plasma membrane of field isolates of drug-resistant parasites. We have identified a homologue of mammalian aquaglyceroporin, AQP9, in two strains of Leishmania. Leishmania AQP1 is clearly responsible for As(III) and Sb(III) uptake in Leishmania promastigotes and is likely the major route of uptake of trivalent metalloids. As such, AQP1 modulates drug sensitivity when expressed at increased levels in both promastigotes (Table I) and amastigotes (Fig. 5). It increases the rate of uptake to such an extent that it can overcome any mechanism of resistance by flooding the cytosol with metalloid. The active component of Pentostam and Glucantime, the first line choices of drug treatment against all forms of leishmaniasis, is inorganic Sb(V). These drugs are formulations in which chelation of the Sb(V) with either gluconate (Pentostam) or the sorbitol derivative 1-deoxy-1-(methylamino)-d-glucitol (Glucantime) increase solubility. Sb(V) is taken up by both promastigotes and amastigotes (29Brochu C. Wang J. Roy G. Messier N. Wang X.Y. Saravia N.G. Ouellette M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2003; 47: 3073-3079Google Scholar), although transporters for pentavalent antimony have not been identified. Axenic amastigotes of L. infantum, L. panamensis (29Brochu C. Wang J. Roy G. Messier N. Wang X.Y. Saravia N.G. Ouellette M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2003; 47: 3073-3079Google Scholar), L. amazonensis (32Croft S.L. Neame K.D. Homewood C.A. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. C. 1981; 68: 95-98Google Scholar), and L. donovani (7Shaked-Mishan P. Ulrich N. Ephros M. Zilberstein D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3971-3976Google Scholar) accumulate more Sb(V) than Sb(III). Despite this fact, an m-chlorocresol-free Sb(V) formulation has no leishmanicidal activity against either promastigotes or axenic amastigotes at pharmacological concentrations (6Sereno D. Cavaleyra M. Zemzoumi K. Maquaire S. Ouaissi A. Lemesre J.L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 3097-3102Google Scholar, 33Mottram J.C. Coombs G.H. Exp.

Additive-free Pentostam preparations, however, were as effective as the crude preparation against amastigotes grown inside of macrophages (6Sereno D. Cavaleyra M. Zemzoumi K. Maquaire S. Ouaissi A. Lemesre J.L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 3097-3102Google Scholar, 35Sereno D. Roy G. Lemesre J.L. Papadopoulou B. Ouellette M. Antimicrob. Agents. Chemother. 2001; 45: 1168-1173Google Scholar, 36Roberts W.L. Rainey P.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1993; 37: 1842-1846Google Scholar), suggesting that macrophages are involved in Pentostam activity. We have recently observed that Sb(III)-resistant amastigotes of L. panamensis and L. infantum are cross-resistant to Sb(V) when grown inside of macrophages, whereas Sb(III) is highly leishmanicidal against both forms of the parasite. 2M. Ouellette, unpublished data. Previous studies found no correlation between clinical response and in vitro resistance to Sb(V) with the promastigote stage of the parasite (31Lira R. Sundar S. Makharia A. Kenney R. Gam A. Saraiva E. Sacks D. J. Infect. Dis. 1999; 180: 564-567Google Scholar); however, a correlation was observed with intracellular parasites (31Lira R. Sundar S. Makharia A. Kenney R. Gam A. Saraiva E. Sacks D. J. Infect. Dis. 1999; 180: 564-567Google Scholar). Interestingly, we also observed a correlation between resistance to Sb(III) and to As(III) in both promastigotes and intracellular amastigotes (Table II). Thus, it is reasonable to predict that a reduction of Sb(V) to Sb(III) is necessary for drug activation and that much of the reduction occurs in host macrophages. If so, then expression of amastigote AQP1 may be an important determinant in drug sensitivity. In addition, amastigotes generally are more sensitive to Sb(III) than promastigotes (29Brochu C. Wang J. Roy G. Messier N. Wang X.Y. Saravia N.G. Ouellette M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2003; 47: 3073-3079Google Scholar), suggesting that AQP1 could be differentially regulated in the two developmental stages of the parasite. We have observed that the amastigotes expressing LmAQP1 inside of macrophages are less sensitive to Sb(V) than the promastigotes to Sb(III) (Table II). One possibility is that the effective concentration of Sb(III) is low inside macrophages. This could also suggest that the rate of reduction is limiting in the macrophage or that some Sb(V) is directly transported into amastigotes before reduction by macrophages and thereby reduces the available concentration of Sb(III) in the macrophages. It is important, however, to note that LmAQP1 rendered the resistant strain as sensitive as the wild type. The magnitude of this effect is more than sufficient to reverse the drug resistance in the field. Drug resistance is a major impediment to successful treatment of leishmaniasis (3Guerin P.J.

Makharia A. Kumar P.C. Murray H.W. Clin. Infect. Dis. 2000; 31: 1104-1107Google Scholar). Down-regulation or loss of uptake systems has been shown to lead to drug resistance (11Sanders O.I. Rensing C. Kuroda M. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3365-3367Google Scholar, 12Wysocki R. Chery C.C. Wawrzycka D. Van Hulle M. Cornelis R. Thevelein J.M. Tamas M.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1391-1401Google Scholar). Our results show that the loss of one AQP1 allele results in a 10-fold increase in drug resistance. It will be important to determine whether clinical drug resistance correlates with loss of AQP1 activity. Notably, the expression of AQP1 reverses metalloid resistance in several Leishmania strains selected for resistance in vitro or in field isolates. The mechanisms of resistance in some of these strains have been determined, and there is considerable diversity in the causes of resistance (37Guimond C. Trudel N. Brochu C. Marquis N. El Fadili A. Peytavi R. Briand G. Richard D. Messier N. Papadopoulou B. Corbeil J. Bergeron M.G. Legare D. Ouellette M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5886-5896Google Scholar).2 This suggests that increasing expression of AQP1 can reverse resistance in diverse backgrounds of resistance.

However, the exact mechanism by which tBID and BIMEL aid BAX and its close homologues in this mitochondrial protein release remains enigmatic. Here, using pure lipid vesicles, we provide evidence that tBID acts in concert with BAX to 1) form large membrane openings through both BH3-dependent and BH3-independent mechanisms, 2) cause lipid transbilayer movement concomitant with membrane permeabilization, and 3) disrupt the lipid bilayer structure of the membrane by promoting positive monolayer curvature stress. None of these effects were observed with BAX when BIMEL was substituted for tBID. Based on these data, we propose a novel model in which tBID assists BAX not only via protein-protein but also via protein-lipid interactions to form lipidic pore-type non-bilayer structures in the outer mitochondrial membrane through which intermembrane prodeath molecules exit mitochondria during apoptosis.

Members of the BCL-2 family possess up to four conserved regions called BCL-2 homology (BH) domains and can be either proapoptotic or antiapoptotic. Based on these criteria, BCL-2 family members can be divided into three subgroups. Members of the first subgroup, exemplified by BCL-2, contain four BH domains and act predominantly as death inhibitors. Members of the second subgroup, exemplified by BAX, contain BH1–BH3 domains and promote apoptosis in most cellular contexts. Finally members of the third subgroup share only the BH3 domain (BH3-only proteins) and appear to function invariably as death agonists. Two of the most highly studied and important BH3-only proteins are BID and BIM. BID and BIM must cooperate with multidomain proapoptotic members to kill cells (5Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H.

Cell. 2001; 8: 705-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear exactly how BID and BIM function in concert with BAX-type proteins to induce the release of mitochondrial intermembrane apoptogenic factors. One popular model holds that BID and BIM share a common mode of action via BH3-mediated binding to BAX-type proteins at the OMM (8Letai A. Bassik M.C. Walensky L.D. Sorcinelli M.D. Weiler S. Korsmeyer S.J. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar). This physical interaction is believed to trigger a conformational change of multidomain proapoptotic members, resulting in their intramembraneous oligomerization and OMM permeabilization. Other not necessarily mutually exclusive mechanisms of action proposed for BID and BIM include (i) binding to and neutralization or reversal of prosurvival BCL-2-type family member function (6Zong W.X.

Accumulating evidence indicates that lipids can play important roles at different stages of the molecular pathway driven by proapoptotic BCL-2 family members culminating with OMM permeabilization and release of intermembrane apoptogenic factors. First, an early, reversible conformational change of BAX associated with apoptosis induction that occurs prior to BAX oligomerization can be reproduced in vitro upon interaction of monomeric BAX with purely lipidic vesicles (21Yethon J.A. Epand R.F. Leber B. Epand R.M. Andrews D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48935-48941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Second, specific lipids have been shown to favor membrane association of activated forms of BAX and BID. For example, apoptogenic fatty acids augment binding to liposomes of an oligomeric form of BAX capable of inducing mitochondrial cytochrome c release (22Epand R.F. Martinou J.-C. Montessuit S. Epand R.M. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 509-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon engagement of cell surface death receptors, BID is proteolytically cleaved by activated caspase-8, generating caspase-8-cleaved BID (cBID), which subsequently dissociates into a truncated carboxyl-terminal fragment (tBID) harboring the full apoptogenicity of the molecule and an amino-terminal inert fragment (23Luo X. Budlhardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3085) Google Scholar, 24Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.-J. Yuan J.

Cardiolipin (CL) increases binding of both cBID and tBID to pure lipid vesicles as well as to the OMM (26Lutter M. Fang M. Luo X. Nishijima M. Xie X. Wang X. Nat.

Science. 2000; 290: 1761-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Third, BID and cBID possess lipid transfer activity, raising the possibility that BID/cBID may transport specific lipids into or out of the OMM during apoptosis to facilitate breaching of this permeability barrier (17Esposti M.D. Erler J.T. Hickman J.A. Dive C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7268-7276Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 29Esposti M.D. Cristea I.M. Gaskell S.J. Nakao Y. Dive C.

Finally lipids have been implicated in creating a permeability pathway at the OMM through which intermembrane apoptogenic factors are released into the cytosol. BAX-type proteins destabilize planar lipid bilayers through reduction of membrane line tension and permeabilize large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) to cytochrome c through a mechanism sensitive to changes in membrane monolayer curvature (32Basañez G.

Based on these findings, we proposed that BAX-type proteins increase OMM monolayer curvature stress, promoting the formation of a large pore with its surface covered, at least partially, by polar head groups of bent mitochondrial lipids (lipidic pore model) (32Basañez G.

Cell. 2002; 111: 331-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar) showed that activated BAX forms very large pores in a CL-dependent manner and hypothesized that CL cooperates with BAX to form highly curved non-bilayer lipid structures, such as lipidic pores or inverted micelles at the OMM. Interestingly, in the course of apoptosis, BAX-type proteins co-localize with components of the mitochondrial fusion and fission machineries at sites of OMM scission in which lipids are likely to adopt non-bilayer dispositions (36Karbowski M. Lee Y.-J. Gaume B. Jeong S.-Y. Frank S. Nechushtan A. Santel A. Fuller M. Smith C.L. Youle R.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 931-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). In the present study, we used LUVs to investigate the mechanism(s) through which biologically active forms of BID and BIM assist BAX to create a membrane passageway large enough to permit transit of mitochondrial intermembrane prodeath proteins. Our results support the notion that tBID acts in concert with BAX to form lipidic pores in the membrane of LUVs allowing for the release of macromolecules of the size of cytochrome c and other larger mitochondrial apoptogenic factors. tBID appears to act not only by triggering BAX intramembranous oligomerization via its BH3 domain but also by directly assisting BAX to form these large lipidic pores, utilizing a non-BH3 portion of the molecule. None of these effects were observed with BIMEL, but BIMEL reversed the inhibitory effect of BCL-2 on LUV permeabilization.

Eskes R. Martinou J.-C. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar) were obtained as described previously. All proteins were >90% pure electrophoretically. Octylglucoside (OG)-activated BAX (OG-BAX) was obtained by incubating BAX in 100 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0 buffer (KHE buffer) containing OG (2%, w/v) for 1 h at 4 °C. Dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC), dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE), dioleoylglycerol (DOG), oleoylphosphatidylcholine (O-LPC), oleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (O-LPE), tetraoleoylphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin) (TOPG), heart CL, egg phosphatidylcholine (PC), egg phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), egg phosphatidylglycerol (PG), brain phosphatidylserine (PS), and liver phosphatidylinositol (PI) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). KCl, HEPES, EDTA, dodecyl octaethylene glycol mono ether (C12E8), D2O, melittin, Staphylococcus aureus α-toxin, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled dextrans (FDs) of 10 kDa (FD-10) and 70 kDa (FD-70) were obtained from Sigma. 8-Aminonaphtalene-1,3,6-trisulfonate (ANTS) and p-xylene-bispyridinium bromide (DPX) were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Release of Cytochrome c from Isolated Mitochondria—Mitochondria were isolated from livers of male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats as described in Basañez et al. (33Basañez G. Zhang J. Chau B.N. Maksaev G.I. Frolov V.A. Brandt T.A. Burch J. Hardwick J.M. Zimmerberg J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31083-31091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Isolated mitochondria (200 μg of protein/ml) were incubated for 20 min with recombinant proteins in 50 μlof125 mm KCl, 5 mm KH2PO4, 25 μm EGTA, 5 mm succinate, 5 μm rotenone, and 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2. Reaction mixtures were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Supernatant fractions (20 μl) were subjected to 4–20% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using anti-cytochrome c 7H8.2C-12 antibody (Pharmingen) and visualization by the ECL method (Amersham Biosciences). Mitochondria were kept on ice and used within 3 h of preparation. Preparation of LUVs—Lipid mixtures at the indicated ratios were co-dissolved in chloroform/methanol (2:1). Organic solvents were removed by evaporation under an argon stream followed by incubation under vacuum for 2 h. Dry lipid films were resuspended in the following buffers: for assays of release of vesicular contents, KHE buffer supplemented with either 100 mg/ml FDs or 12.5 mm ANTS, 45 mm DPX, 20 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0; for assays of vesicular size, BAX oligomerization, and transbilayer lipid redistribution, KHE buffer; for assays of membrane binding and integral membrane insertion of BAX, KHE buffer using D2O instead of H2O. LUVs were formed by the method of Mayer et al. (39Mayer L.D. Hope M.J. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 858: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar) using 20 freeze/thaw cycles and two polycarbonate membranes of 0.2-μm pore size for extrusion (Nucleopore, San Diego, CA). Untrapped ANTS/DPX and FDs were removed by gel filtration in Sephadex G-25 and Sephacryl S-500 HR columns, respectively, with KHE running as elution buffer. Lipid concentration was determined by the method of Bartlett et al. (40Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, liposome composition was DOPC/TOPG (cardiolipin) (80:20, mol/mol). Release of LUV-entrapped Markers—Release of LUV-encapsulated fluorescent markers was monitored in an SLM-2 Aminco-Bowman luminescence spectrometer (Spectronic Instruments, Rochester, NY) in a thermostatted 1-cm path length cuvette with constant stirring at 37 °C. For FDs, λex was 490, and λem was 520 nm (slits, 4 nm); for ANTS/DPX, λex was 350 nm, and λem was 520 nm (slits, 8 nm). A 515 nm cut-off filter was placed between the sample and the emission monochromator to avoid scattering interferences. The extent of marker release was quantified on a percentage basis according to the equation: (Ft – F0/F100 – F0) × 100 where Ft is the measured fluorescence of protein-treated LUVs at time t, F0 is the initial fluorescence of the LUV suspension before protein addition, and F100 is the fluorescence value after complete disruption of LUVs by addition of C12E8 (final concentration, 0.5 mm). Unless otherwise stated, lipid concentration was 20 μm. Assays of BAX Binding to and Insertion into the LUV Membrane—To measure the amount of BAX bound to LUVs, a method was used based on the fact that lipid-associated protein, but not free protein, floats in D2O-based KHE buffer. Briefly proteins and LUVs were incubated together at 37 °C in D2O-based KHE buffer (final volume of reaction mixture, 100 μl) followed by centrifugation of the mixture for 1 h at 100,000 × g at room temperature. Under these conditions, LUVs remained in the upper fraction of the buffer, whereas free BAX protein sedimented. The top 20-μl fraction of the gradient, corresponding to the lipid-associated fraction, was subjected to SDS-PAGE in 15% Tris-glycine gels followed by BAX visualization by Western blotting using N20 anti-BAX polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). To discriminate between protein inserted into and only peripherally adsorbed to the membrane surface, the same protocol as above was followed except that a second incubation was performed for 30 min at pH 11.5 with the alkaline pH being maintained during sample centrifugation. Upon alkaline pH incubation, the fraction of protein integrated into the membrane hydrophobic matrix remains associated to LUVs, whereas the fraction of protein only peripherally associated with the membrane is detached from vesicles. Size Exclusion Chromatography Analysis of BAX Oligomerization in LUVs—Experiments were performed in a Superdex-200 (15 × 45 cm) column equilibrated with 100 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 0.2 mm EDTA (pH 7.0) with or without 2% (w/v) CHAPS (J. T. Baker Inc.) at a 1 ml/min flow rate. The column was calibrated using protein gel filtration standards (Bio-Rad). Samples of 300 μl were loaded onto the column followed by collection of 2-ml elution fractions. Aliquots of individual fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE in 15% Tris-glycine gels followed by visualization of BAX using N20 anti-BAX antibody. Measurements of LUV Size by Quasielastic Light Scattering—Vesicle size was determined by quasielastic light scattering at a fixed angle of 90° and room temperature using a Malvern Zetasizer 4 instrument (Malvern, UK). A 64-channel correlator was used capable of estimating particle sizes in the range from 5 to 5000 nm. Data were analyzed by the cumulant method using Malvern application software. The hydrodynamic radius of the particle was obtained from the first cumulant, whereas the polydispersity of the sample was obtained from the second cumulant. Assays of Lipid Transbilayer Movement in LUVs—Assays of lipid transbilayer motion were done using 1-lauroyl-2-(1′-pyrenebutyroyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (pyPC) as described before (41Muller P. Schiller S. Wieprecht T. Dathe M. Herrmann A. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2000; 106: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 42Basañez G. Shinnar A.E. Zimmerberg J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Briefly pyPC dissolved in an ethanolic solution was added externally to the liposome suspension at a final concentration of 5 mol % (pyPC/total lipid), leading to its incorporation only in the external monolayer of the membrane. When pyPC translocates from the external membrane monolayer to the internal membrane monolayer the probe is diluted, leading to a decrease in the ratio of fluorescence intensities of pyPC excimers to pyPC monomers (IE/IM). The degree of pyPC transbilayer redistribution (q) was estimated from measured IE/IM ratios using a calibration curve obtained with LUVs containing different molar amounts of pyPC as described before (41Muller P. Schiller S. Wieprecht T. Dathe M. Herrmann A. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2000; 106: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Fluorescence was monitored in an SLM-2 Aminco-Bowman luminescence spectrometer (Spectronic Instruments) in a thermostatted 1-cm path length cuvette with constant stirring at 37 °C. λex was set at 345 nm, λemM was set at 395 nm, and λemE was set at 465. Unless otherwise stated, lipid concentration was 20 μm. tBID, but Not BIMEL, Works in Conjunction with BAX to Form Large Membrane Openings in LUVs—To elucidate the mechanism(s) by which BID and BIM assist BAX in the release of mitochondrial intermembrane apoptogenic factors, we first used an in vitro reconstitution system consisting of mitochondria (which contain minimal amounts of BAX and BAK) freshly isolated from rat liver (43Polster B.M. Kinnally K.W. Fiskum G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37887-37894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and various combinations of recombinant purified proapoptotic proteins. We used physiologically relevant concentrations of full-length monomeric BAX (44Polster B.M. Basañez G. Young M. Suzuki M. Fiskum G. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2735-2743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) together with increasing concentrations of tBID or a form of BIM previously shown to induce BAX-dependent mitochondrial cytochrome c release in cultured cells (BIMEL) (20Yamaguchi H. Wang H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41604-41612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Soluble fractions were separated from mitochondria by centrifugation and assayed for the presence of freed cytochrome c by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 1A, the combination of BAX with either tBID or BIMEL led to release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, whereas none of these proteins alone released substantial cytochrome c under the conditions tested (Fig. 1A, and data not shown). However, tBID released mitochondrial cytochrome in the presence of BAX with ∼5-fold higher potency compared with BIMEL (Fig. 1A). Next we wished to test whether, in the absence of additional proteins, tBID and/or BIMEL can assist BAX to release macromolecules of the size of cytochrome c (∼12 kDa) as well as other larger prodeath proteins released from mitochondria during apoptosis, i.e. Smac/DIABLO (∼23 kDa), endonuclease G (∼30 kDa), Omi/HtrA2 (∼37 kDa), and apoptosis-inducing factor (∼57 kDa) (4Festjens N. van Gurp M. van Loo G. Saelens X. Vandenabeele P. Acta Haematol. (Basel). 2004; 111: 7-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To this aim, we used LUVs loaded with self-quenching concentrations of FD-70. Release of LUV-entrapped FD-70 was monitored as an increase in the fluorescence signal due to marker dilution in the external medium. None of the proapoptotic proteins alone caused significant FD-70 release from LUVs (data not shown). However, when LUVs were treated with a BAX + tBID mixture efficient efflux of vesicular FD-70 ensued (Fig. 1B). Kuwana et al. (35Kuwana T. Mackey M.R. Perkins G. Ellisman M.H. Latterich M. Schneiter R. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Cell. 2002; 111: 331-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar) have shown previously that the combination of BAX and cBID can elicit the release of 2000-kDa dextrans from pure lipid vesicles. We found that the combination of BAX and tBID is more potent in the release of vesicular FD-70 than the BAX + cBID combination (Fig. 1B). This finding is consistent with evidence showing that BID possesses an autoinhibitory amino-terminal domain that remains attached to the apoptogenic carboxyl-terminal part of the molecule after caspase-8 cleavage (15Kudla G. Montessuit S. Eskes R. Berrier C. Martinou J.C. Ghazi A. Antonsson B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22713-22718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In sharp contrast to the situation found with tBID/cBID, addition of BIMEL together with BAX resulted in virtually no vesicular FD-70 release even at concentrations of BIMEL 10-fold higher than those used in the tBID/cBID assays (Fig. 1B). Antiapoptotic proteins such as BCL-2 antagonize the release of mitochondrial prodeath factors during apoptosis (1Newmeyer D.D. Ferguson-Miller S.

Here we report that RUNX3 is a target of the acetyltransferase activity of p300. The p300-dependent acetylation of three lysine residues protects RUNX3 from ubiquitin ligase Smurf-mediated degradation. The extent of the acetylation is up-regulated by the transforming growth factor-β signaling pathway and down-regulated by histone deacetylase activities. Our findings demonstrate that the level of RUNX3 protein is controlled by the competitive acetylation and deacetylation of the three lysine residues, revealing a new mechanism for the posttranslational regulation of RUNX3 expression.

The RUNX family of transcriptional regulators plays pivotal roles in various developmental differentiation processes ranging from sex determination, eye development, hematopoiesis, and segmentation in Drosophila to hematopoiesis, bone development, and neurogenesis in mammals. An important feature of these proteins is the Runt domain, a conserved 128-amino acid region that is necessary for binding specific DNA sequences (1Bae S.C. Ito Y. Histol.

Acetylation mediated by the transcriptional coactivator p300 is known to stimulate transcription either by modifying histones in chromatin to produce a transcriptionally active conformation or by directly targeting transcriptional activators such as p53, GATA-1, and E2F (19Brooks C.L. Gu W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 20Gu W. Roeder R.G.

It has been reported that p300 interacts with RUNX1 and stimulates RUNX1-dependent transcription (22Kitabayashi I. Yokoyama A. Shimizu K. Ohki M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2994-3004Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). In contrast, histone deacetylase-6 (HDAC-6) interacts with RUNX2 and represses RUNX2-dependent transcription (23Westendorf J.J. Zaidi S.K. Cascino J.E. Kahler R. van Wijnen A.J. Lian J.B. Yoshida M. Stein G.S. Li X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7982-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Despite these various observations, the underlying molecular mechanisms that are involved in the regulation of RUNX3 activity are poorly understood. Here we report that p300 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity can acetylate lysine residues in RUNX3. The TGF-β superfamily signaling pathway enhances the level of acetylation and the stability of RUNX3. Because the same RUNX3 lysine residues can be targeted by ubiquitin ligase Smurfs, TGF-β appears to suppress RUNX3 ubiquitination and degradation through competitive acetylation. HDACs deacetylate RUNX3 and allow the protein to be degraded through the ubiquitin-mediated pathway. Our results demonstrate previously unidentified links among p300, HDACs, and Smurf in controlling RUNX3 stabilization and degradation. Cell Culture—All tissue culture media and antibiotics were from Invitrogen. 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics and antimycotics at 37 °C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Plasmids and Antibodies—Myc-, HA-, and green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged RUNX1, RUNX2, RUNX3 full-length and deletion mutants were constructed in a CMV promoter-derived mammalian expression vector (pCS4–3Myc, -3HA, -GFP). Mutations affecting the RUNX3 acetylation site were introduced by PCR, and mutant cDNAs were cloned into the pCS4–3Myc and -3HA vectors. Human p300 fragments were generated by PCR and cloned into the pCS4–3FLAG vector. The expression plasmids for the Myc-HDAC series, HA-CBFβ, and HA-Smad3 were created by cloning into pCS4–3MYC or pCS4–3HA. The plasmid pGL3–12-RXE-luc was constructed by inserting 12 tandem repeats of the RUNX-binding site (AACCACA) into the multicloning site of pGL3-luciferase (Promega). The HA-p300 expression vectors were kind gifts from M. Ewen (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School). The FLAG-Smurf1 and -Smurf2 expression vectors were generously provided by K. Miyazono (University of Tokyo). In this study, antibodies against acetyl-lysine (Cell Signaling Technology), p300 (RW128; Upstate Biotech), Myc (9E10; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), HA (12CA5; Roche Applied Science), and FLAG (M2; Sigma) were used. DNA Transfections and Reporter Assay—Transient transfections were performed using the calcium phosphate method. For luciferase assays, 293 cells were plated into 24-well plates 1 day before transfection. At 36 h posttransfection, the cell lysates were analyzed for luciferase activity with the luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega). The pCMV β-galactosidase plasmid was included as an internal control for transfection efficiency. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Analysis—After transfection, 293 cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% Na deoxycholate, 10% glycerol, 25 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 250 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) and cleared by centrifugation. The resulting supernatants were immunoprecipitated with appropriate antibodies plus protein A- or protein G-Sepharose beads, followed by incubation at 4 °C. The beads were washed extensively, and the bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were incubated with appropriate antibodies, washed, and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies. After washing, the blots were developed with Western blotting chemiluminescence luminol reagent (Amersham Biosciences). For trichostatin A (TSA) (Sigma) treatment, 293 cells were cultured in fresh medium for 1 day after transfection and then treated with the indicated concentrations of TSA for 16 h. Immunofluorescence Studies—Cells grown on 22-mm coverslips (Fisher) were transfected as indicated, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, and then blocked with 10% fetal bovine serum, phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Triton X-100 for 45 min. To detect Myc-HDAC5, cells were stained with 1:200-diluted 9E10, an anti-Myc monoclonal antibody. Cells were incubated with primary antibody for 1 h, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated for 1 h with Rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody. To visualize the nucleus, cells were counterstained with 1 μg/ml 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Sigma). After mounting, cells were analyzed with a laser-scanning confocal microscope (Leica) or Nikon TE-2000 fluorescence microscope. Determination of Protein Half-life—For half-life experiments, 293 cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of RUNX3 by the calcium phosphate method. 36 h after transfection, cells were incubated with 40 μg/ml cycloheximide for the indicated times, and equal amounts of lysate in micrograms were subjected to immunoblot analysis. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—The electrophoretic mobility shift assay procedure and nucleotide sequences of the TGF-β-responsive element and competitors (M1 and M2) were previously described (18Lee K.S. Kim H.J. Li Q.L. Chi X.Z. Ueta C. Komori T. Wozney J.M. Kim E.G. Choi J.Y. Ryoo H.M. Bae S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8783-8792Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). Semi-quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR—Reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed for 27 cycles that showed exponential increase of reaction products. Endogenous RUNX3 mRNA was amplified by primer EnA (5′-ATGCGTATTCCCGTA GACCCA-3′) and primer EnB (5′-CAGCTTCTGCCGGTGCCGTCT-3′). Cytomegalovirus promoter-driven RUNX3 mRNA was amplified by primer ExA (5′-AGCAAGCTT GATTTAGGTGAC-3′) and primer ExB (5′-CACCTGGTTCTTCATGACGGC-3′). p300 Physically Interacts with RUNX3—To detect interactions between p300 and the RUNX proteins, RUNX1, RUNX2, and RUNX3 were transfected into 293 cells and then analyzed by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. In this transient analysis, the endogenous p300 protein was detected in RUNX immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1C, left panel), whereas RUNX3 protein was detected in p300 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1C, right panel). These results indicate that p300 interacts with RUNX2 and RUNX3 as well as RUNX1. To identify the regions in p300 and RUNX3 that are involved in the interaction, RUNX3 and p300 (full-length or deletion derivatives) were co-expressed in 293 cells and analyzed by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. A schematic representation of the RUNX3 and p300 proteins and their deletion derivatives is shown in Fig. 1, A and B. The binding data show that p300 interacts with the Runt domain and the C-terminal region of RUNX3 (Fig. 1D). It was previously reported that the C-terminal region of RUNX1 is responsible for the induction of cell differentiation and for interaction with the N-terminal region of p300 (13Inoue K. Ozaki S. Shiga T. Ito K. Masuda T. Okado N. Iseda T. Kawaguchi S. Ogawa M. Bae S.C. Yamashita N. Itohara S. Kudo N. Ito Y. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 946-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Additionally, we found that RUNX3, as well as RUNX1, interacts with p300. The regions responsible for the interaction of p300 and RUNX3 were mapped to the N terminus (p300–1: a.a. 1–565) and C terminus (p300–4: a.a. 963–2369) of p300 and to the Runt domain and C terminus of RUNX3 (Fig. 1E). p300 Acetylates RUNX Proteins—Based on our observation that the C-terminal region of p300, which contains the HAT domain, interacts with RUNX proteins, we asked whether p300 could also acetylate RUNX3. Lysates of cells expressing p300 and Myc-tagged RUNX3 were immunoprecipitated with anti-acetyl-lysine antibodies, and the immunoprecipitates were Western blotted with the anti-Myc antibody. This experiment revealed that p300 acetylates RUNX3 (Fig. 2A). RUNX3 contains eight highly conserved lysine residues that are potential acetylation sites: one in the N-terminal region, six in the Runt domain, and one in the C-terminal region (Fig. 2C). To identify which lysine residue(s) is/are acetylated in a p300-dependent manner, a series of RUNX3 deletion mutants was co-expressed with p300 in 293 cells and monitored by immunoprecipitation assay using an anti-acetyl-lysine antibody. Acetylation was detected within the Runt domain and the C-terminal region of RUNX3 (Fig. 2A). To identify the precise targets of acetylation, RUNX3 mutants with lysine to arginine (KR) substitutions were tested for p300-dependent acetylation in 293 cells. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis showed that the doubly mutated RUNX3-K148R,K192R and RUNX3-K186R,K192R proteins exhibited a marked decrease in acetylation (Fig. 2B). This result suggests that the Lys-148, -186, and -192 residues of RUNX3 are the major targets of the acetyltransferase activity of p300. In support of this result, mutation of these three lysine residues (RUNX3-K148R, K186R, and K192R) abrogated the acetylation signal (Fig. 2B). In Fig. 2C, the circles represent the RUNX3 acetylation sites. These mutations apparently do not affect the ability of RUNX3 to interact with DNA (Fig. 2D) or with other proteins, including PEBP2β/CBFβ, Smad3, and p300 (Fig. 2E). RUNX3 Acetylation Is Controlled by the HDAC-dependent Pathway—Our finding that RUNX3 is acetylated by p300 raised the possibility that there is a deacetylation mechanism. Therefore, we examined whether any of the HDACs (HDAC1, -2, -4, and -5) could remove the acetyl moiety from acetylated RUNX3. Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting analysis revealed that RUNX3 interacts with HDAC1, -2, and -5 and to a lesser degree with HDAC4 (Fig. 3A). The effect of these HDACs on RUNX3 acetylation was then analyzed by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. The level of RUNX3 was decreased by the HDACs (Fig. 3B). RUNX3 was more effectively deacetylated by Class II HDACs (HDAC4, -5) than by class I HDACs (HDAC1, -2). Interestingly, for reasons that remain unclear, HDAC4 showed only very weak affinity to RUNX3 yet quite high RUNX3 deacetylation activity comparable with HDAC5 (Fig. 3, A and B). Further analysis of the precise binding domains between HDACs and RUNX3 may provide a clue to resolve this discrepancy. We examined whether RUNX3 colocalizes with HDAC5 by an immunohistochemical study. HDAC5 was detected in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, whereas RUNX3 was found exclusively in the nuclei of 293 cells. When HDAC5 and RUNX3 were cotransfected, nuclear HDAC5 was found to colocalize with RUNX3 (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, in some cells that strongly expressed RUNX3, HDAC5 was detected only in the nucleus. These results suggest that HDAC5 and RUNX3 physically interact and colocalize in the nucleus in vivo. The TGF-β Signaling Pathway Stimulates the p300-mediated Acetylation of RUNX3—Runt domain transcription factors are important targets for TGF-β superfamily signaling. To determine whether the TGF-β signaling pathway influences the acetylation and/or deacetylation of RUNX3, 293 cells were transfected with RUNX3 in the presence or absence of p300 and treated with TGF-β or the HDAC inhibitor TSA. Notably, the level of RUNX3 acetylation was enhanced not only by p300 coexpression but also by TGF-β and TSA treatment (Fig. 4A). Combining these effectors further increased the level of RUNX3 acetylation. RUNX3 acetylation by TGF-β was effectively reversed by HDAC5 (Fig. 4B). On the other hand, the RUNX3 K148R,K186R,K192R mutants showed a significantly reduced level of acetylation by p300 and/or TGF-β (Fig. 4B). This result suggests that p300 and the HDACs are the physiological effectors that control RUNX3 acetylation and that the TGF-β superfamily signaling pathway favors acetylation over deacetylation. Acetylation of RUNX3 Inhibits Its Degradation—Interestingly, we observed that the level of RUNX3 expression increased in proportion to the level of acetylation (Fig. 4A). To test whether p300-dependent acetylation affects the stability of RUNX3, RUNX3 was expressed in 293 cells in the presence or absence of p300; the level of protein, as measured by Western blotting, was found to be much higher in the presence of p300 (Fig. 5A, left panel). To confirm these observations, a fixed amount of RUNX3 was expressed alone or with increasing amounts of p300. In this transient assay, the level of RUNX3 dramatically increased in proportion to the amount of input p300 (Fig. 5A, right panel). To elucidate the mechanism underlying this phenomenon, the stabilities of wild-type RUNX3 and RUNX3-K148R,K186R,K192R were examined. Wild-type RUNX3 was quickly degraded, whereas p300 protected RUNX3 from degradation (Fig. 5B, left panel). In contrast, the RUNX3 KR protein was much more stable than wild-type RUNX3 and co-expression of p300 did not further increase its stability (Fig. 5B, right panel). These results suggest that these lysine residues are responsible for RUNX3 degradation and that acetylation by p300 protects the protein by masking these residues from ubiquitination. This interpretation led us to examine whether the deacetylation of RUNX3 by HDACs would decrease its stability. In support of our hypothesis, co-expression of HDAC5 destabilized RUNX3 but co-expression of p300 counteracted this effect and increased the stability of RUNX3 (Fig. 5C). Acetylation Protects RUNX3 from Smurf-mediated Degradation—C-terminal truncation of RUNX3 was also observed to stabilize the protein. A RUNX3 derivative that terminated at amino acid 374 (RUNX3Δ374) was expressed at a level similar to that of wild-type RUNX3, and its expression was significantly increased in the presence of p300 (Fig. 6A). However, a derivative lacking residues beyond amino acid 187 (RUNX3Δ187) exhibited significantly enhanced stability, and the presence of p300 did not further increase the level of this mutant protein (Fig. 6A). This result indicates that the region from amino acids 187 to 374 is required for degradation of RUNX3. This region contains a conserved PPXY motif (P-box; a.a. 309–312) (Fig. 1A) that is recognized by the Smurf WW domain (24Otte L. Wiedemann U. Schlegel B. Pires J.R. Beyermann M. Schmieder P. Krause G. Volkmer-Engert R. Schneider-Mergener J. Oschkinat H. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Based on this observation, we asked whether Smurf ubiquitin ligases are involved in the RUNX3 degradation pathway and whether p300 interferes with this pathway. Co-immunoprecipitation and ubiquitination assays revealed that Smurf1 and Smurf2 interact with and ubiquitinate RUNX3 (Fig. 6, B and C). Expression of increasing amounts of Smurf1 resulted in a dose-dependent decrease of RUNX3 (Fig. 6D, left panel). However, the Smurf-mediated decrease in the level of RUNX3 was reversed by the co-expression of p300 (Fig. 6D, right panel). These results suggest that p300-mediated acetylation inhibits RUNX3 ubiquitination by Smurf proteins. Interestingly, deletion of the P-box (RUNX3-del-309–312) or substitution of one of the proline residues with arginine (RUNX3-P309R) confers resistance to Smurf-mediated degradation. Similarly, the RUNX3-K148R,K186R,K192R mutant is also resistant to Smurf-mediated degradation (Fig. 6E). Taken together, our results suggest that the acetylation of lysine residues by p300 protects RUNX3 from Smurf-mediated degradation. Acetylation Increases RUNX3 Transactivation Activity—To further investigate the functional consequences of RUNX3 acetylation and deacetylation, we analyzed the effect of p300 and HDAC5 on RUNX3-mediated transcriptional activation and found that inhibition of HDAC by TSA increased the transactivation activity of RUNX3 (Fig. 7A). In the absence of RUNX3, TSA did not affect reporter activity (data not shown). p300 also increased RUNX3-mediated transactivation activity. The p300-dependent increase in RUNX3 activity is suppressed by the co-expression of HDAC5, and this suppression in turn is reversed by TSA treatment (Fig. 7A). Semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR experiments revealed that the mRNA levels of endogenous and exogenous RUNX3 were not affected by expression of HDAC5 and p300 and treatment of TSA in 293 cells (Fig. 7B). These findings suggest that acetylation is responsible for the increase in RUNX3-dependent transactivation activity. Notably, although mutation of the lysine residues targeted by p300 stabilizes the mutant proteins, these alterations significantly decrease RUNX3 transactivation activity (Fig. 7C). Coexpression of p300 does not increase the activity of the mutant RUNX3 proteins relative to the effect of p300 alone on pGL3–12-RXE-luc reporter plasmid. In agreement with the increase in RUNX3 acetylation mediated by TGF-β, the transactivation activity of RUNX3 was up-regulated by TGF-β treatment (Fig. 7D). The effect of p300 on RUNX3 transactivation activity was also further up-regulated by TGF-β. Cotransfection with HDAC5 significantly reduced the effect of TGF-β. On the other hand, the RUNX3-KR mutant showed only a minimal response to TGF-β. The RUNX family of transcriptional regulators controls lineage-specific gene expression by interacting with transcription factors such as PEBP2β/CBFβ, Smad, C/EBP, ETS, ALY, TLE, HDAC, and p300 (16Hanai J.

Biol. 1996; 16: 1231-1240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Depending on the specific promoter context, RUNX proteins can function as transcriptional activators or suppressors. Although p300 and HDAC6 have been implicated in regulating this RUNX activity (22Kitabayashi I. Yokoyama A. Shimizu K. Ohki M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2994-3004Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 23Westendorf J.J. Zaidi S.K. Cascino J.E. Kahler R. van Wijnen A.J. Lian J.B. Yoshida M. Stein G.S. Li X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7982-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), the molecular mechanisms by which they do so are poorly understood. The multifaceted transcriptional co-activator p300 plays a central role in coordinating and integrating multiple signaling events. Previously, it was thought to act mainly as a scaffold that connects different transcription factors or transcription machines, but it was recently discovered to have additional properties, such as HAT and E3 ligase activities (20Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2189) Google Scholar, 31Grossman S.R. Deato M.E. Brignone C. Chan H.M. Kung A.L. Tagami H. Nakatani Y. Livingston D.M. Science. 2003; 300: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The HAT activity of p300 allows it to influence chromatin conformation and transcriptional activities by acetylating histones or transcription factors such as GATA-1, MyoD, E2F-1, Smad7, and p53 (21Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar, 32Wade P.A. Pruss D. Wolffe A.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 128-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). The functional consequences of acetylation are diverse and include the enhancement of protein stability and, thus, transcriptional activity. For example, p53 is specifically acetylated at multiple lysine residues by p300/cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein, which inhibits its ubiquitination-mediated degradation by Mdm2 (33Ito A. Kawaguchi Y. Lai C.H. Kovacs J.J. Higashimoto Y. Appella E. Yao T.P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6236-6245Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). HDACs are often associated with co-repressor complexes and can exert their repressive effects on both histone and non-histone proteins by removing acetyl groups (34Luo J. Su F. Chen D. Shiloh A. Gu W. Nature. 2000; 408: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Deacetylation by HDACs also serves as an important step in the Mdm2-mediated degradation of p53 (34Luo J. Su F. Chen D. Shiloh A. Gu W. Nature. 2000; 408: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Here we provide evidence that the Runt domain transcription factor RUNX3 is acetylated by p300 in response to TGF-β superfamily signaling and is deacetylated by HDACs. Acetylation protects RUNX3 from Smurf-dependent degradation, which indicates that competition between acetylation and deacetylation may control the ubiquitination-dependent degradation of RUNX3. We have mapped the RUNX3 acetylation sites to three conserved lysine residues (Fig. 2C). Both acetylation by p300 and substitution of these critical lysine residues with arginine markedly increase the expression of RUNX3 (Fig. 5). However, in the absence of acetylation, these RUNX3 residues confer instability because they are targeted by ubiquitination. Evidence supporting a link between the acetylation and the ubiquitination of RUNX3 comes from previous observations that RUNX1 is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway (35Huang G. Shigesada K. Ito K. Wee H.J. Yokomizo T. Ito Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 723-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) and that RUNX2 is degraded by the ubiquitin ligase Smurf1 (36Zhao M. Qiao M. Oyajobi B.O. Mundy G.R. Chen D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27939-27944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), together with our observation that Smurf1 and Smurf2 interact with and ubiquitinate RUNX3 (Fig. 6, B and C). We also found that the PPXY motif is critical for Smurf-mediated RUNX3 degradation. Even a single amino acid substitution (proline to arginine) in the motif confers strong resistance to Smurf-mediated degradation of RUNX3 (Fig. 6E). The Smurf-mediated decrease in the level of RUNX3 protein was reversed by co-expression of p300, suggesting that acetylation by p300 stabilizes RUNX3, presumably by protecting lysine residues from ubiquitination by Smurf proteins or other E3 ligases (Fig. 6D). Furthermore, lysine to arginine substitutions significantly stabilize RUNX3, probably by blocking ubiquitination (Fig. 6E). These results strongly suggest that the competition between ubiquitination and acetylation of the same lysine residues regulates the stability of RUNX3. Our findings that HDACs deacetylate (Fig. 2) and therefore destabilize RUNX3 (Fig. 5) further support the proposed link between acetylation/deacetylation and ubiquitination. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that several components of the HDAC6 complex are involved in the ubiquitination signaling pathway (37Seigneurin-Berny D. Verdel A. Curtet S. Lemercier C. Garin J. Rousseaux S. Khochbin S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8035-8044Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Under normal cell growth conditions, the acetylation of RUNX3 protein is almost undetectable. However, acetylation becomes more evident after treatment with the HDAC inhibitor TSA (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, treatment with TSA results in RUNX-dependent transactivation (Fig. 7A). These results indicate that RUNX3 acetylation is a dynamic process regulated by acetylation and deacetylation and that HDACs are involved in this process. More importantly, the acetylation of RUNX3 is significantly increased by treatment with TGF-β and further augmented by treatment with TSA or by the transient expression of p300. An increase in the extent of RUNX3 acetylation by TGF-β leads to an increase in RUNX3 transactivation activity. On the other hand, HDAC5 decreases TGF-β-dependent RUNX3 acetylation and reverses the effect of TGF-β. These results indicate that the TGF-β signaling pathway positively regulates p300-dependent RUNX3 acetylation and RUNX3 activity. It is not yet clear whether the increase in transactivation activity is independent of the increased stability or depends on the interaction of RUNX with other transcriptional modulators, although there is no obvious difference between wild-type RUNX and the KR mutant proteins with respect to their physical interactions with PEBP2β/CBFβ, Smad3, and p300 (Fig. 2E). The molecular mechanism by which TGF-β superfamily signaling promotes p300-dependent RUNX3 acetylation remains to be determined. One possibility is that Smad proteins mediate RUNX acetylation in response to TGF-β stimulation. However, it is worth noting that TGF-β mediates the phosphorylation of Smad3 and potentiates the association between Smad proteins and p300 (38Shen X. Hu P.P. Liberati N.T. Datto M.B. Frederick J.P.

Because all RUNX proteins physically interact with TGF-β and bone morphogenetic protein-activated Smad proteins, it would be interesting to examine whether receptor-activated Smad proteins facilitate RUNX acetylation by p300 while suppressing the E3 ligase activity of p300. Collectively, our results reveal a previously unknown mechanism of RUNX3 stability, namely, acetylation and the deacetylation mediated by p300 and HDACs, respectively, that controls the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of RUNX3."
https://openalex.org/W2033111353,"The yeast open reading frames YOL027 and YPR125 and their orthologs in various eukaryotes encode proteins with a single predicted trans-membrane domain ranging in molecular mass from 45 to 85 kDa. Hemizygous deletion of their human homolog LETM1 is likely to contribute to the Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome phenotype. We show here that in yeast and human cells, these genes encode integral proteins of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Deletion of the yeast YOL027 gene (yol027Δ mutation) results in mitochondrial dysfunction. This mutant phenotype is complemented by the expression of the human LETM1 gene in yeast, indicating a functional conservation of LetM1/Yol027 proteins from yeast to man. Mutant yol027Δ mitochondria have increased cation contents, particularly K+ and low-membrane-potential Δψ. They are massively swollen in situ and refractory to potassium acetate-induced swelling in vitro, which is indicative of a defect in K+/H+ exchange activity. Thus, YOL027/LETM1 are the first genes shown to encode factors involved in both K+ homeostasis and organelle volume control.

Respiring mitochondria maintain a membrane potential (Δψ) 1The abbreviations used are: Δψ, membrane potential; KOAc, potassiumacetate; HA, hemagglutin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; YPGal, yeast extract, bacto peptone, 2% galactose; YPD, yeast extract, bacto peptone, 2% dextrose; SMP, submitochondrial particles; DCCD, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide; JC-1, 5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide; TES, N-tris(hydroxymethyl)-methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid; A23187, 4-bromo-calcium ionophore A23187; TM, transmembrane.1The abbreviations used are: Δψ, membrane potential; KOAc, potassiumacetate; HA, hemagglutin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; YPGal, yeast extract, bacto peptone, 2% galactose; YPD, yeast extract, bacto peptone, 2% dextrose; SMP, submitochondrial particles; DCCD, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide; JC-1, 5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide; TES, N-tris(hydroxymethyl)-methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid; A23187, 4-bromo-calcium ionophore A23187; TM, transmembrane. of –150 to –180 mV (Δψ, inside negative). This high Δψ constitutes a large driving force for the electrophoretic influx of cations, either through specific channels or by diffusion through the membrane. Several cation channels have been characterized physiologically (reviewed in Refs. 1Bernardi P. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1127-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar and 2Garlid K.D. Paucek P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1606: 23-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), and recently, a single one has been identified molecularly (3Kolisek M. Zsurka G. Samaj J. Weghuber J. Schweyen R.J. Schweigel M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1235-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). These transport systems seem to have intrinsic control mechanisms which ensure that the matrix cation concentrations stay within physiological ranges, far below chemical equilibrium. Diffusive permeability of the inner mitochondrial membrane to ions is generally low but physiologically significant, as it lowers the pH gradient and membrane potential. Moreover, if not counteracted by extrusion, steadily increasing concentrations of matrix cations (and of compensating anions) will lead to an imbalance of osmotic pressure across the inner mitochondrial membrane. As a consequence, water will pass through the membrane, causing excessive swelling and eventual rupture of the organelle (1Bernardi P. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1127-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar, 2Garlid K.D. Paucek P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1606: 23-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 4Brierley G.P. Jung D.W. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1988; 20: 193-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). As first proposed by P. Mitchell (5Mitchell P. Naturwissenschaften. 1961; 191: 144-148Google Scholar), mitochondria have carrier systems allowing the electroneutral exchange of cations against H+ (and anions against OH–). These exchangers counteract the Δψ-driven cation leakage of the membrane and also cation imbalances due to changes in mitochondrial physiology. Mitochondrial cation distribution is, therefore, a steady state, in which the accumulation ratio is modulated by the relative rates of cation influx and efflux by means of separate pathways. Many physiological studies have been devoted to cation/H+ exchange systems (reviewed in Ref. 1Bernardi P. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1127-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar). With respect to the most abundant cations in cells and mitochondria, K+ (150 mm) and Na+ (5 mm), researchers agree on the existence of two separate antiporters in mammalian cells, a selective Na+/H+ exchanger, and an unselective K+/H+ exchanger transporting virtually all alkali ions. Given the particularly high concentration of K+ in cells and mitochondria, the unselective exchanger is referred to most commonly as the K+/H+ exchanger (reviewed in Ref. 1Bernardi P. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1127-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar). This exchanger has pronounced sensitivity to matrix [Mg2+](Ki of 0.3–0.4 mm in mammalian mitochondria), timolol, and quinine. Proteins of apparent molecular masses of 82 and 59 kDa constitute the unselective mitochondrial K+/H+ exchanger and the selective Na+/H+ exchanger, respectively (6Li X.Q. Hegazy M.G. Mahdi F.

Rao R. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C1031-C1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In the course of characterizing a set of yeast genes potentially encoding mitochondrial cation transport proteins (10Waldherr M. Ragnini A. Jank B. Teply R. Wiesenberger G. Schweyen R.J. Curr. Genet. 1993; 24: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) we focused on the yeast genes MRS7 and YOL027, as well as their human homolog LETM1 (leucine zipper/EF-hand-containing trans-membrane domain; Ref. 11Endele S. Fuhry M. Pak S.J. Zabel B.U. Winterpacht A. Genomics. 1999; 60: 218-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), which are representatives of a novel eukaryotic gene family with hitherto unknown function. Hemizygous deletion of a region on human chromosome 4 (4p16.3), including LETM1 and several other genes, causes the Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome. Recent data reveal that the full Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome phenotype, including neuromuscular features, such as seizures correlates with the deletion of the LETM1 gene (12Zollino M. Lecce R.

We report here on the mitochondrial localization of the human LetM1 protein and of its yeast homologs, Yol027p and Ypr125p (Mrs7p), on their functional homology, and on the effects resulting from the disruption of the yeast genes on mitochondrial functions. The results indicate a role of Yol027p in mitochondrial K+ homeostasis. As compared with wild-type mitochondria, mutant yol027Δ mitochondria exhibit severely reduced potassium acetate (KOAc)-induced swelling, which is indicative of a lack or reduction in K+/H+-exchange activity. We discuss the possibility that YOL027 encodes either the K+/H+ exchanger itself or an essential cofactor thereof. Strains, Plasmids, and Media—The following strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were used: GA74–1A (13Bui D.M. Gregan J. Jarosch E. Ragnini A. Schweyen R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20438-20443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), DBY747 (ATCC no. 204659), and W303 (ATCC no. 201239), all of which served as wild-type strains, and DBY747 mrs2Δ (14Wiesenberger G. Waldherr M. Schweyen R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6963-6969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast growth media were as described previously (14Wiesenberger G. Waldherr M. Schweyen R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6963-6969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hemagglutin (HA)-tagged and Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)-tagged Genes—A transposon-tagged YOL027c-containing DNA fragment (15Ross-Macdonald P. Coelho P.S. Roemer T. Agarwal S. Kumar A. Jansen R. Cheung K.H. Sheehan A. Symoniatis D. Umansky L. Heidtman M. Nelson F.K. Iwasaki H. Hager K. Gerstein M. Miller P. Roeder G.S. Snyder M. Nature. 1999; 402: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) was used to replace the chromosomal copy of YOL027c in strain GA74–1A. Upon Cre-mediated recombination, a variant of the YOL027c gene was obtained which had a triple HA-tag inserted inframe after codon 469. This HA-tagged version of the YOL027c gene had no apparent phenotypic effect on the growth of the mutant strain compared with the isogenic wild-type strain. The YOL027c gene sequence (nucleotides –426 (relative to the start codon) to +1721) was PCR-amplified from W303 genomic DNA by use of an oligonucleotide 5′ primer carrying a natural SacI site and a 3′ primer that introduced a PstI site upstream of the stop codon. The SacI-PstI fragment of this product was inserted into YCp33-HA vector, resulting in plasmid YCp-YOL027-HA. YPR125 coding sequence (1356 nucleotides from 1 to +1356) was PCR-amplified from the same yeast strain, introducing recognition sites for EcoRI and SalI, followed by insertion of this fragment into the EcoRI and SalI sites of the centromeric vector pUG35. The resulting plasmid pUG35-YPR125-GFP expressed the YPR125 gene under the MET25 promoter and in-frame with the GFP coding sequence following at its 3′ end. The YEp-YPR125 construct (YEp-MW7) had been cloned by Waldherr et al. (10Waldherr M. Ragnini A. Jank B. Teply R. Wiesenberger G. Schweyen R.J. Curr. Genet. 1993; 24: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To clone the human LETM1 cDNA, SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and an oligo(dT) primer were used for first-strand synthesis on poly(A)-enriched template RNA isolated from a PA-1 human teratocarcinoma cell line. PCR fragments covering the entire coding sequences (from nucleotide 1 to +2590) were amplified, and the purified PCR product was cloned to the pGEM-T vector (Promega), and a C-terminal HA-tag was added by PCR. The PCR product was digested with XhoI and HindIII and cloned into the corresponding sites of the yeast expression vector, pVT103-U. An XhoI-EcoRI PCR fragment was cloned into the pEGFP-N1 mammalian expression vector, thus creating an in-frame fusion with the enhanced GFP (EGFP) sequence carried on the vector. Gene Deletion—Complete disruptions of YOL027, MRS2, and MRS7 were performed according to the one-step replacement protocol described in Ref. 16Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2232) Google Scholar in the diploid yeast strain W303 and the haploid DBY747. Disruption of YOL027 resulted in a deletion of 1702 nucleotides (from the start codon to nucleotide –19, relative to the stop codon) of the YOL027 open reading frame (named yol027Δ mutant). Spores derived from this diploid strain were found to be viable. A disruption of the same size then was obtained in DBY747 (haploid). Disruption of the open reading frames MRS2 (mrs2Δ) and MRS7 (mrs7Δ) resulted in deletions of 1218 nucleotides (from nucleotide –49 relative to the start codon to nucleotide –243 relative to the stop codon) and of 1356 nucleotides (from the start to the stop codon). 2L. Zotova, unpublished data. W303 yol027Δmrs2Δ and yol027Δmrs7Δ double-mutant strains were then obtained by crossing the yol027Δ strain with the mrs2Δ or ypr125Δ strain, respectively. Diploids were sporulated, and the haploid double mutants were identified among the meiotic progeny by screening for the appropriate combination of disruption markers. Isolation and Subfractionation of Mitochondria—GA74–1A were grown in lactate medium (17Daum G. Bohni P.C. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13028-13033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), W303 cells in complete YPGal medium or synthetic S-galactopyranoside (S-Gal) medium containing 2% galactose. Strain DBY747 was cultivated in YPD medium. For ion-influx measurements, cells were grown to stationary phase; for all other applications, cells were harvested at A600 of 1. Mitochondria were prepared according to Ref. 18Zinser E. Daum G. Yeast. 1995; 11: 493-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar and suspended in breaking buffer (0.6 m sorbitol HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4) prior to further use. Na2CO3 extraction of proteins from membranes and mitoplast preparation was as described in Refs. 20Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar and 18Zinser E. Daum G. Yeast. 1995; 11: 493-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, respectively. Yeast mitochondria obtained by differential centrifugation were diluted to a protein concentration of 10 mg/ml with 10 mm HEPES-Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, and a final osmolarity of 0.1 m. After a 20-min incubation on ice, the resulting mitoplasts were collected by centrifugation (40,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C). To obtain submitochondrial particles (SMP), mitoplasts were resuspended in sucrose buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4). The mitoplast suspension was sonified for 3 min with maximum intensity in a Bandelin sonicator UW70/GM70. After removing unbroken mitochondria (10-min centrifugation at 10,000 × g), SMPs were collected by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h and resuspended in 1 ml of sucrose buffer. Antibodies used for immunodetection were as described in Ref. 19Jarosch E. Tuller G. Daum G. Waldherr M. Voskova A. Schweyen R.J. J. Biol.

For fluorimetric determination of cation concentrations, measurements of matrix concentrations of free Mg2+ and Ca2+ ([Mg2+]m and [Ca2+]m) were performed in mitochondria from the DBY747 background as described in Ref. 3Kolisek M.

KOAc-induced Swelling of Isolated Mitochondria—Mitochondria were prepared from DBY747 or W303 wild-type cells and from isogenic yol027Δ mutant cells, resuspended in 0.6 m sorbitol buffer Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, to a final concentration of 10 mg of protein per ml. Aliquots of 100 μl of this suspension were incubated for 5 min at 25 °C with antimycin A (final concentration of 5 μm) and then transferred into cuvettes containing 1 ml of swelling buffer (55 mm KOAc, 5 mm TES, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 0.1 mm EDTA). Recording of A540 (Hitachi U-2000 spectrophotometer) was started immediately thereafter. To deplete mitochondria of endogenous Mg2+, the 4-bromo-calcium ionophore A23187 (0.5 μm) and EDTA (10 mm) were added prior to the KOAc treatment. To observe inhibition of swelling carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), quinine, or dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) (final concentrations of 0.5 μm, 200 μm, and 1 mm, respectively) were added to A23187/EDTA-treated mitochondria prior to the KOAc treatment. Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy—Cells transformed with plasmids expressing GFP fusion proteins were stained with 10 μm rhodamine B hexyl ester (Molecular Probes) or 25 nm Mito-Tracker red chloromethyl-X-rosamine and examined by laser confocal microscopy using a Leica TCS4D laser confocal microscope. GFP and rhodamine B were excited by 488 and 543 nm laser lines, respectively, and detected simultaneously at their emission maxima. Mitochondrial polarization was observed by laser confocal microscopy as described in Ref. 3Kolisek M. Zsurka G. Samaj J. Weghuber J. Schweyen R.J. Schweigel M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1235-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar. Electron Microscopy—W303 cells were grown at 28 °C in YPGal to an A600 of 1.2, fixed for 30 min in 3.7% formaldehyde, spheroblasted with zymolyase at 0.5 mg/g of cells, and washed in phosphate-buffered saline. Spheroblasts were pelleted and resuspended in 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.15 m Sorensen′s buffer (pH 7.4) for postfixation overnight at 4 °C. Subsequently, the cell suspensions were filled into cellulose tubes (200 μm in diameter), infiltrated with 1% OsO4 for 1 h, dehydrated in ethanol, and embedded in epoxy resin Agar 100 (Agar Scientific Ltd, UK). Thin sections were cut on a Reichert Ultracut S microtome, mounted on copper grids, and contrasted by uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Grids were examined at 60 kV using a JEM-1210 electron microscope (Jeol Ltd., Japan). LetM1p, YOL027p, and Ypr125p Are Members of a Novel Eukaryotic Protein Family—LETM1, a human open reading frame of unknown function, is part of most deletions in chromosome 4 causing Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome. It encodes a protein of 83.4 kDa (11Endele S. Fuhry M. Pak S.J. Zabel B.U. Winterpacht A. Genomics. 1999; 60: 218-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Homologs of this protein have been detected in all heavily sequenced eukaryotes. The genome of the yeast S. cerevisiae contains two open reading frames (YOL027 and YPR125) encoding LETM1 homologs of 573 and 454 amino acids, respectively, with about 40% sequence identity. Although the size variation among these homologs is high, lower eukaryotes, animals, and plants have at least one predicted transmembrane domain (Fig. 1A). In addition, most proteins in animals and plants have one or two predicted EF-hand calcium-binding domains in their C-terminal extensions, and the mammalian ones contain a leucine zipper region (Fig. 1A), as first noted in Ref. 11Endele S. Fuhry M. Pak S.J. Zabel B.U. Winterpacht A. Genomics. 1999; 60: 218-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar. Full-sequence alignments of homologs from plant, human, and yeast (Fig. 1B) reveal that members of this new protein family are highly conserved in their middle parts (about 40% amino acid identity). The region predicted to contain a transmembrane domain is particularly well conserved (TM, boxed in Fig. 1B). Three prolines within the putative α helical transmembrane sequence (Fig. 1C) are remarkable. Prolines, forming molecular hinges, have been observed repeatedly in transmembrane α helices of proteins, notably in ion channels and G protein-coupled receptors (21Sansom M.S. Weinstein H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 445-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). LetM1p and Ypr125p Localize to Mitochondria—The human LETM1 gene and the yeast YPR125 gene were C-terminally tagged with the GFP-epitope. The LetM1-GFP fusion protein was transiently expressed from the vector pEGFP-N1 in the mouse NIH/3T3 embryonic fibroblast cell line. Fluorescence confocal microscopy revealed the co-localization of the GFP fluorescence with Mito-Tracker fluorescence of mitochondria (Fig. 2, a–c). When expressed under control of the methionine promoter from a yeast low-copy plasmid (pUG35), the Ypr125-GFP fusion protein co-localized with Mito-Tracker fluorescence, visualizing a distinct tubular network typical of yeast mitochondria (Fig. 2, d–f). Yol027p Is an Integral Protein of Mitochondrial Inner Membrane—A YOL027-HA allele (triple HA tag C-terminally fused to the YOL027 open reading frame and inserted at the chromosomal locus; see “Experimental Procedures”) was used to determine the subcellular localization of Yol027p by cell fractionation and immunoblotting. Total cell content (T), post-mitochondrial supernatant (C), and mitochondrial (M) fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig. 3A, lanes T, C, M). The cytosolic fraction was characterized by the presence of hexokinase Hxk1p, a soluble protein. Yol027-HAp was found exclusively in the total cell content and mitochondrial fractions, as were the ADP/ATP carrier Aac2p, an integral protein of the inner membrane, and the β subunit of the F1 ATPase, F1β, a protein associated with the matrix side of the inner membrane. Treatment of mitochondria by alkaline sodium carbonate (20Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar) solubilized the membrane-associated ATPase subunit F1β (Fig. 3A, lane SN), but not the integral membrane protein Aac2p (Fig. 3A, lane P). Yol027-HA protein also stayed in the pellet fraction, thus qualifying it as an integral membrane protein. Cell fractionation, sodium carbonate extraction, and immunoblotting also revealed that Ypr125-GFP and LetM1-GFP behaved as integral proteins of a mitochondrial membrane (data not shown). To further determine to which of the two mitochondrial membranes Yol027-HA localizes, whole mitochondria, mitoplasts, and SMPs of a yol027Δ mutant strain expressing a C-terminally HA-tagged Yol027 protein from a single-copy plasmid were obtained, and the accessibility of their proteins by proteinase K was studied (Fig. 3B). In whole mitochondria, all tested proteins were protease resistant, except Tom70p, an outer membrane protein protruding to the surface. Upon disintegration of the membranes by Triton X-100, all proteins were digested by proteinase K, showing that none of them was intrinsically protease-resistant. Mitoplasts were characterized by (i) the absence of Tom70p, pointing to an efficient removal of the outer membrane, (ii) by protection of the matrix-sided integral membrane protein Tim44 from degradation by proteinase K, (iii) by the degradation of Yme1p, an inner membrane protein with domains exposed to the intermembrane space and the matrix, and (iv) shortening of Aac2p, the ADP/ATP carrier, an inner mitochondrial membrane protein partially exposed to the outside of mitoplasts. Mitoplasts contained Yol027p, but in a proteinase K-resistant form, which implies that no part of this protein protrudes to the intermembrane space to such an extent that it is rendered protease-sensitive. Sonication of mitoplasts is known to result in the formation of SMPs with a majority of inside-out vesicles (22Godinot C. Gautheron D.C. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 55: 112-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Consistently, we found that Tim44p became protease-sensitive, whereas Aac2p lost its protease-sensitivity. The presence of Yol027-HA in these SMPs confirmed its nature as a membrane protein, and its protease-sensitivity indicated that it was exposed to the surface of the SMPs. This change in protease sensitivity of Yol027-HA and Aac2p indicates that sonication of mitoplasts under the conditions used here led to a very large fraction of inside-out particles, allowing the conclusion that the C terminus of Yol027p is located in the mitochondrial matrix. Disruption of the YOL027 Gene—To investigate the function of Yol027p, the YOL027 coding sequence was replaced by the HIS3MX6 cassette in the diploid yeast strain W303 (see “Experimental Procedures”). After sporulation of the resulting heterozygous strain and tetrad dissection, yol027Δ spores were found to exhibit reduced growth on non-fermentable carbon sources (YPEG) at 28 °C and nearly no growth at 37 °C (Fig. 4) and at 18 °C (data not shown). Fermentative growth of the mutant (on YPD) was also reduced, as compared with that of the isogenic wild-type (Fig. 4). When grown on glucose containing media, yol027Δ strains were mitotically unstable, throwing off rho– cells (having macro-deletions in mitochondrial DNA) at a moderate rate (data not shown). Disruption of YPR125 had no apparent phenotype. Disruption of both YOL027 and YPR125 (yol027Δ ypr125Δ mutant) led to a phenotype indistinguishable from the one exhibited by the yol027Δ mutant (data not shown). Because YOL027 and YPR125 are multicopy suppressors of the mrs2Δ petite phenotype, defective in mitochondrial Mg2+ influx (3Kolisek M. Zsurka G. Samaj J. Weghuber J. Schweyen R.J. Schweigel M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1235-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 10Waldherr M. Ragnini A. Jank B. Teply R. Wiesenberger G. Schweyen R.J. Curr. Genet. 1993; 24: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), we also investigated the phenotypes of a yol027Δ mrs2Δ double mutant. This mutant was unable to grow on non-fermentable substrate at any temperature and proved to be rhoo (devoid of mitochondrial DNA; data not shown). Simultaneous deletion of YOL027 and MRS2 thus results in a more pronounced (synthetic) growth defect than single deletions of each of these two genes. Functional Homology of Yeast and Human LetM1p—To find out if the human LetM1p is a functional homolog of Yol027p, we transformed a yol027Δ strain with a plasmid expressing the LETM1 gene from the strong, constitutive ADH1 promoter on a multicopy plasmid ((LETM1)n). As a control, the strain was also transformed with the empty plasmid and a plasmid containing the YOL027 coding region. As shown in Fig. 4, expression of (LETM1)n restored growth of the yol027Δ mutant, although not as well as expression of (YOL027)n. Apparently, LetM1p is targeted to the yeast mitochondria and can functionally replace its Yol027 homolog. The yeast homolog YPR125, expressed from a multicopy plasmid, also restored growth of the yol027Δ mutant strain (Fig. 4). Mg2+ and Ca2+ Influx into Wild-type and Mutant yol027Δ Mitochondria—Partial suppression of the mrs2Δ phenotype by (YOL027)n or by (YPR125)n suggested to us that these two proteins might be involved in mitochondrial cation homeostasis. Comparing influx of Mg2+ and Ca2+ into isolated mitochondria (3Kolisek M. Zsurka G. Samaj J. Weghuber J. Schweyen R.J. Schweigel M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1235-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), we observed a considerably reduced influx of both Mg2+ and Ca2+ into mutant yol027Δ mitochondria as compared with wild-type mitochondria (Fig. 5, A and B). Although an increase in external Mg2+ or Ca2+ elicited an initial rapid response, influx quickly ceased, leading to steady-state plateau levels considerably lower in yol027Δ than in wild-type mitochondria (Fig. 5, A and B). This result indicates to us that the Mg2+ and Ca2+ transport systems are active, but saturation of influx is reached at comparatively low intramitochondrial cation concentrations. As shown by Ref. 3Kolisek M. Zsurka G. Samaj J. Weghuber J. Schweyen R.J. Schweigel M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1235-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, the driving force for Mg2+ uptake by Mrs2p is the internally negative membrane potential Δψ of about –150 mV in mitochondria. We speculated that the absence of Yol027p might result in a reduced Δψ and, hence, reduced Mg2+ and Ca2+ influx, whereas overexpression of Yol027p might have increased Δψ and thus improve Mg2+ influx in mrs2Δ (by so far unknown pathways). In fact, addition of the exogenous cation/H+ exchanger nigericin, which is known to enhance Δψ in respiring mitochondria, was found to stimulate Mg2+ influx into yol027Δ cells to a considerable extent (Fig. 5A). Effects of yol027Δ Mutation on Mitochondrial Δψ and K+ Concentrations—To determine the Δψ of mitochondria isolated from wild-type and mutant yol027Δ cells, we used JC-1, a fluorescent imidazole cyanine dye that stays monomeric at low Δψ, has a yellowish-green fluorescence, and aggregates with increasing Δψ, thereby shifting from green to orange-red fluorescence (23Reers M. Smiley S.T. Mottola-Hartshorn C. Chen A. Lin M. Chen L.B. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 406-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6a, mitochondrial preparations of wild-type yeast cells exhibit red fluorescence, which is consistent with a high Δψ. Yellow and green spots point to heterogeneity of the membrane potential among mitochondrial particles and even within particles, a phenomenon that has previously been described for mammalian mitochondria (23Reers M. Smiley S.T. Mottola-Hartshorn C. Chen A. Lin M. Chen L.B. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 406-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). I"

It was proposed earlier that the bacA gene product may confer resistance to the antibiotic by phosphorylation of undecaprenol (Cain, B. D., Norton, P. J., Eubanks, W., Nick, H. S., and Allen, C. M. (1983) J. Bacteriol. 175, 3784–3789). In the present work, this extremely hydrophobic membrane protein was overproduced and purified to near homogeneity. The analysis of its catalytic properties clearly demonstrated that the purified BacA protein exhibited undecaprenyl pyrophosphate phosphatase activity but not undecaprenol phosphokinase activity. This finding was perfectly consistent with the mechanism of action of bacitracin that consists in the sequestration of undecaprenyl pyrophosphate, the BacA enzyme substrate. The level of undecaprenyl pyrophosphate phosphatase was increased by 280-fold in cells carrying bacA on a multicopy expression plasmid. It was decreased by ∼75% but was not completely abolished in a bacA disruption mutant, suggesting that BacA is the main E. coli undecaprenyl pyrophosphate phosphatase but that other protein(s) exhibiting such an activity should exist to account for the residual activity and viability of the mutant strain. This is the first gene encoding undecaprenyl pyrophosphate phosphatase identified to date. Considering its newly identified function, we propose to rename the bacA gene uppP.

Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4144-4156Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). This carrier lipid enables the transport of hydrophilic precursors through the hydrophobic environment of the membrane to the externally located sites of polymerization. Because a single lipid participates in the synthesis of various wall polymers, C55-P has been considered previously to be a potential site of control over the synthesis of these polymers that prevents an imbalance in the formation of the cell envelope as a whole (6Anderson R.G. Hussey H. Baddiley J. Biochem. J. 1972; 127: 11-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, our knowledge of C55-P metabolism remains very limited and based on fragmentary data obtained from various bacterial species (Scheme 1). The precursor for C55-P, undecaprenyl pyrophosphate (C55-PP), is synthesized by addition of isoprene units onto farnesyl pyrophosphate (Scheme 1, step 1). This reaction is catalyzed by a cis-prenyl pyrophosphate synthase that has been characterized in detail both biochemically and structurally (7Allen C.M. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 110: 281-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 8Apfel C.M. Takacs B. Fountoulakis M. Stieger M. Keck W. J.

A. 2001; 98: 4337-4342Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The dephosphorylation of C55-PP (Scheme 1, step 2) is required before the lipid carrier becomes available for use in the various biosynthetic pathways, and this reaction must also occur at the end of each cycle of polymerization reaction (e.g. of peptidoglycan) where the lipid carrier is released in the pyrophosphate form. This reaction of dephosphorylation, which is the site of action of bacitracin, is catalyzed by a membrane-bound phosphatase (12Goldman R. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 5116-5122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The intriguing presence of free undecaprenol (C55-OH) in bacterial membranes has been reported (13Higashi Y Strominger J.L. Sweeley C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 3697-3702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It could represent a reserve pool for the regulation of the C55-P pool, a hypothesis that seems to be corroborated by the detection of two membrane-associated enzyme activities, an undecaprenol phosphokinase and an undecaprenyl phosphate phosphatase, catalyzing the interconversion of C55-OH and C55-P (Scheme 1, steps 3 and 4). Few data on genes and enzymes involved in steps 2, 3, and 4 are available (14Willoughby E. Highasi Y. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 5113-5115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kalin J.R. Allen Jr., C.M. Biochim. Biophys.

Recently, as discussed below, the Escherichia coli gene for the undecaprenol phosphokinase was tentatively identified as bacA (18Cain B.D. Norton P.J. Eubanks W. Nick H.S. Allen C.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3784-3789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bacitracin is a mixture of related cyclic polypeptide antibiotics produced by some strains of Bacillus licheniformis and Bacillus subtilis. This potent antibiotic is used clinically for treatments of surface tissue infections in combination with other antimicrobial drugs. Its primary mode of action is the inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis through sequestration of the essential carrier lipid C55-PP, resulting in the loss of cell integrity and lysis (19Siewert G. Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1967; 57: 767-773Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Stone K.J. Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Storm D.R. Tipper D.J. Antibiotic Inhibitors of Bacterial Cell Wall Synthesis. Pergamon Press, Inc., Elmsford, NY1987: 101-113Google Scholar). An active ATP-dependent ABC-type efflux system comprised of three BcrA, -B, and -C proteins is responsible for the resistance of B. licheniformis to the antibiotic (23Podlesek Z. Comino A. Herzog-Velikonja B. Zgur-Bertok D. Komel R. Grabnar M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 969-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 24Podlesek Z. Comino A. Herzog-Velikonja B. Grabnar M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 188: 103-106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, little is known on the mechanisms developed by sensitive bacteria to resist bacitracin. In E. coli and some other Gram-negative bacteria, different mutations that block the synthesis of exopolysaccharides have been shown to also lead to bacitracin resistance (25Fiedler W. Rotering H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14684-14689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Pollock T.J. Thorne L. Yamazaki M. Mikolajczak M.J. Armentrout R.W. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6229-6237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Presumably the synthesis of these non-essential polymers also requires the same C55-P transporter, and these mutations therefore indirectly provide an increased supply of this transporter for the synthesis of the essential cell wall component, peptidoglycan. Two E. coli genes whose overexpression in plasmids confers bacitracin resistance have been recently identified. The first one, bcrC, encodes a homologue of the BcrC subunit of the bacitracin transport permease from B. licheniformis, but the mechanism by which increased expression of this gene product modulates antibiotic resistance is yet unknown (27Harel Y.M. Bailone A. Bibi E. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6176-6178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of the second gene, bacA, has been shown to confer a moderate 4-fold increase of undecaprenol phosphokinase activity in membranes, and it was thus hypothesized that this gene codes for the latter enzyme activity (18Cain B.D. Norton P.J. Eubanks W. Nick H.S. Allen C.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3784-3789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Homologues of bacA have since been identified in Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae (28Chalker A.F. Ingraham K.A. Lunsford R.D. Bryant A.P. Bryant J. Wallis N.G. Broskey J.P. Pearson S.C. Holmes D.J. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 1547-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Although bacA appears to be non-essential for in vitro growth of these two pathogenic organisms, its inactivation results in increased bacitracin susceptibility and reduced virulence with the maximal effects being observed in S. pneumoniae (28Chalker A.F. Ingraham K.A. Lunsford R.D. Bryant A.P. Bryant J. Wallis N.G. Broskey J.P. Pearson S.C. Holmes D.J. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 1547-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In fact, no demonstration that the E. coli bacA gene is also non-essential for growth has been presented to date. Attempts to disrupt its homologue in the B. subtilis chromosome have been reported recently to be unsuccessful, suggesting that bacA is essential in the latter species (29Cao M. Helmann J.D. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6123-6129Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Furthermore, with only one exception (18Cain B.D. Norton P.J. Eubanks W. Nick H.S. Allen C.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3784-3789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), none of the different previous reports on bacA include any data on the biochemical and functional characterization of the gene product. As mentioned by Cain and co-workers (18Cain B.D. Norton P.J. Eubanks W. Nick H.S. Allen C.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3784-3789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although suggestive, the evidence provided in their report was not sufficient to conclude that the bacA gene encodes undecaprenol phosphokinase. It was thus necessary to reinvestigate the function of BacA by performing the complete set of experiments in a single bacterial species. This report describes such experiments performed in E. coli. The bacA gene was proved to be non-essential for growth, and the effects of its expression on bacitracin resistance were described. The BacA membrane protein was overproduced, extracted from membranes with a detergent, and purified to near homogeneity in the histidine-tagged form. Appropriate enzymatic assays showed that BacA does not exhibit undecaprenol phosphokinase activity but does exhibit undecaprenyl pyrophosphate phosphatase activity, a finding that is perfectly consistent with the associated bacitracin resistance phenotype. The E. coli strains DH5α (supE44 ΔlacU169 hsdR17 recA1 endA1 gyrA96 thi-1 relA1 Φ80 dlacZ ΔM15) (Invitrogen) and JM83 (ara Δ[lac-proAB] rpsL thi ϕ80 dlacZ ΔM15) (30Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11449) Google Scholar) were used as hosts for plasmids. The C43(DE3) strain used for the overproduction of the BacA protein was obtained from Avidis-France. The plasmid vector pTrc99A was obtained from Amersham Biosciences, and the construction of pTrcHis30 has been described previously (31Pompeo F. van Heijenoort J. Mengin-Lecreulx D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4799-4803Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The construction of plasmid pET2130, a pET21d (Novagen) derivative for expression of proteins with an N-terminal His6 tag, is detailed below. The BW25113 strain and the pKD3, pKD4, pKD46, and pCP20 plasmids used for gene disruption experiments (32Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11042) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by B. Wanner via the E. coli Genetic Stock Center (Yale University, New Haven, CT). The construction of the BW25113 ΔbacA::CmR strain is described below. 2YT (33Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 431-435Google Scholar) was used as culture medium, and growth was monitored at 600 nm with a Shimadzu UV-1601 spectrophotometer. For strains carrying drug resistance genes, ampicillin, kanamycin, and chloramphenicol were used at the concentrations of 100, 35, and 25 μg·ml–1, respectively. PCR amplification of genes from the E. coli chromosome was performed in a Thermocycler 60 apparatus (Bio-med) using the polymerase Expand-Fidelity from Roche Applied Science. The DNA fragments were purified using the Wizard PCR Preps DNA purification kit (Promega). Small and large scale plasmid isolations were carried out by the alkaline lysis method, and standard procedures for endonuclease digestions, ligation, and agarose electrophoresis were used (34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). E. coli cells were made competent for transformation with plasmid DNA by the method of Dagert and Ehrlich (35Dagert M. Ehrlich S.D. Gene (Amst.). 1979; 6: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). A first plasmid suitable for overproduction of wild-type BacA was constructed as follows. PCR primers (Table I) were designed to incorporate a BspHI site 5′ to the initiation codon of bacA (primer Bac1) and a PstI site 3′ to the gene after the stop codon (primer Bac2). The DNA fragment amplified from the E. coli chromosome was treated with BspHI and PstI and ligated between the compatible NcoI and PstI sites of vector pTrc99A. The resulting plasmid, pTrcBac1, allowed expression of the wild-type bacA gene under the control of the strong isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)-inducible trc promoter. For expression of BacA in an N-terminal His6-tagged form, the gene was amplified with primers Bac2 and Bac3 (Table I), and the resulting fragment was cut with BamHI and PstI and inserted between the same sites of vector pTrcHis30, generating plasmid pTrcBac30.Table IOligonucleotides used in this studyOligonucleotideSequenceaRestriction sites are indicated in bold, and initiation codons of uppS and bacA genes are underlined (see the text for details).Upp1AAAGGATCCATGTTGTCTGCTACTCAACCACTTAGUpp2GGCGAAGCTTCAGCAAAAGCGACCCCCATCAGGCBac1TTATTCATGAGCGATATGCACTCGCTGCTGATAGCBac2GCCTCTGCAGTCGTTGACAACGCCAAGCATCCGACBac3GGGTGGATCCATGAGCGATATGCACTCGCTGCTGATAGInact1TGCACTCGCTGCTGATAGCGGCAATATTGGGTGTGGTCGAAGGATTGACGTGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTCInact2CGGTGATAAACCCAACGGCAAACATCGGGATATCGCCGCTTGTCAGGAACATATGAATATCCTCCTTAGa Restriction sites are indicated in bold, and initiation codons of uppS and bacA genes are underlined (see the text for details). Open table in a new tab A plasmid allowing expression of the uppS gene from E. coli in the His6-tagged form under control of the T7 promoter was constructed as follows. First a vector, pET2130, was constructed that was derived from pET21d (Novagen) by removal (filling in) of its unique BglII site and replacement of the NcoI-HindIII polylinker by that from the pQE30 vector (Qiagen) as described previously for the construction of pTrcHis30 (31Pompeo F. van Heijenoort J. Mengin-Lecreulx D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4799-4803Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Primers Upp1 and Upp2 (Table I) were designed to incorporate a BamHI site 5′ to the initiation codon of the uppS gene and a HindIII site 3′ to the stop codon. The amplified fragment was treated with BamHI and HindIII and cloned between the same sites of vector pET2130, generating plasmid pETUppS. DNA sequencing was performed in all cases to confirm that the sequence of the cloned fragments was correct. The E. coli mutant strain BW25113 ΔbacA::CmR carrying a complete deletion of the bacA gene, which had been replaced by a chloramphenicol resistance gene, was created by following the method of Datsenko and Wanner (32Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11042) Google Scholar). The Inact1 and Inact2 oligonucleotides (Table I) were used for PCR amplification of the antibiotic resistance gene from pKD3 flanked by sequences designed for specific disruption of the bacA gene. The PCR product was transformed by electroporation into BW25113(pKD46) cells that express phage λ Red recombinase (32Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11042) Google Scholar). Chloramphenicol-resistant clones were isolated, and the disruption of the bacA gene in the chromosome was verified by PCR using the Bac1 and Bac2 primers. E. coli cells carrying plasmids described in this work were grown at 37 °C in 2YT-ampicillin medium (1-liter cultures). When the optical density of the culture reached 0.15, IPTG was added at a final concentration of 1 mm, and growth was continued for 16 h. Cells were harvested and washed with 40 ml of cold 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol (buffer A). The cell pellet was suspended in 12 ml of the same buffer, and cells were disrupted by sonication in the cold (Bioblock Vibracell sonicator, model 72412). The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 4 °C for 30 min at 200,000 × g. The pellet consisting of membranes and associated proteins (420 mg of proteins) was washed twice with buffer A and subjected to solubilization by detergent as follows. Membranes (2 g, wet weight) containing the overexpressed BacA protein were resuspended in 6 ml of buffer A supplemented with 150 mm NaCl and 20% glycerol. n-Dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DDM) (0.9%, w/v) was added, and the mixture was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with shaking. After centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, a first supernatant (DDM1) was recovered. The pellet of insoluble material was subjected again to three successive cycles of solubilization/centrifugation in the same conditions (except that DDM was used at 1%), yielding supernatants DDM2–DDM4, respectively. The His6-tagged BacA protein was purified basically following the manufacturer's recommendations (Qiagen). Solubilized membrane proteins (DDM2 extract, 70 mg of proteins) were mixed and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with nickel-nitrilotriacetate (Ni2+-NTA)-agarose (20 mg of proteins/ml of resin) pre-equilibrated in buffer B (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 300 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 0.2% DDM, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). The resin was then washed with buffer B, and protein elution was performed with increasing concentrations of imidazole from 10 to 300 mm in buffer B. Elution of the protein was followed by SDS-PAGE and enzymatic assays. Pure protein-containing fractions were concentrated and dialyzed using a Vivaspin concentrator (Vivascience) against buffer B. The E. coli uppS gene (8Apfel C.M. Takacs B. Fountoulakis M. Stieger M. Keck W. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 483-492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Kato J.-I. Fujisaki S. Nakajima K.-I. Nishimura Y.

High level overexpression and purification of this protein on Ni2+-NTA-agarose yielded about 5 mg of pure enzyme/liter of culture (data not shown). Synthesis of radiolabeled C55-PP was performed in a reaction mixture (20 μl) containing 100 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 μm farnesyl pyrophosphate, 50 μm [14C]isopentenyl pyrophosphate (2,035 Bq), and pure UppS enzyme (5 μg). After 3 h of incubation at 25 °C, the reaction was stopped by addition of 80 μl of 0.4 m NaOH. The radiolabeled C55-PP synthesized was recovered by extraction with butanol and dried under vacuum. The identity of the product was confirmed by TLC analysis as described below. Undecaprenol Phosphokinase Assay—The assay was performed in a reaction mixture (20 μl) containing, in final concentrations, 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.6 mm C55-OH, 0.2% DDM, 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (4,500 Bq), and enzyme (150 μg of protein). Undecaprenyl Pyrophosphate Phosphatase Assay—The assay was performed in a reaction mixture (20 μl) containing 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 3.9 mm DDM, 5 μm [14C]C55-PP (2,035 Bq), and enzyme. Coupled Assay with MraY—The assay was performed in a reaction mixture (20 μl) containing 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 3.9 mm DDM, 5 μm [14C]C55-PP (2,035 Bq), 0.1 mm UDP-Mur-NAc-pentapeptide, 0.4 μg of purified MraY, and BacA enzyme. In all cases, reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, and reactions were stopped by heating at 100 °C for 1 min. Substrates and reaction products were separated by TLC on precoated plates of silica gel 60 (Merck) using diisobutyl ketone/acetic acid/water (8:5:1, v/v/v) as a mobile phase. The radioactive spots were located and quantified with a radioactivity scanner (model Multi-Tracermaster LB285, Berthold-France). Commercial unlabeled compounds were detected by ultraviolet absorption or reaction with iodine vapors. The RF values observed for ATP, MurNAc-(pentapeptide)-pyrophosphoryl-undecaprenol (lipid I), C55-PP, C55-P, and C55-OH were 0, 0.2, 0.36, 0.5, and 0.98, respectively. One unit of enzyme activity corresponds to one nanomole of product formed per minute. A standard C55-PP phosphatase assay was performed as described above except that C55-PP (1 nmol) was unlabeled. After the reaction had been stopped by addition of 20 μl of 6 m pyridinium acetate, 40 μl of 1-butanol were added, and the mixture was vortexed for 2 min and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min. The organic phase was recovered, evaporated, taken up in 10 μl of 2-propanol/methanol (1:1, v/v), and analyzed by mass spectrometry. SDS-PAGE analysis of proteins was performed as described by Laemmli and Favre (36Laemmli U.K. Favre M. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (3024) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by using either the Bradford procedure (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214351) Google Scholar) or the QuantiPro BCA assay kit (Sigma) with bovine serum albumin as the standard and/or by quantitative amino acid analysis with a Hitachi model L8800 analyzer (ScienceTec) after hydrolysis of samples in 6 m HCl for 24 h at 105 °C. MALDI-TOF mass spectra were recorded in the linear mode with delayed extraction on a PerSeptive Voyager-DE STR instrument (Applied Biosystems) equipped with a 337 nm nitrogen laser. BacA—The samples were prepared according to Grüber et al. (38Grüber G. Godovac-Zimmermann J. Link T.A. Coskun Ü. Rizzo V.F. Betz C. Bailer S.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 298: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). 0.5 μl of BacA preparation was deposited on the plate and allowed to dry. Subsequently 0.5 μl of matrix solution (10 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid) was applied to the dried sample and again allowed to dry. Spectra were recorded in the positive ion mode at an acceleration voltage of +25 kV and an extraction delay time of 300 ns. Carbonic anhydrase was used as an external calibrant. C55-P—1 μl of matrix solution (10 mg/ml 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in 20 mm diammonium citrate) was deposited on the plate followed by 0.5 μl of sample dissolved in 2-propanol/methanol (1:1, v/v). After evaporation of the solvents, spectra were recorded in the negative ion mode at an acceleration voltage of –20 kV and an extraction delay time of 100 ns. A mixture of UDP-MurNAc, UDP-MurNAc-l-Ala, and UDP-Mur-NAc-l-Ala-d-Glu was used as an external calibrant. DNA restriction and modification enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs, and oligonucleotides were from MWG-Biotech. DNA purification kits were from Promega. C55-OH, C55-P, and C55-PP were provided by the Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics of the Polish Academy of Sciences. UDP-[U-14C]GlcNAc (9.85–11.1 GBq·mmol–1) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences, and [4-14C]isopentenyl pyrophosphate (1.5–2.2 GBq·mmol–1) and [γ-32P]ATP (111 TBq·mmol–1) were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. DDM was from Fluka, and Ni2+-NTA agarose was from Qiagen. UDP-MurNAc-peptides were prepared as described previously (39Flouret B. Mengin-Lecreulx D. van Heijenoort J. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and pure MraY translocase was prepared in the laboratory (40Bouhss A. Crouvoisier M. Blanot D. Mengin-Lecreulx D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279 (in press)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Antibiotics and reagents were from Sigma. Overexpression of bacA and Bacitracin Resistance—The wild-type E. coli bacA gene was cloned under control of the strong IPTG-inducible trc promoter in expression vector pTrc99A, yielding plasmid pTrcBac1. The effects of the overexpression of bacA on cell growth and bacitracin resistance were investigated in different E. coli host strains, DH5α, JM83, or BW25113, with similar results. Fig. 1 shows the results of experiments performed in DH5α background. In liquid medium, no particular effect on growth rate and cell morphology (as judged by optical microscopy) was observed following induction of expression of bacA. In solid medium, however, colonies of clones harboring pTrcBac1 appeared significantly more mucoid than control cell colonies. E. coli and Gram-negative species in general are not very sensitive to bacitracin. As shown in Fig. 1, lysis of control DH5α(pTrc99A) cells only occurred at relatively high concentrations of this antibiotic, i.e. 100–200 μg·ml–1. In the absence of IPTG, cells harboring the pTrcBac1 plasmid appeared slightly less sensitive than control cells to bacitracin. When IPTG (1 mm) was added 5 min before bacitracin, growth of the latter cells remained unaffected even at the highest concentration of antibiotic used (Fig. 1). This finding clearly established the tight correlation existing between bacA overexpression and bacitracin resistance in E. coli and further indicated that cell resistance to the antibiotic was a process that developed very rapidly. Overexpression of bacA Results in Increased C55-PP Phosphatase Activity—The pTrcBac30 plasmid expressing BacA in the N-terminal His6-tagged form was constructed to facilitate purification steps of the protein. The sequence of the cloned bacA gene was verified and shown to be identical to that found in data bases. Taking into account the N-terminal Met-His6-Gly-Ser extension, the molecular mas"

Activated Rac and the Rac exchange factor Tiam1 have been shown to promote the formation of adherens junctions and the accompanying induction of an epithelioid phenotype in a number of cell lines. Here we show that Madin-Darby canine kidney II cells in which Tiam1 was down-regulated using short interfering RNA disassembled their cadherin-based adhesions and acquired a flattened, migratory, and mesenchymal morphology. In addition, the expression of E1A in mesenchymal V12Ras-transformed Madin-Darby canine kidney II cells led simultaneously to the up-regulation of the Tiam1 protein, the activation of Rac, the formation of cadherin-based adhesions, and reversion to an epithelial phenotype. This finding suggests that E1A induces an epithelial morphology through the up-regulation of Tiam1 and, thereby, the activation of Rac and the formation of cadherin-based adhesions. Indeed, we found that E1A is able to induce an epithelial-like morphology accompanied by the formation of cadherin-based adhesions only in wild-type but not in Tiam1-deficient primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts. These studies indicate that the Rac activator Tiam1 is essential for the formation as well as the maintenance of cadherin-based adhesions.

These studies indicate that the Rac activator Tiam1 is essential for the formation as well as the maintenance of cadherin-based adhesions. The acquisition of a migratory and invasive ability, a hallmark of malignant epithelial cells, is predominantly caused by the loss of cell-cell adhesion. In healthy tissues, pronounced junctional complexes such as tight junctions, adherens junctions (AJs), 1The abbreviations used are: AJ, adherens junction; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblast; MET, mesenchymal to epithelial; siRNA, short interfering RNA; WT, wild-type.1The abbreviations used are: AJ, adherens junction; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblast; MET, mesenchymal to epithelial; siRNA, short interfering RNA; WT, wild-type. and desmosomes are localized to the lateral membranes of adjacent epithelial cells. These complexes mediate stable cell-cell adhesion, limit solute diffusion, and permit the development of cellular polarity. The primary adhesion molecules within AJs are cadherins whose extracellular domains interact homotypically, depending upon the presence of Ca2+ ions. The cytoplasmic tails of cadherin molecules recruit adaptor proteins termed catenins to the plasma membrane that, in turn, physically link cadherins with cortical actin filaments (reviewed in Ref. 1Perez-Moreno M. Jamora C. Fuchs E. Cell. 2003; 112: 535-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). The maintenance of AJs is indispensable for epithelial integrity. Disassembly of AJs occurs during epithelial-mesenchymal transition and is required for embryogenesis (e.g. during mesoderm or neural crest formation) and wound healing. Deregulated epithelial-mesenchymal transition underlies malignant conversion. Disassembly of AJs can be elicited by growth factor signaling, activation of certain oncoproteins, or direct inhibition of AJ components and is accompanied by increased cell migration and invasiveness (reviewed in Ref. 2Thiery J.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 442-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (5404) Google Scholar).The Rho-like molecules Cdc42, Rac, and Rho regulate the establishment and maintenance of AJs in epithelial cells (3Braga V.M.

Rac activity in particular appears to be essential for the translocation of cadherins and catenins to sites of cell-cell contact and also for the recruitment of filamentous (F-)actin to AJs (5Takaishi K.

Like Ras, Rho-like molecules cycle between an active GTP-bound form, which is capable of binding effector molecules, and an inactive GDP-bound form. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors activate Rho proteins by promoting GTP loading. We identified the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Tiam1 as a specific activator of Rac (8Habets G.G.

In Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) II epithelial cells the endogenous Tiam1 protein is localized to intercellular adhesions. Tiam1-mediated Rac activation stimulates cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion in both mesenchymal like Ras-transformed MDCKII (MDCK-f3) cells and NIH3T3 fibroblasts, limiting their migration and invasiveness (7Hordijk P.L. ten Klooster J.P. van der Kammen R.A.

Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1009-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Moreover, Ras transformation of MDCKII cells leads to down-regulation of Tiam1 and, consequently, to reduced Rac activity and a mesenchymal phenotype (11Zondag G.C. Evers E.E. ten Klooster J.P. Janssen L. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 775-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). These findings imply a role for Tiam1 in promoting cadherin-based adhesion and reveal a correlation between the acquisition of a mesenchymal phenotype and the down-regulation of Tiam1. However it is unclear whether the down-regulation of Tiam1 is responsible for the mesenchymal phenotype or merely its consequence. Nor is it known whether endogenous Tiam1 plays an essential role in the maintenance of adherens junctions.In this study we have made use of a recently developed siRNA technique (12Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3941) Google Scholar) to down-regulate endogenous Tiam1 and demonstrate its requirement in adherens junction maintenance. Furthermore, to study the requirement of Tiam1 in the establishment of cadherin-based adhesions we have used the ability of the 12 S product of adenoviral E1A to induce mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET). E1A has been shown to induce epithelial morphology in neoplastically transformed cells and cells of mesenchymal origin (reviewed in Ref. 13Frisch S.M. Mymryck J.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 441-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). E1A-induced MET corresponds to the (re)emergence of intercellular junctional complexes, reorganization of the cytoskeleton, and the restoration/institution of contact inhibition (14Frisch S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9077-9081Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 15Frisch S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1085-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We found that, following the introduction of E1A into fibroblasts or MDCK-f3 cells, de novo Tiam1 expression was induced concomitant with Rac1 activation and the formation of cadherin-based adhesions. Furthermore, by using Tiam1-deficient cells we demonstrate that Tiam1/Rac signaling is essential for the E1A-mediated formation of cadherin-based adhesions and MET, reinforcing a governing role for Tiam1/Rac in determining epithelial cell behavior.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture, Constructs, and Transfection—MDCKII cells, MDCK-f3 cells, and mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (both from Invitrogen). NIH3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's with 10% newborn calf serum (Invitrogen). The construction of pCMVE1A12S to direct the expression of the wild-type (WT) E1A 12 S protein and confer neomycin-resistance was described previously (16Hateboer G. Gennissen A. Ramos Y.F. Kerkhoven R.M. Sonntag-Buck V. Stunnenberg H.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3159-3169Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and was a kind gift of Dr. R. Bernards (The Netherlands Cancer Institute). Cells were transfected with pCMVE1A12S using Effectene (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following transfection, cells were cultured for 24 h in fresh medium prior to selection in a medium containing 0.8 mg/ml neomycin (Sigma).In Vitro Wounding Assay—Cells were grown in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum to ∼90% confluency in six wells. Subsequently, a scratch of ∼1 mm was made, and a fresh, serum-containing medium was added. Closure of the scratch was determined by phase-contrast microscopy, and images were taken 0 and 24 h after the scratch was made. Migration was quantified by measuring the relative areas that were closed by migrated cells. Means and S.E. of three independent experiments are shown.MEF Cultures—The generation of Tiam1 nullizygous mice (Tiam1–/–) has been described previously (17Malliri A. van der Kammen R.A.

MEF isolation and immortalization was performed from both WT Tiam1 and Tiam1–/– mouse embryos as described previously (18Jacobs J.J. Kieboom K. Marino S. DePinho R.A. van Lohuizen M. Nature. 1999; 397: 164-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar).Synthesis of siRNA Constructs—Oligonucleotides were designed targeting the Tiam1 RNA and luciferase RNA sequences, both containing a 9-bp hairpin loop. Oligonucleotides were annealed and cloned into the BglII/EcoRI site of pSuper (12Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3941) Google Scholar).

Subsequently, the siRNA sequence along with the H1 promoter was cloned as an EcoR1/NotI fragment into the pRetrosuper vector (19Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 243-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). Retroviruses containing each siRNA were made by transfecting the construct to Phoenix packaging cells. MDCKII cells were infected with a medium containing a retrovirus and selected on growth medium containing 1 μg/ml puromycin. In these studies total cell populations and single cell clones have been used.Immunofluorescence—Cells grown on glass coverslips were processed as described previously (10Sander E.E. ten Klooster J.P. van Delft S. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1009-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Cells were stained for N-, P-, and E-cadherins as described previously (7Hordijk P.L. ten Klooster J.P. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Oomen L.C. Collard J.G.

Images were recorded with a Leica TCS-NT confocal laser scanning microscope.Immunopreciptiation, Immunoblotting, and Northern Blotting—For Tiam1 immunoprecipitation, protein was extracted from cells using Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mmol/liter MgCl2, 100mmol/liter NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and 10% (v/v) glycerol) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin; all are from Sigma). Equivalent amounts of protein extract (quantitated using a bicinchoninic acid/CuSO4-based protein assay; Omnibabo) were incubated with 5 μl of anti-Tiam1 rabbit polyclonal serum (C16; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 20 μl of GammaBind G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 3 h at 4 °C. Beads were then washed three times in lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted in 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (50 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% (w/v) SDS, 5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue, and 10% (v/v) glycerol), resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P; Millipore). The membrane was incubated first with anti-Tiam1 antibody (αDH) (20Habets G.G. van der Kammen R.A. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Hagemeijer A. Collard J.G. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1995; 70: 48-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and subsequently with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences) and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences).For detection of cadherin and catenins, whole cell lysates were prepared in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (25 mmol/liter Hepes, pH 8, 3 mmol/liter MgCl2, 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 1mmol/liter EDTA, 1 mmol/liter dithiothreitol, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.15% (w/v) SDS, and 10% (v/v) glycerol). Protein was quantitated (as above), and equivalent amounts were resolved by SDS-PAGE and probed by immunoblotting with monoclonal antibodies against pan-cadherin (Sigma) or anti-β-catenin, E-cadherin, N-cadherin or anti-γ-catenin (all from BD Transduction Laboratories). For differential detergent solubility analysis, protein from an equivalent number of cells was first extracted in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and isolated from insoluble protein by centrifugation. Subsequently, insoluble protein remaining in the pellet was extracted by boiling in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Detergent fractions were then probed separately or pooled (to demonstrate equivalent amounts) by immunoblotting as described above. The E1A protein was detected within whole cell lysates by immunoblotting with a mouse monoclonal antibody (M73; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Ras was detected using an antibody from BD Transduction Laboratories. The detection of Tiam1 and STEF (SIF and Tiam1-like exchange factor) transcripts by Northern blotting was performed as described previously (11Zondag G.C. Evers E.E. ten Klooster J.P. Janssen L. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 775-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar).Rac and Rho Activity Assays—Rac1 and RhoA activity assays were performed as described previously (10Sander E.E. ten Klooster J.P. van Delft S. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1009-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Briefly, lysates from an equivalent number of cells were prepared and incubated with purified GST-PAK-CD (for determination of Rac1 activation status) or GST-C21 (for RhoA) bound to glutathione-coupled Sepharose beads. Following pull-down and SDS-PAGE, GTP-Rac1 or GTP-RhoA were detected by immunoblotting with anti-Rac1 (Pharmingen/BD Transduction Laboratories) or anti-RhoA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) mouse monoclonal antibodies, respectively, and subsequently by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences). Reactive proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence.RESULTSTiam1 Is Essential for the Maintenance of Adherens Junctions—Tiam1 is localized to adherens junctions in a number of epithelial cell lines, and its overexpression leads to increased E-cadherin-based adhesions (7Hordijk P.L. ten Klooster J.P. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Oomen L.C. Collard J.G. Science. 1997; 278: 1464-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). This fact indicates that Tiam1 may play an essential role in the maintenance of adherens junctions. We used siRNA to study the role of Tiam1 in the maintenance of adherens junctions in epithelial MDCKII cells. A unique 21-bp siRNA sequence targeted against canine Tiam1 mRNA was cloned under the H1 promoter into the retroviral construct pRetrosuper (see “Experimental Procedures”). Three rounds of infections were performed on MDCKII cells with retroviruses containing siRNA against Tiam1 and control siRNA against luciferase mRNA. Cells infected with Tiam1 siRNA displayed a dramatically flattened and more migratory morphology in the mass population (Fig. 1a). In addition, these cells grew more slowly than luciferase siRNA control-infected cells (Fig. 1b). This growth inhibition may favor the growth of clones that express low levels of Tiam1 siRNA and, therefore, single cell clones were also isolated. All total cell populations and single cell clones expressing decreased levels of Tiam1 displayed the flattened morphology. The effects of Tiam1 siRNA on cells resulted from an at least 50% drop in Tiam1 protein levels, as shown for two representative clones in Fig. 1c. That such a drop in Tiam1 protein levels can have significant phenotypic effects is consistent with our previous observations that Tiam1-effects are dose-dependent and that heterozygous mice have an intermediate tumor susceptibility (17Malliri A. van der Kammen R.A. Clark K. van der Valk M. Michiels F. Collard J.G. Nature. 2002; 417: 867-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). In Tiam1 siRNA-expressing cells, most of the E-cadherin was found in the cytoplasm, and much less was present in the adherens junctions (Fig. 1d), suggesting that these cells have less functional adherens junctions. Indeed, this possibility was confirmed by the increased migratory behavior of Tiam1 siRNA-expressing cells, as determined by wound healing assays showing a 2-fold increase in closure of the scratch (Fig. 1e). Additional experiments showed that hepatocyte growth factor-induced scattering was facilitated in Tiam1 siRNA cells (data not shown). These findings demonstrate that Tiam1-Rac signaling is essential for the maintenance of E-cadherin mediated cell-cell adhesions and are consistent with earlier observations that the ectopic expression of Tiam1 promotes the formation of E-cadherin-based adhesions in MDCKII cells (7Hordijk P.L. ten Klooster J.P. van der Kammen R.A.

In this study we examined whether E1A is able to induce epithelial characteristics in V12Ras-transformed MDCK-f3 cells with the intention to use it as a means to study the requirement of Tiam1/Rac signaling in the establishment of cadherin-based adhesion. MDCK-f3 cells exhibit a mesenchymal transformed phenotype and display increased motility and invasiveness compared with parental cells (21Behrens J. Mareel M.M. Van Roy F.M. Birchmeier W. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2435-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar, 22Vleminckx K. Vakaet Jr., L. Mareel M. Fiers W. Van Roy F. Cell. 1991; 66: 107-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1504) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated previously that epithelial-mesenchymal transition in these cells is caused by Ras-mediated down-regulation of Tiam1-Rac signaling (11Zondag G.C. Evers E.E. ten Klooster J.P. Janssen L. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 775-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Analysis of cell populations and a number of MDCK-f3 clones selected for sustained expression of E1A showed that they appeared to be morphologically reverted toward a more epithelial phenotype resembling that of the original MDCKII cells (Fig. 2, a and b). Importantly, these cells still express oncogenic Ras, demonstrating that their epithelioid phenotype is not the result of selection for clones that had lost exogenous V12Ras expression (Fig. 2b). The epithelioid phenotype induced by E1A is associated with the re-establishment of cadherin-based adhesions as shown by E-cadherin staining (Fig. 2c). These results demonstrate that E1A is capable of restoring E-cadherin-containing cell-cell adhesions in MDCK-f3 cells and, as a consequence, reinstate an epithelial phenotype in these cells.Fig. 2E1A expression restores cell-cell adhesions and increases Tiam1 expression and Rac activity in V12Ras transformed MDCK-f3 cells. a, cells were seeded as single cells, and colonies were photographed after 5 days of growth. b, Western blot analysis of E1A 12 S and V12Ras expression using monoclonal antibodies. c, confocal images of single cell colonies that were fixed and stained with monoclonal anti-E-cadherin antibodies. d, immunoblot analysis of immunoprecipitated Tiam1. e, Rac-GTP and Rho-GTP levels were determined by pull-down assays using GST-Pak and GST-rhotekin, respectively (see “Experimental Procedures”). Means and S.D. of three independent experiments are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We have shown previously that overexpression of Tiam1 or constitutively active Rac1 (V12Rac1) in MDCK-f3 cells leads to the emergence of an epithelioid morphology by stimulating the formation of cadherin-mediated cell-cell contacts. Moreover, following overexpression in MDCK-f3 cells Tiam1 co-localizes with E-cadherin at sites of cell-cell contact (7Hordijk P.L. ten Klooster J.P. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Oomen L.C. Collard J.G. Science. 1997; 278: 1464-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). To examine whether E1A induces MET through the modulation of Tiam1/Rac signaling, we determined Tiam1 protein levels in several MDCK-f3 E1A-expressing clones and cell populations, compared those levels with the corresponding levels in MDCK-f3 control clones, and analyzed the amount of active Rac in these clones. As shown in Fig. 2d, MDCK-f3 cells expressing E1A showed increased expression of Tiam1 accompanied by increased Rac activity (Fig. 2e). Increased Rac1 activity was associated with decreased RhoA activity (Fig. 2e) as observed previously (10Sander E.E. ten Klooster J.P. van Delft S. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1009-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar, 11Zondag G.C. Evers E.E. ten Klooster J.P. Janssen L. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 775-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the epithelioid phenotype of MDCK-f3 E1A-expressing cells is the result of the up-regulation of Tiam1 and, consequently, of increased Rac activity.E1A Induces Tiam1/Rac Signaling and Cadherin-based Cell-Cell Adhesions in Fibroblasts—The previous data show that E1A induces up-regulation of Tiam1/Rac signaling and cell-cell adhesions in cells expressing active V12Ras. To study the effects of E1A in cells lacking active Ras, we expressed E1A in NIH3T3 cells. These are immortalized mouse fibroblasts with a characteristic mesenchymal morphology and migratory behavior. Following transfection with E1A, cell populations and several independent clones of NIH3T3 cells with sustained expression of E1A protein were isolated. Compared with cells transfected with empty vector alone, the morphology of E1A-expressing cells appeared to be epithelioid (Fig. 3a), as has been described previously (23Drews R.E. Chan V.T. Schnipper L.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 198-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 24Drews R. Kolker M. Moran C. Sachar D. Chan V. Schnipper L. Mutat.

Even at low plating density, E1A-expressing cells grew preferentially in tightly packed colonies rather than dispersing as parental cells.Fig. 3E1A expression induces cadherin based cell-cell adhesions in NIH3T3 cells. a, control (EV; empty vector) and E1A-expressing NIH3T3 cells were grown as individual colonies and photographed. b, confocal images of single cell colonies that were fixed and stained with monoclonal anti-pan-cadherin antibodies. c, immunoblots showing expression of the indicated proteins using monoclonal antibodies. d, immunoblot showing Nonidet P-40 soluble (S) and insoluble (P) fractions of control and E1A-expressing NIH3T3 cells using a monoclonal anti-Pan-cadherin antibody. e, immunoblot showing E- and N-cadherin expression using monoclonal antibodies. f, immunoblot analysis of immunoprecipitated Tiam1. g, quantity of Rac-GTP levels as determined by pull-down assays using GST-Pak and the subsequent densitometry scanning of Western blots.

Daniel J.M. Mo Y.Y. Wu J. Zhang Z. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 225: 328-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemical staining for N- and P-cadherins (with an anti-pan-cadherin antibody) revealed increased localization of these molecules to the induced intercellular contacts in E1A-expressing clones (Fig. 3b). This finding was not due to increased steady-state protein expression levels of cadherins, β-catenin, and γ-catenin as detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 3c). Rather, following E1A expression, cadherins showed reduced solubility in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (see “Experimental Procedures”) (Fig. 3d), implying that cadherins were stabilized at the plasma membrane at sites of cell-cell contact through intimate association with the cytoskeleton (Nonidet P-40 insoluble fraction). Because the anti-pan-cadherin antibody recognizes different cadherins, we checked whether individual cadherins were up-regulated by E1A using specific antibodies. Fig. 3e shows that E-cadherin is not expressed in NIH3T3 cells and that its expression is not up-regulated by E1A. In addition, the expression of N-cadherin, the major cadherin in NIH3T3 cells, remains unchanged. Interestingly, as in E1A-expressing MDCK-f3 cells, NIH3T3 cells up-regulate Tiam1 expression and Rac1 activity upon the expression of E1A (Fig. 3, f and g). The up-regulation of Tiam1 in these cells is at the level of transcription (Fig. 3h). NIH3T3 cells also express significant levels of the closest homologue of Tiam1, the Rac exchange factor STEF. STEF mRNA is not induced by E1A expression, which suggests that Tiam1 is an important exchange factor for Rac during the E1A-induced formation of cell-cell adhesions in fibroblasts (Fig. 3h).Tiam1 Is Essential for E1A Mediated Mesenchymal-to-Epithelial Transition—The previous results further support the hypothesis that Tiam1/Rac signaling is important for the E1A-induced formation of cell-cell adhesions.

Using an in vivo ubiquitination assay and temperature-sensitive cell lines we demonstrate that Cdt1 in mammalian cells is degraded through ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis in S-phase. siRNA experiments for Geminin indicate that Cdt1 is degraded in the absence of Geminin. The N terminus of Cdt1 is required for its nuclear localization, associates with cyclin A, but is dispensable for the association of Cdt1 with Geminin in cells. This region is responsible for proteolysis of Cdt1 in S-phase. On the other hand, the N terminus-truncated Cdt1 is stable in S-phase, and associates with the licensing inhibitor, Geminin. High level expression of this form of Cdt1 brings about cells having higher DNA content. Proteasome inhibitors stabilize Cdt1 in S-phase, and the protein is detected in the nucleus in a complex with Geminin. This form of Cdt1 associates with chromatin as tightly as that of G1-cells, when no Geminin is detected. Our data show that proteolysis and Geminin binding independently inactivate Cdt1 after the onset of S-phase to prevent re-replication.

In eukaryotes, DNA replication initiates at several places along chromosomes, known as replication origins. Chromosomes must be replicated precisely once before they are separated into the two daughter cells at mitosis. Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 1The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; pre-RC, pre-replicative complex; ORC, origin-recognition complex; MCM, minichromosome maintenance; SCF, Skp1-Cdc53/Cullin1-F-box protein complex; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FACS, fluorescent-activated cell sorting; HA, hemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HU, hydroxyurea; NLS, nuclear localization signal; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; WCE, whole cell extract. in a complex with their respective cyclin partners globally control the order of cell cycle events. Both initiation of replication and prevention of re-replication are under the control of CDKs. Initiation of replication is triggered by S-phase CDKs, while re-initiation is prevented by the action of both M-phase CDKs and S-phase CDKs, until CDK activity drops at the end of mitosis (1Nurse P.

At the end of mitosis, when mitotic cyclins are degraded and CDK activity drops, origins are released from the restriction on replication and become licensed for replication by the formation of pre-replicative complexes (pre-RCs) (4Bell S. Dutta A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 333-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar, 5Diffley J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2819-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 6Stillman B. Science. 1996; 274: 1659-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Initiator proteins essential for this process, ORC (origin recognition complex), Cdc6/18, Cdt1, and MCM (mini chromosome maintenance) proteins were identified through genetic and biochemical studies using mostly yeast and a Xenopus cell-free system as model systems. Current models postulate that licensing is established through the stepwise recruitment of initiator proteins on origins of replication to form the pre-RCs (7Aparicio O. Weinstein D. Bell S.

ORC is bound to replication origins throughout the cell cycle at least in yeast, and acts as a landing pad for Cdc6/18 and Cdt1. These proteins in turn load MCM proteins on the chromatin, forming the pre-RCs. Recent studies show that additional factors, such as Yph1, Noc3, and Mcm10 are also required to establish and maintain licensing (12Homesley L. Lei M. Kawasaki Y. Sawyer S. Christensen T. Tye B.

Activation of S-phase CDK/cyclin complexes, together with the Cdc7-Dbf4 kinase, trigger the initiation of replication by unwinding the DNA and recruiting Cdc45 and replication enzymes (15Jares P.

Once replication is initiated, origin bound complexes are brought to a post-replicative state (post-RC) and origins are prevented to become re-licensed until chromosome separation is completed. An important role for the mitotic CDK in preventing re-licensing is demonstrated in yeast and mammalian cells, where its inactivation results in re-replication of chromosomal DNA (3Wuarin J. Buck V.

Biol. 1995; 5: 1257-1269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Many of the initiator proteins are targets of CDKs. Phosphorylation on these proteins results in their inhibition by, for example, degradation or re-localization to the cytoplasm. Different organisms appear to have developed variations on the modes of regulation of initiator proteins. Cdc18 of Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Cdc6 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae are phosphorylated by CDKs and recognized by the SCF ubiquitin-degradation system (28Donovan S. Harwood J. Drury L.S.

MCM proteins in S. cerevisiae are excluded from the nucleus after S-phase in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, while phosphorylation of Cdc6/18 by cyclin A in mammalian cells has been shown to target it to the cytoplasm (31Saha P.

Science. 2000; 290: 2309-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, the Orc1 subunit of ORC is specifically degraded after entry into S-phase (39Mendez J. Zou-Yang X. Kim S. Hidaka M. Tansey W. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 481-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 40Li C. DePamphilis M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Thus, eukaryotic cells have developed a redundant system to ensure that DNA replication takes place only once per cell cycle. If such controls fail, genomic instability may occur. For example, overexpression of Cdc18 in S. pombe brings about overreplication of the genome and this is enhanced when putative CDK phosphorylation sites on Cdc18 are mutated to non-phosphorylatable amino acids, while S. cerevisiae cells in which inhibitory signals on Cdc6, MCM, and Orc2 have been removed show partial re-replication (29Jallepalli P. Brown G. Muzi-Falconi M. Tien D. Kelly T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2767-2779Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 41Nishitani H. Nurse P.

In fission yeast, co-expression of Cdc18 to low levels together with Cdt1 induces re-replication, resulting in an increase of DNA content to more than 30C (10Nishitani H. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. Nurse P. Nature. 2000; 404: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). This suggests that inactivation of Cdc18 and Cdt1 must be carefully regulated during the cell cycle. In mammalian cells, Cdt1 is degraded soon after initiation (36Nishitani H. Taraviras S. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44905-44911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 38Wohlschlegel J. Dwyer B. Dhar S. Cvetic C. Walter J. Dutta A. Science. 2000; 290: 2309-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). In contrast, substantial levels of Cdc6/18 likely remain on chromatin through S and G2 (31Saha P. Chen J. Thome K.C.

In higher eukaryotes, Cdt1 is regulated by an additional mechanism. Geminin, first identified as a factor that blocks initiation of replication in a Xenopus egg cell-free system, was shown to bind to Cdt1 and prevent MCM chromatin loading (38Wohlschlegel J. Dwyer B. Dhar S. Cvetic C. Walter J. Dutta A. Science. 2000; 290: 2309-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 45Tada S. Li A. Maiorano D. Mechali M. Blow J. Nat.

These observations suggest that controlling Cdt1 is particularly important for genome stability. Cdt1 was recently reported to have an oncogenic potential when ectopically expressed in cells (47Arentson E. Faloon P. Seo J. Moon E. Studts J. Fremont D. Choi K. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1150-1158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We are interested to understand how Cdt1 regulation is achieved during the cell cycle and to gain insight into the function of Geminin in the cell. For the majority of the mammalian cell cycle, Geminin accumulates when Cdt1 levels are low (36Nishitani H. Taraviras S. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44905-44911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), suggesting that inhibition of Cdt1 by Geminin may act redundantly to its proteolysis, that Geminin binding to Cdt1 may promote its degradation, or that Geminin may have a role in addition to Cdt1 inhibition. Here, we show that Cdt1 is degraded through a ubiquitin-proteasome pathway that does not require the presence of Geminin. Cell Culture—HeLa, COS7, 293T, tsBN75, and ts41 cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. tsBN75 and ts41 cell lines were grown at the permissive temperature of 32 °C, or at the restrictive temperature of 40 °C. Synchronization of HeLa cells in S-phase by a double thymidine method or in M-phase, were performed as described (36Nishitani H. Taraviras S. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. J. Biol.

For transient transfections in COS7 cells, LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) was used, and in 293T cells, TransIT-293 (Mirus) was used. Proteasome inhibitors (MG-132, PS-I from Calbiochem and Peptide Institute) were used at 20 μm. For analysis of DNA content by flow cytometry, synchronized cells, or re-replicating ts41 cells were fixed in 50% methanol, treated with RNase A (500 μg/ml) for 1 h and stained with propidium iodide (20 μg/ml), and measured on FACScan (BD Biosciences). Plasmids—To express proteins in mammalian cells fused with nine copies of the Myc epitope (9×myc) at the N terminus, a fragment encoding 9×myc was PCR-amplified using Myc-cdc18 (10Nishitani H.

To construct pcDNA3.1–9myc-NLS-hCdt1(139-end) (shown as mycΔN in Fig. 6A), a fragment encoding for NLS-hCdt1(139-end) was amplified by PCR using primers; CCCCTCGAGAAATGGATATCCCAAAAAAGAAAAGAAAAGTAGCGCTGAAGGCCAGTGCCCAG and GGGAAGCTTGGGGAAAGGAAGACCAAAGTG, and cloned into pcDNA3.1–9myc at the XhoI-HindIII sites. pC-MV-hCdt1(141-end)NLSmyc was constructed by cloning the corresponding region into pCMV/myc/NLS (Invitrogen) between SalI and NotI sites after amplifying by PCR using primers GGGGTCGACAAGGCCAGTGCCCAGGATGC and GGGGCGGCCGCCAGCCCCTCCTCAGCACGTG. To construct pCMV-hCdt1(161-end)NLSmyc, the corresponding region of hCdt1 was PCR-amplified using primers CCCCCATGGAGCCATGTGGCGAGAAGGC and GGGGCGGCCGCCAGCCCCTCCTCAGCACGTG, cut with NcoI and NotI and cloned into pCMV/myc/NLS. pCMV-hCdt1(161-end) was constructed by replacing the SphI-NotI fragment of pCMV-hCdt1(161-end)NLS with a SphI-NotI fragment from pCR2.1-hCdt1-C described in (36Nishitani H.

The T7-tagged Geminin expression vector was previously described (36Nishitani H. Taraviras S. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. J. Biol.

To express genes as a single mRNA with NLS-GFP, the corresponding cDNAs were cloned in plasmid pC-AGGS-IRESnlsGFP, upstream of an internal ribosome binding site, which is followed by the coding sequence for NLS-GFP. Antibodies, Immunofluorescence, Immunoprecipitation, Western Blotting—Anti-hCdt1 antibodies were described previously (36Nishitani H. Taraviras S. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44905-44911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). To make anti-hGeminin antibodies, a fragment encoding hGeminin from the AflII site to the end was cloned into the pQE31 vector. The His-tagged hGeminin-(115-end) protein, purified on Nickel resin was injected into rabbits. The antibodies were affinity purified on a membrane with immobilized protein. For Western blotting, total whole cell lysates were prepared by lysing cell pellets directly in SDS-PAGE loading buffer or extracts were mixed with 3× loading buffer and boiled. Antibodies were used at the following dilutions: anti-hCdt1, 1:1500; anti-hGeminin-(115-end), 1:500; anti-hCdc6/18 (UP biology and Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 1:1000; anti-cyclin A, 1:2000; anti-cyclin B (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 1:2000; anti-cyclin E (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 1:1000; anti-hMcm3 (BD Pharmingen, 68686E), 1:2000; anti-phospho-Chk1(Ser-345) (Cell Signaling, 2341), 1:1000; anti-phospho Chk2(Thr-68) (Cell Signaling, 2661), 1:1000; anti-phospho-H2AX(Ser-139)(Upstate Biotechnology, 05-636): anti-α-tubulin (Sigma), 1:4000; anti-hOrc1(a gift from Dr. B. Stillman), 1:500. For immunofluorescence, HeLa or 293T human cells were fixed in 3.8% paraformaldehyde, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min, washed twice with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS. The cells were treated with a blocking buffer (3% bovine serum albumin in PBS) for 30 min and incubated with primary antibody in blocking buffer. The following primary antibodies were used: anti-hCdt1 (1:200), anti-Geminin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) 1:200. Cells were washed with PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 three times, and incubated with Cy3-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit and Alexa 488-conjugated donkey anti-goat antibodies for hCdt1 and hGeminin colocalizations. After washing, DNA was stained briefly with Hoechst 33258. Cell extracts for immunoprecipitation were prepared by lysing cells in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.8% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm pNPP, 20 mm NaF, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml of pepstatin A, leupeptin, and aprotinin), and clarified by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C). For λ-phosphatase treatment, the immunoprecipitated samples were washed twice with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MnCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, and treated with the enzyme following the manufacturer's instructions (Bio Labs). Chromatin Association Assay—1 × 106 HeLa cells were plated on a 100-mm dish, synchronized, and cultured as described in the text. Cells were lysed in 200 μl of buffer A (10 mm PIPES pH 6.9, 300 mm sucrose,10% glycerol, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitors, and 0.1% Triton X-100) with 50 mm NaCl and incubated for 10 min on ice. The whole cell extract (WCE) thus obtained was separated by centrifugation into soluble (S50) and insoluble (P50) fractions. The P50 fraction was resuspended in buffer A with 200 mm NaCl, incubated for 10 min, and insoluble P200 fraction was obtained by centrifugation. Each fraction was blotted with antibodies for hCdt1, Geminin, α-tubulin, Mcm3, Orc2, and Cdc6/18. RNAi Experiment—Two siRNAs used for Geminin were synthesized by Dharmacon, or constructed using Silencer siRNA construction kit (Ambion) against the coding sequences of Geminin, (Gem1): GAGAAAATGAGCTGTCCGC and (Gem2): CTGGCAGAAGTAGCAGAAC. As a control, dsRNA corresponding to the GFP gene (CGAGAAGCGCGATCACATG) was synthesized. Constructed dsRNAs were gel-purified. HeLa cells were plated at 4 × 105 cells/60-mm dish and transfected with dsRNA at 100 nm on the following day using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). At 46–48 h post-transfection, cells were collected and analyzed for DNA content by flow cytometry and for protein levels by Western blotting. To assess protein levels in S-phase, hydroxyurea (HU) (2.5 mm) was added 28 h post-transfection, cells were further incubated in the presence of hydroxyurea for 18 h and collected. Stabilization of hCdt1 in Cells That Have Defects in Ubiquitin-dependent Proteolysis—Our previous work suggested that hCdt1 is targeted for proteolysis after S-phase onset (36Nishitani H. Taraviras S. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44905-44911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Consistent with ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis, multi-ubiquitinated hCdt1 species were readily detected in anti-hCdt1 immunoprecipitates from cells co-transfected with plasmids expressing hCdt1 and ubiquitin (data not shown). To investigate this further, we used two cell lines that have temperature-sensitive defects in genes essential for ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis: tsBN75 and ts41. tsBN75 is derived from cell line BHK and has a temperature-sensitive mutation in the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 (50Nishitani H. Goto S. Kaneda F. Yamano T. Seno P. Handley A. Nishimoto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 184: 1015-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Cdt1 was barely detected in BHK cells arrested in S-phase, but was stabilized when the E1 enzyme was inactivated at the restrictive temperature of 40 °C in tsBN75 cells (data not shown). ts41 cells, derived from a Chinese hamster cell line, have a temperature-sensitive defect in the NEDD8 conjugation pathway, which is essential for the function of the Cullin-Cdc53 family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, such as SCF (48Chen Y. McPhie D. Hirschberg J. Neve R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8929-8935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 49Querido E. Blanchette P. Yan Q. Kamura T. Morrison M. Boivin D. Kaelin W. Conaway R. Conaway J. Branton P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3104-3117Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). The level of Cdt1 decreased as cells were arrested in S-phase with hydroxyurea at the permissive temperature of 32 °C (Fig. 1A, lanes 1–4), as we previously reported for HeLa cells (36Nishitani H. Taraviras S. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44905-44911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). When cultured at the non-permissive temperature of 40 °C, a significant increase in the levels of Cdt1 was observed (Fig. 1A, lanes 6–8). The same level of accumulation was observed when cells were first cultured at 32 °C and then shifted to 40 °Cforthelast4hofHU treatment (Fig. 1A, lane 5). In this cell line, a retarded migrating form of Cdt1 was notably detected, probably due to a high extent of phosphorylation of Cdt1 (see later). Similarly to HeLa cells, both Cdc6/18 and Geminin levels were high in S-phase, regardless of the incubation temperature, while Mcm3 levels were constant during the treatments. ts41 cells show a dramatic phenotype at the restrictive temperature. ts41 cells cultured at 40 °C start re-replicating their chromosomal DNA (51Handeli S. Weintraub H. Cell. 1992; 71: 599-611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Since high level expression of cdc18 and cdt1 induces re-replication in fission yeast, it was interesting to investigate the protein levels of replication initiator proteins during the course of re-replication of ts41 cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, lanes 9–12, both Cdc6/18 and Cdt1 levels were high when cells were re-replicating. On the contrary, Geminin level showed only a moderate increase. Re-replication of ts41 cells during the time course of the experiment is evident both by microscopy (Fig. 1B) and by FACS analysis (Fig. 1C). The FACS profile of re-replicating ts41 cells indicates a continuous increase in DNA content. Cell Cycle-dependent Accumulation of Cdt1 and Orc1—Orc1, the largest subunit of the Origin Recognition Complex, was recently shown to be degraded after the initiation of DNA replication (39Mendez J. Zou-Yang X. Kim S. Hidaka M. Tansey W. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 481-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 40Li C. DePamphilis M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), similar to Cdt1. We therefore wished to compare the accumulation of Cdt1 and Orc1 during the cell cycle using synchronized cell cultures of HeLa cells. In a synchronized cell culture made by double thymidine block and release, both Cdt1 and Orc1 levels were low during S-phase, and accumulated with rather similar kinetics as cells entered into the following G1-phase (Fig. 2A). In cells arrested in mitosis by treatment with nocodazole, Orc1 was not detectable, while hCdt1 was present in a hypermodified form, consistent with our previous observations (36Nishitani H. Taraviras S. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44905-44911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Upon release from the nocodazole block, Cdt1 was quickly converted to the unmodified form while Orc1 accumulated with slightly delayed kinetics during early G1 and decreased in S-phase somewhat later than Cdt1 (Fig. 2B). These differences in accumulation timing between Cdt1 and Orc1 suggest that the corresponding regulatory mechanisms may not be identical. hCdt1 Stabilized by Proteasome Inhibitor Treatment Is Located in the Nucleus in a Complex with Geminin—To gain an insight into the regulation of Cdt1 during S-phase, we wished to examine the behavior of hCdt1 stabilized in S-phase cells by treatment with proteasome inhibitors. Firstly, the subcellular localization of Cdt1 and Geminin was examined by immunofluorescence, in HeLa cells arrested in early S-phase by a double thymidine block and then further cultured for 3 h in the block with or without proteasome inhibitors (PS-INH). Consistent with Western blot analysis, Cdt1 was not detected in S-phase arrested cells in the absence of proteasome inhibitors. Geminin staining was evident in the nucleus and excluded from the nucleoli (Fig. 3A, left), similar to our previous findings for asynchronously growing cells (36Nishitani H. Taraviras S. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44905-44911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Upon proteasome inhibitor treatment of S-phase arrested cells, Cdt1 was stabilized and located in the nucleus, but excluded from the nucleoli, in a similar fashion with Geminin (Fig. 3A, right). This Cdt1 staining contrasts to our previous finding that hCdt1 antibodies stain both the nucleoplasm and the nucleoli in G1 cells from an asynchronous population (36Nishitani H. Taraviras S. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44905-44911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In cells traversing S-phase following release from a double thymidine block (early S (0–3) and late S (3–6)), Cdt1 stabilized by proteasome inhibitor treatment was similarly excluded from the nucleoli (Fig. 3B). This difference in localization is not due to the proteasome inhibitor treatment per se, since in a population of G1 cells, Cdt1 stained the whole nuclear region in the presence or absence of proteasome inhibitors. It is conceivable that Geminin binding to Cdt1 during S-phase would change the localization o"

Consequently, there is still a great need to identify and validate new molecular targets for antitumor therapy. This study focuses on mammary carcinoma, where fatty acid synthase (FAS) 1The abbreviations used are: FAS, fatty acid synthase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; FP-PEG-TAMRA, fluorophosphonate-poly-ethyleneglycol-tetramethyl rhodamine.1The abbreviations used are: FAS, fatty acid synthase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; FP-PEG-TAMRA, fluorophosphonate-poly-ethyleneglycol-tetramethyl rhodamine. has attracted considerable attention as a potential drug target. Much of the interest in FAS stems from the fact that the enzyme is up-regulated in about 50% of breast cancers and is an indicator of poor prognosis (3Alo P.L. Visca P. Marci A. Mangoni A. Botti C.

FAS is the enzyme responsible for cellular synthesis of palmitate, the precursor of long-chain nonessential fatty acids (8Tsukamoto Y. Wong H. Mattick J.S. Wakil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 15312-15322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Chirala S.S. Jayakumar A. Gu Z.W. Wakil S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Witkowski A. Smith S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2316-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). FAS, which contains seven separate enzymatic pockets, is situated as a head-to-tail dimer with the ketoacyl synthase and malonyl/acetyl transferase domains of one monomer working together with the dehydratase, enoyl reductase, ketoacyl reductase, acyl carrier protein, and thioesterase domains on the adjacent monomer (8Tsukamoto Y. Wong H. Mattick J.S. Wakil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 15312-15322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Chirala S.S. Jayakumar A. Gu Z.W. Wakil S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Witkowski A. Smith S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2316-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These enzymatic domains act sequentially to condense acetyl-CoA with malonyl-CoA to form a four-carbon intermediate. Six additional turns of the cycle of the enzyme convert this intermediate to palmitate, which is then liberated from FAS by the action of the thioesterase domain (12Mattick J.S. Nickless J. Mizugaki M. Yang C.Y. Uchiyama S. Wakil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 15300-15304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because FAS functions as a head-to-tail dimer, targeted inhibition of one of the enzymatic domains of FAS can ablate the activity of one or both FAS subunits (10Rangan V.S. Joshi A.K. Smith S.

Cerulenin, a natural product, is an antagonist of the ketoacyl synthase domain (the condensing enzyme) of FAS and functions by covalently modifying the active site cysteine, resulting in dead-end inhibition (13Moche M. Schneider G. Edwards P. Dehesh K. Lindqvist Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6031-6034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). c75, a synthetic analog of cerulenin, also targets the condensing enzyme and inhibits fatty acid synthesis (14Kuhajda F.P.

The inhibition of FAS by either cerulenin or c75 can suppress tumor cell proliferation and, in some cases, can induce tumor cell apoptosis (14Kuhajda F.P. Pizer E.S. Li J.N. Mani N.S. Frehywot G.L.

Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 1017-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These observations support the contention that FAS is a relevant drug target in oncology. However, both cerulenin and c75 are now known to have other molecular targets (21Thupari J.N. Landree L.E. Ronnett G.V. Kuhajda F.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Lawrence D.S. Smith C.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 62: 985-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), so searches for additional antagonists of FAS with better selectivity and distinct mechanisms of action are certainly warranted. We recently reported (24Kridel S.J. Axelrod F. Rozenkrantz N. Smith J.W. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 2070-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar) that Orlistat, a drug approved for treating obesity, is a rather potent and selective inhibitor of FAS in prostate carcinoma cells. The drug elicits its effects by inhibiting the thioesterase domain of FAS, which is responsible for releasing palmitate from the acyl carrier protein of the enzyme. By virtue of this activity, Orlistat slowed the growth of xenograft tumors of PC-3 prostate carcinoma cells in mice (24Kridel S.J. Axelrod F. Rozenkrantz N. Smith J.W. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 2070-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). The objective of the present study was two-fold. First, we sought to use an independent strategy to confirm that the antiproliferative effects of Orlistat result from inhibition of FAS. Second, we sought to elucidate the mechanism by which a FAS blockade interferes with tumor cell proliferation. Both Orlistat and small interfering RNA (siRNA)-targeting FAS cause a dramatic down-regulation of Skp2, a component of an E3 ubiquitin ligase that tags p27Kip1 for degradation by the proteasome. These findings mechanistically connect two biochemical pathways being explored as drug targets in cancer, fatty acid biosynthesis, and ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis.

The soluble and insoluble cell fractions were separated by ultracentrifugation at 64,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by using the BCA assay kit from Pierce. The resulting extracts were diluted in lysis buffer to yield a 1 mg/ml final protein concentration. The fluorophosphonate probes FP-PEG-TAMRA (fluorophosphonate-poly-ethyleneglycol-tetramethyl rhodamine), FP-PEG-BODIPY, and FP-PEG-biotin were synthesized and generously provided by Activx Biosciences (La Jolla, CA). Serine hydrolase activity was examined by incubating the soluble cell fractions (40 μl) with FP-PEG-TAMRA (2 μm) for 1 h at room temperature. Nonspecific labeling was monitored by denaturing samples for 10 min at 100 °C prior to labeling with FP-PEG-TAMRA. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 2× Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and resolved by SDS-10% PAGE. Fluorescent-labeled hydrolases were visualized at 605 nm using a Hitachi flatbed scanner and quantitated with Image Analysis (MiraiBio, Alameda, CA). Purification and Identification of Serine Hydrolases by Avidin-biotin Affinity Chromatography and Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) Mass Spectrometry—Serine hydrolases were identified using the FP-PEG-biotin probe (26Kidd D. Liu Y. Cravatt B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4005-4015Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell lysates were preabsorbed with avidin-agarose to reduce nonspecific binding of proteins during purification. Lysates were labeled with FP-PEG-biotin (5 μm) at room temperature for 1 h, after which proteins were separated from unincorporated FP-PEG-biotin by gel filtration on Nap 25 columns. After the addition of 0.5% SDS, the eluate was boiled for 10 min to denature proteins. Samples were diluted with 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5) and 150 mm NaCl and absorbed with avidin-agarose for 1 h at room temperature. Avidin-agarose beads were pelleted by centrifugation and washed 8× with 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Tween 20. Labeled proteins were eluted with 2× sample buffer, resolved by SDS-10% PAGE, and detected by silver staining. Specific bands were extracted and subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion and peptide mass fingerprinting with MALDI-TOF using methods described previously (27Landry F. Lombardo C.R. Smith J.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 279: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 28Harvey S. Zhang Y. Landry F. Miller C. Smith J.W. Physiol. Genomics. 2001; 5: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Inhibition of Serine Hydrolase Activity with Orlistat—Orlistat was extracted from Xenical™ capsules (Roche Applied Science) by solubilizing each pill in 1 ml of ethanol. Insoluble product was removed by centrifugation (14,000 rpm for 5 min). The supernatant yielded a solution of Orlistat (250 mm), which was aliquoted and stored at -80 °C. Soluble cell extracts (40 μl) were incubated with Orlistat (0–1 μm) for 20 min prior to FP-PEG-TAMRA addition. Lysates were labeled with FP-PEG-TAMRA, and reactions were terminated and processed as described above. The final concentration of Me2SO or ethanol in each reaction was 10%. Gene Silencing Using siRNA—FAS siRNA sequences corresponding to 5′-CAA CTA CGG CTT TGC CAA T (nucleotides 6213–6231), 5′-GCA ACT CAC GCT CCG GAA A (nucleotides 6657–6675), 5′-GCC CTG AGC TGG ACT ACT T (nucleotides 6146–6164), and 5′-GGT ATG CGA CGG GAA AGT A (nucleotides 7515–7533) were custom designed and pooled together by Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). MDA-MB-435 cells were plated at 3.125 × 104/cm2 in 6-cm plates for 24 h prior to transfection with 100 nm FAS, Skp2 (Dharmacon Smartpool M-003324–01) or scrambled control (Dharmacon D-001206–13) siRNA in Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen) using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were placed into normal culture medium 6 h post-transfection and grown for an additional 42 h. Fatty Acid Biosynthesis—The incorporation of [14C]malonyl CoA into cellular fatty acids was measured according to published methods (15Kuhajda F.P. Jenner K. Wood F.D. Hennigar R.A. Jacobs L.B. Dick J.D. Pasternack G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6379-6383Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Briefly, MDA-MB-435 cells were harvested with a cell scraper and centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 5 min and then frozen at -80 °C. Cell pellets were hypotonically lysed in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (14,000 rpm) for 15 min at 4 °C. Lysates (380 μg) were exposed to Orlistat (0.1–10 μm) or vehicle at 25 °C for 1 h. Lysates in 80-μl volumes were added to 520 μl of solution containing 581 μm NADPH, 193 μm acetyl CoA, and 116 mm KCl (pH 6.6). Reactions were mixed with 0.4 μCi [2-14C]malonyl CoA (Amersham Biosciences) for 25 min at 37 °C. Cold malonyl CoA (208 μm) was added to reaction mixtures, which were incubated for an additional 15 min at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of chloroform:methanol (1:1). The chloroform extracts were dried under N2 and extracted with water-saturated butanol. The butanol extract was evaporated under N2, and labeled fatty acids were quantified by scintillation counting. The identity of the labeled fatty acid was verified by comparison to a palmitate standard on thin layer chromatography. Briefly, lipid extracts from Orlistat and vehicle-treated lysates of MDA-MB-435 cells were resuspended in 40 μl of chloroform, spotted on silica gel (EM Science), and chromatographed in hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid (45:5:1). Tritiated palmitate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and cold palmitate (Sigma) were used as standards. Chromatographed lipids were detected by exposing the plate in iodine vapor and on Biomax film (Kodak). Cell Proliferation Assays—Cells were plated at 6.25 × 104/cm2 in 96-well plates for 24 h. Cells were washed with PBS and incubated in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium for 24 h prior to the addition of Orlistat (0–100 μm). Cell proliferation was measured 72 h later using the cell proliferation BrdU ELISA kit (Roche) according to the manufacturer's directions. Cell Synchronization and Cell-cycle Analysis—Tumor cells were plated at 6.25 × 104/cm2 in 6-well plates for 24 h, washed with PBS, and serum-starved for an additional 24 h. M phase synchronization was achieved by treating cells with 100 nm nocodazole (Sigma) for 16 h. Synchronized cells were treated with Orlistat (0–50 μm) immediately after release from the block and harvested at various times over 24 h. Cells were collected by trypsinization, rinsed in cold PBS, fixed in 70% ethanol, and stored at -20 °C. Cellular DNA was stained by the addition of PBS containing 200 units/ml of RNase (Roche) and 18 μg/ml of propidium iodide (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Fluorescence was monitored on 15,000 cells per sample using a BD FACSort tabletop cytometer (BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed with Modfit LT software (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME). Western Blot Analysis—Cells were synchronized with nocodazole, treated with Orlistat (0–50 μm), harvested by trypsinization, and rinsed with PBS. Pellets were lysed in 2× SDS sample buffer, passed 20 times through an 18-gauge needle, boiled for 5 min, and stored at -80 °C. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (14,000 rpm) for 10 min at 4 °C, and protein was separated by SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, protein was transferred onto nitrocellulose and probed overnight at 4 °C with anti-FAS (BD Transduction Laboratories, San Jose, CA), anti-p27 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-β-tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Rb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-phospho-Rb (Ser-780; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), anti-phospho-Rb (Ser-795; Cell Signaling Technology), anti-phospho-Rb (Ser-907/811; Cell Signaling Technology), and anti-p45 Skp2 (Zymed Laboratories, Inc., South San Francisco, CA). Immunoreactivity was detected by using anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG-conjugated peroxidase and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Serine Hydrolase Profile of Normal and Neoplastic Mammary Epithelial Cells—Activity-based protein profiling was used to visualize the profile of active serine hydrolases present in mammary carcinoma cells. We used an activity-based probe of serine hydrolases consisting of a fluorophosphonate moiety linked to tetramethyl rhodamine (FP-PEG-TAMRA). The fluorophosphonate warhead tags the active site serine of serine hydrolases, forming an adduct that is stable to SDS gel electrophoresis (29Patricelli M.P. Giang D.K. Stamp L.M. Burbaum J.J. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 1067-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Activity profiles of three human breast cancer cell lines, MCF7, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-435, were compared (Fig. 1). In each case, more than 20 active serine hydrolases were detected as fluorescent bands on the SDS gel. Pre-heating the sample to denature the enzymes in the lysate eliminated reaction with the FP-PEG-TAMRA probe. The identity of many of these enzymes was determined with mass spectrometry. They included, among others, dipeptidyl peptidases 7 and 9, prolyloligopeptidase, lysophospholipase-1, and FAS. Orlistat Suppresses Tumor Cell Proliferation by Interfering with G1/S Progression—Our previous work (24Kridel S.J. Axelrod F. Rozenkrantz N. Smith J.W. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 2070-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar) showed that Orlistat inhibits FAS in prostate carcinoma cells and that such inhibition slows their growth in vivo. Given the presence of FAS in mammary carcinoma cells (Fig. 1), we conducted studies to determine whether Orlistat would inhibit their proliferation. Studies were conducted to determine whether Orlistat interferes with the proliferation of mammary carcinoma cells. Cells were incubated with Orlistat for 72 h, and DNA synthesis was measured by incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine. Orlistat inhibited proliferation of the MCF7, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-435 cell lines (Fig. 2A). Slight differences were observed in the response of each cell line to Orlistat. Although proliferation of the MDA-MB-231 cells was completely inhibited by Orlistat, proliferation of the MDA-MB-435 cells was knocked down by 70–80%, and proliferation of the MCF7 cells was suppressed by ∼50%. To determine the effect of Orlistat on cell-cycle progression, we used synchronized cultures of MDA-MB-435 cells. Cells were synchronized in the M phase using a nocodazole block. After release of the block, cells were exposed to a saturating concentration of Orlistat and analyzed for the distribution of cells in the G1 and S phases every 4 h by flow cytometry. Orlistat dramatically slowed the entry of the cells into S phase compared with untreated cells (Fig. 2B). The amplitude of the G1 peak in Orlistat-treated cells declines slowly after a period of several hours. This decline in the G1 population results partially from apoptosis 2L. M. Knowles and J. W. Smith, unpublished observation. and also partially because the blockade is leaky. Similar results were obtained when cells were synchronized at the G1/S border using thymidine, released from the block, and allowed to progress through the next cell cycle (data not shown). Orlistat and Anti-FAS siRNA Block Fatty Acid Biosynthesis—We sought an independent means of inhibiting FAS to solidify the role of this enzyme in regulating tumor cell proliferation. Therefore, we compared Orlistat and siRNA-targeting FAS for the ability to knock down the activity of the enzyme in MDA-MB-435 mammary carcinoma cells (Fig. 3). As expected, Orlistat was without effect upon the level of FAS (Fig. 3A, left panel) but did ablate the activity of the thioesterase domain as indicated with the activity-based probe FP-PEG-TAMRA (Fig. 3A, right panel). The siRNA-targeting FAS reduced the level of FAS protein (Fig. 3B, left panel) and thereby reduced the labeling of the enzyme with the activity-based probe (Fig. 3B, right panel). Both antagonists also blocked the synthesis of palmitate, the end product of FAS, as indicated by reductions to the incorporation of [14C]malonyl CoA into fatty acids (Fig. 3, C and D). An FAS Blockade Alters the Key Regulatory Steps in the Retinoblastoma Protein Pathway—We examined the effects of a FAS blockade on key regulatory steps in the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) protein pathway, a primary regulator of the G1/S transition (30Brown V.D. Phillips R.A. Gallie B.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3246-3256Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This analysis included measures of (i) the phosphorylation status of Rb, a parameter that governs the interaction of this protein with E2F-1 and subsequent entry into S phase (30Brown V.D. Phillips R.A. Gallie B.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3246-3256Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar); (ii) p27Kip1, which negatively regulates cyclin-dependent kinase activity (31Loden M. Nielsen N.H. Roos G. Emdin S.O. Landberg G. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2557-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar); and (iii) Skp2, a protein component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase that regulates degradation of p27Kip1 (32Carrano A.C. Eytan E. Hershko A. Pagano M. Nat. Cell. Biol. 1999; 1: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). The effect of a concentration range of Orlistat on each of these parameters was measured by Western blotting (Fig. 4A). Orlistat reduced phosphorylation of the Rb protein, up-regulated p27Kip1, and down-regulated Skp2. These effects were evident at levels of the drug consistent with the cellular IC50 of Orlistat for inhibition of the FAS thioesterase (∼1–3 μm). To independently verify that the effects of Orlistat could be attributed to its ability to block FAS, similar experiments were conducted with siRNA-targeting FAS (Fig. 4B). Like Orlistat, the siRNA-targeting FAS decreased the phosphorylation of Rb, increased the level of p27Kip1, and reduced the level of Skp2. An siRNA-targeting Skp2 had identical effects upon its downstream target, p27Kip1, and upon the phosphorylation status of the Rb protein. Together, these findings provide strong support for the idea that a FAS blockade acts upon the Rb pathway via regulation of Skp2 and also indicate that a FAS blockade is likely to have effects similar to an Skp2 blockade. Results from this study reinforce the idea that FAS is a relevant drug target in oncology and further support the notion that FAS is the relevant target for Orlistat in tumor cells. The inhibitory effects of Orlistat on FAS are rather unexpected, because the drug has been studied for more than 15 years with no mention of the effects upon fatty acid synthesis. The effects of the drug on FAS are likely to have been overlooked because Orlistat is administered orally but is not significantly absorbed into the bloodstream. The drug acts in preventing absorption of dietary fat by inhibiting pancreatic lipase (another serine hydrolase) in the digestive tract (33Hadvary P. Sidler W. Meister W. Vetter W. Wolfer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2021-2027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Hauptman J.B. Jeunet F.S. Hartmann D. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1992; 55: 309S-313SCrossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The results of the present study indicate that Orlistat and other β-lactones should be considered to be a promising class of thioesterase antagonists that could be exploited for antitumor therapy. The evidence supporting the conclusion that the antiproliferative effects of Orlistat are mediated by inhibition of FAS is as follows: first, our activity-based protein-profiling experiments indicate that FAS is the only serine hydrolase target for Orlistat in the breast cancer cell lines. We have noted three other bands with Mr ∼ 90–150 kDa that are also inhibited by Orlistat, but these seem to be breakdown products of FAS because they can be immunoprecipitated with anti-FAS antibody and because they are knocked down with siRNA-targeting FAS (see Fig. 3B). Second, Orlistat blocks the incorporation of [14C]malonyl CoA into palmitate, a biosynthetic reaction mediated by FAS. Third, the effects of Orlistat on tumor cell proliferation and regulation of Rb, p27Kip1, and Skp2 all occur at concentrations of the drug that approximate its cellular IC50 for FAS (between 1 and 3 μm). Fourth, our prior work shows that Orlistat directly inhibits the activity of the recombinant thioesterase of FAS (24Kridel S.J. Axelrod F. Rozenkrantz N. Smith J.W. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 2070-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Fifth, the effects of Orlistat on tumor cell proliferation and on regulation of Rb and p27Kip1 are mimicked by siRNA-targeting FAS. The present study also provides a new insight into the mechanisms underlying the connection between FAS and tumor cell proliferation. Orlistat arrests the cell cycle at the G1/S transition. This effect was noted in all breast cancer cells we tested, along with tumor cells derived from the prostate (not shown). These findings suggest that the block in G1/S progression is a common mechanism mediating the antiproliferative effects of Orlistat. Substantial decreases in DNA synthesis have likewise been noted in response to cerulenin and c75, other antagonists of FAS (19Li J.N. Gorospe M. Chrest F.J. Kumaravel T.S. Evans M.K. Han W.F. Pizer E.S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1493-1499PubMed Google Scholar). The G1/S cell-cycle arrest elicited by a FAS blockade is mediated through the Rb pathway. Cells treated with either Orlistat or siRNA-targeting FAS show decreased phosphorylation of Rb and increased levels of the complex between Rb and E2F-1 (data not shown). The increased association of these two proteins prevents the transcriptional activity of E2F-1 essential for entry into S phase. We have traced the effects of a FAS blockade upstream of Rb and found such a blockade to alter the levels of p27Kip1 and Skp2. p27Kip1 acts as a negative regulator of the cyclin-dependent kinases that ultimately phosphorylate Rb and, therefore, p27Kip1 acts as a negative regulator of G1/S transition (35Rank K.B. Evans D.B. Sharma S.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 469-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Inhibition of FAS led to increases in p27Kip1 protein levels without affecting its transcription (data not shown), indicating a stabilization of p27Kip1. Interestingly, inhibition of FAS also substantially reduces the levels of Skp2, an F-box protein essential for proteasome degradation of p27Kip1. Like siRNA-targeting FAS, an siRNA-targeting Skp2 also increased p27Kip1 levels and blocked phosphorylation of Rb. Consequently, we conclude that inhibition of FAS acts upstream of the proteasome to control p27Kip1 levels and ultimately blocks cell-cycle progression. The mechanistic connections between the FAS blockade by Orlistat and reductions in Skp2 are the subject of current investigations. The observations in this report are different from prior work in which cerulenin and c75 were employed as FAS inhibitors. These compounds block both G1/S and G2/M progression (16Furuya Y. Akimoto S. Yasuda K. Ito H. Anticancer Res. 1997; 17: 4589-4593PubMed Google Scholar, 19Li J.N. Gorospe M. Chrest F.J. Kumaravel T.S. Evans M.K. Han W.F. Pizer E.S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1493-1499PubMed Google Scholar, 36Pizer E.S. Wood F.D. Pasternack G.R. Kuhajda F.P. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 745-751PubMed Google Scholar). We found no evidence that FAS blockade with Orlistat affected the G2/M transition point. There are two potential explanations for this difference in effect. One possibility is that inhibition of the different enzymatic pockets of FAS elicits distinct downstream effects. Although we cannot definitively exclude this possibility, it is difficult to envision how antagonists of distinct enzymatic pockets, each leading to inhibition of product formation, could elicit different effects. Another possibility is that cerulenin and c75 bind to additional molecular targets that account for the effects upon G2/M. In this regard, we have begun to analyze clonal variants of MDA-MB-435 cells resistant to Orlistat. We have found these cells to retain sensitivity to cerulenin (data not shown), a finding that lends support to the idea that these two compounds have different mechanisms of action. It is now clear that several avenues for antitumor therapy converge at the G1/S transition. Recent work indicates that Skp2 is one of the important G1/S regulatory points because it is necessary for ubiquitin-dependent degradation of p27Kip1 (32Carrano A.C. Eytan E. Hershko A. Pagano M. Nat. Cell. Biol. 1999; 1: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). Consequently, Skp2 is a positive regulator of cell-cycle progression. In fact, Skp2 has even been suggested as a potential drug target (37Schulman B.A. Carrano A.C. Jeffrey P.D. Bowen Z. Kinnucan E.R. Finnin M.S. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Pagano M. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 2000; 408: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), an idea that is significantly strengthened by the recent observation that Skp2 levels are associated with reduced survival in prostate cancer (38Yang G. Ayala G. Marzo A.D. Tian W. Frolov A. Wheeler T.M. Thompson T.C. Harper J.W. Clin. Cancer Res. 2002; 8: 3419-3426PubMed Google Scholar). The present study shows that a FAS blockade ultimately decreases Skp2 levels. Therefore, FAS represents an upstream leverage point for targeting Skp2. Identifying and understanding the mechanism and molecular players that make this connection is an important direction for future investigation."

We fused an amino-terminal yellow fluorescent protein fragment to β and a carboxyl-terminal yellow fluorescent protein fragment to γ. When expressed together, these two proteins produced a fluorescent signal in human embryonic kidney 293 cells that was not obtained with either subunit alone. Fluorescence was dependent on βγ assembly in that it was not obtained using β2 and γ1, which do not form a functional dimer. In addition to assembly, BiFC βγ complexes were functional as demonstrated by more specific plasma membrane labeling than was obtained with individually tagged fluorescent β and γ subunits and by their abilities to potentiate activation of adenylyl cyclase by αs in COS-7 cells. To investigate isoform-dependent targeting specificity, the localization patterns of dimers formed by pair-wise combinations of three different β subunits with three different γ subunits were compared. BiFC βγ complexes containing either β1 or β2 localized to the plasma membrane, whereas those containing β5 accumulated in the cytosol or on intracellular membranes. These results indicate that the β subunit can direct trafficking of the γ subunit. Taken together with previous observations, these results show that the G protein α, β, and γ subunits all play roles in targeting each other.

However, these differences generally do not appear to be great enough to account for the large effects seen with in vivo knockout models such as the γ7-deficient mouse (13Schwindinger W.F. Betz K.S.

In addition, studies of how G protein subunits are organized and localized in vivo suggest that cell type-specific expression and subcellular localization also play major roles in signaling specificity (19Robishaw J.D. Schwindinger W.F. Hansen C.A. Handbook of Cell Signaling. 2. Academic Press, Elsevier, 2003: 623-629Google Scholar). In support of this idea, rescue of αs and αq mutants with decreased affinities for βγ by co-expressed βγ dimers indicates differences in the abilities of particular βγ dimers to target these α subunits to the plasma membrane (20Evanko D.S. Thiyagarajan M.M. Siderovski D.P. Wedegaertner P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23945-23953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The G protein subunits are peripheral membrane proteins that associate with the plasma membrane as a result of fatty acid modifications and interaction with each other. Targeting of β subunits to the plasma membrane requires association with prenylated γ subunits (21Simonds W.F. Butrynski J.E. Gautam N. Unson C.G. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5363-5366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). α subunits attach to the plasma membrane as a result of amino-terminal palmitoylation and/or myristoylation and association with βγ subunits (22Wedegaertner P.B. Wilson P.T. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 503-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). A γ subunit that is mislocalized to the mitochondria can cause α and β to mislocalize (23Fishburn C.S. Pollitt S.K. Bourne H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1085-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Conversely, when αs is targeted to the mitochondria, β1γ2 follows (24Takida S. Wedegaertner P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17284-17290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). A role for the β subunit in targeting G proteins has not been reported. Here we apply the strategy of bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) 1The abbreviations used are: BiFC, bimolecular fluorescence complementation; GFP, green fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; mRFP, monomeric red fluorescent protein; HEK cells, human embryonic kidney cells; ECFP, enhanced CFP; RGS, regulator of G protein signaling. (25Hu C.D. Chinenov Y. Kerppola T.K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 789-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar) to visualize specific βγ dimers in vivo. BiFC involves the production of a fluorescent signal by two nonfluorescent fragments of YFP when they are brought together by interactions between proteins fused to each fragment. We fused an amino-terminal YFP fragment to β and a carboxyl-terminal YFP fragment to γ. When expressed together, these two proteins produce a fluorescent signal in HEK-293 cells that is not obtained with either subunit alone. This procedure enables visualization of βγ pairs that form complexes, producing no fluorescence for a βγ combination known to be unable to assemble. BiFC βγ complexes were functional, as demonstrated by more specific plasma membrane labeling than was obtained with individually tagged fluorescent β and γ subunits and by their abilities to modulate adenylyl cyclase activity. Comparisons of the localization patterns of βγ complexes formed by pairwise combinations of three different β subunits with three different γ subunits showed clear differences in localization patterns. This study also showed that the β subunit can direct βγ targeting in that complexes containing either β1 or β2 localized to the plasma membrane, whereas those containing β5 accumulated in the cytosol or on intracellular membranes. This method of specifically visualizing βγ dimers will have many applications in sorting out the roles of particular βγ complexes in a wide variety of cells and tissues. Production of Fluorescent Fusion Proteins—To produce YFP-(1–158)β1 in pcDNAI/Amp, YFP-(1–158) was amplified by a PCR from enhanced YFP (Clontech) that introduced a substitution of Met for Gln-69 (26Griesbeck O. Baird G.S. Campbell R.E. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29188-29194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). The PCR introduced a BamHI site at the 5′ end of YFP-(1–158) and a BglII site at the 3′ end. A BglII site was introduced into the polylinker of pcDNAI/Amp 3′ to the BamHI site, and YFP-(1–158) was subcloned into these sites to produce YFP-(1–158)pcDNAI/Amp. A BglII site in the human β1 cDNA 2J. Robishaw, unpublished information. was removed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and the cDNA was amplified by a PCR that added a linker sequence (Arg-Ser-Ile-Ala-Thr) containing a BamHI site on the 5′ end and a BglII site on the 3′ end. This PCR product was digested with BamHI and BglII and subcloned into the BglII site of YFP-(1–158)pcDNAI/Amp so that YFP-(1–158) was fused to the amino terminus of β1. To produce YFP-(1–158)β2 and YFP-(1–158)β5 in pcDNAI/Amp, the human β2 cDNA 2J. Robishaw, unpublished information. and the human β5 cDNA were each amplified by PCR, digested with BamHI and BglII, and subcloned into the BglII site of YFP-(1–158)pcDNAI/Amp as described for β1. A similar strategy was used to produce YFP-(159–238)γ7. YFP-(159–238) was amplified from enhanced YFP by a PCR that introduced a BamHI site at the 5′ end of YFP-(159–238) and a BglII site at the 3′ end and subcloned into the BamHI and BglII sites of the modified pcDNAI/Amp vector described above to produce YFP-(159–238)pcDNAI/Amp. The human γ7 cDNA (27Ray K. Kunsch C. Bonner L.M. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21765-21771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) was amplified by a PCR that added a BamHI site and a linker sequence (Arg-Ser) to the 5′ end and a BglII site to the 3′ end. This PCR product was digested with BamHI and BglII and subcloned into the BglII site of YFP-(159–238)pcDNAI/Amp so that YFP-(159–238) was fused to the amino terminus of γ7. To produce YFP-(159–238)γ1 and YFP-(159–238)γ2, the bovine γ1 cDNA 2J. Robishaw, unpublished information. and the human γ2 cDNA (27Ray K. Kunsch C. Bonner L.M. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21765-21771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) were each amplified by PCR, digested with BamHI and BglII, and subcloned into the BglII site of YFP-(159–238)pcDNAI/Amp as described for γ7. YFP-N-β and YFP-C-γ in the Dictyostelium expression vector pCV5 were produced as follows. For YFP-N-β, PCR of YFP-(1–158) introduced a BamHI site followed by a Dictyostelium ribosomal binding site at the 5′ end and a BglII site at the 3′ end. The Dictyostelium β-coding sequence was amplified with introduction of a BamHI site and a linker sequence (Ile-Ala-Thr) at the 5′ end and a BglII site at 3′ end. The two PCR fragments were sequentially subcloned into the BglII site in pCV5. For YFP-C-γ, a BamHI site and the codons for Met-Ser were introduced before YFP-(159–238), and the YFP stop codon was eliminated and substituted with a BglII site. The Dictyostelium γ subunit-coding sequence was flanked by a BamHI site on the 5′ end and a BglII site on the 3′ end. These two fragments were sequentially subcloned into pCV5. To produce GFP-β1, the human β1 cDNA was amplified by PCR and ligated into pWay5, a derivative of pCR3.1 (Invitrogen), in the presence of Srf I, as described (28Lo W. Rodgers W. Hughes T. Biotechniques. 1998; 25 (98): 94-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This procedure added a linker sequence (Gly-Gly-Gly-Pro-Ser-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser) in between the amino-terminal GFP and the carboxyl-terminal β1 sequences. To produce CFP-γ2 and CFP-γ7, the GFP sequence in pWAY5 was replaced with that of ECFP (Clontech) containing a substitution of His for Asn-164 (29Miyawaki A. Griesbeck O. Heim R. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2135-2140Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar), and the γ2 and γ7 sequences were each amplified by PCR and subcloned into this vector in the presence of Srf I. The resulting constructs contained a linker sequence (Gly-Gly-Gly-Pro-Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Asp-Val-Pro-Asp-Tyr-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly-Gly-Pro-Gly-Ile-Leu-Arg) that includes the hemagglutinin epitope in between the ECFP and γ sequences, similar to that described in Manahan et al. (30Manahan C.L. Patnana M. Blumer K.J. Linder M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 957-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Transient Expression and Assay for cAMP Accumulation—0.8 × 106 COS-7 cells (obtained from Henry Bourne) in 60-mm dishes were transfected with plasmids as described in the legends to Figs. 3 and 4 using 10 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 24 h after transfection, the cells were replated in 24-well plates and labeled with [3H]adenine. After an additional 24 h, intracellular cAMP levels were determined as described previously (31Medina R. Grishina G. Meloni E.G. Muth T.R. Berlot C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24720-24727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). cAMP accumulation was measured in the presence of 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor.Fig. 4Comparison of YFP-N-β·YFP-C-γ dimers with those produced using GFP-β and CFP-γ. A–H, YFP-N-β·YFP-C-γ dimers produce more specific labeling of the plasma membrane than GFP-β·CFP-γ dimers. HEK-293 cells expressing the following constructs were imaged. A, YFP-N-β1·YFP-C-γ2.

I, GFP-β·γ and β·CFP-γ, but not GFP-β·CFP-γ, dimers potentiate activation of adenylyl cyclase in COS-7 cells. cAMP accumulation was measured in COS-7 cells transfected with a total of 2.025 μg of plasmid consisting of vector alone (pcDNAI/Amp) or varying amounts of vector plus 0.025 μg of plasmid encoding αsR201C and 1 μg each of plasmids encoding the indicated β and γ subunits.

For studies of GFP-β1, CFP-γ2, and CFP-γ7, cells were transfected with 0.075 μg each of fluorescent and/or untagged G protein subunits, as described in the legend to Fig. 4. The cells were imaged 2 days after transfection at 63× using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 fluorescence microscope equipped with computer-controlled filter wheels, shutters, xyz stage (Ludl), and an ORCA-ER camera (Hamamatsu) under the control of IPLab software (Scanalytics). A single triple pass dichroic mirror (86006bs, Chroma) was used to ensure image registration. Excitation and emission filters for CFP (430/25, 465/30), YFP (495/20, 535/25), and mRFP1 (565/25, 630/60) were obtained from Chroma (Brattelboro, VT). One hour before imaging the culture medium was replaced with 20 mm HEPES-buffered minimal essential medium with Earle's salts without bicarbonate. During imaging the cells were maintained at 37 °C using a CSMI stage incubator (Harvard Apparatus). For each YFP-N-β·YFP-C-γ and GFP-β1·CFP-γ combination, 40–70 cells were imaged from plates transfected on 3 different days. Measurement of Intensity and Membrane Targeting of YFP-N-β·YFP-C-γ Complexes—The membrane marker (ECFP-Mem) was used as the primary criterion for selecting cells for imaging and analysis. Cells having a clear plasma membrane border and adjacent region of cytoplasm were identified. If the cell also had detectable intensity of the cytoplasm marker (mRFP) and YFP-N-β·YFP-C-γ, then the cell image was recorded. Exposure times and gain for each image varied depending on cell intensity, and the following corrections were made so that the intensity values correspond to a 1-s exposure, gain of 1, with instrument background subtracted. Instrument background as a function of exposure time and gain was determined from images of dishes containing media without cells. The instrument background was subtracted from each image, and the remaining intensity was scaled to correspond to an exposure time of 1 s and a gain of 1. Fluorescence intensity was determined empirically to be related linearly to exposure time and gain. A small amount of bleed-through of CFP intensity into the YFP images (0.6%) was then subtracted. All image processing was performed using IPlab software. The average fluorescence intensity of each YFP-N-β·YFP-C-γ combination was determined by tracing the border of each cell using the ECFP-Mem image and calculating the average pixel intensity of the entire cell including the border for the YFP-N-β·YFP-C-γ image. The average intensity of YFP-C-γ7, which does not contain the chromophore, expressed alone (7.5, S.E. = 0.16, n = 18) was used to determine the intensity due to autofluorescence. Images with average intensity values below 7.5 were not included in the calculation of average intensity or of plasma membrane fraction, described in the next paragraph. The plasma membrane fraction of the YFP-N-β·YFP-C-γ complexes in each cell was determined as follows (see Fig. 6, C–F). Plasma membrane pixels corresponding to a length of plasma membrane were identified and marked using the ECFP-Mem image. Cytoplasm pixels were marked with a 12 × 12-pixel box adjacent to the plasma membrane pixels in a region that was devoid of intracellular membranes, which were not quantified. The plasma membrane to cytoplasm ratios of YFP-N-β·YFP-C-γ (βγR), plasma membrane marker (PMR), and cytoplasm marker (CR) were calculated by dividing the average intensity of each label in the marked plasma membrane region by the average intensity in the marked cytoplasm region. PMR and CR were very consistent, with mean values of 1.24 (S.D. = 0.15, n = 375) and 0.66 (S.D. = 0.099, n = 375), respectively. The plasma membrane fraction of YFP-N-β·YFP-C-γ, PMF(βγ), is defined as the plasma membrane to cytoplasm ratio of YFP-N-β·YFP-C-γ relative to that of the plasma membrane and cytoplasm markers in the same cell and was calculated using the following equation.PMF(βγ)=(βγR−CR)/(PMR−CR).(Eq. 1) A value of zero corresponds to a completely cytoplasmic distribution, and a value of one corresponds to a completely plasma membrane distribution. Development of a Method to Visualize Functional Fluorescent βγ Dimers—We have applied the strategy of BiFC (25Hu C.D. Chinenov Y. Kerppola T.K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 789-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar) to visualize βγ dimers. This approach involves the production of a fluorescent signal by two nonfluorescent fragments of YFP when they are brought together by interactions between proteins fused to each fragment. The G protein β and γ subunits appeared to be ideal candidates for this technique because they associate irreversibly into a complex that functions as a single unit and the amino termini of the two subunits are associated into a coiled-coil (34Sondek J. Bohm A. Lambright D.G. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). To produce fluorescent βγ dimers we fused an amino-terminal YFP fragment (residues 1–158, referred to as YFP-N) to the amino terminus of the β subunit to produce YFP-N-β and a carboxyl-terminal YFP fragment (residues 159–238, referred to as YFP-C) to the amino terminus of the γ subunit to produce YFP-C-γ (Fig. 1). As an initial test of this approach, one of us (L. T.) produced YFP-N-β and YFP-C-γ constructs derived from the single β and single γ subunits that are encoded in the genome of the cellular slime mold, Dictyostelium discoideum. Expressing both of these YFP-N-β and YFP-C-γ constructs resulted in a fluorescence signal that was enriched on the plasma membrane (Fig. 2 and Supplemental Video 1), whereas expressing either recombinant protein alone did not produce a detectable fluorescent signal (data not shown). This result demonstrates that BiFC can be used to image βγ dimers and led us to investigate whether this approach could distinguish among the numerous potential βγ dimers formed in mammals in terms of their efficiency of formation and their subcellular localization patterns.Fig. 2Imaging of YFP-N-β·YFP-C-γ in D. discoideum. Wild-type D. discoideum Ax-3 cells were transformed by electroporation with YFP-N-β and YFP-C-γ, and transformants were selected using 20 μg/ml G418 in HL-5 media. A, distribution of YFP-N-β·YFP-C-γ in vegetative (growth phase) cells. B, distribution of YFP-N-β·YFP-C-γ in polarized chemotaxing cells. D. discoideum lives as a single cell organism when the environment is favorable, whereas adverse conditions such as starvation trigger aggregation of cells to form multicellular structures. During aggregation, chemotaxis of amoebae to cAMP secreted by other cells is mediated by a G protein-coupled receptor. In these chemotaxing cells YFP-N-β·YFP-C-γ complexes were also distributed uniformly around the plasma membrane. Bar = 5 μm. A video is available as supplemental material (Video 1). In this video, Ax-3 cells expressing YFP-N-β·YFP-C-γ were starved for 5 h before being exposed to a chemoattractant gradient produced with a micropipet filled with cAMP. The circle indicates the location of the micropipet tip.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To test the ability of the BiFC approach to produce functional fluorescent βγ dimers, we examined the properties of YFP-N-β1·YFP-C-γ2 and YFP-N-β1·YFP-C-γ7 complexes. β1γ2 has been used extensively in studies of interactions between βγ and effectors such as adenylyl cyclase (2Iniguez-Lluhi J.A.

Logothetis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7348-7355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Ribozyme inactivation studies have shown that β1γ7 mediates signaling from the β2-adrenergic receptor to adenylyl cyclase via Gs in HEK-293 cells (11Wang Q. Mullah B.K. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol.

YFP-N-β1·YFP-C-γ2 (Fig. 3A) and YFP-N-β1·YFP-C-γ7 (Fig. 3B) exhibited strong signals in the plasma membrane. However, when expressed by themselves, YFP-N-β1 (Fig. 3D) and YFP-C-γ7 (Fig. 3E) were not fluorescent. In addition, co-expression of YFP-N and YFP-C did not produce a specific fluorescent signal (Fig. 3F). Specific fluorescence was not obtained upon co-expression of YFP-N-β2 and YFP-C-γ1 (Figs. 3C, 5D, and 6A), confirming previous studies indicating that β2 and γ1 do not interact to form a functional dimer (2Iniguez-Lluhi J.A.

These results indicate that the BiFC method only produces specific fluorescence when YFP-N and YFP-C are fused to β and γ subunits that interact. Functionality of BiFC βγ complexes was tested for by determining their abilities to modulate adenylyl cyclase activity. The adenylyl cyclase activity in COS-7 cells is stimulated by βγ in the presence of activated αs (37Federman A.D. Conklin B.R. Schrader K.A. Reed R.R. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1992; 356: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). cAMP accumulation was measured in COS-7 cells that co-expressed αsR201C, a constitutively activated αs mutant (38Landis C.A. Masters S.B. Spada A. Pace A.M. Bourne H.R. Vallar L. Nature. 1989; 340: 692-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar), and fluorescent or unlabeled βγ complexes. YFP-N-β1·YFP-C-γ2 potentiated adenylyl cyclase activation with a somewhat lower efficacy than did β1γ2, whereas individually expressed β and γ subunits did not potentiate activation of adenylyl cyclase (Fig. 3G). Comparisons of expression levels in immunoblots of membranes of COS-7 cells transfected with either β1γ2 or YFP-N-β1·YFP-C-γ2 showed that attachment of YFP-C to γ2 had only minor effects on expression, but attachment of YFP-N to β1 resulted in a decreased level"

Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2087) Google Scholar). The so-called store-operated Ca2+-permeable channels (SOCs) that mediate this Ca2+ influx are present in the PM of most nonexcitable cells and several types of excitable cells (2Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1997; 21: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 3Putney Jr., J.W. Bird G.S.

Cell Calcium. 2003; 34: 339-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To date, the best-studied SOCs in terms of biophysical properties and modes of regulation are calcium release-activated Ca2+ channels (CRACs) originally described in immune cells (8Lewis R.S. Cahalan M.D. Cell Regul. 1989; 1: 99-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 9Hoth M. Penner R. Nature. 1992; 355: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (1479) Google Scholar, 10Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6295-6299Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). However, the plethora number of studies conducted in various cell models over recent years has clearly established the existence of numerous SOC subtypes with the properties distinct from “classic” CRAC (11Gusev K. Glouchankova L. Zubov A. Kaznacheyeva E. Wang Z. Bezprozvanny I. Mozhayeva N. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 122: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These subtypes are differentiated by their selectivity, unitary conductance, pharmacology, and modes of regulation (reviewed in Ref. 12Putney Jr., J.W. McKay R.R. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Despite an obvious progress achieved in SOC understanding, the one or more precise mechanisms linking store depletion to SOC activation still remain a matter of debate. Three major model hypotheses for SOC activation are currently considered.The first model implies dynamic conformational coupling involving direct protein-protein interaction between the ER membrane proteins responsible for physiological Ca2+ liberation such as IP3 and ryanodine receptors (4Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar, 13Irvine R.F. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 14Kiselyov K. Xu X. Mozhayeva G. Kuo T.

A. 2001; 98: 11777-11782Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and plasma membrane SOCs, which results in SOC activation. This model received considerable experimental support over the recent years. Moreover, the latest data suggest that the conformational coupling mechanism of SOC activation may not even require store depletion, because IP3 receptor (IP3R) mutant devoid of Ca2+-releasing capability is still able to support agonist-induced Ca2+ entry (18Van Rossum D.B. Patterson R.L. Kiselyov K. Boehning D. Barrow R.K. Gill D.L. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2323-2327Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).The second model postulates the existence of a diffusible messenger termed “calcium influx factor” (CIF), which can be formed and released from the ER upon depletion, thereby transmitting the signal to plasma membrane SOCs (19Randriamampita C. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1993; 364: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar, 20Parekh A.B. Terlau H. Stuhmer W. Nature. 1993; 364: 814-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The nature and molecular origin of CIF as well as the precise role it plays in physiological Ca2+ signaling pathways is as yet unknown. However, the following recent developments in the field make the “CIF hypothesis” very attractive: 1) obtaining the evidence on diffusible messenger involvement in smooth muscle SOC activation (21Trepakova E.S. Csutora P. Hunton D.L. Marchase R.B. Cohen R.A. Bolotina V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26158-26163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), 2) establishment of a causal link between store depletion and activation of Ca2+-independent phospholipase A2 (iPLA2) (22Wolf M.J. Wang J. Turk J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1522-1526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), 3) demonstration of the role of iPLA2 in membrane-delimited SOC activation (23Smani T. Zakharov S.I.

Trepakova E.S. Bolotina V.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), and, finally, 4) CIF implication in store-dependent iPLA2 stimulation (24Smani T. Zakharov S.I. Csutora P. Leno E. Trepakova E.S. Bolotina V.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar).Finally, the third “secretion-like” coupling model suggests that the docking or fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane may activate CCE probably via exocytosis of membrane channels or regulatory molecules (25Yao Y. Ferrer-Montiel A.V. Montal M. Tsien R.Y. Cell. 1999; 98: 475-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). There is evidence that a secretion-like mechanism might involve cytoskeletal modifications permitting close, but reversible interactions between the ER and the PM upon store depletion (26Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Gill D.L. Cell. 1999; 98: 487-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 27Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), although such a possibility does not always find experimental support (28Bakowski D. Burgoyne R.D. Parekh A.B. J. Physiol. 2003; 553: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).The ER Ca2+ stores can be depleted actively via ultimate stimulation of IP3Rs or passively due to enhanced Ca2+ leak from the ER. The first type of depletion can be achieved by such physiological means as stimulation of membrane receptors coupled to phospholipase C (PLC)-catalyzed IP3 production or use of exogenous IP3, whereas the second type can be modeled with pharmacological agents permitting artificial shifting the balance toward Ca2+ leakage due to suppression of ER Ca2+ uptake (SERCA pump inhibitor thapsigargin (TG)), formation of additional leakage pathways (Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin (IM)), or excessive cytosolic Ca2+ buffering (Ca2+ chelators). From general considerations it is hard to imagine that store-depleting interventions, working through enhanced ER leak, would activate SOCs via the mechanism involving direct conformational IP3R-SOC interaction. At the same time one can expect that by using receptor agonists or IP3 per se, it would theoretically be possible to recruit all mechanisms existing in the cell for SOC activation. Thus, employment of various experimental protocols to affect the filling status of ER Ca2+ stores can be useful instrument for dissecting overall SOCE on individual components based on their activation mechanisms.Two pieces of evidence, 1) the possibility of rescuing agonist-induced Ca2+ entry in IP3R knockout cells by overexpression of IP3R mutant defective of Ca2+-releasing property (18Van Rossum D.B. Patterson R.L. Kiselyov K. Boehning D. Barrow R.K. Gill D.L. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2323-2327Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and 2) the retention of TG-induced SOCE in IP3R knockout cells (29Venkatachalam K. Ma H.T. Ford D.L. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33980-33985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 30Sugawara H. Kurosaki M. Takata M. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3078-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), strongly suggest not only the presence of two, “strictly IP3R-dependent” and “generally store-dependent” modes of SOC activation, but also their possible co-existence in the single cell type. In fact, such co-existence has already been demonstrated (11Gusev K. Glouchankova L. Zubov A. Kaznacheyeva E. Wang Z. Bezprozvanny I. Mozhayeva N. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 122: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), although without providing any clues as to possible differences, either in coupling mechanisms or in molecular origin of respective SOCs. At the same time it is likely that both may be cell-specific requiring thorough identification in each particular case. The preferential mode of SOC activation may also depend on the degree of ER compartmentalization due to the existence of specialized ER sub-regions involved in different SOC-controlling signaling pathways (31Huang Y. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19554-19559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 32Gregory R.B. Wilcox R.A.

By comparing amplitude and kinetic characteristics, susceptibility to regulatory influences and to various TRPs knockout of store-operated currents (ISOC) activated by IP3 and TG, we came to the conclusion that two functionally distinct SOC populations exist. The first one (called SOCCC for “conformational coupling”) is characterized by a preferential IP3R-mediated mode of activation and the dominant contribution of TRPC1 within it. The second one (called SOCCIF for “calcium influx factor”) depends on iPLA2 for activation with probable CIF involvement and is mostly represented by TRPC4. The previously identified SOC constituent, TRPV6 (36Vanden Abeele F. Roudbaraki M. Shuba Y. Skryma R. Prevarskaya N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15381-15389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 37Vanden Abeele F. Shuba Y. Roudbaraki M. Lemonnier L. Vanoverberghe K. Mariot P. Skryma R. Prevarskaya N. Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 357-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), seems to play an equal role in both types of SOC. These results provide new insight into the nature of SOCs and their representation in the single cell type and permit reconciliation of current SOC activation hypotheses.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Cultures—LNCaP cells from the American Type Culture Collection were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (BioWhittaker, Fontenay sous Bois, France) supplemented with 5 mm l-glutamine (Sigma) and 10% fetal bovine serum (Seromed, Poly-Labo, Strasbourg, France). The culture medium also contained 50,000 IU/liter penicillin and 50 mg/liter streptomycin. Cells were routinely grown in 50-ml flasks (Nunc, PolyLabo) and kept at 37 °C in a humidified incubator in an air/CO2 (95/5%) atmosphere. For electrophysiological experiments, the cells were subcultured in Petri dishes (Nunc) coated with polyornithine (Sigma, 5 mg/liter) and used after 3–6 days.Electrophysiology and Solutions—Macroscopic currents in LNCaP cells were recorded in the whole cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique using a computer-controlled EPC-9 amplifier (HEKA Electronic, Germany). Patch pipettes were made from borosilicate glass capillaries (World Precision Instruments) on a PIP-5 (HEKA Electronic) puller. The resistance of the pipettes filled with the basic pipette solution (see below) varied from 4 to 6 MΩ.The high Ca2+ extracellular solution used for store-operated Ca2+ current recordings contained (in millimolar): NaCl, 120; tetraethylammonium-Cl, 20; CaCl2, 10; MgCl2, 1; glucose, 5; HEPES, 10; pH, 7.3 (adjusted with triethanolamine (OH)). The basic Cs+-based, Ca2+-free pipette (intracellular) solution included (in millimolar): cesium methane sulfonate, 145; MgCl2, 1; HEPES, 10; BAPTA, 10; pH, 7.3 (adjusted with Cs(OH)). Necessary supplements (IP3 and thapsigargin) were added directly to the respective solutions, from appropriately prepared stock solutions.During electrophysiological experiments, cells were kept in the regular extracellular solution. External solutions were changed, using a multibarrel puffing micropipette, with a common outflow positioned in close proximity to the cell under investigation. During the experiment, the cell was continuously superfused with the solution via puffing pipette to reduce possible artifacts related to the change from static to moving solution and vice versa. Complete external solution exchange was achieved in <1 s.Analysis of membrane currents was performed offline. Usually three to five current traces that directly preceded the store-depleting operation were averaged to derive a mean base-line current, which was then subtracted from the currents during the operation. The resultant current was considered to be a store-operated one (ISOC).Antisense Assays—The LNCaP cells were treated for up to 5 days with either 0.5 μm phosphorothioate antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) (Eurogentec) targeted to the iPLA2 coding region and 2.5 μm cytofectin (GS3815 to dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine at a 2:1 molar ration, unsized) (Eurogentec) or sense ODNs by adding them directly to the culture medium. The 18-mer ODNs used in these studies had the following sequences: 5′-CTCCTTCACCCGGAATGGGT-3′ for antisense ODN and 5′-ACCCATTCCGGGTGAAGGAG-3′ for sense ODN. The sequences of sense and antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) (Eurogentec) targeted to the coding regions of TRPC3 and TRPC4 were: 5′-CCATGGACCTAGAGAAGC-3′ for TRPC3 antisense ODN and 5′-CCATGGACCTAGAGAAGC-3′ for TRPC3 sense ODN; 5′-GTAATAGAACTGAGCCAT-3′ for TRPC4 antisense ODN and 5′-ATGGCTCAGTTCTATTAC-3′ for TRPC4 sense ODN.Fluorescence Measurements of [Ca2+]ER—LNCaP cells were grown on glass coverslips and loaded with 2 μm of the AM-ester derivative of Mag-fura 2 for 45 min at 37 °C (the detailed procedure has been described previously (35Vanden Abeele F. Skryma R. Shuba Y. Van Coppenolle F. Slomianny C. Roudbaraki M. Mauroy B. Wuytack F. Prevarskaya N. Cancer Cell. 2002; 1: 169-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar)). After incubation with dye, the plasma membrane was then selectively permeabilized: cells were rinsed briefly in a high K+ solution (in millimolar): 125 KCl, 25 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 0.1 MgCl2, pH 7.2 then exposed for 2 min to an “intracellular buffer” at 37 °C and 5 μg/ml digitonin. Permeabilized cells were continuously superfused with an intracellular buffer (the same solution without digitonin and supplemented with 0.2 mm Mg-ATP, with free Ca2+ concentration clamped to 170 nm using Ca2+/EGTA buffers). Ratio imaging measurements of Mag-fura 2 fluorescence were made using a commercial imaging system (Quanticell 900, Applied Imaging, UK).Western Blot Analysis—Microsomal preparations of LNCaP cells and of control RBL-2H3 cells were prepared and analyzed by Western blotting analysis for TRP and IP3R expression as previously described (35Vanden Abeele F. Skryma R. Shuba Y. Van Coppenolle F. Slomianny C. Roudbaraki M. Mauroy B. Wuytack F. Prevarskaya N.

Antibodies anti-calnexin and against TRPC (TRPC1, TRPC3, and TRPC4) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. and Alomone, respectively. The antibodies used for IP3R detection were the isoform-specific polyclonal antibodies against IP3R1 (Rbt03) or against IP3R2 (Rbt02 and Rbt226) (40Parys J.B. de Smedt H. Missiaen L.

Additionally, we used affinity-purified Rbt475 to simultaneously detect the various IP3R isoforms (39Vanoverberghe K. Mariot P. Vanden Abeele F. Delcourt P. Parys J.B. Prevarskaya N. Cell Calcium. 2003; 34: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The various IP3R isoforms were quantified by fluoroimaging (38Vanlingen S. Parys J.B. Missiaen L. De Smedt H. Wuytack F. Casteels R. Cell Calcium. 1997; 22: 475-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Determination of the IP3R isoform levels was performed by using two independent quantification approaches, as previously described (39Vanoverberghe K. Mariot P. Vanden Abeele F. Delcourt P. Parys J.B. Prevarskaya N. Cell Calcium. 2003; 34: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar); i.e. either indirectly by comparison with the IP3R levels observed in RBL-2H3 microsomes or directly by comparison of the signals obtained for the different molecular weight bands with affinity-purified Rbt475.Data Analysis and Statistics—Each experiment was repeated several times. The data were analyzed using PulseFit (HEKA Electronics) and Origin 5.0 (Microcal, Northampton, MA) software. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E., where appropriate. Student's t test was used for statistical comparison of the differences, and p < 0.05 was considered significant.Chemicals—All chemicals were from Sigma except for thapsigargin, which was purchased from Calbiochem, and Mag-fura 2-AM was from Molecular Probes.RESULTSTo dissect the overall SOCE in LNCaP cells onto components characterized by different modes of store-dependent activation and presumably relying on separate trans-membrane Ca2+ entry pathways we: 1) compared store-operated Ca2+ currents (ISOC) activated by IP3 and TG, 2) correlated the magnitudes and temporal parameters of the development of these currents to the extent and speed of IP3- and TG-induced stores depletion, 3) examined the regulation of these currents by different intracellular factors, and 4) assessed their sensitivity to the knockout of TRP members with potential store dependence expressed in LNCaP cells.Relationship between the Extent of Ca2+ Store Depletion and Activation of ISOC—In complete agreement with our previous studies (35Vanden Abeele F. Skryma R. Shuba Y. Van Coppenolle F. Slomianny C. Roudbaraki M. Mauroy B. Wuytack F. Prevarskaya N. Cancer Cell. 2002; 1: 169-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 36Vanden Abeele F. Roudbaraki M. Shuba Y. Skryma R. Prevarskaya N. J. Biol.

Prevarskaya N. Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 357-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), inclusion of 100 μm IP3 in the intracellular pipette solution used for the whole cell patch-clamp current recording resulted in the development of inwardly rectifying Ca2+-carried membrane current, which we identified as being store-operated due to IP3-mediated store depletion (ISOC,IP3). With 10 mm Ca2+ in the bath, this current developed to a maximal density of 2.3 ± 0.3 pA/picofarad (at –100 mV, n = 9) in about 50 s following the establishment of the whole cell configuration (Fig. 1, A and B) and then stayed relatively constant or even slightly declined over a period of up to 5 min. It should be noted that 100 μm intracellular IP3 was already at a saturating concentration for the current activation, and its further increase did not result in the enhancement of ISOC,IP3 density (data not shown).Similar current in terms of rectification and [Ca2+]out dependence could be activated by TG-mediated store depletion in response to extracellular application of TG (0.1 μm). However, the time course of TG-induced store-operated current (ISOC,TG) was much slower (i.e. time to plateau ∼ 300 s), whereas the maximal density at –100 mV was considerably lower (i.e. 0.7 ± 0.3 pA/picofarad, n = 10) compared with IP3-induced one (Fig. 1, A and B).In response to equimolar substitutions of Sr2+, Ba2+, or Mn2+ for Ca2+ the ISOC,IP3 amplitudes measured at –100 mV changed in the following order (relative to that of Ca2+, n = 6): Ca2+ (1Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2087) Google Scholar) > Sr2+ (0.69) = Ba2+ (0.65) » Mn2+ (0.23). Similar measurements for ISOC,TG (n = 6) provided somewhat different values: Ca2+ (1Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2087) Google Scholar) > Sr2+ (0.67) > Ba2+ (0.58) » Mn2+ (0.07) with significant difference (p < 0.05) observed only for Mn2+ and an insignificant difference for Ba2+.A strong divergence in ISOC,IP3 and ISOC,TG temporal parameters of development and maximal density may be explained by different rates of IP3- and TG-induced store depletion and maximal achievable levels of depletion. To check for this possibility we directly assessed the ER Ca2+ store depletion under the action of IP3 and TG using compartmentalized fluorescent Ca2+ indicator Mag-fura 2-AM on digitonin-permeabilized LN-CaP cells. This technology has been already successfully used for monitoring changes in free Ca2+ within the ER lumen ([Ca2+]ER) in our previous study (35Vanden Abeele F. Skryma R. Shuba Y. Van Coppenolle F. Slomianny C. Roudbaraki M. Mauroy B. Wuytack F. Prevarskaya N. Cancer Cell. 2002; 1: 169-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Fig. 1C shows the time course of a typical experiment on ratiometric measurements of [Ca2+]ER in LNCaP cells in response to IP3 (100 μm) and TG (0.1 μm) applications. As one can see, if IP3 produced a rapid, but relatively small drop in [Ca2+]ER, then TG caused a slowly developing, but large reduction of [Ca2+]ER, which could be only slightly further augmented by a saturating concentration of IM (1 μm). Quantification of the maximal extent of IP3- and TG-mediated ER store depletions in the assumption that IM produces total liberation of available Ca2+ provided the fractions of store content reduction of 29 ± 8% (n = 20) and 79 ± 8% (n = 25), respectively (Fig. 1D).Thus, comparison of IP3 and TG store-depleting capabilities with respective current magnitudes shows a lack of direct correlation between the two. IP3, which depletes only a small fraction of the store, is capable of activating a large membrane current, whereas TG, although producing almost complete store depletion, induces a disproportionably small current. Altogether, these results suggest the role of other factors than just store content in current activation and may be indicative of specifics in store-to-SOC signaling as well as diversity of targeted SOCs. The next series of experiments was undertaken to verify these possibilities.IP3- and TG-activated Store-dependent Currents Are Additive—To answer the question as to whether or not IP3- and TG-mediated current activations utilize different store-to-channel signaling pathways and/or are based on different membrane channels, the first thing to do is to check if ISOC,IP3 and ISOC,TG are additive. Indeed, if either preferential store-channel coupling mode or targeted channel is common then in the event of saturating influences one would not expect to see simultaneous activation of both currents.Fig. 2 (A and B) shows that application of increasing TG concentrations (in the range of 0.01 to 1 μm), although invoking progressively larger Ca2+ releases from the store (measured in nominally Ca2+-free extracellular saline), produces only acceleration of ISOC,TG activation, but not the enhancement of its density. This result suggests that either only a small part of the total TG-releasable pool is functionally coupled to membrane"
https://openalex.org/W2157659024,"The ATP-sensitive potassium channel from the inner mitochondrial membrane (mitoKATP) is a highly selective conductor of K+ ions. When isolated in the presence of nonionic detergent and reconstituted in liposomes, mitoKATP is inhibited with high affinity by ATP (K½ = 20–30 μm). We have suggested that holo-mitoKATP is a heteromultimer consisting of an inwardly rectifying K+ channel (mitoKIR) and a sulfonylurea receptor (Grover, G. J., and Garlid, K. D. (2000) J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 32, 677–695). Here, we show that a 55-kDa protein isolated by ethanol extraction and reconstituted in bilayer lipid membranes and liposomes is the mitoKIR. This protein, which lacks the sulfonylurea receptor subunit, is inhibited with low affinity by ATP, with K1/2 ∼ 550 μm. ATP inhibition of both mitoKIR and holo-mitoKATP is reversed by UDP (K½1/2 = 10–15 μm). Holo-mitoKATP is and diazoxide, and the opened by cromakalim flux through the open channel is inhibited by glibenclamide and 5-hydroxydecanoate. None of these agents has any effect upon mitoKIR. We have identified two compounds that act specifically on mitoKIR. p-diethylaminoethylbenzoate reverses inhibition of mitoKIR by ATP and ADP at micromolar concentrations and also opens mitoKATP in isolated mitochondria. Tetraphenylphosphonium inhibits K+ flux through both mitoKIR and mitoKATP with the same apparent affinity.

The importance of the mitochondrial K+ cycle for volume regulation, reviewed by Garlid and Paucek (1Garlid K.D. Paucek P. IUBMB Life. 2001; 52: 153-158Google Scholar) was recognized by Mitchell (2Mitchell P. Biol. Rev. Camb. Philos. Soc. 1966; 41: 445-502Google Scholar) long before any of the components of this cycle were discovered. K+ is driven into the matrix by the high membrane potential (Δψ) 1The abbreviations used are: Δψ, membrane potential; mitoKATP, mitochondrial KATP channel; mitoKIR, inward-rectifying channel subunit of mitoKATP; mitoSUR, sulfonylurea receptor subunit of mitoKATP; cellKATP, ATP-dependent K+ channel; DEB, p-diethylaminoethylbenzoate; TPP, tetraphenylphosphonium; PBFI, potassium-binding benzofuran isophthalate; 5-HD, 5-hydroxydecanoic acid; holo-mitoKATP, mitoKATP containing both of its subunits; NH, Hill coefficient. 1The abbreviations used are: Δψ, membrane potential; mitoKATP, mitochondrial KATP channel; mitoKIR, inward-rectifying channel subunit of mitoKATP; mitoSUR, sulfonylurea receptor subunit of mitoKATP; cellKATP, ATP-dependent K+ channel; DEB, p-diethylaminoethylbenzoate; TPP, tetraphenylphosphonium; PBFI, potassium-binding benzofuran isophthalate; 5-HD, 5-hydroxydecanoic acid; holo-mitoKATP, mitoKATP containing both of its subunits; NH, Hill coefficient. generated by the proton-pumping electron transport system, and excess K+ is removed by the regulated K+/H+ antiporter. Electrophoretic K+ influx occurs by diffusion and by means of ATP-sensitive potassium channel from the inner mitochondrial membrane (mitoKATP). At the high values of Δψ maintained by mitochondria, both of these processes increase exponentially with Δψ (3Paucek P. Mironova G. Mahdi F. Beavis A.D. Woldegiorgis G. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26062-26069Google Scholar, 4Garlid K.D. Beavis A.D. Ratkje S.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 976: 109-120Google Scholar) and are consequently very sensitive to fluctuations in Δψ. These fluctuations, in turn, are high in tissues such as heart, which undergo large variations in energy demand and ATP synthesis rates (5Kowaltowski A.J. Seetharaman S. Paucek P. Garlid K.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: H649-H657Google Scholar). Thus, regulation of K+ influx and efflux pathways can be seen as a means of regulating volume in the face of the changing energy requirements of the cell. MitoKATP plays more than a housekeeping role in cell physiology. There is now general agreement that mitoKATP plays a key role in cardioprotection against ischemia-reperfusion injury (6Garlid K.D. Paucek P. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Sun X. Schindler P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8796-8799Google Scholar, 7Garlid K.D. Paucek P. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Murray H.N. Darbenzio R.B. D'Alonzo A.J. Lodge N.J. Smith M.A. Grover G.J. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 1072-1082Google Scholar). The proposed mechanisms of this protective effect of mitoKATP opening (5Kowaltowski A.J. Seetharaman S. Paucek P. Garlid K.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: H649-H657Google Scholar, 8Garlid K.D. Basic Res. Cardiol. 2000; 95: 275-279Google Scholar, 9Dos Santos P. Kowaltowski A.J. Laclau M.N. Seetharaman S. Paucek P. Boudina S. Thambo J.B. Tariosse L. Garlid K.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: H284-H295Google Scholar) are plausible; however, it is evident that more needs to be known about the functional properties of mitoKATP before its role in vivo can be ascertained. By using a novel ethanol extraction technique, Mironova et al. (10Mironova G.D. Fedotcheva N.I. Makarov P.R. Pronevich L.A. Mironov G.P. Biophysical (USSR). 1981; 26: 458-465Google Scholar) were the first to report reconstitution in lipid bilayer membranes of a 55-kDa K+ channel from mitochondria. Paucek et al. (3Paucek P. Mironova G. Mahdi F. Beavis A.D. Woldegiorgis G. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26062-26069Google Scholar) used a detergent extraction technique and were the first to report reconstitution of mitoKATP in liposomes. The latter channel was associated with two proteins of molecular mass 55 and 63 kDa, and we hypothesized that mitoKATP is a heteromultimeric complex consisting of a 55-kDa inwardly rectifying K+ channel (mitoKIR) and a 63-kDa sulfonylurea receptor (mitoSUR), analogous to the plasma membrane ATP-dependent K+ channel (cellKATP) (11Grover G.J. Garlid K.D. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2000; 32: 677-695Google Scholar, 12Bajgar R. Seetharaman S. Kowaltowski A.J. Garlid K.D. Paucek P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33369-33374Google Scholar). In this report, we focus on three interactions that address the key question of whether the 55-kDa K+ channel protein observed in the ethanol purification is the same as the 55-kDa protein purified with detergents. First, we show that UDP reverses ATP-inhibition of K+ flux mediated by both mitoKIR and mitoKATP reconstituted in liposomes. Moreover, UDP exerts the same action in isolated mitochondria, and the affinities for the opening effect of UDP are about the same in each preparation. Second, we show that the mitoKIR opener p-diethylaminoethylbenzoate (DEB) also activates K+ flux via mitoKATP in isolated mitochondria and this effect is inhibited by 5-HD and glibenclamide. Third, we show that tetraphenylphosphonium ion (TPP+) inhibits reconstituted mitoKIR and mitoKATP with similar affinities. We conclude that the 55-kDa protein obtained by ethanol extraction is the channel component of mitoKATP. Mitochondrial Preparations—The experiments in this paper utilized mitochondria isolated from rat liver (13Pedersen P.L. Greenawalt J.W. Reynafarje B. Hullihen J. Decker G.L. Soper J.W. Bustamente E. Methods Cell Biol. 1978; 20: 411-481Google Scholar), rat heart (14Matlib M.A. Rouslin W. Vaghy P.L. Schwartz A. Methods Pharmacol. 1984; 5: 25-37Google Scholar), and rat brain cortex (15Rosenthal R.E. Hamud F. Fiskum G. Varghese P.J. Sharpe S. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1987; 7: 752-758Google Scholar). Different mitochondrial preparations were used in different protocols, largely for practical reasons. We have shown previously that the properties of liver, heart, and brain mitochondria are qualitatively and quantitatively similar (12Bajgar R. Seetharaman S. Kowaltowski A.J. Garlid K.D. Paucek P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33369-33374Google Scholar). Electrophysiological Measurements of mitoKir in Lipid Bilayer Membranes—Rat liver mitochondria were diluted to 7 mg of protein/ml with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), stirred for 20 min at 4 °C, and centrifuged at 7000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) to 44 mg of protein/ml, and this was diluted with 10 parts of 66% ethanol in water (–20 °C). After stirring for 30 min at 4 °C, the suspension was centrifuged at 7000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was dialyzed overnight against 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.5 g/liter mercaptoethanol at 4 °C. The dialyzed sample was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min to remove remaining particulate matter and then loaded onto a 1-ml DEAE-cellulose column pre-equilibrated with column buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 g/liter mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.4). The bound proteins were eluted with a KCl step gradient, and the active fraction was eluted with 250 mm KCl (16Mironova G.D. Skarga Y.Y. Grigoriev S.M. Yarov-Yarovoy V.M. Alexandrov A.V. Kolomytkin O.V. Membr. Cell Biol. 1996; 10: 429-437Google Scholar). This fraction was dialyzed against column buffer for 3 h, applied to a second DEAE column (1 ml), and again eluted with a KCI step gradient, to be recovered in the 250 mm KCl fraction. Ion conductance of the partially purified 55-kDa protein, mitoKIR, was measured in lipid bilayer membranes (17Mueller P. Rudin D.O. Tien H. Wescott W. Nature. 1962; 194: 979-981Google Scholar) using bovine brain lipid (20 mg/ml) plus 10% cardiolipin dissolved in decane. The solution on both sides of the bilayer contained 100 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). Potentials (10–100 mV) were applied across the membrane, and currents were registered using an operational amplifier (AD 711C, Analog Devices). Potassium Flux Measurements of Holo-mitoKATP in Liposomes—Rat brain mitochondria were solubilized in Triton X-100 and purified on DEAE-cellulose, as described previously (12Bajgar R. Seetharaman S. Kowaltowski A.J. Garlid K.D. Paucek P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33369-33374Google Scholar). The active fraction, eluting with 250 mm KCl, was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against column buffer and reconstituted into liposomes containing potassium-binding benzofuran isophthalate (PBFI) (12Bajgar R. Seetharaman S. Kowaltowski A.J. Garlid K.D. Paucek P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33369-33374Google Scholar). Proteins in the fraction were visualized by Coomassie Blue R-250 staining of SDS-PAGE gels (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). The internal medium contained tetraethylammonium cation (TEA+) salts of sulfate (100 mm), EDTA (1 mm), HEPES (25 mm), pH 6.8, and 2 mm PBFI. 15 μl of stock vesicles (50 mg phospholipid/ml of stock) were diluted in 2 ml of external medium containing 150 mm KCl, 1 mm TEA-EDTA, 1mm MgCl2, and 25 mm TEA-HEPES (pH 7.2). Electrophoretic K+ flux was initiated by the addition of 0.3 μm carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (to provide charge compensation via H+ efflux), and the K+ influx was recorded as increased fluorescence of intraliposomal PBFI using an SLM/Aminco 8000C fluorescence spectrophotometer (λex/λem = 345/485 nm). The K+ response of intravesicular PBFI was calibrated by stepwise additions of KCl to proteoliposomes in the internal medium after the addition of 0.5 μm nigericin and 1 μm tributyltin (19Garlid K.D. Sun X. Paucek P. Woldegiorgis G. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 331-348Google Scholar). Results are plotted as a normalized flux value ΔJ/ΔJcontrol, where ΔJcontrol is the difference between fluxes in the absence and presence of 200 μm ATP, and ΔJ is the difference between fluxes in the presence or absence of the KATP channel opener or blocker tested. K1/2 values and Hill coefficients were determined from non-linear least-square-fitting to the Hill equation. Potassium Flux Measurements of MitoKIR in Liposomes—Rat brain mitochondria were diluted to 10 mg/ml in distilled water, then diluted with 10 parts of 66% ethanol solution in water (–20 °C). The remainder of the extraction and purification on DEAE-cellulose followed the procedure described for mitoKIR studies in lipid bilayer membranes (see above). This active fraction was visualized by silver staining (Bio-Rad) of SDS-PAGE gels (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). The final mitoKir fraction was incorporated into PBFI-containing liposomes using the same technique and buffers described above for mitoKATP obtained by Triton X-100 extraction. Potassium Flux Measurements of Rat Heart Holo-mitoKATP in Mitochondria—Rat heart mitochondria were assayed for electrophoretic K+ uptake by following light-scattering secondary to osmotic swelling (5Kowaltowski A.J. Seetharaman S. Paucek P. Garlid K.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: H649-H657Google Scholar, 20Beavis A.D. Brannan R.D. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13424-13433Google Scholar, 21Garlid K.D. Beavis A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13434-13441Google Scholar, 22Jaburek M. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Paucek P. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13578-13582Google Scholar). Assay medium contained 2 μm rotenone, 1 μm oligomycin, 5 μm cytochrome c, 50 mm K+ salts of chloride, 5 mm phosphate, 0.1 mm EGTA, 5 mm succinate, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. Chemicals—PBFI was purchased from Molecular Probes; electrophoresis chemicals and SM-2 Bio-Beads from Bio-Rad; l-soybean lecithin from Avanti; and column resins, nucleotides, ionophores, buffers, and other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Isolation and Partial Purification of Holo-mitoKATP and MitoKIR from Rat Liver Mitochondria—Fig. 1 contains the SDS-PAGE gel patterns of the two preparations described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 1, lane 1 contains standards; lane 2 contains the reconstitutively active mitoKATP fraction isolated and purified in the presence of Triton X-100. This fraction contains two bands, at 55 and 63 kDa, and presents the same appearance as mitoKATP isolated from rat brain mitochondria (12Bajgar R. Seetharaman S. Kowaltowski A.J. Garlid K.D. Paucek P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33369-33374Google Scholar). Fig. 1, lane 3 contains the reconstitutively active mitoKIR fraction extracted with ethanol and purified in the absence of detergents. This fraction contains a single 55-kDa protein band. It should be noted that 2-dimensional electrophoresis reveals that each of these bands contains at least five different proteins. The Effects of ATP and Mg2+on MitoKIR and Holo-mitoKATP—Fig. 2 contains the concentration dependence of ATP inhibition of the channels in the presence (•) or absence (○) of 500 μm Mg2+. These experiments were performed on four different preparations: lipid bilayer membranes containing mitoKIR (Fig. 2A), liposomes containing mitoKIR (Fig. 2B), liposomes containing holo-mitoKATP (Fig. 2C), and isolated mitochondria containing holo-mitoKATP (Fig. 2D). We note the following general characteristics of these preparations with respect to ATP inhibition: (i) the apparent affinities for ATP differ widely, with K1/2 values of about 600 μm in liposomes or lipid bilayer membranes containing mitoKIR, 20–30 μm in liposomes containing holo-mitoKATP (3Paucek P. Mironova G. Mahdi F. Beavis A.D. Woldegiorgis G. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26062-26069Google Scholar, 23Paucek P. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Sun X. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32084-32088Google Scholar), and 1 μm in mitochondria; (ii) ATP inhibition of holo-mitoKATP in liposomes or mitochondria exhibits an absolute requirement for Mg2+ (3Paucek P. Mironova G. Mahdi F. Beavis A.D. Woldegiorgis G. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26062-26069Google Scholar, 23Paucek P. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Sun X. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32084-32088Google Scholar), whereas ATP inhibition of mitoKIR is indifferent to Mg2+; (iii) we always observed a 10-fold higher ATP affinity in isolated mitochondria over liposomes (24Beavis A.D. Lu Y. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 997-1004Google Scholar), and we have no explanation for this finding at present. The Effects of Cromakalim, Diazoxide, Glibenclamide, and 5-HD on MitoKIR and Holo-mitoKATP—In additional experiments (data not shown), we found that the K+ conductance catalyzed by mitoKIR in lipid bilayer membranes and in liposomes is insensitive to 5-HD (50–500 μm), glibenclamide (1–10 μm), cromakalim (10–100 μm), and diazoxide (1–30 μm). In contrast, each of these agents has been shown to be a potent modulator of holo-mitoKATP (3Paucek P. Mironova G. Mahdi F. Beavis A.D. Woldegiorgis G. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26062-26069Google Scholar, 7Garlid K.D. Paucek P. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Murray H.N. Darbenzio R.B. D'Alonzo A.J. Lodge N.J. Smith M.A. Grover G.J. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 1072-1082Google Scholar, 22Jaburek M. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Paucek P. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13578-13582Google Scholar, 25Garlid K.D. Orosz D.E. Modrianský M. Vassanelli S. Jezek P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2615-2620Google Scholar). The Effects of UDP upon MitoKIR Reconstituted in Lipid Bilayer Membranes—When reconstituted in lipid bilayer membranes, the 55-kDa protein forms potassium channels with a unitary conductance of about 10 pS (16Mironova G.D. Skarga Y.Y. Grigoriev S.M. Yarov-Yarovoy V.M. Alexandrov A.V. Kolomytkin O.V. Membr. Cell Biol. 1996; 10: 429-437Google Scholar, 26Inoue I. Nagase H. Kishi K. Higuti T. Nature. 1991; 352: 244-247Google Scholar, 27Mironova G.D. Skarga Y.Y. Grigoriev S.M. Negoda A.E. Kolomytkin O.V. Marinov B.S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 159-163Google Scholar). The current-voltage plot of the channel exhibits characteristic rectifying properties, as shown in Fig. 3A. We frequently observed conductances of up to 100 pS (Fig. 3B), which we have interpreted as clusters of 10 elementary channels (28Mironova G.D. Grigoriev S.M. Skarga Y. Negoda A.E. Kolomytkin O.V. Membr. Cell. Biol. 1997; 10: 583-591Google Scholar). Note that in Fig. 3B, current is inhibited by 1 mm ATP, and the ATP-inhibited current is restored by 20 μm UDP. Therefore, UDP is a mitoKIR opener. It can be seen in Fig. 3B that UDP restored K+ conductance to levels higher than those in the control. We attribute this overshoot to UDP activation of channels that had lost their activity with time. Spontaneous decline in channel activity (rundown) has been described previously for both mitoKIR (29Grigoriev S.M. Skarga Y.Y. Mironova G.D. Marinov B.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1410: 91-96Google Scholar) and cellKATP (30Findlay I. Dunne M.J. Pflügers Arch. 1986; 407: 238-240Google Scholar). We discovered that the loss of channel activity because of rundown could be reversed by the addition of 100–300 μm UDP (Fig. 3C). UTP was less effective than UDP, and UMP and CDP had no effect (results not shown). UDP Opens MitoKIR and Holo-mitoKATP—Fig. 4A contains representative K+ flux traces from liposomes reconstituted with holo-mitoKATP. Electrophoretic K+ flux (Fig. 4A, trace a) was inhibited by 200 μm ATP (Fig. 4A, trace d), and flux was partially restored by 100 μm UDP (Fig. 4A, trace b). The reactivation by UDP was largely abolished in the presence of 200 μm 5-HD, a specific inhibitor of mitoKATP (22Jaburek M. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Paucek P. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13578-13582Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A, trace c). Fig. 4B contains representative swelling traces from isolated mitochondria containing holo-mitoKATP. As reported previously (22Jaburek M. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Paucek P. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13578-13582Google Scholar), matrix swelling secondary to K+ uptake (Fig. 4B, trace a) was inhibited in the presence of 100 μm ATP (Fig. 4B, trace d). Swelling was restored by the addition of 30 μm UDP (Fig. 4B, trace b) and re-inhibited by 200 μm 5-HD (Fig. 4B, trace c). In the absence of added ATP, UDP did not enhance mitochondrial K+ uptake (data not shown). Each of these traces was duplicated in medium containing TEA+ instead of K+. As we showed previously for ATP (22Jaburek M. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Paucek P. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13578-13582Google Scholar, 24Beavis A.D. Lu Y. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 997-1004Google Scholar), none of these agents had any effect upon the light-scattering signal in TEA+ medium, showing that the matrix swelling was due specifically to uptake of K+ salts and water. The data in Fig. 5 compare the UDP concentration dependences for reactivation of mitoKIR in lipid bilayer membranes (Fig. 5A) and of holo-mitoKATP in liposomes (Fig. 5B). The K1/2 (UDP) is 10–13 μm in both preparations. In additional experiments (not shown), we found that the K1/2 (UDP) was not affected by increasing the ATP concentration to 500 μm in liposomes and 3 mm in lipid bilayer membranes. Thus, UDP interaction with mitoKATP seems to be non-competitive with ATP. DEB Opens MitoKIR and Holo-mitoKATP—DEB, functioning as an electron donor, was previously shown to reverse ATP inhibition of mitoKIR at micromolar concentrations (29Grigoriev S.M. Skarga Y.Y. Mironova G.D. Marinov B.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1410: 91-96Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that DEB also reversed ATP inhibition of K+ flux through holo-mitoKATP in isolated rat heart mitochondria (Fig. 6A). Opening by DEB was inhibited by 5-HD (50 μm) and glibenclamide (2 μm) (Fig. 6A). The concentration-dependence of DEB opening of mitoKATP in mitochondria is shown in Fig. 6B, with K1/2 about 10 μm. TPP+Inhibits MitoKIR and Holo-mitoKATP—100 nm TPP+ was found to inhibit the conductance of lipid bilayer membranes containing mitoKIR (Fig. 7A). TPP+ also inhibited mitoKIR and holo-mitoKATP reconstituted in liposomes, with K1/2 of 44–50 nm (Fig. 7B). For insights into mitoKATP function, it is useful to consider the salient aspects of plasma membrane KATP channels (cellKATP). CellKATP consists of two subunits, an inward-rectifying potassium channel, Kir6.1 or Kir6.2, and a regulatory sulfonylurea receptor, SUR1, SUR2A, or SUR2B (see review by Ashcroft and Ashcroft, Ref. 31Ashcroft S.J. Ashcroft F.M. Cell. Signal. 1990; 2: 197-214Google Scholar). The SUR are members of the ABC-binding cassette family (32Higgins C.F. Cell. 1995; 82: 693-696Google Scholar), and tetramers of KIRx and SURx peptides form functional hetero-octamers in the plasma membrane (33Clement J.P.T. Kunjilwar K. Gonzalez G. Schwanstecher M. Panten U. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 827-838Google Scholar). An RKR domain in the C terminus of KIR6.x and in the 6th intracellular loop of SUR prevents membrane expression of either of these proteins in the absence of its partner (34Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Google Scholar). However, C-terminal truncations of KIR6.2 permit expression and measurements of channel activities (35Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Zhao C. Trapp S. Ashcroft F.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 179-183Google Scholar). These studies have shown that ATP inhibits cellKATP by interacting with KIR and that SUR1 enhances the direct blockage of KIR6.2 by ATP by an unknown mechanism that involves the N terminus of KIR6.2. Sulfonylureas and KATP channel openers interact with sites on SUR (35Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Zhao C. Trapp S. Ashcroft F.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 179-183Google Scholar, 36Babenko A.P. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Ann. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 667-687Google Scholar). MitoKATP and cellKATP react with the similar ligands, including K+ channel openers, sulfonylureas, nucleotides, and long-chain CoA esters. On this basis, we have proposed that they belong to the same gene family (37Garlid K.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 123-126Google Scholar). Although verification of this hypothesis awaits the molecular structure of mitoKATP, the functional parallels with cellKATP lead to the working model contained in Fig. 8. Thus, the 55-kDa band seen in both preparations of Fig. 1 contains mitoKIR, and the 63-kDa band seen only in the detergent-extracted preparation contains mitoSUR (12Bajgar R. Seetharaman S. Kowaltowski A.J. Garlid K.D. Paucek P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33369-33374Google Scholar). A key question addressed by this report is whether the channel activity of the detergent-extracted mitoKATP (3Paucek P. Mironova G. Mahdi F. Beavis A.D. Woldegiorgis G. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26062-26069Google Scholar) is the same as that of the ethanol-extracted mitoKIR (10Mironova G.D. Fedotcheva N.I. Makarov P.R. Pronevich L.A. Mironov G.P. Biophysical (USSR). 1981; 26: 458-465Google Scholar). There is considerable evidence favoring this proposal: both fractions contain the 55-kDa band (Fig. 1), both channels are K+-selective (3Paucek P. Mironova G. Mahdi F. Beavis A.D. Woldegiorgis G. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26062-26069Google Scholar, 16Mironova G.D. Skarga Y.Y. Grigoriev S.M. Yarov-Yarovoy V.M. Alexandrov A.V. Kolomytkin O.V. Membr. Cell Biol. 1996; 10: 429-437Google Scholar), both manifest an ∼10-pS single-channel conductance in 100 mm KCl (16Mironova G.D. Skarga Y.Y. Grigoriev S.M. Yarov-Yarovoy V.M. Alexandrov A.V. Kolomytkin O.V. Membr. Cell Biol. 1996; 10: 429-437Google Scholar, 38Yarov Yarovoy V. Paucek P. Jaburek M. Garlid K.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1321: 128-136Google Scholar), and both channels are inhibited by ATP (Fig. 2). The 55-kDa protein isolated with ethanol is an inwardly rectifying K+ channel, mitoKIR (Fig. 3A), and the 63-kDa band is labeled with high affinity by sulfonylurea (12Bajgar R. Seetharaman S. Kowaltowski A.J. Garlid K.D. Paucek P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33369-33374Google Scholar), consistent with identification of the 63-kDa band with mitoSUR (11Grover G.J. Garlid K.D. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2000; 32: 677-695Google Scholar). It is also clear that the detergent-isolated fraction (holo-mitoKATP) differs from the ethanol-extracted fraction mitoKIR) in its regulation. Thus, ATP inhibition of holo-mitoKATP exhibits an absolute requirement for Mg2+ ions, and the apparent affinity for ATP is an order of magnitude higher (Fig. 2). Pharmacological blockers, such as glibenclamide and 5-HD, and pharmacological openers, such as cromakalim and diazoxide (6Garlid K.D. Paucek P. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Sun X. Schindler P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8796-8799Google Scholar, 7Garlid K.D. Paucek P. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Murray H.N. Darbenzio R.B. D'Alonzo A.J. Lodge N.J. Smith M.A. Grover G.J. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 1072-1082Google Scholar, 22Jaburek M. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Paucek P. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13578-13582Google Scholar), are potent regulators of holo-mitoKATP; however, these agents have no effect upon channel activity of the mitoKIR subunit (28Mironova G.D. Grigoriev S.M. Skarga Y. Negoda A.E. Kolomytkin O.V. Membr. Cell. Biol. 1997; 10: 583-591Google Scholar, 29Grigoriev S.M. Skarga Y.Y. Mironova G.D. Marinov B.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1410: 91-96Google Scholar). CellKATP exhibits similar properties. Thus, co-expression of SUR1 and KIR6.2ΔC36 resulted in ATP inhibition with higher affinity than expression of KIR6.2ΔC36 alone (35Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Zhao C. Trapp S. Ashcroft F.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 179-183Google Scholar). Moreover, holo-cellKATP was sensitive to sulfonylureas and diazoxide, whereas KIR6.2ΔC36 was not (35Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Zhao C. Trapp S. Ashcroft F.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 179-183Google Scholar). Thus, the differences in regulation of mitoKIR and holo-mitoKATP can be rationalized by assuming that mitoKATP is a close relative of cellKATP. For a more direct test of the hypothesis that the 55-kDa protein is the channel component of mitoKATP, we focused on three new regulatory interactions with mitoKIR and holo-mitoKATP. We found that 20 μm UDP reversed ATP inhibition of mitoKIR in lipid bilayer membranes (Fig. 3B), and 100–300 μm UDP rescued mitoKIR from channel rundown (Fig. 3C). UDP also reversed ATP inhibition of holo-mitoKATP in liposomes (Fig. 4A) and in intact mitochondria (Fig. 4B). MitoKIR and holo-mitoKATP were opened by UDP with similar affinities of 10–13 μm (Fig. 5). UDP seems to be non-competitive with ATP. UDP is the first nucleotide shown to open mitoKATP via the mitoKIR subunit, but there is precedent for this action from studies on cellKATP: oleoyl CoA opens β-cell KATP (39Branstrom R. Corkey B.E. Berggren P.O. Larsson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17390-17394Google Scholar), and this effect has been shown to be mediated by means of the KIR 6.2 subunit (40Branstrom R. Leibiger I.B. Leibiger B. Corkey B.E. Berggren P.O. Larsson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31395-31400Google Scholar, 41Gribble F.M. Proks P. Corkey B.E. Ashcroft F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26383-26387Google Scholar). TPP+ is commonly used to estimate mitochondrial membrane potential. It is also a potent inhibitor of holo-mitoKATP and mitoKIR (Fig. 7). Indeed, the apparent affinities of mitoKIR and holo-mitoKATP for TPP+ are identical: ∼60 nm. We suggested previously (29Grigoriev S.M. Skarga Y.Y. Mironova G.D. Marinov B.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1410: 91-96Google Scholar) that some agents may regulate the activity of mitoKATP via intraprotein electron transport, and we showed that micromolar concentrations of the electroneutral reducing agent, DEB, opens the ATP-inhibited channel in lipid bilayer membranes. The DEB-activated mitoKIR can be re-inhibited by pelargonidine, an electron acceptor. Here we show that DEB also opens holo-mitoKATP in isolated mitochondria (Fig. 6A) and in liposomes reconstituted with mitoKATP (Fig. 6B). Whereas DEB-activated mitoKIR is not inhibited by 5-HD or glibenclamide, DEB-activated mitoKATP is inhibited by both agents, consistent with their presumed effect upon mitoSUR. Our strategy in these studies was to identify agents that act directly on mitoKIR and then to determine whether they have similar actions upon holo-mitoKATP. This was found to be the case for UDP, DEB, and TPP+ (summarized in Fig. 8). On the basis of these results, we conclude that the ethanol-extracted mitoKIR is the channel responsible for the channel activity of mitoKATP. We thank Margarita Nesterova, Craig Semrad, and Jarmilla Pauckova for excellent technical support."

Exchange of RecA between free and bound forms was almost entirely suppressed, and highly stable filaments were documented with several different experimental methods. DinI-mediated stabilization did not affect RecA-mediated ATP hydrolysis and LexA co-protease activities. Initiation of DNA strand exchange was affected in a DNA structure-dependent manner, whereas ongoing strand exchange was not affected. Destabilization of RecA filaments occurred as reported in earlier work but only when DinI protein was present at very high concentrations, generally superstoichiometric, relative to the RecA protein concentration. DinI did not facilitate RecA filament formation but stabilized the filaments only after they were formed. The interaction between the RecA protein and DinI was modulated by the C terminus of RecA.

We discuss these results in the context of a new hypothesis for the role of DinI in the regulation of recombination and the SOS response. The RecA protein plays a principle role in the processes of homologous recombinational DNA repair (reviewed in Refs. 1Lusetti S.L. Cox M.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 71-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 2Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 63: 310-366Google Scholar, 3Cox M.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 57: 551-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In addition to its direct involvement in the repair of stalled replication forks, RecA regulates multiple repair pathways via its role in the induction of the SOS response (4Walker G.C. Smith B.T. Sutton M.D. Storz G. Hengge-Aronis R. Bacterial Stress Responses. 1. American Society of Microbiology, Washington, D. C.2000: 131-144Google Scholar), and is required for translesion DNA synthesis by DNA polymerase V (5Goodman M.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 17-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). RecA nucleates onto regions of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) 1The abbreviations used are: ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; nt, nucleotide(s); DTT, dithiothreitol; SSB, single-stranded DNA-binding protein; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotri-phosphate); ExoI, exonuclease I.1The abbreviations used are: ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; nt, nucleotide(s); DTT, dithiothreitol; SSB, single-stranded DNA-binding protein; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotri-phosphate); ExoI, exonuclease I. that develop as a result of DNA damage and forms a helical nucleoprotein filament. This ATP-dependent activated RecA filament interacts with and promotes the autocatalytic cleavage of the LexA repressor protein, thereby inducing the genes of the SOS regulon (6Little J.W. Biochimie (Paris). 1991; 73: 411-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Whereas the mechanism of SOS induction has been well studied, the means by which the SOS response is terminated is not clear. The biochemical data available for the Escherichia coli RecA protein and the reactions that it catalyzes (ATP hydrolysis and DNA strand exchange) are abundant (1Lusetti S.L. Cox M.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 71-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 7Roca A.I. Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 56: 129-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but we are just beginning to understand the complex layers of regulation to which RecA is subject. The C-terminal 25 amino acid residues play a role in autoregulation of RecA function. Removal of just 17 C-terminal amino acid residues (RecAΔC17) has a dramatic and positive effect on the capacity of RecA protein to bind to duplex DNA (8Lusetti S.L. Wood E.A. Fleming C.D. Modica M.J.

Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16389-16396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and to carry out DNA strand exchange in the absence of free Mg2+ (10Lusetti S.L. Shaw J.J. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16381-16388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The complete C-terminal domain is larger, consisting of residues 270–352. The last invariant residue among 64 bacterial RecA species is Gly-301, and the sequence alignments indicate very little conservation in residues from 301 to the C-terminal residues. Most but not all bacterial RecA proteins, including the RecA of E. coli, contain a high concentration of negatively charged residues at their far C termini (7Roca A.I. Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 56: 129-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RecA protein function is also regulated by other proteins in bacteria. The RecFOR proteins modulate the assembly and disassembly of RecA filaments on DNA (11Shan Q. Bork J.M. Webb B.L. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 519-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 12Umezu K. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30005-30013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Webb B.L. Cox M.M.

Finally, the DinI protein also inhibits RecA function, and this protein has a postulated role in the termination of the SOS response (16Voloshin O.N. Ramirez B.E. Bax A. Camerini-Otero R.D. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 17Yasuda T. Morimatsu K. Kato R. Usukura J. Takahashi M. Ohmori H.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1735-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The interaction between DinI and RecA and the functional consequences of that interaction are the subject of the present report. The dinI gene was first identified by David Mount and colleagues (19Lewis L.K. Harlow G.R. Greggjolly L.A. Mount D.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 507-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) as a chromosomal locus containing a high affinity operator for the LexA repressor. Subsequently, the dinI gene was isolated as a multicopy suppressor of the cold-sensitive SOS induction phenotype of the dinD68 mutation (20Yasuda T. Nagata T. Ohmori H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3854-3859Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The gene encodes a small protein with 80 amino acids and an Mr of 8818 if the N-terminal Met residue is removed. Over-expression of the dinI gene from a multicopy plasmid conferred UV sensitivity and suppressed induction of the SOS response by mitomycin C (21Yasuda T. Morimatsu K. Horii T. Nagata T. Ohmori H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3207-3216Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Purified DinI protein has been shown to interact with both active and inactive forms of RecA (16Voloshin O.N. Ramirez B.E. Bax A. Camerini-Otero R.D. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 17Yasuda T. Morimatsu K. Kato R. Usukura J. Takahashi M. Ohmori H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1192-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). By comparing relative binding affinities for the RecA filament, Yasuda et al. (17Yasuda T. Morimatsu K. Kato R. Usukura J. Takahashi M. Ohmori H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1192-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) determined that LexA bound tighter than DinI, which in turn bound tighter than UmuD. Recently, Yoshimasu et al. (18Yoshimasu M. Aihara H. Ito Y. Rajesh S. Ishibe S. Mikawa T. Yokoyama S. Shibata T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1735-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) found that DinI binds RecA at the RecA core domain. Specific interactions have previously been detected with a DNA-binding segment of the core of RecA called loop 2 (16Voloshin O.N. Ramirez B.E. Bax A. Camerini-Otero R.D. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Shibata and co-workers (18Yoshimasu M. Aihara H. Ito Y. Rajesh S. Ishibe S. Mikawa T. Yokoyama S. Shibata T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1735-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) suggest that DinI binds the RecA nucleoprotein filament in the major filament groove, in the same site or region that binds UmuD (22Mustard J.A. Little J.W. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1659-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This groove is the “gateway” for double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) entry (23Kurumizaka H. Aihara H. Ikawa S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 23874-23883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This region of RecA is the region that we have suggested is blocked by the C terminus at low magnesium ion concentrations (10Lusetti S.L. Shaw J.J. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16381-16388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The actual effect of DinI on RecA filaments has been the subject of some controversy. Some of us (16Voloshin O.N. Ramirez B.E. Bax A. Camerini-Otero R.D. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) previously showed that added DinI protein disrupts RecA filaments, accounting for several inhibitory effects of DinI. Another study (17Yasuda T. Morimatsu K. Kato R. Usukura J. Takahashi M. Ohmori H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1192-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) indicated that RecA filaments remain intact after DinI addition. In this report, we further explore the DinI-RecA interaction. DinI protein destabilizes RecA filaments, but only at very high DinI concentrations. At lower, more nearly stoichiometric concentrations, DinI has a very substantial stabilizing effect on RecA filaments and does not significantly inhibit many RecA functions. We further demonstrate that the RecA C terminus modulates the interaction between DinI and RecA. Enzymes and Biochemicals—The E. coli wild-type RecA and RecAΔC17 mutant proteins were purified as described (8Lusetti S.L. Wood E.A. Fleming C.D. Modica M.J. Korth J. Abbott L. Dwyer D.W. Roca A.I.

The presynaptic filament was formed by preparing a master mix of 500 nm 55T, 32P phosphorylated at its 5′ terminus, and 600 nm RecA in the presence of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm DTT, and 1 mm ATPγS for 30 min at 37 °C. 18 μl of the presynaptic filament mix was transferred to a fresh tube containing 2 μl of DinI in DinI storage buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10% (w/v) glycerol) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The final concentrations of DinI were 0, 3.5, 5.3, 8, 12, and 18 μm. After incubation, each reaction mixture was split in half. One-half was mixed with 2.5 μl of 5× DNA gel loading solution (Quality Biological) and subjected to electrophoresis in a 8% (19:1) polyacrylamide gel prepared in a 100 × 100 × 1-mm Invitrogen cassette in Tris borate-EDTA (TBE, purchased from KD Medical) buffer supplemented with 3 mm MgCl2. Electrophoresis was conducted at room temperature at a constant 125 V for 50 min. Under these electrophoretic conditions, the absence of RecA-DNA complexes in the absence of DinI may reflect destabilization due to gel warming. The second half of the reaction was treated with 500 units/ml exonuclease I (purchased from United States Biochemical) for 15 min at 37 °C. ExoI reactions were stopped by the addition of 5 μl (per 10 μl of reaction) of a solution containing 60 mm EDTA, 6% SDS, 30% glycerol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue. Five μl of the samples were electrophoresed in 0.4-mm 20% SequaGel (National Diagnostics) denaturing gels, and the marker dyes were all allowed to migrate for 17 cm. Images of the radioactive gels were obtained with a Fuji BAS 2500 phosphorimaging system. Electron Microscopy of Poly(dT)-RecA Nucleoprotein Filaments—A modified Alcian method was used to visualize RecA filaments. Activated grids were prepared as described previously (8Lusetti S.L. Wood E.A. Fleming C.D. Modica M.J. Korth J. Abbott L. Dwyer D.W. Roca A.I. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16372-16380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Samples for electron microscopy were prepared by preincubating the indicated amount of RecA and poly(dT) ssDNA, 25 mm Tris-OAc (80% cation) buffer, 1 mm DTT, 5% (w/v) glycerol, 3 mm potassium glutamate, and 10 mm Mg(OAc)2 for 10 min at 37 °C. An ATP regeneration system of 12 mm phosphocreatine and 10 units/ml creatine phosphokinase was also included in the preincubation. ATP was added to 3 mm, followed by another 10-min incubation. In reactions that contain DinI protein, the DinI protein was added following a 5-min incubation after the addition of ATP followed by another 5-min incubation. Where indicated, ATPγS was added followed by another 3-min incubation. The reaction mixture described above was diluted as indicated with 200 mm ammonium acetate, 2 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, and 8 μl of the diluted sample was adsorbed to the activated carbon film for 3 min. The grid was then touched to a drop of the above described buffer followed by floating on a drop of the same buffer for 30 s. The sample was stained by touching to a drop of 5% uranyl acetate followed by floating on a fresh drop of the same solution. Finally the grid was washed by touching to a drop of water followed by immersion in two 10-ml beakers of water and one beaker of ethyl alcohol. After the sample was dried, it was rotary shadowed with platinum. This protocol is designed for visualization of complete reaction mixtures, and no attempt was made to remove unreacted material. Although this approach should yield results that give a true insight into reaction components, it does lead to samples with a high background of unreacted proteins. DNA Three-strand Exchange Reactions—All of the following reagent concentrations represent final concentrations after the addition of all reaction components. DNA three-strand exchange reactions were carried out in 25 mm Tris-OAc buffer (80% cation), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% (w/v) glycerol, 3 mm potassium glutamate, and the indicated concentration of Mg(OAc)2. Reactions also contained an ATP regeneration system consisting of 10 units/ml pyruvate kinase and 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate. All incubations were carried out at 37 °C. The wild-type or ΔC17 RecA proteins (3 μm) were preincubated with 10 μm ϕX174 circular ssDNA for 10 min. SSB protein (1 μm) and ATP (3 mm) were then added followed by another 10-min incubation. In reactions that contained DinI protein, the DinI protein was added following a 5-min incubation after the addition of SSB and ATP followed by another 5-min incubation. The reactions were initiated by the addition of ϕX174 linear dsDNA to 10 μm and incubated for 60 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 μl (per 10 μl of reaction) of a solution containing 60 mm EDTA, 6% SDS, 25% (w/v) glycerol, and 0.2% bromphenol blue. Samples were electrophoresed at 10–20 mA in 0.8% agarose gels with 1 × TAE (40 mm Tris-OAc, 80% cation, and 1 mm EDTA), stained with ethidium bromide, and exposed to ultraviolet light. Gel images were captured with a digital CCD camera using GelExpert software (Nucleotech). When indicated the DNA bands were quantitated with the TotalLab software package (version 1.10) from Phoretix. Surface Plasmon Resonance Measurements—Experiments were performed on a Biacore 3000 instrument (BIAcore) at 25 °C. The flow buffer was 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm DTT, and 0.005% surfactant P20 (purchased from BIAcore). The wild-type DinI protein was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip to give a signal of 570 response units using an amine coupling kit from BIAcore. A control (empty) surface was created in the same batch run. The same chip was used for all the measurements described in this work. The wild-type RecA protein was injected at concentrations of 0, 64, 128, 256, 512, and 1024 nm; for the ΔC17 RecA mutant we used concentrations of 0, 32, 64, 128, 256, and 512 nm. The contact time was 5 min at a flow rate of 50 μl/min. After injection, the complex was allowed to dissociate for 6 min. The surfaces were regenerated by two consecutive injections, 50 μl each, of 3 m NaCl in the flow buffer. After subtraction of the control surface signals, we used BIAevaluation software, version 4.0.1, to fit experimental curves to the Langmuir model, which describes the simplest 1:1 binding of the analyte to the ligand. Despite the fact that the DinI-RecA interaction is more complex than assumed by this model, we obtained the best agreement of our experimental data with theoretically simulated curves using this particular fitting mode. Therefore, rate and equilibrium constants of the DinI-RecA interactions generated in this manner should be considered as “apparent” and should be used only for purposes of comparing the wild-type and mutant RecA proteins. There were two areas of investigation: the effects of DinI on RecA filament stability and the role of the RecA C terminus in the DinI-RecA interaction. To examine the effects of DinI on RecA filaments, we first explored the DNA-dependent RecA mediated ATPase activity. In many respects, the RecA ATPase is a sensitive barometer of RecA filament status, and it has often been used as a real-time indicator of the level of RecA protein binding to DNA (3Cox M.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 57: 551-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 7Roca A.I. Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 56: 129-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Shan Q.

We thus titrated the DinI protein into a reaction in which RecA protein was bound to ssDNA and hydrolyzing ATP. We carried out the ATPase assays using poly(dT) ssDNA as a cofactor to avoid the use of SSB protein while at the same time avoiding any complications due to secondary structure in the DNA. On such linear ssDNA molecules, the observed ATP hydrolysis reflects a steady state in which RecA filaments are constantly assembling and disassembling in an end-dependent fashion (3Cox M.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 57: 551-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 7Roca A.I. Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 56: 129-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Shan Q.

At constant protein concentrations of RecA protein (1 μm) and ssDNA (3 μm), increasing the amount of DinI protein initially enhanced the rate of ATP hydrolysis by the wild-type RecA protein (Fig. 1). No measurable ATP hydrolysis was observed when RecA was omitted from the reaction (data not shown), so the added ATP hydrolysis did not come from DinI or a contaminant in the DinI preparation. Without DinI protein, the RecA protein hydrolyzes ATP at a rate of 16 μm/min. This rate is lower than that observed on circular ssDNA because the steady state RecA filament disassembly and re-assembly on the poly(dT) leaves the DNA only partly bound by RecA at any given moment (11Shan Q. Bork J.M. Webb B.L. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 519-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 30Arenson T.A. Tsodikov O.V. Cox M.M. J. Mol.

The added DinI protein initially appears to stabilize the RecA filament on linear ssDNA. The maximum observed rate of hydrolysis by the RecA protein, seen with DinI concentrations from about 7 to 18 μm, was very similar to the rates observed when the same concentration of RecA protein is bound to circular ssDNA (∼30 μm/min), and were consistent with those expected when RecA protein has saturated the available DNA binding sites (3Cox M.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 57: 551-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 7Roca A.I. Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 56: 129-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The result suggested that DinI is inhibiting the end-dependent disassembly of RecA filaments, facilitating the assembly process, or both. As additional DinI protein was added to the reaction, the ATPase rates began to decline. At 100 μm DinI, the rate of ATP hydrolysis had declined by more than 80%. The highest DinI concentrations used were comparable with those used in our previous study (16Voloshin O.N. Ramirez B.E. Bax A. Camerini-Otero R.D. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) documenting a disruption of RecA filaments. We now suggest that the interaction of DinI with RecA filaments is more complex, disrupting the filaments only at very high concentrations. The lower concentrations of DinI appear to have the opposite effect, substantially stabilizing RecA filaments on ssDNA. Because a stabilization effect had not been observed previously, we set out to confirm and characterize it in several ways. Whenever the indirect ATPase assay is utilized to monitor RecA binding to DNA, it is always possible that some reagent (in this case DinI) is affecting the inherent ATPase activity rather than actually increasing the level of binding. To distinguish between these possibilities, a RecA protein titration was carried out in the presence and absence of the DinI protein (Fig. 2). Without DinI, a nearly 5-fold excess of RecA protein (beyond the one monomer per three nucleotides that represents the amount of RecA that theoretically can be bound to ssDNA) is required to reach a maximal rate of ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 2, open squares). This is again because of the continuous assembly and disassembly of RecA filaments on the linear ssDNA. At stoichiometric concentrations of RecA, there is enough disassembly occurring to prevent saturation of the DNA. As RecA concentrations are increased, the rate of nucleation and filament assembly increases, and the net occupation of DNA binding sites increases. The maximum rate observed, signaling saturation, was just over 30 μm min–1. In the presence of DinI, the rate of ATP hydrolysis reached the same maximum, but only a 1.5-fold excess of RecA is required. This indicates that the rate of RecA-mediated ATP hydrolysis is identical with or without DinI at the point of DNA saturation with RecA, suggesting that the intrinsic ATP hydrolytic activity of RecA is unaffected by DinI.

It also contains an unusually large exposed hydrophobic surface that is consistent with a membrane association surface and possibly the detergent/lipid requirement of the Δ2–75 deletion construct. The second β-sheet domain, domain II, is an insertion within domain I and appears to be mostly present in Gram-negative signal peptidases (16Paetzel M. Strynadka N.C.

Interestingly, the MeHpg is cross-linked via the ortho-carbon atom of its phenol ring to the ortho-carbon atom in the phenol ring of the Tyr residue forming a (3,3)-biaryl bridge. This cross-link creates a 3-residue ring-type structure within the peptide. Two of the backbone amide nitrogen atoms (MeSerN1 and MeHpgN16) are methylated. The first two residues have d-stereochemistry. The crystallographic and biophysical analysis of the mode of binding of this inhibitor in the substrate binding cleft of E. coli signal peptidase reveals the mechanism of inhibition for this non-covalently bound peptide-based inhibitor and also may give us important insights into the binding interactions involved in pre-protein binding and cleavage by type I signal peptidase.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—The SPase Δ2–75 protein (relative molecular mass (Mr) 27,952 by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis (13Kuo D.W.

The inhibitor arylomycin A2 was isolated from Streptomyces as described by Schimana et al. (29Schimana J. Gebhardt K. Holtzel A. Schmid D.G. Sussmuth R. Muller J. Pukall R. Fiedler H.P. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 2002; 55: 565-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).Co-crystallization and Data Collection—Arylomycin A2, dissolved in Me2SO and water, was added to the SPase Δ2–75 protein at a 1:1 mole ratio and allowed to sit on ice for >30 min and then stored at -20 °C. The crystals were grown by sitting drop vapor diffusion with a reservoir consisting of 0.5% Triton X-100, 15% PEG 4000, 20% propanol-1, and 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 6.0. The drop consisted of 1 μl of the protein-inhibitor mixture and 1 μl of the reservoir solution. The crystals belong to the tetragonal space group P43212 with unit cell dimensions of a = 69.6 Å, b = 69.6 Å, c = 258.5 Å. Given the unit cell dimensions and the molecular mass, the specific volume (Vm (30Matthews B.W. J. Mol.

Before data collection, the crystal was soaked in a cryosolution that consisted of the same conditions as the crystallization mother liquor with the addition of 20% glycerol. The x-ray diffraction intensities were measured at 100 K on beamline X8C at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS). The data were processed using DENZO and SCALE-PACK (31Otwinowski Z. Sawyer L. Isaacs N. Baily S. Denzo.

Chem. 2002; 277: 9512-9519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) is under accession code 1KN9.Fluorescence Spectroscopy of Ligand Binding—Steady-state fluorescence measurements were made using a PerkinElmer LS-50 spectrofluorimeter. Spectra were recorded between 250 and 300 nm for excitation and between 310 and 450 nm for emission. The protein concentration was between 1 and 10 mm and ligand was in excess. Both enzyme and ligand were in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Elugent™ detergent and all experiments were carried out at 25 °C.Stopped-flow Experiments under Conditions of Excess Substrate— The kinetics of arylomycin A2 binding to SPase were investigated by stopped-flow fluorescence and stopped-flow fluorescence anisotropy on a model SF-61 DX2 stopped-flow spectrometer from Hi-Tech. The excitation wavelengths in each case were set using a monochromator and the fluorescence emission was measured using a filter with a cut-off below 360 nm. For stopped-flow fluorescence measurements the excitation wavelength was set at 280 nm to excite the arylomycin A2 molecule through the tryptophans of the SPase enzyme, whereas for anisotropy measurements the excitation wavelength was set at 310 nm to excite the ligand directly. In all cases the stopped-flow fluorescence data used for analysis were the average of 5 kinetic runs obtained under the exact same conditions and concentrations.The rate of binding was measured under conditions of excess substrate, with the SPase concentration kept at 6.25 μm and the ligand concentration varied in the range 7.5–50 μm and under conditions of excess enzyme with the enzyme concentration again at 6.25 μm and the ligand concentration varied in the concentration range 0.05–5 μm. Both enzyme and ligand were in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Elugent™ detergent and all experiments were carried out at 25 °C. Stopped-flow data were fitted to a double exponential equation of the form,ΔF=ΔF1×(1−exp(k1×t))+ΔF2×(1−exp(−k2×t))+c(Eq. 1) where ΔF is the total change in fluorescence, ΔF1 and ΔF2 are the fluorescence changes associated with rate constants k1 and k2, k1 and k2 are first-order rate constants, and c is the offset.The observed rate of binding under conditions of excess substrate was then plotted against the ligand concentration and fitted to Equation 2,kobs=koff+kon⋅[L](Eq. 2) where kobs (s-1) is the observed first-order rate of binding, koff (s-1) is the first-order rate constant for dissociation, kon (m-1 s-1) is the second-order rate constant for association (28Barkocy-Gallagher G.A. Bassford Jr., P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1231-1238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and m is the concentration of free ligand.Differential Scanning Calorimetry—The thermal stability of signal peptidase under various conditions was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry using a Microcal VP-DSC (Microcal Inc.) microcalorimeter. Solutions of 12.5 μm SPase in 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, 1% Elugent™ detergent, with and without 100 μm arylomycin A2 were used as samples. All solutions were thoroughly degassed before use and the reference cell in each case was filled with an aliquot of buffer against which the protein solution had previously been dialyzed overnight. All samples were scanned from 30 to 70 °C, at a rate of 1 °C/min and data were baseline corrected, smoothed using a Savitsky-Golay 9 point smoothing algorithm, and analyzed using the Origin Scientific plotting software.Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Determination of the binding constant and full thermodynamic description of the interaction of SPase with arylomycin A2 was achieved by isothermal titration calorimetry using a Microcal. Arylomycin A2 was dissolved in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Elugent™ detergent, pH 7.4, to a concentration of 450 μm and 33 separate injections were made into 1.4 ml of 15 μm SPase in the sample cell during one calorimetric run. For each run the resulting isotherm allows the number of binding sites for the ligand on each molecule, the binding association constant, and the change in reaction enthalpy upon binding to be calculated.RESULTSA New Crystal Form of the Catalytic Domain of E. coli Type I Signal PeptidaseInitial attempts to soak the arylomycin A2 into pre-formed crystals of Δ2–75 were unsuccessful. Therefore new conditions were developed to co-crystallize the SPase Δ2–75 with the inhibitor. The crystals described here belong to the tetragonal crystallographic space group P43212 and gave ordered diffraction out to 2.5 Å. This constitutes the third space group in which Δ2–75 has been crystallized and the structure solved. The acyl-enzyme inhibitor complex crystals had the orthorhombic space group P21212 (11Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Strynadka N.C. Nature. 1998; 396: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) and the apo-enzyme crystals had the tetragonal space group P41212 (12Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Strynadka N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9512-9519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The arylomycin A2-SPase Δ2–75 complex crystals described here form in polyethylene glycol 4000 and propanol-1, which is significantly different from the previously described crystallization conditions that used ammonium dihydrogen phosphate as the precipitant (15Paetzel M. Chernaia M. Strynadka N. Tschantz W. Cao G. Dalbey R.E. James M.N. Proteins. 1995; 23: 122-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). As with the previously described conditions, the detergent Triton X-100 was essential for crystallization. Also similar to the previous conditions, the buffer sodium citrate was used but in these new crystallization conditions the pH of the reservoir solution was pH 6.0 rather than 4.85.Crystallographic Structure Solution of Signal Peptidase in Complex with Arylomycin A2A molecular replacement solution was found using the program AMORE (32Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19704) Google Scholar). Molecule A from the previously solved 1.9-Å inhibitor acyl-enzyme crystal structure (Protein Data Bank code 1B12 (11Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Strynadka N.C. Nature. 1998; 396: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar)) was used as the search model. The program EPMR was also successful in obtaining the same solution (45Kissinger C.R. Gehlhaar D.K. Fogel D.B. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). The initial Fo - Fc difference map revealed a large circular density with a tail consistent with the general shape of the inhibitor. A model of the inhibitor was built, along with the topology and parameter files needed for refinement, based on the structural and stereochemical analysis of arylomycin A2 by Höltzel et al. (46Holtzel A. Schmid D.G. Nicholson G.J. Stevanovic S. Schimana J. Gebhardt K. Fiedler H.P. Jung G. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 2002; 55: 571-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Cycles of refinement and manual rebuilding of the protein model and inhibitor model using programs CNS and XFIT, respectively, were able to produce a model with a good fit to the experimental electron density (r = 23.1, Rfree = 28.5).Analysis of Arylomycin A2 in the Signal Peptidase Substrate Binding SiteAn average of 481 Å2 of solvent accessible surface area on E. coli SPase is buried by arylomycin A2 bound in the a"
https://openalex.org/W1998884774,"The Arabidopsis AtPTR2 and fungal fPTR2 genes, which encode H+/dipeptide cotransporters, belong to two different subgroups of the peptide transporter (PTR) (NRT1) family. In this study, the kinetics, substrate specificity, stoichiometry, and voltage dependence of these two transporters expressed in Xenopus oocytes were investigated using the two-microelectrode voltage-clamp method. The results showed that: 1) although AtPTR2 belongs to the same PTR family subgroup as certain H+/nitrate cotransporters, neither AtPTR2 nor fPTR2 exhibited any nitrate transporting activity; 2) AtPTR2 and fPTR2 transported a wide spectrum of dipeptides with apparent affinity constants in the range of 30 μm to 3 mm, the affinity being dependent on the side chain structure of both the N- and C-terminal amino acids; 3) larger maximal currents (Imax) were evoked by positively charged dipeptides in AtPTR2- or fPTR2-injected oocytes; 4) a major difference between AtPTR2 and fPTR2 was that, whereas fPTR2 exhibited low Ala-Asp– transporting activity, AtPTR2 transported Ala-Asp– as efficiently as some of the positively charged dipeptides; 5) kinetic analysis suggested that both fPTR2 and AtPTR2 transported by a random binding, simultaneous transport mechanism. The results also showed that AtPTR2 and fPTR2 were quite distinct from PepT1 and PepT2, two well characterized animal PTR transporters in terms of order of binding of substrate and proton(s), pH sensitivity, and voltage dependence.

Although nitrate and peptides are quite different in chemical structure, nitrate transporters and peptide transporters show significant sequence homology and belong to the same family of peptide transporters (PTR) 1The abbreviations used are: PTR, peptide transporters; TM, transmembrane; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; IAA, indole acetic acid. (alternative name of this family is POT standing for proton-coupled oligopeptide transporters (1Paulsen I.T. Skurray R.A. Trends Biol. Sci. 1994; 19: 404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 2Stacey G. Koh S. Granger C. Becker J.M. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 257-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar)). The first member of the PTR family identified was the Arbidopsis nitrate transporter gene, CHL1 (AtNRT1) (3Tsay Y.-F. Schroeder J.I. Feldmann K.A. Crawford N.M. Cell. 1993; 72: 705-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). In 1994, 1 year after the identification of CHL1, several peptide transporter genes were independently isolated by functional cloning from rabbit (PepT1) (4Fei Y.-J. Kanai Y. Nussberger S.

Biol. 1994; 14: 104-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and the Gram-positive bacterium, Lactococcus lactis (DtpT) (8Hagting A. Kunji E.R. Leenhouts K. Poolman B. Konings W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11391-11399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These peptide transporters were found to share sequence similarity with CHL1, and were classified together with CHL1 to form the new transporter family, PTR, this name being preferred because the majority of members are peptide transporters. CHL1 and these peptide transporters then served as prototypes to search for homologs in other organisms or tissues. Today, more than 20 PTR family members with transport activities are known (9Herrera-Ruiz D. Knipp G. J. Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 92: 691-714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic analysis of the nitrate and peptide transporters of the PTR family indicates that they can be classified into four groups (Fig. 1). Group I contains transporters from bacteria, group II transporters from animals, group III transporters from fungi, and group IV transporters from higher plants and histidine/peptide transporters from mammals. The four groups also have different topologies (Fig. 1). All are predicted to have 12 transmembrane (TM) domains. Members of group I are compact, with only short hydrophilic loops between the TM domains, whereas the members of the other groups contain a long hydrophilic loop (∼100 amino acid long), which lies between TM domains 9 and 10 in group II, between TM domains 7 and 8 in group III, and between TM domains 6 and 7 in group IV. All members of groups I, II, and III are peptide transporters, whereas group IV consists of a mixture of peptide and nitrate transporters (Table I), which cannot be easily classified into two subgroups on the basis of sequence similarity. This raises the question whether nitrate transporters in this family can also transport peptides and whether the peptide transporters in this family can also transport nitrate. As addressed in our previous studies, the nitrate transporters AtNRT1:2 and Os-NRT1 do not transport peptides (10Huang N.-C. Liu K.-H. Lo H.-J. Tsay Y.-F. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1381-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 11Lin C.-M. Koh S. Stacey G. Yu S.-M. Lin T.-Y. Tsay Y.-F. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However, none of the peptide transporters in the PTR family have been tested for their ability to transport nitrate. In this study, we chose two peptide transporters, AtPTR2 (group IV) and fPTR2 (group III), to address this question.Table ISubstrate specificities of members of groups III and IV of the PTR familyGroupNameSubstrate(s) determined in Xenopus oocytesSubstrate(s) determined in yeastRef.IIIfPTR2Peptide13Steiner H.-Y.

Steiner H.-Y. Zhang L. Naider F. Stacey G. Becker J.M. Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In situ hybridization analysis showed that AtPTR2 is expressed in the embryo (12Rentsch D. Laloi M. Rouhara I. Schmelzer E. Delrot S. Frommer W.B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The peptide transporter gene fPTR2 (originally named AtPTR2A) was also isolated by functional complementation of a yeast peptide transport mutant using an Arabidopsis cDNA library (13Steiner H.-Y. Song W. Zhang L. Naider F. Becker J.M. Stacey G. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1289-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), but was later found not to be an Arabidopsis gene, but probably derived from a fungal contaminant (14Steiner H.-Y. Song W. Zhang L. Naider F. Becker J.M. Stacey G. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 2295Google Scholar). In this report, the substrate specificity and kinetic properties of AtPTR2 and fPTR2 were extensively examined by electrophysiological analysis of cRNA-injected Xenopus oocytes. The results revealed functional similarities and differences between peptide transporters in different groups of the PTR family. A mode of action of the two transporters is also proposed. Subcloning of AtPTR2 and fPTR2 cDNA into pGEMHE—To enhance the expression of AtPTR2 and fPTR2 in Xenopus oocytes, cDNA fragments were cloned into plasmid pGEMHE (15Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). The ∼2.0-kb NotI cDNA fragment of AtPTR2 or fPTR2 was excised from plasmids pDTF1 (6Song W. Steiner H.-Y. Zhang L. Naider F. Stacey G. Becker J.M. Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) or pDTF4 (13Steiner H.-Y. Song W. Zhang L. Naider F. Becker J.M. Stacey G. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1289-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), respectively, and cloned into pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to produce the restriction sites for the subsequent construction. For AtPTR2, the cDNA fragment containing 25 bp of the 5′ untranslated region, 1758 bp of the coding region, and 141 bp of the 3′ untranslated region were generated by digestion with EcoRI and XhaI (both in the multiple cloning site) and cloned into the EcoRI and XhaI sites of pGEMHE to give plasmid pGEMHE-AtPTR2. For fPTR2, the cDNA fragment containing 293 bp of the 5′ untranslated region, 1830 bp of the coding region, and 315 bp of the 3′ untranslated region was generated by digestion with EcoRI (in the cDNA) and XhoI (in the multiple cloning site), the XhoI end was converted into a blunt end by Klenow filling, and the insert cloned into XbaI-digested (followed by blunting with Klenow) and EcoRI-digested pGEMHE to give plasmid pGEMHE-fPTR2. Functional Expression of AtPTR2 or fPTR2 in Xenopus Oocytes—For in vitro transcription, pGEMHE-AtPTR2 were linearized with NheI, and plasmid pGEMHE-fPTR2 was linearized with SphI and blunted with Klenow. Capped cRNA was transcribed in vitro using mMESSAGE mMACHINE kits (Ambion, Austin, TX). Oocytes were isolated as described (16Cao Y. Anderova M. Crawford N.M. Schroeder J.I. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 961-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and defoliculated by incubation for 1 h in Ca2+-free ND-96 solution (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) (17Roche J.P. Treistman S.N. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4883-4890Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing 1 mg/ml collagenase A (Type II, Sigma). Defoliculated mature oocytes (stage IV–V) were selected, injected with 50 ng of cRNA, then incubated for 2 days at 18 °C for translation. Electrophysiological Measurements—Measurements were made in a solution containing 230 mm mannitol, 0.3 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm MES/Tris, pH 7.4, then perfused with 220 mm mannitol, 0.3 mm CaCl2, 10 mm MES/Tris at the pH indicated (pH 4.5–7.4 by mixing different ratios of MES and Tris), plus dipeptides, histidine, or HNO3. The oocytes were voltage-clamped at —60 mV with a TEV-200 two-electrode amplifier (Dagan, Minneapolis, MN). In the I/V relationship studies, the oocyte plasma membrane was held at —60 mV, then 300-ms pulses of step changes (0 mV (or —40 mV) to —160 mV in 20 mV decrements) in membrane potential were applied. The current evoked at the end of the 300-ms pulses was plotted against the membrane potential. Measurements were recorded using the AXOTAPE and pCLAMP6 programs (Axon Instruments, Inc., Foster City, CA). Kinetic Analysis—The currents elicited by different concentrations of peptides at each membrane potential (Vm) were fitted to the equation, I=ImaxS⋅[S]/([S]+KmS) by a nonlinear least squares method using Program Original 5.0 (Microcal Software, Northampton). I is the evoked current (i.e. the current difference in the presence and absence of substrate), [S] the peptide concentration, ImaxS the maximal current at a saturating concentration of peptide, and KmS is the peptide concentration at which the current is half-maximal. The currents elicited by dipeptide at different pH values were fitted to the equation, I=ImaxH⋅[H+]nH/([H+]nH+[KmH]nH) by a nonlinear least squares method using Program Original 5.0. [H+] is the proton concentration, ImaxH the maximal current elicited by a saturating proton concentration, KmH the proton concentration at which the current is half-maximal, and nH the Hill coefficient. AtPTR2 and fPTR2 Lack Nitrate Transport Activity—Oocytes injected with AtPTR2 or fPTR2 were voltage clamped at —60 mV, then perfused with 10 mm nitrate or dipeptide Gly-Gly at pH 5.5. As shown in Table II, AtPTR2-or fPTR2-injected oocytes responded to Gly-Gly with an inward current, but showed little or no current changes in response to nitrate, showing that AtPTR2 and fPTR2 transport peptide, but not nitrate. The Arabidopsis nitrate transporter, CHL1, was included for comparison and, consistent with our results for the Arabidopsis nitrate transporter, AtNRT1:2 (10Huang N.-C. Liu K.-H. Lo H.-J. Tsay Y.-F. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1381-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), and the rice nitrate transporter, OsNRT1 (11Lin C.-M. Koh S. Stacey G. Yu S.-M. Lin T.-Y. Tsay Y.-F. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), was found to transport nitrate, but not Gly-Gly (Table II).Table IIWhole cell current measurements of oocytes voltage-clamped at -60 mVInward currents (nA) elicited byXenopus oocytes injected withAtPTR2fPTR2CHL1WaterGly-Gly176.6 ± 101105.9 ± 68.20.0 ± 6.30.4 ± 3.0n = 7n = 18n = 7n = 10Nitrate-6.4 ± 11.13.9 ± 6.265.7 ± 28.55.2 ± 6.9n = 7n = 18n = 7n = 10Histidine13.5 ± 11.65.6 ± 4.0-0.1 ± 3.43.1 ± 1.9n = 7n = 7n = 3n = 4 Open table in a new tab In addition to nitrate and peptide, histidine can be transported by two group IV members. For example, using the Xenopus oocyte expression system, the Brassica transporter, Bn-NRT1;2, was shown to transport both nitrate and histidine (18Zhou J.-J. Theodoulou F.L. Muldin I. Ingemarsson B. Miller A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12017-12023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and the rat transporter PHT1 to transport both peptide and histidine (19Yamashita T. Shimada S.

As shown in Table II and Fig. 2, little or no current change was elicited by histidine in AtPTR2- or fPTR2-injected oocytes (Table II and Fig. 2). In AtPTR2- or fPTR2-injected oocytes, Gly-Gly evoked a current increase at hyperpolarizing membrane potentials, whereas nitrate or histidine evoked little or no current change at any membrane potential tested up to —160 mV (Fig. 2). Nitrate transporters in the PTR family are electrogenic (3Tsay Y.-F. Schroeder J.I. Feldmann K.A. Crawford N.M. Cell. 1993; 72: 705-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 10Huang N.-C. Liu K.-H. Lo H.-J. Tsay Y.-F.

Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 2183-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), the absence of current elicited by nitrate in AtPTR2- or fPTR2-injected oocytes is therefore indicative of no nitrate transport activity in AtPTR2 and fPTR2. To rule out the possibility that nitrate might be transported through AtPTR2 and fPTR2 in an electroneutral manner, effect of nitrate on peptide transport activity was determined. As shown in the Supplemental Materials (Fig. S1), the current elicited by Gly-Gly in the fPTR2-injected oocyte was not inhibited by the presence of nitrate. Taken together, these data indicate that, despite their sequence similarity, the nitrate transporter, CHL1, transports nitrate, but not peptide, whereas the peptide transporters, AtPTR2 and fPTR2, transport peptide, but not nitrate. Optimal Peptide Length for AtPTR2 and fPTR2—In AtPTR2- or fPTR2-injected oocytes, the current elicited by Gly-Gly-Gly was about 60% of that elicited by Gly-Gly, whereas that elicited by Gly or Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly was ≤10% of that elicited by Gly-Gly (all at 10 mm) (Fig. 3). This is consistent with the inhibitory effect of di- and tripeptides containing toxic amino acids on the growth of yeast transformed with AtPTR2 or fPTR2 (6Song W. Steiner H.-Y. Zhang L. Naider F. Stacey G. Becker J.M. Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 13Steiner H.-Y. Song W. Zhang L. Naider F. Becker J.M. Stacey G. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1289-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Thus, like PepT1 and PepT2 (4Fei Y.-J. Kanai Y. Nussberger S. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Romero M.F. Singh S.K. Boron W.F. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 563-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar), AtPTR2 and fPTR2 respond optimally to di- and tripeptides. Amino Acid Side Chain Specificity of AtPTR2 and fPTR2—To elucidate the amino acid side chain specificity of AtPTR2 and fPTR2, injected oocytes were voltage-clamped at —60 mV, then exposed to various dipeptides at different concentrations. The normalized Imax values calculated for the dipeptides tested are shown in Fig. 4 and the calculated affinities and permeabilities are shown in Table III. For both AtPTR2 and fPTR2, the Imax for positively charged peptides (Ala-His, His-Leu, Lys-Leu, and Ala-Lys) were larger than that for the other peptides tested. The major difference between AtPTR2 and fPTR2 was their response to the negatively charged dipeptide, Ala-Asp, which evoked relatively large currents in AtPTR2-injected oocytes, but smaller currents in fPTR2-injected oocytes (normalized Imax for Ala-Asp ∼500 and ∼150%, respectively, in AtPTR2- and fPTR2-injected oocytes, see Fig. 4).Table IIIComparison of kinetic parameters of AtPTR2 and fPTR2 for neutral and charged dipeptidesDipeptideKmRelative ImaxaThe relative Imax was determined as described in the legend to Fig. 5./KmAtPTR2fPTR2AtPTR2fPTR2μm% / μmLeu-Leu52 ± 13bKm and Imax calculated for two different oocytes.33 ± 5cKm and Imax calculated for three different oocytes.2.812.71Tyr-Leu87 ± 1bKm and Imax calculated for two different oocytes.378 ± 117cKm and Imax calculated for three different oocytes.1.420.24Lys+-Leu113dKm and Imax calculated for one oocyte.144 ± 33bKm and Imax calculated for two different oocytes.4.102.70Ala-Leu313 ± 132bKm and Imax calculated for two different oocytes.319 ± 56eKm and Imax calculated for more than three different oocytes.0.960.81His+-Leu474dKm and Imax calculated for one oocyte.44 ± 8bKm and Imax calculated for two different oocytes.1.606.62Gly-Leu523 ± 21bKm and Imax calculated for two different oocytes.256 ± 8bKm and Imax calculated for two different oocytes.0.461.02Ala-Phe309 ± 358bKm and Imax calculated for two different oocytes.600 ± 78bKm and Imax calculated for two different oocytes.0.510.31Ala-Leu313 ± 132bKm and Imax calculated for two different oocytes.319 ± 56eKm and Imax calculated for more than three different oocytes.0.960.81Ala-Lys+NDfND, not determined.354 ± 21bKm and Imax calculated for two different oocytes.ND0.82Ala-Gly421 ± 182bKm and Imax calculated for two different oocytes.583 ± 203bKm and Imax calculated for two different oocytes.0.710.25Ala-His+1354 ± 375bKm and Imax calculated for two different oocytes.2084 ± 487bKm and Imax calculated for two different oocytes.0.780.34Ala-Asp-1832 ± 513bKm and Imax calculated for two different oocytes.1455 ± 879bKm and Imax calculated for two different oocytes.0.270.10Gly-Gly1260 ± 314bKm and Imax calculated for two different oocytes.1648 ± 349bKm and Imax calculated for two different oocytes.0.190.17a The relative Imax was determined as described in the legend to Fig. 5.b Km and Imax calculated for two different oocytes.c Km and Imax calculated for three different oocytes.d Km and Imax calculated for one oocyte.e Km and Imax calculated for more than three different oocytes.f ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab As shown in Table III, the affinities of the dipeptides tested in AtPTR2- and fPTR2-injected oocyte were in the range of ∼30 μm to ∼2 mm. With the exception of His-Leu and Tyr-Leu, the affinities of the different dipeptides were quite similar for AtPTR2 and fPTR2, with Leu-Leu showing the highest affinity for both. The studies of L. lactis peptide transporter DtpT (21Fang G. Konings W.N. Poolman B. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2530-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and the rat kidney oligopeptide/H+ symporter (22Daniel H. Morse E. Adibi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9565-9573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that increasing hydrophobicity in both the N- and C-terminal side chains increases the affinity of a dipeptide substrate. However, in the cases of AtPTR2 and fPTR2, no such clear relationship was found. For example, when dipeptides with a fixed C terminus (Leu), the preferred residues in the N-terminal are in the order of LeuH > TyrP > Lys+ > AlaH > His+ > GlyP (H: hydrophobic, P: polar, +: positively charged) for AtPTR2 and LeuH > His+ > Lys+ > GlyP > AlaH > TyrP for fPTR2 (Table III). Similarly, when dipepdies with a fixed N-terminal (Ala), the preferred residues in the C-terminal are in the order of PheH > LeuH > GlyP > His+ > Asp— for AtPTR2 and LeuH > Lys+ > GlyP >PheH > Asp— > His+. Nevertheless, a common feature among AtPTR2, fPTR2, DtpT, and the rat kidney oligopeptide/H+ symporter is that dipeptides with Phe and Leu residues exhibited the highest affinity. Influence of the Membrane Potential on Substrate Affinity— The neutral, anionic, and cationic dipeptides, Ala-Gly, Ala-Asp, and Ala-His, were chosen to investigate the effect of voltage on the substrate affinity of fPTR2 and AtPTR2 at pH 5.5. Xenopus oocytes injected with either fPTR2 or AtPTR2 were voltage-clamped at —60 mV, then subjected to voltage pulses ranging from —40 to —160 mV for 300 ms in 20-mV decrements. As shown in Fig. 5, the apparent affinity constant (Km) of AtPTR2 and fPTR2 for the three dipeptides tested was relatively voltage-insensitive. At a hyperpolarizing Vm (—80 to —160 mV), the Km values of AtPTR2 and fPTR2 for all three dipeptides were voltage-independent, whereas at membrane potentials more positive than —80 mV, the Km values either remained voltage-insensitive (e.g. AtPTR2 for all three dipeptides and fPTR2 for Ala-Asp), or increased slightly (e.g. fPTR2 for Ala-Gly and Ala-His+). Stoichiometry—To estimate how many protons were transported with peptide in each transport cycle, injected oocytes were exposed to 2 mm peptide at different pH values. As shown in Fig. 6, for fPTR2, the apparent coupling coefficient, n, for proton(s) calculated at various membrane potentials, was close to 1 for both Ala-Asp and Ala-Gly. In the case of AtPTR2, n was close to 1 for the neutral dipeptide Ala-Gly, but close to 2 for the negatively charged dipeptide Ala-Asp. Kinetics of Ala-His Transport—Of the dipeptides tested, Ala-His elicited the largest current in both fPTR2- and AtPTR2-injected oocytes (Fig. 4) and was therefore used to investigate the kinetics of AtPTR2 and fPTR2. As shown in Figs. 7, A and C, the maximal current induced by protons (ImaxH+) exhibited a supralinear dependence on voltage and increased as the [Ala-His]0 increased. Similarly, as shown in Fig. 7, B and D, at a hyperpolarizing Vm (less than —60 mV for AtPTR2-injected oocytes and less than —20 mV for fPTR2-injected oocytes), the maximal current induced by Ala-His (ImaxAla-His) increased as the proton concentration increased, but, at depolarizing potentials (—60 to 0 mV for AtPTR2-injected oocytes and —20 to 0 mV for fPTR2-injected oocytes), the ImaxAla-His remained the same when the proton concentration was increased from 1 μm, pH 6, to 10 μm, pH 5. The affinity for protons (KmH) was relatively voltage-independent at 2 and 0.5 mm Ala-His (Fig. 8, A and C). The affinity for Ala-His (KmAla-His) was also voltage-independent at 10 μm H+ (Fig. 8, B and D), but voltage-dependent at 1 μm H+. The KHm increased when the Ala-His concentration was decreased from 2 to 0.5 mm, and the KmAla-His also increased when the proton concentration was decreased from 10 to 1 μm. KmH and KmAla-His shown in Fig. 8 were calculated according to the total amount of Ala-His added. Because pK of the histidine side chain is about 6.0, the ratio of [Ala-His0]/[Ala-His+] will be about 0.1 at pH 5, and 1 at pH 6. Taking this into consideration, the calculated KmAla-His+ or KmAla-His0 will still increase when pH increases from pH 5 to 6 (Supplemental Materials Table S1). Similarly, the KmH, recalculated if AtPTR2 transports the neutral form of Ala-His, will still increase when the peptide concentration increases from 0.5 to 2 mm. And, when the peptide concentration increases from 0.5 to 2 mm, KmH, recalculated if AtPTR2 transports positively charged Ala-His+, will remain the same at —160 to —120 mV and increase at —100 to —60 mV. Therefore, overall, regardless of which form of Ala-His was transported by these two transporters, the affinity for proton and Ala-His depended on the concentration of their respective co-substrates. We previously showed that nitrate transporters in the PTR family lacked peptide transport activity. Several peptide transporters in the PTR family have been identified from a wide range of organisms, including bacteria, fungi, animals, and plants. However, none of these peptide transporters have been tested for possible nitrate transport activity. In this study, two peptide transporters were shown to have no nitrate uptake activity. Together with our previous studies on nitrate transporters (10Huang N.-C. Liu K.-H. Lo H.-J. Tsay Y.-F. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1381-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 11Lin C.-M. Koh S. Stacey G. Yu S.-M. Lin T.-Y. Tsay Y.-F. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), it appears that that PTR family peptide transporters and nitrate transporters are two distinct transporter subtypes. Even though peptide transporters and nitrate transporters in the PTR family are functionally distinct, they cannot be easily classified into two groups on the basis of sequence similarity. In the Arabidopsis genome, there are 53 transporter genes predicted to belong to the PTR family (23Arabidosis Nature. 2000; 408: 796-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (7164) Google Scholar). Thus, because only 6 PTR members are found in the human genome, 4 in the Caenorhabditis elegans genome, 3 in the Drosophila genome, and 2 in the yeast genome, plants seem to have evolved high copy numbers of PTR transporters. This has led to the speculation that: 1) plants might use peptide hormones (23Arabidosis Nature. 2000; 408: 796-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (7164) Google Scholar), or 2) PTR transporters might be able to transport substrates other than peptides or nitrate. One interesting potential substrate is indole acetic acid (IAA)-amino acid conjugates. IAA is an important plant growth hormone and 95% of the IAA pool is sequestered in an inactivated conjugated form, e.g. the amino acid-conjugated form. However, in AtPTR2- and fPTR2-injected oocytes, IAA-Ala, IAA-Leu, or IAA-Phe did not induce any current changes (data not shown). It remains to be determined whether other Arabidopsis PTR members have IAA-amino acid conjugate transporting activity. Fig. 8 shows that the KmH decreased at all membrane potentials when the Ala-His concentration was increased and that the KmAla-His decreased when the proton concentration was increased. This increase in the apparent affinity of the transporter for proton and Ala-His as the concentration of their respective co-substrate increased suggests positive cooperativity between the two ligands for binding to their respective sites on the transporter. This suggests that both ligands bind to the transporter before being transported across the membrane, i.e. that the transporter operates via a simultaneous transport mechanism instead of a sequential transport mechanism (Fig. 9). The ImaxH+ increased as the [Ala-His]o increased at all membrane potentials (Fig. 7, A and C) and the ImaxAla-His increased as the [H+]o increased at hyperpolarizing potentials (more negative than —20 mV for fPTR2 and —60 mV for AtPTR2) (Fig. 7, B and D). This means that, at hyperpolarizing potentials, the Imax values for both H+ and Ala-His were dependent on the concentration of their respective co-substrate, suggesting that AtPTR2 and fPTR2 operate by a random-binding transport model (Fig. 9). However, at depolarizing potentials (greater than —20 mV for fPTR2 and greater than —60 mV for AtPTR2), AtPTR2 and fPTR2 function through an ordered binding mode in which H+ binds first (heavier arrows in Fig. 9). Because the membrane potentials of plant cells are usually more negative than —60 mV, our data suggest that, in the physiological range of membrane potentials, AtPTR2 and fPTR2 transport proton and dipeptide via a random binding, simultaneous transport model. In terms of structure, the Arabidopsis peptide transporter, AtPTR2, and the “fungal” peptide transporter, fPTR2, differ in having a long hydrophilic loop between TM domains 7–8 and 6–7, respectively (Fig. 1). In this study, most of the functional properties involved in the transport of neutral and positively charged dipeptides were quite similar between these two transporters. However, the two transporters differed in terms of the transport of the negatively charged peptide, Ala-Asp. First, Ala-Asp elicited a large current in AtPTR2-injected oocytes, but only a small current in fPTR1-injected oocytes (Fig. 4); this was unique to the negatively charged Ala-Asp, because positively charged and neutral dipeptides had a similar relative Imax in AtPTR2 or fPTR2-injected oocytes. Second, the apparent coupling coefficient, n, for H+ is ∼2 for AtPTR2 and ∼1 for fPTR2 (Fig. 5), but further experiments are needed to clearly define the stoichiometry. The two best characterized peptide transporter members of the PTR family, PepT1 and PepT2, are animal transporters and belong to group II. AtPTR2 and fPTR2 belong to a different group (groups IV and III, respectively, Fig. 1). Our study showed that, in terms of their functional properties, AtPTR2 and fPTR2 were quite similar to each other, but distinct from the animal peptide transporters, PepT1 and PepT2, in several aspects, as described below. Random Binding Versus Ordered Binding—All four transporters transport dipeptide and proton by a simultaneous transport mode. However, PepT1 and PepT2 use an ordered binding mechanism in which the proton binds first (24Mackenzie B. Loo D.D.F. Fei Y.-J. Liu W. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Wright E.M. J. Biol.

Voltage Sensitivity of the Dipeptide Affinity—Several studies of PepT1 and PepT2 have shown that their apparent affinities for dipeptides, particularly charged dipeptides, are strongly voltage-dependent, decreasing about 10–30-fold when the membrane is hyperpolarized from —50 to —160 mV (24Mackenzie B.

However, our present study of AtPTR2 and fPTR2 showed that their affinities were more or less voltage-insensitive or slightly increased (not decreased) on hyperpolarization from —50 to —160 mV (Figs. 5 and 8). Lack of Inhibition at a Low pH—Several studies (24Mackenzie B. Loo D.D.F. Fei Y.-J. Liu W. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Wright E.M. J. Biol.

In contrast, our data showed that, for both AtPTR2 and fPTR2, the current evoked, even at —160 mV, did not decline with increasing proton concentration (see Supplemental Materials Fig. S2). Lack of a Hyperpolarization Inactivation Effect—Hyperpolarization inhibits the transport of PepT1 and PepT2, and this effect is enhanced by a low pH and a low substrate concentration (24Mackenzie B.

However, our data showed that, under similar conditions, no hyperpolarization-mediated inhibition was seen with AtPTR2- or fPTR2-injected oocytes (Fig. 2 and Supplemental Materials Fig. S3). In contrast to animal cells, in which the Vm is about —50 mV, the membrane potential of a plant cell is about —120 mV and sometimes as low as —200 mV. In addition, because of the presence of H+-ATPase on the plasma membrane, the external pH of a plant cell is maintained at around pH 5.5. This suggests that the lack of low pH and hyperpolarization inactivation in plant peptide transporters might have evolved to ensure that they can function under physiological conditions. As shown in Fig. 1, the major structural differences between groups II (animal group), III (fungal group), and IV (plant group) are their long hydrophilic loops, which may be responsible for the observed functional differences.

Here we analyzed the patterns of p16INK4a and Id1 expression during the lifespan of 2BS cells and presented the inverse correlation between these two proteins. Immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated the presence of endogenous interaction of Id1 and E47 proteins that was strong in young 2BS cells and weakened during replicative senescence and, thereby, influenced the transcription activation of p16INK4a by E47. Furthermore, we found that E47 protein could bind to the E-box-containing region in p16INK4a promoter in senescent cells by chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses, suggesting that E47 is indeed ultimately involved in the regulation of p16INK4a transcription in vivo. Silencing Id1 expression in young cells by RNA interference induced an increased p16INK4a level and premature cellular senescence, whereas silencing E47 expression inhibited the expression of p16INK4a and delayed the onset of senescent phenotype. The present study demonstrated not only the capacity of Id1 to regulate p16INK4a gene expression by E47, but also the phenotypic consequence of the regulation on cellular senescence, moreover, raised the possibility of Id1-specific gene silencing for human cancer therapy.

They have been shown to play important roles in cell differentiation, lineage commitment, and the expression of many tissue-specific genes. The family of proteins generally contains an HLH domain that primarily mediates homo- or heterodimerization with tissue-restricted HLH proteins, e.g. MyoD (skeletal muscle) or NeuroD (neurons), to regulate cell-specific gene transcription. An adjacent domain that is rich in basic amino acids mediates the binding to DNA when these proteins dimerize (6Voronova A. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4722-4726Google Scholar). Both homodimers and heterodimers have been shown to bind to the consensus DNA sequence CANNTG, referred to as the E-box, and to activate gene transcription. It has been shown that E47 binds to DNA both as a heterodimer and as a homodimer (7Sun X.H. Baltimore D. Cell. 1991; 64: 459-470Google Scholar, 8Shen C.P. Kadesch T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4518-4524Google Scholar), whereas E12 binds to DNA efficiently only as heterodimer, for an inhibitory domain N-terminal to the basic region of E12 prevents E12 homodimers from binding to DNA (7Sun X.H. Baltimore D. Cell. 1991; 64: 459-470Google Scholar). The E12 and E47 proteins are two products of the E2A gene (7Sun X.H. Baltimore D. Cell. 1991; 64: 459-470Google Scholar), and they differ only by differential utilization of two alternative exons in E2A. The Id family is another category of HLH protein that contains a highly conserved HLH domain but lacks the basic region necessary for DNA binding. So, members of this family can heterodimerize with basic HLH proteins and result in a form that is unable to bind to DNA, hence they function as dominant negative regulators to inhibit the transcriptional activation mediated by E proteins (9Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Google Scholar, 10Garrell J. Modolell J. Cell. 1990; 61: 39-48Google Scholar, 11Ellis H.M. Spann D.R. Posakony J.W. Cell. 1990; 61: 27-38Google Scholar). The term “Id” is conveniently taken to reflect the ability of these proteins to inhibit both DNA binding and differentiation. There are four members of the Id family in mammals, Id1 through Id4 (9Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Google Scholar, 12Sun X.H. Copeland N.G.

Generally, proliferating cells express multiple Id genes, whereas upon differentiation in many cell types, the expression of Id genes is down-regulated (9Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Google Scholar, 12Sun X.H. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5603-5611Google Scholar, 19Kreider B. Benezra R. Rovera G. Kadesch T.

Peverali F.A. Philipson L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4985-4988Google Scholar). In addition, abolishing Id proteins synthesis by antisense oligonucleotides blocks the quiescent fibroblasts into the cell cycle (22Hara E. Yamaguchi T. Nojima H. Ide T. Campisi J. Okayama H. Oda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2139-2145Google Scholar, 23Barone M.V. Pepperkok R. Peverali F.A. Philipson L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4985-4988Google Scholar). These facts suggest that Id proteins play a role in the regulation of the cell cycle. It has been shown that Id1 and Id2 inhibited DNA binding by E47 very efficiently (9Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Google Scholar, 12Sun X.H. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5603-5611Google Scholar). E2A-encoded proteins (E12 and E47) have the ability to block cells in G1 phase through the transcriptional activation of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p21 expression (24Peverali F.A. Ramqvist T. Saffrich R. Pepperkok R. Barone M.V. Philipson L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4291-4301Google Scholar, 25Prabhu S. Ignatova A. Park S.T. Sun X.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5888-5896Google Scholar). Id1 is able to inhibit E2A-mediated expression of the p21 gene. Overexpression of E2A in 293T cells activates expression of the endogenous p21 gene at both the levels of mRNA and protein (25Prabhu S. Ignatova A. Park S.T. Sun X.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5888-5896Google Scholar). Enforced expression of E proteins suppresses the cell colony-forming efficiency of several cell lines. Moreover, they activate transcription of p21CIP1/WAF1, p15INK4b, and p16INK4a promoters, which contain E-boxes (26Pagliuca A. Gallo P. De Luca P. Lania L. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1376-1382Google Scholar). Taken together, E proteins may inhibit cell proliferation through the transcriptional activation of CDK inhibitor genes. Id1 is implicated in the modulation of cell senescence and immortalization (27Alani R.M. Hasskarl J. Grace M. Hernandez M.C. Israel M.A. Munger K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9637-9641Google Scholar, 28Nickoloff B.J. Chaturvedi V. Bacon P. Qin J.Z. Denning M.F. Diaz M.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27501-27504Google Scholar). Overexpression of Id1 extends the replicative lifespan of the primary human keratinocytes or immortalizes them. A recent report (29Alani R.M. Young A.Z. Shifflett C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7812-7816Google Scholar) indicates that Id1-null mouse embryo fibroblasts undergo premature senescence and express high levels of p16INK4a. These data imply that Id1 could delay cellular senescence through regulation of p16INK4a expression. p16INK4a is an important tumor suppressor that is inactivated in a large proportion of human tumors (30Ruas M. Peters G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: F115-F177Google Scholar). p16INK4a elicits its cellular effects by inhibiting CDK4 and CDK6, which regulate cell cycle progression in G1 phase by contributing to the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein (31Hara E. Smith R. Parry D. Tahara H. Stone S. Peters G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 859-867Google Scholar). Despite the significant function of it in cell senescence, immortalization, and tumorigenesis, the transcriptional control of p16INK4a is poorly understood at the present time but is thought to concern diverse nuclear factors. Understanding the mechanisms of p16INK4a regulation may help us to find a way of controlling its expression and inducing senescence in cancer. Here we take Id1 as a model to explore how the Id proteins are involved in the regulation of p16 expression and cellular senescence. We report here that Id1 inhibits p16INK4a expression by sequestering E47 protein and blocking the transcriptional activation of p16INK4a and, therefore, maintains the proliferation state of young 2BS cells. The reducing Id1 expression may be at least in part one of the causes of the enhancing p16INK4a level in senescent 2BS cells, which in turn contribute to the onset of cellular senescence. Our results provide valuable new insights into the mechanisms of p16INK4a control and cellular senescence. Cell Culture and Synchronization—Human embryonic lung diploid fibroblast 2BS cells (obtained from the National Institute of Biological Products, Beijing, China) were previously isolated from female fetal lung fibroblast tissue and have been fully characterized (32Tang Z. Zhang Z. Zheng Y. Corbley M.J. Tong T. Mech. Aging Dev. 1994; 73: 57-67Google Scholar, 33Li J. Zhang Z. Tong T. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1995; 80: 25-34Google Scholar, 34Duan J. Zhang Z. Tong T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48325-48331Google Scholar, 35Wang W. Wu J. Zhang Z. Tong T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48655-48661Google Scholar). The current expected life span is ∼70 population doublings (PDs). 2BS cells are considered to be young at PD30 or below and to be fully senescent at PD55 or above. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. For synchronization, 2BS cells were rendered quiescent by serum deprivation for 48 h and then stimulated to re-enter the cell cycle by the addition of serum to a final concentration of 10%. G1 phase cells were harvested at 8 h after serum stimulation. Western Blotting—Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1× PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 kallikrein-inactivating units/ml aprotinin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). Protein concentration of each sample was determined by BCA Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce). 60–100 μg of proteins was electrophoresed on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride filters (Millipore). The filter was blocked and then incubated with the primary antibody in 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) overnight at 4 °C. After washing, the blots were incubated with secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase at 1:40,000 in TBST for 1 h at room temperature. Proteins were visualized with Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Antibodies against p16 (SC-9968), Id1 (SC-488), Id2 (SC-489), Id3 (SC-490), Id4 (SC-491), E12 (SC-762), E47 (SC-763), and HEB (SC-357) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and used at 1 μg/ml concentration. Immunoprecipitation—Total proteins of young (PD26), middle-aged (PD42), and senescent (PD60) cells were precleared by incubation with 10 μl of rabbit immunoglobulin (Ig) and 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Pierce) for 30 min at 4 °C with agitation. For each immunoprecipitation reaction, 500 μl of cleared lysate was incubated with 5 μl of polyclonal anti-Id1 antiserum (SC-488) or 5 μl of Ig and rocked overnight at 4 °C, after which 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads was added and the incubation continued for an additional 1 h. The immune complexes were pelleted by centrifugation, washed five times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and finally resuspended and boiled for 5 min in SDS sample buffer. The released proteins were examined by Western blotting with anti-Id1 or anti-E47 antisera. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—ChIPs were performed using the Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay kit (Upstate, New York, NY) according to manufacturer's instruction. In brief, 1 × 106 cells were cross-linked by adding formaldehyde directly to cell culture media and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS, and then cells were scraped and resuspended in 200 μl of SDS lysis buffer. Chromatin was then sonicated to an average length of 0.5 kb for three 30-s pulses at maximum power. Chromatin extracts were diluted 10-fold in dilution buffer and preincubated for 30 min at 4 °C with 80 μl of Salmon Sperm DNA/protein A-agarose. Twenty microliters of diluted supernatant was kept for isolation of input DNA and to quantitate the DNA in different samples. After pelleting agarose by brief centrifugation, 2 μg of anti-E47 antiserum (test group) or 2 μgof β-actin antibody (irrelevant antibody control) was added to the supernatant fraction and incubated overnight at 4 °C with rotation. In addition, we performed a no-antibody immunoprecipitation by incubating the supernatant fraction with Salmon Sperm DNA/protein A-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C. Then 60 μl of Salmon Sperm DNA/protein A-agarose was added, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C to collect the antibody/antigen-DNA complex. The chromatin bound to the protein A-agarose beads was eluted in 500 μl of freshly prepared elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3). After reversing cross-linking, the samples were deproteinized and phenol-chloroform-extracted, and then DNA was ethanol-precipitated using glycogen as a carrier. Pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) for PCR analysis. Each PCR reaction mixture contained 5 μl of immunoprecipitated chromatin in a final reaction volume of 20 μl. PCR mixtures were amplified for 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 54 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. To amplify E-box-containing regions of p16INK4a promoter, the sequences of the primers used were as follows: E1s, 5′-AGGAATCCTTTGAACTAGGG-3′; E1a, 5′-GGGAAAGTATGGCTTCTTCT-3′; E2s, 5′-GAGTGAACGCACTCAAACAC-3′; and E2a, 5′-ATGTGGCACCCCTGAAGT-3′. All primers were synthesized at AuGCT Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). Small Interfering RNAs Preparation and Transfections—siRNAs corresponding to Id1 and E47 mRNAs were designed according to the pSilencer neo instruction manual (Ambion). In brief, the 21-nucleotide potential sequences in the target mRNAs that begin with an AA dinucleotide were found and compared with the human genome data base using BLAST (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST). Any target sequences with more than 16 or 17 contiguous base pairs of homology to other coding sequences were eliminated from consideration. The hairpin siRNA template oligonucleotides were designed by using a web-based insert design tool (www.ambion.com/techlib/misc/psilencer_converter.html) and chemically synthesized, with 5′-phosphate, 3′-hydroxyl, and two base overhangs on each strand. The following gene-specific sequences were used successfully: Id1, 5′-AACTCGGAATCCGAAGTTGGA-3′; E47, 5′-AAAGACCTGAGGGACCGGGAG-3′. Then the siRNAs were inserted into the BamHI and HindIII sites of pSilencer 2.1-U6 neo vector (Ambion) and referred to as pSilencer-Id1 and pSilencer-E47. They were transfected by LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) into 4 × 105 early passage 2BS cells (PD26) in 80–90% confluence. pSilencer NC vector (negative control of the pSilencer 2.1-U6 neo vector that expresses a hairpin siRNA with limited homology to any known sequences in the human, mouse, and rat genomes) was also transfected as a control. Stable transformants were obtained by sustained selection of G418 (Invitrogen). Cell Cycle Analysis—siRNA-transfected cells and untransfected young, middle-aged, and senescent 2BS cells were detached with 0.25% trypsin, and fixed with 75% ethanol overnight. After treated with 100 mg/ml RNase A (Sigma) at 37 °C for 30 min, cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS and stained with propidium iodide in the dark for 30 min, and the DNA contents were measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorting on a FACScan flow cytometry system (BD Biosciences). Cell cycle distributions were analyzed using CellFiT software (36Spector D.L. Goldman R.D. Leinwand L.A. Cell: A Laboratory Manual, Vol 1: Culture and Biochemical Analysis of Cells. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998Google Scholar). Senescence-associated β-Galactosidase Staining—siRNA-transfected cells and untransfected young, middle-aged, and senescent 2BS cells were washed twice in PBS, fixed to plates using 3% formaldehyde for 3–5 min, and washed with PBS again. Then cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C without CO2 in a freshly prepared staining buffer (1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal), 40 mm citric acid/sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 5 mm potassium ferricyanide, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2) (37Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubelj I. Pereira-Smith O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9363-9367Google Scholar). Growth Curve—siRNA-transfected cells and untransfected young, middle-aged, and senescent 2BS cells were detached and seeded into 96-well plates 2000 cells per well. At the indicated times, cells were stained with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (10 μg/ml in PBS; Sigma) for 3 h, then dissolved with 50% N,N-dimethylformamide and 10% SDS for 3h at 37 °C. The optical density at 570 nm was determined. Each point was determined in triplicate, and each curve was performed twice. Id1 Expression Inversely Correlated with p16INK4a Expression during the Lifespan of 2BS Cells—Due to the potential role of Id1 and E47 in the modulation of p16INK4a expression, their expression patterns during the progression of successive passages are of interest. Western blot analysis was performed on the 2BS cells cultured to PD26 (young), PD42 (middle-aged), and PD60 (senescent), respectively. To exclude the discrepancy of expression levels due to different stages of the cell cycle, cells were synchronized to G1 phase by serum starvation and harvested at 8 h after serum addition. Then endogenous expression of Id1, E47, and p16INK4a were measured. The results of Id1 in various ages of 2BS cells revealed a high Id1 protein level in young cells compared with the relatively low Id1 level in cells undergoing spontaneous replicative senescence (Fig. 1). As expected, middle-aged and young 2BS cells possessed low p16INK4a levels (Fig. 1). However, there was an increase in the p16INK4a level in senescent cells. There was either no change, or minimal change, in the levels of either E47 or β-actin (Fig. 1). These data indicated that young 2BS cells expressed high levels of Id1, however, Id1 expression declined accompanied by an improving level of p16INK4a and the onset of cellular senescence. In these cells, Id1 expression reduced during the lifespan of 2BS cells and inversely correlated with p16INK4a, which gave the opportunity for Id1 to adjust p16INK4a expression by changing itself. The stable level of E47 suggests it would not be a variable in the regulation of p16INK4a expression, but the data did not rule out the possibility that Id1 could repress p16INK4a expression by sequestering E47 and antagonize its function of transcriptional activation. Id1 and E47 Interact with Each Other in Young 2BS Cells Stronger Than in Senescent Cells—To discover the probable mechanism by which Id1 can affect p16INK4a expression in 2BS cells, the endogenous protein-protein interaction of Id1 and E47 was determined. Total proteins from young (PD26), middle-aged (PD42), and senescent (PD60) 2BS cells were prepared as aforementioned. The proteins were immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal anti-Id1 antiserum or with normal rabbit immunoglobulin (Ig) as a negative control. Crude cell extract from 2BS cells (PD 26) was run in a parallel lane. Immunodetection was done with polyclonal anti-E47 or anti-Id1 antiserum, as indicated (Fig. 2). The data showed that Id1 functionally interacted with E47, and the strength of binding was diminished with cellular senescence. Evidently, the binding of Id1 to E47 in young 2BS cells was the strongest, second only was that in middle-aged cells, and the combination potential was the weakest in senescent cells, corresponding to the low expression of Id1. As mentioned above, the E47 levels kept constant in young, middle-aged, and old cells, so the more E47 bound to Id1, the less E47 were free to activate transcription of target genes, for example, p16INK4a. Interestingly, the level of p16INK4a was induced in senescent 2BS cells where the binding strength of E47 to Id1 was weak and the E47 proteins had much more possibilities to function as transcriptional regulators. These data demonstrated the existence of a physical interaction between Id1 and E47 in vivo and established the relationship between amounts of free E47 and p16INK4a expression levels. It was conceivable that p16INK4a might be induced at least partly by the E47 protein which couldn't bind to Id1 in senescent cells. E47 Bound to E-Box containing Region of the Endogenous p16INK4a Promoter—Two E-boxes have been identified in the p16INK4a promoter sequence, which locate, respectively, at positions –354 (E1) and –620 (E2) relative to the translation initiation site (31Hara E. Smith R. Parry D. Tahara H. Stone S. Peters G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 859-867Google Scholar). To seek evidence that E47 can bind to and influence the endogenous p16INK4a promoter, ChIP assays were performed to detect the occupancy of E47 in the two E-boxes in the p16INK4a promoter. The chromatin was isolated in young (PD26) and senescent (PD60) 2BS cells and broken into small fragments via sonication after formaldehyde treatment of the cell cultures (Fig. 3C). An antibody specific for E47 was used to immunoprecipitate E47-cross-linked chromatin fragments. Following reversal of the cross-links and purification of the genomic DNA fragments, the DNA sequences were analyzed by PCR with specific pairs of primers flanking the E1 or E2 boxes (Fig. 3A). The binding of E47 was observed to both E1 and E2 boxes in senescent cells, compared with a weak amplification in young cells (Fig. 3B). The irrelevant antibody control (β-actin) and no antibody control had no amplification products, which suggested the binding of E47 to E1 and E2 boxes was specific. These results identified the binding of E47 to p16INK4a promoter in vivo and implicated the role of E47 in p16INK4a transcriptional regulation. Silencing of the Id1 Gene by RNA Interference (RNAi) Induced p16INK4a Expression and Premature Senescence, Whereas Silencing of the E47 Gene Inhibited p16INK4a Expression and Extended the Lifespan of 2BS Cells—Normal human diploid fibroblast 2BS cells enter a senescence state at about PD55–60. To determine the effects of Id1 and E47 expression levels on cellular senescence, we used the pSilencer vector system to stably suppress the expression of Id1 or E47 genes. Early passage of 2BS cells (PD26) were transfected with the pSilencer-Id1 (siId1), pSilencer-E47 (siE47), or pSilencer NC vector, and transformants were selected with G418. The siRNA-transfected cells were analyzed for the relative senescence markers compared with the untransfected 2BS cell control, all of which came from the same batch of early passage cells. The Efficiency and Specificity of Id1- or E47-specific RNAi and the Impact on p16INK4a Expression—To ensure the specificity of Id1 and E47 siRNA, we compared their potential sequences with the human genome data base using BLAST, and eliminated the sequences with more than 16–17 bp of homology to other coding sequences. We compared the mRNA sequences of the Id family, from Id1 through Id4, at the target domain of siId1 and the surrounding region, and discovered that the target sequence of siId1 had 11 bp of homology to Id2 mRNA, 9 bp of homology to Id3 mRNA, and 7 bp of homology to Id4 mRNA (Fig. 4A), which were all lower than 16–17 bp. Simultaneously, the sequences comparison of E proteins indicated that the target sequence of siE47 had 13 bp of homology to E12 mRNA and 11 bp of homology to E2-2 and HEB mRNAs (Fig. 5A). Hence the used sequences of siId1 and siE47 had less homology to the related proteins, which aided to avoid the impact on the expression of these proteins.Fig. 5Efficiency and specificity of E47 specific RNAi and the inhibition of endogenous p16 expression. A, comparison of the mRNA sequences of E47, E12, E2-2, and HEB at the target domain of siE47 and the surrounding region. B, Western blot analysis of E47, E12, E2-2, HEB, and p16 expression in siE47-transfected cells compared with NC cells. As the lifespan of siE47-transfected cells was prolonged, the cells at PD42–45 (M) and PD65–70 (S) were both used to detect the stable knockdown of E47 expression during extended cell growth. NC cells were used at the same PDs. Western blotting was performed using specific antibodies against E47, E12, E2-2, HEB, and p16 as indicated. C, ratios of E47, E12, E2-2, HEB, and p16 message to the β-actin message. The intensity of bands in B was determined by densitometric scanning.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To further determine the specificity and efficiency of siId1 and siE47, we detected the expression of related proteins in siId1 and siE47 transfected cells by Western blotting. Because the siId1 cells ceased cell division at PD42–45 (Table I), these pools of resistant clones to G418 were used (Fig. 4B). While the lifespan of siE47-transfected cells was prolonged (Table I), the cells both at PD42–45 and PD65–70 were used to detect the stable knockdown of E47 expression during extended cell growth (Fig. 5B). NC cells were used at same PDs. We found that in siId1-transfected cells the Id1 level reduced 75% compared with the NC cells (Fig. 4, B and C), establishing the efficiency of the Id1 si"
https://openalex.org/W2057736836,"Hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF) is a heparin-binding proliferating factor originally isolated from conditioned medium of the hepatoma-derived cell line HuH-7. HDGF has greatest homology in an amino acid sequence with high mobility group 1 (HMG1), which has been characterized as a DNA-binding, inflammatory, and potent neurite outgrowth molecule. HDGF is reported to be widely expressed and act as a growth factor in many kinds of cells. However, it has not been investigated in the nervous system. Here, we show by Western blot analysis that HDGF is present in the mouse brain from the embryonic period until adulthood. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analyses revealed that HDGF was expressed mainly in neurons, and HDGF protein was localized to the nucleus. HDGF and high mobility group 1 were secreted under physiological conditions and released extracellularly in necrotic conditions. Furthermore, we showed that exogenously supplied HDGF had a neurotrophic effect and was able to partially prevent the cell death of neurons in which endogenous HDGF was suppressed. Therefore, we propose that HDGF is a novel type of neurotrophic factor, on account of its localization in the nucleus and its potential to function in an autocrine manner under both physiological and pathological conditions throughout life.

HDGF represents a new family of growth factors called HDGF-related proteins (HRPs), which includes HRP1, HRP2, HRP3, HRP4, and lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF)/p75/p52 (2Izumoto Y.

LEDGF/p75/p52 has been characterized as a coactivator of both transcription and pre-mRNA splicing (7Ge H. Si Y. Roeder R.G.

All of these factors have in common the following features: 1) homology in the N-terminal 98 amino acids, 2) bipartite nuclear localization signals, and 3) absence of signal peptide. Recent studies showed that HDGF is widely expressed. Exogenously supplied HDGF stimulates the growth of fibroblasts (1Nakamura H. Izumoto Y. Kambe H. Kuroda T. Mori T. Kawamura K. Yamamoto H.

Hepatogastroenterology. 2002; 49: 1639-1644PubMed Google Scholar), and nuclear targeting of HDGF was reported to be required for mitogenesis (13Everett A.D. Stoops T. McNamara C.A. J. Biol.

Expression of HDGF was described during nephrogenesis (10Oliver J.A. Al-Awqati Q. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1208-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), cardiogenesis (15Everett A.D. Dev. Dyn. 2001; 222: 450-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and hepatogenesis (16Enomoto H. Yoshida K. Kishima Y. Kinoshita T. Yamamoto M. Everett A.D. Miyajima A. Nakamura H. Hepatology. 2002; 36: 1519-1527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HDGF has greatest homology in amino acid sequence (32%) to high mobility group 1 (HMG1), which has been reported to have intranuclear and extracellular functions (17Muller S. Scaffidi P. Degryse B. Bonaldi T. Ronfani L. Agresti A. Beltrame M. Bianchi M.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4337-4340Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). HMG1 is an abundant component of mammalian nuclei (18Bustin M. Reeves R. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 54: 35-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Bianchi M.E. Beltrame M. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). It bends the double helix on binding through the minor groove and binds with high affinity to DNA that is already sharply bent, such as linker DNA at the entry and exit of nucleosomes (20Bianchi M.E. Beltrame M. Paonessa G. Science. 1989; 243: 1056-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 21Pil P.M. Chow C.S. Lippard S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9465-9469Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). HMG1, also called amphoterin, has been identified as an extracellular neurite growth factor (22Rauvala H. Pihlaskari R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16625-16635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as a secreted late mediator of endotoxin shock (23Wang H. Bloom O. Zhang M. Vishnubhakat J.M. Ombrellino M. Che J.

Immunol. 2000; 165: 2950-2954Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar), and furthermore as a molecule related to tumor metastasis (25Taguchi A. Blood D.C. del Toro G. Canet A. Lee D.C. Qu W. Tanji N. Lu Y. Lalla E. Fu C. Hofmann M.A. Kislinger T. Ingram M. Lu A. Tanaka H. Hori O. Ogawa S. Stern D.M. Schmidt A.M. Nature. 2000; 405: 354-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar), supporting the notion that it functions in the extracellular space. In HDGF, the absence of the “HMG box,” which is essential for binding DNA, also strongly suggests that HDGF has extracellular roles. Although intensively studied in many tissues and cells, HDGF has not been investigated in the nervous system. We examined the localization of HDGF in the mouse nervous system and found that it is abundantly expressed in neurons. Since neurons do not replicate, HDGF cannot be considered a proliferation-inducing factor for neurons. In the present report, we describe the neurotrophic effects of HDGF harbored in nuclei. Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis was carried out according to the method of Sambrook et al. (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Protein was solubilized in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100. The concentration of the protein was determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). The protein was subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to an Immobilon membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). It was blocked by incubation for 24 h at 4 °C with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl). The membrane was then incubated with anti-HDGF polyclonal antibody (C terminus) (14Kishima Y. Yamamoto H. Izumoto Y. Yoshida K. Enomoto H. Yamamoto M. Kuroda T. Ito H. Yoshizaki K. Nakamura H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10315-10322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) at a dilution of 1:5000 in the blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. After being washed with TBS-Tween/Triton buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, and 0.2% Triton X-100), the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Cappel, Aurora, OH) at a dilution of 1:5000 in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. After another wash, the membrane was developed using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). In Situ Hybridization—In situ hybridization was carried out according to the method of Yamamoto et al. (27Yamamoto Y. Livet J. Pollock R.A. Garces A. Arce V. deLapeyriere O. Henderson C.E. Development. 1997; 124: 2903-2913PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. cDNA encoding mouse HDGF (nucleotides 356–775) (2Izumoto Y. Kuroda T. Harada H. Kishimoto T. Nakamura H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) was inserted into pBluescript II (Stratagene). Probes were prepared using a Digoxigenin RNA Labeling Kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Corresponding sense probes were used as controls. Eight-week-old male mice (C57BL/6) were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (5 mg/kg) intraperitoneally. Brains were carefully removed, frozen in dry ice powder, and stored at -80 °C until sectioning. Serial sections (15 μm) were cut with a cryostat (Bright; Huntington, UK). After being mounted onto slides, sections were dried with a dryer and fixed in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. After being washed with PBS, sections were treated with 10 μg/ml proteinase K containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 5 mm EDTA, and the reaction was stopped by treating with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min. Sections were covered overnight at 55 °C with hybridization buffer (50% deionized formamide, 0.3 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10% dextran sulfate, 0.02% Ficoll, 0.02% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.02% bovine serum albumin, 500 μg/ml yeast tRNA, 0.2 mg/ml salmon testes DNA, 0.2% n-lauroyl sarcosine sodium salt) containing 0.5 μg/ml antisense or sense probes. The following day, the sections were subjected to a series of stringent washes and RNase treatment before immunological detection with anti-digoxigenin-AP conjugate (1: 1000; Roche Applied Science) for 1 h at room temperature. The sections were then washed and exposed to a coloring reaction solution of 450 μg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium chloride (Roche Applied Science) and 175 μg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate (Roche Applied Science). Immunohistochemistry—Eight-week-old male mice (C57BL/6) were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (15 mg/kg) intraperitoneally and then perfused transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4. Brains were carefully removed and postfixed overnight at 4 °C in the same fixative. Tissue blocks were rinsed for 1 h with PBS and dehydrated through a series of increasing concentrations of ethanol. After dehydration, they were cleared with chloroform and xylene and then embedded in paraffin. The blocks were sectioned 6-μm-thick onto poly-l-lysine-coated slides (Matsunami, Japan). The sections were deparaffinized, and endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by incubation with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 10 min at room temperature. The sections were incubated with anti-HDGF polyclonal antibody (C terminus) (14Kishima Y. Yamamoto H. Izumoto Y. Yoshida K. Enomoto H. Yamamoto M. Kuroda T. Ito H. Yoshizaki K. Nakamura H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10315-10322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) at a dilution of 1:2000 in blocking buffer (2% bovine serum albumin in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. Control staining was conducted without the primary antibody or with preabsorbed antibody, in which the diluted primary antibody and 2 μm recombinant HDGF had been mixed and incubated at 4 °C for 24 h. After being washed with PBS, the sections were incubated with secondary antibody labeled with peroxidase (Histofine simple stain kit; Nichirei, Japan) for 30 min. The sections were visualized with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine and hydrogen peroxide and counterstained with hematoxylin. Preparation of Mouse Primary Hippocampal Neurons—Mouse primary hippocampal neurons were prepared from embryonic day 17 C57BL/6 mouse embryos, with some modifications of the published protocol (28Lindholm D. Carroll P. Tzimagiorgis G. Thoenen H. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 1452-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Fetal hippocampi were dissected and digested with calcium/magnesium-free Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) containing 0.025% trypsin for 8 min at 37 °C. The supernatant was then removed, and the tissues were dissociated by repeated trituration with 0.1 mg/ml DNase in Hanks' balanced salt solution and layered gently on a 1-ml cushion of bovine serum albumin (4% w/v) in a 15-ml plastic tube. After centrifugation, cells were seeded onto poly-dl-ornithine (Sigma), laminin (Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA)-coated dishes at a density of 1 × 105/cm2 and maintained in serum-free defined medium at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% room air. The serum-free defined medium consisted of neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen), 0.3 g/liter glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. The purity of the neurons was confirmed to be more than 90% at day 1 and 95% at days 2 and 4 by staining with anti-neuronal class III-β-tubulin (Berkeley Antibody Company, Richmond, CA), rabbit anti-cow anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (DAKO, Denmark), and propidium iodide (4 μg/ml). Secretion of HDGF and HMG1—Mouse primary hippocampal neurons were prepared as described above. Neurons were seeded onto poly-dl-ornithine (Sigma), laminin (Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA)-coated 6-cm tissue culture dishes (Falcon) at a density of 1 × 105/cm2 and cultured for 24 h in neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen), 0.3 g/liter glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% room air. After washing with PBS, 4 ml of Krebs-Ringer medium, consisting of 124 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2,1mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 26 mm NaHCO3, and 10 mm glucose, was conditioned by incubation with the hippocampal neurons for 3 h. The conditioned medium was then collected and concentrated 100-fold using a Centricon YM-10 (Millipore). The cells were solubilized in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100. For analyses of the mouse neuroblastoma cell line Neuro2a, 1 × 106 cells were seeded onto a 10-cm tissue culture dish (Corning) and cultured until ∼70% confluence in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% room air. After washing with PBS, 4 ml of Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen) supplemented with N-2 (Invitrogen) was conditioned by incubation with the Neuro2a cells for 3 h. The conditioned medium and the cells were then treated as described above. Fifteen microliters of the concentrated conditioned medium and 1 μg of the cell extract were used for Western blot analysis with anti-HDGF polyclonal antibody (C terminus) (14Kishima Y. Yamamoto H.

Induction of Cell Damage—Three hundred thousand Neuro2a cells were seeded onto 3.5-cm tissue culture dishes (Falcon) and incubated until ∼90% confluence in Eagles' minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% room air. After washing with PBS, the medium was replaced with 2 ml of Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen), and the Neuro2a cells were either induced to undergo necrosis by treatment with 10 μm ionomycin (Sigma) and 20 μm carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (Sigma) for 24 h or induced to undergo apoptosis by treatment with 300 nm etoposide (Sigma) for 24 h. Neuro2a cells without treatment served as a control. For Western blot analysis, the media from treated and untreated cells in 3.5-cm tissue culture dishes were collected and concentrated 10-fold using a Centricon YM-10 (Millipore). For staining, 5 × 103 Neuro2a cells were seeded onto 8-well chamber slides (Nunc) and induced to undergo necrosis or apoptosis and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. After being washed with PBS, cells were permeabilized with 50 mm l-lysine and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min and blocked for 1 h with 10% normal goat serum in PBS. Cells were incubated with rabbit anti-HDGF polyclonal antibody (C terminus) (14Kishima Y. Yamamoto H. Izumoto Y. Yoshida K. Enomoto H. Yamamoto M. Kuroda T. Ito H. Yoshizaki K. Nakamura H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10315-10322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) in PBS containing 5% normal goat serum for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS, the bound primary antibodies were labeled by incubation with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to fluorescein (1:50; Cappel) in PBS containing 5% normal goat serum. After further washing, the cells were treated with propidium iodide (4 μg/ml), mounted, and observed with an Olympus microscope equipped with epifluorescent filters. Laser scanning was performed with a Zeiss LSM510, Axiovert 25 confocal imaging system. Assessment of Neuronal Survival and Death—Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MA). Recombinant HDGF was purified as previously described (16Enomoto H. Yoshida K. Kishima Y. Kinoshita T. Yamamoto M. Everett A.D. Miyajima A. Nakamura H. Hepatology. 2002; 36: 1519-1527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse primary hippocampal neurons were prepared as described above. After a 6-h incubation with the serum-free defined medium (neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen), 0.3 g/liter glutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin), the medium was replaced with serum-free defined medium lacking B27 (Invitrogen) in order to study neuronal survival (28Lindholm D. Carroll P. Tzimagiorgis G. Thoenen H. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 1452-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) but containing BDNF (10 pg/ml, 100 pg/ml, 1 ng/ml, 10 ng/ml, or 100 ng/ml) to determine the optimal BDNF concentration. Half of the medium was exchanged every other day, and after 5 days of incubation, cell viability and death were assessed using the MTT colorimetric assay (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) and a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) Assay Kit (Wako, Japan), respectively. Neuronal survival was almost identical in the presence of BDNF at concentrations of 10 and 100 ng/ml. Finally, to examine the neurotrophic effect of HDGF, we added HDGF (1, 10, 100, or 500 ng/ml) or an optimal concentration of BDNF (10 ng/ml) to primary hippocampal neurons. Survival values were normalized, taking the survival value without factors as 0% and that in 10 ng/ml BDNF as 100%. All experiments were carried out in triplicate and repeated four times.

The annealed oligonucleotides (5′-gatccccTCCAAGGAGAAGTTTGGCAttcaagagaTGCCAAACTTCTCCTTGGAtttttggaaa-3′ and 5′-agcttttccaaaaaTCCAAGGAGAAGTTTGGCAtctcttgaaTGCCAAACTTCTCCTTGGAggg-3′) were ligated into the vector. The 19-nucleotide HDGF target sequence is indicated in capital letters in the oligonucleotide sequence. The plasmid constructed was designated pSUPER-HDGF. Assessment of Survival of Endogenous HDGF-suppressed Neurons— For transfection, primary hippocampal neurons were seeded at a density of 1 × 105/cm2 onto 3.5-cm tissue culture dishes (Falcon) and cultured for 24 h in neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen), 0.3 g/liter glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. In the serum-free defined medium supplemented with B27, ∼65% of neurons were alive 5 days after transfection, compared with the number 1 day after transfection without trophic factors. The transfection of primary hippocampal neurons has proven to be inefficient, is often toxic to the cells, and does not yield reproducible results. To rectify this situation, we performed the co-transfection of two plasmids, pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) to mark the transfected cells and pSUPER-HDGF to suppress endogenous HDGF expression. The ratio of the plasmids was adjusted so that more than 98% of the GFP-positive cells were endogenous HDGF-suppressed cells. We used FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions for its low toxicity and obtained reproducible results. The transfection efficiency was found to be ∼10%. In this paradigm, although the transfection efficiency is low, one can follow endogenous HDGF-suppressed neurons using GFP and analyze the time course of the marked cells with and without exogenously supplied HDGF. To test whether exogenously supplied HDGF protects neurons against death, recombinant HDGF (100 ng/ml) was added at the time of transfection. From 1 to 5 days after transfection, GFP-positive neurons were counted every day with a Nikon DIAPHOT TMD 300 culture cell viewing microscope system. Twenty random microscopic fields at × 200 magnification were counted for each dish. The transfection efficiencies for each condition were rather constant for each experiment as assessed from the GFP-positive neurons. Thus, the percentage of GFP-positive neurons after transfection was calculated in relation to the number of GFP-positive neurons at 1 day after transfection, defined as 100% for each condition. Assays were performed in triplicate for seven independent experiments. Statistical Analysis—Statistical comparisons among groups were made using one-way analysis of variance. Student's t test was used for the post hoc comparison of individual mean values. p values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Data shown represent the means ± S.E. HDGF Is Synthesized and Localized Mainly in Neurons in the Nervous System—It has been observed that HDGF mRNA is expressed in the brain using Northern blot analysis (1Nakamura H. Izumoto Y. Kambe H. Kuroda T. Mori T. Kawamura K. Yamamoto H. Kishimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25143-25149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Everett A.D. Dev. Dyn. 2001; 222: 450-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To examine the expression of HDGF protein in the nervous system, a developmental study was carried out by Western blot analysis of the mouse brain (Fig. 1). We found that HDGF protein was constantly expressed in the brain from embryonic day 13 until 2 years of age. To identify cells producing HDGF in the nervous system, in situ hybridization was performed using 8-week-old male mouse brains. HDGF mRNA was highly expressed in neurons, especially in hippocampal neurons and Purkinje cells (Fig. 2, A, C, and E). No significant staining was observed with sense probes (data not shown). To examine the localization of HDGF protein in the nervous system, immunohistochemical experiments were carried out using 8-week-old male mouse brains. No staining was visible without the primary antibody (data not shown) or with the preabsorbed antibody (Fig. 2H). HDGF was highly stained in the nuclei of most of the hippocampal neurons and Purkinje cells (Fig. 2, B, D, and F). In cerebral cortex, most of the neurons were stained with anti-HDGF antibody. Although some glial cells were stained with anti-HDGF antibody, most of them were HDGF-negative (Fig. 2G). These results indicate that HDGF is continuously produced in the nervous system and that in adult mice, HDGF is produced mainly in neurons and retained in their nuclei. HDGF and HMG1 Are Secreted in Physiological Conditions—We tested whether HDGF and HMG1 were secreted in neuronal cells, using mouse primary hippocampal neurons and the mouse neuroblastoma cell line Neuro2a. The purity of the neurons was confirmed to be more than 90% (Fig. 3A). As shown in Fig. 3, B and C, both HDGF and HMG1 were detected in the conditioned media by Western blot analysis. This result was consistent with previous reports showing that HMG1 was secreted by certain cells (25Taguchi A. Blood D.C. del Toro G. Canet A. Lee D.C. Qu W. Tanji N. Lu Y. Lalla E. Fu C.

Tracey K.J. Surgery. 1999; 126: 389-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). We also estimated the amount of HDGF by Western blot analysis using a series of recombinant HDGFs as standards (data not shown). The amount of HDGF in the medium of the hippocampal neuronal culture was estimated to be ∼13 pg/24 h/105 cells. The amount in the hippocampal neurons in culture was ∼1.3 ng/105 cells. Thus, approximately one-hundredth of the intracellular HDGF in the hippocampal neurons was secreted over 24 h in vitro. Necrotic Cells Release HDGF—It has been reported that HMG1 is passively released from necrotic cells, whereas apoptotic cells retain HMG1 in their nuclei (32Scaffidi P. Misteli T. Blanchi M.E. Nature. 2002; 418: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (3394) Google Scholar). We tested whether HDGF was released under pathological conditions, using the Neuro2a cell line. More than 50% of the cells underwent necrosis or apoptosis after 24 h of treatment at 37 °C. Western blot analysis showed that with a short exposure, HDGF was not detected in the conditioned medium from apoptotic cells, whereas it was detected in the conditioned medium from untreated cells and necrotic cells (Fig. 4A, a). With a longer exposure, although the band was faint, HDGF was detected in the conditioned medium from apoptotic cells (Fig. 4A, b). Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that HDGF was localized in the nuclei of untreated cells and apoptotic cells, whereas HDGF was found neither in necrotic nuclei nor cytoplasm (Fig. 4B). Thus, HDGF is tightly associated with the nucleus, even when the cells are induced to undergo apoptosis. By contrast, HDGF was dissociated from the nuclei of necrotic cells and released from these cells. The fact that a large amount of HDGF was released by necrotic cells suggests that nuclear HDGF is more abundant than the secreted HDGF. The concentration of HDGF was higher in the medium of untreated cells than that of apoptotic cells, indicating that apoptotic cells could not secrete HDGF actively. A small amount of HDGF was detected in the medium from apoptotic cells, suggesting that apoptotic cells also release a small amount of HDGF or so"
https://openalex.org/W1995179505,"Discoidin domain receptors 1 and 2 (DDR1 and DDR2) are tyrosine kinase receptors activated by triple-helical collagens. Aberrant expression and signaling of these receptors have been implicated in several human diseases linked to accelerated matrix degradation and remodeling including tumor invasion, atherosclerosis and liver fibrosis. The objective of this study is to characterize the collagen-binding sites in the discoidin domains of DDR1 and DDR2 at a molecular level. We expressed glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins containing the discoidin and extracellular domains of DDR1 and DDR2 in insect cells and subjected them to a solid-phase collagen-binding assay. We found high affinity binding of the DDR extracellular domains to immobilized type I collagen and confirmed the discoidin-collagen interaction with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based read-out. Furthermore, we created a three-dimensional model of the DDR1 discoidin domain based on the related domains of blood coagulation factors V and VIII. This model predicts the presence of four neighboring, surface-exposed loops that are topologically equivalent to a major phospholipid-binding site in factors V and VIII. To test the involvement of these loops in collagen binding, we mutated individual amino acid residues to alanine or deleted short sequence stretches within these loops. We found that several residues within loop 1 (Ser-52–Thr-57) and loop 3 (Arg-105–Lys-112) as well as Ser-175 in loop 4 are critically involved in collagen binding. Our structure-function analysis of the DDR discoidin domains provides new insights into this non-integrin-mediated collagen-signaling mechanism and may ultimately lead to the design of small molecule inhibitors that interfere with aberrant DDR function.

Collagens are the most abundant proteins found in the animal kingdom. Whereas some collagens are key structural components in load-bearing tissues, others are essential elements of basement membranes. Collagens have a pivotal role in regulating cellular differentiation and pattern formation during embryogenesis and postnatal development. Increased synthesis of fibrillar collagens or perturbed turnover correlates with a variety of human diseases, including liver fibrosis, glomerulonephritis, vascular diseases, or tumor angiogenesis (1Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. Ann. Med. 2001; 33: 7-21Google Scholar). Three different types of collagen-receptors are currently known: the tyrosine kinases discoidin domain receptor 1 and 2 (DDR1 and DDR2), 1Abbreviations used are: DDR, discoidin domain receptors; DiscD, discoidin domain; Npn-1, neuropilin-1; HA, hemagglutinin; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; ExD, extracellular domain. four integrin heterodimers containing the β1 subunit, and glycoprotein VI (2Vogel W.F. Eur. J. Dermatol. 2001; 11: 506-514Google Scholar). Although glycoprotein VI is only found on platelets, both integrins and DDR are widely expressed and trigger an array of signaling pathways upon collagen binding. DDR1 and DDR2 are characterized by a ∼155-amino acid discoidin homology domain (DiscD) in the extracellular region of the protein. The discoidin domain is followed by a 200-amino acid stretch termed the stalk region, a single transmembrane peptide, a juxtamembrane region, and the catalytic tyrosine kinase domain (Fig. 1A). DDR1 was isolated from a number of different human tissues and carcinoma cell lines (3Alves F. Vogel W. Mossie K. Millauer B. Hofler H. Ullrich A. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 609-618Google Scholar, 4Nemoto T. Ohashi K. Akashi T. Johnson J.D. Hirokawa K. Pathobiology. 1997; 65: 195-203Google Scholar, 5Weiner H.L. Huang H. Zagzag D. Boyce H.

RNA in situ hybridization analysis showed specific expression of human DDR1 in epithelial cells, particularly in the mammary gland, brain, kidney, lung and the mucosa of the colon (3Alves F. Vogel W. Mossie K. Millauer B. Hofler H. Ullrich A. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 609-618Google Scholar). DDR2 is also widely expressed, particularly in skeletal and heart muscle, kidney, and skin. DDR1 knockout mice are consistently smaller than wild-type littermates, and most of the female knockout mice are unable to give birth because developing blastocysts do not implant (9Vogel W.F. Aszodi A. Alves F. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2906-2917Google Scholar). Female mice that do successfully reproduce are unable to nourish their litters because the mammary gland epithelium fails to secret milk. DDR1 is therefore a key regulator of cell morphogenesis, differentiation, and collagen synthesis. DDR2-null mice are also smaller compared with their wild-type littermates, and healing of epidermal wounds (which is normal in the absence of DDR1) is significantly delayed in the absence of DDR2 (10Labrador J.P. Azcoitia V. Tuckermann J. Lin C. Olaso E. Manes S. Bruckner K. Goergen J.L. Lemke G. Yancopoulos G. Angel P. Martinez C. Klein R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 446-452Google Scholar). Both activated DDR induce the expression of specific metalloproteases, including MMP1 and MMP2 (11Vogel W. Gish G.D. Alves F. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 13-23Google Scholar, 12Ikeda K. Wang L.H. Torres R. Zhao H. Olaso E. Eng F.J. Labrador P. Klein R. Lovett D. Yancopoulos G.D. Friedman S.L. Lin H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19206-19212Google Scholar). DDR1 autophosphorylation is stimulated by all collagens tested (types I–VI and VIII), whereas DDR2 is only activated by fibrillar collagens (types I–III and V). Heat-denatured collagen (gelatin), which is no longer triple-helical in structure, fails to induce DDR kinase activity (11Vogel W. Gish G.D. Alves F. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 13-23Google Scholar). The discoidin domain of DDR1 contains a functionally essential collagen binding site, yet the minimal binding sequence(s) on collagen remains elusive (13Curat C.A. Eck M. Dervillez X. Vogel W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45952-45958Google Scholar). Discoidin domain repeats are also found in about 20 other, mostly secreted proteins (14Baumgartner S. Hofmann K. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Bucher P. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1626-1631Google Scholar, 15Vogel W. FASEB J. 1999; 13: S77-S82Google Scholar). The structures of the C-terminal discoidin domain present in the two blood coagulation factors V and VIII and in the ectodomain of the neuronal receptor neuropilin-1 (Npn-1) have been determined by x-ray crystallography (16Lee C.C. Kreusch A. McMullan D. Ng K. Spraggon G. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 99-108Google Scholar, 17Macedo-Ribeiro S. Bode W. Huber R. Quinn-Allen M.A. Kim S.W. Ortel T.L. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Stubbs M.T. Kane W.H. Fuentes-Prior P. Nature. 1999; 402: 434-439Google Scholar, 18Pratt K.P. Shen B.W. Takeshima K. Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Stoddard B.S. Nature. 1999; 402: 439-442Google Scholar). The central feature of all three domains is an eight-stranded antiparallel β-barrel. Although most strands are connected by short turns, in each structure, several extended neighboring loops (or spikes) protrude from the “bottom” of the β-barrel (18Pratt K.P. Shen B.W. Takeshima K. Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Stoddard B.S. Nature. 1999; 402: 439-442Google Scholar, 19Fuentes-Prior P. Fujikawa K. Pratt K.P. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2002; 3: 313-339Google Scholar). These loops are involved in the membrane binding of factors V and VIII (17Macedo-Ribeiro S. Bode W. Huber R. Quinn-Allen M.A. Kim S.W. Ortel T.L. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Stubbs M.T. Kane W.H. Fuentes-Prior P. Nature. 1999; 402: 434-439Google Scholar, 19Fuentes-Prior P. Fujikawa K. Pratt K.P. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2002; 3: 313-339Google Scholar) and most probably also in the binding of Npn-1 to its ligands, semaphorin 3A and vascular endothelial growth factor (20Mamluk R. Gechtman Z. Kutcher M.E. Gasiunas N. Gallagher J. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24818-24825Google Scholar). A disulfide bond links the N- and C-terminal ends in the three structures and is predicted in all mammalian proteins featuring discoidin domains. The importance of studying the structural aspects of discoidin domains is underscored by the fact that mutations within the discoidin domain have been linked to several human diseases: the two most prominent cases are hemophilia and retinoschisis. In human factor V and VIII, point mutations found in the discoidin domain cause parahemophilia and hemophilia A, respectively (21Kane W.H. Davie E.W. Blood. 1988; 71: 539-555Google Scholar, 22Liu M.L. Shen B.W. Nakaya S. Pratt K.P. Fujikawa K. Davie E.W. Stoddard B.L. Thompson A.R. Blood. 2000; 96: 979-987Google Scholar). Point mutations in retinoschisin, a secreted protein that consists of a single discoidin domain, are the cause of retinoschisis, a genetic disorder characterized by macular deterioration and early blindness (23Grayson C. Reid S.N. Ellis J.A. Rutherford A. Sowden J.C. Yates J.R. Farber D.B. Trump D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1873-1879Google Scholar, 24Mooy C.M. Van Den Born L.I. Baarsma S. Paridaens D.A. Kraaijenbrink T. Bergen A. Weber B.H. Arch. Ophthalmol. 2002; 120: 979-984Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent work on the protein SED1 indicated that its discoidin domains are centrally involved in cell-matrix communication during sperm-egg binding (25Ensslin M.A. Shur B.D. Cell. 2003; 114: 405-417Google Scholar). In this study, we use site-directed mutagenesis to closely map the collagen-binding regions in the discoidin domain of DDR1. We identified two loops and two single amino acid residues within the loop regions that are essential for collagen-DDR1 recognition. Furthermore, we generated recombinantly expressed DDR1 and DDR2 collagen-binding domains to quantify the receptor-ligand affinity. Molecular Modeling—A preliminary model of the human DDR1 discoidin domain automatically generated using SWISS-MODEL software (www.expasy.org/swissmod/) was overlaid on the three-dimensional structures of factor V (C2 domain, PDB code 1CZT; Ref. 17Macedo-Ribeiro S. Bode W. Huber R. Quinn-Allen M.A. Kim S.W. Ortel T.L. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Stubbs M.T. Kane W.H. Fuentes-Prior P. Nature. 1999; 402: 434-439Google Scholar), factor VIII (C2 domain, PDB code 1D7P; Ref. 18Pratt K.P. Shen B.W. Takeshima K. Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Stoddard B.S. Nature. 1999; 402: 439-442Google Scholar), and Npn-1 (b1 domain, PDB code 1KEX; Ref. 16Lee C.C. Kreusch A. McMullan D. Ng K. Spraggon G. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 99-108Google Scholar), manually corrected at a few positions, and subjected to energy minimization using CNS software (cns.csb.yale.edu/v1.1/). The minimized model was employed for the rational design of mutations/deletions. In particular, we verified that limited deletion of loop residues would not affect formation of the central β-barrel; i.e. the shortened loops would still span the distance between conserved residues at the start/end of the barrel strands, with all loop residues adopting stereochemically favorable conformations. The alignment of discoidin domains was performed using ClustalW (www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/) and corrected at a few positions according to the structural information. DDR1 Mutagenesis—To tag the full-length human DDR1 cDNA with the HA sequence, a unique NheI site was introduced into the plasmid pRK5-DDR1b before the stop codon. A synthetic linker coding for the HA sequence was then inserted into the NheI site. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to introduce single point mutations (W53A, D55A, S66A, D68A, R105A, H106A, L110A, K112A, V173A, M174A, and S175A), a multiple missense mutation with a single residue deletion (ΔW53-S54A-D55A-S56A), and multiple residue deletions (ΔS52-T57, ΔD68-D70, ΔG108-K112, ΔR105-K112, ΔD171-R172). The numbering refers to full-length DDR1 including its signal peptide. The mutants W53A, R105A, and L110A were not HA-tagged. All constructs were sequenced to verify the presence of the respective mutation. Primer sequences used for site-directed mutagenesis are available upon request. Transient Transfection Assay—Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were transfected with 20 μg of DNA per 10 cm dish using the calcium phosphate transfection procedure (11Vogel W. Gish G.D. Alves F. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 13-23Google Scholar). The medium was replaced with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 18 h after transfection. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were stimulated with 10 μg/ml rat type I collagen (BD Biosciences). Ninety minutes after stimulation, cells were lysed using either Triton X-100-based lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 10 mg/ml aprotinin) for immunoprecipitation or Tween 20-based lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1% Tween 20, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 10mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 10 mg/ml aprotinin) for ELISA. GST Fusion Protein Purification—DDR1 and DDR2 discoidin and extracellular domains were amplified from human cDNAs. Inserts were subcloned in-frame into pAcG2T (BD Biosciences), resulting in an N-terminal fusion with glutathione S-transferase (GST). The pAcG2T constructs functioned as transfer vectors for the BaculoGold expression system (BD Biosciences). Attenuated BaculoGold DNA was co-transfected with each transfer vector into Sf9 (Spodoptera frugiperda) cells grown in TNM-FH media (Hyclone) with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2% glutamine, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, and 2.5 μg/ml Fungizone at 27 °C. Viruses were amplified for three rounds in sequentially larger monolayer culture dishes (25, 75, and 150 cm2). Five days after infection, viral supernatants were harvested for the next round of amplification. Recombinant viruses were used to infect HiV (Trichoplusia ni) cells grown in monolayer cultures in the above medium. Cells were incubated at 27 °C for 2 days and then lysed using SD buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 10 mg/ml aprotinin) with 2.5% Triton X-100. Cell lysates were added to glutathione-linked-agarose beads (BD Biosciences Clontech), incubated for 2 h at 4 °C and subsequently washed using SD buffer. To elute protein, 1 bead volume of glutathione elution buffer (100 mm glutathione, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 100 mm Tris, pH 8.5) was incubated with the beads at 4 °C for 15 min. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Lysates from 293 cells were diluted 1:1 (v/v) in HNTG buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol) and incubated with anti-DDR1b antibody (13Curat C.A. Eck M. Dervillez X. Vogel W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45952-45958Google Scholar) coupled to protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 3 h. Beads were washed four times with HNTG buffer and denatured in Laemmli buffer (187.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 6% SDS, 30% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and 15% 2-mercaptoethanol). Proteins were separated on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels and subjected to Western blotting. Samples were probed using a monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10; Upstate Biotechnology) diluted 1:500 in NET-Gel (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.05% gelatin). Western blots were developed using secondary horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were stripped (65 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol) and re-probed with anti-DDR1 polyclonal (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-HA monoclonal (Sigma) antibody and secondary HRP-linked anti-rabbit or -mouse IgG. Lysates from HiV cells were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with polyclonal antibodies raised against the N-terminal regions of DDR1 and DDR2, respectively (11Vogel W. Gish G.D. Alves F. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 13-23Google Scholar). The blots were stripped and re-probed with an anti-GST-linked-HRP monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz). For membrane fractionation, cells were lysed with Tris-sucrose buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm sucrose), homogenized, and centrifuged at 3000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant containing cytoplasmic and transmembrane fractions was isolated and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet was resuspended in Tris-sucrose buffer and immunoprecipitated overnight with an anti-DDR1b antibody. Beads were washed three times with Tris-sucrose buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. DDR1 was detected using a monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Sigma). Collagen-DDR1 ELISA—Type I collagen was diluted in phosphate-buffered saline to a concentration of 50 μg/ml and added to 96-well microtiter plates (50 μl/well). Plates were incubated for 1 h at room temperature and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Wells were blocked with 150 μl of 1 mg/ml BSA in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h. Wells were washed once with 150 μl of wash buffer (0.5 mg/ml BSA in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20). DDR1-transfected 293 cells were lysed with Tween 20-based lysis buffer, and lysate was added to each well and incubated at room temperature overnight (lysates were normalized for cell number by Western blot analysis before ELISA). Wells were washed six times with wash buffer. 50-μl aliquots of diluted anti-DDR1 C-terminal antibody (1:500 dilution in wash buffer) were added and incubated for 90 min. Wells were washed six times with wash buffer and incubated with HRP-linked anti-rabbit secondary antibody for 90 min. Bound protein was detected using 75 μl/well of 0.5 mg/ml o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich) in 50 mm citrate-phosphate buffer (50 mm sodium citrate and 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 5.0) with 0.012% hydrogen peroxide. After 30 min at room temperature, the reaction was stopped using 50 μl/well of 3 m sulfuric acid. Plates were analyzed in an ELISA reader at 490 nm, buffer only-values were subtracted, and normalized values were subjected to statistical analysis using Microsoft Excel. All experiments were performed in triplicate. For the ELISA of GST-DDR binding to collagen, purified recombinant proteins were added to collagen-coated wells and incubated at room temperature for 3 h. Wells were washed six times with wash buffer, and 50-μl aliquots of anti-GST monoclonal antibody (diluted 1:1000 in wash buffer) were added for 1 h at room temperature. After six washes, bound protein was detected as above. For collagen-DDR1 loop peptide ELISA, 100 μl of lysate from 293 cells transfected with DDR1 were added to each collagen-coated well along with loop peptides in 1250-fold molar excess (relative to collagen) and incubated at room temperature overnight. Binding was detected using polyclonal rabbit anti-DDR1 C-terminal antibody and secondary HRP-linked anti-rabbit IgG antibody. DDR1 and DDR2 constitute a unique pair of tyrosine kinase receptors because they are activated not by soluble growth factors but by native, triple-helical collagen. Although previous work has shown that the DDR-collagen interaction is direct, the molecular basis of this interaction, in particular the precise role of the discoidin domain, remains unclear. To study this interaction, we decided to produce the discoidin domain or the entire extracellular domain (ExD) of DDR1 and DDR2 as recombinant proteins in insect cells. The constructs were expressed as GST fusion proteins in HiV insect cells (Fig. 1B). The ExD of DDR1 and DDR2 fused to GST were detected as 73-kDa proteins and the DiscD fusion proteins as 47-kDa proteins (Fig. 1, C and D). To test the functionality of the fusion proteins, we mixed equal amounts of insect cell lysates with native type I collagen immobilized on agarose beads. We found specific binding of all four DDR fusion proteins to collagen, whereas GST alone showed no binding (Fig. 1, E and F). Purification of the GST fusion proteins by glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography yielded significant amounts of all four constructs (0.1–1.0 mg of protein per 108 cells). Proteins were eluted by glutathione displacement and were subjected to an ELISA-based binding assay. Plates coated with 50 μg/ml type I collagen were incubated with various concentrations of purified GST fusion proteins, and the amount of bound material was quantified by anti-GST ELISA (Fig. 2). At a 100 nm protein concentration, the DDR1-DiscD fused to GST had a 14-fold higher affinity to collagen than GST alone. We were surprised to find that DDR1-ExD had about a 10-fold higher affinity to collagen than the DiscD alone, in that DDR1-ExD binding reached a plateau at a protein concentration of ∼10 nm compared with 100 nm for DDR1-DiscD. The DDR2-DiscD showed a binding profile similar to that of DDR2-ExD, with no significant increase in binding capacity upon addition of the stalk region. In contrast to DDR1-ExD, the DDR2-ExD had much lower affinity for type I collagen, and a linear increase in binding was observed through all concentrations measured (60–180 nm). These differences between DDR1 and DDR2 are possibly caused by diverse sequence motifs within the stalk region. The overall identity between the two sequences is much lower for the stalk regions than for the discoidin domains (44% versus 58%). Furthermore, DDR1 shows a unique stretch of about 15 amino acids near the plasma membrane (amino acids 385–399) that is not present in DDR2. Whereas previous work indicated that the discoidin domain of DDR1 is essential for binding to triple-helical collagen, the molecular composition of this binding epitope remains unknown (13Curat C.A. Eck M. Dervillez X. Vogel W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45952-45958Google Scholar). To address this question, we exploited the homology between the discoidin domains of human DDR and the following three related human discoidin domains: the C-terminal domain in coagulation factor V, the homologous domain in factor VIII, and the first discoidin domain in Npn-1. We selected these domains, because their three-dimensional structures were recently resolved by x-ray crystallography (16Lee C.C. Kreusch A. McMullan D. Ng K. Spraggon G. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 99-108Google Scholar, 17Macedo-Ribeiro S. Bode W. Huber R. Quinn-Allen M.A. Kim S.W. Ortel T.L. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Stubbs M.T. Kane W.H. Fuentes-Prior P. Nature. 1999; 402: 434-439Google Scholar, 18Pratt K.P. Shen B.W. Takeshima K. Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Stoddard B.S. Nature. 1999; 402: 439-442Google Scholar). Whereas all five sequences share less than 20% identity, the eight strands forming the central β-barrel are well conserved (Fig. 3A). Based on this alignment and the structural information, we generated a three-dimensional model for the DDR1-DiscD (Fig. 3B). The conserved N- and C-terminal cysteine residues (Cys-31 and Cys-185 in DDR1, respectively) form a disulfide bridge located at the top of the barrel. In addition, our model predicts that the Sγ atoms of Cys-74 and Cys-177 are optimally positioned to form a second disulfide bridge. More importantly, at the bottom of the barrel, four prominent, finger-like loops protrude (Fig. 3B). Each loop consists of about 7–11 amino acid residues, and the position of each loop within the primary sequence is conserved between DDR1 and other discoidin domains (as highlighted in Fig. 3A). Based on their exposed character in the molecular model and the relevance of the topologically equivalent regions of other discoidin domains for interactions with diverse ligands (19Fuentes-Prior P. Fujikawa K. Pratt K.P. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2002; 3: 313-339Google Scholar), we hypothesized that these loops may be involved in collagen-binding by DDR1. To test this hypothesis, we designed and produced mutant proteins with partial deletions of the loop sequences that were expected not to compromise the folding of the discoidin domain (Fig. 4A). In addition, we systematically mutated single amino acid residues located in these loops to alanine (Fig. 4B). In total, we created six deletion mutants and 11 point mutants within the context of the full-length DDR1 sequence. Although the initial set of mutants was created using the unmodified DDR1 cDNA (13Curat C.A. Eck M. Dervillez X. Vogel W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45952-45958Google Scholar), we also introduced an HA tag at the C terminus of the sequence, thereby allowing more accurate normalization of expression levels. We expressed individual mutants in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, stimulated these cells with type I collagen for 90 min, and determined DDR1 tyrosine phosphorylation by immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting. We found that the mutation of Arg-105 (in loop 3) almost completely abolished DDR1 activation (Fig. 5A), whereas the Ser-175 to alanine mutation in loop 4 entirely lost its responsiveness to collagen (Fig. 5C). No other single amino acid exchange had a measurable effect on DDR1 phosphorylation. Furthermore, modification of loop 1, by either deleting the sequence stretch Ser-52–Thr-57 or by deleting Trp-53 and alanine-mutating residues 54–56 resulted in significant but not complete ablation of DDR1 activity (Fig. 5C). In contrast, deletion of loop 2 (Δ68–70) did not perturb DDR1 function. In agreement with the R105A point mutant, a deletion of loop 3 (Δ105–112) had a detrimental effect on DDR1 phosphorylation. To show that all DDR1 mutant proteins are properly processed within the cell, we prepared membrane fractions of transfected 293 cells and showed equal amounts of DDR1 wild-type and mutant protein localized at the cell surface (Fig. 5E).Fig. 5Identification of collagen binding epitope by site-directed mutagenesis. A and C, tyrosine phosphorylation of DDR1 point mutants upon collagen stimulation. Individual mutants were expressed in 293 cells, and DDR1 immunoprecipitates were analyzed by antiphosphotyrosine (αPY) Western blotting. Phosphorylated DDR1 was detected as a 125-kDa protein. Blots were stripped and reprobed with anti-DDR1 antibodies (B and D) to verify equal expression of mutant proteins. E, membrane fractions of several mutants were isolated and probed with an antibody against the HA-tag to verify surface expression of DDR1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To directly quantify collagen-binding of various DDR1 mutants, we used the ELISA-based readout described above. Collagen-coated plates were incubated with lysates from DDR1 wild-type or mutant overexpressing cells. Bound protein was detected by a primary DDR1-specific antibody followed by a secondary horseradish-conjugated antibody. We found that the two point mutants R105A and S175A, which failed to be activated by collagen, largely failed to bind to collagen as well (Fig. 6). Several other point mutants, such as H106A, V173A, and M174A, had markedly reduced binding in the ELISA although they were still activated by collagen when assessed by antiphosphotyrosine Western blotting (Fig. 5). Deletion of residues within any of the four loops resulted in loss of collagen affinity to varying degrees. It was interesting to note that deletion of loop 1 (Δ52–57 and Δ53/54–56A) or loop 3 (Δ105–112 or Δ108–112) largely abolished the binding of the DDR1 discoidin domain to collagen, whereas deletion of loop 2 (Δ68–70) or loop 4 (Δ171–172) led only to a partial reduction. To further define the contribution of individual loop regions in binding collagen, we generated synthetic cyclic peptides mimicking loops 1–3 (Fig. 7A). We tested the ability of these peptides to compete with the bind"
https://openalex.org/W2149255022,"Fanconi anemia (FANC) is a heterogeneous genetic disorder characterized by a hypersensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, chromosomal instability, and defective DNA repair. Eight FANC genes have been identified so far, and five of them (FANCA, -C, -E, -F, and -G) assemble in a multinuclear complex and function at least in part in a complex to activate FANCD2 by monoubiquitination. Here we show that FANCA and FANCG are redox-sensitive proteins that are multimerized and/or form a nuclear complex in response to oxidative stress/damage. Both FANCA and FANCG proteins exist as monomers under non-oxidizing conditions, whereas they become multimers following H2O2 treatment. Treatment of cells with oxidizing agent not only triggers the multimeric complex of FANCA and FANCG in vivo but also induces the interaction between FANCA and FANCG. N-Ethylmaleimide treatment abolishes multimerization and interaction of FANCA and FANCG in vitro. Taken together, our results lead us to conclude that FANCA and FANCG uniquely respond to oxidative damage by forming complex(es) via intermolecular disulfide linkage(s), which may be crucial in forming such complexes and in determining their function.

The gene products of eight complementation groups of FANC have been identified and cloned (FANCA, FANCC, FANCD1, FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG, and FANCL) (1Joenje H. Oostra A.B.

Mutations in any of the eight different genes lead to FANC disease, a degree of genetic heterogeneity comparable with that of other DNA repair disorders, suggesting that each group represents a distinct protein.FANCA and FANCG proteins are part of a large nuclear protein complex required for their function, and the disruption of this complex results in the specific cellular and clinical phenotype common to most FANC complementation groups (4Garcia-Higuera I. Kuang Y. Naf D. Wasik J. D'Andrea A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4866-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). FANCA gene encodes a 162-kDa phosphoprotein and its phosphorylation correlated with FANCA/FANCC protein accumulation in the nucleus (5Yamashita T. Kupfer G.M. Naf D. Suliman A. Joenje H. Asano S. D'Andrea A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13085-13090Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). FANCA mutant cells isolated from a FANC patient were defective in their phosphorylation and failed to bind to FANCC. Furthermore, a mutant FANCA protein failed to complement the mitomycin C (MMC) sensitivity of FANCA–/– cells, suggesting that FANCA phosphorylation may be involved in FANCC interaction, nuclear localization of FANCA, or its function in cross-link repair. FANCG gene encodes a 65-kDa protein that has been identified as human XRCC9. XRCC9 (FANCG) complements the Chinese hamster ovary mutant UV-40 cell line that is hypersensitive to UV, ionizing radiation, simple alkylating agents, and DNA-cross-linking agents (6Busch D.B.

The mutant cells also show a high level of spontaneous chromosomal aberrations that can be fully corrected by introduction of XRCC9 cDNA transformants (7Liu N. Lamerdin J.E. Tucker J.D. Zhou Z.Q.

The possibility of the involvement of FANC proteins in DNA repair was strengthened by recent findings on the interaction of FANCD1 with BRCA1 following DNA damage (8Garcia-Higuera I. Taniguchi T.

FANCD1 is identical to BRCA2 gene and is unique among FANC genes in that it is essential for the formation of Rad51 foci in response to ionizing radiation (9Godthelp B.C. Artwert F. Joenje H. Zdzienicka M.Z. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5002-5005Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), suggesting that it may be involved in homologous recombination-mediated strand break repair.Cells lacking FANC gene showed a hypersensitive phenotype following H2O2 treatment, suggesting a role for FANC proteins in redox signaling and repair of oxidative DNA damages (Refs. 10Cumming R.C.

Although the detailed functions of FANC proteins have yet to be determined, there is a growing consensus on the role for FANC proteins in DNA repair and damage signaling pathways. In this study, we investigated the interaction of key FANC proteins following oxidative damage(s). We found that FANCA and FANCG are multimerized and/or form a complex via intermolecular disulfide linkage(s) in response to oxidative damage. Nuclear localization as well as FANCA-FANCG interaction occurs concomitantly with monoubiquitination of FANCD2 upon H2O2 treatment, suggesting that FANCA-FANCG interaction may be an early response to oxidative damage that plays a crucial role in DNA repair and damage signaling pathways.MATERIALS AND METHODSAntibodies and Chemicals—Anti-FANCA and -FANCG antisera (polyclonal) were generated in rabbits using immunogenic peptides with FANCA residues (525–544 (ENMGLYEDLSSAGDITEPHS) and 1230–1249 (HFAIQQVREENIRKQLKKLD)) and FANCG residues (101–120 (ERVLETQEQQGPRLEQGLRE) and 604–622 (DRDAFLEEFRTSLPKSCDL)). Anti-FLAG and anti-Myc antibodies were obtained from Sigma, and anti-FANCD2 antibody (monoclonal antibody NB100-316) was from Novus Biologicals. N-Ethylmaleimide, β-mercaptoethanol, and MMC were from Sigma, and DTT was from Roche Applied Science. H2O2 was obtained from Fisher.Cloning of FANCA and FANCG Genes—The cDNA for human FANCG was subcloned into pcDNA6.2-DEST (Invitrogen) by PCR using the forward primer 5′-CACCACCATGGAGCAGAAGCTTATTTCGGAGGAAGACCTATCC CGCCAGACCACCTCTGTGGGC-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-TCACAGGTCACAAGACTTTGGCAG-3′. Both primers contain a CACC sequence for recombination into pcDNA6.2-DEST, and the forward primer also encodes a Myc tag. Positive clones were isolated and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Human FANCA cDNA was subcloned into pFLAG (Kodak) at NotI and HindIII by PCR using the forward primer 5′-TCTGCGGCCCGATGTCCGACTCGTGGGTCCCG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TCTAAGCTTTCAGAAGAGATGAGGCTCCTG-3′. Positive clones were confirmed by restriction enzyme analysis and DNA sequencing. Positive clones (plasmids) were transfected into COS cells for expression. For GST-FANCG expression, human FANCG was subcloned into pAcG2T (Pharmingen) at EcoRI by PCR using the forward primer 5′-CGGGAATTCATTCCCGCCAGACCACC-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-CGGGAATTCCTACAGGTCACAAGAC-3′. Positive clones were confirmed by restriction analysis and DNA sequencing.Cell Cultures and Preparation of Cell Extracts—COS cells and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (Invitrogen), respectively, which were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), penicillin (10 units/ml, Sigma), and streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml, Sigma). For all experiments in this study, cells were in exponential growth phase. Cells were treated with H2O2 or MMC for 2 h at the indicated concentrations at 37 °C. After reagent exposure, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed directly on the 100-mm plates by adding 500 μl of cold lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40 in phosphate-buffered saline in the presence of 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, and mammalian protease inhibitor mixture) to each and scraping rapidly with a cell scraper. The cell lysates were centrifuged for 30 min at 20,000 × g, and the supernatant (the Nonidet P-40-soluble protein fraction) was harvested. The pellet (the Nonidet P-40-insoluble protein fraction) was washed once with lysis buffer and dissolved with SDS-sample loading buffer. These soluble and insoluble proteins were immediately analyzed by electrophoresis/immunoblotting or immunoprecipitation.Protein Purification—Anti-FLAG M2-agarose was used in purifying FLAG-FANCA protein according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma). The supernatants from transfected COS cell lysates were incubated at 4 °C for at least 4 h with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) that had been preequilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline buffer. The beads were then washed three times with 1% Nonidet P-40 in phosphate-buffered saline buffer. In the final step, the M2 column was eluted with 3 column volumes of 500 μg/ml FLAG peptide. GST-FANCG proteins were expressed in Sf9 insect cells following recombinant baculovirus infection (19Stigger E. Dean F.B. Hurwitz J. Lee S.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and purified by glutathione-Sepharose resin (Amersham Biosciences) and by fast protein liquid chromatography on a 1-ml HiTrap Q column (Amersham Biosciences) (20You J.S. Wang M. Lee S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7476-7485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Analysis—Cell lysates (25 μg/lane) or purified proteins were resolved on 6–8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions (10 mm DTT or 1% β-mercaptoethanol) or under non-reducing conditions. Proteins were then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and probed with an anti-FANCA or anti-FANCG antibody (a rabbit polyclonal IgG) or with an anti-FANCD2 antibody (monoclonal mouse IgG, Novus Biologicals) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Proteins were visualized by using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences).Immunoprecipitation—Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge for 10 min at 8,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatants were removed and incubated with anti-FLAG M2 antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. The mixture was then added to a 60-μl packed gel volume of protein G-agarose affinity beads (prewashed and equilibrated in lysis buffer) and incubated for 1 h with mixing at 4 °C. The beads were collected by centrifugation for 2 min at 2,000 × g, and the supernatants were removed by aspiration. The pellets were washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer/wash and collected by centrifugation as described. After washing, the affinity-bead pellets were each suspended in the presence of 30 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205998) Google Scholar) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.RESULTSMultimerization of FANC Proteins under Oxidizing Conditions—Increasing evidence points to a role for FANC proteins in redox signaling and the repair of oxidative damages (22Demple B. Harrison L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 915-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar, 23Kelley M.R. Tritt R. Xu Y. New S. Freie B. Clapp D.W. Deutsch W.A. Mutat. Res. 2001; 485: 107-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 24Pagano G. Youssoufian H. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In accordance with these findings, cells lacking FANC genes showed hypersensitivity to H2O2 treatment (Ref. 13Saadatzadeh M.R. Bijangi-Vishehsaraei K. Hong P. Bergmann H. Haneline L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16805-16812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar and data not shown). Because several FANC proteins (FANCA, FANCC, and FANCG) contain unusually high numbers of cysteines, we wondered whether some of these residues were directly involved in redox regulation. To examine possible redox regulation of FANC proteins, insect cells were transfected with recombinant baculovirus expressing GST-FANCG. Purified FANCG protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE following a brief air oxidation and the addition of reducing agent. Purified GST-FANCG migrated as multimers (>250 kDa in size) under oxidizing conditions, whereas it migrated as a monomer with increasing amounts of DTT (Fig. 1A). The transition from monomer to multimer likely occurred through the formation of intermolecular disulfide linkage(s) on FANCG but not on the GST portion of the fusion protein because purified GST did not form multimers regardless of its redox status (Fig. 1B). It is interesting to note that GST-FANCG (90 kDa) migrated more than one form of multimers in a range from 180 kDa to a much larger size under oxidizing conditions (Fig. 1, A and C).Redox-mediated Transition of Monomers/Multimers of FANCA and FANCG Expressed in COS Cells—We next examined whether a redox potential affects monomeric/multimeric change of FANC proteins. COS cells either were transfected with a mammalian vector encoding FANCA or FANCG or were cotransfected with both FANCA and FANCG vectors. Cell lysates were examined for expression of FANCA and FANCG by Western blotting. A stable expression of FANCA was observed regardless of the presence of FANCG (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2). On the other hand, FANCG protein was stably expressed only in the presence of FANCA and was hardly detected without FANCA (Fig. 2A, lane 3 versus lane 4), suggesting that FANCA is necessary for stable expression of FANCG in mammalian cells (25Garcia-Higuera I. Kuang Y. Denham J. D'Andrea A.D. Blood. 2000; 96: 3224-3230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to an in vitro study with purified GST-FANCG (Fig. 1A), FANCA multimers were converted to a monomer following incubation with increasing amounts of DTT (Fig. 2B), suggesting that multimerization of FANCA occurs through intermolecular disulfide linkage(s). FANCA and FANCG in COS cells exist as monomers under reduced conditions (Fig. 2C, lane 1) but are converted to various sizes of multimer(s) under non-reducing conditions (Fig. 2C, lane 2).Fig. 2Multimerization of FANCA and FANCG expressed in COS cells under non-reducing conditions. A, COS cells were transfected with mammalian vector (pcDNA) expressing FLAG-FANCA (lane 1), Myc-FANCG (lane 3), or both (lanes 2 and 4). Cell extracts (60 μg) were prepared from each group of transfected cells, loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and analyzed by Western blotting using either an anti-FANCA (lanes 1 and 2) or anti-FANCG (lanes 3 and 4) antibody. B, transition of FANCA multimers into a monomer in the presence of DTT. Cell extracts from COS cells transfected with FANCA-expressing vector were oxidized on air overnight prior to the addition of increasing amounts of DTT. Samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using an anti-FANCA antibody. C, transition of multimers of FANCA/FANCG proteins into a monomer in the presence of DTT. Cell extracts were prepared from COS cells cotransfected with FANCA and FANCG. Extracts were incubated at 4 °C overnight either in the presence (lane 1) or absence (lane 2) of 10 mm DTT prior to loading onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels and Western analysis. Ku70 was used as an internal control for FANCA and FANCG in cell extracts.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Treatment of Cells with Mitomycin C Also Induces a Multimeric Complex of FANCA and FANCG in Vivo—FANC cells are highly sensitive to MMC, a DNA-damaging agent that primarily induces interstrand cross-link DNA damage but also can cause oxidative damage as well as other types of DNA damages (intrastrand cross-link and monoadduct) (24Pagano G. Youssoufian H. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 26D'Andrea A.D. Grompe M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether MMC treatment also induces a multimeric complex of FANC proteins in vivo. COS cells expressing both FANCA and FANCG were treated for 2 h with either H2O2 or MMC and were examined for multimerization of FANC proteins. Similar to H2O2 treatment, cells treated with MMC induced multimerization of FANCA (Fig. 3A, top). FANCA multimers were converted back to monomers when the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE in the presence of DTT (Fig. 3A, middle). Concomitant analysis of FANCG also showed multimerization of FANCG in response to MMC treatment (Fig. 3B), suggesting that multimerization of both FANCA and FANCG is induced by MMC.Fig. 3COS cells treated with either H2O2 or a DNA-damaging agent (MMC) induced a multimeric complex of FANCA and FANCG in vivo. COS cells cotransfected with FLAG-FANCA- and Myc-FANCG-expressing vectors were treated with an increasing amount of either H2O2 or MMC for 2 h. After harvesting the cells, extracts were prepared and analyzed for multimerization of FANCA (A) or FANCG (B) by SDS-PAGE. Where indicated (A and B, middle panel), 10 mm DTT was added before subjecting the extracts to SDS-PAGE. Ku70 in the bottom panel (A and B) was used as an internal control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)FANCA-FANCG Interaction Is Significantly Enhanced in Response to H2O2 or MMC—Because redox potential affects the multimerization of both FANCA and FANCG, we examined whether it also influences FANCA-FANCG interaction. A stable interaction between FANCA and FANCG was observed in COS cells transfected with FLAG-FANCA and Myc-FANCG (Fig. 4A). Compared with non-treated control cells, COS cells treated with H2O2 induced multimerization of FANCA (Fig. 4B, top, lanes 2–4 versus lanes 5–7) as well as interaction between FANCA and FANCG; the latter was evidenced by a significantly higher amount of FANCG coprecipitated with FANCA in a FLAG-antibody pulldown assay (Fig. 4B, bottom, lanes 2–4 versus lanes 5–7).Fig. 4Interaction between FANCA and FANCG in vivo was significantly stimulated by H2O2 treatment. A, cell extracts (500 μg) prepared from COS cells cotransfected with FLAG-FANCA- and Myc-FANCG-expressing vectors were incubated with an anti-FLAG antibody for 2 h for immunoprecipitation using protein A-Sepharose beads. Proteins bound to the beads were eluted with FLAG peptide and analyzed in the presence of 10 mm DTT for FANCA and FANCG by SDS-PAGE and silver staining (lane 1) and Western blotting using anti-FANCA and anti-FANCG antibodies (lane 2). M represents the lane with protein markers. B, COS cells transfected with FLAG-FANCA- and Myc-FANCG-expressing vectors were either mock-treated (lanes 1–4) or treated with 1 mm H2O2 (lanes 5–7) for 2 h. Cell extracts (50 μg) were incubated with an anti-FLAG antibody (Flag Ab) for immunoprecipitation. Total immunoprecipitates (lanes 2 and 5) were further eluted with FLAG peptide to separate the fraction bound to the beads (lanes 3 and 6) and the eluant (lanes 4 and 7). T, B, and E stand for total immunoprecipitates, fraction bound to the beads, and eluant/unbound fraction, respectively. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using an anti-FANCA (top panel) or anti-FANCG (bottom panel) antibody. In the bottom panel, DTT (10 mm) was added to the sample prior to SDS-PAGE to fairly quantify Myc-FANCG.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Because MMC treatment of cells induced multimerization of FANC proteins (Fig. 3), we also examined whether MMC treatment affected the FANCA-FANCG interaction (Fig. 5). COS cells expressing FLAG-FANCA and Myc-FANCG were treated with either H2O2 or MMC and were examined for coprecipitation of FANCG following immunoprecipitation of FLAG-FANCA using an anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 5). Association of Myc-FANCG with FLAG-FANCA was significantly increased following treatment of cells with either H2O2 or MMC (Fig. 5A, lane 4 versus lanes 5–6). Most, if not all, of the FANCG coprecipitated with FANCA was in a multimerized form of FANCG that migrated at >250 kDa in size in the absence of DTT (Fig. 5B, lanes 5 and 6). We also observed that N-ethylmaleimide treatment abolishes multimerization and interaction of FANCA and FANCG in vitro (data not shown). Together, our results suggest that the FANCA-FANCG interaction may occur through intermolecular disulfide linkage(s) in a oxidative damage-dependent manner.Fig. 5Interaction between FANCA and FANCG is induced in vivo upon treatment with either H2O2 or MMC. COS cells were cotransfected with expression vectors for FLAG-FANCA and Myc-FANCG, and the cells were untreated (A–C, lanes 3 and 4), treated with 1 mm H2O2 (A–C, lane 5), or treated with 1 μm MMC (A–C, lane 6) for 2 h. Cell extracts (200 μg) were incubated with an anti-FLAG antibody (Flag-Ab) for 2 h prior to addition of protein A-Sepharose beads for immunoprecipitation. Lanes 1 and 2 (A–C) contained no cell extracts. Following immunoprecipitation, the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using an anti-FANCG antibody (A and B) or an anti-FANCA antibody (C). For analysis, samples were treated with 10 mm DTT (A) or 0 mm DTT (B and C) for 1 h just before being subjected to SDS-PAGE. In B, ** represents an unidentified band that did not match the monomer form of Myc-FANCG.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONFANC cells exhibit a defect in damage-induced cell cycle arrest, a high level of chromosomal aberrations, and hypersensitivity to DNA-cross-linking agents. FANC mutant cells from groups A, B, C, E, F, and G were defective in forming the FANC protein complex (4Garcia-Higuera I. Kuang Y. Naf D. Wasik J. D'Andrea A.D. Mol. Cell.

A. 1999; 96: 10320-10325Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), suggesting that FANC proteins form a large multiprotein complex that may be necessary for their function in damage signaling and repair. In this study we examined the interaction of FANC proteins in response to oxidative stress. Our study showed that oxidative DNA damage(s) induced multimerization and interaction of FANC proteins that concomitantly occurred with monoubiquitination of FANCD2.Most redox reactions occur at the thiol group of cysteine, the prominent redox-active amino acid in proteins. FANCA and FANCG possess unusually high numbers of cysteines (38 and 16, respectively), although they do not have any cysteine-mediated motifs such as zinc finger, ring finger, etc. All three FANC proteins formed various multimers under oxidizing conditions in both native and denaturing PAGE, suggesting that the formation of the FANC complex is induced upon redox change via intermolecular disulfide linkage(s) between FANC proteins. Many transcription factors and DNA-binding proteins harboring zinc finger motifs are regulated by redox-mediated change at intramolecular disulfide linkage(s) (28Berg J.M. Shi Y. Science. 1996; 271: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar, 29Park J.S. Wang M. Park S.J. Lee S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29075-29080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the control of protein function through the oxidation state of conserved cysteines is also attributed to intermolecular disulfide linkage(s). Glutathione forms a dimer via disulfide linkage upon redox change and is an important cellular defense against oxidative stress (30Thomas J.A. Poland B. Honzatko R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Fos/Jun (31Abate C. Patel L. Rauscher III, F.J. Curran T.

Chem. 1996; 271: 28784-28791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) are the transcription factors that form heterodimers for their function in response to oxidative stress. It should be pointed out, however, that some of the complexes involving disulfide linkage(s), such as gp70-Pr15E interaction, may not be regulated by redox change because the complexes are resistant to treatment with reducing agent(s) (34Opstelten D.J. Wallin M. Garoff H. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6537-6545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given the fact that redox change facilitates physical interaction of FANCA with FANCG, the FANCA-FANCG interaction is likely controlled by intermolecular disulfide linkage(s). Identification of cysteine sites on FANCA and FANCG would be necessary to clarify the roles of the FANCA-FANCG complex in damage signaling and DNA repair"
https://openalex.org/W2029087704,"Human ADAMTS13 was recently identified as a gene encoding von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease, hADAMTS13. Both congenital and acquired defects in this enzyme can cause thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. hADAMTS13 consists of 1,427 amino acid residues and is composed of multiple structural domains including thrombospondin type 1 motifs and CUB domains. To analyze the functional roles of these domains in vivo, we determined the cDNA sequence of the mouse ortholog, mADAMTS13. Unexpectedly, two forms of the mouse Adamts13 gene were isolated that differed in the insertion of an intracisternal A particle (IAP) retrotransposon including a premature stop codon. The IAP insertion was found in BALB/c, C3H/He, C57BL/6, and DBA/2 strains but not in the 129/Sv strain. The outbred ICR strain had either the IAP-free or IAP-inserted allele or both. IAP-free Adamts13 encoded mADAMTS13L, a protein of 1,426 amino acid residues with the same domain organization as hADAMTS13. In contrast, IAP-inserted Adamts13 encoded a C-terminally truncated enzyme, mADAMTS13S, that is comprised of only 1,037 amino acid residues and lacking the C-terminal two thrombospondin type 1 motifs and two CUB domains. Strain specificity was also confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR and Northern blot analyses. Both recombinant mADAMTS13L and mADAMTS13S exhibited von Willebrand factor cleaving activities in vitro.

VWF is mainly synthesized in endothelial cells and secreted into the circulating blood as unusually large VWF (UL-VWF) multimers (1Furlan M. Ann.

If cleavage is impaired, however, UL-VWF multimers accumulate in the plasma. Because UL-VWF multimers possess an extremely high thrombotic activity (4Federici A.B. Bader R. Pagani S. Colibretti M.L.

The importance of VWF proteolysis is best illustrated by the severe consequences of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, a condition associated with increased levels of UL-VWF multimers (6Moake J.L.

However, the biochemical and physiological roles of these domains in vivo remain to be resolved. As a first step to develop suitable animal models for following potential roles of this enzyme in vivo, we have cloned the mouse ortholog of hADAMTS13, mADAMTS13, and determined its complete genomic structure. In the present study, we report two types of the Adamts13 gene in mice caused by the strain-specific insertion of an intracisternal A-particle (IAP) retrotransposon. We further examine the VWF cleaving activity of mADAMTS13. Animals—Male 129/Sv mice were purchased from Clea Japan, Inc. Male BALB/c, C3H/He, C57BL/6, DBA/2, and ICR mice were purchased from Japan SLC, Inc. Blood (∼100 μl) was collected by cardiac puncture into a syringe containing 10 μl of 3.8% sodium citrate and centrifuged to obtain plasma. Spleen and liver were excised, rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, and immediately used for DNA and RNA preparation. DNA Sequencing—All of the sequence analyses were performed by 373A or 3700 automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems) with a BigDye Terminator Kit (Applied Biosystems). Determination of the mADAMTS13 cDNA Sequence—Total RNA was prepared from the livers of C57BL/6 and 129/Sv mice with Isogen (Nippon Gene), and poly(A)+ RNA was purified with an mRNA purification kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The cDNA was synthesized from the poly(A)+ RNA with a first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Amersham Biosciences). PCR was carried out with primers designed from the genomic DNA sequence (forward sequence in 5′-untranslated region, 5′-AGGAAGCTCCCAAGAGTAAACACTGCCT-3′; reverse sequence within the metalloprotease domain, 5′-TCAGAGAGGGTGATTAGCTTCACCAGGT-3′). PCR products were cloned into pCR2.1 vector using a TA Cloning™ kit (Invitrogen) and sequenced. In addition, 3′-RACE was performed using a 3′-Full RACE Core Set (Takara), according to the manufacturer's instructions. After reverse transcription from liver poly(A)+ RNA, PCR was performed using the Adaptor Primer provided with the kit and a gene-specific forward primer within the metalloprotease domain, 5′-TGGAGTTGCCTGATGGCAACCAGCA-3′. The second PCR was performed using the first PCR products as a template with Adaptor Primer and a gene-specific internal forward primer, 5′-CATCACCTTTTCCTACTTTCAACTGAAGCAG-3′. The cycling parameters were as follows: 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 3 min, followed by 72 °C for 7 min. PCR products were cloned into pCR2.1 vector and sequenced. PCR Analysis of IAP Insertion in the Adamts13 Gene—Genomic DNA was extracted from ear punches of 129/Sv, BALB/c, C3H/He, C57BL/6, DBA/2, and ICR mice by DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen). Presence or absence of an IAP insertion in the Adamts13 gene was determined by PCR with HotStarTaq DNA polymerase (Qiagen). The amplification was carried out using mixture of three primers; the intron 23-specific forward primer, 5′-ACCTCTCAAGTGTTTGGGATGCTA-3′, the IAP-specific reverse primer, 5′-TCAGCGCCATCTTGTGACGGCGAA-3′, and the primer downstream of the IAP target site, 5′-TGCCAGATGGCCATGATTAACTCT-3′. PCR products were directly sequenced. Southern Blot Analysis—Genomic DNA prepared from spleens was digested with EcoRV, separated on 0.7% agarose gel, and transferred to a nylon membrane by standard capillary blotting techniques. A genomic fragment (842 bp) upstream of the IAP target site was produced by PCR with the primers 5′-TAGGCAGCCATGGATCTGTATTAG-3′ and 5′-TGTCTGCTCTTCCAGAAATCCTTA-3′ and labeled with fluorescein-11-dUTP using Gene Images random prime labeling module (Amersham Biosciences). The blot was hybridized with the probe, and the hybridized probe was detected using the Antifluorescein-AP conjugate and the CDP-Star detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Chemiluminescence was measured by an LAS-1000plus image analyzer (Fujifilm). Determination of the Adamts13 Genomic Sequence—A λ phage library constructed from Sau3AI-digested genomic DNA of the 129/Sv strain was screened by a PCR-based method as described previously (23Kokame K. Kato H. Miyata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29659-29665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Three independent positive phages were obtained. Each phage insert DNA was subcloned into pBluescript II SK(+) vector (Stratagene) and sequenced using the GPS-1 Genome Priming System (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sequence data were assembled and analyzed using the Sequencher software (Gene Codes). Sequence gaps of each target DNA were filled by primer walking sequencing. Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from the livers of six mouse strains with Isogen (Nippon Gene), and poly(A)+ RNA was purified using PolyATtract mRNA Isolation Systems (Promega) and subjected to one-step RT-PCR (Qiagen). The exon 21/22-specific sense primer (5′-TTGTGGGAGAGGTCTGAAGGAACT-3′), the pseudoexon 24-specific antisense primer (5′-TCAGCGCCATCTTGTGACGGCGAA-3′), and the exon 24/25-specific antisense primer (5′-ACAGGAGACAGAGCACTCTGTCCA-3′) were simultaneously used for the amplification. The PCR products were excised from the agarose gel and sequenced. Northern Blot Analysis—The specific fluorescein-labeled probe (1.3 kb) was synthesized by PCR from mouse Adamts13 cDNA as described previously (23Kokame K. Kato H. Miyata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29659-29665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The primers used were a sense primer located in exon 3 (5′-ATTCTGCACCTGGAACTCCTGGTA-3′) and an antisense primer located in exon 13 (5′-CGGCTGACAATGAAGCTTTCTCCA-3′). Poly(A)+ RNA (10 μg) from mouse livers were separated on 1% agarose gel containing 2% formaldehyde and transferred to a nylon membrane. Hybridization and detection using the Antifluorescein-AP conjugate and the CDP-Star detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences) were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Commercially available premade Northern blot membranes containing poly(A)+ RNA from the BALB/c strain (Multiple Tissue Northern blot; Clontech) and the Swiss Webster strain (FirstChoice Northern blot; Ambion) were also analyzed using the Antifluorescein-HRP conjugate and the DNA Thunder Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Chemiluminescence was measured by an LAS-1000plus image analyzer (Fujifilm). Preparation of Recombinant Substrate (mVWF73) for Enzymatic Assay—To examine the enzymatic activities of mADAMTS13, we prepared the recombinant substrate as described previously (24Kokame K. Matsumoto M. Fujimura Y. Miyata T. Blood. 2004; 103: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In brief, a D1596-T1668 region of mouse VWF was amplified by RT-PCR using total RNA from a C57BL/6 mouse liver. The primers, 5′-cgggatccGACCGGGTAGAGGCACCTAACC-3′ and 5′-cggaattcTCAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGTGTCTGCAGGACCAGGTCAGGA-3′ were used for the amplification. Lowercase letters indicate added restriction enzyme sites, and the underlined sequence is the inserted C-terminal His6 tag (H). The PCR product was digested with BamHI and EcoRI and cloned into the corresponding sites of pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences), a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion expression vector. The resulting plasmid encoding GST-D1596T1668-H was introduced into Escherichia coli, BL21 (Stratagene), and expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. The bacterial cells were collected and lysed with CelLytic B (Sigma), followed by centrifugation. The soluble fraction was subjected to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Spin Kit (Qiagen) and further to a MicroSpin GST purification module (Amersham Biosciences). The purified protein, designated GST-mVWF73-H, was used as substrates for enzymatic assays. The molecular mass of GST-mVWF73-H was 35.7 kDa. If mADAMTS13 cleaves the expected site, the size of the N-terminal portion including the GST tag will be 28.0 kDa. Transient Expression of mADAMTS13—The entire open reading frame (ORF) constructs with C-terminal FLAG sequence (DYKDDDDK) were prepared for two types of mouse ADAMTS13, mADAMTS13L (GenBank™ accession number AB112362) and mADAMTS13S (GenBank™ accession number AB071302), by PCR. Each PCR product was inserted into pCAGG-neo mammalian expression vector (25Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4597) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmids were transfected into HeLa cells using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) as described previously (16Kokame K. Matsumoto M. Soejima K. Yagi H. Ishizashi H. Funato M. Tamai H. Konno M. Kamide K. Kawano Y. Miyata T. Fujimura Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11902-11907Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Forty-eight hours after transfection, the media were collected and concentrated using Centricon YM-30 (Millipore). The cells together with extracellular matrix were lysed in SDS sample buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 2% SDS, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, 0.02% bromphenol blue, 6% glycerol, pH 6.8). Recombinant proteins were detected by SDS-PAGE and Western blot as described previously (16Kokame K. Matsumoto M. Soejima K. Yagi H. Ishizashi H. Funato M. Tamai H. Konno M. Kamide K. Kawano Y. Miyata T. Fujimura Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11902-11907Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). For culture media, a rabbit anti-mADAMTS13 polyclonal antibody (described below) and an HRP-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories) were used for detection after SDS-PAGE under nonreducing condition. For cell lysates, an anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) and an HRP-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories) were used for detection after SDS-PAGE under reducing condition. Chemiluminescence was developed using the Western Lighting Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and detected by an LAS-1000plus image analyzer (Fujifilm). Preparation of Polyclonal Antibody against Mouse ADAMTS13—A polyclonal antiserum against mADAMTS13 was raised by DNA-based immunization protocols. Rabbits were immunized by intradermal injection with ∼1 mg of mADAMTS13S expression plasmid at 25 sites on the back. Booster immunizations were carried out by the same protocol 3 weeks after the primary immunization. Serum was collected 3 weeks after the second immunization. The IgG fraction was then prepared by an affinity chromatography using a protein G column (Amersham Biosciences). Enzymatic Assay—Purified GST-mVWF73-H (500 ng) was incubated with recombinant mADAMTS13L or mADAMTS13S in 40 μl of reaction buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm BaCl2, 0.01% Tween 20, and 1 mm p-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, pH 8.0) at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by adding 10 μl of SDS sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 10% SDS, 250 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 30% glycerol, pH 6.8). The samples were subjected to Western blot using a rabbit anti-GST antibody (Molecular Probes) and an HRP-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories) as described (24Kokame K. Matsumoto M. Fujimura Y. Miyata T. Blood. 2004; 103: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). We also analyzed the proteolytic activity of plasma from five mouse strains in the same way. Identification of Adamts13 in the C57BL/6 Strain—To identify the orthologous mouse gene of human ADAMTS13, we performed a BLAST search in the public data base, based on the human ADAMTS13 cDNA sequence (GenBank™ accession number AB069698, 4,284-nucleotide ORF) reported by Soejima et al. (8Soejima K. Mimura N. Hirashima M. Maeda H. Hamamoto T. Nakagaki T. Nozaki C. J. Biochem. 2001; 130: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). This search led us to identify a compatible genomic sequence (GenBank™ accession number AC090008) derived from the C57BL/6 strain. This sequence was located on chromosome 2, band A3 and contained 29 conserved exons similar to human ADAMTS13. To obtain the cDNA to corresponding mRNA, we performed RT-PCR and 3′-RACE using poly(A)+ RNA from the liver of a C57BL/6 mouse. Unexpectedly, the cDNA sequence (GenBank™ accession number AB071302) included only a 3,114-nucleotide ORF derived from 24 exons. From a comparison between the cDNA and the genomic sequences of the C57BL/6 strain, we found a 6-kb retrovirus-like sequence in intron 23 of the Adamts13 gene (Fig. 1). This sequence was flanked by the identical 338-bp sequence with a 6-bp (CACTAG) duplication of target site, as is often observed for retrotransposition. A BLAST search identified the insertional element as an intracisternal A-particle (IAP), which is one of the retrotransposons present at about 2,000 sites in the mouse genome (26Kuff E.L. Lueders K.K. Adv. Cancer Res. 1988; 51: 183-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). This insertion of IAP seemed to be responsible for loss of the original mRNA 3′-end by splicing exon 23 to pseudo-exon 24 that contains a premature stop codon. Identification of Adamts13 in the 129/Sv Strain—To determine whether the IAP insertion into the Adamts13 gene is common to a variety of mouse strains, we carried out PCR genotyping of five inbred and one outbred strains (Fig. 2A). A mixture of three primers was used for the reaction; Primers F and R1 were designed to produce a 305-bp band in the absence of IAP, and primers F and R2 were designed to produce a 230-bp band in the presence of IAP. This experiment revealed that the IAP insertion was present in the BALB/c, C3H/He, and DBA/2 strains but not in the129/Sv strain (Fig. 2B). The outbred ICR strain was genetically heterogeneous with respect to the IAP insertion into the Adamts13 gene. Southern blot analysis using probes upstream of the IAP target site revealed that Adamts13 was a single copy gene and confirmed the strain-specific insertion of IAP (Fig. 2C). These results implied that the Adamts13 gene transcript of the 129/Sv mice and some ICR mice might contain residual exons lost in the other mouse strains. To confirm this hypothesis, RT-PCR was performed using liver poly(A)+ RNA from a 129/Sv mouse. The obtained sequences indicated that the Adamts13 cDNA (GenBank™ accession number AB112362) contained a 4,281-nucleotide ORF similar to human ADAMTS13 (4,284-nucleotide ORF). To determine the complete genomic sequence of Adamts13 in the 129/Sv strain, we screened a 129/Sv mouse λ genomic library. Sequence analysis of positive phage clones confirmed the absence of IAP in the Adamts13 gene. Adamts13 in the 129/Sv strain (GenBank™ accession number AB095445) contained 29 exons like human ADAMTS13 and spanned ∼30 kb. To examine the effect of IAP on Adamts13 mRNA splicing, RT-PCR was performed using liver poly(A)+ RNA from six mouse strains (Fig. 3). The exon 21/22-specific sense primer, the exon 24/25-specific antisense primer, and the pseudo-exon 24-specific antisense primer were mixed and used for the amplification. We detected the IAP chimeric transcript in four inbred strains with the IAP insertion. In contrast, the IAP-free transcript was observed in the 129/Sv strain. The heterogeneous expression of two types of transcripts was observed in samples from the ICR strain. To characterize the transcripts in more detail, Northern blot analysis of liver RNA was carried out using a 1.3-kb probe spanning exons 3–13 of Adamts13 cDNA (Fig. 4A). The RNA was prepared from the same animals as used for the Southern blot analysis. An ∼3.5-kb mRNA corresponding to the size of IAP chimeric transcript was detected in the C57BL/6 and the ICR strains. The IAP-free transcript of ∼5.0 kb was observed in the 129/Sv and the ICR strains.Fig. 4Northern blot analysis of mouse Adamts13 mRNA. A, expression of Adamts13 mRNA in liver. Poly(A)+ RNA isolated from liver of indicated strains was probed with a 1.3-kb Adamts13 cDNA corresponding to exons 3–13. The approximate sizes of the IAP-free (5.0 kb) and the IAP chimeric (3.5 kb) transcripts are indicated by arrowheads. B, expression of Adamts13 mRNA in tissues from BALB/c mice. C, expression of Adamts13 mRNA in tissues from SwissWebster mice. The sizes of RNA markers are shown at the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Thus, these results clearly indicate the presence of two types of mouse Adamts13 in a strain-specific manner (Fig. 5). Adamts13 of the 129/Sv strain encodes an ADAMTS13 protein containing 1,426 amino acid residues with the same domain structure as hADAMTS13, designated mADAMTS13L. Adamts13 of the BALB/c, C3H/He, C57BL/6, and DBA/2 strains encodes the shorter ADAMTS13 protein including only 1,037 amino acid residues, designated mADAMTS13S. In this protein, the C-terminal two TSP1 and two CUB domains are replaced with the 16-amino acid sequence, ALVWEAAPTFAVTRWR, derived from the IAP. The outbred ICR strain carries either the IAP-free or IAP-inserted allele or both. Expression of the Adamts13 mRNA in Mouse Tissues—To study the expression pattern of the mouse Adamts13 gene, we analyzed Northern blots containing poly(A)+ RNA from various tissues of the BALB/c and the Swiss Webster strains. As shown in Fig. 4 (B and C), Adamts13 mRNA in both strains was exclusively observed in the liver, suggesting that mADAMTS13 is primarily synthesized in the liver, similar to hADAMTS13. A single transcript of 3.5 kb was expressed in liver of the BALB/c strain with the IAP insertion. In contrast, two transcripts of 5.0 and 3.5 kb were detected in liver of the outbred Swiss Webster strain, suggesting that this strain may carry two types of alleles, like the ICR strain. Both SwissWebster and ICR strains are derived from a colony of Swiss mice. Comparison of the Deduced Amino Acid Sequences of mADAMTS13 and hADAMTS13—The deduced amino acid sequences of mouse and human ADAMTS13 were aligned (Fig. 6). The overall sequence identity between mADAMTS13L and hADAMTS13 was ∼70%. The highest identity (>80%) was observed in the disintegrin-like (81%), TSP1–1 (89%), cysteinerich (80%), and TSP1–8 (83%) domains, whereas relatively low conservation (<60%) was observed in the signal peptide (43%), propeptide (52%), TSP1–4 (46%), and TSP1–6 (40%) domains. mADAMTS13L contained eight potential N-glycosylation sites, six of which were conserved in hADAMTS13. mADAMTS13L also included several motifs characteristic for each domain of hADAMTS13, such as a furin cleavage sequence at the end of the propeptide, a zinc-binding site in the metalloprotease domain, and an RGD sequence in the cysteine-rich domain. The sequences of mADAMTS13L and mADAMTS13S were almost identical, except for the deletion of C-terminal regions. Expression and Enzymatic Activity of Recombinant mADAMTS13L and mADAMTS13S—We transiently expressed the mADAMTS13L and mADAMTS13S proteins in HeLa cells. Western blot analysis using a polyclonal antibody against mADAMTS13 revealed that both were secreted into the culture media (Fig. 7A). Transient expression of mADAMTS13L produced an immunoreactive band of ∼200 kDa, and mADAMTS13S exhibited a 130-kDa band. The level of mADAMTS13S in the medium was almost 10-fold higher than that of mADAMTS13L. This was not due to a preferential accumulation of mADAMTS13L on the cell surface or the extracellular matrix, because a relatively high amount of mADAMTS13S was also observed in the cell lysates (Fig. 7B). It was conceivable that mADAMTS13S was effectively synthesized in HeLa cells compared with mADAMTS13L in our experimental conditions. Whether mADAMTS13S is also preferentially expressed in vivo remains unknown. Further analysis is required to determine the plasma levels of mADAMTS13L and mADAMTS13S in mice. The VWF cleaving activities of recombinant proteins were measured by the degradation of the specific recombinant substrate, GST-mVWF73-H. The relative concentration of recombinant mADAMTS13 in the culture medium was determined by chemiluminescent intensities on Western blot, and equal amounts were used for the enzymatic assay. The substrate, GST-mVWF73-H, was incubated with serial dilutions of the culture medium, and the cleavage product including the N-terminal GST tag was visualized by Western blot using anti-GST (Fig. 8). When the substrate was incubated with the medium of mADAMTS13L-transfected cells, a band appeared with the expected size of the N-terminal portion (28 kDa) in a concentration-dependent manner, indicating the cleaving activity of recombinant mADAMTS13L (Fig. 8A). No degradation was observed after the incubation of GST-mVWF73-H with the medium from untransfected cells. The cleaved band was also detected after incubation with the mADAMTS13S culture medium, and the chemiluminescent intensities of the product bands were almost equal to those obtained by mADAMTS13L (Fig. 8A). We confirmed that the degradation of GST-mVWF73-H by mADAMTS13 was also time-dependent, and the rate of the product formation by mADAMTS13S was similar to that by mADAMTS13L (Fig. 8B). The VWF Cleaving Activity of Mouse Plasma—To examine the ADAMTS13 activity in plasma from various mouse strains, we collected plasma samples from five strains and carried out the enzymatic assay using GST-mVWF73-H. As shown in Fig. 9, plasma from all strains cleaved GST-mVWF73-H. Comparison of the product levels did not reveal a significant difference among strains. This suggested that the IAP insertion into the Adamts13 gene does not affect the in vitro cleavage of GST-mVWF73-H by plasma. In this study, we identified two isoforms of the mouse Adamts13 gene that result from the strain-specific insertion of an IAP-retrotransposon. The IAP-free Adamts13 gene contained 29 exons, and the deduced protein sequence included 1,426 amino acid residues with the same domain organization as hADAMTS13. In contrast, the IAP-inserted Adamts13 gene contained only 24 exons encoding 1,037 amino acids having a truncated C terminus. The inserted IAP is one of the endogenous transposable elements, which is closely related to retroviruses and transposed via the reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate (26Kuff E.L. Lueders K.K. Adv. Cancer Res. 1988; 51: 183-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 27Keshet E. Schiff R. Itin A. Adv. Cancer Res. 1991; 56: 215-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The IAP element contains two long terminal repeats with the signals for the initiation/regulation of transcription and for the polyadenylation of transcripts (28Lamb B.T. Satyamoorthy K. Solter D. Basu A. Xu M.Q. Weinmann R. Howe C.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4824-4833Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). IAP insertions into introns have been shown to cause formation of chimeric transcripts (29Vasicek T.J. Zeng L. Guan X.-J. Zhang T. Costantini F. Tilghman S.M. Genetics. 1997; 147: 777-786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Gwynn B. Lueders K. Sands M.S. Birkenmeier E.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6474-6481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Johnson K.R.

Heidmann T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31068-31075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), similar to our findings in the Adamts13 gene. We noted that the presence of IAP in the Adamts13 gene induces the appearance of a cryptic splicing site followed by a premature in-frame stop codon and a polyadenylation signal derived from the IAP long terminal repeat. As a result, the insertion leads to replacement of the last 405 amino acid residues corresponding to two TSP1 motifs and two CUB domains with the IAP-encoded 16 amino acid residues. Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses confirmed that the IAP chimeric short transcript (3.5 kb) and the IAP-free long transcript (5 kb) were expressed in a strain-specific manner. Both types of transcripts were specifically expressed in the liver, consistent with expression of the human ADAMTS13 gene. It should be noted that the IAP insertion could not completely abolish the formation of mADAMTS13L mRNA. The RT-PCR products (540-bp; Fig. 3) characteristic of mADAMTS13L mRNA were also detectable in the strains with the IAP insertion when using a large amount of template (data not shown). A small amount of mADAMTS13L protein may be expressed in mice with the IAP-inserted Adamts13 gene such as the BALB/c, C3H/He, C57BL/6, and DBA/2 strains. Incidentally, the RT-PCR and 3′-RACE data did not show any splicing variants that encoded mADAMTS13S-like protein in the IAP-free strains. Recently, we developed a novel recombinant substrate, GST-VWF73-H, to measure hADAMTS13 activity (24Kokame K. Matsumoto M. Fujimura Y. Miyata T. Blood. 2004; 103: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). GST-VWF73-H is a partial region of human VWF flanked by GST and His6 tags. Because of difficulty in isolating VWF from mouse plasma, we have also prepared the recombinant substrate, GST-mVWF73-H, based on the mouse VWF cDNA sequence. Both mouse and human plasma efficiently cleaved GST-mVWF73-H and produced a fragment of the expected size. Mouse plasma also cleaved the substrate for hADAMTS13, GST-VWF73-H (data not shown). Both recombinant mADAMTS13L and mADAMTS13S were secreted into the culture medium of HeLa cells. This result indicates that the IAP insertion does not abolish secretion of mADAMTS13 from cells. The recombinant mADAMTS13L and mADAMTS13S cleaved GST-mVWF73-H with nearly the same efficiency. Similarly, a deletion mutant of hADAMTS13 in mimicry of mADAMTS13S was also secreted efficiently from HeLa cells and cleaved GST-VWF73-H with normal activity (data not shown). In previous reports, we and others found that deletion mutants of hADAMTS13 devoid of the C-terminal TSP1 motifs and CUB domains retained VWF cleaving activity (21Soejima K. Matsumoto M. Kokame K. Yagi H. Ishizashi H. Maeda H. Nozaki C. Miyata T. Fujimura Y. Nakagaki T. Blood. 2003; 102: 3232-3237Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 22Zheng X. Nishio K. Majerus E.M. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30136-30141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Therefore, our current observation on mouse and human recombinant proteins was consistent with these previous studies. Moreover, the plasma VWF cleaving activities in mice were also comparable among the strains with or without the IAP insertion in the Adamts13 gene. The C-terminal two TSP1 motifs and two CUB domains of mADAMTS13 may contribute to activity but are not essential for the VWF cleavage, at least in vitro. The fact that several common strains of mice have a naturally truncated form of ADAMTS13 allows us to hypothesize that the truncated domains are not necessary in vivo. However, several mutations in TSP1–7, TSP1–8, CUB-1, and CUB-2 domains of hADAMTS13 were reported to associate with congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (15Levy G.G. Nichols W.C. Lian E.C.

It is still unclear whether these mutants are secreted from cells, as is the case with mADAMTS13S. To date, two mutations, R1123C and 4143insA, were characterized by expression analysis, and both impaired secretion of the enzyme from cells (19Matsumoto M. Kokame K. Soejima K. Miura M. Hayashi S.

Bernardo et al. (33Bernardo A. Nolasco L. Ball C. Moake J. Lopez J. Dong J.-F. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2003; 1: 405aGoogle Scholar) reported that several short peptides within the regions from TSP1–6 to the C terminus of hAD-AMTS13 block VWF cleavage on the endothelial cell surface under flow conditions. This finding suggests an important role for the C-terminal domains in vivo. Although our results clearly show that the mouse has managed without full-length ADAMTS13, the relative importance of ADAMTS13 for regulation of VWF activity may be different between human and mouse. A gene targeting technique of mouse Adamts13 will help to clarify the physiological contribution of mADAMTS13.

https://openalex.org/W2065379155,"Residues 386–423 of the rat brain serotonin transporter (SERT) are predicted to form a hydrophilic loop connecting transmembrane spans 7 and 8 (extracellular loop 4 or EL4). EL4 has been hypothesized to play a role in conformational changes associated with substrate translocation. To more fully investigate EL4 structure and function, we performed cysteine-scanning mutagenesis and methanethiosulfonate (MTS) accessibility studies on these 38 residues. Four EL4 mutants (M386C, R390C, G402C, and L405C) showed very low transport activities, low cell surface expression, and strong inhibition by MTS reagents, indicating high structural and functional importance. Twelve mutants were sensitive to very low MTS concentrations, indicating positions highly exposed to the aqueous environment. Eleven mutants were MTS-insensitive, indicating positions that were either buried in EL4 structure or functionally unimportant. The patterns of sensitivity to mutation and MTS reagents were used to produce a structural model of EL4. Positions 386–399 and 409–421 are proposed to form α-helices, connected by nine consecutive MTS-sensitive positions, within which four positions, 402–405, may form a turn or hinge. The presence of serotonin changed the MTS accessibility of cysteines at nine positions, while cocaine, a non-transportable blocker, did not affect accessibility. Serotonin-induced accessibility changes required both Na+ and Cl–, indicating that they were associated with active substrate translocation. With the exception of a single mutant, F407C, neither mutation to cysteine nor treatment with MTS reagents affected SERT affinities for serotonin or the cocaine analog β-CIT. These studies support the role of EL4 in conformational changes occurring during translocation and show that it does not play a direct role in serotonin binding.

During chemical neurotransmission, neurotransmitters are released into the synaptic cleft, then taken back up into the presynaptic cell. This re-uptake is catalyzed by a large, highly homologous family of membrane transport proteins known as the neurotransmitter/sodium symporter (NSS) 1The abbreviations used are: NSS, neurotransmitter/sodium symporter; SERT, serotonin transporter; TM, transmembrane; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; NHS-SS, sulfosuccinimidyl-2-(biotinamido)ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate; MTS, methanethiosulfonate; MTSET, [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methanethiosulfonate bromide; MTSES, sodium (2-sulfonatoethyl) methanethiosulfonate; MTSEA, N-biotinaminoethyl methanethiosulfonate; 5HT, serotonin; DAT, dopamine transporter; β-CIT, 2β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4-125I-iodophenyl)-tropane; EL, extracellular loop; NET, norepinephrine transporter; GAT, γ-aminobutyric acid transporter. family (1Saier Jr., M.H. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; : 84-94Google Scholar). The NSS transporters couple the uptake of specific neurotransmitters and/or amino acids to the transmembrane gradients of Na+, Cl–, and in some cases, K+ or H+ (for a recent review, see Ref. 2Torres G.E. Gainetdinov R.R. Caron M.G. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 13-25Google Scholar). Within this family, the closely related biogenic amine subfamily is responsible for the re-uptake of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine. These transporters are the targets of antidepressants, cocaine, and amphetamines in the brain (3Kuhar M.J. Ritz M.C. Boja J.W. Trends Neurosci. 1991; 14: 299-302Google Scholar, 4Langer S.Z. Schoemaker H. Prog. Neuropsychopharmacol. Biol. Psychiat. 1988; 12: 193-216Google Scholar). The high sequence homology among the NSS transporters suggests a common architecture, predicted to consist of 12 membrane spanning α-helices. This general topology has been confirmed experimentally for the serotonin transporter (SERT) (5Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1479-1486Google Scholar, 6Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12675-12681Google Scholar, 7Androutsellis-Theotokis A. Ghassemi F. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45933-45938Google Scholar, 8Androutsellis-Theotokis A. Rudnick G. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8370-8378Google Scholar). However, the three-dimensional packing of these membrane spans is still largely unknown, as is the molecular mechanism by which these transporters bind and translocate their substrates. Much recent work has focused on the TM7-EL4-TM8 region of the transporters. Gether and co-workers (9Norregaard L. Frederiksen D. Nielsen E.O. Gether U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4266-4273Google Scholar, 10Loland C.J. Norregaard L. Gether U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36928-36934Google Scholar, 11Norregaard L. Visiers I. Loland C.J. Ballesteros J. Weinstein H. Gether U. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15836-15846Google Scholar) have shown that the dopamine transporter (DAT) contains an endogenous Zn2+ binding site made up of two residues from EL4: His-375 near the top of TM7, Glu-396 near the top of TM8, and one residue from EL2, His-193. These three residues coordinate Zn2+ with micromolar affinity, inhibiting dopamine transport. However, Zn2+ binding does not prevent binding of the competitive inhibitor WIN 35,428, suggesting that Zn2+ does not inhibit by blocking the substrate binding site. These results lead to two conclusions: 1) TM7 and TM8 must lie very close together, because the average distance between Zn2+ binding coordinates in binding sites of known three-dimensional structure is 4 Å (12Glusker J.P. Anfinson C.B. Richards F.M. Eisenberg D.S. Advances in Protein Chemistry, Metalloproteins: Structural Aspects. 42. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1991: 3-66Google Scholar), and 2) EL4 is not likely to be involved in substrate binding. Originally it was thought that Zn2+ inhibited transport by preventing movements of TM7 and TM8 relative to one another. However, more recent studies have shown that Zn2+ inhibits dopamine transport indirectly, by promoting a conformation of DAT that carries a large, uncoupled Cl– conductance. In the absence of voltage clamping, as in unclamped oocytes or in cultured cells, this conductance is large enough to dissipate the driving force for dopamine uptake and inhibit transport. In voltage-clamped oocytes, where the driving force is maintained, Zn2+ binding does not inhibit uptake by DAT (13Meinild A.K. Sitte H.H. Gether U. Annual Meeting of the Society for Neuroscience. New Orleans, LA, 2003Google Scholar). The finding that Zn2+ binding at EL4 opens an abnormal ion conductance suggests that changes in EL4 structure can have profound effects on the overall conformation of the transporter. In order to more fully investigate the role of EL4 in NSS transporter function, we have performed cysteine-scanning mutagenesis and methanethiosulfonate (MTS) accessibility studies on the entire predicted loop in SERT. Our results strongly support the conclusion that EL4 is not directly involved in substrate binding. We have also engineered an inhibitory Zn2+ binding site into SERT, demonstrating that the close apposition of TM7 and TM8 is a common feature of the structures of the transporters, and reinforcing the idea that this region has strong effects on overall conformation. These results have allowed us to construct a hypothetical structural model for EL4. We have also identified a number of functionally important positions whose accessibility changes when the transporter is actively translocating serotonin, demonstrating a high level of conformational activity in this loop. Materials—Plasmid DNA was prepared using Qiagen midiprep kits, and restriction fragments were purified from agarose gels using the QiaQuick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The cocaine analog β-CIT (2β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4-iodophenyl)-tropane) was obtained from the Chemical Synthesis and Drug Supply Program of the National Institute of Mental Health. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. unless otherwise indicated. Construction of EL4 Cysteine Mutants—All mutants were made in a parent construct containing an alanine mutation at position Cys-109, which lies in extracellular loop 1. Cys-109 is the major extracellular determinant of sensitivity to hydrophilic MTS reagents in SERT (5Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1479-1486Google Scholar). The C109A parent construct was insensitive to both MTSET ([2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methanethiosulfonate bromide) and MTSES (sodium (2-sulfonatoethyl) methanethiosulfonate) up to the highest concentration used in this study (20 mm, results not shown). In all other respects, the functional activities of the C109A mutant are very similar to wild-type SERT (5Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1479-1486Google Scholar). The C109A construct also contained a c-Myc epitope tag at the N terminus, and a polyhistidine sequence and FLAG epitope tag at the C terminus, in order to facilitate determination of cell surface expression (Ref. 14Tate C.G. Blakely R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26303-26310Google Scholar and see below). The EL4 cysteine mutants were produced using the PCR-based megaprimer method (15Aiyar A. Leis J. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 366-369Google Scholar, 16Barik S. Galinski M.S. BioTechniques. 1991; 10: 489-490Google Scholar, 17Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407Google Scholar). Our use of this method has been described in detail elsewhere (18Penado K.M. Rudnick G. Stephan M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28098-28106Google Scholar, 19Visiers I. Weinstein H. Rudnick G. Stephan M.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6784-6793Google Scholar). After mutagenesis, the resulting PCR fragment was cut with appropriate restriction enzymes and subcloned back into the wild-type expression plasmid. Each mutant plasmid was screened for the presence or absence of silent restriction sites included in the mutagenic primers, indicating the presence or absence of the desired mutations. All mutants were sequenced in both directions between the subcloning sites to confirm the presence of the desired mutations and to ensure that no extraneous mutations had been incorporated during the PCR reactions. Expression of Mutant SERTs—The expression system used has been described in detail elsewhere (20Elroy-Stein O. Fuerst T.R. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6126-6130Google Scholar, 21Blakely R.D. Clark J.A. Rudnick G. Amara S.G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 302-308Google Scholar). Briefly, the expression plasmid pRSTagM contains a promoter for T7 RNA polymerase upstream from the rat brain SERT cDNA. This promoter was used to express wild-type and mutant SERTs in the vaccinia/T7 polymerase/HeLa cell system. HeLa cells were plated in 96-well plates (Wallac Isoplate TC; Wallac Oy, Turku, Finland) at 50% confluency and allowed to grow overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate (Invitrogen). The next day they were infected with a vaccinia virus strain, VTF7-3, which makes T7 RNA polymerase (added to the cells in 20 μl/well DMEM without serum). After a 15-min incubation with the virus at 37 °C, the cells were transiently transfected with wild-type and mutant plasmids (170 ng of plasmid DNA and 0.35 μl of lipofectin (Invitrogen) per well in 40 μl of DMEM without serum). Wild-type SERT, no plasmid (mock-transfected) controls, and mutants were each transfected in duplicate or triplicate wells. Transport Assays—[3H]serotonin transport assays were carried out the next day between 19 and 24 h postinfection. For the standard assay, cells were washed twice with 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, and 1.4 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.3) containing 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 (PBSCM). Transport was measured by incubating the cells with 14.6 nm [1,2-3H(N)]serotonin (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 40 μl of PBSCM for 20 min at room temperature. The cells were washed three times with 100 μl of ice-cold PBS and lysed in 30 μl of 0.1 n NaOH for 30 min. Then 220 μl of Optifluor (Packard Instrument Co., Meriden, CT) was added per well, the plates were sealed, mixed well by shaking, and counted in a Wallac Microbeta 1450 microplate counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Downer's Grove, IL). Binding Assays—Binding of the cocaine analog β-CIT (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was also measured using whole cells in 96-well plates. Each well was incubated with 40 μl of PBSCM containing 0.08 nm125I-β-CIT, mixed with increasing concentrations of unlabeled β-CIT. Binding was allowed to proceed for 1.5 h at room temperature with gentle rocking. Unbound β-CIT was removed by washing the wells 3× with 100 μl of ice-cold PBS, and then the cells were lysed and the plates counted as for transport assays. The binding affinity (KD) and maximal binding capacity (Bmax) for β-CIT were determined for each mutant by fitting the binding curves using the Origin program (MicroCal Software; Northampton, MA). Serotonin affinity was measured by the displacement of 125I-β-CIT binding from whole cells. Assays were performed exactly as for the β-CIT curves, except that increasing amounts of serotonin were added to each well together with a constant concentration of radiolabeled β-CIT (0.08 nm). Under the conditions used, where the concentration of β-CIT is below its KD, the concentration at which half the β-CIT is displaced by serotonin (KI) represents the affinity for serotonin. The KI was determined by fitting the inhibition curves using the Origin program. For both assays, the values reported in Table II represent the mean and S.D. of 2–4 separate assays for each mutant.Table IIEffects of cysteine mutation and MTS treatment on MTS sensitive EL4 cysteine mutantsaTreated with MTSES. All others were treated with MTSET.bThe only significant changes in binding parameters. Open table in a new tab aTreated with MTSES. All others were treated with MTSET. bThe only significant changes in binding parameters. MTSET and MTSES Sensitivity Assays—The MTSET and MTSES sensitivities of the mutants were measured by pretreating the cells with varying concentrations of these reagents. Cells were washed as for the transport assays, then the second wash was removed and replaced with 45 μl of PBSCM. MTS reagents (5 μl) were added at 10× the desired final concentrations. MTS reagents were weighed out fresh for each experiment and diluted in distilled-deionized H2O just before using. After 10 min of reaction at room temperature, the cells were washed three times with 100 μl of PBSCM, then assayed for transport or binding as described. Rate constants for MTS inactivation were calculated from the midpoint of the inactivation curves (50% of maximal inactivation). At this concentration, the preset time of inactivation (10 min) represents the half-time for the process (t½), assuming first order kinetics. Dividing the natural log of 2 (0.693) by this time gives the first order rate constant, v (in reciprocal time units) at that concentration of reagent (R). Dividing the rate constant by the concentration (v/R) gives the second order rate constant in units of reciprocal concentration × reciprocal time (m–1 min–1). For serotonin or cocaine protection experiments, cells were washed as above, then preincubated with 10 μm serotonin or cocaine for 10 min in 45 μl of PBSCM, followed by the further addition of 5 μl 10× MTS reagent. After 10 min, the cells were washed three times with 100 μlof PBSCM, allowed to incubate for 10 min in the third wash, and then subjected to three more washes with 100 μl of PBSCM to ensure that all of the residual serotonin or cocaine was removed. Control wells that did not receive MTS reagents, serotonin, or cocaine were subjected to the same washes. When the ionic conditions were varied, stock solutions of serotonin and cocaine were diluted in buffer containing 8.6 mm K2HPO4, 2.8 mm KH2PO4, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, plus either 150 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine chloride (NMDG), 150 mm sodium isethionate or 150 mm NaCl. Control wells were subjected to the same ionic conditions in the absence of serotonin, cocaine, or MTS reagents. Inhibition of Transport by Zn2+—As Zn2+ forms an insoluble salt in the presence of phosphate, PBSCM was replaced with Zn2+ assay buffer (15 mm HEPES (pH 7.1), 120 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2 and 0.1 mm CaCl2). Prior to the assay, the cells were washed once with 100 μl of Zn2+ assay buffer and then pretreated with varying concentrations of Zn2+ in 100 μl of the same buffer for 10 min at room temperature. Transport assays were performed as described above in the continued presence of the same concentrations of Zn2+, replacing PBSCM or PBS with Zn2+ assay buffer at all steps. Biotinylation Assays for Cysteine Accessibility and Determination of Total Cell Surface Expression—Cells expressing the EL4 cysteine mutants were treated with N-biotinaminoethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSEA-biotin; Toronto Research Chemicals, North York, Ontario, Canada) to measure the accessibility of introduced cysteines or with sulfosuccinimidyl-2-(biotinamido)ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate (NHS-SS-biotin; Pierce Chemical Co.) to measure total cell surface expression. The biotinylation reactions were performed on cells in 24-well plates, run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose as previously described (19Visiers I. Weinstein H. Rudnick G. Stephan M.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6784-6793Google Scholar). Wild-type SERT and mutant transporters were detected in the mixture of biotinylated proteins using polyclonal anti-FLAG antibody (Affinity Bioreagents; Golden, CO). Blots were incubated with 1 μg/ml anti-FLAG in blocking buffer (10% nonfat dry milk, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) overnight at 4 °C., washed, and then further incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate in blocking buffer at room temperature (Pierce Chemical Co.). After further washing, bands were detected by chemiluminescence using Super Signal West Femto detection reagent (Pierce Chemical Co.). We used site-directed mutagenesis to substitute single cysteines into each of 38 residue positions in rat brain SERT, corresponding to Met-386 through Phe-423. The mutant SERTs were expressed and functionally characterized using the HeLa cell-vaccinia virus-T7 polymerase transient expression system (20Elroy-Stein O. Fuerst T.R. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6126-6130Google Scholar, 21Blakely R.D. Clark J.A. Rudnick G. Amara S.G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 302-308Google Scholar). Transport Activity—The 38 cysteine mutants were first tested for their abilities to transport [3H]serotonin. As shown in Fig. 1A, many of the mutants showed transport activities similar to the parent construct (60–100% of C109A). Five mutants showed very low transport activities (less than 20% of C109A): M386C, A387C, R390C, G402C, and L405C. While the activities of these mutants were low, they were high enough above background to measure the effects of MTS reagents, and thus were included in further analyses (see below). Six other mutants showed less serious defects in transport activity (30–60% of C109A): V394C, V397C, D400C, I408C, E412C, and P418C. Effects of MTS Reagents—The EL4 cysteine mutants were probed with the hydrophilic, membrane-impermeant MTS reagents MTSET and MTSES. HeLa cells expressing the mutant transporters were preincubated with these reagents at concentrations ranging from 0.0005 to 20 mm for 10 min at room temperature. The reagents were washed away, and [3H]serotonin uptake was measured. Uptake was compared with control wells expressing the same mutants and subjected to the same incubation and washes without MTS reagents. After obtaining a general idea of the relative sensitivity of each mutant, full inhibition curves were obtained (representative curves are shown in Fig. 2). The k½ values derived from these curves were used to calculate second order rate constants, as a measure of the relative rate of reaction at each position (Fig. 1B and see “Experimental Procedures”). The rate constants varied considerably, from very rapid (49,500 m–1 min–1 for R390C) to very slow (4.3 m–1 min–1 for L406C; note the logarithmic scale of the y axis). Mutants that were insensitive up to 20 mm reagent are shown in Fig. 1B to have rate constants below 2 m–1 min–1 (e.g. E388C). Fig. 1C shows the residual activity for each mutant, at a saturating concentration of MTSET or MTSES, also determined from the MTS concentration curves. Some mutants were completely inactivated (0% residual activity), while others, for example, A387C, M389C, and D400C, retained a high fraction of activity after reaction with a saturating concentration of MTS reagent (Fig. 2). Insensitive mutants (at 20 mm reagent) are shown with a residual activity of 100% (e.g. E388C). Only one mutant, M386C, showed a marked enhancement after MTS treatment. While MTSET reaction led to complete inactivation at this position, MTSES reaction stimulated activity by 200%, to about 27% of C109A activity. It is highly unlikely that the MTS sensitivity observed in the EL4 cysteine mutants was due to the exposure of endogenous cysteines. Previous experience with SERT in ours and other laboratories has shown that the only native cysteine that becomes exposed when mutations are made at other sites is Cys-109 (22Kamdar G. Penado K.M. Rudnick G. Stephan M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4038-4045Google Scholar), which has been replaced with alanine in these constructs. In addition, we tested non-cysteine mutations at two functionally important positions in EL4, Arg-390 and Glu-412, for their effects on MTS sensitivity. Even though these mutations, R390E and E412R, were fairly disruptive to SERT structure (reducing transport activity to about 30% of C109A), neither resulted in detectable MTS sensitivity (results not shown). Mutants with Differential Responses to MTSET and MTSES— Most EL4 mutants were either sensitive to both MTSET and MTSES, showing similar rates of reaction, or insensitive to both reagents (Fig. 1, B and C). However, a few mutants were sensitive to one reagent but not the other. Six mutants were sensitive to MTSET but not to MTSES: S395C, K399C, A401C, L406C, I408C, and A419C. Two mutants were sensitive to MTSES but not to MTSET: A387C and M389C. There are two possible explanations for these results: either these positions are only accessible to one reagent (because of local geometry or electrostatic conditions) or they are accessible to both reagents, but only one has an effect on SERT activity. We were able to distinguish between lack of reaction, and reaction without effect on activity, for six of these eight mutants by treating them sequentially with the two reagents (Fig. 3). For example, I408C, which was sensitive to MTSET but not MTSES, was treated first with MTSES. The MTSES was washed away, and MTSET was added and then also washed away, and [3H]serotonin uptake was measured. As Fig. 3 shows, preincubation with MTSES completely protected I408C from subsequent reaction with MTSET. This result indicates that MTSES reacts at this position, preventing further reaction with MTSET, but that the addition of the MTSES moiety had no effect on SERT activity. Similar results were obtained with S395C, K399C, A401C, and A419C (Fig. 3). A387C, however, which was sensitive to MTSES but not MTSET, was not protected from MTSES by prior MTSET incubation. Mutant M389C was not tested because it was only slightly inhibited at a saturating concentration of MTSES (Fig. 1C), making it difficult to detect protection. Mutant L406C was not tested because it requires >20 mm MTSET to reach full inactivation, making protection studies requiring even higher concentrations of MTSES impractical. MTSEA Biotinylation of Insensitive Mutants—Sixteen EL4 cysteine mutants showed no effect of either MTSET or MTSES on transport activity. We tested the accessibility of these positions to MTSEA-biotin, which reacts with accessible cysteines to attach a biotin moiety. Reaction is detected directly by recovery of the biotinylated protein on streptavidin-conjugated beads, eliminating the need to see an effect on activity. In order for these results to be meaningful, however, we needed to know how well each mutant was expressed on the cell surface. Results from mutants with very low cell surface expression could lead us to believe that the cysteine in question was not accessible. All 16 insensitive mutants had transport activities similar to the parent construct C109A, suggesting adequate surface expression. However, to be certain, these mutants were tested for total cell surface expression using another membrane-impermeant biotinylating reagent, NHS-SS-biotin, which reacts with extracellular lysine residues. There are four extracellular lysines in SERT, all of which have previously been shown to react (6Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12675-12681Google Scholar). Recovery by NHS-SS biotinylation is thus a measure of total cell surface expression rather than accessibility. Fig. 4 shows representative biotinylation results for two controls, C109A and E493C, and two MTSET and MTSES insensitive mutants, D393C and Y410C. The protein band shown runs at a molecular mass of 90 kDa, which we have shown previously to represent the mature, fully glycosylated, cell surface form of SERT (19Visiers I. Weinstein H. Rudnick G. Stephan M.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6784-6793Google Scholar). Each mutant or control is represented by 2 lanes, labeled M, for MTSEA-biotin-labeled, and N, for NHS-SS-biotin-labeled.

In Fig. 4, the M and N lanes for E493C contain equivalent amounts of total protein, and it can be seen that NHS-SS-biotin and MTSEA-biotin pulled down similar amounts of transporter. This result was not entirely expected, since the two reagents do not necessarily react at the same rates, and since E493C contains four external lysine residues but only one external cysteine. As described more fully in Ref. 19Visiers I. Weinstein H. Rudnick G. Stephan M.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6784-6793Google Scholar, the reaction conditions for the two reagents were different. MTSEA-biotin was applied in one 10-min incubation, whereas NHS-SS-biotin was applied in two freshly prepared incubations of 20 min each. This difference, coupled with the fact that there are four targets for NHS-SS-biotin as opposed to one for MTSEA-biotin, was apparently enough to make up for any differences in reaction rates.

But how clustering is achieved and sustained is not known. Here we establish that an LFA-1-associated molecule, PTA-1, is localized to membrane rafts and binds the carboxyl-terminal domain of isoforms of the actin-binding protein 4.1G. Protein 4.1 is known to associate with the membrane-associated guanylate kinase homologue, human discs large. We show that the carboxyl-terminal peptide of PTA-1 also can bind human discs large and that the presence or absence of this peptide greatly influences binding between PTA-1 and different isoforms of 4.1G. T cell stimulation with phorbol ester or PTA-1 cross-linking induces PTA-1 and 4.1G to associate tightly with the cytoskeleton, and the PTA-1 from such activated cells now can bind to the amino-terminal region of 4.1G. We propose that these dynamic associations provide the structural basis for a regulated molecular adhesive complex that serves to cluster and transport LFA-1 and associated molecules.

A successful immunological response requires the activation, proliferation, and differentiation of T cell subsets into effector cells. These events are initiated by signals generated by sustained interaction between T cell receptors (TCR) 1The abbreviations used are: TCR, T cell receptor(s); APC, antigen-presenting cell; FERM, four point one ezrin radixin moesin; ERM, ezrin, radixin, moesin; MAGUK, membrane-associated guanylate kinase homologue; hDlg, human discs large; GEM, glycolipid-enriched membranes; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CTD, carboxyl-terminal domain; ATD, amino-terminal domain; ICAM, intercellular adhesion molecule; GAKIN, guanylate kinase-associated kinesin; mAb, monoclonal antibody; aa, amino acid(s); CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; RAM, rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin(s); MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PKC, protein kinase C; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. 1The abbreviations used are: TCR, T cell receptor(s); APC, antigen-presenting cell; FERM, four point one ezrin radixin moesin; ERM, ezrin, radixin, moesin; MAGUK, membrane-associated guanylate kinase homologue; hDlg, human discs large; GEM, glycolipid-enriched membranes; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CTD, carboxyl-terminal domain; ATD, amino-terminal domain; ICAM, intercellular adhesion molecule; GAKIN, guanylate kinase-associated kinesin; mAb, monoclonal antibody; aa, amino acid(s); CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; RAM, rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin(s); MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PKC, protein kinase C; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. and antigen-presenting cells (APC), together with the engagement of accessory counter receptors between the T cell and APC. Without the coordinated engagement of accessory receptors, engagement of the TCR can result in T cell anergy (1Boussiotis V.A. Freeman G.J. Berezovskaya A. Barber D.L. Nadler L.M. Science. 1997; 278: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Receptor engagement and signaling appear to be coordinated, both temporarily and spatially, at a specialized region known as the immunological synapse (2Grakoui A. Bromley S.K. Sumen C. Davis M.M.

Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Crucial to the formation of the immunological synapse are specialized membrane microdomains known as rafts (6Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref Scopus (5059) Google Scholar) and also the rearrangement of elements of the cytoskeleton. Both of these essential components are influenced by receptor engagement at the synapse, and, in turn, both orchestrate molecular distribution and signal transduction during the interaction (7Miceli M.C.

An initiating event in synapse formation may be the migration of intercellular adhesion molecule 3 (ICAM-3) to sites of cell-cell contact with the APC, where it engages its counter receptor as part of the “scanning” process (10Montoya M.C.

Engagement of ICAM-3 results in an increase in intracellular calcium concentration, the activation of tyrosine kinases, and activation of the integrin LFA-1 (10Montoya M.C. Sancho D. Bonello G.

Subsequently, the TCR and small accessory adhesion receptors migrate to the core of the synapse to form the central supramolecular activating complex, and larger molecules, including LFA-1 and associated talin, are displaced to an outer adhesive ring, the peripheral supramolecular activating complex (2Grakoui A.

Immunol. 2002; 14: 66-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). These movements may be regulated in part by the greater numbers of small molecules simply displacing LFA-1 and other larger molecules within rafts (30Krummel M.F. Davis M.M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 66-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). However, larger adhesion molecules such as CD43, the presence of which might hinder TCR engagement on physical grounds, are actively excluded from the synapse by association with ERM proteins (31Shaw A.S. Immunity. 2001; 15: 683-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The ERM proteins themselves participate in a number of processes essential to T cell activation, including the movement of adhesion receptors, membrane and cytoskeletal redistribution, and signal transduction (32Roumier A.

Members of an extended protein 4.1 superfamily, these proteins are characterized by their possession of a FERM domain toward the amino terminus and an F actin-binding segment at the carboxyl terminus: in the resting state, these regions form an intramolecular association that masks other associations, but following activation by threonine phosphorylation and binding of phosphoinositides, the tail region is able to extend to bind actin, and the FERM domain is exposed to bind the juxtamembrane region of any of several adhesion molecules, thereby providing a transmembrane linkage to the actin cytoskeleton (36Pearson M.A. Reczek D.

Takakuwa Y. Higashi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30322-30328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In addition, however, this domain of protein 4.1 can bind to another class of proteins, the membrane-associated guanylate kinase homologues (MAGUKs) (41Hoover K.B. Bryant P.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). MAGUK family members contain a number of protein-protein interactive domains, including Src homology 3 and PDZ domains, and serve to mediate the tight clustering of both transmembrane receptors and ion channels at sites of cell-cell communication such as neuronal synapses (42Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 432-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Since the sequence of amino acids in the FERM domain of 4.1 that binds to transmembrane receptors can differ from that bound by MAGUKs, these molecules potentially can form a protein 4.1-transmembrane protein-MAGUK ternary complex to provide a functional unit at the plasma membrane with links to the cytoskeleton, and there are now several examples of such a clustering complex (41Hoover K.B.

Chem. 2000; 275: 24540-24546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Furthermore, linkages between these complexes and the cytoskeleton may be more than passive, since several regulators of small GTPases contain residues conserved in the 4.1-MAGUK binding site (41Hoover K.B.

Recent work from Chishti's laboratory has raised the exciting possibility that such a MAGUK complex might play a role in the formation of physical contacts between T cells and APC and in the regulation of T cell activation, thus extending the commonalities between the immunological synapse and classical neuronal synapses (46Hanada T.

Moreover, in different cell types, both MAGUKs and members of the 4.1 family are able to bind transmembrane proteins, thus contributing to the scaffolding complex (41Hoover K.B. Bryant P.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In the present study, we identify a binding partner for the protein 4.1 paralogue, 4.1G, in T cells, the transmembrane protein PTA-1 (CD226). In addition, we demonstrate that PTA-1 can bind to hDlg in a process requiring its carboxyl-terminal peptide residues, which contain a PDZ-binding motif. We show that PTA-1 binds to the carboxyl-terminal domain of 4.1G, and the proteins associate under resting conditions, but, upon stimulation of Jurkat cells, PTA-1 now can bind to the amino-terminal region of 4.1G and the complex associates with the cytoskeleton. PTA-1 (also known as CD226, TLiSA-1, and DNAM-1) is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, the expression of which is regulated by phorbol ester and calcium (53Shibuya A. Campbell D. Hannum C.

In addition, cross-linking of LFA-1 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PTA-1, possibly mediated by Fyn with which PTA-1 also associates. Circumstantially, these findings place PTA-1 at the peripheral supramolecular activating complex of the immunological synapse during T cell activation and suggest that it may play a role in LFA-1 activation and downstream signaling. In this study, we additionally show that PTA-1 associates with Rap-1 in membrane fragments from activated T cells and that the complex of protein 4.1G, hDlg, and PTA-1 is contained within membrane rafts. Antibodies—The LeoA1 (55Burns G.F. Triglia T. Werkmeister J.A. Begley C.G. Boyd A.W. J. Exp. Med. 1985; 161: 1063-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and FMU4 (60Jia W. Liu X.S. Zhu Y.

Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to 4.1G were raised against GST fusion proteins containing the amino-terminal domain, 4.1G-Head (aa 1–115) and the carboxyl-terminal domain, 4.1G-Tail (aa 830–1005). Affinity-purified IgG was obtained using either GST-4.1G-Head or GST-4.1G-Tail conjugated to a 1:1 mixture of Affi-gel 10 and 15 (Bio-Rad) (1 mg of protein/10 ml of resin). Pooled antisera from multiple bleeds were loaded through the relevant column, and bound IgG was eluted with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.4, immediately reneutralized with one-fifth volume of 1 m Tris, pH 8.0, and dialyzed against Tris saline buffer, pH 7.4. This affinity-purified antibody was then passed through a GST-Affi gel 10/15 column to remove IgG against the GST portion of the fusion protein. The mAb directed against hDlg (2D11) was a gift from Dr. M. Lutchman (Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, MA). The VIIIA7 anti-DAF mAb was a gift from Dr. D. Shafren (Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Newcastle). The Rap1 and calnexin mAbs were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The anti-CD3 mAb (OKT3) was purchased from ATCC. Cell Lines and Establishment of Permanent Transfectants—The Jurkat T cell line (ATCC) was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Thermo Trace, Melbourne, Australia) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (CSL, Melbourne, Australia). PTA-1 cDNA was subcloned into the high expression level eukaryotic vector, pEF-BOS, as described previously (54Sherrington P.D. Scott J.L. Jin B. Simmons D. Dorahy D.J. Lloyd J. Brien J.H. Aebersold R.H. Adamson J. Zuzel M. Burns G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21735-21744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The permanent Jurkat-PTA-1 cell line was established using the LipofectAMINE™ 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) to introduce a 10:1 excess of the pEF-BOS-PTA-1 vector (which lacks a eukaryotic selection marker) to pREP9 (which encodes neomycin phosphotransferase; Invitrogen), followed by selection with 750 μg/ml G-418 (Invitrogen). The PTA-1-positive population was verified by flow cytometry and further enriched by fluorescence-activated cell sorting with the LeoA1 mAb. The Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line permanently transfected with PTA-1 (CHO-PTA-1) or DAF (CHO-DAF) were established as described above and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (CSL, Melbourne, Australia) with 10% fetal bovine serum. The CHO-DAF cells were kindly provided by Dr. D. Shafren. Isolation of Glycolipid-enriched Membranes (GEMs)—These were prepared as described previously (61Thorne R.F. Marshall J.F. Shafren D.R. Gibson P.G. Hart I.R. Burns G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35264-35275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Briefly, Jurkat-PTA-1 cells (∼7 × 107 cells/treatment) were treated with TPA (Sigma) at 50 ng/ml at 37 °C for varying times, as indicated, or cross-linked with either LeoA1 or control mAbs followed by rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulins (RAM) (as described below). Whole cell lysates were solubilized in 1% Triton X-100 in MES-buffered saline, pH 6.5, adjusted to 40% sucrose and applied under a discontinuous 5–30% sucrose gradient. Following overnight ultracentrifugation, the GEMs separated as a low density light-refractive band. The soluble fraction and GEMs were collected; GEMs were washed and dissolved in MES-buffered saline; and the insoluble pellet was further processed by washing with MES-buffered saline and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and then reducing Laemmli sample buffer was added to the pellet and boiled. Equal protein quantities (15 μg) of the GEM and soluble fractions, along with an equal proportion of the insoluble pellets, were separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose (Sartorius, Germany) using 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol transfer buffer. To visually determine equal protein loading, the nitrocellulose membrane was stained with Ponceau S (0.5% Ponceau S, 1% glacial acetic acid) and then washed with TTBS, followed by immunoblot analysis. Immunoblotting—Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked in 5% skim milk in TTBS (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 144 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) before incubation with primary antibody in 1% skim milk/TTBS. Membranes were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit immunoglobulins (Bio-Rad), and the immunocomplexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. Between subsequent probes, membranes were stripped by incubation at 60 °C for 30–45 min with 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, containing 100 mm 2-β-mercaptoethanol and 2% SDS. Cross-linking of PTA-1 Antigen—Jurkat-PTA-1 cells (5 × 107 cells/treatment) or CHO-PTA-1 cells (1 × 107 cells/treatment) were harvested by centrifugation or with trypsin-versene solution, respectively, washed with culture medium, and then resuspended in 1 ml of medium containing 10 μg of LeoA1 or control mAb for 15 min at room temperature. After washing, the cells were either cross-linked with 10 μg of RAM in 1 ml of medium or incubated in medium alone for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were washed with cold PBS before lysis and processing for SDS-PAGE analysis. Immunoisolation of Plasma Membrane Fragments—The method described by Harder and Kuhn (62Harder T. Kuhn M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) was used with slight modifications. Briefly, LeoA1 (anti-PTA-1) and OKT3 (anti-CD3) mAbs were coupled to M-450 sheep anti-mouse magnetic beads (Dynal), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Jurkat-PTA-1 cells (3 × 107 cells/treatment) were incubated with either the PTA-1- or CD3-coupled beads for 0, 5, and 10 min at 37 °C and then immediately pelleted at 4 °C. The bead-cell conjugates were washed in H buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 250 mm sucrose, 2 mm MgCl2,10 mm NaF and 1 mm vanadate supplemented with Complete™ protease inhibitors) and then resuspended in 1 ml of H buffer containing 0.2 mm pervanadate prior to homogenization of the cells on ice with a glass Dounce homogenizer. The homogenates were washed with cold H buffer, and the beads were isolated with a magnet (Dynal), and this was repeated three times. After the final wash, the proteins were eluted from the beads with reducing Laemmli sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting. Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—All MATCHMAKER yeast two-hybrid vectors and cDNA libraries were purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA), with the exception of the GAL4 DNA binding domain vector, pGBT9LacZ (a gift of Dr. I. Macreadie, Biomolecular Research Institute, Parkville, Australia). pGBT9LacZ contains a Trp-selectable marker and a GAL4-responsive lacZ gene (i.e. additional to that contained in the yeast chromosome), which allows for highly sensitive detection of interacting proteins by increasing the production of β-galactosidase. The cytoplasmic tail and part of the transmembrane region of PTA-1 (aa 266–336) was amplified by PCR from human PTA-1 cDNA using the forward 5′-gttgtttgaattctcaattacc-3′ and r"
https://openalex.org/W2024652333,"Histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG) is an α2-glycoprotein found in mammalian plasma at high concentrations (∼150 μg/ml) and is distinguished by its high content of histidine and proline. Structurally, HRG is a modular protein consisting of an N-terminal cystatin-like domain (N1N2), a central histidine-rich region (HRR) flanked by proline-rich sequences, and a C-terminal domain. HRG binds to cell surfaces and numerous ligands such as plasminogen, fibrinogen, thrombospondin, C1q, heparin, and IgG, suggesting that it may act as an adaptor protein either by targeting ligands to cell surfaces or by cross-linking soluble ligands. Despite the suggested functional importance of HRG, the cell-binding characteristics of the molecule are poorly defined. In this study, HRG was shown to bind to most cell lines in a Zn2+-dependent manner, but failed to interact with the Chinese hamster ovary cell line pgsA-745, which lacks cell-surface glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Subsequent treatment of GAG-positive Chinese hamster ovary cells with mammalian heparanase or bacterial heparinase III, but not chondroitinase ABC, abolished HRG binding. Furthermore, blocking studies with various GAG species indicated that only heparin was a potent inhibitor of HRG binding. These data suggest that heparan sulfate is the predominate cell-surface ligand for HRG and that mammalian heparanase is a potential regulator of HRG binding. Using recombinant forms of full-length HRG and the N-terminal N1N2 domain, it was shown that the N1N2 domain bound specifically to immobilized heparin and cell-surface heparan sulfate. In contrast, synthetic peptides corresponding to the Zn2+-binding HRR of HRG did not interact with cells. Furthermore, the binding of full-length HRG, but not the N1N2 domain, was greatly potentiated by physiological concentrations of Zn2+. Based on these data, we propose that the N1N2 domain binds to cell-surface heparan sulfate and that the interaction of Zn2+ with the HRR can indirectly enhance cell-surface binding.

Histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG) 1The abbreviations used are: HRG, histidine-rich glycoprotein; HRR, histidine-rich region; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; mAb, monoclonal antibody; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary.1The abbreviations used are: HRG, histidine-rich glycoprotein; HRR, histidine-rich region; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; mAb, monoclonal antibody; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary. is an ∼75-kDa single polypeptide chain α2-plasma glycoprotein synthesized in the liver and found in the plasma of most vertebrates at a relatively high concentration of 100–200 μg/ml (∼2 μm). The most distinctive feature of HRG arises from its high content of histidine and proline residues, which each account for ∼13% of the total amino acids (1Koide T. Foster D. Yoshitake S. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2220-2225Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). HRG is predicted to be a multidomain protein consisting of two cystatin-like domains at the N terminus (termed N1 and N2), a central histidine-rich region (HRR) flanked by two proline-rich sequences, and a C-terminal domain. HRG is known to bind a variety of ligands, including heme and Zn2+ (2Guthans S.L. Morgan W.T. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 218: 320-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 3Morgan W.T.

Chem. 1989; 264: 8249-8253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, HRG may potentially regulate numerous biological processes such as hemostasis, fibrinolysis, thrombosis, angiogenesis, leukocyte migration, and cancer metastasis.Despite considerable interest in HRG, many of the fundamental characteristics regarding HRG cell-surface binding remain undefined. For example, despite the identification of numerous soluble ligands for HRG, the cell-surface ligands are not well characterized. Indirect evidence suggests that negatively charged glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) may mediate HRG cell-surface binding, as heparin is a potent inhibitor of HRG binding to cells (16Borza D.B. Morgan W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5493-5499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 17Brown K.J. Parish C.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13918-13927Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Zn2+ is also known to interact with HRG, most probably with the proposed metal chelation sites located within the HRR (2Guthans S.L. Morgan W.T. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 218: 320-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 3Morgan W.T. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1054-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 4Morgan W.T. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1496-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), with this interaction enhancing the binding of HRG to cells (18Olsen H.M. Parish C.R. Altin J.G. Immunology. 1996; 88: 198-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Similarly, the location of the cell surface-binding domain within HRG is unclear. The ability of Zn2+ to enhance cell-surface binding and the assumption that heparin binds to the HRR and inhibits binding have led to the hypothesis that the HRR interacts with cells surfaces (10Peterson C.B. Morgan W.T. Blackburn M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7567-7574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Burch M.K. Blackburn M.N. Morgan W.T.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1925-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In contrast, it has also been suggested that a heparin-binding sequence may be located in the N1N2 domain, which raises the possibility that this domain of HRG may interact with cells (17Brown K.J. Parish C.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13918-13927Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 20Koide T. Odani S. Ono T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1985; 98: 1191-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 21Koide T. Odani S. Ono T. FEBS Lett. 1982; 141: 222-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).In this study, we have characterized the cell surface-binding properties of HRG using recombinant full-length HRG and the recombinant N1N2 domain together with various approaches to remove GAGs from cell surfaces. We provide clear evidence that heparan sulfate is the dominant cell-surface ligand for HRG, with the interaction being mediated though the N1N2 domain of HRG. Indeed, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) studies confirmed that the N1N2 domain specifically binds to immobilized heparin with comparable affinity to full-length HRG. Furthermore, cell-surface binding of full-length HRG, but not the N1N2 domain, was greatly potentiated by the presence of physiological concentrations of Zn2+. Based on these data, we propose a model whereby HRG binds to cell-surface heparan sulfate via its N1N2 domain with low affinity, which is enhanced following Zn2+ binding to the HRR. Thus, HRG may play an important physiological and/or pathological role by binding to cell surfaces in local environments that contain high levels of Zn2+ such as sites of inflammation or during tumor metastasis and angiogenesis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines—B16F1, COS-7, MT4, HT1080, and Jurkat cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. CHO-K1 and pgsA-745 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 21 μg/ml l-proline and 10% fetal calf serum. Mammalian cell lines were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The Spodoptera frugiperda-derived insect cell line Sf9 was cultured in Sf-900 II serum-free medium (Invitrogen) at 27 °C.Purification of HRG—Native human HRG was purified from fresh human plasma as described previously (22Rylatt D.B. Sia D.Y. Mundy J.P. Parish C.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 119: 641-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, a phosphocellulose column was equilibrated with loading buffer (0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, and 1 mm EDTA (pH 6.8)) for 24 h. Fresh human plasma was provided by Red Cross House of Canberra Hospital (Canberra, Australia) and mixed with NaCl and EDTA to final concentrations similar to those of the loading buffer and with the protease inhibitors aprotinin (2 μg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (100 μg/ml), and 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (100 μg/ml). The plasma was passed through the equilibrated column; unbound protein was removed by extensive washing with loading buffer; and bound HRG was eluted with 2.0 m NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, and 1 mm EDTA (pH 6.8).Synthesis of L1–L5 Peptides—The HRR within human HRG is composed of 12 tandem repeats, with the dominant consensus repeat sequence being the 5-amino acid motif GHHPH. Synthetic peptides composed of one to five repeats of this 5-amino acid motif (termed L1–L5, respectively) were produced. L1–L3 peptides biotinylated at the N terminus were also prepared. The L1–L5 peptides were provided as a kind gift by Dr. Joe Altin (School of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Australian National University).Plasmid Constructs—Using the pUC9-HRG plasmid construct as a template (1Koide T. Foster D. Yoshitake S. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2220-2225Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), PCR with oligonucleotides ALJ-1 and ALJ-5 was carried out to amplify a cDNA encoding full-length human HRG comprising the leader, first cystatin (N1) domain, second cystatin (N2) domain, HRR, and C-terminal domain coding regions. The N1N2 coding region cDNA was generated by amplification with oligonucleotides ALJ-1 and ALJ-3. N1N2 was engineered to contain a hexahistidine tag at the 3′-end of the molecule through inclusion of six tandem histidine codons in oligonucleotide ALJ-3. The oligonucleotide primer sequences used are as follows: ALJ-1, 5′-TTGAATTCTAAAGGGATGGTTTAACAAAATG-3′; ALJ-3, 5′-AAGGTACCTTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGCTGAGGGTCGAAGACTTCAC-3′; and ALJ-5, 5′-AAGGTACCTTATTTTGGAAATGTATGTGTAAAAAAC-3′. The amplified HRG and N1N2 cDNAs were cloned into the EcoRI/KpnI sites in the donor vector construct pFastBac (Invitrogen), generating the pFastBac-HRG and pFastBac-N1N2 constructs, respectively. The nucleotide integrity of each clone was confirmed by automated sequencing using an Applied Biosystems 3730 DNA analyzer.Transfections and Recombinant Protein Production Using the Baculovirus Expression System—Recombinant proteins of full-length human HRG and the N2N2 domain of human HRG were produced using the “Bac-to-Bac” baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen). Recombinant bacmid constructs were generated using the pFastBac-HRG or pFast-Bac-N1N2 construct according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, Sf9 cells were transfected using Cellfectin reagent (Invitrogen), with 1–2 μg of recombinant bacmid DNA being transfected per 9 × 105 cells for 5 h at 27 °C. Supernatant containing recombinant baculovirus was harvested 72 h post-transfection and was amplified for 3–4 days at 27 °C by infecting Sf9 cells with a multiplicity of infection of ∼0.01–0.1. Typically, recombinant baculovirus was amplified three times before being used to produce recombinant protein. Harvested Sf9 supernatant containing recombinant protein was purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA)-agarose (QIAGEN Inc., Hilden, Germany). Recombinant full-length HRG and hexahistidine-tagged N1N2 were eluted from Ni-NTA-agarose with 200 mm cold imidazole.Western Blotting—Recombinant proteins were boiled for 10 min in 20 μl of SDS reducing sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 20% glycerol, 10% dithiothreitol, and 4% SDS) and then subjected to electrophoresis on a 4–20% (w/v) gradient precast polyacrylamide minigel (Gradipore, Sydney, Australia). Proteins were transferred electrophoretically using a Mini-Protean II apparatus (Bio-Rad) onto a nitrocellulose membrane using a transfer buffer containing 48 mm Tris and 39 mm glycine in 20% (v/v) methanol. The membrane was blocked overnight with 5% (w/v) skim milk powder diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Full-length HRG and the N1N2 domain were detected using the HRG-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) HRG-4 (AGEN, Brisbane, Australia) and by chemiluminescence using ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom).Immunofluorescence Flow Cytometry—Cell lines were analyzed for HRG binding or cell-surface heparan sulfate expression by immunofluorescence flow cytometry. Typically, plasma-purified or recombinant HRG or the recombinant N1N2 domain (100 μg/ml) was added to 5 × 105 cells in PBS and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) with or without 20 μm Zn2+ for 60 min at 4 °C and washed three times with PBS and 0.1% BSA. Cell-bound HRG or N1N2 was detected using the HRG-specific mAb HRG-4, and cell-surface heparan sulfate was detected by mAb F58-10E4 (Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan), followed by secondary detection with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled sheep anti-mouse Ig (Amrad Biotech, Melbourne, Australia). Cells were analyzed by immunofluorescence flow cytometry using an LSR flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), with forward scatter, side scatter, and Fl-1 data being collected. Flow cytometry data were analyzed using CellQuest Pro software (BD Biosciences). Each treatment condition was typically repeated in triplicate, and each experiment was repeated two to three times unless stated otherwise. In some experiments, cells were treated with mammalian heparanase (2 units/ml), bacterial heparinase III (2 units/ml; Sigma), or chondroitinase ABC (2 units/ml; Sigma) diluted in PBS and 0.1% BSA for 2 h at 37 °C. In other experiments, human HRG (100 μg/ml) was co-incubated with different GAGs (0.5–100 μg/ml), including bovine lung heparin (3.1, 4.5, 10.6, 12.5, and 16.7 kDa) and chondroitin sulfates A, B, C, and E (Sigma). Also, in some cases, cells were incubated with the biotinylated L1–L3 peptides (100 μm), with peptide binding to the cells being detected by R-phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin (Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, CA).ELISAs—ELISAs were performed by coating 96-well polyvinyl chloride microtiter plastic plates (Dynex Technologies Inc., Chantilly, VA) overnight at 4 °C with recombinant full-length HRG or N1N2 (50 μl/well, ∼5 μg/ml) in 0.05 m Na2CO3/NaHCO3 buffer (pH 9.6) (Sigma) or with streptavidin (50 μl/well, 10 μg/ml; Sigma) diluted in PBS. Plates were then washed with PBS and 0.02% Tween 20 and blocked for 120 min at room temperature with 3% (w/v) BSA diluted in PBS. In some experiments, biotinylated heparin (10 μg/ml) diluted in PBS and 1% BSA was added to the streptavidin-coated plates for 60 min at room temperature before addition of HRG or the N1N2 domain (50 μl/well, ∼0.1–100 nm) diluted in PBS in the absence or presence of 20 μm Zn2+ and/or 1 mm EDTA. Bound HRG and N1N2 were detected using the HRG-specific mAb HRG-4, followed by secondary antibody detection with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse Ig (Amrad Biotech). Plate-bound peroxidase was detected using 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) peroxidase substrate (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) and measuring the absorbance at 405 nm (reference wavelength of 490 nm) on a Thermomax microplate reader. Data were analyzed using SoftMax Pro software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).RESULTSHRG Binding to Cell Surfaces Is Zn2+-dependent—Previous studies have suggested that the binding of HRG to cell surfaces is highly Zn2+-dependent, with physiological concentrations of Zn2+ (∼20 μm) being particularly efficacious (18Olsen H.M. Parish C.R. Altin J.G. Immunology. 1996; 88: 198-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Initial experiments used immunofluorescence flow cytometry to analyze the effects of 20 μm Zn2+ on the binding of plasma-derived HRG to six different mammalian cell lines with widely differing tissue and species origins, viz. mouse melanoma cells (B16F1), human T-cells (MT4 and Jurkat), monkey kidney fibroblasts (COS-7), human fibrosarcoma cells (HT1080), and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (Fig. 1A). HRG bound to five of the six lines tested in a highly Zn2+-dependent manner, with the exception of human umbilical vein endothelial cells, which exhibited negligible HRG binding in both the presence and absence of Zn2+.Human HRG Interacts with Cell-surface Heparan Sulfate—It has been postulated previously that cell-surface GAGs such as heparan sulfate are able to interact with HRG (16Borza D.B. Morgan W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5493-5499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 17Brown K.J. Parish C.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13918-13927Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis directly, advantage was taken of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines that either express cell-surface GAGs (CHO-K1) or lack cell-surface GAGs (pgsA-745) due to a deficiency in xylosyltransferase (23Esko J.D. Stewart T.E. Taylor W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3197-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 24Esko J.D. Elgavish A. Prasthofer T. Taylor W.H. Weinke J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15725-15733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that GAG-expressing (GAG+ve) CHO cells bound HRG in a Zn2+-dependent manner, but that GAG-deficient (GAG–ve) CHO cells did not bind HRG in either the presence or absence of 20 μm Zn2+ (Fig. 1, B and C). These results indicate that HRG binds to cell-surface GAGs and that this interaction is enhanced by physiological concentrations of Zn2+ (20 μm). Previous studies have reported that HRG interacts with the GAG heparin (10Peterson C.B. Morgan W.T. Blackburn M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7567-7574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Lijnen H.R. Hoylaerts M. Collen D. J. Biol.

Thus, ELISA studies were carried out to analyze the effect of Zn2+ on the binding of full-length HRG to plastic immobilized heparin. Consistent with previous results (16Borza D.B. Morgan W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5493-5499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), HRG interacted with immobilized heparin, and this interaction was enhanced ∼4-fold in the presence of 20 μm Zn2+ (Fig. 1D). Cell-surface GAGs are composed of a mixture of heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfates A and C, dermatan sulfate (chondroitin sulfate B), and hyaluronic acid (25Capila I. Linhardt R.J. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2002; 41: 390-412Crossref Scopus (1523) Google Scholar). To define the specific cell-surface GAGs that interact with HRG, we enzymatically removed heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfates A, B, and C from GAG+ve CHO cells. Initially, using a heparan sulfate-specific mAb and immunofluorescence flow cytometry, we verified that GAG+ve CHO cells express high levels of cell-surface heparan sulfate and that GAG–ve CHO cells do not express heparan sulfate (Fig. 2A). The enzymatic activity of mammalian heparanase, bacterial heparinase III, and chondroitinase ABC was verified by demonstrating by fast protein liquid chromatography that the enzymes could cleave heparan sulfate or chondroitin 6-sulfate chains, respectively, into smaller fragments (data not shown). GAG+ve CHO cells that were treated with either mammalian heparanase or bacterial heparinase III were completely depleted of surface heparan sulfate (Fig. 2, B and C). Subsequently, HRG binding to these mammalian heparanase- and heparinase III-treated cells was found to be markedly reduced (∼85–90%) (Fig. 2, D and E). In contrast, chondroitinase ABC treatment had no effect on HRG binding (Fig. 2, D and E). These results indicate that HRG binds specifically to cell-surface heparan sulfate and not chondroitin sulfates and that heparan sulfate is the principal cell-surface receptor for HRG on cells. Results from additional binding inhibition experiments carried out with a range of soluble GAGs were consistent with heparan sulfate being the GAG receptor for HRG on cells. Thus, various sized fragments of bovine lung heparin (4.5–16.7-kDa preparations) were potent inhibitors of the interaction of HRG with GAG+ve CHO cells, although very low molecular mass heparin (3.5 kDa) was a relatively ineffectual inhibitor (Table I). In contrast, chondroitin sulfates A, B, C, and E were totally inactive as inhibitors (Table I).Fig. 2Human HRG interacts with cell-surface heparan sulfate and not chondroitin sulfate.

To test this hypothesis, peptides corresponding to the histidine repeat sequence within the HRR of HRG were synthesized and used in binding studies. The peptides comprised one (L1), two (L2), three (L3), four (L4), or five (L5) repeats of the dominant pentapeptide motif GHHPH that is tandemly repeated in the HRR of human HRG. Immunofluorescence flow cytometry analysis indicated that biotinylated preparations of the L1–L3 peptides did not bind to GAG+ve CHO cells in either the presence or absence of 20 μm Zn2+ (Fig. 3A), with R-phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin being used to monitor peptide binding. Furthermore, HRG blocking experiments revealed that high concentrations (100 μm) of the L1–L5 peptides failed to inhibit full-length HRG binding to GAG-expressing CHO cells and B16F1 melanoma cells (Fig. 3B). These data contrast with previous indirect evidence that the HRR binds heparan sulfate (12Burch M.K. Blackburn M.N. Morgan W.T.

A, GAG+ve CHO cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 20 μm Zn2+ with biotinylated peptides that correspond to one (L1), two (L2), or three (L3) repeats of the consensus histidine pentapeptide of the HRR of HRG (GHHPH) (100 μm), with peptide binding being detected using R-phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin by immunofluorescence flow cytometry. Results are shown as -fold increase in peptide binding above background, with a value of 1 representing background binding (shown as a dashed line). Binding of HRG (100 μg/ml) as detected by the HRG-specific mAb HRG-4 is presented as a control. B, GAG+ve CHO cells and B16F1 melanoma cells were incubated with HRG (100 μg/ml) and 20 μm Zn2+ in the presence or absence of peptides corresponding to one to five repeats of the consensus histidine pentapeptide (L1–L5; 100 μm) and then analyzed for HRG binding using the HRG-specific mAb HRG-4 by immunofluorescence flow cytometry.

https://openalex.org/W1996985045,"Human Ero1α is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident protein responsible for protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) oxidation. To clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying its function, we generated a panel of cysteine replacement mutants and analyzed their capability of: 1) complementing a temperature-sensitive yeast Ero1 mutant, 2) favoring oxidative folding in mammalian cells, 3) forming mixed disulfides with PDI and ERp44, and 4) adopting characteristic redox-dependent conformations. Our results reveal that two essential cysteine triads (Cys85-Cys94-Cys99 and Cys391-Cys394-Cys397) cooperate in electron transfer, with Cys94 likely forming mixed disulfides with PDI. Dominant negative phenotypes arise when critical residues within the triads are mutated (Cys394, Cys397, and to a lesser extent Cys99). Replacing the first cysteine in either triad (Cys85 or Cys391) generates mutants with weaker activity. In addition, mutating either Cys85 or Cys391, but not Cys397, reverts the dominant negative phenotype of the C394A mutant. These findings suggest that interactions between the two triads, dependent on Cys85 and Cys391, are important for Ero1α function, possibly stabilizing a platform for efficient PDI oxidation.

A fundamental requirement for secretory and membrane proteins to be efficiently manufactured in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; DTT, dithiothreitol; PDI, protein disulfide isomerase; JcM, Myc-tagged version of J chain. is the formation of their correct disulfide bonds. This process relies on a network of protein-protein interactions that precisely regulates the redox equilibrium in the organelle (1Fassio A. Sitia R. Histochem.

Efficient oxidation of substrate proteins is catalyzed by ER resident oxidoreductases such as protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) (4Oliver J.D. Roderick H.L. Llewellyn D.H. High S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2573-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). These proteins transfer oxidative equivalents to their substrates via the formation of mixed disulfide intermediates.

Cell. 1999; 4: 469-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Reoxidation of yeast Ero1p seems to involve electron transfer to molecular oxygen via flavin adenine dinucleotide (14Tu B.P. Ho-Schleyer S.C. Travers K.J. Weissman J.S.

Considering their role in oxidative folding, Ero1 proteins are expected to have active sites characterized by the presence of conserved cysteine residues. Two cysteine pairs are essential for the function of yeast Ero1p. Cysteines 100/105 seem important for thiol-disulfide exchange with Pdi1p and Mpd2p, whereas cysteines 352/355 are probably in charge of oxidizing the former pair (16Frand A.R. Kaiser C.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2833-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The yeast 352/355 pair is part of a conserved CXXCXXC motif, essential for function (7Pollard M.G. Travers K.J. Weissman J.S.

Mutations of these two residues inhibit the oxidation of a reporter protein, confirming that Ero1α is a pivotal component in mammalian oxidative protein folding (12Mezghrani A. Fassio A. Benham A. Simmen T. Braakman I. Sitia R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6288-6296Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The sequence of human Ero1α contains 15 cysteines, many of which are conserved among species and members of the Ero1 family (Fig. 1) and likely play distinct roles. Catalytic cysteines could bind PDI and other upstream or downstream components in the electron transport chain. Structural cysteines may be responsible for the characteristic compaction of Ero1α (17Benham A.M. Cabibbo A. Fassio A. Bulleid N. Sitia R. Braakman I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4493-4502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another potential function includes homo- or heterodimerization, which has been postulated by complementation assays in yeast (18Pagani M. Pilati S. Bertoli G. Valsasina B. Sitia R. FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Here we analyzed the functional properties of a wide panel of Ero1α deletion or cysteine replacement mutants. We present evidence showing that human Ero1α contains two essential cysteine triads, suggesting that interactions involving the first cysteines of each triad increase the efficiency of electron transport, possibly stabilizing a platform for efficient PDI oxidation. Chemicals and Antibodies—Chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless noted otherwise. Polyclonal anti-PDI antibody was a kind gift from A. Benham (Durham, UK) and I. Braakman (Utrecht, Netherlands).

The final PCR products were cloned using the pGEM-T-easy cloning kit (Promega, Milan, Italy) and sequenced. The cDNAs were excised with Acc65I and XbaI and inserted in-frame into pcDNA3.1myc/his(–)A (Invitrogen) or into pvT102U (18Pagani M. Pilati S. Bertoli G. Valsasina B. Sitia R.

Each mutant is identified by the position number of the mutated residue and the amino acid used to replace it (e.g. C394A). Cell Culture and Transfection—HeLa cells were transfected using Lipofectin (Invitrogen) as recommended by the supplier. All constructs were verified for expression using immunofluorescence as described previously (9Pagani M. Fabbri M. Benedetti C. Fassio A. Pilati S. Bulleid N.J. Cabibbo A. Sitia R. J. Biol.

JcM Folding Assays—The radioactive version of this assay was performed by pulse chase and immunoprecipitation as described (12Mezghrani A. Fassio A. Benham A. Simmen T. Braakman I. Sitia R.

For nonradioactive folding assays, transfected cells were trypsinized and incubated for 5 min at 37 °C with 5 mm DTT in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without fetal calf serum. After two washes in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C, cells were cultured at 37 °C without DTT for different times and quenched with 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide before lysis in radioimmune precipitation buffer supplemented with 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide and protease inhibitors. Aliquots from the post-nuclear supernatants were resolved under nonreducing conditions. Western blots were decorated with 9E10 anti-Myc (12Mezghrani A. Fassio A. Benham A. Simmen T. Braakman I. Sitia R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6288-6296Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) followed by enzyme-conjugated secondary antibodies. Each mutant was tested at least twice. The nature of these folding assays implies a certain degree of interassay variability (compare, for example, Figs. 3 and 7). For reasons that are not entirely clear (cell density, passage number), the JcM folding rate varies also in cells not transfected with Ero1 genes. Extremely reproducible, in contrast, are the promoting effects of wild-type Ero1α on oxidative folding (in dozens of experiments; see Figs. 3 and 7) and the behavior of each mutant within a given experiment in reference to wild-type and mock-transfected cells. Raw data concerning the many experiments performed are available upon request.Fig. 7Cooperativity between clusters 2 and 3.

Two clones for each mutant were selected and grown in liquid culture; one clone for each transformant was plated on SD–Leu and incubated at 37 °C (spot assay). For the liquid growth assay, cells growing logarithmically at 24 °C were resuspended at 0.1 A600/ml in rich YEPD medium (yeast extract/peptone/dextrose; Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI) and incubated at 37 °C. Growth was monitored by measuring absorbance every 2 h at A600 Analysis of Folding Patterns (Ox1-Ox2)—Two days after transfection with the different Ero1α mutants, cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer plus 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide.

A limitation of this approach is that some mutants could undergo folding defects. To exclude this possibility, we exploited the notion that when over-expressed in HeLa cells, some Ero1α is secreted (13Anelli T. Alessio M. Bachi A. Bergamelli L. Bertoli G. Camerini S. Mezghrani A. Ruffato E. Simmen T.R., S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5015-5022Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Some mutants, particularly those in the C-terminal region (e.g. Δ404–420) formed high molecular weight aggregates and were not secreted at all, indicating that they did not pass the ER quality control barriers. A list and partial characterization of the folding mutants, which are not described in this study, can be made available upon request. All of the mutants analyzed herein are detergent-soluble, secreted, and form at least one of the two characteristic Ox1 and Ox2 redox isoforms (Table I), thus excluding gross folding alterations.Table IFunctional properties of Ero1α mutantsMutationFolding assayero1-1 complementationPDI bindingOx1Ox2IPWBSpotLiquidwt Ero1αActiveActive++++++DeletionΔ33-50NDActive+ND+++Δ86-95NDDom. neg.-ND++-Cluster 1C35SNDActive+NDND++C46S, C48SNDActive+ND+++Cluster 2C85SWeakly activeND+++aA pattern that is qualitatively different from wild-type (wt) Ero1α.-aA pattern that is qualitatively different from wild-type (wt) Ero1α.+aA pattern that is qualitatively different from wild-type (wt) Ero1α.C94SWeakly activeND++±+-C99AWeak Dom. neg.Weak Dom. neg.± (dots)±+++C104SActiveND++++++Scattered cysteinesC131AActiveND+ND++-C166AActiveND+++±++C206SActiveND+ND±++C241SActiveND+ND±++Cluster 3C391AWeakly activeWeakly active+++aA pattern that is qualitatively different from wild-type (wt) Ero1α.-aA pattern that is qualitatively different from wild-type (wt) Ero1α.+aA pattern that is qualitatively different from wild-type (wt) Ero1α.C394ADom. neg.Dom. neg.--+++C397ADom. neg.Dom. neg.--++-Glycosylation sitesN280ANDActive+ND+++N384ANDActive+ND+++N280A,N384ANDActive+ND+++a A pattern that is qualitatively different from wild-type (wt) Ero1α. Open table in a new tab To monitor oxidative protein folding in vivo, we used a previously described pulse-chase assay (12Mezghrani A. Fassio A. Benham A. Simmen T. Braakman I. Sitia R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6288-6296Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) or a simplified version based on Western blotting. Unlike in the previously described assay (12Mezghrani A. Fassio A. Benham A. Simmen T. Braakman I. Sitia R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6288-6296Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), not all intracellular J chains were reduced in the Western blot assays (Fig. 2), suggesting that some pre-existing molecules are trapped in partially DTT-resistant complexes (12Mezghrani A. Fassio A. Benham A. Simmen T. Braakman I. Sitia R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6288-6296Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 21Molinari M. Galli C. Piccaluga V. Pieren M. Paganetti P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). 2G. Bertoli, T. Simmen, T. Anelli, S. Nerini Molteni, R. Fesce, and R. Sitia, unpublished results. Nonetheless, the activity of Ero1α mutants can be monitored readily by comparing the shift from reduced to oxidized J chain (Fig. 2). Using the Western blot protocol, we first examined mutants of cysteine clusters 1 and 2. The deletion mutant Δ33–50, lacking all cysteines of cluster 1, was as active as wild-type Ero1α (Fig. 2). Also single and double cysteine mutants in cluster 1 retained their activity (Table I) confirming that this nonconserved cluster is not essential for function. In contrast, mutant Δ86–95 displayed a weak but reproducible dominant negative activity and also failed to complement the defective yeast mutant ero1-1 (Fig. 2 and Table I), revealing a functional role for cluster 2. After this preliminary survey, we refined our tools and analyzed individual amino acid replacements by immunoprecipitation folding assays. Among individual cysteine-replacement mutants, C85S and C94S were less active than wild-type Ero1α, whereas C99A acted as a weak dominant negative (Fig. 3). Mutation of C104 did not impair the ability to promote JcM folding, further confirming the specificity of the phenotypes observed. Within cluster 3, as described previously (12Mezghrani A. Fassio A. Benham A. Simmen T. Braakman I. Sitia R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6288-6296Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 18Pagani M. Pilati S. Bertoli G. Valsasina B. Sitia R. FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), C394A and C397A did not complement ero1-1 and behaved as strong dominant negative phenotypes, whereas mutant C391A displayed reduced activity similar to C85S (Table I). Mutants in the four “scattered” cysteines (C131A, C166A, C208S, and C241S) were almost as active as wild-type molecules, and so were mutants lacking either one or both glycosylation sites (Table I). In agreement with the functional data obtained in mammalian cells, transformation of ero1-1 with the C104S, C131A, C166A, C208S, and C241S mutants allowed vigorous growth at the nonpermissive temperature (Fig. 4; Table I). In contrast, C85S and C94S showed a normal pattern in the spot assay (Fig. 4A) but were clearly deficient in the more sensitive growth curve test (Fig. 4B). The growth of the C99A mutant was severely compromised and was barely detectable in the spot test, where it showed a characteristic speckled pattern (Fig. 4A). As expected, mutants C394A and C397A were not able to complement ero1-1 at all. These results confirm a fundamental role for cysteine clusters 2 and 3 in Ero1α activity, as described in yeast Ero1p (16Frand A.R. Kaiser C.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2833-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the Cys85 and Cys391 mutants displayed a similarly reduced capability of supporting yeast growth. Differential Binding to PDI and ERp44 —Next we compared the mutants for their ability to bind PDI and ERp44, two proteins known to form mixed disulfides with Ero1α (11Anelli T. Alessio M. Mezghrani A. Simmen T. Talamo F. Bachi A. Sitia R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 835-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 17Benham A.M. Cabibbo A. Fassio A. Bulleid N. Sitia R. Braakman I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4493-4502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Four mutants bound considerably less PDI: C94S, C166A, C208S, and C241S (Fig. 5A). Unlike C94S, however, the latter three mutants retained functional activity in both mammalian and yeast cells. This suggests that Ero1α-PDI mixed disulfides can be formed for reasons other than transferring oxidative equivalents to PDI. The four mutants that bound less PDI interacted as well as the wild-type with ERp44, indicating the differing modes of interaction of these two proteins with Ero1α. An analysis of nonreducing blots revealed additional interesting features (Fig. 5B). The dominant negative mutants C99A, C394A, and C397A bound PDI in more or less normal amounts, the latter exhibiting an additional band of unknown origin (Fig. 5B). The two mutants in the first cysteines of each essential cluster (Cys85 and Cys391) displayed similarities also with respect to PDI binding, accumulating additional high molecular weight bands and fewer 120-kDa heterodimers. Structural Features of Cysteine Mutants as Revealed by Ox1-Ox2 Formation—The similarities between Cys85 and Cys391 extended to their electrophoretic patterns in nonreducing gels. In addition to forming characteristic mixed disulfides with PDI (12Mezghrani A. Fassio A. Benham A. Simmen T. Braakman I. Sitia R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6288-6296Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and ERp44 (11Anelli T. Alessio M. Mezghrani A. Simmen T. Talamo F. Bachi A. Sitia R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 835-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), and perhaps some homodimers, monomeric Ero1α molecules separate into two redox-sensitive isoforms, Ox1 and Ox2 (17Benham A.M. Cabibbo A. Fassio A. Bulleid N. Sitia R. Braakman I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4493-4502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ratios between the two isoforms can be modified by oxidizing or reducing treatments (11Anelli T. Alessio M. Mezghrani A. Simmen T. Talamo F. Bachi A. Sitia R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 835-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), but their functional significance is still not clear. Both C85S and C391A (see Fig. 6) accumulated partially reduced molecules as well as an additional form migrating between the normal Ox1 and Ox2, rarely seen in wild-type molecules. Pulse-chase experiments (Ref. 17Benham A.M. Cabibbo A. Fassio A. Bulleid N. Sitia R. Braakman I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4493-4502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and footnote 2) suggest that the C85S and C391A mutants share the incapacity to develop a stable Ox1 form. The intermediate band that we detected could likely reflect the formation of what normally generates Ox2 without the previous stabilization of Ox1. Other mutants, namely C94S, C397A, and C131A (Table I), showed the absence of Ox2. These three mutants are part of different functional groups; C94S is weakly active and shows a weaker binding to PDI, C131A has no distinctive phenotype, and C397A behaves as a dominant negative. As the formation of Ox2 does not directly correlate with functional phenotypes, we did not investigate its significance further. Double and Triple Cysteine Mutants Reveal Cooperativity between Clusters 2 and 3—To further clarify the functional role of cysteines 85 and 391, we generated double cysteine replacement mutants (Fig. 7). The double mutant C394A, C397A retained strong dominant negative activity. In contrast, when either Cys391 or Cys85 was replaced concomitantly with Cys394, the dominant negative phenotype was lost. Substitution of Cys85 or Cys391 reverted the dominant negative phenotype of Cys99 as well (not shown). Therefore, the absence of the first cysteine of each triad makes Ero1α less active, both in promoting and in inhibiting disulfide bond formation. Taken together, these findings indicate that Cys85 and Cys391 are necessary to coordinate the activity of clusters 2 and 3 in the functional cycle of human Ero1α. The process of Ero1α-dependent PDI oxidation likely involves several steps: docking of reduced PDI, formation of PDI-Ero1α mixed disulfides, detachment of oxidized PDI, and recharging of Ero1α. By correlating the phenotypes of mutants with predicted functional defects we could assign potential functions to single cysteines. The mutants analyzed were not grossly impaired in their folding, since they formed Ox1 and/or Ox2 and passed the ER quality control to be secreted by HeLa transfectants. The first conclusion is that, in addition to the conserved cysteine triad located in the C-terminal end of the molecule (cysteines 391, 394, and 397), another cysteine cluster (in the form of the triad Cys85-Cys94-Cys99) is essential for Ero1α function. Deletion and replacement mutants within these triads are severely impaired in the ability to promote disulfide bond formation and to complement Ero1p-defective yeast mutants. Three dominant negative mutants based on single cysteine substitutions were identified, all mapping within these two triads; these were C99A, C394A, and C397A, the phenotype of the first being less pronounced than that of the latter two. The existence of two active sites has been proposed also in yeast Ero1p (12Mezghrani A. Fassio A. Benham A. Simmen T. Braakman I. Sitia R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6288-6296Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The sequence similarities within the crucial regions and the observation that human molecules can complement defective yeast imply that the basic mechanisms of electron transfer are conserved among distant eukaryotes. Besides confirming this notion, our findings reveal that the first two cysteines within each triad, namely Cys85 and Cys391, play an important role in the process. Intriguingly, the phenotypes of the two mutants C85S and C391A are similar in several respects. First, both mutants display structural defects, as indicated by the different behaviors of the monomeric proteins under nonreducing conditions and by the paucity of the disulfide-linked complexes with PDI. From a functional point of view, both mutants are less active in promoting JcM oxidation and in complementing ero1-1 yeast cells. Our interpretation of these findings is that interactions between Cys85 and Cys391 bring together the two active sites, thus facilitating electron transfer from PDI to upstream acceptors. The most obvious way to accomplish this would be the formation of a reversible disulfide bond between the two residues. This bond might lead to the formation of Ox1, absent in both mutants. However, attempts to detect the corresponding disulfide-linked peptides by mass spectrometry failed. Several technical reasons explain these negative findings, including interchange reactions within gel-extracted molecules, reduction of the bond possibly favored by the ionization energy, or differential detectability of certain molecular species. In perfect agreement with our proposal of disulfide linkages between the two Ero1α triads, analysis of yeast Ero1p crystals revealed the presence of an intra-molecular disulfide between C90 and C349 (24Gross E. Kastner D.B. Kaiser C.A. Fass D. Cell. 2004; 117: 601-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) corresponding to C85 and C391 in human Ero1α. Ero1α can fold into Ox1- and Ox2-like isoforms also, when translated in vitro and hence in the absence of PDI and ERp44. In contrast, Ero1α-PDI and Ero1-ERp44 mixed disulfides are seen only when ER membranes are added (12Mezghrani A. Fassio A. Benham A. Simmen T. Braakman I. Sitia R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6288-6296Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 17Benham A.M. Cabibbo A. Fassio A. Bulleid N. Sitia R. Braakman I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4493-4502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).2 If indeed Ox1 is caused by an intramolecular bond linking Cys85 and Cys391, then the presence of PDI and ERp44 is not essential for its formation. The capability of forming disulfide bonds in a reducing environment, as found in DTT-treated cells (12Mezghrani A. Fassio A. Benham A. Simmen T. Braakman I. Sitia R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6288-6296Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), 3A. Mezghrani, A. Orsi, and R. Sitia, unpublished results. is in line with the pivotal role of Ero1α in promoting disulfide bond formation (12Mezghrani A. Fassio A. Benham A. Simmen T. Braakman I. Sitia R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6288-6296Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Further evidence for a common functional role of Cys85 and Cys391 stems from the analysis of double mutants. Clearly, replacing either residue in the Cys99 or Cys394 mutants abolished the dominant negative phenotype. Therefore, the promoting function of the 85–391 couple is evident not only in productive reactions but also in the limiting of disulfide bond formation. With the screening methods used, no function could be assigned to the N-terminal cysteine-rich cluster. Whether the two CXC motifs found in cluster 1 have any functional significance as isomerases, as proposed by Woycechowsky and Raines (22Woycechowsky K.J. Raines R.T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5387-5394Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), remains to be tested. Also the two glycosylation sites are apparently dispensable for Ero1α function, since mutating either one or both did not affect activity in either JcM folding or yeast complementation assays. Mutants lacking Cys94, Cys166, Cys208, or Cys241 bound less PDI at steady state. Similarly, Frand and Kaiser (16Frand A.R. Kaiser C.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2833-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) report defective PDI binding for the Cys100 and Cys208 yeast Ero1p mutants. However, only in the case of C94S (and its counterpart in yeast Ero1p, Cys100) was functional activity compromised, suggesting that this residue, located in essential cluster 2, is responsible for forming intermediate mixed disulfides with PDI in electron transfer reactions. These results also imply that mixed disulfides between Ero1 and PDI can be formed for reasons other than transferring oxidative equivalents to PDI. Perhaps PDI can bind excess or mutated Ero1α in its capacity of quality controller (23Tsai B. Rodighiero C. Lencer W.I. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 2001; 104: 937-948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). ERp44 bound similarly well to all Ero1α cysteine replacement mutants, including the four showing reduced interactions with PDI. We have recently proposed that the interaction with ERp44 is important in retaining Ero1α intracellularly (13Anelli T. Alessio M. Bachi A. Bergamelli L. Bertoli G. Camerini S. Mezghrani A. Ruffato E. Simmen T.R., S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5015-5022Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Mass spectrometry analyses of overexpressed Ero1α revealed that Cys166, Cys208, and Cys241 are mainly in thiol form, 4S. Camerini, G. Bertoli, T. Anelli, R. Sitia, and A. Bachi, unpublished results. which could make Ero1α a multivalent substrate for ERp44. In conclusion, clusters 2 and 3 are part of distinct domains that might come in close contact for efficient electron transfer from PDI to Ero1α and to the upstream acceptors. Although not essential for function, the stabilizing role of Cys85 and Cys391 clearly enhances the activity of the ER oxidizing machine, likely by aligning cysteines 94, 99, 394, and 397.

Previously, we have demonstrated that, among the three RRMs of La protein, the RRM2 interacts with HCV internal ribosome entry site (IRES) around the GCAC motif near the initiator AUG present in the stem region of stem-loop IV (SL IV) (Pudi, R., Abhiman, S., Srinivasan, N., and Das S. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 12231–12240). Here, we have demonstrated that the mutations in the GCAC motif, which altered the binding to RRM2, had drastic effect on HCV IRES-mediated translation, both in vitro and in vivo. The results indicated that the primary sequence of the stem region of SL IV plays an important role in mediating internal initiation. Furthermore, we have shown that the mutations also altered the ability to bind to ribosomal protein S5 (p25), through which 40 S ribosomal subunit is known to contact the HCV IRES RNA. Interestingly, binding of La protein to SL IV region induced significant changes in the circular dichroism spectra of the HCV RNA indicating conformational alterations that might assist correct positioning of the initiation complex. Finally, the ribosome assembly analysis using sucrose gradient centrifugation implied that the mutations within SL IV of HCV IRES impair the formation of functional ribosomal complexes. These observations strongly support the hypothesis that La protein binding near the initiator AUG facilitates the interactions with ribosomal protein S5 and 48 S ribosomal assembly and influences the formation of functional initiation complex on the HCV IRES RNA to mediate efficient internal initiation of translation.

HCV 5′-UTR is highly conserved and folds into a complex secondary structure comprising four major structural domains (I–IV) and a pseudoknot in the vicinity of the initiator AUG codon (6Brown E.A. Zhang H. Ping L. Lemon S.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5041-5045Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 7Rijnbrand R.C.A. Lemon S.M. Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany2000: 85-111Google Scholar). The cis-elements promote assembly of initiation complex independent of the 5′-end and thus mediate internal initiation of translation in a cap-independent manner (7Rijnbrand R.C.A. Lemon S.M. Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany2000: 85-111Google Scholar). Domain I is not a part of IRES and most likely is involved in RNA replication, whereas domains II and III are complex and consist of multiple stem-loops and bulge-loops. Even minor mutations in domains II and III substantially reduce IRES activity, but this could in most cases be regained by compensatory second site mutations that restored secondary structure. Highly conserved residues are often unpaired and may thus be able to interact with the components of the translation apparatus. Domain IV consists of a stem-loop that contains initiator AUG codon and has been shown to play a key role in regulating the initiation of translation of the HCV RNA (5Kamoshita N. Tsukiyama-Kohara K. Kohara M. Nomoto A. Virology. 1997; 233: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 8Honda M. Ping L.H. Rijnbrand R.C.A. Amphlett E. Clarke B. Rowlands D. Lemon S.M.

It appears from earlier reports that both the sequence and stability of the domain IV stem might control efficiency of HCV IRES translation (11Honda M. Brown E.A. Lemon S.M. RNA (N. Y.). 1996; 2: 955-968PubMed Google Scholar, 12McKnight K.L. Sandefur S. Phipps K.M. Heinz B. Virology. 2003; 317: 345-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). These observations have led to a model for IRES function in which the structural elements in the IRES act as a scaffold that orients the potential binding sites in such a way that their interactions with initiation factors and ribosomes lead to assembly of functional ribosomal initiation complexes (13Hellen C.U.T. Sarnow P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1593-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). HCV IRES binds to the 40 S ribosomal subunit specifically and stably even in the absence of any initiation factors. Addition of eIF2/GTP/Met-tRNAi is sufficient for 40 S subunit to lock onto initiator AUG (13Hellen C.U.T. Sarnow P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1593-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). eIF3, though not essential for the formation of 48 S complex formation, it has been shown to bind to the apical half of domain III and is likely to be a constituent of the 48 S-IRES complex in vivo (14Pestova T.V. Shatsky I.N. Fletcher S.P. Jackson R.J. Hellen C.U. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 67-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 15Sizova D.V. Kolupaeva V.G. Pestova T.V. Shatsky I.N. Hellen C.U.T. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4775-4782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 48 S complex formation on HCV IRES has no requirement for eIF4A, 4B, 4E, 4G, or for ATP hydrolysis (14Pestova T.V. Shatsky I.N. Fletcher S.P. Jackson R.J. Hellen C.U. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 67-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 15Sizova D.V. Kolupaeva V.G. Pestova T.V. Shatsky I.N. Hellen C.U.T. J.

Because the viral 5′-UTR forms a binary complex with the 40 S ribosomal subunit in the absence of any canonical or non-canonical initiation factors, it is likely that the additional factors may stimulate internal initiation of translation following the assembly of RNA-40 S complex. Recently, binding of a 25-kDa cellular protein (p25) to HCV IRES has been shown to be important for the efficient translation initiation. p25 was originally suggested to be ribosomal protein S9 but later identified as rpS5 (14Pestova T.V. Shatsky I.N. Fletcher S.P. Jackson R.J. Hellen C.U. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 67-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 17Fukushi S. Kurihara C. Ishiyama N. Hoshino F.B. Oya A. Katayama K. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1662-1666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Fukushi S. Okada M. Stahl J. Kageyama T. Hoshino F.B. Katayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20824-20826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In fact, HCV IRES has been suggested to have a prokaryotic-like mode of interaction with the 40 S ribosomal subunit, where the 40 S ribosomal subunit is thought to interact with the HCV-IRES through p25 (14Pestova T.V. Shatsky I.N. Fletcher S.P. Jackson R.J. Hellen C.U. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 67-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). However, eukaryotic mRNAs and picornaviral IRESs have not been reported to require S5 protein for the ribosome assembly. Recently we have shown that a small RNA corresponding to the stem-loop III e+f domain of the HCV IRES, when introduced in trans, can antagonize cellular protein binding to the viral IRES and inhibits HCV IRES-mediated translation. The RNA molecule showed strong interaction with the ribosomal S5 protein and prevented the recruitment of the 40 S ribosomal subunit by the HCV IRES (19Ray P.S. Das S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1678-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Therefore, it appears that any event that might facilitate S5 interaction with HCV IRES could be crucial for efficient ribosome assembly at the initiation site. It is believed that HCV IRES contains one set of determinants that is required for initial ribosome recruitment and a second set that promotes accurate placement of the initiation codon in the ribosomal P site (13Hellen C.U.T. Sarnow P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1593-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Several cellular trans-acting factors that are known to bind to HCV IRES and influence the internal initiation might play a role in the formation of functional initiation complex after the initial binding of 40 S ribosomes to the IRES. Most notable among these are the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB), (20Ali N. Siddiqui A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6367-6375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) the La autoantigen (21Ali N. Siddiqui A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2249-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), and poly(rC) binding protein 2 (PCBP 2) (22Fukushi S. Okada M. Kageyama T. Hoshino F.B. Nagai K. Katayama K. Virus Res. 2001; 73: 67-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) etc. In case of picornaviruses, a model has been proposed in which the IRES trans-acting factors such as PTB help the RNA to attain or maintain an active conformation in which it is able to bind essential factors and the 43 S ribosome complex in a productive manner (23Kaminski A. Jackson R.J. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 626-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In hepatitis A virus, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was found to destabilize the folded structures of the RNA stem-loops and influence the IRES activity (24Schultz D.E. Hardin C.C. Lemon S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14134-14142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Human La autoantigen was found to enhance the accuracy of initiation codon selection in poliovirus IRES (25Meerovitch K. Svitkin Y.V. Lee H.S. Lejbkowicz F. Kenan D.J. Chan E.K. Agol V.I. Keene J.D. Sonenberg N. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3798-3807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The human La protein is an RNA-binding protein, belonging to the RNA recognition motif (RRM) superfamily (26Gottlieb E. Steitz J.A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 841-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 27Gottlieb E. Steitz J.A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 851-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). La protein is ubiquitously expressed in many eukaryotic organisms, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Xenopus laevis, and Drosophila melanogaster (28Yoo C.J. Wolin S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5412-5424Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). La protein has been shown to interact with a wide variety of cellular and viral RNAs and has been implicated in various cellular processes, which include RNA polymerase III transcription termination (27Gottlieb E. Steitz J.A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 851-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), telomere homeostasis (29Ford L.P. Sway J.W. Wright W.E. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 1068-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), internal initiation of translation of Bip mRNA, poliovirus, coxsackievirus B3, encephalomyocarditis virus, and hepatitis C virus (30Ray P.S. Das S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4500-4508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Wolin S.L. Cedervall T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 375-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Also, La protein has been shown to be capable of unwinding DNA-RNA hybrids and double-stranded RNA in an ATP-dependent manner (32Huhn P. Pruijn G.J. van Venrooij W.J. Bachmann M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 410-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). La protein specifically interacts with both the 5′- and 3′-UTR of HCV RNA (33Spangberg K. Wiklund L. Schwartz S. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). La protein plays a functional role in internal initiation of translation where addition of purified La to RRL in the in vitro translation assays using HCV IRES resulted in stimulation of translation activity (21Ali N. Siddiqui A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2249-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Inhibition of HCV IRES activity caused by sequestration of La protein can be rescued by exogenous addition of purified La protein (34Das S. Ott M. Yamane A. Tsai W. Gromier M. Lahser F. Gupta S. Dasgupta A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5638-5647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Izumi R.E. Das S. Barat B. Raychaudhuri S. Dasgupta A. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 3763-3776Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Previously, La protein has been shown to bind to HCV IRES in the context of initiator AUG (21Ali N. Siddiqui A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2249-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Recently, we showed that, of the three RRMs present in La, RRM2 binds HCV RNA around the region encompassing the GCAC motif located in the stem region near the initiator AUG (36Pudi R. Abhiman S. Srinivasan N. Das S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12231-12240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanism with which the La protein influences the stimulation of HCV IRES activity is yet to be elucidated. Here we report for the first time a possible functional role of La protein interaction near the initiator AUG of the HCV-IRES RNA to mediate efficient internal initiation of translation. We have demonstrated that mutations in the GCAC motif near initiator AUG within the SL IV, which alter the primary sequence while retaining the overall secondary structure affect the binding of La-RRM2 to HCV IRES. Also, these mutations have drastic effect on the HCV IRES-mediated translation both in vitro and in vivo, indicating that the sequence GCAC might play an important role in maintaining the IRES function. Further, we have observed that the mutations also alter the binding of certain cellular proteins to HCV IRES, especially p25 (S5), whose binding may have been influenced by the binding of La protein to HCV IRES in the SL IV region. Interestingly, addition of increasing concentration of La protein helped in the binding of S5 protein suggesting that La protein might play a role in recruitment of the 40 S ribosomal subunit to the HCV IRES RNA. Additionally, the circular dichroism spectra of HCV stem-loop IV RNA showed a dose-dependent increase in the presence of increasing concentrations of La protein indicating that HCV IRES may undergo some conformational alterations upon binding to La protein, which assist in the formation of functional initiation complex. Finally, sucrose gradient centrifugation analysis of ribosome assembly implied that the mutations within HCV IRES lead to reduced efficiency in the formation of functional ribosomal complex. Taken together, the results strongly suggest that La protein interaction near the initiator AUG might be involved in conformational alteration to facilitate better contact with the 40 S ribosomal subunit required for efficient internal initiation of translation. Plasmids—HCV 1b-encoding plasmid, pCV, was generously gifted by Dr. Akio Nomoto and Dr. Tsukiyama-Kohara, University of Tokyo, Japan. HCV 5′-UTR along with 42-nt coding sequence (18–383 nt) was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) to generate pcDHCV-383 as described earlier (36Pudi R. Abhiman S. Srinivasan N. Das S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12231-12240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). pcD-SL IV containing nt 293–383 of HCV IRES was obtained by amplifying HCV SL IV using the primers, 5′-ATAGAAGCTTGCCTGATAGGTCTGCGA-3′ and 5′-CGCGAATTCGTTACGTTTGGTTTT-3′, from the template plasmid pc-DHCV-383 and cloned between HindIII and EcoRI sites of the pcDNA3. The PCRs were carried out with 30 cycles, each cycle consisting of denaturation (95 °C for 40 s), annealing (55 °C for 1 min), and extension (68 °C for 1 min/1 kb) using Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The cDNA clone encoding human La autoantigen, pET-La was obtained from Dr. Jack Keene, Duke University. La coding sequence and La 101–208 (RRM2) were subcloned into pRSET-A vector (Invitrogen) (36Pudi R. Abhiman S. Srinivasan N. Das S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12231-12240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Ribosomal protein S5 containing plasmid pQE-RS5 was obtained from Dr. Shuetsu Fukushi, Biomedical Laboratories, Japan. S5 coding sequence was obtained from the vector by digesting with HindIII and BamHI and subcloned into pRSET-A vector. All the mutants described in the study were generated by using a megapriming PCR method as described previously (37Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar). The method utilizes three oligonucleotide primers to perform two rounds of PCR. The product of the first PCR is used as one of the primers (a “megaprimer”) for the second polymerase chain reaction. The first round of PCR was carried out using the 3′ primer corresponding to 383 nt of HCV RNA, 5′-CGCGAATTCGTTACGTTTGGTTTT-3′, and the following 5′ primers carrying the specific mutations, 5′-CCGTGCATCAAGAGCACAAAT-3′, 5′-TCGTAGACCACTAATCATGATAGTAAATCCTAA-3′, and 5′-TCGTAGACCCGGTATCATGAACCGAAATCCTAA-3′. The PCRs were carried out for 35 cycles, each cycle consisting of denaturation (95 °C for 40 s), annealing (55 °C for 1 min), and extension (72 °C for 10 s) using TaqDNA polymerase (Bangalore Genie) or Pfx polymerase. The amplification products were subjected to 9% native PAGE and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. The bands were cut and incubated in 400 μl of elution buffer (0.5 m ammonium acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1% SDS) overnight at 37 °C. The supernatant was subjected to phenol-chloroform extraction, and the DNAs were alcohol-precipitated. The megaprimers thus obtained were then used as 3′ primers in the second round of PCR along with the HCV 5′ primer, 5′-TATAAGCTTGGATCCCCGGCGACA-3′. The PCRs were carried out for 35 cycles, each cycle consisting of denaturation (95 °C for 40 s), annealing (60 °C for 1 min), and extension (72 °C for 30 s) using TaqDNA polymerase or Pfx polymerase. The PCR products were digested with HindIII and EcoRI and cloned into pcDNA3 vector. pcD-SL IV M4mut was generated using the primers 5′-ATAGAAGCTTGCCTGATAGGGTGCTTGCGA-3′, 5′-CGCGAATTCGTTACGTTTGGTTTT-3′, using the plasmid M4 as template and cloned between HindIII and EcoRI sites of the pcDNA3. For the construction of bicistronic constructs, the two reporter genes, Renilla luciferase (RLuc) and Firefly luciferase (FLuc) coding sequences were PCR-amplified using Pfx polymerase using the following primers, 5′-GCATGCTAGCACCATGACTTCGAAA-3′, 5′-GGCCAAGCTTACCATGATTCGAAA-3′, 5-GCATCTCGAGGAAGACGCCAAAAAC-3′, and 5′-ATTAGGGCCCTTACACGGCGATCTT-3′. The 5′ primer of FLuc lacks the initiator AUG codon, because the HCV IRES has an initiator AUG located within. The amplified RLuc was cloned into NheI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1 (+) vector (Invitrogen), and FLuc was cloned into XhoI and ApaI sites. The wild-type and mutant HCV IRES were cloned into HindIII and EcoRI sites between the two reporter genes. Preparation of HeLa S10 Cell Extract—HeLa cells used for preparing cell extract were grown in T75 flasks in minimal essential medium (pH 7.0) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Monolayer of HeLa cells were harvested, pelleted down, and washed thrice with cold isotonic buffer (35 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 146 mm NaCl, 11 mm glucose), resuspended in 1.5× packed cell volume of hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 15 mm KCl, 1.5 mm magnesium acetate, and 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and then incubated on ice for 10 min. Cells were then transferred to a Down's homogenizer and disrupted by 50 strokes on ice (lysis was checked under microscope). The lysate was incubated in 1× incubation buffer for 10 min. Cytoplasmic extract (S10 supernatant) was isolated by centrifuging the lysate at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was dialyzed for 4 h against 100 volumes of dialysis buffer and aliquoted into pre-chilled tubes. The aliquots of S10 extract were stored at –70 °C. Purification of rpS5, La Full-length, and RRM2 Proteins Using a Nickel-Nitrilotriacetic Acid-Agarose Column—Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with pRSET-A vectors containing either the full-length or the deletion mutant of La or the full-length rpS5. Transformed colonies were inoculated into 100 ml of LB broth containing 75 μg/ml ampicillin and grown at 37 °C in an incubator shaker at 200 rpm speed until the OD660 reached 0.6. The cultures were induced with 0.6 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and grown for further 4 h. The cells were pelleted and resuspended in 5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole). The extract was made by sonication. The above crude extracts were mixed with 500 μl of nickelnitrilotriacetic acid-agarose slurry (Qiagen) and kept for rocking at 4 °C for 4 h. The lysate was loaded onto a column, and the flow-through was discarded. The column was washed with 50 ml of wash buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 40 mm imidazole). The bound protein was eluted with 500 μl of elution buffer containing 500 mm imidazole. The eluted proteins were dialyzed at 4 °C for 4–6 h in 500 ml of dialysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 100 mm KCl, 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol), aliquoted, and stored in –70 °C freezer. In Vitro Transcription—mRNAs were transcribed in vitro from different linearized plasmid constructs under T7 promoters in run-off transcription reactions. The HCV bicistronic constructs were linearized with PmeI downstream of firefly luciferase and used as templates for RNA synthesis. The linear DNA were electrophoresed on agarose gels and extracted by using Qiagen gel elution kit and capped bicistronic RNA were synthesized using Ribomax Large scale RNA production system-T7 (Promega) under standard conditions with addition of 5′ cap analog (Promega). Radiolabeled mRNAs were transcribed in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase (Promega) and [32P]uridine triphosphate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The pcDNA3 vectors containing wild-type or mutant HCV IRES were linearized with EcoRI, gel-eluted, and transcribed in vitro to generate the 32P-labeled RNA. The transcription reaction was carried out under standard conditions (Promega protocol) using 2.5 μg of linear template DNA at 37 °C for 1.5 h. After alcohol precipitation, the RNA was resuspended in 25 μl of nuclease-free water. 1 μl of the radiolabeled RNA sample was spotted onto DE81 filter paper, washed with phosphate buffer, and dried, and the incorporated radioactivity was measured using liquid scintillation counter. Filter Binding Assay—The 32P-labeled wild-type or mutant HCV IRES RNAs were incubated with the La RRM2 or RRM3 proteins at 30 °C for 15 min in RNA binding buffer (containing 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 25 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 3.8% glycerol, 2 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm EDTA) and loaded onto nitrocellulose filters equilibrated with the 2-ml RNA binding buffer. The filters were then washed four times with 1 ml of binding buffer and air-dried. The counts retained were measured in liquid scintillation counter. The graph was plotted with protein concentration (micromolar) on the x-axis, and the percentage of bound RNA was plotted as the percentage of counts retained, on the y-axis. UV Cross-linking Experiment—The 32P-labeled wild-type or mutant HCV IRES RNAs were incubated with the purified proteins or HeLa S10 extract at 30 °C for 15 min in RNA binding buffer (containing 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 25 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 3.8% glycerol, 2 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm EDTA) and then irradiated with a hand-held UV lamp for 10 min. The mixture was treated with 30 μg of RNase A (Sigma) at 37 °C for 30 min. The protein-nucleotidyl complexes were electrophoresed on SDS-10% PAGE analyzed by phosphorimaging analysis. In the experiments performed in the presence of La protein, the RNA was incubated with the purified proteins at 30 °C for 10 min prior to binding with HeLa S10 extracts. In Vitro Translation—In vitro translation of the capped bicistronic mRNAs were carried out in micrococcal nuclease treated rabbit reticulocyte lysates (RRL, Promega Corp.). Briefly, 12.5-μl reaction mixtures contained 8.75 μl of RRL containing 0.25 μl each of minus methionine mixture, 5 μCi of [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 10 units of RNasin (Promega) were incubated at 30 °C for 1.5 h. 1 μlofthe reaction mixtures was assayed for both the Renilla and firefly luciferase activity according to Promega protocol using Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system. 7 μl of the reaction mixtures was electrophoresed on SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel, dried, and analyzed by phosphorimaging. Transfection of HeLa/Huh7 Monolayer Cells—HeLa/Huh7 cells grown in 30-mm dishes at 60–70% confluence were transfected with 2 μg of the bicistronic constructs using Tfx 20 transfection reagent (Promega) according to manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the DNA was mixed with 5 μl of Tfx 20 reagent and diluted to 1 ml using the MEM (Invitrogen) and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The cells were washed with medium and overlaid with 1 ml of MEM containing the above DNAs. After 1 h of incubation at 37 °C, 0.8 ml of MEM, and 0.2 ml of fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) was added to the dishes. After 36 h, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed using 1× passive lysis buffer (Promega) and assayed for RLuc and FLuc according to Promega protocol using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system. CD Spectroscopy—Measurements of CD spectra were performed with a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter as described earlier (38Hardin C.C. Corregan M.J. Brown II, B.A. Frederick L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5870-5880Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Spectra were obtained in 0.5 ml of RNA binding buffer (5 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 25 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 3.8% glycerol, 2 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA). CD spectra were obtained in the 240- to 320-nm range at 20 °C with HCV stem-loop IV WT or stem-loop IV M4 RNA (250 or 300 nm) and increasing concentration of purified recombinant La protein (0.5–2 μm). The molar ellipticity values were normalized for the contribution of the La protein at each concentration. Sucrose Gradient Centrifugation Analysis of Ribosomal Assembly on HCV IRES—The 32P-radiolabeled RNAs (∼2 × 105 cpm) were added to 50 μl of ribosome assembly reactions containing 35 μl of RRL, 0.5 μl each of minus methionine and minus leucine amino acid mixtures and 10 units of RNasin (Promega) and incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. The reactions were diluted to 150 μl with gradient buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT) and overlaid on a 5–30% (w/v) linear sucrose gradient. The ribosomal complexes were sedimented by ultracentrifugation for 3 h at 4 °C and 30,000 rpm using a Beckman SW41 swing bucket rot"

In bacteria, regulation of pantothenate kinase activity is a major factor in controlling intracellular coenzyme A levels, and pantothenate analogs are growth-inhibiting antimetabolites. We have extended the structural information on Escherichia coli pantothenate kinase by determining the structure of the enzyme·ADP· pantothenate ternary complex. Pantothenate binding induces a significant conformational change in amino acids 243–263, which form a “lid” that folds over the open pantothenate binding groove. The positioning of the substrates suggests the reaction proceeds by a concerted mechanism that involves a dissociative transition state, although the negative charge neutralization of the γ-phosphate by Arg-243, Lys-101, and Mg2+ coupled with hydrogen bonding of the C1 of pantothenate to Asp-127 suggests different interpretations of the phosphoryl transfer mechanism of pantothenate kinase. N-alkylpantothenamides are substrates for pantothenate kinase. Modeling these antimetabolites into the pantothenate active site predicts that they bind in the same orientation as pantothenate with their alkyl chains interacting with the hydrophobic dome over the pantothenate pocket, which is also accessed by the β-mercaptoethylamine moiety of the allosteric regulator, coenzyme A.

Chem. 1994; 269: 27051-27058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PanK activity is inhibited by non-esterified CoA and to a lesser extent by its thioesters, which competitively interfere with ATP binding (10Song W.J. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27051-27058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Vallari D.S. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2468-2471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the crystal structure of PanK was determined in complex with either ATP or CoA (12Yun M. Park C.G. Kim J.Y. Rock C.O. Jackowski S. Park H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28093-28099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These structures revealed that ATP and CoA bound to the enzyme in distinctly different ways; however, their phosphate binding sites overlapped at Lys-101, explaining the kinetic competition between the CoA regulator and the ATP substrate. There is no structural information on the nature of the pantothenate binding site on the enzyme and its relationship to the cavities occupied by ATP and the CoA allosteric regulator. All of the steps in CoA biosynthesis are encoded by widely expressed, essential genes, making them attractive targets for antibacterial drug discovery (13Gerdes S.Y. Scholle M.D. D'Souza M. Bernal A. Baev M.V. Farrell M. Kurnasov O.V. Daugherty M.D. Mseeh F. Polanuyer B.M. Campbell J.W. Anantha S. Shatalin K.Y. Chowdhury S.A. Fonstein M.Y. Osterman A.L. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4555-4572Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). E. coli PanK belongs to a family of bacterial enzymes that is distinct from the eukaryotic counterparts that carry out the same reaction (14Calder R.B. Williams R.S. Ramaswamy G. Rock C.O.

Gene. 2002; 291: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Although these data suggest that targeting PanK may be a viable strategy to attack a subset of bacterial species, one potential drawback to this approach is that such inhibitors may not be broad spectrum, because there are different, uncharacterized PanK isoforms in important pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17Osterman A. Overbeek R. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2003; 7: 238-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Several CoA analogs are inhibitors of key CoA-utilizing enzymes in vitro (18Mishra P.K. Drueckhammer D.G. Chem. Rev. 2000; 100: 3283-3310Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and one successful antibacterial strategy is the design of CoA anti-metabolites based on pantothenate (19Clifton G. Bryant S.R. Skinner C.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1970; 137: 523-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 20Strauss E. Begley T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48205-48209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). These compounds are phosphorylated by PanK and converted by CoaD and CoaE to ethyldethia-CoA, which is thought to interfere with cell growth by blocking a group of enzymes that utilize CoA and its thioesters (20Strauss E. Begley T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48205-48209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). HoPan is another pantothenate antagonist that has been used to treat mental disorders in humans (21Matsumoto M. Kuhara T. Inoue Y. Shinka T. Matsumoto I. J. Chromatogr. 1991; 562: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 22Noda S. Haratake J. Sasaki A. Ishii N. Umezaki H. Horie A.

Brain Dev. 1991; 13: 52-55Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), but its effectiveness as an antibacterial agent has not been evaluated. N5-Pan and N7-Pan are much larger molecules than pantothenate (Fig. 1), and understanding the structural basis for the ability of these bulky molecules to function as PanK substrates is important for the design of other analogs. The goal of this study was to characterize the structure of the pantothenate binding site on PanK to determine its relationship to the leading substrate, ATP, the allosteric regulator, CoA, and the antimetabolites. Our data provide new insights into the catalytic mechanism, CoA feedback regulation, and design of pantothenate antimetabolites. Protein Preparation—For crystallization experiments, the coaA gene encoding E. coli PanK (5Song W.J. Jackowski S. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6411-6417Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) minus the first eight amino acids (residues 9–316) was subcloned into pET21a and transformed into the E. coli BL21 (DE3) strain. The cells were grown at 37 °C in Luria Bertani broth supplemented with 100 μ g/ml ampicillin to an absorbance of 0.6 at 600 nm and then induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. The harvested cell pellets from 2 liters of bacterial culture were resuspended in 150 ml of disruption buffer (30 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 30 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and lysed with a French Pressure cell. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 60 min. After filtration, the crude lysate was applied to DEAE resin and eluted with a linear gradient of increasing salt concentration. Fractions containing PanK were pooled, concentrated, equilibrated to 1 m ammonium sulfate, and applied to phenyl-Sepharose 6B resin (Amersham Biosciences). PanK was eluted with a linear gradient of decreasing salt concentration. Fractions containing PanK were pooled, concentrated, and applied to Sephadex-75 gel filtration chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). The purified protein was concentrated to 30 mg/ml, dialyzed into storage buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA), flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. For kinetic experiments, E. coli PanK was overexpressed from a pET-15b plasmid with an N-terminal His tag and purified with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose and gel filtration chromatography as described previously (12Yun M. Park C.G. Kim J.Y. Rock C.O. Jackowski S. Park H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28093-28099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214351) Google Scholar) using γ-globulin as a standard. Crystallization—Co-crystals of PanK, ADP, and pantothenate were grown by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Prior to crystallization, PanK was incubated overnight with 30 mm ADP, 30 mm pantothenate, and 30 mm magnesium nitrate. Hanging drops containing equal volumes of the protein and reservoir solutions were equilibrated at 18 °C against the reservoir solution (11% polyethylene glycol 3,350 and 200 mm sodium citrate, pH 8.2). After several days, monoclinic crystals appeared and were allowed to grow for 1 week. The crystals were transferred to 50/50 Paratone-N/mineral oil for cryodata collection. Data Collection and Structure Determination of the PanK·ADP· Pantothenate Ternary Complex—Single wavelength native data were measured from a single crystal of the ternary complex with a MAR165 CCD detector operating at 100 K at the SER-CAT beamline 22-ID at the Advanced Photon Source of the Argonne National Laboratory. The data set was indexed, integrated, and scaled with the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (26Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276A: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38440) Google Scholar). The crystals belong to space group C2 with unit cell dimensions a = 181.2 Å, b = 181.7 Å, c = 47.7 Å, and β = 104.8°.

Open table in a new tab The structure of the ternary complex was determined by the molecular replacement method using one subunit of a dimer of the PanK·AMP-PNP binary complex (12Yun M. Park C.G. Kim J.Y. Rock C.O. Jackowski S. Park H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28093-28099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) as a search model. The crossrotation and translation functions and Patterson correlation refinement were calculated using the program CCP4 (27Collaborative, Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19728) Google Scholar). Data between 10.0 and 4.0 Å were used with the rotation function and generated four outstanding solutions corresponding to four PanK molecules in the asymmetric unit. Multiple iterations of applying the translation function to each solution allowed determination of the orientations and positions of the other three molecules. Each of the four PanK molecules forms a biologically functional dimer with a symmetrically related molecule. The model of all four molecules was subjected to rigid body refinement using data between 6.0 and 4.0 Å in the program CNS (28Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16947) Google Scholar). The high resolution restriction was set at 4.0 Å to allow for a possible large positional shift in the structure. The low resolution limit was set at 6.0 Å because intensities of the reflections below this resolution are severely affected by the diffraction of solvent molecules in the crystal. The R-factor at this stage was high (49%), indicating that the conformation of the PanK·ADP·pantothenate ternary complex was significantly different from that of the search model, the AMP-PNP-bound protein. Solvent contributions to low resolution intensities were considered during the first refinement. After subsequent simulated annealing (28Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16947) Google Scholar) using data between 20.0 and 2.2 Å resolution, the quality of the structure was significantly improved: the working R-factor was 34.8%; the free R-factor, 36.7%. The Fo – Fc difference map showed continuous densities for both ligands, ADP and pantothenate, that were absent from the search model, confirming the correct molecular replacement solution. Several iterations of model building in the program O (29Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar) and refinement in the program CNS (28Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16947) Google Scholar) further lowered both R-factors. The electron density map of the ADP and pantothenate ligands is shown in Fig. 2A. The final refinement statistics are shown in Table I. Because of slight differences between the four subunits, non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were applied to only 53% of the total residues for each subunit. In the final model, insufficient electron density led to substitution of several side chains with alanine: in the first molecule, residues Glu-33, Glu-44, Arg-71, Asn-83, Arg-86, Arg-119, Leu-178, Asp-185, Lys-246, Lys-264, and Glu-268; in the second molecule, residues Lys-40, Asn-83, Gln-85, Arg-86, Arg-119, Arg-120, Leu-178, Asp-185, Lys-246, and Glu-268; in the third molecule, residues Glu-33, Lys-40, Asn-83, Arg-86, Arg-119, Lys-137, and Leu-178; in the fourth molecule, residues Glu-33, Lys-40, Gln-85, Arg-86, Arg-119, Arg-120, Lys-137, Asp-185, Asp-256, Lys-264, and Glu-268. Also, several residue backbones could not be properly fit into the calculated maps: in the first molecule, residues Ser-26-Pro-28, Thr-30, Gly-84, and Gln-192; in the second molecule, residues Asp-25-Thr-30; in the third molecule, residues Asp-25-Pro-28, Gly-84, Gln-85, Ile-87, His-118, and Arg-120; in the fourth molecule, residues Ser-26-Pro-28 and Val-191. Assay of PanK—The standard PanK assays contained d-[1-14C]pantothenate (45 μm; specific activity 55 mCi/mm), ATP (100 μm), MgCl2 (10 mm), Tris-HCl (0.1 m, pH 7.5), and 100 ng of the purified PanK in a total volume of 40 μl (10Song W.J. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27051-27058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 4 μl of 10% (v/v) acetic acid to the mix. Then 40 μl of the mixture was deposited onto a Whatmann DE81 ion-exchange filter disk that was washed in three changes of 1% acetic acid in 95% ethanol (25 ml/disk; 20-min wash) to remove unreacted pantothenate. 4′-phosphopantothenate was quantitated by counting the dried disk in 3 ml of scintillation solution. A second assay was used to determine the utilization of the pantothenate analogs by PanK. The reaction mix contained pantothenate or pantothenate analog at the concentrations indicated in the figures, [γ-32P]ATP (0.25 mm; specific activity 1 Ci/mm), MgCl2 (10 mm), Tris-HCl (0.1 m, pH 7.5), and 100 ng of PanK. After incubation at 37 °C for 20 min, the reaction was stopped by adding 4 μl of 0.5 m EDTA. A 10-μl aliquot of the reaction mixture was spotted onto an activated silica gel H plate, which was developed with butanol/acetate/water (5:2:4, v/v/v). The dried plate was exposed to a storage phosphor screen, and the phosphorylated product was quantitated using ImageQuant 5.2 software (Amersham Biosciences). Synthesis of Pantothenate Analogs—The synthetic procedures were adapted from the procedure of Strauss and Begley (20Strauss E. Begley T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48205-48209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Sodium pantothenate (4.5 g, 18.6 mm) was dissolved in 20 ml of methanol and passed through an Amberlite IR-120 (H+) ion exchange column. The column was subsequently eluted with 200 ml of methanol until neutral. The elution solvent was then removed under high heat and vacuum on a rotary evaporator to complete dryness. The resulting free acid obtained in this procedure (4 g, 18.2 mm) was a viscous, straw-colored oil, which was then redissolved in 10 ml of dry dimethylformamide. The 10-ml solution was split into two 5-ml fractions and placed into 100-ml reaction vessels. To each solution an additional 10 ml of dry dimethylformamide was added. For the synthesis of N5-Pan, amylamine (1.16 ml, 10 mm) and diphenylphosphoryl azide (2.24 ml, 10 mm) were added to the first pantothenate solution. For the synthesis of N7-Pan, heptylamine (1.48 ml, 10 mm) and diphenylphosphoryl azide (2.24 ml, 10 mm) were added to the second pantothenate solution. The reaction mixtures were then cooled to 0 °C, and triethylamine (1.39 ml, 10 mm) was added to each. The reactions were stirred at 0 °C for 2 h, followed by stirring at room temperature overnight. The reaction volumes were reduced by rotary evaporation with high vacuum to remove dimethylformamide. Each of the products was then purified by flash column chromatography on silica gel using a linear elution gradient of 100:0 to 95:5 chloroform/methanol. The fractions containing each of the products were collected and concentrated in vacuo, yielding both products as white powders (1.6 g, 60% yield, and 2.1 g, 71% yield, respectively). HoPan was synthesized by dissolving 4-aminobutyric acid (4.5 g, 43.6 mm) in methanol with a excess of diethylamine (6.3 ml, 60.9 mm). The mixture was warmed for 5 min, and the solvent and excess diethylamine was removed in vacuo. The resulting diethylamine salt was redissolved in methanol (100 ml), and (R)-pantolactone (5.7 g, 43.8 mm) was added. The reaction mixture was warmed at 60 °C for 8 h and the solvent subsequently removed in vacuo. The residue was dissolved in water and applied to an Amberlite IR-120 H+ ion exchange column. The column was washed with water until neutrality. The eluate was then extracted twice with dichloromethane to remove the unreacted pantolactone, and the aqueous layer was evaporated to dryness to yield HoPan (9.2 g, 92% yield). Molecular Modeling—To investigate the binding conformation of the N5-Pan ligand, a molecular dynamics simulation was performed using the Dynamics function available with the Sybyl 6.9 molecular design software package (Tripos). The active site of the PanK enzyme was defined as all residues located within 7 angstroms of the pantothenate ligand in the crystal structure. The pantothenate ligand was extracted from the structure and modified into the N-pentyl ligand, which was then merged back into the active site. Thus, the starting conformation for the ligand in this dynamics run was essentially the same as the crystal structure, with the exception of the N-pentyl tail. PM3 charges were loaded onto the ligand, and Kollman charges were used for the enzyme. Waters that appeared to make key hydrogen bond interactions within the active site or that simulated surrounding water molecules on the surface of the enzyme were included in the simulation; all others were ignored. For this dynamics run, only the atoms and bonds of the ligand were allowed to move; all others in the enzyme and water molecules were held rigid. Thus, although the ligand was able to move and respond to the steric and electrostatic fields of the enzyme, the enzyme and water molecules could not move in return. This Dynamics simulation ran for 100 ps using the NTV ensemble, with steps every 1 fs and snapshots every 5 fs. The first 5 ps were at 100° K, the next 5 were at 300 K, the next 5 were at 700 K, and the last 85 were at 300 K. For the purposes of this Dynamics simulation, the Sybyl default values of 100 maximum iterations, 0.0001 tolerance, and 100-fs coupling were used. The system was raised to 700 K purposefully to give the ligand the necessary energy to pass through high energy conformations to achieve a lower energy conformation. The resulting solution is an average conformation of the simulation. Nucleotide Binding Site—The three-dimensional fold of PanK in the PanK·ADP·pantothenate ternary complex is almost identical to that of the protein in previously published structures (Fig. 2B) (12Yun M. Park C.G. Kim J.Y. Rock C.O. Jackowski S. Park H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28093-28099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In the PanK·ADP·pantothenate structure, ADP is bound in a groove formed by residues from the P-loop and the loop connecting strands 10/11 (Fig. 2C), similar to the location of the ATP analog in the PanK·AMP-PNP binary complex (Fig. 2D) (12Yun M. Park C.G. Kim J.Y. Rock C.O. Jackowski S. Park H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28093-28099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). A comparison of the nucleotide binding site for the PanK·ADP·pantothenate and PanK·AMP-PNP structures shows that the significant differences are the interaction of ADP with the Arg-243 side chain and the presence/absence of a bound Mg2+ ion. In the ternary complex, the side chain of Arg-243 is displaced relative to its position in the PanK·AMP-PNP structure in the direction of the nucleotide, and the guanidinium group of Arg-243 interacts with non-bridging oxygens of the ADP α- and β-phosphates (Fig. 2C). The same guanidinium group of Arg-243 in the AMP-PNP structure forms a salt-bridge interaction with non-bridging oxygen of γ-phosphate of AMP-PNP (12Yun M. Park C.G. Kim J.Y. Rock C.O. Jackowski S. Park H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28093-28099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2D). In the PanK·AMP-PNP structure, Mg2+ is coordinated by the nucleotide β- and γ-phosphates and the side chains of Ser-102 and Glu-199, suggesting the role of Mg2+ in ATP binding (Fig. 2D). However, the PanK·ADP·pantothenate structure lacks Mg2+ (Fig. 2C). A Fo – Fc difference map of ADP bound at the nucleotide binding site shows full density of the bound ADP, indicating that ADP is stably bound with high occupancy (Fig. 2A). This finding suggests that Mg2+, although necessary for ATP binding and the phosphoryl transfer reaction, is not a requirement for ADP binding. Pantothenate Binding Site—The PanK·ADP·pantothenate structure offers the first view of the pantothenate substrate bound at the active site and identifies key residues conferring pantothenate substrate specificity. The pantothenate binding site is located at the distal end of a large surface groove starting on one side of the protein, where the nucleotide binds (12Yun M. Park C.G. Kim J.Y. Rock C.O. Jackowski S. Park H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28093-28099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and continuing across the protein (Fig. 2C). Above the groove, the pantothenate binding site is bounded by α-helices H and I, which provide important contacts with the substrate. The pantothenate molecule is surrounded by hydrophilic residues, providing multiple hydrogen bonding opportunities (Fig. 3"

Expression of the GnRH gene is confined to a rare population of neurons scattered throughout the hypothalamus. Restricted expression of the rat GnRH gene is driven by a multicomponent enhancer and an evolutionarily conserved promoter. Oct-1, a ubiquitous POU homeodomain transcription factor, was identified as an essential factor regulating GnRH transcription in the GT1-7 hypothalamic neuronal cell line. In this study, we conducted a two-hybrid interaction screen in yeast using a GT1-7 cDNA library to search for specific Oct-1 cofactors. Using this approach, we isolated Pbx1b, a TALE homeodomain transcription factor that specifically associates with Oct-1. We show that heterodimers containing Pbx/Prep1 or Pbx/Meis1 TALE homeodomain proteins bind to four functional elements within the GnRH regulatory region, each in close proximity to an Oct-1-binding site. Cotransfection experiments indicate that TALE proteins are essential for GnRH promoter activity in the GT1-7 cells. Moreover, Pbx1 and Oct-1, as well as Prep1 and Oct-1, form functional complexes that enhance GnRH gene expression. Finally, Pbx1 is expressed in GnRH neurons in embryonic as well as mature mice, suggesting that the associations between TALE homeodomain proteins and Oct-1 regulate neuron-specific expression of the GnRH gene in vivo.

Tissue-specific gene expression can be mediated, in the simplest case, by a transcription factor restricted to a particular cell type. Usually, however, tissue-specific expression is achieved through unique combinations of DNA elements binding more broadly expressed proteins. This type of transcriptional regulation, termed combinatorial control, provides an efficient mechanism integrating responses to a variety of signals using a relatively limited number of proteins (1Wolberger C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 552-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We investigated the mechanisms underlying neuron-specific transcription of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) 1The abbreviations used are: GnRH, gonadotropin-releasing hormone; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; GST, glutathione S-transferase; dnPrep1, dominant-negative Prep1; GnRHe, GnRH enhancer; RSVp, Rous sarcoma virus promoter; DAB, 3,3′-diaminobenzidine; dpc, days postcoitus; GnRHp, GnRH promoter; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside. gene. GnRH is the decapeptide hormone that regulates secretion of the pituitary gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone, thereby mediating central nervous system control of reproductive function (2Vale W. Rivier C. Brown M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1977; 39: 473-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The GnRH-secreting neurons are a small population of highly specialized cells dispersed throughout the hypothalamus that release GnRH in a pulsatile manner. We have previously developed an immortalized cultured cell model system for GnRH neurons, the GT1-7 cell line, by targeted oncogenesis (3Mellon P.L. Windle J.J. Goldsmith P. Pedula C. Roberts J. Weiner R.I. Neuron. 1990; 5: 1-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). These cells are hypothalamic neurons that secrete GnRH and therefore provide an appropriate model for defining the molecular mechanisms for neuron-specific gene expression. Previously, we established that neuron-specific activation of the rat GnRH gene is conferred, in culture and in vivo, by two upstream regulatory elements: an enhancer (–1863 to –1571) and an evolutionarily conserved promoter (–173 to +1) (4Eraly S.A. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 848-859Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Whyte D.B. Lawson M.A. Belsham D.D. Eraly S.A. Bond C.T. Adelman J.P. Mellon P.L. Mol.

Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1404-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Within these sequences is a complex arrangement of binding sites for trans-acting factors that potentiate transcription. However, single binding elements are not sufficient to confer GT1-7 cell-specific expression to reporter genes in transient transfection assays, demonstrating that coordinate action from multiple elements is required for GnRH transcription. Several factors have been shown to regulate GnRH cell-specific transcription, including the homeodomain proteins Oct-1 (7Clark M.E. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6169-6177Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), SCIP/Oct-6 (8Wierman M.E. Xiong X. Kepa J.K. Spaulding A.J. Jacobsen B.M. Fang Z. Nilaver G. Ojeda S.R. Mol. Cell.

Mellon, submitted for publication.; and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-β (12Belsham D.D. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 212-228PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, the POU homeodomain protein Oct-1 was identified as an essential factor regulating basal and hormone-induced transcription of the GnRH gene (7Clark M.E. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6169-6177Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 9Wolfe A. Kim H.H. Tobet S. Stafford D.E. Radovick S. Mol.

Hager G.L. DeFranco D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2372-2378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Oct-1 binds to five elements within the rat GnRH regulatory region and is necessary for enhancer activity in GT1-7 cells (7Clark M.E. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6169-6177Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Mutation of the Oct-1 site at –1781 to –1774, within the enhancer, decreases basal transcription to 5% (5Whyte D.B. Lawson M.A. Belsham D.D. Eraly S.A. Bond C.T. Adelman J.P. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 467-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, Oct-1 plays a critical role in GnRH gene expression. A paradox that remains to be explained, however, is that Oct-1 and the other GnRH regulatory proteins identified thus far have been detected in a variety of cell types, whereas the GnRH gene is expressed only in hypothalamic GnRH neurons and the cell line representing them, GT1-7. A possible explanation is that GT1-7 cells may contain a neuron-specific Oct-1 coactivator. Oct-1 is not known to be a strong transcriptional activator by itself; however, in conjunction with coactivators, it can promote potent tissue-specific transactivation of target genes (14Strubin M. Newell J.W. Matthias P. Cell. 1995; 80: 497-506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 15Gstaiger M. Knoepfel L. Georgiev O. Schaffner W. Hovens C.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 360-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Alternatively, Oct-1 may interact with other DNA-binding proteins that are neuron-specific (16Voss J.W. Wilson L. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1309-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In this study, we used a two-hybrid interaction screen in yeast to search for Oct-1 cofactors in GT1-7 cells. This approach led us to the isolation of the TALE homeodomain transcription factor Pbx1b. We show that TALE homeodomain proteins specifically associate with Oct-1. Furthermore, we demonstrate a role for this interaction in the activation of GnRH gene expression. The findings in GT1-7 cells are likely relevant to the regulation of GnRH expression in vivo since Pbx1 is expressed in embryonic as well as mature GnRH neurons in mice. Two-hybrid Interaction Screen in Yeast—To isolate cDNAs encoding GT1-7 proteins that associate with Oct-1, we first created a randomly primed GT1-7 cDNA library (using poly(A+) mRNA) fused C-terminally to the transactivation domain of the VP16 protein. The yeast strains and expression vectors were the generous gifts of Dr. Michel Strubin and have been described previously (14Strubin M. Newell J.W. Matthias P. Cell. 1995; 80: 497-506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). In this library vector, the hybrid proteins are expressed in yeast from a centromeric TRP1 plasmid under the control of a galactose-inducible promoter. The yeast tester strain also contains a centromeric bait plasmid carrying the URA3 gene and the human Oct-1 cDNA. A chromosomal copy of the selectable marker, the HIS3 gene, under the control of six copies of the octamer motif serves as the genomic target for Oct-1. The GT1-7 cDNA library (3 × 106 primary transformants) was introduced into the reporter strain using the method of Schiestl and Gietz (17Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1773) Google Scholar), except that the lithium acetate solution contained 1 m sorbitol and that sheared herring testis DNA (10 mg/ml) (Clontech) was used as carrier DNA. After induction of the library proteins, cells were plated on synthetic galactose medium lacking histidine and containing 10 mm 3-aminotriazole and incubated for 10 days. Eighty-nine URA+/TRP+ 3-aminotriazole-resistant colonies were plated on medium containing 5-fluoroorotic acid to select against cells expressing Oct-1 from the URA3 plasmid. Seven URA–/TRP+ colonies that lost their ability to grow on 3-aminotriazole when their Oct-1 plasmid was removed were recovered from the yeast using the method of Robzyk and Kassir (18Robzyk K. Kassir Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3790Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The DNA sequences of the 22 library plasmids recovered from these colonies were determined by the chain termination method (19Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52653) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides—The double-stranded consensus oligonucleotides used in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) analysis included the Oct-1 consensus oligonucleotide (TGTCGAATGCAAATCACTAGAA, top strand) (7Clark M.E. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6169-6177Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), the PBX oligonucleotide (AGCGCGGGGCGCATCAATCAATTTCG, top strand), and the PBX-mut oligonucleotide (AGCGCGGGGCGCATCAATTAATTTCG, top strand) (20Lu Q. Knoepfler P.S. Scheele J. Wright D.D. Kamps M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3786-3795Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The sequences of the GnRH oligonucleotides are shown in Fig. 3. The top and bottom strands of the –75 oligonucleotide correspond to GnRH sequences –109 to –94 and –104 to –89, respectively. All oligonucleotides were synthesized by Operon Technologies, Inc. EMSA—Nuclear extracts were prepared according to the method described by Schreiber et al. (21Schreiber E. Merchant R.E. Wiestler O.D. Fontana A. Neurosurgery (Baltimore). 1994; 34: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Annealed wild-type and mutant oligonucleotides (20 ng or 1 pmol) containing sequences of the GnRH enhancer or promoter or consensus sequences were phosphorylated with [γ-32P]dATP (6000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and polynucleotide kinase or filled in with [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and Klenow fragment using standard procedures (22Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar). Probes were phenol/chloroform-extracted and passed over Sephadex G-25 micro-columns (Amersham Biosciences), and radioactivity was counted with a scintillation counter. Probes were diluted in 50 mm NaCl. Binding reactions were carried out under conditions described previously (7Clark M.E. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6169-6177Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Each probe (1 fmol) was incubated with 2 μg of GT1-7 crude nuclear extract in 20-μl reactions. Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 5 min and separated on 5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.25× Tris borate/EDTA as described previously (7Clark M.E. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6169-6177Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Competitions were performed by preincubating the reactions with a 100–200-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide for 5 min on ice prior to adding the probe. Supershift assays were performed by adding 1 μl of antibody or rabbit IgG control to the complete reaction and then incubating as described above. The antibodies used were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., except anti-Meis1 antibody (a generous gift of Dr. Michael L. Cleary) and the antibody directed against all Pbx forms (21Schreiber E. Merchant R.E. Wiestler O.D. Fontana A. Neurosurgery (Baltimore). 1994; 34: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Gels were run at 250 V for 2 h and then dried under a vacuum and exposed to film for 1–3 days. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed as described previously (23Coss D. Jacobs S.B. Bender C.E. Mellon P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 152-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), with a few modifications. Chromatin from GT1-7 or LβT2 cells was cross-linked for 10 min using formaldehyde. The resulting chromatin solution was precipitated with Pbx1, Prep1, and Oct-1 polyclonal antibodies. The following day, chromatin·antibody complexes were isolated from the solution by incubation with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (50% slurry, pre-blocked with 100 μg/ml sonicated Escherichia coli DNA and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) while being rocked at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were harvested and washed as described previously (23Coss D. Jacobs S.B. Bender C.E. Mellon P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 152-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Cross-linking was reversed by addition of NaCl to a final concentration of 300 mm and incubation overnight at 65 °C. Chromatin·antibody complexes were eluted from the Sepharose beads by addition of 10% SDS and proteinase K and subsequent incubation at 37 °C. The DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, and dissolved in Tris/EDTA. Immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed for the GnRH promoter sequence by PCR. Protein Production and GST Retention Assay—Expression vectors used for protein production included full-length human Oct-1 and the POU domain of Oct-1 in the pCR2.1 vector and the human Prep1, Meis1, and Pbx cDNAs (including various deletions) in pGEM vectors. In vitro transcription and translation were performed with the Promega TnT coupled reticulocyte lysate system following the manufacturer's protocol, employing SP6, T7, or T3 polymerase. [35S]Methionine was used for labeling the protein products. Translation mixture without DNA was used as a control for unprogrammed translation in the reticulocyte lysate. GST-Oct-1 was created by cloning the human Oct-1 cDNA into the pGEX-4T1 vector. Bacteria transformed with the pGEX vectors were grown to an absorbance of 0.5 and then induced overnight with 0.2 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Bacterial pellets were sonicated in 0.1% Triton X-100 and 5 mm EDTA in 1× phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged, and the supernatant was bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (Amersham Biosciences). The interaction assay was performed as described previously (24González-Crespo S. Morata G. Development (Camb.). 1995; 121: 2117-2125PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were separated using a 10% SDS gel, after which the gel was fixed, soaked in Amplify (Amersham Biosciences), dried, and exposed to Eastman Kodak X-BioMax film at –80 °C or to a PhosphorImager (Bio-Rad) at room temperature. Cell Culture and Transfection—All cells were grown in monolayer culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 4.5 mg/ml glucose in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were transfected with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) in 24-well multidishes. GT1-7 cells from only passages 5–10 were used for the transactivation experiments. The expression plasmids used for cotransfections included human dominant-negative Prep1 (dnPrep1) in a pCMV vector; human Oct-1 Prep1, Pbx1b, and Meis1 in pcDNA1.1 vectors; and the negative control vectors pCMV and pcDNA1.1. The reporter plasmids contained the GnRH enhancer (GnRHe; –1863 to –1571) fused to the Rous sarcoma virus promoter (RSVp) (GnRHe-RSVp) and GnRHe-RSVp containing a TGAATGATAG → TGAATctTAG mutation in the –1749 Pbx/Prep1-binding site, each in a pGL3 vector driving luciferase expression. GT1-7 cells were transfected with 100 ng of expression plasmid, 400 ng of reporter plasmid, and 200 ng of internal control (herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase –109 promoter on β-galactosidase). Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, lysed, and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase expression as described previously (25Delegeane A.M. Ferland L.H. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3994-4002Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In Situ Hybridization and Immunohistochemistry—Adult mice were perfused with Zamboni's fixative (4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.4)) as described in detail previously (26Simmons D.M. Voss J.W. Ingraham H.A. Holloway J.M. Broide R.S. Rosenfeld M.G. Swanson L.W. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 695-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Their brains were removed and post-fixed overnight. The forebrains and midbrains were then sliced coronally on a microtome in 30-μm sections and stored in potassium phosphate-buffered saline. One series of sections was incubated with anti-Pbx1 antibody at 1:1000 dilution and subsequently underwent a nickel reaction. Next, the sections were incubated with anti-GnRH antibody (LR1; a gift of R. Benoit) and subsequently underwent a 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) reaction (peroxidase substrate kit, Vector Laboratories). Sections were mounted, dried, cover-slipped with synthetic distyrene plasticizer xylene resin (DPX; Electron Microscopy Sciences), and visualized by light microscopy. These sections identify Pbx1 by black staining and GnRH by brown staining. Mouse embryos were removed at 13.5 days postcoitus (dpc) and embedded in optimal cutting temperature medium (OCT; VWR Scientific) or paraffin-embedded and sectioned at 7–10 μm thickness. The series of frozen sliced embryo sections carrying rat GnRHe-GnRHp driving the β-galactosidase transgene (6Lawson M.A. MacConell L.A. Kim J. Powl B.T. Nelson S.B. Mellon P.L. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1404-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) was subjected to X-gal reaction (1 mg/ml X-gal dissolved in Me2SO, 1× phosphate-buffered saline, 4 mm ferrocyanide, 4 mm ferricyanide, and 2 mm MgCl2) and incubated with anti-Pbx1 antibody and DAB as described above. These sections identify Pbx1 by brown staining and β-galactosidase by blue staining. Paraffin-embedded wild-type embryos were deparaffinized with xylene washes, hydrated in ethanol/water solutions, and digested with proteinase K for 7 min at 37 °C, followed by post-fixation in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 20 min at room temperature. The sections were washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and 2× SSC for 5 min and then hybridized with digoxigenin-labeled sense and antisense probes for Pbx1 or Oct-1. The digoxigenin-labeled probes were added to a slide at a dilution of 1:1000 in hybridization buffer (150 μl/section; 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 1 mg/ml yeast RNA, 50 × Denhardt's, 200 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm Tris base, 9 mm Tris hydrochloride, 5 mm sodium phosphate, 2.5 mm EDTA, in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water) and incubated overnight at 65 °C. Sections were washed four times at 65 °C with 50% formamide, 1× SSC, and 0.1% Tween 20 and then twice at room temperature with 100 mm maleic acid, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween. The slides were blocked with 5% normal goat serum and 0.1% Tween 20 for 3–4 h. The hybridized digoxigenin-labeled probe was detected using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody (Roche Applied Science) at a dilution of 1:2000 and visualized with the chromogen combination 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium chloride. Antisense and sense probes were created by incubating 1 μg of linearized plasmid DNA with 10× digoxigenin RNA labeling mixture (Roche Applied Science) as well as 5× transcription buffer (Promega) and T7, T3, or SP6 RNA polymerase for 2 h at 37 °C. The Homeodomain Protein Pbx1b Interacts with Oct-1 in a Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—To understand the mechanism by which the ubiquitous transcription factor Oct-1 specifies GnRH expression, we searched for Oct-1 cofactors expressed in the GT1-7 cell line. For this purpose, we created a GT1-7 cDNA library with a C-terminal fusion to the VP16 transactivation domain for use in a yeast two-hybrid system developed especially to screen for Oct-1-interacting proteins, which led to the isolation of the B-cell-specific transcriptional coactivator OBF-1/Bob-1 (14Strubin M. Newell J.W. Matthias P. Cell. 1995; 80: 497-506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). One of the cDNAs, isolated by this method, encoded a known transcription factor, mouse Pbx1b. Pbx1b belongs to the PBC subclass of the TALE (three-amino acid loop extension) homeodomain proteins. The mammalian Pbx family is composed of Pbx1a, Pbx1b, Pbx2, Pbx3a, and Pbx3b (Pbx1b and Pbx3b are alternatively spliced short forms) (27Mann R.S. Chan S.K. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 258-262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). These proteins have been shown to regulate gene expression through cooperative interaction with other DNA-binding proteins such as Hox (27Mann R.S. Chan S.K. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 258-262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) and with the TALE homeodomain proteins Meis (28Chang C.P. Jacobs Y. Nakamura T. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Cleary M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5679-5687Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) and Prep (29Berthelsen J. Zappavigna V. Mavilio F. Blasi F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1423-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Therefore, we considered Pbx1b a suitable candidate for an Oct-1-interacting protein. Multiple TALE Homeodomain Proteins Are Expressed in GT1-7 Cells—The Pbx proteins are expressed in many tissues and cell lines (30Monica K. Galili N. Nourse J. Saltman D. Cleary M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6149-6157Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Having identified Pbx1b in our yeast two-hybrid screen, we next examined which Pbx family members are expressed in our model cell line, the GT1-7 cells. The presence of Pbx mRNAs and proteins was determined in several cell lines and tissues by Northern and Western blot analyses. These analyses revealed that both variants of Pbx1 mRNAs were expressed in GT1-7 cells (data not shown). We further observed, using a series of Pbx-specific antibodies, that the Pbx1b protein was abundant in GT1-7 nuclear extracts compared with the other Pbx family members (Pbx1a, Pbx2, and Pbx3a) and with Pbx1b expression in mouse hypothalamus and the mouse fibroblast cell line NIH3T3 (Fig. 1A). The EL4 cell line served as a negative control for Pbx1b expression (30Monica K. Galili N. Nourse J. Saltman D. Cleary M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6149-6157Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Since Pbx transcriptional activity has been shown to be dependent on cooperative interaction with other TALE homeodomain proteins, Meis (28Chang C.P. Jacobs Y. Nakamura T. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Cleary M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5679-5687Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 31Knoepfler P.S. Calvo K.R. Chen H. Antonarakis S.E. Kamps M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14553-14558Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and Prep (Pknox) (29Berthelsen J. Zappavigna V. Mavilio F. Blasi F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1423-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 31Knoepfler P.S. Calvo K.R. Chen H. Antonarakis S.E. Kamps M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14553-14558Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), we investigated the presence of these Pbx partners in GT1-7 cells. Western blot analysis with specific antibodies showed that the Prep1 and Meis1 proteins were highly expressed in GT1-7 nuclear extracts compared with their expression in other cell lines (Fig. 1B). Thus, in addition to confirming the presence of Pbx proteins, two other TALE homeodomain proteins, Meis and Prep, were also detected in our cell model for GnRH neurons. These data suggest that TALE proteins (in particular, Pbx1b) are available for complex formation with Oct-1 in GT1-7 cells. Pbx1 and Prep1 Proteins Form Complexes with Oct-1 in Vitro —The isolation of Pbx1b in a yeast two-hybrid screen for Oct-1-interacting protein suggests that Pbx1 forms a protein complex with Oct-1 independent of DNA binding. To verify this interaction, as well as to explore a potential interaction between Oct-1 and the Pbx1 partner Prep1, a pull-down approach was utilized with GST fusion proteins (Fig. 1C). Bacterial extracts expressing GST-Oct-1 or GST were mixed with glutathione-Sepharose beads. The beads with absorbed fusion protein were subsequently incubated with in vitro translated 35S-labeled proteins. As expected, according to the demonstrated interactions between POU domain proteins (16Voss J.W. Wilson L. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1309-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), GST-Oct-1 specifically bound to the Oct-1 protein. It also bound to the Pbx1b protein, but not to the green fluorescent protein, which was used as a negative control. Intriguingly, GST-Oct-1 also specifically interacted with Prep1 (Fig. 1C). No binding was observed when proteins were incubated with GST alone. These data confirm that the Pbx1b and Prep1 proteins interact with Oct-1 in vitro. To ascertain the domains of Pbx1 and Prep1 that serve for the interaction with Oct-1, the pull-down experiments were repeated with various domains of Pbx1b and Prep1. Two Pbx1 mutant proteins were used to map the interface between Pbx1 and Oct-1. To test the contribution of the N-terminal domain of Pbx1b, the naturally occurring Pbx mutant E2A-Pbx1b (32Kamps M.P. Murre C. Sun X.H. Baltimore D. Cell. 1990; 60: 547-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar) was used. This oncogenic fusion protein contains the transactivation domain of the E2A protein substituting for the first 88 residues of Pbx1 (Fig. 1D). In addition, we used a Pbx1b mutant protein lacking 75 N-terminal amino acids (PbxΔNT3). Fig. 1C shows that both Pbx1 mutant proteins specifically bound GST-Oct-1. These data indicate that the N-terminal region of Pbx1b is not essential for the interaction with Oct-1. To determine which region of the Prep1 protein provides the major contribution to the protein-protein interaction with Oct-1, two deletions were made. The deletion in the N-terminal region removed the Meis homologous regions 1 and 2 (Prep1ΔHR), which were previously shown to be important for protein-protein interactions with Pbx proteins (37Berthelsen J. Zappavigna V. Ferretti E. Mavilio F. Blasi F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1434-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The deletion in the C-terminal region removed the Prep1 homeodomain (Prep1ΔHD) (Fig. 1D). Fig. 1C indicates that GST-Oct-1 specifically bound Prep1 lacking the N-terminal domain, but not the Prep1 lacking the homeodomain. These data suggest that sequences located in the DNA-binding domain of Prep1 serve for the interaction with Oct-1.

However, to date, no direct evidence has been reported for the role of Glu-151 during catalytic turnover by AAP. In order to elucidate the catalytic role of Glu-151, altered AAP enzymes have been prepared in which Glu-151 has been substituted with a glutamine, an alanine, and an aspartate. The Michaelis constant (Km) does not change upon substitution to aspartate or glutamine, but the rate of the reaction changes drastically in the following order: glutamate (100% activity), aspartate (0.05%), glutamine (0.004%), and alanine (0%). Examination of the pH dependence of the kinetic constants kcat and Km revealed a change in the pKa of a group that ionizes at pH 4.8 in recombinant leucine aminopeptidase (rAAP) to 4.2 for E151D-AAP. The remaining pKa values at 5.2, 7.5, and 9.9 do not change. Proton inventory studies indicate that one proton is transferred in the rate-limiting step of the reaction at pH 10.50 for both rAAP and E151D-AAP, but at pH 6.50 two protons and general solvation effects are responsible for the observed effects in the reaction catalyzed by rAAP and E151D-AAP, respectively. Based on these data, Glu-151 is intrinsically involved in the peptide hydrolysis reaction catalyzed by AAP and can be assigned the role of a general acid and base.

Based on these data, Glu-151 is intrinsically involved in the peptide hydrolysis reaction catalyzed by AAP and can be assigned the role of a general acid and base. Hydrolases that contain co-catalytic metallo-active sites play important roles in numerous biological processes including hormone regulation, insulin degradation, neurological function, and antibiotic resistance (1Holz R.C.

Within this group, several have been crystallographically characterized, such as the leucine aminopeptidases from Aeromonas proteolytica (Vibrio proteolyticus) (AAP), 1The abbreviations used are: AAP, leucine aminopeptidases from A. proteolytica; rAAP, recombinant leucine aminopeptidase; l-pNA, l-leucine-p-nitroanilide; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; Tricine, (N-tris[hydroxymethyl]methylglycine; WT, wild type. 1The abbreviations used are: AAP, leucine aminopeptidases from A. proteolytica; rAAP, recombinant leucine aminopeptidase; l-pNA, l-leucine-p-nitroanilide; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; Tricine, (N-tris[hydroxymethyl]methylglycine; WT, wild type.

Enzymes with active sites that are superimposable on AAPs, such S. griseus aminopeptidase, the d-aminopeptidase from Bacillus subtilis (DppA), the dapE-encoded N-succinyl-l,l-diaminopimelic acid desuccinylase (DapE), the argE-encoded N-acetyl-l-ornithine deacetylase (ArgE), carboxypeptidase G2, and glutamate carboxypeptidase II, sometimes referred to as N-acetylated α-linked acidic dipeptidase, all play important roles in living organisms (1Holz R.C. Bzymek K. Swierczek S.I. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2003; 7: 197-206Google Scholar, 2Holz R.C. Coord. Chem. Rev. 2002; 232: 5-26Google Scholar, 6Velasco A.M. Leguina J.I. Lazcano A. J. Mol.

For instance, because of the location of glutamate carboxypeptidase II in the central and peripheral nervous systems, it is believed to play a critical role in modulating the release of glutamate (9Thomas A.G. Olkowski J.L. Vornov J.J. Slusher B.S. Brain Res. 1999; 843: 48-52Google Scholar, 10Robinson M.B. Blakely R.D. Couto R. Coyle J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14498-14506Google Scholar). The role of N-acetylaspartylglutamate has been extensively studied, and among other functions, it serves as a negative modulator of glutamatergic neurotransmission (11Slusher B.S. Vornov J.J. Thomas A.G. Hurn P.D. Harukuni I. Bhardwaj A. Traystman R.J. Robinson M.B. Britton P. Lu X.C. Tortella F.C. Wozniak K.M. Yudkoff M. Potter B.M. Jackson P.F. Nat.

There is also mounting evidence that N-acetylaspartylglutamate is involved in neuropsychiatric disorders associated with the dysregulation of glutamatergic neurotransmission, such as schizophrenia, seizure disorders, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (15Passani L.A. Vonsattel J.P. Carter R.E. Coyle J.T. Mol. Chem. Neuropathol. 1997; 31: 97-118Google Scholar). For this reason, these metallohydrolases have become the subject of intense efforts in inhibitor design (16Pulido-Cejudo G. Conway B. Proulx P. Brown R. Izaguirre C.A. Antiviral Res. 1997; 36: 167-177Google Scholar). AAP possesses ideal properties for the study of hydrolysis reactions catalyzed by co-catalytic metal centers (17Prescott J.M. Wilkes S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1976; 45: 530-543Google Scholar). AAP is a small monomeric enzyme (32 kDa.) that contains two g atoms of Zn(II) per mol of polypeptide, is thermostable for several hours at 70 °C, can be obtained in large quantities (>100 mg), and can be genetically manipulated (2Holz R.C. Coord. Chem. Rev. 2002; 232: 5-26Google Scholar, 17Prescott J.M. Wilkes S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1976; 45: 530-543Google Scholar). 2K. P. Bzymek, V. M. D'souza, G. Chen, H. Campbell, A. Mitchell, and R. C. Holz, submitted for publication. 2K. P. Bzymek, V. M. D'souza, G. Chen, H. Campbell, A. Mitchell, and R. C. Holz, submitted for publication. AAP has been crystallographically characterized and possesses a (μ-aqua)(μ-carboxylato)dizinc(II) core with a terminal carboxylate and histidine residue coordinated to each metal ion (19Chevrier B. Schalk C. D'Orchymont H. Rondeau J.-M. Moras D. Tarnus C. Structure. 1994; 2: 283-291Google Scholar). Both zinc ions reside in a distorted tetrahedral coordination geometry with a Zn-Zn distance of 3.5 Å. In addition, several x-ray crystal structures of inhibited forms of AAP have been reported (20De Paola C.C. Bennett B. Holz R.C. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9048-9053Google Scholar, 21Stamper C. Bennett B. Edwards T. Holz R.C. Ringe D. Petsko G. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7034-7046Google Scholar, 22Desmarais W. Bienvenue L.D. Bzymek K. Holz R.C. Petsko A.G. Ringe D. Structure. 2002; : 1063-1072Google Scholar). The native Zn(II) ions can be replaced with other metal ions in a sequential fashion, providing highly active forms of the enzyme (23Bennett B. Holz R.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 1923-1933Google Scholar). That the metal ions can be sequentially replaced to yield specific heterodimetallic forms of the enzyme has proved extremely useful in mechanistic studies involved in probing the roles of each individual metal ion (2Holz R.C. Coord. Chem. Rev. 2002; 232: 5-26Google Scholar). Whereas AAP is not a specific target for pharmaceuticals at this time, a detailed understanding of its mechanism is still quite important with regard to other metallohydrolases that contain co-catalytic active sites that are drug targets (1Holz R.C. Bzymek K. Swierczek S.I. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2003; 7: 197-206Google Scholar, 2Holz R.C. Coord. Chem. Rev. 2002; 232: 5-26Google Scholar, 3Lowther W.T. Matthews B.W. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4581-4607Google Scholar). For these reasons, AAP is one of the best mechanistically characterized hydrolytic enzymes with a co-catalytic metallo-active site (2Holz R.C. Coord. Chem. Rev. 2002; 232: 5-26Google Scholar). Comparison of one and two metal-containing peptidases with known x-ray crystal structures reveals some common features for both mono- and dinuclear hydrolases (24Lipscomb W.N. Sträter N. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2375-2433Google Scholar, 25Vallee B.L. Auld D.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5647-5659Google Scholar, 26Vallee B.L. Auld D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2715-2718Google Scholar, 27Vallee B.L. Auld D.S. Biochemistry. 1993; : 6493-6500Google Scholar). All have at least one bound water molecule and many contain an active site carboxylate residue that does not function as a metal ligand. This carboxylate residue, usually a glutamate, often forms a hydrogen bond to a water molecule that is also bound to an active site metal ion. The x-ray crystal structure of AAP reveals that an oxygen atom of Glu-151 forms a hydrogen bond with a water molecule that bridges the two Zn(II) ions (19Chevrier B. Schalk C. D'Orchymont H. Rondeau J.-M. Moras D. Tarnus C. Structure. 1994; 2: 283-291Google Scholar). Glu-151 has been proposed to act as the proton shuttle during catalytic turnover, but no direct evidence has been reported to substantiate this hypothesis (22Desmarais W. Bienvenue L.D. Bzymek K. Holz R.C. Petsko A.G. Ringe D. Structure. 2002; : 1063-1072Google Scholar). In order to gain insight into the catalytic role of Glu-151, we have prepared the E151D, E151Q, and E151A altered AAP enzymes and characterized each by kinetic and spectroscopic methods. These data suggest that Glu-151 functions as the general acid/base during the hydrolysis of N-terminal polypeptides by AAP. Protein Expression and Purification—All chemicals used in this study were purchased from commercial sources and were of the highest quality available. The plasmid encoding the 51-kDa form of AAP (pVS-NMC) (28Zhang Z.-Z. Nirasawa S. Nakajima Y. Yoshida M. Hayashi K. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 671-676Google Scholar)2 was obtained from Prof. Kiyoshi Hayashi. Growth conditions, processing, and purification of the recombinant protein were prepared as described previously.2 Site-directed Mutagenesis—Altered forms of AAP were obtained by PCR mutagenesis using the following primers: 5′-TG GCT TAT GCC GCT XXX GAA GTC GGC TTG CGTG-3′ and 5′-CACG CAA GCC GAC TTC YYY AGC GGC ATA AGC CA-3′ with GCG, GAC, CAG for XXX and CGC, GTC, CTG for YYY of E151A, E151D, and E151Q mutants, respectively. Site-directed mutants were obtained using the QuickChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) following the manufacturer's procedures. Reaction products were transformed into Escherichia coli XL1-Blue competent cells (recA1 endA1 gyrA96 thi-1 hsdR17supE44 relA1 lac [F′ proAB lacIqZΔM15 Tn10 (Tetr)]), grown on LB-agarose plates containing kanamycin at a concentration of 50 μg/ml. A single colony of each mutant was grown in 50 ml of LB containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin. Plasmids were isolated using Wizard Plus Minipreps DNA purification kit (Promega, Madison, WI) or Qiaprep® Spin Miniprep kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Each mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing (Utah State University Biotechnology Center). Plasmids containing the altered AAP genes were transformed into E. coli BL21 Star™ (DE3) (F– ompT hsdSB (r –Bm –B) gal dcm rne131 (DE3)) (Invitrogen) (28Zhang Z.-Z. Nirasawa S. Nakajima Y. Yoshida M. Hayashi K. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 671-676Google Scholar).2 Enzymatic Assay—Recombinant and Glu-151-altered forms of AAP were assayed for catalytic activity using l-leucine-p-nitroanilide (l-pNA) as the substrate (17Prescott J.M. Wilkes S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1976; 45: 530-543Google Scholar). In this assay, the hydrolysis of l-pNA was measured spectrophotometrically by monitoring the formation of p-nitroaniline at 405 nm (ϵ = 10,800 m–1 cm–1). All assays were performed on a Shimadzu UV-3101PC spectrophotometer equipped with a constant temperature cell holder and an Isotemp 2013D water bath (Fisher). Enzyme concentrations were determined from the absorbance at 280 nm with the value ϵ280 = 43,950 m–1 cm–1 (29Prescott J.M. Wilkes S.H. Wagner F.W. Wilson K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 1756-1764Google Scholar). All assays were performed at 25 ± 0.1 °C in 10 mm Tricine buffer (pH 8.0) with 0.1 mm ZnSO4, unless stated otherwise. pH Profiles—The enzymatic activity of rAAP and the E151D form of AAP at pH values between 4.5 and 10.75 was measured using l-pNA as the substrate. The conditions and methods used were identical to those described by Baker and Prescott (30Baker J.O. Prescott J.M. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 5322-5331Google Scholar). Briefly, the concentration of each buffer used was 10 mm, and the following buffers were used: carbonate (pH 10.75); borate (pH 8.50–10.50); Tricine (pH 7.00–8.50); MOPS (pH 6.50–7.00); MES (pH 5.50–6.50); acetate (pH 4.50–5.50). No additional Zn(II) was included in any of the buffers listed above pH 8.50. Between pH 6.00 and 8.50, 0.1 mm Zn(II) was included in all the buffers. At pH values below 6.0, three buffers were prepared at each pH that contained different concentrations of Zn(II) (typically ranging between 0.1 and 10 mm), to ensure that Zn(II) depletion did not affect the kinetic measurements. The kinetic parameters kcat, Km, and kcat/Km were determined by using 8–12 different substrate concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 10.0 times the observed Km value at each pH studied. Kinetic parameters and fits to the kinetic curves were obtained using Igor Pro (Wavemetrix Inc., Lake Oswego, OR) by fitting the experimental data to the appropriate equations. Solvent Isotope Effect—All buffers were prepared from a freshly opened bottle of 99.9% [2H]H2O (Aldrich). The buffers and Zn(II) salts used in the preparation of all deuterated buffers were in the anyhydrous form. The buffer used for measurements at pH 10.50 (10 mm carbonate) did not contain any Zn(II) because Zn(II) hydroxide precipitates under these conditions. The buffer used at pH 6.50 (10 mm MES) contained 0.5 mm ZnCl2 to ensure that no Zn(II) depletion would occur during the experiment. The pH of each buffer used was adjusted by the addition of NaOD or DCl (both 99%+ deuterium content; Acros Organics, Geel, Belgium) and corrected for deuteration by adding 0.4 to the reading of the pH electrode. Apoenzyme Preparation—Purified and concentrated protein (10–20 mg/ml) was incubated with 10–15 mm disodium EDTA at 4 °C until no activity was observed (usually 1–3 days). To remove the EDTA, the protein was dialyzed extensively against 100 times the volume of metal-free (chelexed) 50 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.5). The activity of the dialyzed protein was less than 1% of the activity of the protein reconstituted with 2 eq of Zn(II). All plasticware used for dialysis and the dialysis tubing was presoaked in a disodium EDTA/bicarbonate solution to remove all traces of metals and then extensively washed with 18 ohm nanopure water (NANOpure Ultra Pure Water System, Barnstead/Thermolyne, IA) and chelexed HEPES buffer (pH 7.5). Spectroscopic Measurements—Electronic absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-3101PC spectrophotometer. All solutions used were degassed prior to the experiment. Apo-rAAP (typically 1 mm) was incubated with Co(II) (CoCl2, ≥99.999% Acros Organics, Geel, Belgium) for ∼10 min at 25 °C. Apoprotein absorbance was subtracted from the spectra obtained with Co(II) using Igor Pro (Wavemetrix Inc., Lake Oswego, OR). Kinetic Studies on rAAP and Altered-AAP Enzymes—The Km and kcat values for rAAP, E151D-AAP, and E151Q-AAP were obtained by directly fitting the observed data to the Michaelis-Menten equation (Table I).2 The observed kcat values for E151D-AAP and E151Q-AAP were 1.9 × 102 and 2.7 104 times slower, respectively, than WT AAP (10 mm Tricine buffer (pH 8.0), 0.2 m KCl, 0.1 mm ZnSO4). Most interesting, the observed Km values for E151D-AAP and E151Q-AAP do not change significantly upon the substitution of the glutamate. When Glu-151 is replaced with a residue that cannot transfer a proton (E151A), no activity is observed.Table IComparison of the observed kinetic parameters for rAAP and Glu-151-AAPrAAPE151QE151AE151DKm (μm)14.3 ± 0.418.8 ± 2.317.8 ± 0.3Specific activity (units/mg)aThe assays were performed in 10 mm Tricine buffer (pH 8.0), 0.2 m KCl, and 0.1 mm ZnSO4 using l-pNA as the substrate.126 ± 10.005 ± 1 × 10-40.069 ± 0.003kcat (min-1)4280 ± 420.160 ± 0.005NDbND, none detected.2.24 ± 0.01a The assays were performed in 10 mm Tricine buffer (pH 8.0), 0.2 m KCl, and 0.1 mm ZnSO4 using l-pNA as the substrate.b ND, none detected. Open table in a new tab Metal Binding Properties of E151D AAP—Electronic absorption spectra of the E151D-altered AAP enzyme were recorded in the presence of 1 and 2 eq of Co(II) ([Co_(E151D-AAP)] and [CoCo(E151D-AAP)]) (Fig. 1). The addition of 1 eq of Co(II) to E151D-AAP at pH 7.5 provides a visible absorption spectrum with a λmax value of 525 nm (ϵ525 ∼25 m–1 cm–1). Addition of a 2nd eq of Co(II) increases the molar absorptivity at 525 nm to ∼45 m–1 cm–1. The addition of more than 2 eq of Co(II) does not alter the position of the observed absorption band but increases the molar absorptivity to ∼85 m–1 cm–1 after the addition of 6 eq of Co(II) (Fig. 1). Plots of molar absorptivity at 525 nm versus equivalents of Co(II) (Fig. 2) allowed the Co(II) dissociation constants for the first (Kd1) and second (Kd2) metal-binding sites to be obtained by fitting the electronic absorption titration data to Equation 1 (31Winzor D.J. Sawyer W.H. Quantitative Characterization of Ligand Binding. Wiley-Liss, New York1995Google Scholar), r=p(Kd1⋅CS/(1+Kd1⋅CS))+q(Kd2⋅CS/(1+Kd2⋅CS))(Eq. 1) where p and q are the number of sites; CS is the free metal concentration; and r is the binding function that was calculated by conversion of the fractional saturation (r = fa × p) as described previously (32D'souza V.M. Bennett B. Copik A.J. Holz R.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3817-3826Google Scholar). The free metal concentration was calculated from Equation 2, CS=CTS−rCA(Eq. 2) where CTS and CA are the total molar concentrations of metal and enzyme, respectively. The best fit obtained exhibited p and q values of one and Kd1 and Kd2 values of 95 + 15 and 400 + 50 μm for Co(II) binding to the first and second metal-binding sites of E151D AAP, respectively. pH Dependence of the Kinetic Parameters—In order to further characterize the role of Glu-151 in the catalytic mechanism of AAP, the kinetic parameters Km, kcat, and kcat/Km were recorded as a function of pH for both rAAP and E151D-AAP (Figs. 3 and 4). Loss of Zn(II) from AAP has been shown to occur at pH values lower than 6.0 (30Baker J.O. Prescott J.M. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 5322-5331Google Scholar), due to ionization of the metal ligands in the active site of AAP. To prevent the decrease of activity at lower pH due to Zn(II) depletion and thus erroneous analysis of pH dependence plots, at pH values of 6.0 and below data were collected at three different Zn(II) concentrations. This ensures the presence of saturating amounts of Zn(II) so the equilibrium is shifted toward the formation of Zn(II)-enzyme complex. Kinetic parameters were obtained from reciprocal plots of 1/kcat versus 1/[Zn] and 1/Km versus 1/[Zn] by extrapolation of the kinetic parameters to saturating Zn(II) concentrations, as described in detail by Baker and Prescott (30Baker J.O. Prescott J.M. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 5322-5331Google Scholar).Fig. 4pH dependence of the observed kinetic parameters for the hydrolysis of l-pNA by E151D-AAP.

Rev. 2002; 232: 5-26Google Scholar). In addition, the goodness of the fits to the kinetic data suggests that the proposed model accurately approximates the changes observed at various pH values. Fits of the pH dependence of logKm to Equation 4 for rAAP (Fig. 3A) revealed inflection points at 4.8, 5.3, 7.5, and 9.9 identical to that reported by Baker and Prescott (30Baker J.O. Prescott J.M. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 5322-5331Google Scholar) for WT AAP. For E151D-AAP, four inflection points were also observed but at 4.2, 5.0, 7.5, and 10.0 (Fig. 4A). Based on fits of logkcat, no change in kcat was observed for rAAP in the pH range 7.0–10.75, but a sharp drop in kcat was observed below pH values of 6.0 with a single inflection at 5.2 (Fig. 3B), identical to that reported by Baker and Prescott (30Baker J.O. Prescott J.M. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 5322-5331Google Scholar) for WT AAP. Similar changes were observed for E151D-AAP and provided a pKa value of 5.2, identical to that of rAAP (Fig. 4B). A plot of logkcat/Km versus pH for rAAP, fit to Equation 6, shows one inflection point in the acidic range at pH 5.0, one in the basic range at pH 9.9, and a free substrate ionization at pH 7.4 (Fig. 3C). An identical plot for E151D-AAP, revealed inflection points at pH 4.2 and pH 9.9 along the free substrate ionization at pH 7.5 (Fig. 4C). Based on the proposed model, the remaining kinetic parameters, KS and kp, describe the substrate binding step and the rate constant of the rate-limiting step, respectively. The average value of KS for rAAP and E151D-AAP obtained from fits to Equations 4 and 6, was 10.8 and 11.2 μm, respectively. The kinetic constant kp, calculated using Equation 5, was 72 s–1 for rAAP and 0.038 s–1 for E151D-AAP (Table I). kp values obtained from these fits are essentially the same as the experimentally derived kcat, at pH 8.0. Solvent Isotope Effect Studies—The solvent isotope effect for both rAAP and E151D-AAP was determined using l-pNA as the substrate at pH values of 6.50 and 10.50 (44Bienvenue D.L. Mathew R.S. Ringe D. Holz R.C. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2002; 7: 129-135Google Scholar). These data were plotted as atom fraction of deuterium versus Vn/VD, where Vn is equal to the kcat value obtained at a particular fraction of deuterium, whereas VD is kcat in buffer containing 100% deuterium oxide (Figs. 5 and 6). Proton inventories were obtained by fitting the experimental data to equations derived from the Gross-Butler Equation 7, Vn/V0=∏iVT(1−n+niT)∏iVR(1−n+nϕjR)(Eq. 7) where n is the atom fraction of deuterium; Vn is the observed velocity at n fraction of deuterium; V0 is the observed velocity in water (H2O); vT is the number of protons transferred in the transition state; vR is the number of protons transferred in the reactant state, and ϕ is the fractionation factor defined as Equation 8, ϕ=(XiD/XiH)/(n/(1−n))(Eq. 8) where XDi and XHi are the mole fractions of deuterons and protons in the ith transition or reactant state whereas the subscripts T and R refer to the transition and reactant state, respectively (45Albery W.J. Gold V. Caldin E. Proton Transfer Reactions. Chapman and Hall Ltd., London1975: 263Google Scholar, 46Venkatasubban K.S. Schowen R.L. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 17: 1-44Google Scholar). At pH 10.50, the best fit obtained exhibited a straight line (Fig. 5), suggesting the involvement of one proton in the catalytic reaction. However, at pH 6.50, the data significantly deviate from linearity, and the best fit obtained required a polynomial function, suggesting at least two protons are transferred in the transition state at this pH. Because the largest deviation for theoretical proton inventory curves occurs at atom fractions of 0.5 (47Elrod J.P. Hogg J.L. Quinn D.M. Venkatasubban K.S. Schowen R.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 3917-3922Google Scholar), calculation of a mid-point partial solvent isotope effect often helps in determining the number of protons involved in the catalytic reaction. The following equations, derived by Elrod et al. (47Elrod J.P. Hogg J.L. Quinn D.M. Venkatasubban K.S. Schowen R.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 3917-3922Google Scholar), allowed the calculation of mid-point partial solvent isotope effects when the experimental data were obtained at different atom fractions. For a one-proton reaction (Equation 9), Vm/V1=(1−nm)(V0/V1)+nm(Eq. 9) whereas a two-proton reaction (equal isotope effects) can be written as Equation 10, Vm/V1=((1−nm)(V0/V1)1/2+nm)2(Eq. 10) and generalized solvation changes can be determined using Equation 11: Vm/V1=(V0/V1)(1−nm)(Eq. 11) where nm is atom fraction of deuterium with velocity Vm. The experimental and calculated mid-point partial isotope effects are presented in Table II. At pH 10.50, comparison of the theoretical and experimental mid-point partial isotope effects suggests that one proton is transferred at this pH. On the other hand, at 6.5 the mid-point partial isotope effects observed for rAAP suggest two protons are transferred, whereas general solvation changes likely dominate for E151D-AAP at this pH value. Because Km was found to be independent of pH in the range 10.1–10.5 under the conditions used, D(kcat/Km) values were calculated for rAAP (1.7) and E151D-AAP (1.9).Fig. 6Plots of proton inventory and log(kn) versus atom fraction of deuterium for E151D-AAP at pH 6.50.

Scott I.C. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8749-8759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We reported previously the surprising findings that C-propeptides of pro-α1(V) chains in either α1(V)3 or α1(V)2α2(V) trimers are cleaved by furin-like proprotein convertases, whereas BMP-1 cleaves at a specific site within pro-α1(V) NH2-terminal globular sequences (48Imamura Y.

Processing at similar sites and by similar proteinases appears to hold for pro-α1(XI) as well (11Pappano W.N. Steiglitz B.M. Scott I.C. Keene D.R. Greenspan D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4428-4438Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 52Medeck R.J. Sosa S. Morris N. Oxford J.T. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 361-368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Putative furin recognition sites in pro-α2(XI) and pro-α3(V) telopeptides suggest that the C-propeptides of these chains may also be cleaved by furin-like proteinases, although the question has not been addressed experimentally. However, although residues flanking the BMP-1 cleavage site in pro-α1(V) NH2-terminal sequences are conserved in the NH2-terminal sequences of pro-α1(XI) and pro-α2(XI), such conservation is lacking in pro-α3(V) (49Unsöld C.

Thus, it remains to be determined whether pro-α3(V) NH2-terminal globular sequences are processed and, if so, at which site(s), and by what type of proteinase(s). Here we address experimentally in vitro and in vivo processing of the pro-α3(V) chain and the question of whether the pro-α2(V) N-propeptide is susceptible to cleavage by ADAMTS-2. Production of Recombinant Pro-α1(V)2Pro-α2(V) and Pro-α1(V)Pro-α2(V)Pro-α3(V) Heterotrimers—For production of recombinant pro-α1(V)2pro-α2(V) heterotrimers, a previously described full-length human pro-α1(V) cDNA (48Imamura Y.

T-REx-293 cells (Invitrogen) were transfected as described below and serially selected for neomycin and zeocin resistance. For production of recombinant pro-α1(V)pro-α2(V)pro-α3(V) heterotrimers, the full-length human pro-α1(V) cDNA (48Imamura Y. Steiglitz B.M. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol.

A full-length human pro-α3(V) cDNA was then assembled from previously described human pro-α3(V) cDNAs (36Imamura Y. Scott I.C. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8749-8759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) by separately subcloning cDNA fragments corresponding to the 5′- and 3′-halves of pro-α3(V) cDNA into pBluescript II KS+, excising the 5′-cDNA with NotI and KpnI and the 3′-cDNA with KpnI and BssHII, and inserting the two pieces together between the NotI and MluI sites of the pro-α1(V) cDNA-containing pBudCE4.1 vector. The resulting vector thus expresses both pro-α1(V) and pro-α3(V) mRNAs, transcribed via two separate promoters. The pro-α2(V) cDNA-containing pcDNA4/TO/myc-His Zeo construct described above was cleaved with AgeI, then filled with dCTP using the Klenow fragment, and subsequently cut with AflII. The resulting full-length pro-α2(V) cDNA was then inserted into a pcDNA5/TO vector (Invitrogen) that had been cut with Bsp120I, filled with dGTP using the Klenow fragment, and subsequently cut with AflII. These vectors were cotransfected into T-REx-293 cells, as described below, and then selected for zeocin and hygromycin resistance. T-REx-293 cell cultures maintained in complete medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1 mm l-glutamine, antibiotic-antimycotic (Invitrogen), and 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone)) were transfected with the constructs described above, using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). In each case, cells were transfected first with the appropriate pro-α2(V) expression construct, followed by selection for resistance to the corresponding antibiotic, ring cloning, and screening of individual clones, after induction with tetracycline, for pro-α2(V) expression by immunoblot, using anti-α2(V) polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Clonal lines expressing the highest levels of pro-α2(V) were then transfected either with the pC1-neo/pro-α1(V) expression vector or with the pBudCE4.1/pro-α1(V)/pro-α3(V) expression vector, followed by selection for resistance to the corresponding antibiotic, ring cloning, and screening of individual clones for pro-α1(V) expression by immunoblot, using previously described (49Unsöld C.

Clonal lines expressing the highest levels of pro-α1(V) chains were then tested for production of either pro-α1(V)2pro-α2(V) or pro-α1(V) pro-α2(V)pro-α3(V) heterotrimers, after induction with tetracycline, by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. T-REx-293 clones expressing highest levels of pro-α1(V)2pro-α2(V) or pro-α1(V)pro-α2(V)pro-α3(V) heterotrimers were incubated with 50 μg/ml ascorbate for 20 h before induction of collagen production. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), then incubated in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 45 min, rewashed with PBS, and then incubated in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 50 μg/ml ascorbate, and 1 mm tetracycline (Sigma) in the absence or presence of 100 mm l-arginine or 20 μm highly specific furin inhibitor decanoyl-RVKR-chloromethyl ketone (Bachem), as noted in the text. Conditioned media were recovered 24 h later and replaced with fresh media for a second harvest after an additional 24 h. Protease inhibitors were added to collected media to final concentrations of 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and 1 mm p-aminobenzoic acid; media were centrifuged to remove debris and were then stored at -70 °C. Stored samples were thawed and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.6, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and 1 mm p-aminobenzoic acid at 4 °C, as described previously (48Imamura Y.

Precipitates were collected by centrifugation at 65,000 × g for 30 min, and pellets were resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl). Pepsinization—Pro-α1(V)2pro-α2(V) and pro-α1(V)pro-α2(V)pro-α3(V) heterotrimers were subjected to digestion with 100 μg/ml pepsin (Sigma) in 0.5 n acetic acid, pH 2.0, for 6 h at 4 °C. The reaction was stopped by neutralizing with a final concentration of 0.5 m NaOH and by adding pepstatin to a final concentration of 30 μg/ml. Pepsin-resistant collagen chains were precipitated with ethanol and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblots—Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and subsequently electrotransferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore) as described previously (54Lee S. Solow-Cordero D.E. Kessler E. Takahara K.

Blots were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in T-PBS (PBS and 0.05% Tween) for 2 h and incubated with primary antibody at a 1:6,000 dilution for anti-α1(V) antibodies, 1:5,000 for anti-α2(V) antibodies, and 1:4,000 for anti-α3(V) antibodies. Blots were washed with T-PBS and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in T-PBS followed by incubation with secondary antibodies at 1:5,000 dilution. After eight washes with T-PBS, blots were incubated for 5 min in SuperSignal West Pico substrate (Pierce) and exposed to Scientific Imaging film (Kodak). Affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies raised against the variable domain of pro-α1(V) have been described previously (49Unsöld C. Pappano W.N. Imamura Y. Steiglitz B.M. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol.

Carey (Sigfried and Janet Weis Center for Research). Immunoprecipitation—Pro-α1(V)pro-α2(V)pro-α3(V) heterotrimers were immunoprecipitated with anti-α3(V) antibody using essentially the same methodology as described by Scott et al. (17Scott I.C.

Briefly, 500 ng of recombinant protein, precipitated under low salt conditions from conditioned media (see above), was incubated either with protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) or with protein A-Sepharose beads prebound to antibody against the rat P200 α3(V) homolog. Proteins bound to the beads were eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 5% acrylamide gels followed by Western blot analysis with anti-α1(V), anti-α2(V), and anti-α3(V) antibodies.

Recombinant BMP-1 produced by this line was purified, as described previously (10Scott I.C. Blitz I.L. Pappano W.N. Imamura Y. Clark T.G. Steiglitz B.M. Thomas C.L. Maas S.A. Takahara K. Cho K.W.Y.

Translin-associated factor X (TRAX) was identified as a protein that interacts with TB-RBP and is dependent upon TB-RBP for stabilization. Using immunohistochemistry to investigate the subcellular locations of TB-RBP and TRAX during spermatogenesis, both proteins localize in nuclei in meiotic pachytene spermatocytes and in the cytoplasm of subsequent meiotic and post-meiotic cells. An identical subcellular distribution is seen in female germ cells. Western blot analysis of germ cell protein extracts reveals an increased ratio of TRAX to TB-RBP in meiotic pachytene spermatocytes compared with the post-meiotic round and elongated spermatids. Using COS-1 cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from TB-RBP null mice as model systems to examine the shuttling of TB-RBP and TRAX, we demonstrate that TRAX contains a functional nuclear localization signal and TB-RBP contains a functional nuclear export signal. Coexpression of both proteins in COS-1 cells and TB-RBP-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts reveals that the ratio of TRAX to TB-RBP determines their subcellular locations, i.e. increased TRAX to TB-RBP ratios lead to nuclear localizations, whereas TRAX remains in the cytoplasm when TB-RBP levels are elevated. These subcellular distributions require interaction between TB-RBP and TRAX. We propose that the subcellular locations of TB-RBP and TRAX in male germ cells are modulated by the relative ratios of TRAX and TB-RBP.

Spermatogenesis is the dynamic developmental process in the testis where the male gamete differentiates into spermatozoa. Following spermatogonial proliferation and differentiation, recombination occurs during meiosis and haploid daughter cells are produced from the two meiotic divisions. This is followed by spermiogenesis where the haploid cells mature into spermatozoa. Throughout spermatogenesis, many testis-specific and testis-enriched mRNAs are temporally and spatially expressed in a tightly controlled manner (1Braun R.E. Int. J.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11261-11270Google Scholar) as a protein that interacts with TB-RBP. TRAX is a 33-kDa protein that shows high amino acid sequence homology to TB-RBP (20Aoki K. Ishida R. Kasai M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 401: 109-112Google Scholar). Like TB-RBP, TRAX is also highly expressed in testis and brain, but does not bind nucleic acids directly (10Chennathukuzhi V. Kurihara Y. Bray J.D. Hecht N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13256-13263Google Scholar). TRAX contains a putative bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) and a leucine zipper domain (10Chennathukuzhi V.

The leucine zipper domain of TRAX is essential for interactions with not only TB-RBP but also with C1D, an activator of the DNA-dependent protein kinase involved in the repair of DNA-double strand breaks and V(D)J recombination (22Erdemir T.

Although the function of TRAX is unknown, it has been postulated that TRAX complexed with translin is involved in dendritic RNA processing (24Finkenstadt P.M. Kang W.S. Jeon M. Taira E. Tang W.

Underkoffler L.A. Loomes K. Hecht N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12605-12614Google Scholar). In the absence of TB-RBP, TRAX is ubiquitinated and degraded (25Yang S. Cho Y.S. Chennathukuzhi V.M. Underkoffler L.A. Loomes K. Hecht N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12605-12614Google Scholar). The official nomenclature for the mouse TRAX gene is Tsnax.The location of a protein is often indicative of its function (26Gasca S. Canizares J. de Santa Barbara P. Mejean C. Poulat F. Berta P. Boizet-Bonhoure B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11199-11204Google Scholar, 27Moore J.D. Kirk J.A. Hunt T. Science. 2003; 300: 987-990Google Scholar). RNA-binding proteins that participate in post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA frequently exhibit a dynamic subcellular distribution between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (28Shyu A.-B. Wilkinson M.F. Cell. 2000; 102: 135-138Google Scholar, 29Vera Y. Dai T. Sinha Hikim A.P. Lue Y. Salido E.C. Swerdloff R.S. Yen H. J. Androl. 2002; 23: 622-628Google Scholar). Many nucleocytoplasmic shuttling proteins contain both a nuclear localization signal and a nuclear export signal, domains that are recognized by specific receptors and adaptors in nuclear pore complexes (30Gama-Carvalho M. Carmo-Fonseca M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 157-163Google Scholar, 31Macara I.G. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 1-25Google Scholar). Translin/TB-RBP contains a leucine-rich nuclear export signal that may be dependent on the CRM1 cellular export receptor for subcellular movement (10Chennathukuzhi V. Kurihara Y. Bray J.D. Hecht N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13256-13263Google Scholar, 32Henderson B.R. Eleftheriou A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 213-224Google Scholar, 33Stade K. Ford C.S. Guthrie C. Weis K. Cell. 1997; 90: 1041-1050Google Scholar), whereas TRAX contains putative bipartite nuclear sequences suggesting an involvement of TRAX in the nuclear transport of translin/TB-RBP (20Aoki K. Ishida R. Kasai M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 401: 109-112Google Scholar).To gain insight into the cellular movements of TB-RBP and TRAX during spermatogenesis, we have investigated their subcellular localizations in mouse testes and have used COS-1 cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) from TB-RBP null mice as model systems to investigate protein shuttling. Immunohistochemistry demonstrates that both proteins are in the nuclei of pachytene spermatocytes and in the cytoplasm of diplotene/diakinesis spermatocytes and the post-meiotic spermatids. An identical subcellular distribution is seen in female germ cells. Transfecting COS-1 cells and TB-RBP-deficient MEFs, we find that the NLS of TRAX and the NES of TB-RBP are functional and provide a means for the two proteins to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm as a complex. Moreover, the ratio of TB-RBP to TRAX determines the “steady state” subcellular locations of the two proteins.MATERIALS AND METHODSImmunohistochemistry—Testes from adult male mice and ovaries from pregnant females at days 16 and 18 post-coitum were fixed and processed by the Histological Core Facility of the Children's Hospital of Pennsylvania and the Jackson Laboratory. Immunohistochemistry was performed as previously described (13Morales C.R. Wu X.-Q. Hecht N.B. Dev. Biol. 1998; 201: 113-123Google Scholar, 34Gu W. Wu X.-Q. Meng X.H. Morales C.R. El-Alfy M. Hecht N.B. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1998; 49: 219-228Google Scholar).Preparation of Testis and Germ Cell Extracts—Total testis extracts were prepared from adult and 17-day-old male CD-1 mice (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) using a modification of the procedure of Wu et al. (35Wu X.-Q. Gu W. Meng X. Hecht N.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5640-5645Google Scholar). Testes were decapsulated, washed with phosphate-buffered saline buffer, and resuspended in 300 μl of RIPA buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin. Testes were homogenized in a Teflon glass homogenizer on ice until most of cells were lysed and homogenates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 15 min. The supernatants were stored at –80 °C until use. Testicular germ cells were separated by STA-PUT centrifugation as previously described (36Travis A.J. Foster J.A. Rosenbaum N.A. Visconti P.E. Gerton G.L. Kopf G.S. Moss S.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 263-276Google Scholar).Western Blot Analyses—For protein analyses of mouse testes, aliquots from total testis (10 μg) or germ cell extracts (70 μg) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Whole cell lysates from COS-1 cells and TB-RBP-deficient MEFs were prepared in RIPA buffer as previously described (37Munshi N. Groopman J.E. Gill P.S. Ganju R.K. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1169-1174Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined with a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce). For Western blotting, proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and anti-TB-RBP antibody (1:10,000 dilution) and anti-TRAX antibody (1:1,000 dilution) were used as primary antibodies. TB-RBP and TRAX were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein A (1:3,000 dilution) and the enhanced chemiluminescent (ECL) detection kit (Amersham Biosciences).Plasmid Construction—The open reading frame of wild type TB-RBP was amplified by PCR and subcloned to generate the expression plasmid pEGFP-TB-RBP (10Chennathukuzhi V. Kurihara Y. Bray J.D. Hecht N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13256-13263Google Scholar). Wild type mouse TRAX cDNA was obtained by RT-PCR from testis RNA and inserted into pEGFP-C2 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) to generate the expression plasmid pEGFP-TRAX. To create mutated forms of TB-RBP and TRAX expression plasmids as well as coexpression plasmids, wild type or mutated forms of TB-RBP and TRAX were amplified by PCR and inserted into plasmids, pEGFP-C2 or pIRES (Clontech) using restriction enzyme sites introduced with PCR primers. For the NES deletion form of TB-RBP, the plasmid was constructed by insertion of two PCR products (one for amino acids 1–145 and the other for 158–228) into the multiple cloning sites of pEGFP-C2, which resulted in replacing the entire NES with two amino acids, glycine and threonine. To make the leucine zipper (LZ) deletion form of TRAX, the PCR-mediated mutagenesis method (38Yang S. Sun Y. Zhang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4889-4893Google Scholar) was applied using two sets of primers, 5′-GCCATGAACGGCAAAGAAGGACCA-3′ and 5′-CATGTCTTCCCCCGATATCTCCTCCATA-3′ for the amplification of the upstream open reading frame from the LZ and 5′-GATATGGAGGAGATATCGGGGGAAGACATGC-3′ and 5′-GCCTTAAGAAATGCTCTCTTCCTGATC-3′ for the downstream open reading frame from the LZ. Both amplified PCR products lack the LZ but contain an overlapping sequence (about 30 bp) by which two PCR products can be partially annealed and used as the template for the second round of PCR to generate the LZ deletion form of TRAX. All constructs were sequenced before use.

For transient transfections of COS-1 cells and TB-RBP-deficient MEFs, FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol. When leptomycin B (LMB) (3 ng/ml) was used, it was added to the transfected COS-1 cell cultures 4 h before fixation. For fluorescence microscopy, cells grown on two-well chamber slides (Lab-Tek, Champbell, CA) were fixed using methanol and mounted using 95% glycerol in phosphate-buffered saline. Green fluorescent (GFP) fusion proteins in the transfected COS-1 cells and TB-RBP-deficient MEFs were detected by fluorescence microscopy and their subcellular locations were confirmed following 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole counterstaining. Similar subcellular distributions were obtained with other fixation methods (4% paraformaldehyde).RESULTSTB-RBP and TRAX Are in Nuclei of Meiotic Pachytene Spermatocytes and in the Cytoplasm of Subsequent Germ Cells—To help define the cellular roles of TB-RBP and TRAX during spermatogenesis, we have investigated by immunostaining the subcellular steady state locations of both proteins in mouse testes using affinity purified antibodies to TB-RBP and TRAX (Fig. 1A). As previously shown (13Morales C.R. Wu X.-Q. Hecht N.B. Dev. Biol. 1998; 201: 113-123Google Scholar, 18Chennathukuzhi V. Stein J.M. Abel T. Donlon S. Yang S. Miller J.P. Allman D.M. Seykora J. Simmons R.A. Hecht N.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6419-6434Google Scholar), TB-RBP is localized in the nuclei of pachytene spermatocytes and in the cytoplasm of subsequent cell types (Fig. 1A, a and b). A more detailed analysis of the stages of meiotic prophase after pachytene reveals TB-RBP rapidly appears in the cytoplasm in diplotene/diakinesis cells where it remains in the post-meiotic round spermatids (Fig. 1A, c). TRAX shows a similar pattern of nuclear localization in pachytene spermatocytes and cytoplasmic localization in later stage male germ cells (Fig. 1A, d and f).A similar pattern of subcellular localization of TB-RBP is seen in female germ cells. At the time mouse oocytes are in pachytene (day 16 post-coitum) (Fig. 1B, a), TB-RBP is in nuclei, whereas at day 18 post-coitum (Fig. 1B, b) when oocytes are arrested in diplotene/diakinesis, TB-RBP is in the cytoplasm. These data suggest that TB-RBP and TRAX have nuclear functions in pachytene-stage meiotic germ cells and cytoplasmic functions in subsequent meiotic and post-meiotic germ cells. The change in subcellular location of both proteins in the testis germ cells as the germ cells differentiate raises the possibility of a coordinated shuttling of proteins between the nucleus and cytoplasm in mouse germ cells.The TRAX to TB-RBP Ratio Is Increased in Pachytene Spermatocytes—Extracts from testes of 17-day-old mice and from adult mice were prepared for Western blotting and analyzed for TB-RBP and TRAX using anti-TB-RBP and anti-TRAX (Fig. 2A). The testes of 17-day-old mice contain pachytene spermatocytes, but lack post-meiotic germ cells. The ratio of TRAX to TB-RBP was increased in testes of 17-day-old mice compared with the testes of adult mice (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2Western blot of subcellular fractions and cell types from mouse testes. A, TB-RBP and TRAX in the total testis extract from 17-day-old (17d) and adult (A) mice. Total protein (10 μg) from total testis extract was separated by a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. B, TB-RBP and TRAX in enriched populations of male germ cells. PS, pachytene spermatocytes; RS, round spermatids; ES, elongated spermatids; and MGC, mixed germ cells. Total protein (70 μg) from each cell type was separated by a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. C, quantitation of relative amounts of TRAX and TB-RBP in B was performed by densitometry using ImageQuant software. Similar quantitations were obtained with additional blots.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To more precisely compare the ratio of TRAX to TB-RBP in germ cells where the two proteins are predominately either in nuclei or cytoplasm, we quantitated the level of TB-RBP and TRAX in Western blots of enriched populations of pachytene spermatocytes, round spermatids, elongated spermatids, and mixed germ cells (Fig. 2, B and C). Although similar amounts of TB-RBP are seen in all the cell types, pachytene spermatocytes contain a higher relative amount of TRAX compared with TB-RBP than the other germ cell types examined. The post-meiotic cell types (round and elongated spermatids) maintain similar levels of TB-RBP, but lower amounts of TRAX relative to TB-RBP.TRAX Is in Nuclei and TB-RBP in the Cytoplasm in Singly Transfected COS-1 Cells—To determine whether the subcellular localization of TB-RBP could be influenced by TRAX, COS-1 cells were used as a model system. Plasmid constructs expressing TB-RBP and TRAX fused to GFP were individually transfected into COS-1 cells. In transfected COS-1 cells, TRAX is predominantly nuclear (about 91%) (Fig. 3A) with the remaining transfected cells showing both nuclear and cytoplasmic localization of GFP-TRAX (Table II). This is in agreement with previous findings (23Erdemir T. Bilican B. Oncel D. Goding C.R. Yavuzer U. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 207-216Google Scholar).Fig. 3Subcellular localization of GFP-TRAX and GFP-TB-RBP in COS-1 cells. COS-1 cells transfected with pEGFP-TRAX (A), pEGFP-TRAX(–NLS) (C), and pEGFP-TB-RBP (E) are shown in the left panels.

After transfection into COS-1 cells, TRAX-NLS remained in the cytoplasm (about 94%), suggesting that the NLS is needed for TRAX to move to the nucleus (Fig. 3C, Table II).In contrast to GFP-TRAX, GFP-TB-RBP is mostly in the cytoplasm (about 96%) (Fig. 3E, Table II), consistent with previous observations that TB-RBP contains a functional leucine-rich NES (10Chennathukuzhi V. Kurihara Y. Bray J.D. Hecht N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13256-13263Google Scholar). To determine whether the predominantly cytoplasmic localization of GFP-TB-RBP in the transfected COS-1 cells resulted from the export of TB-RBP from nuclei, LMB, the inhibitor for the cellular export receptor CRM1, was added to the COS-1 cell cultures 4 h before fixation. Leptomycin B treatment did not change the subcellular distribution of GFP-TB-RBP in the transfected COS-1 cells (Table II), suggesting that TB-RBP had not shuttled out of the nucleus. Thus, the cytoplasmic localization of GFP-TB-RBP could result from insufficient levels of TRAX for the GFP-TB-RBP in the transfected COS-1 cells, preventing the formation of GFP-TB-RBP complexes that could move into the nucleus.TB-RBP Translocation to the Nucleus Is Dependent upon TRAX—Because TB-RBP and TRAX interact forming oligomeric complexes via their leucine zipper domains (21Wu X.-Q. Lefrancois S. Morales C. Hecht N.B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11261-11270Google Scholar, 23Erdemir T. Bilican B. Oncel D. Goding C.R. Yavuzer U. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 207-216Google Scholar) and TRAX is dependent upon TB-RBP for its cellular stabilization (25Yang S. Cho Y.S. Chennathukuzhi V.M. Underkoffler L.A. Loomes K. Hecht N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12605-12614Google Scholar), we reasoned that TB-RBP could translocate to the nucleus as a complex dependent upon the NLS of TRAX. To test whether GFP-TB-RBP could be transported into nuclei by increasing the amount of TRAX in the transfected COS-1 cells, we utilized a coexpression plasmid, pTRAX-IRES-EGFP-TB-RBP, which allows the expression of two consecutive open reading frames from one mRNA. In plasmid pTRAX-IRES-EGFP-TB-RBP, the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) is located between two open reading frames of TRAX and GFP-TB-RBP (Fig. 4A, a). Because of a partially disabled IRES sequence, the rate of translation initiation of the second open reading frame is reduced to about 20% of the first open reading frame. Therefore, in the plasmid pTRAX-IRES-EGFP-TB-RBP we obtained attenuated expression of the second gene, GFP-TB-RBP, compared with TRAX (Fig. 4B, lane 5). When relatively high levels of TRAX are produced, about 37% of transfected COS-1 cells show nuclear localization of GFP-TB-RBP, 46.5% cytoplasmic, and 16.5% show both nuclear and cytoplasmic localization (Fig. 4C, a, Table II), suggesting that TRAX enhances the translocation of TB-RBP into the nucleus. Furthermore, when these transfected cells were incubated with leptomycin B, the percentage of cells showing nuclear localization of GFP-TB-RBP increased to about 87% (Fig. 4C, c, Table II). This indicates that export of GFP-TB-RBP from the nucleus is the reason about half of the cell"

We also found that p90 RSK directly phosphorylates CREB on Ser-133 following BCR cross-linking and is positioned downstream of nPKCδ.

The cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) is a 43-kDa protein belonging to the CREB/ATF bZip family of transcription factors. It binds to a consensus TGANNTCA cAMP-response element (CRE) as a homo- or heterodimer with other CREB/ATF and activator protein-1 transcription factor members (17Yamamoto K.K. Gonzalez G.A. Wiggs B.H. Montminy M.R. Nature. 1988; 334: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of CREB on Ser-133 increases its association with the CREB-binding protein, leading to activation of the basal transcriptional machinery (17Yamamoto K.K. Gonzalez G.A. Wiggs B.H.

CREB phosphorylation and CRE-dependent gene expression occurs in response to BCR cross-linking of resting B cells (19Muthusamy N. Leiden J.M. J. Biol.

Accumulating evidence suggests that CREB plays an important role in B cell growth and survival. Phosphorylation of CREB is necessary for activation of the BCR-dependent c-fos/jun-B immediate-early growth response program (20Amato S.F. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Chiles T.C. J.

In particular, transgenic mice expressing a mutant CREB containing a serine-to-alanine substitution at position 133 exhibit impaired proliferation and survival in response to BCR cross-linking (24Zhang C.-Y.

In regard to the latter, CREB phosphorylation is necessary for bcl-2 gene expression in human B cells (25Wilson B.E. Mochon E. Boxer L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5546-5556Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). In addition, CREB has been implicated in the regulation of numerous gene promoters involved in B cell function, including the 3′ κ enhancer, major histocompatibility complex class II promoter, OCA-B promoter, and human Iγ1 proximal promoter (26Pongubala J.M.

Despite the importance of CREB phosphorylation in B cell function, there remain many fundamental questions concerning the mode of regulation of CREB by the BCR. One of these questions related to the role of PKC in linking the BCR to CREB phosphorylation. Nearly a decade ago a phorbol ester (PMA)-sensitive PKC activity was shown to be required for BCR-induced CREB phosphorylation in B cells (21Xie H. Rothstein T.L. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 1717-1723PubMed Google Scholar, 31Xie H. Wang Z. Rothstein T.L. Cell. Immunol. 1996; 169: 264-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In contrast, several known CREB kinases, including inducible protein kinase A (PKA) and calmodulin kinase II (CaMK II) activities, do not contribute to CREB phosphorylation in mature B cell responses to BCR cross-linking (31Xie H. Wang Z. Rothstein T.L. Cell. Immunol. 1996; 169: 264-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Although these observations suggest an important contribution of PKC to CREB phosphorylation, the identity of the PKC isoform(s) has not been established. Furthermore, the signaling components that link PKC activity to CREB phosphorylation remain to be defined. In the work described herein, we have made use of pharmacological activators and inhibitors of c/nPKC isoforms, nPKCδ-deficient mice, A20 B cells expressing a kinase-inactive nPKCδ, and DT40 B cell lines deficient in signalosome components to define the signaling pathways that regulate CREB phosphorylation in mature B cells. Our results show that BCR cross-linking mediates CREB phosphorylation via a signaling pathway involving nPKCδ and p90 RSK.

The murine A20 B lymphoma was kindly provided by Dr. Jeffery V. Ravetch (Rockefeller University, New York). Stable A20 cell lines were generated by culturing at a density of 5 × 105 cells/1 ml RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) containing 3 μg of plasmid DNA/6 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. A20 cells were stably transfected with pMTH plasmids constitutively expressing either wild type nPKCδ or a mutant nPKCδ containing a substitution (K376R) in the ATP-binding site that resulted in a kinase-inactive nPKCδ as described previously (32Romanova L.Y.

Stable transfectants were selected in culture medium containing G418 (Mediatech, Herndon, VA).

CBA/CaJ and BALB/c mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) and housed at Boston College. Mice were cared for and handled at all times in accordance with National Institutes of Health and institutional guidelines. Splenic B cells were purified by depletion of T cells with anti-Thy-1.2 plus rabbit complement; macrophages (and other adherent cells) were removed by plastic adherence (20Amato S.F. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Chiles T.C. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 146-155PubMed Google Scholar). Red blood cells and nonviable cells were removed by sedimentation on Lympholyte M. Splenic B lymphocytes were purified from nPKCδ–/– mice as described previously (33Mecklenbräuker I. Saijo K. Zheng N.-Y. Leitges M. Tarakhovsky A. Nature. 2002; 416: 860-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar); the generation of nPKCδ-null mice on C57Bl/6 background has been described (33Mecklenbräuker I. Saijo K. Zheng N.-Y. Leitges M. Tarakhovsky A. Nature. 2002; 416: 860-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The resulting B cell populations were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 2 mm l-glutamine, 5 × 10–5m 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.25 μg/ml fungizone, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Splenic B cells were maintained in a 37 °C humidified incubator at 5% CO2. Western Blotting—B cells were solubilized in modified RIPA buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1% SDS) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4 and supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture. Lysate protein was separated by electrophoresis through an SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane. The membrane was blocked in TBS-T (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat dry milk for 5 h and then incubated overnight (4 °C) with primary Ab at 1 μg/ml in TBS-T. The membrane was washed several times in TBS-T and then incubated with a 1:2500 dilution of anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG-coupled horseradish peroxidase Abs for 90 min and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence. Autoradiograms were analyzed by densitometry using a Bio-Rad GS-800 Calibrated Densitometer and Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). In Vitro Kinase Assay—Approximately 2.0 × 107 B cells were collected by centrifugation, washed once in 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and solubilized in a lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were then incubated for 18 h at 4 °C with anti-phospho-p90 RSK (Ser-380) Ab that recognizes activated p90 RSK (Cell Signaling Technology). Immune complexes were collected with a 40-μl slurry of protein A/G-agarose beads and washed six times with lysis buffer. Kinase reactions were carried out at 30 °C for 30 min in 20 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 5 mm MnCl2, 200 μm Na3VO4, 10 μm ATP, and 2 μg of recombinant MBP-CREB fusion protein as substrate (BIOSOURCE International, Camarillo, CA)). The reactions were terminated by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer and the products resolved by SDS-PAGE. CREB phosphorylated on Ser-133 was detected by Western blotting with anti-phospho-CREB (Ser-133) Ab as described above. In vitro nPKCδ kinase activity was measured as described above with the following modifications. Anti-nPKCδ (C-17) immune complexes obtained from B cell extracts were used to phosphorylate 1 μgof histone H1 substrate in 30 μl of kinase buffer supplemented with 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 15 min at 30 °C. The kinase reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled (5 min), and separated by SDS-PAGE. The phosphorylated histone H1 was detected by autoradiography. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclei were isolated by hypotonic lysis and extracted in a 450 mm NaCl buffer as described previously (20Amato S.F. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Chiles T.C. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 146-155PubMed Google Scholar). Binding reactions were carried out in a final volume of 15 μl and contained 1.5 μg of nuclear protein (extracted with 450 mm NaCl), 0.5 μg double-stranded poly(dI-dC), and 10,000 cpm of DNA labeled probe. DNA probes were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). After 20 min (23 °C), the reaction products were electrophoresed through a 5% polyacrylamide/TBE gel and subjected to autoradiography. For the analysis of nuclear extract binding to the bcl-2 promoter CRE site, the wild type and mutant probes corresponded to 5′-GAACCGTGTGACGTTACGCA-3′ and 5′-GAACCGTGTGAATTTACGCA-3′, respectively. B cell-derived nuclear extracts containing CREB or purified recombinant CREB bind the wild type bcl-2 promoter CRE site, whereas the mutant bcl-2 promoter CRE site fails to bind CREB/ATF proteins (25Wilson B.E. Mochon E. Boxer L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5546-5556Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Supershift analysis was performed by including in the nuclear extract binding reactions ∼1 μg of anti-CREB, anti-phospho-(Ser-133)CREB, or nonimmune Abs. BCR-induced Phosphorylation of CREB Is Dependent on c/nPKCs—We initially sought to demonstrate the requirement for a c/nPKC isoform(s) in BCR-induced CREB phosphorylation on Ser-133. The PKC isoforms expressed in mouse B cells and activated by BCR-induced diacylglycerol production include calcium-dependent cPKC-α,-βI/II, and -γ and calcium-independent nPKC -δ, -ϵ, and -η (33Mecklenbräuker I. Saijo K. Zheng N.-Y. Leitges M. Tarakhovsky A. Nature. 2002; 416: 860-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 35Mischak H. Kolch W. Goodnight J. Davidson W.F. Rapp U. Rose-John S.

Splenic B cells were pretreated for 18 h with 100 ng/ml PMA in order to deplete cells of c/nPKC isoforms and then stimulated with anti-Ig or PMA. As a control for the specificity of PMA, B cells were also pretreated for 18 h with 100 ng/ml of the inactive PMA analog, 4α-PMA. Treatment of B cells with PMA (18 h) led to a block in BCR-induced CREB phosphorylation (Fig. 1A, lanes pCREB, compare M with αIg, PMA o/n). Addition of fresh PMA to parallel B cell cultures failed to increase CREB phosphorylation (Fig. 1A, lanes pCREB, compare M with P, PMA o/n). The lack of CREB phosphorylation cannot be attributed to depletion of cellular CREB by prolonged PMA treatment (Fig. 1A, lanes CREB, PMA o/n). By contrast, CREB phosphorylation was induced in 4α-PMA-pretreated B cells subsequently stimulated with anti-Ig or PMA (Fig. 1A, lanes pCREB, 4αPMA o/n). To assess the efficacy of PMA as it pertains to PKC down-regulation, we found that the cellular levels of nPKCδ and nPKCϵ were depleted by PMA, but not 4α-PMA pretreatment (Fig 1A, lanes nPKCδ and nPKCϵ). Similar results were obtained for the cPKC-α, -β and -γ (data not shown). Effects of nPKCδ Inhibitors and Activators on BCR-induced CREB Phosphorylation in Splenic B Cells—To identify the PKC isoform(s) contributing to BCR-induced CREB phosphorylation, several cell-permeable inhibitors of PKCs were evaluated for their ability to inhibit CREB phosphorylation. Gö6976 is a specific inhibitor of cPKCs (ID50 = 2–6nm) and PKCμ (ID50 = 20 nm) (37Martiny-Baron G. Kazanietz M.G. Mischak H. Blumberg P.M. Kochs G. Hug H. Marme D. Schachtele C. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15771-15781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pretreatment of splenic B cells with Gö6976 ranging from 5 to 25 nm did not measurably inhibit anti-Ig-induced CREB phosphorylation under the conditions used (Fig. 1B, lanes pCREB). Similar results were obtained with the cPKC inhibitor Gö6850 (data not shown). The efficacy of Gö6976 was confirmed in that it blocked anti-Ig-induced IκBα phosphorylation on Ser-32/36, an event dependent, at least in part, on cPKCs (Fig. 1B, lanes pIκBα) (39Lallena M.J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Bren G. Paya C.V. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2180-2188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together with the data in Fig. 1A, these findings point to a possible role for nPKCs in linking the BCR to CREB activation. Of the known nPKC isoforms expressed in B lymphocytes, nPKCδ exhibits the highest level of expression and is phosphorylated on regulatory residues, Tyr-311 and Thr-505 in response to BCR cross-linking (33Mecklenbräuker I. Saijo K. Zheng N.-Y. Leitges M. Tarakhovsky A. Nature. 2002; 416: 860-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 40Barbazuk S.M. Gold M.R. Immunol. Lett. 1999; 69: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To determine whether nPKCδ activity is necessary for BCR-induced CREB phosphorylation, splenic B cells were preincubated with rottlerin, a specific inhibitor of nPKCδ (41Gschwendt M. Muller H.J. Kielbassa K. Zang R. Kittstein W. Rincke G. Marks F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). At concentrations ranging between 10 and 20 μm, rottlerin blocked BCR-induced CREB phosphorylation in primary splenic B cells isolated from either BALB/c or CBA/CaJ mice (Fig. 1C, lanes pCREB). As a control, we found that BCR-induced nPKCδ activity was inhibited by pretreatment of splenic B cells with 10 μm rottlerin (Fig. 1C, inset). These findings suggest that nPKCδ activity is required for BCR-induced CREB phosphorylation. To obtain further evidence for a role of nPKCδ in CREB phosphorylation, we evaluated whether the highly selective activator of nPKCδ, bistratene A (Bis A), was sufficient to promote CREB phosphorylation. Bis A is a cyclic polyether toxin isolated from Lissoclinum bistratum and has been shown to selectively activate nPKCδ in vivo at concentrations between 50 and 100 nm (42Watters D. Garrone B. Gobert G. Williams S. Gardiner R. Lavin M. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 229: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Treatment of splenic B cells with 50 nm Bis A led to a rapid and transient increase in CREB phosphorylation (Fig. 1D, lanes pCREB). Bis A did not alter the cellular levels of β-actin protein (Fig. 1D, lanes β-actin). Bis A also induced CREB phosphorylation in splenic B cells from CBA/CaJ mice (data not shown). Thus, BCR-induced CREB phosphorylation is blocked by the nPKCδ inhibitor, rottlerin, and can be induced by selective activation of nPKCδ in the absence of BCR cross-linking. Bryostatin 1 Selectively Protects nPKCδ from PMA Depletion Concomitant with BCR-induced CREB Phosphorylation—To corroborate the findings above, we evaluated the effects of bryostatin 1, a non-phorbol ester activator of PKCs, on anti-Ig-stimulated CREB phosphorylation. Numerous studies have shown that exposure of mammalian cells to bryostatin 1 at concentrations between 100 nm and 1 μm results in the selective protection of nPKCδ, but not other c/nPKC, from PMA-induced depletion when coapplied (43Szallasi Z.

The working hypothesis is that such regulation could inhibit collagen deposition by osteoblasts. We report that in phenotypically normal MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts, TNF-α decreases collagen deposition without decreasing collagen mRNA levels or procollagen protein synthesis. Analyses of the cell layers revealed that TNF-α diminished the levels of mature collagen cross-links, pyridinoline and deoxypyridinoline. Further analyses revealed that the mRNA expression for lysyl oxidase, the determining enzyme required for collagen cross-linking, is down-regulated by TNF-α in a concentration- and time-dependent manner by up to 50%. The decrease was accompanied by a significant reduction of lysyl oxidase protein levels and enzyme activity. By contrast, Northern and Western blotting studies revealed that procollagen C-proteinases bone morphogenic protein-1 and mammalians Tolloid and procollagen C-proteinase enhancer were expressed in MC3T3-E1 cells and not down-regulated. The data together demonstrate that TNF-α does not inhibit collagen synthesis but does inhibit the expression and activity of lysyl oxidase in osteoblasts, thereby contributing to perturbed collagen cross-linking and accumulation. These studies identify a novel mechanism in which proinflammatory cytokine modulation of an extracellular biosynthetic enzyme plays a determining role in the control of collagen accumulation by osteoblasts.

TNF-α levels are elevated in various bone disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis, and periodontitis (1Pacifici R. J. Bone Miner.

In bone tissue, TNF-α inhibits osteoblast function and increases osteoclastogenesis, thus favoring net matrix destruction (5Canalis E.

Reports indicate that TNF-α somehow inhibits collagen deposition while having little effect on collagen synthesis, although the mechanisms that contribute to this phenomenon have not been elucidated (6Centrella M.

Cell Biochem. 1996; 158: 81-89PubMed Google Scholar). Type I collagen is the major structural protein in the extracellular matrix of bone tissue. Normal collagen structure and the balance between production, deposition, and degradation of collagen are important in the development and maintenance of skeletal tissue (1Pacifici R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 1043-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Collagen biosynthesis is a multistep process that involves intracellular posttranslational modifications, assembly of procollagen chains, secretion, extracellular processing, and cross-linking to form a mature functional matrix (10Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 403-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar). The mechanisms that control collagen deposition in osteoblasts are not well understood but seem likely to include the regulation of extracellular collagen-biosynthetic enzymes and proteins (11Hong H. Pischon N. Santana R. Palamakumbura A. Babakhanlou Chase H. Gantz D. Guo Y. Uzel M. Ma D. Trackman P. J. Cell. Physiol. 2004; 200: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Moreover, TNF-α regulation of enzymes and proteins crucial for posttranslational extracellular collagen maturation such as procollagen C-proteinases and the cross-linking enzyme lysyl oxidase have not been studied directly to our knowledge. Tropocollagen molecules assemble into collagen fibrils and are subsequently stabilized as a result of oxidative deamination of ϵ-amino groups of peptidyllysine and hydroxylysine residues by lysyl oxidase, forming the aldehyde moieties. The resulting peptidyl-α-aminoadipic-δ-semialdehyde and peptidyl-δ-hydroxy-α-aminoadipic-δ-semialdehyde residues are highly reactive and form covalent cross-links that are critically required for the formation of functional mature and insoluble collagen (12Kagan H.

The cleavage of globular carboxyl-terminal procollagen I-III propeptides by procollagen C-proteinases results in a 1,000-fold decreased collagen solubility (10Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 403-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar). In the collagenous matrix procollagen, C-proteinases are only present in limited quantities. However, procollagen C-proteinase enhancer protein (PCPE), which stimulates procollagen C-proteinase activity against procollagen substrates (20Hojima Y. van der Rest M. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15996-16003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is an abundant glycoprotein in connective tissues (21Kessler E. Mould A.P. Hulmes D.J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

This study demonstrates that TNF-α down-regulates lysyl oxidase expression in phenotypically normal osteoblasts. TNF-α inhibited lysyl oxidase steady-state mRNA expression by up to 50%, and this was time- and concentration-dependent. The decrease in lysyl oxidase mRNA levels was accompanied by a significant reduction of lysyl oxidase protein and enzyme activity. Although collagen synthesis was not inhibited, less collagen accumulated in the extracellular matrix in the presence of TNF-α and the deposited collagen contained diminished levels of mature cross-links, pyridinolines (Pyd) and deoxypyridinolines (Dpd). By contrast, BMP-1, mTLD, and their biological enhancer, PCPE, were not regulated by this cytokine. These findings identify a novel mechanism in which down-regulation of an extracellular collagen biosynthetic enzyme by TNF-α contributes to the deposition of abnormal collagen more likely to be degraded. This mechanism could contribute to net bone resorption that occurs in vivo as a consequence of inflammation. Cell Layer Hydroxyproline and Collagen Cross-links—200,000 MC3T3-E1 cells were plated on 100-mm tissue cultures plates and grown until confluency. Cells then were grown in differentiation medium (α-MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 μg/ml ascorbate, and 10 mm β-glycerophosphate with or without 10 ng/ml or 100 ng/ml TNF-α for 12 days. Cell layers were hydrolyzed in 6 n HCl at 110 °C for 24 h in sealed glass ampules. Hydrolysates were vacuum-dried and then used to determine hydroxyproline levels by colorimetric assays (25Edwards C.A. O'Brien Jr., W.D. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1980; 104: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) and for mature type I collagen cross-links Pyd and Dpd using the Metra PYD enzyme immunoassay kit (Quidel, San Diego, CA). The cross-link assay is a competitive enzyme-linked immunoassay in which Pyd and Dpd in hydrolyzed cell extracts compete with Pyd coated on a microtiter plate for soluble monoclonal anti-pyridinium cross-link antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. Following a washing step, the substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate was added for 60 min. The reaction then was stopped by adding 1 n NaOH to each well, and the optical density was measured at 405 nm. The Pyd plus Dpd concentration in each sample was determined from a standard curve run on the same microtiter plate. Collagen Synthesis Assay—Subconfluent MC3T3-E1 cells were treated with 0, 10, or 100 ng/ml TNF-α for 24 h. Cells then were incubated for 2 h with serum- and proline-free α-MEM containing 10 μCi/ml [2,3-3H] proline in presence and absence of TNF-α. The cell layers were harvested in 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, on ice and homogenized (PowerGen 125, Fisher Scientific, Morris Plains, NJ). Radioactive protein was separated from unincorporated tritiated proline by precipitation with 5% trichloroacetic acid at 4 °C. Residual trichloroacetic acid then was removed by 3:1 ethanol/ether washes. The remaining pellet was air-dried and redissolved in 1 n NaOH at 37 °C for 5 min. 500 μl of incubation buffer (60 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 0.25 mm CaCl2, 1.25 mm N-ethylmaleimide) was added to each sample. 100 μl of the sample in the incubation buffer was mixed with 5 ml of scintillation fluid, and total incorporated tritiated proline was measured in a liquid scintillation spectrometer. 200 μl of the sample in the incubation buffer was incubated with 25 μg/ml purified bacterial collagenase (Worthington Biochem, Freehold, NJ) for 90 min at 37 °C under agitation (26Peterkowsky B. Diegelmann R. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 988-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (1174) Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped with 10% trichloroacetic acid, 0.5% tannic acid on ice and then centrifuged at 400 × g for 5 min. The supernatant, which contained the collagen-derived peptides, was transferred to counting vials with 5 ml of scintillation fluid, and the radioactivity was measured as above. Data for collagen synthesis were normalized to the DNA content. Regulation Studies—MC3T3-E1 cells were maintained in α-MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% nonessential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were cultivated for no more than three passages from one set of frozen cell stocks. For experiments, 350,000 cells were plated on a 100-mm tissue culture dish and grown to 70% confluence at 37 °C in a fully humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Medium then was changed to serum-free containing 0.1% BSA, 50 μg/ml ascorbate, and 10 mm β-glycerophosphate. After 24 h, cells were then re-fed with the same serum-free medium with or without TNF-α as indicated. TNF-α concentrations up to 100 ng/ml were not cytotoxic to MC3T3-E1 cells as determined by a trypan blue exclusion assay for cell viability (27DeRenzi F.A. Schechtman A. Stain Technol. 1973; 48: 135-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and crystal violet analyses for cell layer DNA content (28Kostenuik P.J. Halloran B.P. Morey-Holton E.R. Bikle D.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: E1133-E1139PubMed Google Scholar). RNA Isolation and Northern Analysis—Total RNA was extracted by RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 10 μg of denatured RNA/lane was electrophoresed on 1% agarose/formaldehyde gels and transferred to GeneScreen™ nylon membranes. cDNA probes were radiolabeled with 3000 Ci/mmol [α-32P]dCTP by random priming (29Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16651) Google Scholar). Membranes were prehybridized for 30 min and then hybridized (ExpressHyb™, Clontech) for 1 h at 68 °C with probes for mouse lysyl oxidase (30Kenyon K. Contente S. Trackman P.C. Tang J. Kagan H.M. Friedman R.F. Science. 1991; 253: 802Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), BMP-1/mTLD (31Kessler E. Takahara K. Biniaminov L. Brusel M. Greenspan D.S. Science. 1996; 271: 360-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), and PCPE (32Scott I.C. Clark T.G. Takahara K. Hoffman G.G. Greenspan D.S. Genomics. 1999; 55: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). For normalization, blots were stripped and rehybridized with a radiolabeled 18 S rRNA probe (33Hillis D. Dixon T. Q. Rev. Biol. 1991; 66: 411-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (2066) Google Scholar). Blots were washed in 2× SSC, 0.05% SDS for 30–40 min at room temperature and then twice in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 40 min at 50 °C. Washed membranes then were exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film with intensifying screens at –80 °C. Autoradiograms were quantitated by the scanning densitometry of autoradiograms exposed for varying lengths of time. Western Blot Analysis—Subconfluent cells were treated with or without TNF-α in serum-free α-MEM cell culture medium for 24 h. After cells were re-fed with fresh medium plus or minus TNF-α, the cell layers were harvested after 24 h, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and scraped in 500 μl of sample buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, 4% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol). Media samples were collected (20 ml) and concentrated to 1 ml (10 kDa, Centricon, Amicon, Bedford, MA) and suspended in 500 μl of sample buffer. Protein concentration in the samples was measured using a fluorometric protein assay (Nano Orange, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). 2.5 μg of protein of the media and 25 μg of protein of the cell lysates were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by electroblotting in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 10% methanol. Blots were blocked in BlockHen II (Aves Lab Inc., Tigard, OR) for 1 h and incubated with the primary antibody in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20 for 2 h. After washing three times with phosphate-buffered saline, blots were incubated for 1 h with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody. Western Blue substrate (Promega, Madison, WI) was applied for detection. A BMP-1-specific antibody was raised in rabbit against a synthetic peptide (GRPHQLKFRVQKRNRTPQC) corresponding to the unique carboxyl-terminal sequence of human BMP-1. The cysteine residue was added to allow coupling to ovalbumin using the Imject maleimide-activated immunogen kit (Pierce). An IgG fraction was prepared from the immune serum by ammonium sulfate precipitation and used for detection of BMP-1. PCPE antibody was described previously (34Ogata I. Auster A.S. Matsui A. Greenwel P. Geerts A. D'Amico T. Fujiwara K. Kessler E. Rojkind M. Hepatology. 1997; 26: 611-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Lysyl oxidase antibody was described previously (35Trackman P.C. Pratt A.M. Wolanski A. Tang S.-S. Offner G.D. Troxler R.F. Kagan H.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4863-4870Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Recombinant human TNF-α was obtained from PeproTech Inc. (Rocky Hill, NJ). α-MEM, Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, fetal bovine serum, nonessential amino acids, trypsin-EDTA solution, penicillin, streptomycin, BSA fraction V, ascorbic acid, and β-glycerophosphate were purchased from Sigma. Culture plates and multiwell culture dishes were from Costar (Cambridge, MA). Murine calvarial osteoblast MC3TC-E1 subclone 14 (CRL-2594) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Lysyl Oxidase Activity Assay—200,000 cells were plated on a 100-mm tissue culture dish and grown to 80% visual confluence. Phenol red-free and serum-free α-MEM containing 0.1% BSA, 50 μg/ml ascorbate, and 10 mm β-glycerophosphate was added for 24 h. Cells then were re-fed with fresh medium plus or minus TNF-α for 24 h. Lysyl oxidase enzyme activity was measured in the conditioned medium by a fluorometric assay (36Palamakumbura A. Trackman P. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 300: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In this assay, lysyl oxidase oxidatively deaminates alkyl monoamines generating hydrogen peroxide. Horseradish peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of N-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine (Amplex Red) by hydrogen peroxide produces fluorescent resorufin, which was measured using a Hitachi F-2000 fluorescence spectrometer with excitation and emission wavelengths at 563 and 587 nm, respectively. Parallel assays were prepared with 500 μm β-aminoproprionitrile fumarate to completely inhibit the activity of lysyl oxidase, and the difference in emission intensity was recorded. The amount of hydrogen peroxide produced by the action of lysyl oxidase was determined by comparing fluorescence changes to a standard plot relating fluorescence change to nanomoles of hydrogen peroxide. A fluorometric assay was performed to determine DNA content in the cells/100-mm tissue culture plate (37Vytasek R. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 120: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Osteoblasts were scraped in 0.01% Triton-X, and cell lysates then were homogenized and hydrolyzed with 1 m perchloric acid at 70 °C for 20 min to liberate deoxyribose. After the reaction with m-diaminobenzoic acid, the amount of liberated deoxyribose was measured by fluorescence spectrophotometer at excitation and emission wavelengths of 405 and 520 nm, respectively. TNF-α Inhibits Collagen Accumulation—Osteoblasts deposit abundant amounts of collagen as they differentiate in culture to ultimately form a bone-like extracellular matrix. Previous data reveal that maximum collagen accumulation in the cell layer of MC3T3-E1 cells occurs between days 12 and 15 (11Hong H. Pischon N. Santana R. Palamakumbura A. Babakhanlou Chase H. Gantz D. Guo Y. Uzel M. Ma D. Trackman P. J. Cell. Physiol. 2004; 200: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To understand the regulation of extracellular collagen-biosynthetic enzymes by TNF-α, we first investigated how TNF-α controls collagen deposition in MC3T3-E1 cells under these culture conditions. Therefore, MC3T3-E1 cells were cultured in ascorbate- and β-glycerophosphate-supplemented medium for 12 days in the presence and absence of 10 and 100 ng/ml TNF-α. Hydroxyproline levels as an index of collagen deposition then were measured in hydrolyzed total cell layers. The results in Fig. 1A show that in the presence of TNF-α cell layer collagen accumulation was inhibited and was dose-dependent and significant (p < 0.01). Cell layer hydroxyproline levels in cultures treated with 100 ng/ml TNF-α were reduced to 34% of untreated control cultures (Fig. 1A). TNF-α Does Not Alter Collagen Synthesis—Since hydroxyproline analysis indicated that TNF-α inhibits collagen accumulation, we further studied the effects of TNF-α on new collagen synthesis in MC3T3-E1 cells. MC3T3-E1 cells were treated for 24 h with or without TNF-α and then pulsed with [2,3-3H]proline for 2 h. A previous study (38Beldekas J. Smith B. Gerstenfeld L. Sonenshein G. Franzblau C. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 2162-2167Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) indicates that labeling periods of 1–2 h are optimal for measuring the synthesis of newly formed procollagen. Thus, collagen synthesis was determined in the cell layer by measuring the amount of tritiated proline incorporated into collagenase-sensitive protein. As shown in Fig. 1B, the exposure of MC3T3-E1 cells to TNF-α did not affect collagen synthesis significantly, although a trend toward decreased collagen synthesis at 100 ng/ml TNF-α was observed that was not significant statistically (p = 0.515). Normalization to DNA levels/plate did not change these findings, because DNA levels were the same in all of the treatment groups: 564.63 ± 71.22 μg/plate (mean ± S.D.). TNF-α Does Not Alter Steady-state Collagen mRNA Levels— We next determined the effects of 0, 10, and 100 ng/ml TNF-α treatment of MC3T3-E1 cells for 24 h on steady-state α1-type I collagen mRNA levels in MC3T3-E1 cells. Total RNA was isolated and subjected to Northern blot analyses. Two of the three experiments showed no regulation of α1-type I collagen steady-state mRNA levels by TNF-α (Fig. 1C). However, one experiment revealed a down-regulation of 15% at TNF-α concentrations of 100 ng/ml. These data show that TNF-α does not decrease steady-state collagen, type I mRNA expression significantly in MC3T3-E1 cell cultures, although a tendency toward decreased mRNA levels was observed at 100 ng/ml. TNF-α Decreases Total Mature Cross-link Formation—The data indicate that TNF-α down-regulates collagen accumulation but hardly affects collagen synthesis and steady-state collagen type I mRNA levels. This finding strongly suggests that TNF-α primarily controls extracellular collagen modifications rather than procollagen biosynthesis. Therefore, we wished to further examine the collagenous matrix deposited under the influence of TNF-α to investigate whether cross-linking might be inhibited. MC3T3-E1 cells were cultured in ascorbate- and β-glycerophosphate-supplemented cell culture medium for 12 days in the presence and absence of 10 and 100 ng/ml TNF-α. The amount of mature cross-links Pyd and Dpd then was assessed in the total cell layer by enzyme immunoassay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” TNF-α inhibited collagen cross-link levels in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1D). These data indicate that TNF-α reduced mature collagen cross-links to levels of 25% found in control cultures. This is a greater reduction compared with that found for TNF-α-dependent reduction of total collagen deposition as determined above in Fig. 1A. This finding points to the possibility that lysyl oxidase-dependent cross-linking could be a primary target of TNF-α. TNF-α Reduces Lysyl Oxidase Steady-state mRNA Levels, Protein Expression, and Enzyme Activity in MC3T3-E1 Cells—As TNF-α decreases mature collagen cross-link levels, we wished to assess whether TNF-α regulates lysyl oxidase. MC3T3-E1 cells were treated in serum-free α-MEM supplemented with 0.1% BSA in the absence or presence of TNF-α for varying periods of time. Total RNA was isolated and subjected to Northern blot analyses. Results presented in Fig. 2, A and B, revealed that treatment of osteoblasts with TNF-α for 24 h inhibits steady-state lysyl oxidase mRNA levels and is dose-dependent. Diminished lysyl oxidase mRNA levels were observed at 10 and 100 ng/ml TNF-α compared with the untreated control (Fig. 2B). In multiple experiments, down-regulation of lysyl oxidase mRNA levels by TNF-α ranged between 20 and 50% compared with untreated control cultures. Time-dependent regulation of steady-state lysyl oxidase mRNA levels was tested as well. The data indicate that 10 ng/ml TNF-α down-regulated lysyl oxidase mRNA levels slowly and was first observed after 16 h and reached its maximum effect by 24 h of treatment (Fig. 3, A and B). The extended treatment of cells for up to 48 h caused no further down-regulation of lysyl oxidase (data not shown).Fig. 3Time-dependent inhibition of lysyl oxidase steady-state mRNA levels by TNF-α in MC3T3-E1 cells. Cells were treated in serum-free α-MEM (0.1% BSA) with or without 10 ng/ml TNF-α for 8, 16, and 24 h. In A, 10 μg of total RNA was subjected to Northern blot analyses and hybridized with probes for lysyl oxidase, mTLD/BMP-1, PCPE, and 18 S rRNA. Results shown are from one of three representative experiments with the same results obtained. In B, quantitation of lysyl oxidase levels normalized to 18 S rRNA in the percentage of control are shown. Values are the mean ± S.D. obtained from three scanning densitometry determinations of films from the blot shown in panel A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We next examined whether lysyl oxidase protein levels are regulated by TNF-α. Cells were treated with serum-free medium with or without TNF-α for 24 h and then re-fed with or without TNF-α for another 24 h. Media samples then were subjected to Western blot analysis with an antibody against lysyl oxidase. Fig. 4 shows that 100 ng/ml TNF-α treatment of cells decreased the amount of the mature 32-kDa lysyl oxidase found in conditioned medium. The data in Fig. 5 present the effect of TNF-α on lysyl oxidase enzyme activity. Lysyl oxidase enzyme activity was decreased significantly and was dose-dependent.Fig. 5TNF-α inhibits lysyl oxidase enzyme activity in MC3T3-E1 cells. Lysyl oxidase enzyme activity was measured in the media samples from cells grown in serum- and phenol-free media in the presence of TNF-α for 24 h.

https://openalex.org/W2065762983,"A tobacco calcium/calmodulin-binding protein kinase (NtCBK1) was isolated and identified. The predicted NtCBK1 protein has 599 amino acids, an N-terminal kinase domain, and shares high homology with other calmodulin (CaM)-related kinases. Whereas NtCBK1 phosphorylates itself and substrates such as histone IIIS and syntide-2 in the absence of CaM, its kinase activity can be stimulated by tobacco CaMs. However, unlike another tobacco protein kinase designated NtCBK2, NtCBK1 was not differentially regulated by the different CaM isoforms tested. The CaM-binding domain of NtCBK1 was located between amino acids 436 and 455, and this domain was shown to be necessary for CaM modulation of kinase activity. RNA in situ hybridization showed that NtCBK1 was highly regulated in the transition to flowering. Whereas NtCBK1 mRNA was accumulated in the shoot apical meristem during vegetative growth, its expression was dramatically decreased in the shoot apical meristem after floral determination, and in young flower primordia. The expression of NtCBK1 was up-regulated to high levels in floral organ primordia. Fluctuations in NtCBK1 expression were verified by analysis of tobacco plants expressing green fluorescent protein under the control of the NtCBK1 promoter, suggesting a role of NtCBK1 in the transition to flowering. This conclusion was confirmed by overexpressing NtCBK1 in transgenic tobacco plants, where maintenance of high levels of NtCBK1 in the shoot apical meristem delayed the switch to flowering and extended the vegetative phase of growth. Further work indicated that overexpression of NtCBK1 in transgenic tobacco did not affect the expression of NFL, a tobacco homologue of the LFY gene that controls meristem initiation and floral structure in tobacco. In addition, the promotion of tobacco flowering time by DNA demethylation cannot be blocked by the overexpression of NtCBK1.

Calcium (Ca2+) plays important roles as a second messenger in plant developmental and physiological processes via a group of Ca2+ target proteins, including CaM and Ca2+-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs), 1The abbreviations used are: CDPK, Ca2+-dependent protein kinase; CaMK, calcium/CaM-dependent protein kinase; CBK, CaM-binding protein kinase; CCaMK, chimeric CaM-dependent protein kinase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; SAM, shoot apical meristem. 1The abbreviations used are: CDPK, Ca2+-dependent protein kinase; CaMK, calcium/CaM-dependent protein kinase; CBK, CaM-binding protein kinase; CCaMK, chimeric CaM-dependent protein kinase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; SAM, shoot apical meristem. two well known Ca2+-binding proteins (1Chin D. Means A.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 322-328Google Scholar, 2Harmon A.C. Gribskov M. Harper J.F. Trends Plant Sci. 2000; 5: 154-159Google Scholar). CaM is ubiquitously expressed and has no enzymatic activity of its own. The activities and expression patterns of a variety of CaM-binding proteins including calcium/CaM-dependent protein kinases (CaMKs) are key players in Ca2+/CaM-mediated signaling pathways in plants (3Braun A.P. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 417-445Google Scholar, 4Snedden W.A. Fromm H. New Phytol. 2001; 151: 35-66Google Scholar, 5Zhang L. Lu Y.-T. Trends Plant Sci. 2003; 8: 123-127Google Scholar). In contrast to animal systems, there are only a few reports on CaM-binding protein kinases (CBKs) in plants. To date, CBKs have been isolated from apple (CB1, a homolog of mammalian CaMK II, 6), maize (MCKs, 7, 8), rice (OsCBK, 9), and chimeric CaM-dependent protein kinases (CCaMKs) from lily, tobacco, and maize (10Takezawa D. Ramachndiran S. Paranjape V. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8126-8132Google Scholar, 11Ramachandiran S. Takezawa D. Wang W. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 984-990Google Scholar, 12Liu Z. Xia M. Poovaiah B.W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 38: 889-897Google Scholar). Whereas all of these CBKs have been shown to have CaM binding activity, only tobacco NtCBK2, rice OsCBK2, and CCaMKs have been shown experimentally to possess kinase activity. CCaMKs have been shown to have a visinin-like domain and three EF-hand motifs that are necessary for Ca2+-dependent autophosphorylation and for maximal activation (10Takezawa D. Ramachndiran S. Paranjape V. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8126-8132Google Scholar, 11Ramachandiran S. Takezawa D. Wang W. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 984-990Google Scholar, 12Liu Z. Xia M. Poovaiah B.W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 38: 889-897Google Scholar). The enzymatic activity of OsCBK, on the other hand, was found to be independent of either calcium or CaM (9Zhang L. Liu B.F. Liang S.P. Jones R.L. Lu Y.-T. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 145-157Google Scholar). Considerable attention has recently been paid to the analyses of the expression profiles of plant CBKs (5Zhang L. Lu Y.-T. Trends Plant Sci. 2003; 8: 123-127Google Scholar, 13Reddy V.S. Ali G.S. Reddy A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9840-9852Google Scholar). These analyses have indicated that CCaMKs, MCKs, and OsCBK are regulated temporally and spatially during various stages of plant development (8Wang L. Liang S.P. Lu Y.-T. Planta. 2001; 213: 556-564Google Scholar, 9Zhang L. Liu B.F. Liang S.P. Jones R.L. Lu Y.-T. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 145-157Google Scholar, 12Liu Z. Xia M. Poovaiah B.W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 38: 889-897Google Scholar, 14Poovaiah B.W. Xia M. Liu Z. Wang W. Yang T. Sathyanarayanan P.V. Franceschi V.R. Planta. 1999; 209: 161-171Google Scholar), as well as by environmental triggers such as light. For example, red light down-regulates the expression of maize ZmCCaMK (15Pandey S. Sopory S.K. J. Exp. Bot. 2001; 52: 691-700Google Scholar). It has also been reported that overexpression of maize MCK1 in tobacco leads to the abortion of flower primordia on the main shoot axis, implying a role for MCK1 in flower development (16Liang S. Wang X.-F. Lu Y.-T. Sci. Chin. 2001; 44: 506-512Google Scholar). Because little information is available about the roles of CBKs, their biological functions remain to be elucidated. The transition from vegetative to reproductive growth is a key event in the life cycle of plants. The transition has been intensively studied (17Mouradov A. Cremer F. Coupland G. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: S111-S130Google Scholar), and the regulatory networks controlling the process are perhaps best understood in Arabidopsis (18Levy Y.Y. Dean C. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1973-1989Google Scholar, 19Yanovsky M.J. Kay S.A. Nat. Rev. 2003; 4: 265-275Google Scholar). Environmental factors, including photoperiod (day length), light quality (spectral composition), light quantity (photon flux density), cold temperature (vernalization), and nutrient and water availability play important roles in flowering time control in Arabidopsis (20Simpson G.G. Dean C. Science. 2002; 296: 285-289Google Scholar). Not all plants use the same environmental triggers to bring about a change from vegetative to reproductive growth. For example, tobacco shows important differences in its flowering response when compared with Arabidopsis. Tobacco flowers in response to internal cues, such as plant size or number of vegetative nodes (18Levy Y.Y. Dean C. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1973-1989Google Scholar), and the duration of the vegetative phase is independent of day length, and regulated by as yet unidentified developmental signals (21McDaniel C.N. J. Exp. Bot. 1996; 47: 465-475Google Scholar, 22McDaniel C.N. Sangrey K.A. Singer S.R. Am. J. Bot. 1989; 76: 403-408Google Scholar). An example of the type of developmental signal that can regulate flowering time comes from overexpression of the Antirrhinum gene CENTRORADIALIS in tobacco, which brings about an extension of the vegetative growth phase and delays the switch to flowering (23Amaya I. Ratcliffe O.J. Bradley D.J. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1405-1417Google Scholar). Further investigations on exactly which events mark the transition to flowering and their regulation is needed (24Hempel F.D. Feldman L.J. Plant J. 1995; 8: 725-731Google Scholar). Protein kinases have been shown to be involved in many cellular processes, including regulation of metabolism, transcription, cell cycle progression, cytoskeletal rearrangement and cell movement, apoptosis, differentiation, and responses to a variety of stimuli (25Schenk P.W. Snaar-Jagalska B.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1449: 1-24Google Scholar, 26Manning G. Whyte D.B. Martinez R. Hunter T. Sudarsanam S. Science. 2002; 298: 1912-1934Google Scholar). Several protein kinases, such as protein kinase CK2 and never in mitosis A (NIMA)-like kinase, have been reported to be involved in the regulation of flowering plants. Protein kinase CK2, interacting with circadian clock-associated 1, has been shown to play an important role in the regulation of the circadian clock in Arabidopsis. Plants overexpressing CKB3, a regulatory subunit of CK2, increases CK2 activity, resulting in reduced flowering time (27Sugano S. Andronis C. Ong M.S. Green R.M. Tobin E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12362-12366Google Scholar, 28Sugano S. Andronis C. Ong M.S. Green R.M. Wang Z.Y. Tobin E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11020-11025Google Scholar). NIMA-like kinase, on the other hand, interacts with 14-3-3 proteins and SELF-PRUNING, a member of a family of modulator proteins, to regulate tomato shoot architecture and flowering (29Pnueli L. Gutfinger T. Hareven D. Ben-Naim O. Ron N. Adir N. Lifschitz E. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 2687-2702Google Scholar). Here we present evidence for a role of the tobacco Ca2+/CaM-binding protein kinase NtCBK1 in flowering. NtCBK1 is identified as a CBK based on molecular and biochemical evidence. NtCBK1 binds CaM in a Ca2+-dependent manner and phosphorylates both itself and substrates. Whereas kinase activity assays indicate that this kinase has enzymatic activity in the absence of CaM, this activity can be stimulated up to 5-fold by CaM. The expression of NtCBK1 in the shoot apical meristem is highly regulated during the transition to flowering as shown by both RNA in situ hybridization and transgenic analyses with GFP driven by the NtCBK1 promoter. Transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing NtCBK1 display a late-flowering phenotype, suggesting that NtCBK1 could function as a negative regulator of flowering. Further work indicated that overexpression of NtCBK1 did not affect flowering by influencing either the expression of NFL, a tobacco homologue of LFY that controls meristem initiation and floral structure, or by blocking demethylation, a treatment that promotes flowering in tobacco. Tobacco CDNA Library Screening—mRNAs were isolated from tobacco (Nicotiana tabaccum cv. W38) and used for cDNA library construction with a ZAP-cDNA synthesis kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). The cDNA library was screened with plasmid p550 containing a maize cDNA encoding MCK1 (7Lu Y.T. Hidaka H. Feldman L.J. Planta. 1996; 199: 18-24Google Scholar). Positive recombinant phages for NtCBK1 were isolated and excised into recombinant pBluescript SK(–) in vivo and candidate plasmids were sequenced. Construction of NtCBK1 and Truncated NtCBK1—To define the CaM-binding domain, several truncated constructs were made with the pFastHTb expression vector (Fig. 2A). The cDNAs for the full open reading frame (NtCBK1) and three truncated forms (T1–455, T1–416, and T436–599) of NtCBK1 were amplified with 4 pairs of primers as follows: 5′ primer CGGGATCCATGGGGCACTGCTGCAGTAAGG and 3′ primer CGGGATCCTTATCGATGATGTCTTGTGCTTGAACC for NtCBK1; 5′ primer CGGGATCCATGGGGCACTGCTGCAGTAAGG and 3′ primer CGGGATCCTTAGAGGTAGATTAACTCTTC for T1–455; 5′ primer CGGGATCCATGGGGCACTGCTGCAGTAGG and 3′ primer CGGGATCCTTATAAAACAGGATTTTCCGTCC for T1–416; 5′ primer CGGGATCCAAACGTGCAGCATTGAAGGCTC and 3′ primer CGGGATCCTTATCGATGATGTCTTGTGCTTGAACC for T436–599. Whereas T1–455 contains the N terminus of NtCBK1, including the kinase catalytic domain, and a tentative CaM-binding domain, T1–416 has the same N-terminal amino acid sequence as T1–455, but lacks the tentative CaM-binding domain. The third truncated form, T436–599, contains the C terminus of NtCBK1 and the tentative CaM-binding domain. PCR products were digested with BamHI and subsequently cloned into the BamHI site of plasmid pFastHTb. After sequencing confirmation, recombinant plasmids were transformed into DH10Bac-competent cells containing the bacmid with a mini-att Tn7 target site and helper plasmid. The mini-Tn7 element on the pFastHTb donor plasmid can transpose to the mini-att Tn7 element on the bacmid in the presence of transposition proteins provided by the helper plasmid. Clones containing recombinant bacmid were identified based on the disruption of the lacZ gene. The Sf9 cells were maintained as monolayers at 27 °C supplemented with Grace's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and transfected by the recombinant bacmid with Cellfectin reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Recombinant virus was harvested after 72 h and identified by PCR with the primers described above. Purification of NtCBK1 Proteins—Insect Sf9 cells were infected with the recombinant virus for 72 h and harvested at room temperature. Cells were washed once with Grace's medium, resuspended in 5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride), sonicated for 30 s, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was applied to a Ni-NTA resin column pre-equilibrated with buffer A (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, 300 mm KCl, 10% glycerol). After extensive washing with buffer A followed by buffer A containing 25 mm imidazole, NtCBK1 was eluted with buffer A containing 200 mm imidazole. The eluted NtCBK1 was dialyzed in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, supplemented with 0.5 mm CaCl2 for about 6 h, and loaded on a CaM-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) column pre-equilibrated with buffer B (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm CaCl2). After washing with buffer B plus 200 mm NaCl, elution of NtCBK1 was with buffer C (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EGTA). After dialysis in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, for 6 h, purified NtCBK1 was either used immediately or stored at –80 °C prior to SDS-PAGE or enzymatic analyses. Protein concentration was determined by quantification of tryptophan in NtCBK1 (30Aitken A. Learmonth M. Walker J.M. Protein Protocols Handbook. 2nd Ed. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2002: 41-44Google Scholar). All procedures were performed at 4 °C unless stated otherwise. Preparation of 35S-Labeled and Biotinylated CaM—Tobacco calmodulin (NtCaM1/3/13) cDNAs cloned into the pET15 expression vectors (a gift from Dr. Y. Ohashi, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences) (31Yamakawa H. Mitsuhara I. Ito N. Seo S. Kamada H. Ohashi Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3916-3929Google Scholar) were used to prepare 35S-labeled CaM as described previously (32Fromm H. Chua N.-H. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 10: 199-206Google Scholar, 33Lu Y.T. Harrington H.M. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1994; 32: 413-422Google Scholar). Bovine CaM was biotinylated as described by Billingsley et al. (34Billingsley M.L. Pennypacker K.R. Hoover C.G. Brigati D.J. Kincaid R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7585-7589Google Scholar). Briefly, bovine CaM was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The bovine CaM was supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2 and incubated with d-biotinoyl-ϵ-amidocaproic acid-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Sigma) dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide at a final concentration of 1 mm. The incubation was performed for 2 h at 4 °C with constant stirring. The biotinylated CaM was further dialyzed in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 48 h at 4 °C, measured with bovine serum albumin as standard (35Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) and stored in 20% glycerol at –20 °C. CaM Binding Assay—NtCBK1 and its truncated forms were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. For biotinylated CaM binding assays, the membrane was blocked in 2% bovine serum albumin/Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 50 mm MgCl2, plus 0.5 mm CaCl2 or 2 mm EGTA) and washed three times with Tris-buffered saline for 15 min each. After incubation in Tris-buffered saline containing biotinylated CaM for 3 h at room temperature and then washing with Tris-buffered saline, the membrane was treated with avidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Bio-Rad) dissolved in Tris-buffered saline for 1 h. Protein bound to biotinylated CaM was visualized by color development with 4-chloro-1-naphthol and H2O2. Assay of NtCBK1 CaM Binding Affinity—CaM binding affinity was assayed as described (9Zhang L. Liu B.F. Liang S.P. Jones R.L. Lu Y.-T. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 145-157Google Scholar, 10Takezawa D. Ramachndiran S. Paranjape V. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8126-8132Google Scholar). Briefly, purified NtCBK1 protein (4 pmol) separated by SDS-PAGE was electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose filters and incubated with different concentrations of 35S-labeled CaM (0.5 × 106 cpm/μg) in 1 mm CaCl2 overnight. After washing with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm CaCl2, the radioactivities of the bound CaM on each filter, and free CaM in the incubation buffer collected before washing, were measured by liquid scintillation counting (Beckman LS 6500). Average background counts were subtracted from the counts in NtCBK1 protein samples when calculating the specific binding. The dissociation constant Kd was calculated by using SPSS EnzymeKinetics software (SPSS Science, Inc.). The data points are expressed as means of the results from three independent assays in duplicate. Autophosphorylation of NtCBK1—Autophosphorylation was carried out in a 100-μl reaction mixture containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 100 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (5000 Ci/mmol) plus 0.5 mm CaCl2 or 0.5 mm CaCl2, 1 μm CaM at 30 °C. For time course assays, 1 μg of NtCBK1 was used in a 100-μl reaction mixture. Aliquots for the zero time point were taken immediately after the addition of NtCBK1 and the reactions were terminated by adding ⅕ volume of 5× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. All aliquots were separated by SDS-PAGE with a 10% separating gel. After staining with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue, gels were vacuum-dried and exposed to x-ray film at –80 °C. The amount of phosphate transferred to the enzyme was determined by counting the radioactivities of the excised NtCBK1 bands in a liquid scintillation counter. Experiments were repeated three times in duplicate. Substrate Phosphorylation Assay—Substrate phosphorylation assays were performed in a 100-μl reaction mixture containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 100 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (5000 Ci/mmol), 100 μm histone IIIS, or 100 μm syntide-2 plus 0.5 mm CaCl2 or 0.5 mm CaCl2,1 μm CaM with 1 μg of NtCBK1 at 30 °C. For time course assays with histone IIIS as substrate, aliquots for the zero time point were taken immediately after the addition of NtCBK1 and the reaction was terminated by adding ⅕ volume of 5× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Aliquots were separated and counted as described above. The experiments were repeated three times in duplicate. For time course assays with syntide-2 as substrate, the experiments with two parallel reactions for different treatments were repeated three times. Aliquots for the zero time point were taken immediately after the addition of NtCBK1 to initiate the reaction and the reaction was terminated by adding ⅕ volume of 5× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Aliquots from one reaction were separated by SDS-PAGE with a 10% separating gel. The amount of phosphates transferred to the kinase was determined by counting the radioactivities of the excised NtCBK1 bands in a liquid scintillation counter. Aliquots from another reaction were applied to P81 phosphocellulose filters (2 × 2 cm squares, Whatman) for total 32P incorporation of the kinase and syntide-2. Filters were washed four times for 10 min each in 75 mm phosphoric acid, and rinsed in 100% ethanol and then air-dried. 32P incorporation was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The amount of phosphates transferred to substrate syntide-2 was determined by subtracting 32P incorporation of NtCBK1 from total 32P incorporation of NtCBK1 plus syntide-2. Activation Assay of NtCBK1 by NtCaM Isoforms—The reaction for NtCBK1 substrate phosphorylation was performed as described above. Aliquots (10 μl) were removed and applied to P81 phosphocellulose filters (2 × 2 cm squares, Whatman). Filters were washed four times for 10 min each in 75 mm phosphoric acid and rinsed in 100% ethanol and air-dried. 32P incorporation was determined by liquid scintillation counting (Beckman LS 6500). The experiments were repeated three times in duplicate. Phosphoamino Acid Assays—Both NtCBK1 and autophosphorylated NtCBK1 were hydrolyzed in 6 m HCl for 12 h at 110 °C, dried, and dissolved in 20 μl of 10 mm borate buffer, pH 10.0. The hydrolyzed product was mixed with 20 μl of 1 mm fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC, dissolved in acetone containing 0.05% pyridine, Sigma) and incubated in the dark for 12 h at room temperature. To prepare FITC-tagged standard amino acids and phosphoamino acids, 2 μl of standard solution containing each amino acid and phosphoamino acid (0.5 mm each) was mixed with 46 μl of 1 mm FITC, 100 μl of 20 mm borate buffer, pH 10.0, and 52 μl of H2O. The mixture was incubated in the dark for 12 h at room temperature. FITC-tagged amino acids were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis as described (36Liu B.-F. Zhang L. Lu Y.-T. J. Chromatogr. Sect. A. 2001; 918: 401-409Google Scholar). Data were collected on a computer with Spot Advanced software, and processed further with Scion Image and Origin software packages. RNA in Situ Hybridization and Detection—Tissues of tobacco were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, dehydrated in an ethanol series, cleared with xylene, and embedded in paraffin as described by Drews (37Drews G.N. Fixation and Embedding for in Situ Hybridization in Arabidopsis Molecular Genetics Course. Cold Spring Harbor Press, New York1995Google Scholar). Paraffin-embedded tissues were cut into 10-μm sections, which were attached to glass microscope slides coated with polylysine hydrobromide. Digoxigenin-labeled antisense and sense RNA probes for NtCBK1 were used for in situ hybridization analyses with paraffin-embedded tissue sections. The experiments were performed as described previously (8Wang L. Liang S.P. Lu Y.-T. Planta. 2001; 213: 556-564Google Scholar). Cloning of NtCBK1 Promoter—The NtCBK1 promoter region was isolated with an in vitro PCR cloning kit (TaKaRa Biotechnology, Shiga, Japan). Ten micrograms of tobacco genomic DNA was digested with the HindIII restriction enzyme, ligated with the HindIII cassette, and amplified by PCR according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR products were cloned into the pBI101-GFP vector, and the resulting plasmid was named pNtCBK1:GFP. Genetic Transformation and Flowering Time Examination—The NtCBK1 cDNA was obtained by PCR with primers: 5′ primer CGGATCCTGAAGTGGACTTTGACTGGCCG, and 3′ primer CGGATCCTTATCGATGATGTCTTGTGCTTGAAC, using pNtCBK1 as template and cloned into pBluescript SK(–). The BamHI-digested DNA fragment was then cloned into the BamHI site of pBIm that was made by adding three restriction digestion sites and deleting the GUS sequence of pBI121 and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Then, both the construct and pBI121 were transferred into Agrobacterium tumifaciens strain LBA4404 and introduced into tobacco. For NtCBK1 RNAi constructs, the coding sequences of either NtCBK1 or NtCBK2 were amplified by PCR and double inserted into BamHI or Xho/SacI sites with different orientations of pBIi that was made by placing the fourth intron of Arabidopsis tubby-like protein into the BamHI/XhoI site of pBIm. Regenerated kanamycin-resistant transgenic plants were transferred to soil and grown in the greenhouse. When the terminal flower was formed, all of the nodes on the primary shoot below the terminal flower were counted. For the transgenic plants that never flowered, the number of nodes per shoot was recorded by counting the number of leaves on the primary shoot from the last leaf (1 cm long) produced to the most basal leaf. Flowering time (days to flowering) was calculated from seed sowing to the time when the first petals opened. DNA and RNA Gel Blot Analysis—DNA was extracted from tobacco leaves by using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide. 20 μg of DNA was digested with EcoRV and separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. RNA was prepared by using TRIzol (Invitrogen). For each sample, 20 μg of RNA was loaded onto an RNA gel. Both DNA and RNA were transferred to nylon membranes and hybridized with the probe for NtCBK1 that was synthesized by random primer extension (Promega). Hybridization was done under high stringency conditions (9Zhang L. Liu B.F. Liang S.P. Jones R.L. Lu Y.-T. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 145-157Google Scholar). Cloning and Characterization of NtCBK1 CDNA—A tobacco cDNA library was screened with maize MCK1 as a probe, resulting in the isolation of a cDNA clone (designated NtCBK1) having a 2.5-kb insert (GenBank™ accession number AF435450). NtCBK1 contains an open reading frame of 1800 bp and Northern blot analyses of RNA from tobacco revealed a single band of about 2.5 kb (data not shown), consistent with the predicted size of the cDNA. The deduced amino acid sequence of NtCBK1 consists of 599 residues with a calculated molecular mass of 66.0 kDa. To search for a putative function of NtCBK1, a data base comparison was conducted to identify homology between NtCBK1 and other genes with known functions. NtCBK1 contains all 11 subdomains characteristic of the protein kinase catalytic domain (38Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Google Scholar), and shares high sequence identity with CBKs and CDPK-related protein kinases, including maize MCK1 (GenBank™ accession number 1839597; 69%) (7Lu Y.T. Hidaka H. Feldman L.J. Planta. 1996; 199: 18-24Google Scholar), OsCBK (GenBank™ accession number AF368282; 56%) (9Zhang L. Liu B.F. Liang S.P. Jones R.L. Lu Y.-T. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 145-157Google Scholar), carrot CDPK-related protein kinases (GenBank™ accession number 1103386; 59%) (39Lindzen E. Choi J.H. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 28: 785-797Google Scholar), and NtCBK2 (GenBank™ accession number AF435452; 59%) (40Hua W. Liang S. Lu Y.-T. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 291-302Google Scholar), suggesting that NtCBK1 could be a Ca2+/CaM-related protein kinase (Fig. 1). It is also noted that NtCBK1 does not contain Ca2+ binding EF-hands at its C terminus as in CDPKs (41Harper J.F. Sussman M.R. Schaller G.E. Putanam-Evans C. Charbonneau H. Harmon A.C. Science. 1991; 252: 951-954Google Scholar) and CCaMKs (12Liu Z. Xia M. Poovaiah B.W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 38: 889-897Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Analysis of NtCBK1 with Anthewin software indicated that the amino acid sequence at positions 436–455 of NtCBK1 could form a CaM-binding α-helix domain (33Lu Y.T. Harrington H.M. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1994; 32: 413-422Google Scholar, 42O'Neil K.T. DeGrado W.F. Trends Biol. Sci. 1990; 15: 59-64Google Scholar). These structural features strongly suggest that NtCBK1 is a CaM-binding protein kinase. Characterization of the CaM-binding Domain of NtCBK1—To identify the putative CaM-binding domain of NtCBK1, four expression constructs (NtCBK1, T1–416, T1–455, and T436–599) were made to express full and truncated forms of NtCBK1 (Fig. 2A). Whereas T1–455 contained the N-terminal catalytic domain, and a putative CaM-binding domain (at positions 436–455) at its C terminus, T1–416 had the same amino acid sequences of T1–455, but"

Recently, a novel delayed rectifier-like K+ current mediated by activation of the cardiac M3 receptors (designated IKM3) was identified, which is distinct from IKACh and other known K+ currents. While IKACh is known to be a Gi protein-gated K+ channel, the signal transduction mechanisms for IKM3 activation remained unexplored. We studied IKM3 with whole-cell patch clamp and macropatch clamp techniques. Whole cell IKM3 activated by choline persisted with minimal rundown over 2 h in presence of internal GTP. When GTP was replaced by guanyl-5′-yl thiophosphate, IKM3 demonstrated rapid and extensive rundown. While IKACh (induced by ACh) was markedly reduced in cells pretreated with pertussis toxin, IKM3 was unaltered. Intracellular application of antibodies targeting α-subunit of Gi/o protein suppressed IKACh without affecting IKM3. Antibodies targeting the N and the C terminus, respectively, of Gq protein α-subunit substantially depressed IKM3 but failed to alter IKACh. The antibody against β-subunits of G proteins inhibited both IKACh and IKM3. IKM3 activated by choline in the cell-attached mode of macropatches persisted in the cell-free configuration. Application of purified Gq protein α-subunit or βγ-subunit of G proteins or guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) to the internal solution activated IKM3-like currents in inside-out patches. Our findings revealed a novel aspect of receptor-channel signal transduction mechanisms, and IKM3 represents the first Gq protein-coupled K+ channel.

We discovered that the cardiac M3 receptors mediate the activation of a novel delayed rectifier K+ current (we have named it IKM3) distinct from IKACh and other known K+ currents. IKACh is characterized by strong inward rectification, whereas IKM3 conducts a delayed rectifier-like K+ current. We also found that M3 receptors and IKM3 play a significant role in regulating heart rates, cardiac resting membrane potential, and membrane repolarization (1Shi H. Wang H. Lu Y. Yang B. Wang Z. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 169: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 2Wang H. Shi H. Lu Y. Yang B. Wang Z. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 162: 1725-1734Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The findings suggest that we are no longer able to consider parasympathetic control of the heart as due to a simple ACh-M2 interaction; we have to understand cholinergic effects in terms of the consequence of activating multiple subtypes of mAChRs, with potentially varying signal transduction and effector systems (such as different K+ channels) (6Shi H. Wang H. Li D. Nattel S. Wang Z. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 2004; 14: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).The M1 and M3 receptors are characterized biochemically by stimulation of a large inositol phosphate response while having a small stimulatory effect on adenylate cyclase activity. The M2 and M4 isoforms are typically linked to an inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity and only a modest stimulation of inositol phosphate release (12Hulme E.C. Birdsall N.J. Buckley N.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1990; 30: 633-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar, 13Felder C.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). IKACh is a G protein-gated K+ channel and its activation is a result of interactions between M2 receptors and K+ channels coupled directly via PTX-sensitive Gi proteins (14Reuveny E. Slesinger P.A. Inglese J. Morales J.M. Iñlguez-Lluhl J.A. Lefkovitz R.J. Bourne H.R. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1994; 370: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 15Wickman K. Clapham D.E. Physiol.

Rev. 1998; 50: 723-757PubMed Google Scholar), i.e. activation of IKACh is critically determined by Gi protein activity and is independent of the downstream components of the Gi protein signaling pathway. It remained unknown how the M3 receptors mediate activation of IKM3. Since M3 receptors have been found to mainly activate the Gq-phospholipase C (PLC)-protein kinase C (PKC) pathway, we hypothesized that Gq protein plays a critical role in IKM3 activation upon M3 receptor stimulation in cardiac cells. The present study was designed to examine this hypothesis so as to elucidate the signal transduction mechanisms of M3-mediated activation of IKM3, as compared with M2-IKACh coupling.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Isolation and Culture—Single canine atrial myocytes were isolated as previously described (1Shi H.

The dispersed cells were stored in KB medium (20 mm KCl, 10 mm KH2PO4, 25 mm glucose, 70 mm potassium glutamate, 10 mm β-hydroxybutyric acid; 20 mm taurine, 10 mm EGTA, 0.1% albumin, and 40 mm mannitol, pH adjusted to 7.4 with KOH) at 4 °C for later electrophysiological experiments. Use of animals was approved by the Animal Care Committee of Montreal Heart Institute. Human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG)-expressing HEK293 cells were culture as described previously (17Wang J.

The following blockers were included in the perfusate (Tyrode solution) to minimize contaminating currents: CdCl2 (200 μm, L-type Ca2+ current), 4-aminopyridine (1 mm, transient outward K+ currents), dofetilide (1 μm, rapid delayed rectifier K+ current), and chromanol 293B (10 μm, slow delayed rectifier K+ current). IKACh was activated in the presence of 1 μm ACh in the superfusate, and the amplitude was measured as the current amplitude at the end of the test pulses. IKM3 was activated in the presence of 10 mm choline in the superfusate, and the amplitude was measured as the activating currents after subtraction of the time-independent leak current. Dog atrial ultra-rapid delayed rectifier K+ current (IKur.d) was recorded in the presence of atropine (100 nm) to prevent IKM3 and IKACh (18Yue L. Feng J. Wang Z. Nattel S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 516: 385-398Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For better comparison, all mean data were expressed as current density calculated by normalizing to the cell capacitance.Macropatch Recording—Macropatch currents were measured in cell-attached and inside-out configuration by using pipettes made from borosilicate glass with tip openings of ∼20 μm as previously described (19Wang Z. Kiehn J. Yang Q. Brown A.M. Wible B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28311-28317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The bath solution contained (in mm): 110 potassium aspartate, 20 KCl, 5 Mg-ATP, 0.1 GTP, and 10 HEPES (pH adjusted to 7.3 with KOH). The pipette (external) solution contained (mm): 136 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 glucose, 10 EGTA, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3). Traces at each potential represent an average of 5–10 sweeps.The antibodies used in this study were all purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (the specificity of the antibodies was tested by the company). Antibodies were added to the pipette solution and applied intracellularly by dialysis. Currents were recorded right after membrane rupture before dialysis took place as base-line control data, and the same recordings were repeated 20 min after membrane rupture with complete dialysis, and the data reflected the effects of antibodies.Cloning of Cardiac M3 Receptor cDNA Fragment—Gene-specific primer pairs (tggaacaacaatgatgctgc (forward) and ccttttccgcttagtgatctg (reverse)) were designed based on published sequence of human m3 (20Peralta E. Ashkenazi A. Winslow J. Smith D. Ramachandran J. Capon D. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3923-3929Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from dog atrium as previously described in detail (19Wang Z. Kiehn J. Yang Q. Brown A.M. Wible B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28311-28317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). First-strand cDNA resulting from reverse transcription was used as a template for PCR amplification, and the PCR products of desired size were subjected to sequencing analysis.Data Analysis—Group data are mean ± S.E. Paired t tests were used for single comparisons. Kinetics were analyzed with CLAMPFIT (pCLAMP 8.0) or Graphpad Prism.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONDepolarizing voltage steps activated IKM3 in the presence of continued stimulation of M3 receptors by choline (10 mm) in the bathing solution, which was otherwise absent before choline application. The current was highly sensitive to M3-selective antagonists p-F-HHSiD (20 nm), darifenacin (20 nm), or 4-DAMP (10 nm) (Fig. 1B). To test whether G protein is required for IKM3 activation by M3 receptor stimulation, GTP of the pipette solution was replaced by GDPβS (1 mm, a nonphosphorylatable analogue of GDP) to deplete the cytosolic GTP. Recordings were made right after membrane rupture before dialysis took place as base-line control data and from 5 to 30 min after membrane rupture to determine changes caused by omission of intracellular GTP. As shown in Fig. 1A, IKM3 had little rundown over a 2-h recording period with a GTP pipette. However, with GDPβS in the pipette, the current demonstrated a quick decay starting within 5 min after formation of whole-cell configuration and virtually disappeared 10 min after membrane rupture, indicating a requirement of G proteins for IKM3 activation.It is known that stimulation of M2 receptors activates the PTX-sensitive Gi protein, which in turn interacts with IKACh to open up the channels. That is, M2 receptors are coupled to IKACh via the membrane-delimited Gi/o proteins, or in other words, IKACh is a Gi protein-gated K+ channel (14Reuveny E. Slesinger P.A. Inglese J. Morales J.M. Iñlguez-Lluhl J.A. Lefkovitz R.J. Bourne H.R. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1994; 370: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 15Wickman K. Clapham D.E. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 865-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 16Yamada M. Inanobe A. Kurachi Y. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 723-757PubMed Google Scholar). Our experiments confirmed this point. The possible role of PTX-sensitive G proteins in M3-IKM3 coupling was also investigated. As shown in Fig. 1B, while IKACh was clearly suppressed in cells pretreated with PTX (2 μg/ml) for 90 min in the recording solution, IKM3 was unaltered. Similar results were obtained when PTX (2 μg/ml) was applied intracellularly by dialysis (data not shown). In another set of experiments, anti-Gαi/o antibody targeting the C terminus of Gi/o protein α-subunit was applied to the cytosol of the cells by dialysis through the pipette solution. Consistent with the PTX data, anti-Gαi/o antibody (15 μg/ml) remarkably diminished IKACh but left IKM3 unchanged (Fig. 1C). The results from the above experiments, while confirming the role of Gi/o protein in the coupling between M2 receptors and IKACh, ruled out contribution of Gi/o protein to IKM3 activation by choline. Studies on mAChR function by delivering antibodies into the cytoplasm of cells by pipette solution dialysis have been frequently employed by other researchers (21Morel J.L. Macrez N. Mironneau J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 121: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 22Wang Y.X. Fleischmann B.K. Kotlikoff M.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C500-C507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).We then turned to test the possible role of Gq protein. We used two different antibodies: anti-Gαq(N) and anti-Gαq/11(C), antibodies targeting the N and the C-terminal regions of a Gq protein α-subunit, respectively. Clearly, both anti-Gαq(N) and anti-Gαq/11(C) at a concentration of 10 μg/ml produced substantial suppression of IKM3, whereas IKACh was unaffected. Elevating anti-Gαq(N) antibody concentration to 50 μg/ml nearly abolished IKM3, and the inhibitory effects were not reproduced when the antibody was preinactivated by boiling (Fig. 2A). There is evidence indicating that the C-terminal region of Gq protein α-subunits is responsible for interaction with receptor proteins (14Reuveny E. Slesinger P.A. Inglese J. Morales J.M. Iñlguez-Lluhl J.A. Lefkovitz R.J. Bourne H.R. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1994; 370: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 23Caulfield M.P. Jones S. Vallis Y. Buckley N.J. Kim G.D.

Thus, the results from anti-Gαq/11(C) antibody would attest the requirement of whole Gq protein for IKM3 activation but do not allow us to distinguish which Gq protein heterotrimer subunit (Gα or Gβγ) transduces the signal from M3 receptors to IKM3. It is also known that the N terminus of Gq protein bears a region critical for effector function (15Wickman K. Clapham D.E. Physiol.

Kim G.D. Milligan G. Brown D.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1994; 477: 415-422Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The anti-Gαq(N) antibody is designed to target the “active” α-subunit-GTP complex. The ability of this antibody to suppress IKM3 would therefore suggest the importance of the α-subunit of Gq protein in interacting with IKM3.Fig. 2Role of Gq protein in IKM3 activation.A, effects of anti-Gαq(N) antibody (10 μg/ml) on IKACh and IKM3. t test indicates significant reduction of IKM3 by anti-Gαq antibodies (p < 0.05 for potentials from –20 to +50 mV, n = 10) but no effect on IKACh (n = 8). Boiling inactivated anti-Gαq(N) antibody lost the effect on IKM3 (p > 0.05, n = 5). The inset shows the suppressing effects of anti-Gαq (C) antibody (10 μg/ml) on IKM3 (n = 3).

The βγ-subunit of Gi/o protein is known to play a major role over α-subunit for IKACh activation (14Reuveny E. Slesinger P.A. Inglese J. Morales J.M. Iñlguez-Lluhl J.A. Lefkovitz R.J. Bourne H.R.

We then further studied the effects of anti-βcom (against various β-subunits including β1, β2, β3, and β4) on IKM3. Our data demonstrated the ability of anti-βcom antibody (10 μg/ml) to inhibit both IKACh and IKM3 (Fig. 2B). This finding indicates that Gβγ may also be a functional subunit in M3-IKM3 signaling system.Activation of Gq protein can result in activation of PLC that hydrolyzes the phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to form 1,4,5-inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 stimulates Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. Increase in [Ca2+]i and DAG further activates the downstream PKC activity. Our data showed that PLC inhibitor U73122 (1 μm), neutralizing monoclonal PIP2-specific antibody (60 nm), a DAG analogue OAG (10 μm 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol), IP3 (100 μm), PMA (a phorbol ester activator of PKC, 100 nm), and Bis (bisindolylmaleimide, a selective PKC inhibitor, 40 nm) all failed to affect IKM3 (Fig. 2C). Positive control experiments were performed to assure the effectiveness of for these agents. The effects of U73122, OAG, PMA, and Bis were verified with IKur.d, which we have previously shown to be modulated by PKC (18Yue L. Feng J. Wang Z. Nattel S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 516: 385-398Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). While bath application of the α1-adrenoreceptor agonist phenylephrine (10 μm) caused enhancement of IKur.d, co-application with U73122 or Bis reversed the effects (Fig. 2C). Superfusion with either PMA or OAG directly increased IKur.d, and the increases were reversed by Bis. The effectiveness of PIP2 was verified by experiments showing that PIP2 (10 μm) included in the pipette increased the K+ current carried by human ether-a-go-go channels (IHERG) and shifted the activation of IHERG toward hyperpolarizing potentials, effects consistent with the previous findings (17Wang J. Zhang Y. Wang H. Han H. Nattel S. Yang B. Wang Z. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 141: 586-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 27Bian J. Cui J. McDonald T.V. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 1168-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Since our pipette solution contained 10 mm EGTA, and L-type Ca2+ current was inhibited by Cd2+ present in the superfusate, it is unlikely that IKM3 activation was related to [Ca2+]i. This possibility was further excluded by additional experiments showing the lack of effects of intracellular application of heparin (1 mm) on IKM3 (Fig. 2C).To investigate whether the interaction between Gq protein and IKM3 is membrane-delimited, we further employed macropatch to study the activation of IKM3. With choline- or ACh-free pipette (external) solution, IKM3 or IKACh was observed in neither cell-attached nor inside-out patches. Addition of choline (10 mm) or ACh (1 μm) to the superfusate (internal solution) still failed to activate any currents in the inside-out mode. However, when choline was included in the pipette solution, a current characteristic of IKM3 was activated in the cell-attached patch and sustained after a membrane excision into an inside-out patch during the 30-min recording period with little run-down (Fig. 3A). Similarly, when ACh was present in the pipette solution IKACh was induced in both cell-attached and inside-out configurations. When GTPγS (10 μm, a nonhydrolyzable analogue of GTP) was present in the superfusate (internal solution), but with choline and ACh absent in the pipette in the inside-out patches, only IKACh-like currents were activated in seven out of eight patches tested, and there was no apparent concomitant activation of IKM3-like currents (Fig. 3B). Only when the internal GTPγS was elevated to 50 μm did IKM3-like currents become manifested in five out of eight patches, consistent with the previous finding that higher concentrations of GTPγS are required for Gαq activity relative to Gαi/o (28Hepler J.R. Kozasa T. Smrcka A.V. Simon M.I. Rhee S.G. Sternweis P.C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14367-14375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To separate the IKM3-like currents from concomitantly activated IKACh-like currents, 2 mm Ba2+ was added to the superfusate to inhibit the latter. The I-V relationships of IKACh-like and IKM3-like currents resemble those of whole-cell IKACh and IKM3, with inwardly and outwardly rectifying properties, respectively (Fig. 3B). The results from our macropatch recordings indicate that IKM3 is activated by G protein in a membrane-delimited fashion.Fig. 3Macropatch study of IKM3.A, macropatch recording of IKACh and IKM3. Time course of the currents activated by ACh or choline and I-V relationships of the currents (n = 6) constructed with the currents recorded 20 min after formation of inside-out patches. B, IKACh-like currents activated by 10 μm GTPγS included in the superfusate (internal solution) in an inside-out patch (n = 7). Macropatch IKM3-like current was measured in the presence of 2 mm Ba2+ to inhibit the IKACh-like current. C, activation of IKACh - and IKM3-like currents by purified GαI-(100 nm, n = 5) and Gαq-(100 nm, n = 6) subunits, respectively. D, activation of IKACh-like (n = 4) and IKM3-like (n = 5) currents by purified G -subunit (10 βγ μm/ml). Macropatch IKM3-like current was measured in the presence of 2 mm Ba2+ to inhibit the IKACh-like current.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To further investigate the role of α- and βγ-subunits of G proteins in IKM3 activation, we performed experiments using the Gαi and Gαq proteins purified from Sf9 cells infected with baculoviruses encoding the recombinant Gαi- and Gαq-subunits, respectively, and the purified βγ-subunit of G proteins (Chemicon International, Inc.). Application of Gαi to intracellular side of the inside-out macropatch induced small IKACh, but failed to induce IKM3 in all eight patches tested. By comparison, application of Gαq activated an IKM3-like current in four out five cells, but in none of six cells tested was IKACh induced by Gαq (Fig. 3, C and D). On the other hand, perfusion with the βγ-subunit of G protein activated large IKACh current and IKM3 too (Fig. 3D). It is therefore possible that the signal generated upon M3 activation requires Gαq for specificity, but the signal is transduced by both Gα-subunit and Gβγ dimer. Interestingly, one elegant study focusing on the M3 receptor signal transduction for Ca2+ release in Xenopus oocytes (29Stehno-Bittel L. Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Perez-Terzic C. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30068-30074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) revealed a similar mechanism to what was found in this study.If it is true that IKM3 activation by the M3 receptors is mediated by Gq protein, then the conserved sequence of mACh for G protein coupling must be present in the heart. Indeed, we cloned a cDNA fragment representing dog cardiac M3 receptor (GenBank™ accession number AF056305) spans a part of the third intracellular loop thought to contain a region critical for G protein binding. Particularly, our fragment covers the first 16–21 amino acids of the third intracellular domain, which determine the G protein coupling specificity (30Wess J. Trends in Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 308-313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 31Blüml K. Mutschler E. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11537-11541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This cardiac m3 cDNA fragment shares ∼81% homology to the same region of human brain m3 gene (20Peralta E. Ashkenazi A. Winslow J. Smith D. Ramachandran J. Capon D.

The Elongator complex was first identified as a component of a hyperphosphorylated RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) 1The abbreviations used are: RNAPII, RNA polymerase II; HAT, histone acetyltransferase; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase. holoenzyme isolated from yeast chromatin (1Otero G.

One of the subunits of Elongator, Elp3, contains domains conserved among histone acetyltransferases (HATs) (2Wittschieben B.O. Otero G. de Bizemont T. Fellows J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Ohba R. Li Y. Allis C.D. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 123-128Google Scholar), and Elongator has HAT activity directed against histone H3 and to a lesser extent H4 in vitro (3Winkler G.S. Kristjuhan A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 2002; 99: 3517-3522Google Scholar), raising the possibility that Elongator acetylates histones during RNAPII transcript elongation. Elp3 HAT activity is essential for Elongator function in vivo as point mutations that abolish the catalytic function of Elp3 in vitro also confer the full range of elp phenotypes (4Wittschieben B.O. Fellows J. Du W. Stillman D.J. Svejstrup J.Q. EMBO J.l. 2000; 19: 3060-3068Google Scholar). elp phenotypes include temperature sensitivity at 39 °C, salt sensitivity, and slow adaptation to growth on carbon sources such as galactose (1Otero G. Fellows J. Li Y. de Bizemont T. Dirac A.M. Gustafsson C.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 109-118Google Scholar, 5Fellows J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12896-12899Google Scholar). elp cells are also sensitive to caffeine, Calcofluor White, and 6-azauracil (6Frohloff F. Fichtner L. Jablonowski D. Breunig K.D. Schaffrath R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1993-2003Google Scholar, 7Fichtner L. Frohloff F. Burkner K. Larsen M. Breunig K.D. Schaffrath R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 783-791Google Scholar). Significantly, in all cases tested, elp phenotypes correlate with a failure of the mutant cells to activate, in a timely manner, the genes required for growth under the new conditions (1Otero G. Fellows J. Li Y. de Bizemont T. Dirac A.M. Gustafsson C.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 109-118Google Scholar). An elp deletion in combination with the deletion of different genes encoding transcription factors confers synthetic phenotypes. Thus, elp3 in combination with rpb9 (encoding an RNA-PII subunit) is lethal (8Van Mullem V. Wery M. Werner M. Vandenhaute J. Thuriaux P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10220-10225Google Scholar), as is the combination of an elp3 and ctk1 mutation (CTK1 encodes a subunit of the CTD kinase, CTDK1) (9Jona G. Wittschieben B.O. Svejstrup J.Q. Gileadi O. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 267: 31-36Google Scholar). Cells expressing a conditional allele of SPT16 (encoding the largest subunit of yeast FACT-CP complex) also display a synthetic phenotype in combination with elp3 mutation (10Formosa T. Ruone S. Adams M.D. Olsen A.E. Eriksson P. Yu Y. Rhoades A.R. Kaufman P.D. Stillman D.J. Genetics. 2002; 162: 1557-1571Google Scholar). Recent data have shown that Elongator also genetically interacts with Mediator, Rad6 ubiquitin ligase, Paf1 complex, and Rpd3-Sin3 complex. 2S. E. Kong, M. S. Kobor, N. J. Krogan, J. F. Greenblatt, and J. Q. Svejstrup, unpublished results. Finally, combining the mutation of elp3 with gcn5 (encoding the catalytic subunit of the SAGA-ADA HAT complexes) confers severe growth defects, which are not seen in either of the single mutants (4Wittschieben B.O. Fellows J. Du W. Stillman D.J. Svejstrup J.Q. EMBO J.l. 2000; 19: 3060-3068Google Scholar). Significantly, the gcn5 elp3 double mutant has reduced levels of histone H3 acetylation in several genes compared with the single mutants, and low levels of acetylation in the coding region of these genes correlates with reductions in gene transcription. By contrast, low levels of acetylation in the promoter of genes does not correlate with reduced transcription nor with reduced promoter occupancy by the TATA-binding protein (11Kristjuhan A. Walker J. Suka N. Grunstein M. Roberts D. Cairns B.R. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 925-933Google Scholar). Recent experiments using RNA-immunoprecipitation have shown that Elongator is indeed present in the coding region of active genes in vivo (12Gilbert C. Kristjuhan A. Winkler G.S. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 457-464Google Scholar). The Elongator complex was first thought to consist of three subunits, named Elp1, Elp2, and Elp3 (now called core Elongator) (1Otero G. Fellows J. Li Y. de Bizemont T. Dirac A.M. Gustafsson C.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 109-118Google Scholar), but later purification of the complex from a yeast strain expressing epitope-tagged Elp1 has shown that the active complex, holo-Elongator, consists of six subunits (Elp1–Elp6) (13Winkler G.S. Petrakis T.G. Ethelberg S. Tokunaga M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32743-32749Google Scholar, 14Krogan N.J. Greenblatt J.F. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2001; 276: 29628-29631Google Scholar), which are organized in two three-subunit subcomplexes (13Winkler G.S. Petrakis T.G. Ethelberg S. Tokunaga M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32743-32749Google Scholar, 15Li Y. Takagi Y. Jiang Y. Tokunaga M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29628-29631Google Scholar). Significantly, deletion of any one of the (ELP) genes encoding these six subunits confers more or less identical phenotypes, and new phenotypes are not detected upon concomitant deletion of two or three ELP genes (5Fellows J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12896-12899Google Scholar, 13Winkler G.S. Petrakis T.G. Ethelberg S. Tokunaga M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32743-32749Google Scholar). These data suggest a tight functional connection between the proteins comprising the Elongator complex. Consistent with this idea, holo-Elongator, but not core Elongator, has HAT activity even though both complexes contain the catalytic Elp3 subunit (13Winkler G.S. Petrakis T.G. Ethelberg S. Tokunaga M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32743-32749Google Scholar). Here we investigate the molecular architecture of Elongator complex and show that the only ELP gene that can be deleted without significant loss of Elongator integrity is ELP2. Surprisingly, an Elongator complex lacking Elp2 even retains the ability to acetylate histones in vitro. We also show that the association of Elongator with nascent RNA in vivo requires Elp3 but not Elp2 or Elp4.

Two-hybrid Interactions—The coding sequence of all of the genes encoding the Elongator proteins were cloned in both “GAL4-activation domain”- and “GAL4-binding domain”-based vectors provided from the GAL4 two-hybrid phagemid vector kit (Stratagene). To detect interactions, the plasmids were introduced in genetically modified yeast cells provided from the Matchmaker Library Construction & Screening Kit (Clontech). The interaction studies were done according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Expression of Recombinant GST and GST-Elp5 in Bacteria—To generate a GST-Elp5 fusion protein, the open reading frame of the ELP5 gene was cloned in the pGEX-3X vector (Amersham Biosciences), and the plasmid was introduced in BL21 DE3 competent bacteria. Cells were grown at 37 °C and induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. After cell resuspension in phosphate-buffered saline, the cell suspension was incubated for 30 min on ice with lysozyme (50 mg/ml) and then subjected to sonication. The extract was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with Triton X-100 in a final concentration of 1%, and the soluble supernatant was collected after a 10-min 12,000 rpm spin at 4 °C. This soluble supernatant contained GST-Elp5, which was purified and immobilized on glutathione beads (Amersham Biosciences) by incubation for 30 min at room temperature. The soluble GST control protein was produced in the same way. In Vitro Transcribed/Translated Proteins—The recombinant Elp4 and Elp6 proteins used for the in vitro pull-down experiments were produced using the TnT T7-coupled wheat germ extract systems (Promega) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The DNA template used was pBluescript II KS (±), into which the coding sequence of the two genes was cloned. Details are available on request. In Vitro Pull-down Experiments—Immobilized baculovirus-expressed histidine-tagged Elp1 or Elp2 and bacterially expressed GST or GST-Elp5 proteins were mixed with the product of in vitro transcription/translation (Elp4 or Elp6) reactions in a buffer containing 250 mm potassium acetate, 100 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 20% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1× proteinase inhibitors, and 4 mm β-mercaptoethanol and incubated overnight. The beads were washed three times before the bound proteins were separated by PAGE on a 10% SDS gel. The Elp4 and Elp6 proteins showed weak nonspecific binding to nickel-agarose. Therefore, these beads were washed three times with the above buffer but containing 30 mm imidazole. Other Assays—Histone acetyltransferase reactions (15 μl) were carried out as described (3Winkler G.S. Kristjuhan A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 2002; 99: 3517-3522Google Scholar). RNA immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out as described by Gilbert et al. (12Gilbert C. Kristjuhan A. Winkler G.S. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 457-464Google Scholar). In a multisubunit protein complex, the stability of an individual subunit can be dependent on the presence or integrity of the other subunits. We examined the amount of individual Elongator subunits present in extracts derived from different elp deletion strains. Fig. 1A (top panels) shows the results of an analysis where whole cell extracts were immunoblotted and probed with anti-Elp3 antibodies. As a loading control, reactivity with an anti-tubulin antibody was used. Interestingly, the Elp3 protein either could not be detected or was present at very low levels in cells lacking the ELP1 gene. In cells lacking any of the other ELP genes, the Elp3 levels were also somewhat reduced, but the protein was still detectable (Fig. 1A, top panel, compare the tubulin/Elp3 ratio in wild type (WT) cells with that in the mutants). By contrast, Elp4, Elp5, and Elp6 were only absent from extracts derived from strains in which their encoding gene was deleted (Fig. 1A, middle and bottom panels). Importantly, Northern blot analysis of RNA from the same cells showed that the mRNA level of the ELP3 gene was comparable in wild type and all of the elpΔ cells (Fig. 1B) suggesting that reduced protein stability rather than gene expression was causing the effect. We conclude that deletion of the ELP1 results in substantial destabilization of the Elp3 protein, suggesting that the Elp1 protein is required for the integrity of Elp3, in all likelihood because of a direct interaction between these proteins. Protein-Protein Interactions among Elongator Subunits—To investigate protein-protein interactions in the Elongator complex, we next performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments in different elp deletion strains. For these experiments whole cell extracts were prepared from cells expressing a tagged version of an Elongator subunit while lacking another one, for example from elp2 cells expressing Elp1-HA. To enable high efficiency immunoprecipitation and to increase specificity, whole cell extracts were first subjected to chromatography on Bio-Rex before being loaded onto 12CA5-conjugated Sepharose A beads. As shown in Fig. 2A, Elongator could, under those conditions, be specifically immunoprecipitated from wild type cell extracts carrying either Elp1 or Elp4 tagged with an HA epitope but not from control cells that did not express a tagged Elp protein. Remarkably, when the ELP2 gene was deleted, Elp1 still interacted with the five remaining subunits, although the three smaller proteins Elp4, Elp5, and Elp6 appeared to be somewhat substoichiometric (Fig. 2B, left panel). This experiment indicates that the Elp2 protein is not required for the integrity of the Elongator complex. When extracts from cells lacking the ELP3 gene were used, only the Elp1 protein was detected in the precipitates, which indicates that none of the remaining four subunits interact strongly with Elp1 (Fig. 2B, middle panel). We conclude that the Elp3 protein is not only essential for catalytic function but also for the integrity of the Elongator complex. In the absence of Elp4, the Elp1 protein could still interact with Elp3 (Fig. 2B, right panel). However, in this case the Elp2, Elp5, and Elp6 proteins could not be detected even in the inputs. This can be explained in two ways: either those proteins no longer co-elute with Elp1 and Elp3 from Bio-Rex if Elp4 is absent, or deletion of the ELP4 gene results in reduced Elp2, Elp5, and Elp6 protein levels. Our previous experiments showed that Elp5 and Elp6 protein levels were not decreased significantly in any of the elp mutants (Fig. 1A), pointing to a lack of interaction with core Elongator as the likely explanation. Unfortunately, the Elp2 protein could not be detected in this case in the Bio-Rex-70 eluate (and could generally not be detected in crude whole cell extracts with our polyclonal anti-Elp2 antibody), precluding any conclusions on the fate of this protein in elp4 extracts. We conclude that Elp4 is required for the association of Elp2 and the small Elp4/5/6 complex with Elp1 and Elp3. When extracts from elp5 cells expressing Elp4-HA protein were used, Elp4 only co-immunoprecipitated Elp6 and low amounts of Elp3 (Fig. 2C, left panel). This suggests that Elp4 interacts directly with Elp6 and that neither of these two proteins interacts strongly with any of the three larger proteins Elp1, Elp2, and Elp3, although a weak Elp4/Elp6-Elp3 interaction was evident. The absence of a signal for Elp1, even in the input, again precluded firm conclusions on the fate of this protein in elp5 cells. However, it was obvious from the previous experiment with elp3Δ cells that Elp1 does not interact directly with Elp4 or Elp6 (Fig. 2B, middle panel). In elp6 cells expressing Elp4-HA protein, Elp4 also only co-precipitated a small amount of Elp3 (Fig. 2C, right panel), supporting the notion that these proteins interact directly, albeit weakly. Elp4 did not interact with Elp5 in the absence of Elp6. As Elp5 is stable in elp6 cells (Fig. 1A, middle panels), this indicates that it is incorporated into the small subcomplex in an Elp6-dependent manner. We conclude from the above experiments that there is a direct interaction between Elp1 and Elp3, as well as between Elp4 and Elp6. Because a core-Elongator complex consisting of Elp1, Elp2, and Elp3 has previously been isolated (1Otero G. Fellows J. Li Y. de Bizemont T. Dirac A.M. Gustafsson C.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 109-118Google Scholar), the absence Elp2 in Elp1-precipitates from elp3 cells also indicate that interactions with Elp3 are required for the incorporation of Elp2 into core-Elongator. Surprisingly, the co-immunoprecipitation experiments do not indicate any strong direct binary interactions between any individual protein in the Elp4/5/6 module and any one of the proteins in core Elongator. This suggests that it is primarily novel interaction surfaces created by the association of Elp1, Elp2, and Elp3 in core-Elongator, and Elp4, Elp5, and Elp6 in the small subcomplex, respectively, that are important for the later association of these subassemblies into holo-Elongator. Pairwise Elongator Protein Interactions—To compliment the co-immunoprecipitation studies, pairwise interactions between individual Elongator proteins were examined by use of the yeast two-hybrid system. The genes encoding all the Elongator subunits were cloned in-frame with the activation domain and the DNA-binding domains of the GAL4 activator, respectively, and tester yeast strains were transformed with combinations of these 12 plasmids. All possible combinations of pairwise Elongator proteins interactions were tested in both directions, but, surprisingly, the only interaction detected was between Elp4 and Elp6 (Fig. 3A, negative results not shown). Finally, we sought to investigate the in vitro pairwise interactions of several Elongator components (Fig. 3B). Purified recombinant His-tagged Elp1 and His-tagged Elp2 proteins were obtained via expression in insect cells and recombinant GST-Elp5 via expression in bacteria, and Elp4 and Elp6 were transcribed/translated in vitro. Unfortunately, despite attempts in several expression systems, we were unable to obtain soluble recombinant or in vitro transcribed/translated Elp3 protein. Examples of the results obtained are shown in Fig. 3B. Of all of the many combinations that were tested, only a direct interaction between Elp5 and Elp6 was detected. Taken together, these results make it possible to propose a model to describe the molecular architecture of the Elongator complex (Fig. 4). In the large core-Elongator subcomplex, Elp1 protein interacts with Elp3 but does not interact strongly with Elp2 in the absence of Elp3. This suggests a direct Elp2-Elp3 interaction. On the other hand, the small subcomplex is formed based on direct interactions between Elp4 and Elp6 and between Elp6 and Elp5. Although not absolutely required, the Elp2 protein serves to somewhat stabilize the core Elongator-Elp4/5/6 interaction, whereas Elp3 is essential for the integrity of the complex. Furthermore, a weak interaction between Elp3 and Elp4 was detected. Based on these results we suggest that, rather than relying solely on strong binary interactions between individual subunits of the respective subcomplexes, the formation of the small subcomplex creates new interaction surfaces to enable contacts with Elp3 and Elp2, as well as with novel interaction surfaces created by the association of Elp1, Elp2, and Elp3 into core-Elongator (Fig. 4). The WD40 Repeat Protein, Elp2, Is Dispensable for the in Vitro HAT Activity of Elongator—The data presented above revealed that although an elp2 strain displayed the typical Elongator phenotypes (5Fellows J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12896-12899Google Scholar), the remaining five subunits still exist as a complex in these cells. To investigate whether the five-subunit elp2Δ complex also retained Elongator activity, we purified the “mutant” complex and tested its in vitro HAT activity. This was particularly relevant, because several HAT and histone deacetylase complexes harbor subunits, which, like Elp2, contain WD40 repeats. It has thus been suggested that WD40 repeats might be involved in contacting histones to facilitate the acetyltransferase and deacetylation reactions, respectively (18Vermaak D. Wade P.A. Jones P.L. Shi Y.B. Wolffe A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5847-5860Google Scholar, 19Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Cell. 1996; 87: 5-8Google Scholar). The purification scheme employed was identical to that used previously for the purification of a six-subunit Elongator complex from cells carrying a double affinity-tagged Elp1 protein (13Winkler G.S. Petrakis T.G. Ethelberg S. Tokunaga M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32743-32749Google Scholar). As indicated by Fig. 5A, a purified elp2Δ Elongator complex from two independent purifications retained the five other subunits, although the three smaller subunits as well as the Elp3 protein appeared to be somewhat substoichiometric compared with the wild type complex. To be able to compare the HAT activity of the elp2Δ complex with that purified from wild type cells, we therefore used similar amounts of the catalytic Elp3 subunit in the HAT reactions, with the consequence that other subunits, particularly Elp1, were present in larger amounts in the reactions containing the mutant five-subunit complex. Fig. 5B shows the result of HAT assays comparing wild type and the two independently purified mutant complexes. Surprisingly, Elongator retained in vitro HAT activity directed against H3 even in the absence of Elp2. Adding recombinant, His-tagged Elp2 to the reactions did not dramatically affect the activity (the apparent stimulation of wild type complex (Fig. 5B, lanes 1 and 2) was because of loading differences). These data demonstrate that the WD40 repeat protein Elp2 is not required for Elongator HAT activity in vitro. Elp3, but Not Elp2 or Elp4, Is Required for RNA Binding in Vivo—We have recently shown that the Elongator complex binds to RNA in vitro and that it is in close vicinity of nascent pre-mRNA in vivo (12Gilbert C. Kristjuhan A. Winkler G.S. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 457-464Google Scholar). These results indicate that Elongator is associated with active genes in living cells. To investigate the subunit requirements for RNA association in vivo, we compared Elongator RNA-immunoprecipitation in wild type, elp2, and elp4 cells expressing myc-tagged Elp3 (Fig. 6A). As shown previously (12Gilbert C. Kristjuhan A. Winkler G.S. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 457-464Google Scholar), efficient cross-linking of Elp3 protein to GAL1 mRNA was observed in wild type cells (Fig. 6A, compare Elp3-myc with no tag). Interestingly, although the levels were somewhat reduced, RNA interaction was also observed in cells lacking Elp2 (a component of core Elongator) and Elp4 (a core component of the small Elongator subcomplex). This indicates that neither the small subcomplex, nor Elp2 play crucial roles in the association of Elongator (Elp3) with transcripts in vivo. Because Elp3 levels are dramatically reduced in cells lacking Elp1, we could not investigate whether Elp1 is required for Elongator-RNA interaction. However, by tagging Elp1 rather than Elp3, the importance of the Elp3 protein for Elongator-RNA interaction could be investigated (Fig. 6B). Remarkably, Elongator-RNA interaction was ∼5-fold reduced in the absence of Elp3, and this dramatic decrease was not because of changes in the expression level of the Elp1 protein (Fig. 6B, bottom panel). Taken together, these data indicate that the Elp3 protein plays a crucial role for the association of Elongator with active genes. The results presented here represent the first comprehensive investigation of the structure-function relationship of Elongator, a histone acetyltransferase complex with a role in RNAPII transcription. Our results reveal the detailed molecular architecture of the complex and suggest roles, or unexpected lack of roles, for individual subunits. Previous work (13Winkler G.S. Petrakis T.G. Ethelberg S. Tokunaga M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32743-32749Google Scholar, 14Krogan N.J. Greenblatt J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8203-8212Google Scholar, 15Li Y. Takagi Y. Jiang Y. Tokunaga M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29628-29631Google Scholar) showed that holo-Elongator is composed of two weakly associated subcomplexes. Subsequent work by Schaffrath and co-workers (20Fichtner L. Frohloff F. Jablonowski D. Stark M.J. Schaffrath R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 817-826Google Scholar, 21Frohloff F. Jablonowski D. Fichtner L. Schaffrath R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 956-961Google Scholar) using immunoprecipitation of tagged Elongator subunits and detection of a co-precipitated differently tagged subunit gave some information about subunit requirements for Elongator stability. Although the present work confirms and significantly extends the conclusions derived from these studies, there are also surprising contradictions. For example, Frohloff et al. (21Frohloff F. Jablonowski D. Fichtner L. Schaffrath R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 956-961Google Scholar) detected the Elp3 protein in cells lacking ELP1, whereas our results indicate that normal Elp3 stability in vivo requires ELP1 (Fig. 1). Likewise, these authors concluded that the structural integrity of the small Elp4/5/6 subcomplex requires the ELP4, ELP5, and ELP6 genes, whereas our work shows that Elp4 can interact with Elp6 in the absence of ELP5 (Fig. 2C). The reasons for these differences are presently unclear. One of the theses for the architecture of the Elongator complex before starting our studies was that the WD40 repeat-containing Elp2 protein would turn out to either be essential for the integrity of the Elongator complex, or be required for its HAT activity. WD40 repeats are protein-protein interaction domains, and WD40-repeat proteins have been identified in other histone modifying/interacting proteins (18Vermaak D. Wade P.A. Jones P.L. Shi Y.B. Wolffe A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5847-5860Google Scholar, 19Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Cell. 1996; 87: 5-8Google Scholar). Surprisingly, Elp2 turned out to be dispensable for both; a five-subunit elp2Δ Elongator complex can be isolated, and this complex retains the ability to acetylate histones (Fig. 5). Elongator complex is also capable of binding RNA in the absence of ELP2 (Fig. 6). Data from Schaffrath and co-workers (20Fichtner L. Frohloff F. Jablonowski D. Stark M.J. Schaffrath R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 817-826Google Scholar) suggests that the role of Elp2 might be to allow interactions with other proteins, such as Kti12/Tot4. The Elongator-interacting protein, Kti12/Tot4 has been proposed to bridge interactions between RNAPII and Elongator. For example, the protein was shown to co-immunoprecipitate promoter DNA (chromatin immunoprecipitation) from the ADH1 gene and to also be able to co-immunoprecipitate hyperphosphorylated RNAPII (20Fichtner L. Frohloff F. Jablonowski D. Stark M.J. Schaffrath R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 817-826Google Scholar, 21Frohloff F. Jablonowski D. Fichtner L. Schaffrath R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 956-961Google Scholar). These authors also reported co-immunoprecipitation of hyperphosphorylated RNAPII with Elongator from the DNA-free soluble fraction of a yeast whole cell extract (21Frohloff F. Jablonowski D. Fichtner L. Schaffrath R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 956-961Google Scholar). For unknown reasons, we have so far not been able to reproduce these co-immunoprecipitation results, although we can detect Elongator-Kti12 interaction. 3T. G. Petrakis and J. Q. Svejstrup, unpublished data. We therefore presently favor the idea that besides the hyperphosphorylated C-terminal domain, RNA in the ternary complex might play an important stabilizing role for the Elongator-RNAPII interaction (12Gilbert C. Kristjuhan A. Winkler G.S. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 457-464Google Scholar). In contrast to the Elp2 protein, the Elp3 subunit appears to play a crucial role for all Elongator functions. It is the catalytic subunit (2Wittschieben B.O. Otero G. de Bizemont T. Fellows J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Ohba R. Li Y. Allis C.D. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 123-128Google Scholar), it is crucial for the integrity of the holo-Elongator complex (Fig. 2), and it is essential for RNA binding (Fig. 6). In light of the fact that Elp3, but not the other subunits, is conserved from Archaea to man (2Wittschieben B.O. Otero G. de Bizemont T. Fellows J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Ohba R. Li Y. Allis C.D. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 123-128Google Scholar), this is perhaps not surprising. It thus seems reasonable to expect that the fundamental functions of the Elongator complex be supplied by the abilities intrinsic to Elp3 with the other subunits playing primarily function/augmentative or regulatory roles."
https://openalex.org/W2070460866,"In the lung, caveolin-1 is expressed in both type I alveolar epithelial and endothelial cells where it is hypothesized to modulate molecular signaling activities and progression of tumorigenesis. Developmentally, caveolin-1α is expressed in fetal lung endothelial, but not epithelial, cells; in adult lung, both cell types express caveolin-1α. To test the hypothesis that caveolin-1 transcription is differentially regulated in type I and endothelial cells, we characterized the proximal promoter of the mouse caveolin-1 gene in lung cell lines to identify factors that control its cell-specific expression. We show that caveolin-1 expression is regulated by an Ets cis-element in a lung epithelial cell line, but not a lung endothelial cell line, and that three ETS family members, ETS-1, PEA3, and ERM, recognize and bind the Ets site in the epithelial cell line. Based on these findings, we have identified the Ets cis-element as a region that accounts for differential transcriptional regulation of caveolin-1 in lung epithelial and endothelial cells."

Enzymatic desymmetrization processes are of great interest to the synthetic organic chemist as they provide quantitative routes to optically active synthetic intermediates from prochiral starting materials (1Schoffers E. Golebiowski A. Johnson C. Tetrahedron. 1996; 52: 3769-3826Google Scholar). We have described the application of the enzyme 6-oxo camphor hydrolase (OCH) 1The abbreviations used are: OCH, 6-oxo camphor hydrolase; ECH, enoyl-CoA hydratase. 1The abbreviations used are: OCH, 6-oxo camphor hydrolase; ECH, enoyl-CoA hydratase. to the desymmetrization of bicyclic β-diketones for the preparation of optically active keto acids (2Grogan G.

This unusual enzymatic process is the biological equivalent of a retro-Claisen or retro-Dieckmann reaction. The carbon-carbon bond of a β-dicarbonyl species is cleaved to yield a carboxylic acid and a methylene group.

Chem. 2003; 278: 42352-42360Google Scholar). Each crotonase superfamily member shares common characteristics despite apparent differences in reaction chemistry. The substrate in each homolog described hitherto is an acyl coenzyme A thioester. Each reaction is thought to proceed via an intermediate enolate that appears to be stabilized by a conserved oxyanion hole in the enzyme tertiary structure, formed by the peptidic backbone N-Hs of the central residue of a conserved GG(A)G halfway through the sequence motif and the fifth residue of a more N-terminal hexad (13Holden H.M. Benning M.M. Haller T. Gerlt J.A. Acc. Chem. Res. 2001; 34: 145-157Google Scholar). The crotonase superfamily has thus served as a useful paradigm for illustrating the mechanisms of divergent evolution of enzyme action through the recruitment of the crotonase (enoyl-CoA hydratase) fold for alternate reaction chemistry. It was clear from the sequencing results that OCH represented a further diverged member of the crotonase superfamily; not only was the natural substrate not an acyl coenzyme A thioester but the distinctive GG(A)G motif for oxyanion stabilization was not present, being replaced instead by an NHP sequence (7Grogan G. Roberts G.A. Bougioukou D. Turner N.J. Flitsch S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12565-12572Google Scholar).The divergence of OCH from the parent crotonase, enoyl-CoA hydratase (ECH) (8Engel C.K. Mathieu M. Zeelen J.P. Hiltunen J.K. Wierenga R.K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5135-5145Google Scholar), was further emphasized by comparison of the enzyme structures (14Whittingham J.L. Turkenburg J.P. Verma C.S. Walsh M.A. Grogan G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1744-1750Google Scholar). While retaining the overall quaternary arrangement of enoyl-CoA hydratase, the tertiary fold of the poorly sequence-conserved C-terminal helix of OCH appeared to assume a different motif, curling around the β-α-β-superhelix of the N-terminal portion in contrast to forming a second discrete domain as observed in ECH and some other crotonase superfamily structures such as 4-chlorobenzoyl dehalogenase (10Benning M.M. Taylor K.L. Liu R-Q. Yang G. Xiang H. Wesenberg G. Dunaway-Mariano D. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8103-8109Google Scholar). This stark difference in tertiary structure was also observed for methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase (9Benning M.M. Haller T. Gerlt J.A. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4630-4639Google Scholar) from Escherichia coli and yeast Δ3-Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase of the crotonase superfamily (15Mursula A.M. van Aalten D.M.F. Kalervo Hiltunen J. Wierenga R.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 845-853Google Scholar). At that stage, despite repeated co-crystallization experiments with the natural substrate, we were not able to acquire a structure of OCH with either its natural substrate or product bound. However, a large cavity in the enzyme, completed by the recruitment of the C-terminal helical domain, was identified as a possible active site based on the protrusion of a number of acid-base amino acid residues into its center. Using the known prochiral selectivity of OCH, we were able to model both the substrate 6-oxo camphor and major diastereomeric product (2R,4S)-α-campholinic acid into the putative active site and to intimate a putative mechanistic role for the acid-base residues His-45, His-122, His-145, Asp-154, and Glu-244.In this study, we report the kinetic analysis of mutants H45A, H122A, H145A, D154N, and E244Q of OCH and describe rational use of the low kcat plus low Km mutant H122A for the acquisition of a 1.9-Å crystal structure of OCH H122A bound to the minor diastereoisomer of the reaction product, (2S,4S)-α-campholinic acid. The kinetic data, in conjunction with the mutant crystal structure, support a possible mechanistic role for a His-145/Asp-154 dyad in a general base-catalyzed mechanism and also illuminate the important roles of Trp-40 and Phe-82 in substrate recognition and determination of prochiral selectivity. The cumulative data are also suggestive of an atypical mode of transition state binding for a crotonase homolog, which would by definition place OCH and more closely related gene products in an enzyme family distinct from other crotonases hitherto described.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals—All chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise specified. 6-oxo camphor was obtained as detailed in Ref. 7Grogan G. Roberts G.A. Bougioukou D. Turner N.J. Flitsch S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12565-12572Google Scholar. Plasmid pET-26b(+) was obtained from Novagen Ltd. Primers for mutagenesis of camK were obtained from MWG Biotech.Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Culture Conditions—Wild-type and mutant OCH genes were expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3). The plasmid pGG3 had been obtained previously by ligating the camK gene into pET-26b(+) plasmid (14Whittingham J.L. Turkenburg J.P. Verma C.S. Walsh M.A. Grogan G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1744-1750Google Scholar). E. coli was cultured in Luria Bertani broth with 30 μg ml–1 kanamycin at 37 °C. Cultures were routinely grown to an optical density of A600 = 0.6, induced for expression of wild-type or mutant OCH by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and then grown for a further 3 h at 37 °C.Site-directed Mutagenesis of OCH—The H45A, H122A, H145A, D154N, and E244Q mutants were constructed using the QuikChange® mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with the pGG3 plasmid as a template. The primers used to create the mutants were 5′-GTGTGGACCTCAACCGCAGCCGACGAGCTGGCCTACTG-3′ and 5′-CAGTAGGCCAGCTCGTCGGCTGCGGTTGAGGTCCACAC-3′ for H45A, 5′-CAACGGACCGGTGACCAACGCCCCGGAGATCCCCGTCATG-3′ and 5′-CATGACGGGGATCTCCGGGGCGTTGGTCACCGGTCCGTTG-3′ for H122A, 5′-CACCTTCCAGGACGGACCGGCCTTCCCTTCCGGCATCGTG-3′ and 5′-CACGATGCCGGAAGGGAAGGCCGGTCCGTCCTGGAAGGTG-3′ for H145A, 5′-CCGGCATCGTGCCCGGGAACGGCGCCCACGTGGTG-3′ and 5′-CACCACGTGGGCGCCGTTCCCGGGCACGATGCCGG-3′ for D154N, and 5′-GTCTCGGCCTCGCGCACCAAGCGCTCGCCGCCATC-3′ and 5′-GATGGCGGCGAGCGCTTGGTGCGCGAGGCCGAGAC-3′ for E244Q. The following parameters were used during thermal cycling: 1 cycle of 99 °C for 30 s, followed by 20 cycles of 99 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 60 s, and 68 °C for 840 s. Mutant plasmids were purified using standard methods and sequenced to confirm the presence of the substituted bases.Purification and Assay of OCH Mutants—All five mutant genes were expressed and purified using an identical protocol as detailed in Ref. 7Grogan G. Roberts G.A. Bougioukou D. Turner N.J. Flitsch S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12565-12572Google Scholar. Levels of soluble OCH mutant proteins were obtained with comparable yield and solubility to the wild-type. The activity of the OCH mutants was evaluated as described previously (7Grogan G. Roberts G.A. Bougioukou D. Turner N.J. Flitsch S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12565-12572Google Scholar) by measuring the decrease in absorption at 294 nm over time, indicating the rate of cleavage of the 6-oxo camphor substrate by enzyme. It was possible to construct Michaelis-Menten plots for each mutant by measuring the initial rate of catalysis over a range of substrate concentrations. Lineweaver-Burk plots were used to obtain the Km and kcat for the natural substrate for each mutant enzyme.Crystallization of the H122A Mutant—Crystals of the H122A mutant of OCH were grown by the vapor diffusion hanging drop technique. A 10 mg/ml protein solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.1, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was mixed in a 50:50 ratio with reservoir to form the hanging drops. The reservoir solution consisted of 0.1 m 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid, pH 5.6, 0.2 m calcium acetate, and 26% (v/v) polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether, 2,000 Da. Prior to data collection, crystals were transferred to a saturated solution of 6-oxo camphor in reservoir and soaked for 30 min. The H122A mutant crystallized in space group P21, with cell dimensions a = 83.27 Å, b = 132.00 Å, c = 135.43 Å, β = 94.115°.Data Collection and Data Processing—A data set extending to 1.9-Å resolution was collected on a single crystal of the H122A mutant enzyme that had been flash frozen at 120 K using the soak solution, which acted as a cryoprotectant because of the presence of polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether, 2,000 Da. The data were collected on beamline ID14-EH3 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France, using a MAR165 CCD detector. The data were processed, scaled, and merged using the HKL suite (16Otwinowski Z. Minor V. Carter C.W. Sweet R.M. Macromolecular Crystallography, Part A. 276.

A. 1994; 50: 157-163Google Scholar), starting with a model from the 2-Å resolution structure of OCH (Protein Data Bank entry 1o8u). The OCH hexamer was used as a search model with all water atoms removed. The resulting H122A model contained 12 monomers in the asymmetric unit corresponding to 2 hexamers. Following molecular replacement, initial refinement was performed using the CCP4 (17Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Google Scholar) program REFMAC5 (19Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Google Scholar). Rigid body refinement was performed for 10 cycles. The model was then subjected to positional refinement and initial maximum likelihood weighted 2 Fo – Fc and Fo – Fc maps were calculated. The model was adjusted to fit the electron density maps using the XTALVIEW molecular graphics program (20McRee D.E. J. Mol. Graph. 1992; 10: 44-46Google Scholar). Electron density was present in both maps corresponding to the bound product of catalysis, (2S,4S)-α-campholinic acid. The CCP4 (17Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Google Scholar) program SKETCHER was used to make the product molecule model; a library file was created for use in REFMAC5 (19Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Google Scholar) using the CCP4 (17Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Google Scholar) program LIBCHECK. This was built into each of the 12 sites in the asymmetric unit. Further positional refinement was performed with non-crystallographic symmetry restraints applied between all 12 monomers, and the model was adjusted again. The water structure was built into the model using the CCP4 (17Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystogr. Sect. D Biol.

Crystallogr. 1993; 49: 129-147Google Scholar), followed by more rounds of positional refinement. During the refinement process, 5% of the data were randomly selected and excluded from refinement for Rfree cross-validation. The refinement statistics of the final model are given in Table I.Accession Number—The coordinates for the structure of the H122A mutant of OCH have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank under the designation 1szo.RESULTSKinetic Analysis of OCH Mutants—The 2-Å structure of OCH and subsequent modeling studies (14Whittingham J.L. Turkenburg J.P. Verma C.S. Walsh M.A. Grogan G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1744-1750Google Scholar) were suggestive of mechanistic roles for His-45, His-122, His-145, Asp-154, and Glu-244. On an essentially intuitive basis, therefore, site-directed mutants H45A, H122A, H145A, D154N, and E244Q of OCH were chosen for study and prepared using the Stratagene QuikChange® kit. Kinetic analysis of the mutants was carried out using the established UV spectrophotometric assay for OCH based on the disappearance of the native substrate, 6-oxo camphor, at 294 nm. The results are shown in Table II. Each mutant shows a reduced kcat, but this effect is most noticeable for the H145A and H122A mutants. The H45A, H122A, and E244Q mutants display a Km for the native substrate comparable with that of the wild-type enzyme, whereas the H145A and D154N mutants display an approximate 100-fold increase. In terms of catalytic efficiency, the kinetic constants for H145A contribute to the most reduced second order rate constant (kcat/Km) for any of the mutants, a factor ∼106 lower than the wild-type. The second order rate constants for reactions catalyzed by E244Q and H45A suggest that these residues have a less significant overall effect on catalysis than the other three mutated residues.Table IIKinetic parameters for wild-type (recombinant) and mutant 6-oxo camphor hydrolasesEnzymekcatKmkcat/Kms-1mm-1 s-1Wild-type OCH642.860.041.61 × 107H45A1.140.019.50 × 104H122A0.360.201.80 × 103H145A0.283.338.40 × 101D154N1.424.013.55 × 102E244Q20.400.082.55 × 105 Open table in a new tab Overall Structure of the H122A Mutant-Product Complex— The crystal structure of the H122A mutant complexed with (2S,4S)-α-campholinic acid was determined to 1.9-Å resolution. The structure (Fig. 2) revealed that the location of the active site had been correctly identified in our previous publication (14Whittingham J.L. Turkenburg J.P. Verma C.S. Walsh M.A. Grogan G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1744-1750Google Scholar), bound on one side by helices α-2, α-3, and α-9, the last of these being the C-terminal helix. The quality of the final model was analyzed using the CCP4 (17Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Google Scholar) program PROCHECK (22Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Google Scholar). The Ramachandran plot shows that 95.3% of residues occupy the most favored regions, with a further 4.2% occupying additional allowed regions. Only residue His-145 adopts dihedral angles significantly outside the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. His-145 is located within a type I β-turn immediately preceding a 310 helix, between strand 8 and helix α-5, and the electron density of this residue is unambiguous.Fig. 2Stereoview close-up of the active site of the H122A mutant of OCH with bound (2S,4S)-α-campholinic acid and selected side chain residues shown in ball-and-stick representation, with electron density from the final maximum likelihood weighted 2 Fo – Fc map to 1.9 Å and calculated contoured at 1 σ also shown. Side chain residues are labeled. The active site is located between helices α-2, α-3, and α-9, shown as ribbons in silver. This figure and Figs. 3 and 4 were generated with the programs MOLSCRIPT (28Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Google Scholar), BOBSCRIPT (29Esnouf R.M. J. Mol.

Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 869-873Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The H122A mutant forms a hexamer, which can be described as a dimer of trimers, identical to that of the wild-type enzyme (14Whittingham J.L. Turkenburg J.P. Verma C.S. Walsh M.A. Grogan G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1744-1750Google Scholar). The α-carbons of the mutant hexamer superimpose on those of the wild-type hexamer with a root mean square displacement of 0.38 Å and a maximum displacement of 2.50 Å, calculated using the CCP4 program LSQKAB (23Kabsch W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1976; 32: 922-923Google Scholar). The differences between the two structures can be attributed to the presence of the bound product molecule in the active site (Fig. 3). There are three regions of change with respect to the wild-type structure upon binding of the product molecule, defined by Glu-76 → Asn-83, Pro-118 → Glu-124, and Gln-141 → Ile-150. The first region contains a 310 helix and is positioned just before helix α-3. The region contains two phenylalanines, the first of which, Phe-79, appears to move to close off the entrance to the active site as suggested previously (14Whittingham J.L. Turkenburg J.P. Verma C.S. Walsh M.A. Grogan G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1744-1750Google Scholar). The second phenylalanine, Phe-82, facilitates this movement by forming a stacking interaction between the plane of its aromatic ring and the pro-(R) face of the cyclopentane ring of the product, suggesting a mechanism whereby the entrance to the active site is closed during catalysis by direct interaction with the substrate. The second region is positioned after helix α-3 and strand 6 and contains a type IV β-turn. The mutated residue Ala-122 is contained within this region, and the movement may reflect its role in catalysis, but it may also be an artifact of the mutation. The final region contains a type I β-turn followed by a 310 helix. This region contains His-145, which hydrogen bonds at a distance of 2.77 Å to one of the carboxylate oxygens of the pendant acetate at C-4 of the bound product.Fig. 3Stereoview of superimposition of native OCH wild-type structure and H122A mutant in the active site region, showing movement of three labeled secondary structural motifs on ligand binding. The wild-type structure, including side chains, is shown in silver. All side chains are shown in all-bonds representation with selected side chains labeled.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The density of the bound ligand in each of the 12 subunits in the model is unambiguous, as illustrated in Fig. 2. The ligand observed is not the major product of carbon-carbon bond cleavage observed with the wild-type enzyme, which exhibits the cis-stereochemistry of the 2-methyl and 4-acetate groups as confirmed by x-ray crystallography of the enzymatic product generated in vitro (2Grogan G. Graf J. Jones A. Parsons S. Turner N.J. Flitsch S.L. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2001; 40: 1111-1114Google Scholar), but rather the (2S,4S)-diastereomer of the trans conformation. The structure provides useful information on important active site interactions between the product molecule and the active site. In addition, the product is bound in a closed conformation, with the structure giving the impression of the substrate molecule just after carbon-carbon bond cleavage, and retains the three-dimensional character of the substrate.In addition to those already described, further interactions are apparent between active site residue side chains and the product (Fig. 4). The endocyclic carbonyl of the product is hydrogen bonded at a distance of 2.56 Å to the N-H group of Trp-40. The carboxylate oxygen of the pendant acetate at C4 that hydrogen bonds to His-145 also hydrogen bonds to Glu-244 at a distance of 2.50 Å. The other carboxylate oxygen of the acetate hydrogen bonds with Asp-154 at a distance of 2.67 Å.It is possible that His-145 and Asp-154 form a catalytic dyad. There may also be an indirect interaction between this carboxylate oxygen and His-45 via an active site water that is hydrogen bonded to both the carboxylate oxygen at a distance of 2.76 Å and His-45 at a distance of 2.72 Å. Another active site water hydrogen bonds the first water at a distance of 2.72 Å and also the backbone carbonyls of Asp-154 and Gly-97 at distances of 2.66 and 2.90 Å, respectively. Finally, the geminal dimethyl group of the product is situated in a hydrophobic cleft formed by Leu-84, Ile-150, and Phe-82, making hydrophobic contacts at distances of 4.04, 4.12, and 3.59 Å, respectively. All three residues are in regions of change one and three with respect to the wild-type structure described above and appear to move closer upon ligand binding.Fig. 4Stereoview of active site of OCH H122A mutant showing hydrogen bonding interactions of product (2S,4S)-α-campholinic acid, with active site residue side chains and water molecules shown in ball-and-stick representation. Side chains and hydrogen bond distances (Å) are labeled.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Superimposition of the ligand-bound mutant and wild-type structure also reveal water molecules in the native structure in place of the endocyclic carbonyl of the product and the oxygen atoms of the pendant C4 acetate. This is perhaps suggestive of water activation by either Asp-154 or His-145 in a general base-catalyzed mechanism as discussed below.DISCUSSIONA variety of mechanisms have evolved in nature for the cleavage of β-diketone molecules between the two carbonyl groups. Pentane 2,4-dione (acetylacetone) is cleaved by a serine hydrolase-type enzyme from Pseudomonas to yield acetate and acetone (5Shimao M. Tamogami T. Kishida S. Harayama S. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 649-657Google Scholar) and can also be cleaved oxidatively by the enzyme Dke1 from Acinetobacter johnsonii to yield methylglyoxal and acetate (6Straganz G. Brecker L. Weber H.J. Steiner W. Ribbons D.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 297: 232-236Google Scholar). Mechanistic investigations of these enzymes are complicated by the existence of the substrate in both diketo and enolate forms in solution. In contrast, all the substrates shown to be cleaved by 6-oxo camphor hydrolase thus far are non-enolizable, either as a result of quaternary substitution at the carbon center between the carbonyl groups or because of restrictions imposed by Bredt's rule in the bicyclic systems. From the results described above, it appears that in the case of these non-enolizable ketones, further enzyme chemistry using amino acids recruited from the crotonase fold has been adopted for β-diketone cleavage, and indeed a previously unreported mechanism of carbon-carbon bond cleavage appears to operate.Although OCH is unique among the crotonase superfamily in that it does not act on an acyl-CoA thioester, the retro-Dieckmann reaction catalyzed is reminiscent of the carbon-carbon bond cleavage catalyzed by the crotonase homolog BadI from Rhodopseudomonas palustris (24Pelletier D.A.

To understand the relationship between structure and substrate specificity, x-ray structures of a TVAII-acarbose complex and inactive mutant TVAII (D325N/D421N)/α-, β- and γ-CDs complexes were determined at resolutions of 2.9, 2.9, 2.8, and 3.1 Å, respectively. In all complexes, the interactions between ligands and enzymes at subsites –1, –2, and –3 were almost the same, but striking differences in the catalytic site structure were found at subsites +1 and +2, where Trp356 and Tyr374 changed the conformation of the side chain depending on the structure and size of the ligands. Trp356 and Tyr374 are thought to be responsible for the multiple substrate-recognition mechanism of TVAII, providing the unique substrate specificity.

Cyclomalto-oligosaccharides (cyclodextrins, CDs) 1The abbreviations used are: CD, cyclodextrin; TVAII, T. vulgaris R-47 α-amylase 2; D325N/D421N, mutant TVAII (Asp325→ Asn/Asp421→ Asn); MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; Cyt, cyclitol. are cyclic oligosaccharides with six (α-), seven (β-), or eight (γ-) glucose units, having a rigid conical structure.

Kim T.-J. Cheong T.-K. Kim J.-W. Oh B.-H. Svensson B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1478: 165-185Google Scholar). To investigate this property of TVAII, we report the x-ray structures of TVAII (3Kamitori S. Abe A. Ohtaki A. Kaji A. Tonozuka T. Sakano Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 443-453Google Scholar, 4Kamitori S. Kondo S. Okuyama K. Yokota T. Shimura Y. Tonozuka T. Sakano Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 907-921Google Scholar), an inactive mutant TVAII complex with β-CD (5Kondo S. Ohtaki A. Tonozuka T. Sakano Y. Kamitori S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 129: 423-428Google Scholar) and kinetic analysis of mutant TVAII (6Ohtaki A. Kondo S. Shimura Y. Tonozuka T. Sakano Y. Kamitori S. Carbohydr. Res. 2001; 334: 309-313Google Scholar), giving new insight into the recognition mechanism of β-CD. Also, the x-ray structures of Thermus. sp. IM6501 maltogenic α-amylase (7Kim J.-S. Cha S.-S. Kim H.-J. Kim T.-J. Ha N.-C. Oh S.-T. Cho H.-S. Cho M.-J. Kim M.-J. Lee H.-S. Kim J.-W. Choi K.-Y. Park K.-H. Oh B.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26279-26286Google Scholar), Bacillus stearothermophilus Neopullulanase (8Hondoh H. Kuriki T. Matsuura Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 177-188Google Scholar), and Flavobacterium cyclomaltodextrinase (9Fritzsche H.B. Schwede T. Schulz G.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2332-2341Google Scholar), which can hydrolyze CDs as well as TVAII, have been reported. These x-ray structures showed that all of them have an additional domain with a distorted β-barrel structure to three α-amylase-conserved domains (10Berman H.M. Westbook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shendyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Google Scholar). Therefore, the identity of these enzyme subclasses has been proposed (11Lee H.-S. Kim M.-S. Cho H.-S. Kim J.-I. Kim T.-J. Choi J.-H. Park C. Lee H.-S. Oh B.-H. Park K.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21891-21897Google Scholar). The substrate-hydrolyzing mechanisms of α-amylase family enzymes have been extensively studied from various aspects (12Sinnot M.L. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1171-1202Google Scholar, 13McCarter J.D. Withers S.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 885-892Google Scholar). However, the proposed mechanisms are based on the complex structures between α-amylase and substrates/inhibitors with a linear structure like maltopentaose/acarbose, and they are inadequate for CDs with a cyclic structure. Thus, the CD-hydrolyzing mechanisms are still unclear in the above-mentioned enzymes including TVAII. To obtain new insights into the CD-hydrolyzing mechanism of TVAII, we report here the x-ray structures of the TVAII-acarbose complex, and complexes of the inactive mutant TVAII (Asp325 → Asn325/Asp421 →Asn 421; D325N/D421N) with α-CD, β-CD, and γ-CD at a resolution of 2.9, 2.9, 2.8, and 3.1 Å, respectively. D325N/D421N/α-, γ-CD are the first x-ray structures of complexes between α-amylase and α-, γ-CDs as substrates. Site-directed Mutagenesis and Purification of the Enzyme—The inactive mutant TVAII, D325N/D421N, was prepared from recombinant Escherichia coli MV1184 cells. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the plasmid pTNKK (14Tonozuka T. Ohtsuka M. Mogi S. Sakai H. Ohta T. Sakano Y. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1993; 57: 395-401Google Scholar) with the QuickChange kit (Stratagene) for construction of mutant TVAII (D421N), in which Asp421 was replaced by Asn (15Ichikawa K. Tonozuka T. Yokota T. Shimura Y. Sakano Y. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2000; 64: 2692-2695Google Scholar). Because D421N still has hydrolyzing activity for CD, a double mutant D325N/D421N was prepared using the plasmid D421N as a template. The purification of this inactive mutant D325N/D421N was performed in the same way as the wild-type TVAII (4Kamitori S. Kondo S. Okuyama K. Yokota T. Shimura Y. Tonozuka T. Sakano Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 907-921Google Scholar). X-ray Structural Analysis—The purification procedure and crystallization conditions of D325N/D421N were almost the same as those of wild-type TVAII, as reported previously (4Kamitori S. Kondo S. Okuyama K. Yokota T. Shimura Y. Tonozuka T. Sakano Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 907-921Google Scholar). The crystals were grown by a vapor diffusion hanging drop method at 20 °C by using a protein solution (15 mg/ml) and a reservoir solution containing 0.5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 20,000 and 2.5 mm calcium chloride in 20 mm MES buffer (pH 6.2). A crystal of TVAII-acarbose complex was obtained by a soaking method using the reservoir solution containing 1 mm acarbose; soaking time was 1 h. Acarbose was kindly provided by Bayer Yakuhin (Japan). Crystals of D325N/D421N/α-CD and D325N/D421N/β-CD were also obtained by a soaking method by using reservoir solution containing 30 mm of α-CD and 20 mm of β-CD. A crystal of D325N/D421N/γ-CD was obtained by a co-crystallization method, using a protein solution containing 30 mm of γ-CD. X-ray diffraction data for TVAII/acarbose and D325N/D421N/β-CD were collected at 100 K using an ADSC/CCD detector system on the BL6A beam line in the Photon Factory (Tukuba, Japan), and data for D325N/D421N/α-CD and D325N/D421N/γ-CD were collected at 100 K using an MacScience/DIP2040 imaging plate detector system on the BL44XU beam line in Spring-8 (Hyogo, Japan), using a reservoir solution containing 20% (w/v) 2-methyl-2,4-pentadiol as a cryoprotected solution. Diffraction data were processed using the program MOSFLM (16Leslie A.G.W. Moras D. Podjarny A.D. Thierry J.C. Crystallographic Computing V. Oxford University Press, Oxford1991: 27-38Google Scholar) and SCALA in the CCP4 program suite (17Project Collaborative Computational Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Google Scholar). The collected data and scaling results are listed in Table I. Initial phases were determined by a molecular replacement method using the structure of TVAII (3Kamitori S. Abe A. Ohtaki A. Kaji A. Tonozuka T. Sakano Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 443-453Google Scholar, 4Kamitori S. Kondo S. Okuyama K. Yokota T. Shimura Y. Tonozuka T. Sakano Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 907-921Google Scholar) as a probe model with the program CNS (18Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar). Models were corrected on the (2Fo – Fc) electron density map using the program Xfit in the XtalView system (19McRee D.E. J. Mol. Graph. 1992; 10: 44-47Google Scholar), and structures without solvent molecules were refined using maximum resolution data. Calculations of structural refinements were carried out by the program CNS. Solvent molecules were gradually introduced if peaks above 4.0 σ in the (Fo – Fc) electron density map were in the range of a hydrogen bond. To avoid over fitting of diffraction data, a free R-factor with 10% of the test set excluded from the refinement was monitored (20Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Google Scholar). Refinement statistics are listed in Table I. In a Ramachandran plot, 83.4% (acarbose), 81.7% (α-CD), 81.3% (β-CD), and 79.1% (γ-CD) of residues are shown in the most favored regions as determined by the program PROCHECK (21Ramachandran G.N. Sasisekharan V. Adv. Protein Chem. 1968; 23: 283-437Google Scholar, 22Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Google Scholar), and no residue is in the disallowed regions.Table IData collection and refinement statisticsData set (complex with)Acarboseα-CDβ-CDγ-CDTemperature (K)100100100100Resolution (Å)2.92.92.83.1No. measured references184,36889,750174,58768,436No. unique references34,43132,49738,61226,454Completeness (%)99.593.399.893.7RmergeaRmerge = ΣΣ|Ii — 〈I〉/Σ〈I〉.

Open table in a new tab The coordinates and structure factors of the acarbose, α-, β-, and γ-CDs complexes were deposited in the Protein Data Bank (10Berman H.M. Westbook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shendyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Google Scholar) under the accession codes 1VFK, 1VFM, 1VFO, and 1VFU, respectively. Overall Structures of Complexes with Acarbose, α-, β-, and γ-CDs—TVAII is composed of four domains as follows: domain N (residues 1–121) with a distorted β-barrel structure; domain A (residues 122–242 and 298–502) with a (β/α)8 barrel structure; domain B (residues 243–297) protruding from domain A; and domain C (residues 503–585) with a β-sandwich structure. TVAII forms a dimer structure of two molecules, denoted as Mol-1 and Mol-2, with a 2-fold symmetry. Domain N mainly contributes to the molecular surface between Mol-1 and Mol-2, as shown in Fig. 1 (23Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Google Scholar). In a dimer there are two catalytic sites, formed mainly by the residues from domain A and domain B and partially by domain N of another molecule. In all complex structures, the electron densities of ligands are clearly identified at the catalytic site of Mol-1, but those at the catalytic site of Mol-2 are relatively ambiguous compared with Mol-1. This is because a symmetric molecule partially covers the catalytic site of Mol-2 in the crystalline state, leading to relatively low occupancies for the binding ligands. Therefore, the structural description here concentrates on the catalytic site of Mol-1. The structural models of acarbose and three CDs on Fo – Fc omit maps with the 4 σ contoured level at the catalytic sites in Mol-1 are shown in Fig. 2 (24McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Google Scholar). Acarbose is a tetrasaccharide, cyclitol-α-(1,4)-6-deoxyglucose-α-(1,4)-Glc-α-(1,4)-Glc, but the electron density strongly showed a binding oligosaccharide composed of five saccharide units, Glc-α-(1,4)-Glc-α-(1,4)-cyclitol-α-(1,4)-6-deoxyglucose-α-(1,4)-Glc. This is because TVAII has activity for both hydrolysis and transglycosylation, and the transglycosylation of acarbose is frequently found in acarbose complexes of the glycoside hydrolase family 13 (25Ramasubbu N. Ragunath C. Mishra P.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 1061-1076Google Scholar, 26Strokopytov B. Penninga D. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Dijkhuizen L. Dijkstra B.W.

Kamitori S. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 811-822Google Scholar). For discussion, saccharide units of acarbose are designated Glc–3, Glc–2, Cyt–1, Glc+1, and Glc+2 from the nonreducing to reducing end. The numbers in parentheses in Fig. 2 indicate the subsite. The catalytic site is between subsites –1 and +1. In the α-CD (Fig. 1b), β-CD (Fig. 2c), and γ-CD (Fig. 2d) complexes, saccharide units are designed in the same manner as shown in Fig. 2.Fig. 2The simulated annealed omit maps with structural models of binding acarbose (a), α-CD (b), β-CD (c), and γ-CD (d). The contour level of these maps is 4.0 σ, illustrated by the program Xfit (24McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Acarbose Binding to the Catalytic Site—Fig. 3a shows the interaction between TVAII and acarbose. The torsion angles of glycoside bonds of acarbose at the hydrolyzing site, φ (O-5—C-1—N-4′—C-4′) = 32° and ψ (C-1—N-4′—C-4′—C-5′) = –151°, are largely deviated from those of the regular helical structure of amylose, φ = 104° and ψ = –121° (31Imberty A. Chanzy H. Perez S. Buleon A. Tran V. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 201: 365-378Google Scholar). The cyclitol unit binding to subsite –1 adopts a half-chair conformation, which is a mimic of the transition state. Three catalytic residues, Asp325, Glu354, and Asp421, which are strictly conserved in α-amylases, make many hydrogen bonds with Glc+1 and Cyt–1 at the hydrolyzing site. The O-ϵ1 atom of Glu354 forms a hydrogen bond with the N-4 atom between Cyt–1 and Glc+1. The O-δ1 atom of Asp325 forms hydrogen bonds with the O-6 atom of Cyt–1, causing the O-δ2 atom to be in direct contact with the C-1 atom of cyclitol with a distance of 2.9 Å. The O-δ1 and O-δ2 atoms of Asp421 form hydrogen bonds with the O-3 and O-2 atoms of Cyt–1 to fix its orientation. Additional hydrogen bonds were made between Arg469 and Glc–2. Three planar residues nicely make stacking interactions with saccharide units; they are Trp356 with Glc+2, Tyr204 with Glc–1, and His202 with Glc–2. The stacking interaction by Trp356 was induced by acarbose binding, because Trp356 in unliganded TVAII adopts a different side chain conformation, as shown in Fig. 3a. Phe286, Val326, and Tyr45* make van der Waals contacts with the acarbose at the opposite side of the three catalytic residues, helping to fix the substrate in a proper position. Interactions between acarbose and the enzyme found in this study are very similar to those in other α-amylase-acarbose complex structures (25Ramasubbu N. Ragunath C. Mishra P.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 1061-1076Google Scholar, 26Strokopytov B. Penninga D. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Dijkhuizen L. Dijkstra B.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2234-2240Google Scholar, 27Machius M. Vertesy L.

The selected hydrogen bonds are shown with dotted lines.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Cyclodextrin Binding to the Catalytic Site—The saccharide units in the binding α-CD occupy six subsites, –3 to +3 (Fig. 3b), with a distorted structure at the hydrolyzing site between subsites –1 and +1 (φ = 36° and ψ = –143°), as found in the TVAII/acarbose. At sibsites –3, –2, –1, and +1, the conformation of saccharide units and interactions between saccharide units and the enzyme are similar to those found in TVAII/acarbose. Also, three catalytic residues, Asn325, Glu354, and Asn421, make hydrogen bonds with α-CD in a similar manner to acarbose, despite the replacement of amino acids (Asn325 from Asp and Asn421 from Asp). However, because of the cyclic structure of α-CD, interactions between α-CD and the enzyme at + subsites are different from those in TVAII/acarbose. Glc+2 does not make stacking interactions with Trp356 as found in TVAII/acarbose, because of the different locations of Glc+2 from that of acarbose. If Trp356 adopts the same side chain conformation as found in TVAII/acarbose, unusual short contacts between Trp356 and Glc+2 occur. The O-6 atom of Glc+2 forms a hydrogen bond with Arg44*, and Glc+2 and Glc+3 make van der Waals contacts with Tyr45*, showing that residues from domain N are very important to recognize Glc+2 and Glc+3 of α-CD. The saccharide units in the binding β-CD occupy seven subsites, –3 to +4 (Fig. 3c). Most interesting, the β-CD retains regular conical shape, different from TVAII/acarbose and D325N/D421N/α-CD. The glycoside linkage at the hydrolyzing site is not changed (φ = 119° and ψ = –116°). Such a regular conical structure of β-CD is also found in β-CD complex structures with other α-amylase family enzymes (5Kondo S. Ohtaki A. Tonozuka T. Sakano Y. Kamitori S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 129: 423-428Google Scholar, 11Lee H.-S. Kim M.-S. Cho H.-S. Kim J.-I. Kim T.-J. Choi J.-H. Park C. Lee H.-S. Oh B.-H. Park K.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21891-21897Google Scholar, 32Schmidt A.K. Cottaz S. Driguez H. Schulz G.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5909-5915Google Scholar). Glc–1, Glc–2, and Glc–3 interact with the enzyme in a similar manner to that found in TVAII/acarbose and D325N/D421N/α-CD, but unique locations of Glc+1, Glc+2, and Glc+3 give structural change to the catalytic site. Glu354 forms a hydrogen bond not with the O-4 atoms but with the O-3 atoms of Glc+1, because the lone pair of electrons for the O-4 atoms of Glc+1 moves to an opposite side to Glu354 because of the regular conical structure of β-CD. The conformational change of Trp356 was induced to make a stacking interaction with Glc+2, but it occurs in a different manner from the acarbose complex. Glc+3 makes van der Waals contacts with Tyr45*, and Glc+4 shows no efficient interaction with the catalytic site residues. The electron density of the binding γ-CD also shows a conical structure of γ-CD (Fig. 2d), but it is significantly bent at glucoside linkages of Glc–1–Glc+1 and Glc+4–Glc–4, with the angle of 36°, giving the intermediate conformation of Glc+1 between those of the binding α- and β-CDs. Glc–3, Glc–2, and Glc–1 adopt a similar structure to other complexes, and interactions of them with the enzyme are also almost conserved. Although the electron density of saccharide units at + subsites of γ-CD is not enough to determine the precise conformations as shown in Fig. 2d, the quality of electron density for catalytic site residues allows us to deduce the interactions between γ-CD and the enzymes. Trp356 adopts a completely different conformation from those in other complex structures to avoid steric hindrance with γ-CD. It makes van der Waals contacts with O-2 and O-3 atoms of Glc+1 and Glc+2, giving a bent structure to γ-CD. Ala44* and Arg46* possibly make hydrogen bonds with Glc+3 and Glc+2, respectively. Glc+4 and Glc–4 make no direct interactions with the catalytic site residues. Induced Fit Movement of Main Chain by Ligand Binding— Through ligand binding, the induced fit movements were observed at the catalytic site. Fig. 4 shows the superimposed catalytic site structures of unliganded TVAII (white), TVAII/acarbose (black), and D325N/D421N/β-CD (gray) complexes. Three regions of the catalytic site significantly move through the ligand binding; they are the loops of 198–205 and 283–293 from Mol-1 and 42*–50* from Mol-2. When ligands bind to the catalytic site, the loop of 198–205 moves close to the ligand to make a stacking interaction between His202 and Glc–2. The movements of this region are almost equivalent between acarbose and CD complexes. The loops of 283–293 and 42*–50* recognize the ligands at the opposite side of loop 198–205, and the movements of these loops vary depending on the ligands. In acarbose binding, the loop of 42*–50* largely moves to make a favorable contact between Tyr45* and Glc+1, whereas in α-, β-, and γ-CD bindings, Tyr45* makes a favorable contact not with Glc+1 but with Glc+2, giving a small movement of this loop. Because Phe286 and Tyr45* are important residues for recognizing the hydrophobic cavities of CDs (5Kondo S. Ohtaki A. Tonozuka T. Sakano Y. Kamitori S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 129: 423-428Google Scholar, 6Ohtaki A. Kondo S. Shimura Y. Tonozuka T. Sakano Y. Kamitori S. Carbohydr. Res. 2001; 334: 309-313Google Scholar), these regions need to move flexibly to make favorable interactions with various sized ligands. The relatively high temperature factors of these loops suggest that these loops are inherently flexible and dynamically moving through the ligand binding. Multiple Substrate Recognition Mechanism of TVAII—In all complexes, the relative positions and orientations of saccharide units at subsites –1, –2, and –3 to the enzymes are almost the same, and the interactions of these saccharide units with the enzymes are equivalent to others. Striking differences in the catalytic site structures are found at + subsites, especially the side chain conformations of Trp356 and Tyr374. In unliganded TVAII, the side chain conformations of these residues are κ1 (N-CA-CB-CG) = –55°, κ2 (CA-CB-CG-CD1) = 134° for Trp356, and κ1 = 73° and κ2 = 95° for Tyr374, and there is no stacking interaction between Trp356 and Tyr374, as shown in Fig. 3. The acarbose binding causes a drastic change in the side chain conformations of Trp356 to make a strong stacking interaction with Glc+2. This stacking interaction is reinforced by the stacking interaction with Tyr374, whose side chain conformations also change with the acarbose binding. The conformational changes of Trp356 and Tyr374 are expected to play an important role in stabilizing the ligand conformation for the catalytic reaction. In the α-CD complex, significant conformational changes of Trp356 and Tyr374 are not observed, and they are almost the same as those of unliganded TVAII (κ1 = –52° and κ2 = 140° for Trp356, and κ1 = 69° and κ2 = 106° for Tyr374). When α-CD with a conical structure approaches the catalytic site of TVAII, the N-ϵ and C-δ1 atoms of Trp356 should first make contact with Glc+1 of α-CD, and possibly distort the conical structure of α-CD by pushing Glc+1 from the inside of the cavity like a wedge, giving the same conformation of the glycoside linkage between Glc–1 and Glc+1 as that of acarbose. Because Trp356 cannot form a stacking interaction with Glc+2 because of the cyclic structure of α-CD, Trp356 and Tyr374 maintain their inherent conformations, fixing the glucose linkage suitable for the catalytic reaction. Therefore, the inherent conformations of Trp356 found in unliganded TVAII are thought to be important to change the glycoside linkage at the hydrolyzing site of α-CD. In the β-CD complex, Trp356 rotates its side chain (κ1 = –159° and κ2 = 55°) to make a nicely stacking interaction with Glc+2 from the outside of β-CD, and significant conformational change of Tyr374 is not found (κ1 = 75° and κ2 = 93°). The location of Trp356 is extensively fitted to the regular conical structure of β-CD, which is unfavorable to the proposed hydrolyzing mechanism, as described later. Generally, CDs have a truncated conical structure with the O-6 atoms at the narrow side and the O-2 and O-3 atoms at the wide side, and the O-2 atom forms an intramolecular hydrogen bond with the O-3 atoms of the neighboring glucose unit. The glucose units of β-CD are arranged in a symmetrical structure, and the O-2— O-3 intramolecular hydrogen bonds strongly contribute to maintaining the round shape of the CD cavity. Therefore, the regular conical structure is thought to be one of the most stable structures for β-CD, and this is a reason why β-CD maintains its regular conical structure through binding to the enzyme. On the other hand, the cavity of α-CD is too small to form a symmetrical structure, and α-CD has a more inclined conical structure lacking a few intramolecular hydrogen bonds of O-2—O-3 (33Manor P.C. Saenger W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1974; 96: 3630-3639Google Scholar). The distorted conical structure of α-CD found in D325N/D421N/α-CD is expected to be more likely than β-CD. Also in the γ-CD complex, the conformational change is found only at Trp356, and it occurs in a different manner from that found in acarbose and β-CD complexes (κ1 = –55° and κ2 = –124° for Trp356 and κ1 = 70° and κ2 = 107° for Tyr374). Trp356 does not strongly interact with γ-CD, and it occupies the space between Tyr374 and Glu354 in order to avoid any steric hindrances with Glc+2 and Glc+3 of γ-CD. If Trp356 adopts other side chain conformations, there are many unusual contacts between γ-CD and the enzyme. This side chain conformation of Trp356 is indispensable for the recognition of γ-CD having a large cavity. Trp356 and Tyr374 can change their conformations of side chain depending on the structure and size of substrates to stabilize the enzyme-substrate complex. Accompanied with the flexible loops of 198–205, 283–293, and 42*–50*, mentioned above, Trp356 and Tyr374 are responsible for the multiple substrate-recognition mechanism of TVAII, performing the unique substrate specificity that hydrolyzes both starch and CDs efficiently. Possible Hydrolyzing Mechanism of TVAII for CDs—Asp325, Glu354, and Asp421 are catalytic residues in TVAII. At the first step of the proposed hydrolyzing mechanism shown in Fig. 5a, the O-ϵ atom of Glu354 protonates the O-4 atom (glycoside oxygen) at a hydrolyzing site (12Sinnot M.L. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1171-1202Google Scholar, 13McCarter J.D. Withers S.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 885-892Google Scholar), and subsequently the O-δ atom of Asp325 attacks the C-1 atom of the saccharide at subsite –1 (34Uitdehaag J.C.M. Mosi R. Kalk K.H. van der Veen B.A. Dijkhuizen L. Withers S.G. Dijkstra B.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 432-436Google Scholar). Asp421 has been suggested to be involved in fixing the substrate and in stabilizing the transition state. In both acarbose and α-CD complexes, the Glu354 makes a hydrogen bond with the N-4 atom of acarbose or O-4 atom of α-CD at the hydrolyzing site, and Asp421 fixes the orientation of Cyt–1/Glc–1 by making hydrogen bonds with O-2 and O-3 atoms, leading to the short distance between the O-δ1 atom of Asp325/Asn325 and C-1 atom of Cyt–1/Glc–1. These interactions between the binding acarbose and α-CD and the three catalytic residues, Asp325, Glu354, and Asp421, found in this study strongly support the proposed hydrolyzing mechanism for α-amylase. However, in the β-CD complex, the binding CDs maintain a regular conical structure. Because both torsion angles (κ1 and κ2) of Trp356 are completely different from those found in α-CD complex, the resultant structure of the β-CD complex is difficult to be the state prior to the structure of α-CD complex. The lone pair of O-4 atoms at the hydrolyzing site moves to the inside of the CD cavity, and Glu354 does not form a hydrogen bond with the O-4 atom at the hydrolyzing site. It is very difficult for Glu354 to protonate the O-4 atom of β-CD, suggesting that the protonation mechanism for hydrolyzing β-CD is different from that for α-CD and starch. In β-CD complexes, the hydrogen bond between the Glu354 and the O-3 atom of Glc+1 is observed, where a proton may be donated from Glu354. In wild-type TVAII, the carboxyl group of Asp421 should form hydrogen bonds with O-2 and O-3 atoms of Glc–1, acting as a proton acceptor. Therefore, in the O-2—O-3 hydrogen bond between Glc–1 and Glc+1, a proton should be donated from the O-3 atom of Glc+1 as shown in Fig. 5b; the distance between the proton and glycosidic oxygen is about 2.5 Å. It could be proposed that the protonation of glycosidic oxygen at the hydrolyzing site is possibly carried out via a proton between O-2 and O-3 atoms, as shown in Fig. 5b. In the γ-CD complex, Glc+1 adopts the intermediate conformation between those found in α-CD and β-CD complexes, and the side chain of Trp356 also adopts the intermediate conformation, where κ1 is almost the same as that found in the α-CD complex. Therefore, the resultant structure of the γ-CD complex is possibly the previous state of the structure of α-CD complex, from which the rotation of the indole ring of Trp356 about κ2 could lead to a similar structure of α-CD complex. This is supported by the fact that the γ-CD binding to cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase can change the conformation of the glucosidic bond at the hydrolyzing site like acarbose because of the eight glucose units making the cyclic structure loose (35Uithaag J.C.M.

https://openalex.org/W2082987235,"Cells of the budding yeast undergo oriented cell division by choosing a specific site for growth depending on their cell type. Haploid a and α cells bud in an axial pattern whereas diploid a/α cells bud in a bipolar pattern. The Ras-like GTPase Rsr1p/Bud1p, its GDP-GTP exchange factor Bud5p, and its GTPase-activating protein Bud2p are essential for selecting the proper site for polarized growth in all cell types. Here we showed that specific residues at the N terminus and the C terminus of Bud5p were important for bipolar budding, while some residues were involved in both axial and bipolar budding. These bipolar-specific mutations of <i>BUD5</i> disrupted proper localization of Bud5p in diploid a/α cells without affecting Bud5p localization in haploid α cells. In contrast, Bud5p expressed in the <i>bud5</i> mutants defective in both budding patterns failed to localize in all cell types. Thus, these results identify specific residues of Bud5p that are likely to be involved in direct interaction with spatial landmarks, which recruit Bud5p to the proper bud site. Finally, we found a new start codon of <i>BUD5</i>, which extends the open reading frame to 210 bp upstream of the previously estimated start site, thus encoding a polypeptide of 608 amino acid residues. Bud5p with these additional N-terminal residues interacted with Bud8p, a potential bipolar landmark, suggesting that the N-terminal region is necessary for recognition of the spatial cues."

There is also a newly discovered family of metal ion-dependent aspartic acid-based PTPs represented by the four Eyes Absent proteins (4Tootle T.L. Silver S.J. Davies E.L. Newman V. Latek R.R.

The largest family of cysteine-based (7Zhou G. Denu J.M. Wu L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28084-28090Google Scholar) phosphatases is made up of those related to the first sequenced PTP, PTP1B (8Charbonneau H. Tonks N.K. Kumar S. Diltz C.D. Harrylock M. Cool D.E. Krebs E.G. Fischer E.H. Walsh K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5252-5256Google Scholar), and the receptor-like enzyme, CD45. Within this family are also 19 phosphatases with predominantly nonprotein substrates, 17 of them specific for the D3-phosphate of inositol phospholipids (9Maehama T. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13375-13378Google Scholar, 10Wishart M.J. Dixon J.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 579-585Google Scholar) and two acting on RNA during the mRNA capping process (11Deshpande T.

Another subgroup of 38 enzymes, referred to as the “classical” PTPs (13Andersen J.N. Jansen P.G. Echwald S.M. Mortensen O.H. Fukuda T. Del Vecchio R. Tonks N.K. Møller N.P.H. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 8-13Google Scholar), have a deep catalytic pocket (∼9 Å), which only allows the long side chain of phosphotyrosine to reach the catalytic machinery (14Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1994; 263: 1397-1404Google Scholar). Accordingly, these PTPs are strictly tyrosine-specific. Other members of the PTP family have a more shallow catalytic pocket, and many of them dephosphorylate both phosphoserine/threonine and phosphotyrosine residues, at least in vitro (15Yuvaniyama J. Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. Saper M.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1328-1331Google Scholar, 16Denu J.M. Zhou G. Wu L. Zhao R. Yuvaniyama J. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. J. Biol.

A. 1997; 94: 9052-9057Google Scholar). These “dual specificity” phosphatases (DSPs) include the 11 MAP kinase phosphatases (MKPs) that dephosphorylate the mitogen-activated protein kinases Erk, Jnk, and p38 (21Saxena M. Mustelin T. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 387-396Google Scholar, 22Alonso A. Rojas A. Godzik A. Mustelin T. Top. Curr. Genet. 2003; 5: 333-358Google Scholar) at their dually phosphorylated TXY activation loop motif. Another subgroup of DSPs, which we have referred to as the “atypical” DSPs (22Alonso A. Rojas A. Godzik A. Mustelin T. Top. Curr. Genet. 2003; 5: 333-358Google Scholar) (as opposed to the “typical” DSPs, the MKPs), includes a number of poorly known enzymes that lack specific MAP kinase-targeting motifs and tend to be much smaller enzymes (less than 250 amino acid residues). The first DSP to be cloned, the VH1 protein from the vaccinia virus (23Guan K.L. Bryoles S.S. Dixon J.E. Nature. 1991; 350: 359-362Google Scholar), is a member of this group, as are the human VHR (24Ishibashi T. Bottaro D.P. Chan A. Kiki T. Aaronson S.A Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12170-12174Google Scholar) and a number of genes given the genomic designations DUSP14, DUSP19, DUSP20, DUSP21, and DUSP22. Although VH1 has been reported to dephosphorylate both MAP kinases and Stat1 (25Najarro P. Traktman P. Lewis J.A. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3185-3196Google Scholar), and VHR can dephosphorylate Erk and Jnk in 293T cells (26Todd J. Tanner K. Denu J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13271-13280Google Scholar) and T cells (27Alonso A. Saxena S. Williams S. Mustelin T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4766-4771Google Scholar, 28Alonso A. Rahmouni S. Williams S. van Stipdonk M. Jaroszewski L. Godzik A. Abraham R.T. Schoenberger S. Mustelin T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 44-48Google Scholar), it appears that at least some of these small atypical DSPs also have functions related to MAP kinases. We recently published (29Alonso A. Merlo J.J. Na S. Kholod N. Williams S. Posada J. Mustelin T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5524-5528Google Scholar) a new atypical DSP, which we termed VHX, for VHR-related MKPX, to honor a GenBank™/NCBI submission of its sequence by Gu and co-workers (GenBank™/NCBI accession numbers AF165519/gi9294744) 2J. Gu, Q. Huang, Y. Yu, S. Xu, Y. Wang, Z. Han, Z. Chen, J. Zhou, Y. Tu, W. Gu, G. Fu, and C. Huang, unpublished data. during the course of our work. This gene is now designated as DUSP22, and it has also been published by others under the names JKAP (30Aoyama K. Nagata M. Oshima K. Matsuda T. Aoki N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27575-27583Google Scholar) and JSP1 (31Shen Y. Luche R. Wei B. Gordon M.L. Diltz C.D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13613-13618Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the first name applied to this gene, MKPX, cannot be given priority because the name was already occupied by another gene, DUSP7 (also known as MKP-X, PYST2, and B59), only adding more confusion to the already crowded PTP nomenclature. Here we report the identification and initial characterization of another DSP, encoded by the DUSP15 gene, which encodes a 235-amino acid DSP closely related to VHX. The new protein, which we refer to as VHY, has the same N-terminal consensus myristoylation signal as VHX; and we show that it is indeed myristoylated and thereby targeted to the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane, where it co-localizes with filamentous actin in membrane ruffles and filop-odia. VHY expression is highest in the testis, where it is mainly found in pachytene spermatozytes. Antibodies—The 9E10 anti-Myc epitope tag mAb was from Roche Applied Science. The anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10 was from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Two rabbits were immunized with a GST fusion protein expressing the entire full-length VHY protein. The resulting antisera were used at 1:1,000 dilution. Plasmids and Site-directed Mutagenesis—The cDNA for VHY was cloned into the 5′-EcoRI–3′-XhoI site of pcDNA3.1myc-his with the tags in the C terminus of the insert. The cDNA for VHX was in the same vector. Point mutants of VHY and VHX were generated using the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (Clontech and verified by sequencing. Northern Blots—These were performed with Northern blot filters and multiple tissue arrays from Clontech, and the full-length VHY cDNA as a probe. The blot for mouse mRNA was prepared by standard protocol using 10 μg of total RNA. Southern Blots—Genomic DNA samples from human prostate cancer cell line PC3 and mouse embryonic stem cell line D3 were digested with several common restriction enzymes with sites in both the human DUSP15 (within the VHY cDNA) and the mouse Dusp15 gene (clone BB616533) and analyzed with Southern blot hybridization using the coding region of the human VHY cDNA as a probe. Histology—Testis samples were collected from adult 129 × C57/Bl6 hybrid mice and immediately fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C for 2 days. The tissue was then washed in 50% ethanol in phosphate-buffered saline and processed for standard paraffin sectioning. After deparaffinization and dehydration, the sections were immersed in 8 m guanidine, HCl (pH 10) overnight as an unmasking treatment. Immunostaining was performed using an ABC kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), except that a 1:200 dilution of rabbit anti-VHY serum or normal rabbit serum was included for 2 h at room temperature as a primary antibody. Mayer's hematoxylin was used for counterstaining. p-Nitrophenyl Phosphate Dephosphorylation Assay—The hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate was assayed at 30 °C for 5 min with 20 μg of enzyme in 100 μl of 0.1 m BisTris, pH 6.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol. The reaction was initiated by the addition of various concentrations of p-nitrophenyl phosphate (ranging from 0.125 to 5 mm) to the reaction mixtures. Nonenzymatic hydrolysis of the substrate was corrected by measuring the control without the addition of enzyme. The amount of product p-nitrophenol was determined from the absorbance at 405 nm detected by a PowerWaveX340 microplate spectrophotometer (Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc.) using a molar extinction coefficient of 18,000 m–1 cm–1. The Km and Vmax were determined by fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using nonlinear regression and the program GraphPad Prism® (version 4.0). Cells and Transfections—293T kidney epithelium cells were kept at logarithmic growth in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 300 mg/ml l-glutamine, and 10 μg/ml gentamycin. They were transiently transfected with a total of 5–15 μg of DNA by lipofection as described previously (32Couture C. Baier G. Oetken C. Williams S. Telford D. Marie-Cardine A. Baier-Bitterlich G. Fischer S. Burn P. Altman A. Mustelin T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5249-5258Google Scholar). Empty vector was added to the control samples to make a constant amount of DNA in each sample. The cells were used for experiments 24 h after transfection. Immunoblotting—Proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose filters, which were immunoblotted as described previously (27Alonso A. Saxena S. Williams S. Mustelin T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4766-4771Google Scholar, 28Alonso A. Rahmouni S. Williams S. van Stipdonk M. Jaroszewski L. Godzik A. Abraham R.T. Schoenberger S. Mustelin T. Nat.

Confocal Microscopy—Double immunofluorescence staining was done as described previously (28Alonso A. Rahmouni S. Williams S. van Stipdonk M. Jaroszewski L. Godzik A. Abraham R.T. Schoenberger S. Mustelin T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 44-48Google Scholar, 33Gjörloff-Wingren A. Saxena M. Han S. Wang X. Alonso A. Renedo M. Oh P. Williams S. Schnitzer J. Mustelin T. Eur. J.

Briefly, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in freshly made 3.7% formaldehyde. The fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.1% saponin in phosphate-buffered saline, blocked in 2.5% normal goat serum in 0.1% saponin in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at room temperature, and then incubated with primary and secondary antibody diluted in the same buffer for 1 h each at room temperature. After three washes with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were mounted onto glass slides and viewed under a confocal laser scanning microscopy MRC-1024 (Bio-Rad). A differential interference contrast image was also taken of most of the cells. The Protein Encoded by DUSP15—A number of human cDNAs have been deposited in the GenBank™ data base as dual specificity protein phosphatase 15′ (gi:30316387), dual specificity phosphatase 15-like (gi:29826315, gi:29826317), or other designations (gi:14031085; gi:21757185), many of them differing in N-terminal and C-terminal sequences. Mouse and rat orthologs were also present. The full-length protein encoded by DUSP15 is a 235-amino acid residue protein with the PTP signature motif, HCX2GX2R, at positions 87–94. It displays 51% identity and 66% similarity with human VHX (DUSP22) over a 184-amino acid alignment (Fig. 1A). Because VHX is its closest relative, we refer to the DUSP15-encoded protein as VHY (for VH1-like member Y). The two proteins are particularly similar in their extreme N termini and around the catalytic core residues, but VHY has a longer C terminus than VHX. The first 10 amino acid residues bear similarity to the consensus myristoylation sequence of Src family kinases (35Mustelin T. Src Family Tyrosine Kinases in Leukocytes. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1994: 1-155Google Scholar). Expression of VHY Is Highest in the Testis—To determine in which tissues and cell types VHY is expressed, we performed a Northern blot using multiple tissue panels (Clontech Inc.) with mRNA from many different tissues and the full-length VHY cDNA as a probe. As shown in Fig. 1C, a prominent ∼1.4-kb mRNA was seen in the testis but only weakly in some other tissues such as brain, spinal cord, and thyroid. A similar result was obtained with a multiple tissue array (Clontech) probed with full-length VHY; the highest expression was found in testis, and a low (but detectable) level was found in many other tissues (not shown). Thus, VHY is expressed at high levels in the testis but can also be detected in some other tissues. To determine whether the corresponding mouse gene shows a corresponding expression pattern, we first performed a Southern blot to ensure that the human VHY cDNA reacts with the mouse DUSP15 gene. Both human and mouse genomic DNA was digested with EcoRV, PstI, HindIII, and KpnI, resolved electrophoretically, and hybridized with the human VHY cDNA probe. Based on the positive result (Fig. 1C), we then performed a Northern blot with mRNA from mouse testis or an embryonic stem cell line, which showed a strong ∼1.4-kb mRNA in the testis sample only. A control L32 ribosomal protein cDNA probe detected an equal band in both samples. Thus, the mouse DUSP15 gene is highly expressed also in mouse testis. Detection of Endogenous VHY Protein in Cell Lines and in the Testis—A GST fusion protein containing the entire open reading frame of VHY was generated, purified, and used for immunization of two rabbits. To test the resulting antisera, we expressed wild-type or catalytically inactive Myc-tagged VHY in 293T cells and then immunoblotted lysates of these cells with the antisera, which reacted well with the proteins (Fig. 2A). The antisera also detected an endogenous protein of 26 kDa in testis but not in mouse embryonic cells, spleen, or human 293T cells (Fig. 2B). Immunohistochemistry of paraformaldehyde-fixed paraffin sections of mouse testis showed an abundant staining of the cytoplasm of pachytene spermatocytes (midstage of meiotic division I) and round spermatids and a weaker staining of Leydig cells, which are somatic cells outside of the seminiferous tubules (Fig. 2C, middle panels and right panel). A normal rabbit serum control staining performed in parallel did not reveal any specific signal (Fig. 2C, left panels). Together with the demonstration that shows that the mouse DUSP15 gene is expressed in the testis, these findings indicate that VHY is present at readily detectable levels in mouse testis and is found mostly in developing spermatocytes. This is likely to be true also in humans. VHY Is an Active Phosphatase—To formally demonstrate that VHY is a catalytically active phosphatase, as predicted for its amino acid sequence, we measured its ability to dephosphorylate the general PTPase substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate. Although the catalytic cysteine mutant VHY-C88S was inactive in these assays, the GST fusion protein of wild-type VHY readily converted p-nitrophenyl phosphate into the yellow p-nitrophenol, with a Km of 0.199 ± 0.0137 mm and Kcat of 0.136 ± 0.002 s–1 (Fig. 3A). Thus, VHY is a catalytically active phosphatase that requires the conserved catalytic residue Cys-88 for activity. Myristoylation of VHY—The first five amino acid residues in VHY are identical to those in VHX, and both proteins have a Lys at position 7. This sequence is similar to the extreme N terminus of Src family kinases (Fig. 3B). Therefore, we decided to determine whether VHY is post-translationally modified by the attachment of myristic acid to Gly-2. 293T cells were transfected with empty vector or the expression plasmids for VHY or VHX, and metabolically labeled with [14C]myristic acid for 6 h. The proteins were then immunoprecipitated, resolved on SDS gels, and processed for fluorography, which revealed that both VHY and VHX were readily labeled (Fig. 3C). No other bands were detected, and the vector control lane was devoid of bands. Thus, both VHX and VHY are myristoylated. Myristoylation Determines the Subcellular Location of VHY—Although myristoylation of Src family kinases is required for plasma membrane targeting of these proteins (35Mustelin T. Src Family Tyrosine Kinases in Leukocytes. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1994: 1-155Google Scholar), other myristoylated proteins, e.g. the phosphatase calcineurin (36Aitken A. Cohen P. Santikarn S. Williams D.H. Calder A.G. Smith A. Klee C.B. FEBS Lett. 1982; 150: 314-318Google Scholar), are cytosolic. To determine where in the cell VHY is located, we first transfected 293T cells with the VHY expression plasmid and stained them with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-Myc mAb. When these cells were viewed under a confocal microscope, it was clear that most of the fluorescence was enriched at the plasma membrane (Fig. 4). The staining was not even but was concentrated in ruffles and other membrane features. Some fluorescence was also consistently seen on internal membranes. Cells transfected with empty vector did not display any fluorescence at all (Fig. 4). Finally, cells transfected with the myristoylation site mutant VHY-G2A did not show any membrane enrichment (Fig. 4, bottom panels). Instead, the mutant VHY was located diffusely throughout the cell. Very similar results were obtained for VHX (data not shown); the unmodified protein was partly located at the plasma membrane, whereas the VHX-G2A mutant was diffusely cytoplasmic. Thus, myristoylation of both VHX and VHY at Gly-2 is required for their membrane targeting. In this paper, we describe and begin the characterization of a novel DSP, VHY, which is encoded by the DUSP15 gene on human chromosome 20q11.21 and is related to the VHX (29Alonso A. Merlo J.J. Na S. Kholod N. Williams S. Posada J. Mustelin T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5524-5528Google Scholar) encoded by the DUSP22 gene on 6p25.3. The DUSP15 gene consists of 7 exons, whereas the DUSP22 gene contains 9 exons. The two enzymes are particularly similar in their extreme N termini, which in both proteins are encoded by a similar exon 1 (amino acid residues 1–7 in VHY). The two proteins are also very similar within the cores of their catalytic domains, and the main difference between them is that VHY has a longer C-terminal tail. They also differ strikingly in tissue distribution; VHY expressed at high levels only in the testis and at low levels in other tissues and cell types, whereas VHX is broadly expressed (29Alonso A. Merlo J.J. Na S. Kholod N. Williams S. Posada J. Mustelin T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5524-5528Google Scholar). The N termini of VHY and VHX contain a consensus myristoyl transferase recognition motif (35Mustelin T. Src Family Tyrosine Kinases in Leukocytes. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1994: 1-155Google Scholar, 36Aitken A. Cohen P. Santikarn S. Williams D.H. Calder A.G. Smith A. Klee C.B. FEBS Lett. 1982; 150: 314-318Google Scholar, 37Kaplan J.M. Mardon G.

Nature. 1985; 314: 374-377Google Scholar) similar to that found in Src family kinases (35Mustelin T. Src Family Tyrosine Kinases in Leukocytes. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1994: 1-155Google Scholar, 39Buss J.E. Kamps M.P. Sefton B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 2697-2704Google Scholar, 40Marchildon G.A. Casnellie J.E. Walsh K.A. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7679-7682Google Scholar) and calcineurin B (36Aitken A. Cohen P. Santikarn S. Williams D.H. Calder A.G. Smith A. Klee C.B. FEBS Lett. 1982; 150: 314-318Google Scholar) and indeed are modified by myristic acid, presumably at Gly-2 (41Kamps M.P. Buss J.E. Sefton B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4625-4628Google Scholar). This modification correlates with the plasma membrane enrichment of VHY. VHX is also modified by myristic acid (Fig. 3C) and is enriched at the plasma membrane, where it co-localizes with membrane ruffles. Mutation of Gly-2 to prevent myristoylation also resulted in the loss of this membrane enrichment. Thus, VHX and VHY define a new subgroup of small DSPs anchored at the plasma membrane and possibly other membranes by an N-terminal myristic acid moiety. Both VHY and VHX also belong to a larger group of 18 atypical DSPs characterized by their small size (less than 250 amino acid residues) and a lack of protein-protein interaction domains or motifs, such as the Cdc25 homology region (CH2) present in the larger MAP kinase-specific typical DSPs (23Guan K.L. Bryoles S.S. Dixon J.E. Nature. 1991; 350: 359-362Google Scholar). The atypical DSP group also contains VHR (DUSP3) (24Ishibashi T. Bottaro D.P. Chan A. Kiki T. Aaronson S.A Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12170-12174Google Scholar), MKP6 (DUSP14) (42Marti F. Krause A. Post N.H. Lyddane C. Dupont B. Sadelain M. King P.D. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 197-206Google Scholar), BEDP (DUSP13A; AAK77966, gi15072533), TMDP (DUSP13B) (43Nakamura K. Shima H. Watanabe M. Haneji T. Kikuch K. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 819-825Google Scholar), LMW-DSP20 (DUSP18) (44Hood K.L. Tobin J.F. Yoon C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 298: 545-551Google Scholar), SKRP1 (DUSP19) (45Zama T. Aoki R. Kamimoto T. Inoue K. Ikeda Y. Hagiwara M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23909-23918Google Scholar, 46Zama T. Aoki R. Kamimoto T. Inoue K. Ikeda Y. Hagiwara M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23919-23926Google Scholar), BJ-HCC-26 or LMW-DSP21 (DUSP21) (44Hood K.L. Tobin J.F. Yoon C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 298: 545-551Google Scholar), and several unpublished open reading frames, which we are currently characterizing. Interestingly, many of these genes have been reported to be expressed at their highest levels in the testis, whereas others are found in muscle tissue, hematopoietic cells, or broadly in other tissues and cell types. The physiological functions of most of these enzymes are unknown, and most of them have not yet been addressed experimentally at all. Some data exist for VHR, which dephosphorylates the MAP kinases Erk and Jnk (26Todd J. Tanner K. Denu J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13271-13280Google Scholar, 27Alonso A. Saxena S. Williams S. Mustelin T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4766-4771Google Scholar, 28Alonso A. Rahmouni S. Williams S. van Stipdonk M. Jaroszewski L. Godzik A. Abraham R.T. Schoenberger S. Mustelin T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 44-48Google Scholar) and requires tyrosine phosphorylation at Tyr-138 for biological activity (28Alonso A. Rahmouni S. Williams S. van Stipdonk M. Jaroszewski L. Godzik A. Abraham R.T. Schoenberger S. Mustelin T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 44-48Google Scholar). MKP6 was cloned as a protein physically associated with the CD28 co-receptor in T cells, where MKP6 was proposed to dephosphorylate Erk and Jnk (42Marti F. Krause A. Post N.H. Lyddane C. Dupont B. Sadelain M. King P.D. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 197-206Google Scholar). SKRP1 is involved in the regulation of Jnk and interacts with its upstream regulators MKK7 and ASK1 (apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1) but not with MEKK1 (44Hood K.L. Tobin J.F. Yoon C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 298: 545-551Google Scholar, 45Zama T. Aoki R. Kamimoto T. Inoue K. Ikeda Y. Hagiwara M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23909-23918Google Scholar). Finally, VHX also has been linked to MAP kinase regulation, with a proposed role as a positive regulator of Jnk activation (31Shen Y. Luche R. Wei B. Gordon M.L. Diltz C.D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13613-13618Google Scholar, 47Chen A.J. Zhou G. Juan T. Colicos S.M. Cannon J.P. Cabriera-Hansen M. Meyer C.F. Jurecic R. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Fletcher F. Tan T.H. Belmont J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36592-36601Google Scholar). VHX associates with p38 and Jnk in vivo but not in vitro (30Aoyama K. Nagata M. Oshima K. Matsuda T. Aoki N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27575-27583Google Scholar, 47Chen A.J. Zhou G. Juan T. Colicos S.M. Cannon J.P. Cabriera-Hansen M. Meyer C.F. Jurecic R. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Fletcher F. Tan T.H. Belmont J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36592-36601Google Scholar), suggesting that the interaction requires additional components. Candidates include MKK7 or c-Jun, both of which interact with VHX (31Shen Y. Luche R. Wei B. Gordon M.L. Diltz C.D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13613-13618Google Scholar, 47Chen A.J. Zhou G. Juan T. Colicos S.M. Cannon J.P. Cabriera-Hansen M. Meyer C.F. Jurecic R. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Fletcher F. Tan T.H. Belmont J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36592-36601Google Scholar). Together, these results indicate that VHX may play a regulatory role in the Jnk or p38 pathways, but they do not yet reveal what phosphoprotein(s) VHX dephosphorylates. It should be noted that most studies on VHX, including our own (29Alonso A. Merlo J.J. Na S. Kholod N. Williams S. Posada J. Mustelin T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5524-5528Google Scholar), used N-terminally tagged constructs that prevent myristoylation of Gly-2. This presumably hindered the correct subcellular targeting of the protein. It now remains to be determined whether the physiological function(s) of VHX and VHY are related and whether they truly are connected to the Jnk kinase pathway."
