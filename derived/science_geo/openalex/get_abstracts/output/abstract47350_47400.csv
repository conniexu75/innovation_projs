https://openalex.org/W2128940002,"5-azacytidine treatment of mouse embryonic fibroblasts converts them to myoblasts at a frequency suggesting alteration of one or only a few closely linked regulatory loci. Assuming such loci to be differentially expressed as poly(A)+ RNA in proliferating myoblasts, we prepared proliferating myoblast-specific, subtracted cDNA probes to screen a myocyte cDNA library. Based on a number of criteria, three cDNAs were selected and characterized. We show that expression of one of these cDNAs transfected into fibroblasts, where it is not normally expressed, is sufficient to convert them to stable myoblasts. Myogenesis also occurs, but to a lesser extent, when this cDNA is expressed in a number of other cell lines. The major open reading frame encoded by this cDNA contains a short protein segment similar to a sequence present in the myc protein family."
https://openalex.org/W2118299921,"We have constructed a ""minilocus"" that contains the 5' and 3' flanking regions of the human beta-globin locus and the beta-globin gene. These regions are characterized by erythroid-specific DNAase I-superhypersensitive sites and are normally located approximately 50 kb 5' and 20 kb 3' of the beta-globin gene. This minilocus is expressed tissue-specifically in transgenic mice at a level directly related to its copy number yet independent of its position of integration in the genome. Moreover, the expression per gene copy is the same in each mouse and as high as that of the endogenous mouse beta-globin gene. These results indicate that the DNA regions flanking the human beta-globin locus contain dominant regulatory sequences that specify position-independent expression and normally activate the complete human multigene beta-globin locus."

https://openalex.org/W1590204800,"Peptides containing the tripeptide sequence Arg-Gly-Asp can duplicate or inhibit the cell attachment-promoting effects of fibronectin and vitronectin. Peptides analogous to a prototype peptide, Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-Pro-Cys, the sequence of which was taken from the cell attachment site of fibronectin, were assayed for their relative abilities to inhibit the attachment of cells to a fibronectin or vitronectin substrate. A peptide having the L-Arg residue replaced with D-Arg showed no difference in this capacity, whereas substituting Gly with D-Ala or L-Asp with D-Asp resulted in completely inactive peptides. Replacement of L-Ser with D-Ser drastically reduced the influence that the resulting peptide had on the vitronectin interaction, but this peptide showed little difference in its effect on the binding of cells to fibronectin when compared with the prototype peptide. Furthermore, substitution of the Ser with L-Asn resulted in a peptide that had an apparent increased preference for the fibronectin receptor and decreased preference for the vitronectin receptor. Conversely, threonine in this position gave a peptide with increased preference for the vitronectin receptor, whereas L-Pro in this position gave a completely inactive peptide. Finally, by cyclicizing the prototype peptide to restrict its conformational flexibility, a peptide was obtained that was a much improved inhibitor of attachment of cells to vitronectin and yet nearly inactive with respect to the interactions of cells with fibronectin substrates. These studies lend support to the hypothesis that different Arg-Gly-Asp-directed adhesion receptors can recognize differences in the conformation and environment of the Arg-Gly-Asp tripeptide, and they establish the feasibility of obtaining synthetic probes that are more selective for individual receptors than are the peptides modeled after the natural sequences of adhesive extracellular matrix molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2028317903,"We have analyzed intracellular distributions of mRNAs for the cytoskeletal proteins actin, vimentin, and tubulin by in situ hybridization. Although polyadenylated RNA was homogeneously distributed throughout the cell, actin mRNA demonstrated a nonhomogeneous distribution in 95% of randomly selected chicken embryonic myoblasts and fibroblasts, as detected by isotopic and nonisotopic techniques. Actin mRNA concentrations were highest at cell extremities, generally in lamellipodia, where grain densities were up to 16-fold higher than in areas near the nucleus. Vimentin mRNA, unlike actin mRNA, was distributed near the nucleus. Tubulin mRNA appeared most concentrated in the peripheral cytoplasm. These results demonstrate that cytoplasmic mRNAs are localized in specific, nonrandom cellular patterns and that localized concentrations of specific proteins may result from corresponding localization of their respective mRNAs. Hence, actin mRNA distribution may result in increased concentration of actin filaments in lamellipodia of motile cells."
https://openalex.org/W2076134621,"The promoter of the mouse albumin gene contains at least six binding sites for specific DNA-binding proteins (A to F). Four of these sites (A, D, E, and F) can be occupied by transcription factors that are considerably enriched in liver nuclei, as compared to spleen or brain nuclei. These factors consist of a heat-stable protein that fills sites A, D, and F, and a member of a family of nuclear factor I (NF-I) related proteins that occupies site E. Site C binds a protein that is equally abundant in liver, brain, and spleen nuclei. Occupancy of this site and the binding of the heat-stable factor to the immediately adjacent site D appear to be mutually exclusive. However, both of these competing binding sites are required for maximal in vitro transcription."

The growth of a viral mutant that is unable to produce the RNA is inhibited by interferon, while wild-type virus is not affected. VAI RNA prevents activation of the interferon-induced P1/eIF-2 alpha kinase. This inhibition can be reproduced in extracts of interferon-treated cells where purified VAI RNA prevents activation of latent kinase by double-stranded RNA."
https://openalex.org/W1577149434,"The mechanism that concentrates the urine to an osmolality several times that of systemic plasma results in high concentrations of solutes (particularly NaCl and urea) in extracellular fluid of renal medulla, but not in the labyrinth of the renal cortex. Intracellular and extracellular osmolality must be equal in animals, but the known intracellular levels of Na and K salts and urea in renal medullas are much too low to balance the high extracellular osmolality. The purpose of these studies was to identify the other intracellular osmolytes that must be present. Cortexes and medullas from rabbit and rat kidneys were analyzed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance, mass spectrometry, and chemical assays to determine the identity and amount of organic solutes. Large amounts of glycerophosphorylcholine, betaine, sorbitol, and inositol were found in both species localized almost exclusively to the inner medulla. In rabbits during antidiuresis glycerophosphorylcholine, betaine, and sorbitol were present in the inner medulla, at concentrations of 21.1, 34.8, and 20.8 mumol/g wet weight, respectively, but were not detected in the cortex. Inositol was present in rabbit inner medulla at 10.7 mumol/g wet weight and was also present in the cortex, but at lower concentration. None of the above metabolites was present in measurable amounts in urine or peripheral plasma. The accumulation in the cells of the inner medulla of relatively large amounts of betaine, sorbitol, glycerophosphorylcholine and inositol during antidiuresis suggests that they may play a significant role in the maintenance of intracellular osmotic balance."
https://openalex.org/W1571924012,"We have obtained overlapping cDNA clones for the entire coding sequence of the rat cartilage proteoglycan core protein from the Swarm rat chondrosarcoma. These cDNAs hybridize to two sizes of RNA transcripts of 8.2 and 8.9 kilobase pairs, which contain large 3′-untranslated sequences. The total contiguous cDNA is 6.55 kilobase pairs in size, and codes for a 2124-residue protein, including a 19-residue signal peptide. The sequence forms a series of eight structural domains including two globules, (Mr = 37,000 and 22,000) at the NH2 terminus of the molecule, one a complete and one a partial copy of the cartilage link protein. The major feature of the deduced protein sequence is a 1,104-residue segment containing 117 Ser-Gly sequences, the presumed chondroitin sulfate attachment sites. These are arranged in three domains of 428, 503, and 173 amino acids. The first domain contains 11 complete or partial repeats of a 40-residue unit, and the second domain is composed of six copies of a 100-residue repeating sequence. The first pattern is the more highly conserved, and may have given rise to the second. The carboxyl-terminal domain is a third globule which has homology with animal lectins."
https://openalex.org/W1583656960,"The major substrate for Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase III in mammalian cells is a species of Mr 100,000 that has a primarily cytoplasmic localization. This substrate has now been identified as elongation factor-2 (EF-2), a protein that catalyzes the translocation of peptidyl-tRNA on the ribosome. The amino acid sequence of 18 residues from the N-terminal of the Mr 100,000 CaM-dependent protein kinase III substrate purified from rat pancreas was found to be identical to the N-terminal sequence of authentic rat EF-2 as previously deduced from nucleic acid sequencing of a cDNA (Kohno, K., Uchida, T., Ohkubo, H., Nakanishi, S., Nakanishi, T., Fukui, T., Ohtsuka, E., Ikehara, M., and Okada, Y. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 83, 4978-4982). CaM-dependent protein kinase III phosphorylated EF-2 in vitro with a stoichiometry of approximately 1 mol/mol on a threonine residue. Amino acid sequencing of the purified tryptic phosphopeptide revealed that this threonine residue lies within the sequence: Ala-Gly-Glu-Thr-Arg-Phe-Thr-Asp-Thr-Arg (residues 51-60 of EF-2). The Mr 100,000 protein was stoichiometrically ADP-ribosylated in vitro by the addition of diphtheria toxin and NAD. The Mr 100,000 protein was photoaffinity labeled with a GTP analog and the protein had an endogenous GTPase activity that could be stimulated by the addition of salt-washed ribosomes. These properties are all characteristic of EF-2. Dephospho-EF-2 could support poly(U)-directed polyphenylalanine synthesis in a reconstituted elongation system when combined with EF-1. In the same system, phospho-EF-2 was virtually inactive in supporting polypeptide synthesis; this effect could be reversed by dephosphorylation of phospho-EF-2. These results suggest that intracellular Ca2+ inhibits protein synthesis in mammalian cells via CaM-dependent protein kinase III-catalyzed phosphorylation of EF-2."

https://openalex.org/W1669858368,"In order to analyze the factors regulating agonist-stimulated Ca2+ mobilization, cytosolic free [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]i) was measured directly in fura-2-loaded rat parotid acinar cells. Stimulation of muscarinic receptors by carbachol produced a dose-dependent rise in [Ca2+]i. In the presence of external Ca2+, the initial transient rise was followed by a maintained elevation. The maintained elevation is dependent on the presence of external Ca2+. Removal of Ca2+ by addition of EGTA caused a rapid decline in [Ca2+]i back to base line. In the absence of external Ca2+, only an initial transient peak in [Ca2+]i was seen which then declined to base line; the maintained elevation in [Ca2+]i could then be evoked by addition of Ca2+ in the continued presence of carbachol. Muscarinic receptor occupation by carbachol is required to maintain the elevated level of [Ca2+]i; addition of the muscarinic antagonist, atropine, caused [Ca2+]i to decline back to the basal level. The maintained elevation in [Ca2+]i, but not the initial transient peak, can also be blocked by Ni2+ but was unaffected by the organic Ca2+ antagonists. Total substitution of external Na+ with the impermeant cation, N-methyl-D-glucamine, had no effect on either the initial or the maintained response to carbachol; however, total substitution of Na+ with K+ attenuated the maintained response while not affecting the initial peak. Refilling of the intracellular Ca2+ store was also studied and found to take place in the absence of agonist and with no substantial elevation in [Ca2+]i. These experiments also showed that not all of the intracellular vesicular Ca2+ stores can be released by agonists. From these results, we propose a model for the regulation of [Ca2+]i."
https://openalex.org/W1572688882,"We have recently characterized the major hydroperoxide-reducing enzyme of human plasma as a glutathione peroxidase (Maddipati, K. R., Gasparski, C., and Marnett, L. J. (1987) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 254, 9-17). We now report the purification and kinetic characterization of this enzyme. The purification steps involved ammonium sulfate precipitation, hydrophobic interaction chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose, anion exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. The purified peroxidase has a specific activity of 26-29 mumol/min/mg with hydrogen peroxide as substrate. The human plasma glutathione peroxidase is a tetramer of identical subunits of 21.5 kDa molecular mass as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and is different from human erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase. The plasma peroxidase is a selenoprotein containing one selenium per subunit. Unlike several other glutathione peroxidases this enzyme exhibits saturation kinetics with respect to glutathione (Km for glutathione = 4.3 mM). The peroxidase exhibits high affinity for hydroperoxides with Km values ranging from 2.3 microM for 13-hydroperoxy-9,11-octadecadienoic acid to 13.3 microM for hydrogen peroxide at saturating glutathione concentration. These kinetic parameters are suggestive of the potential of human plasma glutathione peroxidase as an important regulator of plasma hydroperoxide levels."
https://openalex.org/W1987364221,"DNA repair was examined in the c-abl and c-mos proto-oncogenes in UV-irradiated mouse 3T3 fibroblasts using an optimized assay for measuring pyrimidine dimers in single-copy nucleotide sequences. We found similar initial dimer frequencies in the two genes. Within 24 hr, 85% of the dimers were removed from the 20 kb intragenic BamHI restriction fragment of the expressed c-abl gene, while only 22% of the dimers were removed from the 15 kb EcoRI fragment that spans the transcriptionally inactive c-mos locus. Quiescent and actively growing cells showed similar relative efficiencies of repair in the two regions. This is the first demonstration of differential DNA repair in two different genes. These findings have important implications for the mechanisms of proto-oncogene activation."
https://openalex.org/W1565539489,"The bidirectional surface transfer of free cholesterol (FC) between Fu5AH rat hepatoma cells and human high density lipoprotein (HDL) was studied. Cells and HDL were prelabeled with [4-14C]FC and [7-3H]FC, respectively. Influx and efflux of FC were measured simultaneously from the appearance of 3H counts in cells and 14C counts in medium. Results were analyzed by a computerized procedure which fitted sets of kinetic data to a model assuming that cell and HDL FC populations each formed a single homogeneous pool and that together the pools formed a closed system. This analysis yielded values for the first-order rate constants of FC influx and efflux (ki and ke), from which influx and efflux of FC mass (Fi and Fe) could be calculated. With normal HDL, the uptake and release of FC tracers conformed well to the above-described model; Fi and Fe were approximately equal, suggesting an exchange of FC between cells and HDL. HDL was depleted of phospholipid (PL) by treatment with either phospholipase A2 or heparin-releasable rat hepatic lipase, followed by incubation with bovine serum albumin. PL depletion of HDL had little or no effect on ki, but reduced ke, indicating that PL-deficient HDL is a relatively poor acceptor of cell cholesterol. The reduction in ke resulted in initial Fi greater than Fe and, thus, in net uptake of FC by the cells. This result explained previous results demonstrating net uptake of FC from PL-depleted HDL. In the presence of an inhibitor of acyl coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase, the steady state distribution of FC mass between cells and HDL was accurately predicted by the ratio of rate constants for FC flux. This result provided additional validation for describing FC flux in terms of first-order rate constants and homogeneous cell and HDL FC pools."

https://openalex.org/W1489921015,"Acetaldehyde, the first metabolite of ethanol, mediates many of the biological effects of ethanol. We have previously shown that acetaldehyde, but not ethanol, stimulates collagen production in cultured human fibroblasts (Holt, K., Bennett, M., and Chojkier, M. (1984) Hepatology 4, 843-848). Here, we examined the effects of acetaldehyde on collagen gene expression. Confluent human fetal fibroblasts were incubated for up to 4 h in the presence of ascorbate (0.2 mM) alone or with the addition of either ethanol (12 mM) or acetaldehyde (200 microM). Acetaldehyde induced the production of collagen (up to 2.5-fold) and had a small inhibitory effect on procollagen secretion (-20%). The steady-state levels of mRNAs were measured by hybridizing total cellular RNA to specific cDNA probes at high stringency. Acetaldehyde increased the steady-state level of collagen alpha 1(I) and collagen alpha 2(I) mRNAs about 3-fold and had small effects on beta-actin mRNA (+50%) and collagenase mRNA (-50%). Northern blots revealed that the RNAs were intact and that acetaldehyde preferentially increased the abundance of the longer of the two collagen alpha 1(I) transcripts. Acetaldehyde increased both collagen alpha 1(I) and collagen alpha 1(III) transcriptional activity by 2.5-fold and had small effects on beta-actin and collagenase gene transcription. The increase in both collagen production and collagen mRNA levels induced by acetaldehyde was blocked by methylene blue, a scavenger of reducing equivalents. These data indicate that reducing equivalents, which enhance the formation and stability of acetaldehyde-protein adducts, may be required for acetaldehyde-stimulated collagen production. Thus, this study suggests that acetaldehyde increases collagen production by increasing collagen gene transcription in cultured human fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2048672858,"After amputation of a limb from Urodele amphibians, division of the blastemal cells (the progenitor cells of the regenerate) depends on one or more unidentified growth factors provided by the nerve supply. Here we show that glial growth factor (GGF), a mitogenic protein previously purified from the bovine pituitary, is present in newt nervous system extracts. It is also detectable in extracts of the forelimb regeneration blastema, and its level there decreases after denervation. We have previously shown that blastemal cells dependent on the nerve for division are marked by a monoclonal antibody called 22/18. When denervated blastemas are cultured in the presence of partially purified GGF from newt brain, or pure GGF from the bovine pituitary, the thymidine labeling index of blastemal cells that are 22/18-positive is increased as much as sevenfold. These data indicate that GGF plays a role in nerve-dependent proliferation in the blastema."
https://openalex.org/W1623435755,"The hemagglutinin of influenza virus undergoes a conformational change at low pH, which results in exposure of a hydrophobic segment of the molecule, crucial to expression of viral fusion activity. We have studied the effects of incubation of the virus at low pH either at 37 or 0 degrees C. Treatment of the virus alone at pH 5.0 induces the virus particles to become hydrophobic, as assessed by measuring the binding of zwitterionic liposomes to the virus. At 37 degrees C this hydrophobicity is transient, electron microscopic examination of the virus reveals a highly disorganized spike layer, and fusion activity toward ganglioside-containing zwitterionic liposomes, measured at 37 degrees C with a kinetic fluorescence assay, is irreversibly lost. By contrast, after preincubation of the virus alone at pH 5.0 and 0 degrees C fusion activity remains unaffected. Yet, the preincubation at 0 degrees C does result in exposure of the hydrophobic segment of hemagglutinin, but now hydrophobicity is sustained and viral spike morphology unaltered. Hydrophobicity also remains to a significant extent upon pH neutralization, but fusion activity is negligible under these conditions. It is concluded that for optimal expression of fusion activity the virus must be bound to the target membrane before exposure to low pH. Furthermore, even after exposure of the hydrophobic segment of hemagglutinin, fusion occurs only at low pH. Finally, fusion occurs only at elevated temperature, possibly reflecting the unfolding of hemagglutinin trimers or the cooperative action of several hemagglutinin trimers in the reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1495608148,"Using gel, ion-exchange, and reverse-phase chromatography monitored by radioimmunoassays specific for five sequences of preprocholecystokinin (prepro-CCK), its processing products were measured in neutral and acid extracts of porcine cerebral cortex before and after incubation with trypsin, carboxypeptidase B, and arylsulfatase. Three categories of peptides were found: biologically active peptides, i.e. peptides with the alpha-amidated COOH terminus Trp-Met-Asp-Phe-NH2, comprising large CCKs, i.e. peptides larger than CCK-58 and peptides eluting like CCK-58, CCK-33, and CCK-22; CCK-octapeptides in sulfated and traces of nonsulfated forms; and small CCKs, i.e. traces of CCK-7, large amounts of CCK-5, and modest concentrations of CCK-4 (the structures of CCK-5 and -4 were confirmed by sequence analysis); four NH2-terminal fragments, of which the two predominant ones correspond to the desnonapeptide fragments of CCK-58 and CCK-33; and COOH-terminal extended peptides corresponding to glycine-extended CCK-58, CCK-33, and CCK-8 in small but significant amounts. Thus, in addition to CCK-8 the porcine cerebral cortex synthesizes larger and smaller active CCK peptides in quantities of an order similar to those of CCK-8. The occurrence of these together with the NH2-terminal fragments and glycine-extended peptides can be explained only by the existence of different processing pathways for preproCCK. Consequently, the results suggest that cerebral CCK neurons are heterogeneous and comprise at least three populations with different biosynthetic machineries."
https://openalex.org/W2130154023,"The pattern of protein synthesis in the mouse egg shows several changes at fertilization and during first mitosis. Three groups of newly synthesized proteins, with molecular weights of about 30,000, 35,000, and 46,000, show variations in mobility on one- and two-dimensional gels that correlate with the cell cycle. Each group is composed of a polypeptide that is synthesized in unmodified form during interphase but is modified reversibly during meiosis or mitosis, by a process involving phosphorylation. Although these proteins cease to be synthesized during the second cell cycle, those made earlier persist and continue to show the same modifications during the next cell cycle. Like other eggs, fertilized mouse eggs show a requirement for protein synthesis in order to enter mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W1530871629,"Cysteine conjugate beta-lyase activity from rat kidney cortex was found in the cystosolic and mitochondrial fractions. With 2 mM S-(2-benzothiazolyl)-L-cysteine as the substrate, approximately two-thirds of the total beta-lyase activity was present in the cytosolic fraction. The kinetics of beta-lyase activity with three cysteine S-conjugates were different in the cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions, and the mitochondrial beta-lyase was much more sensitive to inhibition by aminooxyacetic acid than was the cytosolic activity. These results indicate that the beta-lyase activities in the two subcellular fractions are catalyzed by distinct enzymes. Nephrotoxic cysteine S-conjugates of halogenated hydrocarbons that require bioactivation by cysteine conjugate beta-lyase (S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine (DCVC), S-(2-chloro-1,1,2-trifluoroethyl)-L-cysteine, CTFC) were potent inhibitors of state 3 respiration in rat kidney mitochondria. Fractionation of mitochondria by digitonin treatment and comparison with marker enzyme distributions showed that the mitochondrial beta-lyase activity is localized in the outer mitochondrial membrane. Inhibition of the beta-lyase prevented the mitochondrial toxicity of DCVC and CTFC, and nonmetabolizable, alpha-methyl analogues of DCVC and CTFC were not toxic. Neither DCVC nor CTFC was toxic to mitoplasts, indicating that activation by the beta-lyase occurs on the outer membrane and may be essential for the expression of toxicity; in contrast, the direct acting nephrotoxin S-(2-chloroethyl)-DL-cysteine was toxic to both mitochondria and mitoplasts. Thus, the suborganelle localization of DCVC and CTFC bioactivation correlates with the observed pattern of toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W1497958401,"The key regulatory enzyme of cholesterol, dolichol, and isopentenyl adenosine biosynthesis, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase) is a 97-kilodalton transmembrane glycoprotein which was believed until recently to reside exclusively in the endoplasmic reticulum of mammalian cells. However, several recent publications have shown that the enzyme in liver cells is present not only in the endoplasmic reticulum but also within peroxisomes. In an effort to clarify the role of peroxisomal HMG-CoA reductase, highly purified (95%) rat liver peroxisomes from cholestyramine-treated rats were incubated with RS-[2-14C]mevalonic acid plus cytosolic proteins and then tested for the presence of newly synthesized cholesterol. For comparison, highly purified microsomes from the same liver preparation were incubated at several protein concentrations under the same conditions. A three-step procedure was employed to resolve the newly synthesized cholesterol from the complex mixture of sterol intermediates in cholesterol biosynthesis. After termination of the reaction and addition of a [3H]cholesterol standard, the incubation products were extracted and separated by thin layer chromatography into a number of fractions. The fraction containing C-27 sterols was further resolved by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. After acetylation, the products were then separated by silicic acid high pressure liquid chromatography. Confirmation of the identity of newly synthesized cholesterol was obtained by recrystallization with added non-radioactive cholestenyl acetate standard. The results indicate that highly purified rat liver peroxisomes are able to convert mevalonic acid to cholesterol in the presence of cytosolic fraction in vitro. An abstract of these results has been published (Krisans, S. K., Thompson, S. L., Burrows, R., and Laub, R. J. (1986) J. Cell Biol. 103, 525 (abstr.)."

https://openalex.org/W1500785166,"The effect of phosphatidylserine exogenously added to the medium on de novo biosynthesis of phosphatidylserine was investigated in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells. When cells were cultured for several generations in medium supplemented with phosphatidylserine and 32Pi, the incorporation of 32Pi into cellular phosphatidylserine was remarkably inhibited, the degree of inhibition being dependent upon the concentration of added phosphatidylserine. 32Pi uptake into cellular phosphatidylethanolamine was also partly reduced by the addition of exogenous phosphatidylserine, consistent with the idea that phosphatidylethanolamine is biosynthesized via decarboxylation of phosphatidylserine. However, incorporation of 32Pi into phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin, and phosphatidylinositol was not significantly affected. In contrast, the addition of either phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin, phosphatidylethanolamine, or phosphatidylinositol to the medium did not inhibit endogenous biosynthesis of the corresponding phospholipid. Radiochemical and chemical analyses of the cellular phospholipid composition revealed that phosphatidylserine in cells grown with 80 microM phosphatidylserine was almost entirely derived from the added phospholipid. Phosphatidylserine uptake was also directly determined by using [3H]serine-labeled phospholipid. Pulse and pulse-chase experiments with L-[U-14C] serine showed that when cells were cultured with 80 microM phosphatidylserine, the rate of synthesis of phosphatidylserine was reduced 3-5-fold whereas the turnover of newly synthesized phosphatidylserine was normal. Enzyme assaying of extracts prepared from cells grown with and without phosphatidylserine indicated that the inhibition of de novo phosphatidylserine biosynthesis by the added phosphatidylserine appeared not to be caused by a reduction in the level of the enzyme involved in the base-exchange reaction between phospholipids and serine. These results demonstrate that exogenous phosphatidylserine can be efficiently incorporated into Chinese hamster ovary cells and utilized for membrane biogenesis, endogenous phosphatidylserine biosynthesis thereby being suppressed."
https://openalex.org/W1599100616,"Abstract A cDNA clone encoding a small cysteine and serine-rich basic protein has been isolated from a mouse testis cDNA library. This cDNA clone encodes the mouse homologue of a protein involved in the initial phases of condensation of chromatin during spermiogenesis in rats, TP2, based on similarities in the sequence of the carboxyl terminus, composition, molecular weight, and electrophoretic mobility. Mouse TP2 can be divided into a highly basic domain comprising about one-third of the polypeptide chain at the carboxyl terminus and a much less basic domain comprising the remaining two-thirds at the amino terminus. The 5' end of the mouse TP2 mRNA contains two in-phase initiation codons both of which may be used generating two polypeptides which differ in length at the amino terminus. Southern blots demonstrate that there is a single copy of the TP2 gene in the mouse genome and Northern blots demonstrate that the polyadenylated TP2 mRNA is present at high and essentially equal levels in early and late haploid cells, and that it is virtually absent from meiotic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1592225508,"Cartilage proteoglycan aggregates contain two components (proteoglycan monomer and link protein) which interact with each other and with hyaluronic acid. Data from amino acid sequence analysis are presented that shows that a domain of the proteoglycan, the hyaluronic acid binding region, which interacts with link protein and hyaluronic acid is very similar to link protein in terms of its primary structure. However, the pattern of glycosylation in the hyaluronic acid binding region is different from that found in link protein. After removal of N-linked oligosaccharides, the tryptically prepared hyaluronic acid binding region from rat chondrosarcoma has a mass by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of 43 +/- 2 kDa. The COOH-terminal two-thirds of rat chondrosarcoma link protein, starting at residue 105, has 41.3% identity with a similar region in the hyaluronic acid binding region. We show that, in addition to the hyaluronic acid binding region, proteoglycan contains another region with similarity to the two repeating loop structures in the COOH-terminal two-thirds of link protein. This presumably corresponds to the second globular domain reported in rotary shadowing studies of cartilage proteoglycans. We have deduced the positions of all of the disulfide bonds in the hyaluronic acid binding region and find them to be in the same positions as would be expected from comparison of these sequences with link protein."

In contrast, the anterior lobe contained, in addition to traces of alpha-amidated gastrin (2 pmol/g), hundredfold higher amounts of a nonamidated progastrin (189 pmol/g; Mr approximately 7000) and two nonamidated procholecystokinin fragments (75 pmol/g; Mr approximately 7000 and 5000). These results show that hormone genes, in spite of translation of their mRNA, are not necessarily expressed in functional peptides in cells outside the principal production regions. Hence, the study indicates that differentiation of endocrine cells may be controlled at the post-translational level."
https://openalex.org/W1903719516,"Glucocorticoid receptors were isolated by immunoadsorption from cytosol of L cells that were cultured for 18 h in the presence of [32P]orthophosphate, and the phosphorylation state of the receptor was examined before and after transformation to the DNA-binding state. Temperature-mediated transformation of the glucocorticoid receptor under cell-free conditions results in no change in receptor size or degree of phosphorylation. When cytosol containing transformed receptors is incubated with DNA-cellulose, 30-50% of the receptors are able to bind to DNA and the remainder do not bind to DNA. Both the heated receptors that bind to DNA and the receptors that do not bind to DNA are phosphorylated to the same degree. When intact cells containing 32P-labeled receptors are incubated for 2 h at 0 degree C with triamcinolone acetonide and then for 20 min at 37 degrees C in the presence of the hormone, 80% of the receptor becomes tightly associated with the nucleus in a manner that is both temperature-dependent and ligand-dependent. Approximately 80% of the nuclear-bound receptor is extracted with 0.4 M NaCl. Both the cytosolic receptor from cells incubated at 0 degree C and the salt-extracted nuclear receptor from cells incubated at 37 degrees C have been resolved by immunoadsorption to protein A-Sepharose with the BuGR1 monoclonal antibody and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by immunoblotting and autoradiography of the immunoblots. In addition, direct measurements of the amounts of 32P contained per unit of receptor protein were performed for receptors transformed both in the intact cell and in cell-free lysates. The results demonstrate that the untransformed receptor and the nuclear-bound transformed receptor are labeled with 32P to the same extent."
https://openalex.org/W1502467522,"We have isolated an almost full length cDNA to transferrin from a mouse mammary tumor virus-induced tumor cDNA library. On Northern blots of RNA isolated from liver and mammary glands, the cDNA hybridized to a single band of 2.4 kilobases. The authenticity of the probe is shown further by 83% sequence homology to human cDNA and identical amino acid sequence to a small cDNA probe isolated from a mouse liver library. The level of transferrin mRNA is very low in the glands from virgin mice, but is as abundant in the glands from pregnant and lactating mice as in the liver. We further show that the steady-state transferrin mRNA level in culture is relatively insensitive to lactogenic hormones compared to that of beta-casein mRNA. Culturing the cells on extracellular matrix, however, markedly affects its expression. These findings raise the possibility that the composition of the basement membrane in the mammary gland may play a role in regulation of transferrin levels in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1602746521,"An enzyme fraction, isolated from crude extracts of the fungus Tolypocladium inflatum, strain 7939/F, is able to synthesize the undecapeptide cyclosporin A. The formation of cyclosporin A was monitored by incorporation of the radiolabeled constituent amino acids of cyclosporin A or by using S-adenosyl-L-[14C-methyl] methionine. The structure of cyclosporin A, synthesized enzymatically in vitro, was confirmed by chromatographic comparison with the authentic compound and by amino acid analyses. Replacement of L-2-aminobutyric acid in the reaction mixture by L-alanine, L-threonine, L-valine, or L-norvaline yields the naturally occurring cyclosporins B, C, D, and G. Also, D-alanine could be replaced by D-serine to yield [D-Ser8]cyclosporin A."
https://openalex.org/W1512869765,"Angiotensin II (ANG II) evoked a rapid efflux of 45Ca2+ which was largely, but not completely, prevented by the removal of extracellular Na+. ANG II had little, if any, effect on a fast component of 45Ca2+ uptake, although the hormone increased a slow component of 45Ca2+ uptake by 2.5-fold. ANG II decreased total cell Ca2+ by about 40% within 1 min of hormone addition. The replacement of extracellular Na+ with N-methyl-D-glucamine or K+ nearly prevented ANG II from decreasing total cell Ca2+. ANG II caused a 5-fold increase in free Ca2+ which reached a peak about 10 s after hormone addition. Free Ca2+ decreased rapidly from the peak to a plateau phase which lasted for several min. Free Ca2+ during the plateau phase was about 1.5 times the basal level. Removing extracellular Na+ caused a more than 2-fold increase in the free Ca2+ concentration that was maintained during the plateau phase, and Na+, added during the plateau phase, rapidly decreased free Ca2+. These findings suggest that the transient nature of the increase in free Ca2+ produced by ANG II is due in part to a net efflux of Ca2+ which is largely dependent on external Na+ and probably mediated by Na+/Ca2+ exchange."

Hatched birds displayed normal motor behavior for about 5 to 7 weeks, whereupon they developed a neurological syndrome; in the grafted spinal cord the pathological signs of the disease were very similar to those of the active plaques of multiple sclerosis and of the lesions of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis and neuritis, including la expression by brain capillary endothelia, rupture of the blood-brain barrier, leukocytic infiltration in the nervous tissue, and demyelination. In the animals at the most advanced stage of the disease an autoimmune attack occurred on the host's nervous system with the same histopathological signs."

https://openalex.org/W1587880344,"The ciliate protozoan Paramecium tetraurelia produces secretory granules (trichocysts) which release needle-like structures composed of small, acidic proteins. Using antibodies against isolated chromogranin A (CGA) and against trichocyst proteins, we found cross-reactive proteins in chromaffin granules and trichocysts. Four independently derived sera against isolated CGA stained bands of the Mr 15,000-25,000 family of trichocyst proteins on immunoblots. A positive response was also obtained with antiserum against chemically synthesized peptides (PL26 and GE25) corresponding to defined regions of the CGA amino acid sequence. In extracts of whole Paramecium, larger proteins (Mr 53,000 and 49,000) also reacted with antibodies against CGA and the related synthetic peptides. These larger proteins may represent unprocessed precursors to the smaller proteins of mature trichocysts. Antiserum to trichocysts recognized CGA in chromaffin granule lysates. Further evidence of a Paramecium protein related to CGA was provided by hybridization of Paramecium mRNA with cloned cDNA for bovine CGA. Our results suggest striking conservation in evolution of CGA-like proteins that may play some role, as yet unknown, in secretion."

The I50 for inhibition of 3-O-methylglucose transport in red blood cells by IAPS-forskolin was found to be 0.05 microM. The carrier free radioiodinated label is a highly specific photoaffinity label for the human erythrocyte glucose transporter. Photolysis of erythrocyte membranes (ghosts) and purified glucose transporter preparations with 1-2 nM [125I]IAPS-forskolin and analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed specific derivatization of a broad band with an apparent molecular mass of 40-70 kDa. Photoincorporation into erythrocyte membranes using 2 nM [125I]IAPS-forskolin was protected with D-glucose (I50 400 mM), cytochalasin B (I50 0.5 microM), and forskolin (I50 10 microM). No protection was observed with L-glucose (600 mM). Endo-beta-galactosidase digestion of [125I] IAPS-forskolin-labeled ghosts and purified transporter resulted in a dramatic sharpening of the specifically radiolabeled transporter to 40 kDa. Trypsinization of [125I]IAPS-forskolin-labeled ghosts and purified transporter reduced the specifically radiolabeled transporter to a sharp peak at 18 kDa. [125I]IAPS-forskolin will be a useful tool to study the structural aspects of the glucose transporter."
https://openalex.org/W1605640867,"12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), a tumor promoter and potent activator of protein kinase C, stimulates [3H]choline incorporation into phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) in NG108-15 cells (Liscovitch, M., Freese, A., Blusztajn, J. K. and Wurtman, R. J. (1986) J. Neurochem. 47, 1936-1941). In the present study we demonstrate that two cell-permeant diacylglycerols, sn-1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol and sn-1,2-dioctanoylglycerol, also stimulate [3H]choline incorporation into PtdCho. However, the effect of diacylglycerol is additional to that produced by a maximally effective concentration of TPA (0.5 microM), suggesting that the two agents may not act via the same mechanism. In addition, the protein kinase inhibitor 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine dihydrochloride (at 200 microM) inhibits the action of TPA by 59% while not affecting that of diacylglycerol. Finally, preincubation of the cells with TPA (0.1 microM) for 24 h reduces protein kinase C activity in the cells and completely abolishes the effect of additional TPA on choline incorporation. In contrast, diacylglycerol-induced stimulation of PtdCho biosynthesis was not inhibited in the cells that were desensitized to TPA. These results suggest that the effect of the two cell-permeant diacylglycerols on PtdCho biosynthesis either is not mediated by protein kinase C activation, or, is mediated by a TPA-insensitive isoenzyme of protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1508222222,"Carp Hb undergoes a well known change in kinetics over the pH range 6-9. X-ray absorption spectroscopy, in conjunction with refined data analysis procedures, shows no difference in iron-ligand distances when carp HbCO is switched from R (high affinity) to T (low affinity) states. These distances are 2.015 +/- 0.015 A for the average iron-pyrrole nitrogen distance, 2.14 +/- 0.04 A for the iron-nitrogen (of histidine) distance, and 1.89 +/- 0.05 A for the Fe-C (of CO) distance. Examination of the region from 30 to 100 eV above the threshold, called the ligand field indicator region, reveals spectral differences, which when compared to model compounds suggest that the iron and the heme are less coplanar in the T-like forms. These results are consistent with the iron being 0.1 A more out of the mean heme plane in both carp HbCO and carp Hb T states, relative to the R forms, and that the change in iron position on ligation to either T or R state is four times larger than that occurring with the quaternary switch."
https://openalex.org/W2062379045,"The transcription factor of the 5S RNA gene, TFIIIA, induces gyration of oocyte- and somatic-type 5S DNA plasmids in Xenopus oocyte extracts, but oocyte 5S gyration requires a 5-fold higher TFIIIA concentration than somatic 5S gyration. Concomitant with the differential gyration at intermediate TFIIIA concentrations, the oocyte genes are repressed and the somatic genes become activated, a situation that mimics the one seen in Xenopus somatic cells. Data obtained with plasmids immobilized in agarose indicate that TFIIIA finds its site via a DNA-mediated transfer mechanism, and that all-or-none gyration is a consequence of TFIIIA transfer between 5S DNA sites. Based on these results, we present a model that explains the differential all-or-none activation of the 5S RNA genes."
https://openalex.org/W1598259278,"Natural abundance carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectra (67.9 MHz) were obtained for native nucleosome cores: cores dissociated in 2 M NaCl and 2 M NaCl, 6 M urea; and cores degraded with DNase I plus proteinase K. Phosphorus-31 NMR spectra of native and dissociated cores and core length DNA were also obtained at 60.7 MHz. The 31P resonance and spin-lattice relaxation time (T1) of DNA were only slightly affected by packaging in nucleosome cores, in agreement with other reports, but 13C resonances of DNA were essentially unobservable. The loss of DNA spectral intensity suggests that rapid internal motions of DNA sugar carbons in protein-free DNA previously demonstrated by 13C NMR methods are partly restricted in nucleosomes. The 13C spectrum of native cores contains many narrow intense resonances assigned to lysine side chain and alpha-carbons, glycine alpha-carbons, alanine alpha- and beta- carbons, and arginine side chain carbons. Several weaker resonances were also assigned. The narrow line widths, short T1 values, and non-minimal nuclear Overhauser enhancements of these resonances, including alpha- and beta-carbons, show that some terminal chain segments of histones in nucleosomes are as mobile as small random coil polypeptides. The mobile segments include about 9% of all histone residues and 25% of all lysines, but only 10% of all arginines. The compositions of these segments indicate that mobile regions are located in amino- or carboxyl-terminal sequences of two or more histones. In addition, high mobility was observed for side chain carbons of 45-50% of all lysines (delta and epsilon carbons) and about 25% of all arginines (zeta carbon) in histones (including those in mobile segments), suggesting that basic residues in terminal histone sequences are not strongly involved in nucleosome structure and may instead help stabilize higher order chromatin structure."
https://openalex.org/W5874098,"We have used 8-methoxypsoralen to probe the chromatin structure of mammalian cells in situ while they repair pyrimidine dimers or bulky lesions in DNA. We observed that excision repair of these DNA lesions is accompanied by periodic alterations of chromatin organization. In parallel, fluctuations of the rates of repair patch synthesis accompanied these structural changes. Taking advantage of the accessibility of free DNA domains for psoralen intercalation, we have developed a technique to quantitatively isolate the micrococcal nuclease-sensitive, free DNA fraction of native bulk chromatin. We have determined the location of newly synthesized repair patches relative to free DNA domains as a function of repair time. Extensive rearrangements of repair patches from these domains into micrococcal nuclease-resistant DNA were observed. Our results indicate that periodic changes of chromatin organization associated with rearrangement of repair patches accompany the process of excision repair in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W1574027562,"Since it was established that phorbol esters bind to and activate protein kinase C, a proposed mechanism of action for these compounds has been the phosphorylation of specific protein substrates (Niedel, J. E., Kuhn, L. J., and Vandenbark, G. R. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80, 36-40; Castagna, M., Takai, Y., Kaibuchi, K., Sano, K., Kikkawa, U., and Nishizuka, Y. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 7847-7851). To better understand this proposed relationship, we investigated the ability of a series of phorbol esters to elicit lysosomal enzyme release (LER) and specific substrate phosphorylation in human monocytes. In this system, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate stimulated the secretion of the lysosomal enzyme N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase in both a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, the ability of a series of phorbol esters to stimulate LER was characterized and found to be in good agreement with the relative order of these compounds to stimulate the phosphorylation of four endogenous protein substrates. Phorbol ester-stimulated protein phosphorylation was examined in intact cell preparations and found to be concentration and structure-dependent. The phosphoproteins (pp) were designated pp28, pp55, pp61, and pp66 corresponding to their molecular masses in kilodaltons. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that phorbol ester-mediated effects are the result of protein kinase C activation and subsequent protein phosphorylation. Finally, opsonized zymosan was found to elicit a concentration-dependent stimulation of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase release similar in magnitude and time course to phorbol ester-stimulated LER. Opsonized zymosan also stimulated the phosphorylation of two phosphoproteins (pp61 and pp66) in a concentration-dependent manner. Specific phosphorylation of pp61 and pp66 by both secretagogues, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and opsonized zymosan, suggests these two proteins may be key to the functional response of LER in human monocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1578846821,"RNA polymerase II-specific transcription requires, in addition to auxiliary protein factors, the hydrolysis of the beta-gamma phosphate bond of ATP. The nonhydrolyzable analog of ATP, imidoadenosine triphosphate does not suffice for specific in vitro transcription (Bunick, D., Zandomeni, R., Ackerman, S., and Weinmann, R. (1982) Cell 29, 877-886), although it can be incorporated into RNA. The experiments presented here suggest two energy-dependent steps in RNA polymerase II transcription. One of these steps is required at, or close to, the point of initiation, as determined by 5' end primer extension analysis. In vitro transcription occurs efficiently in vitro when imidoadenosine triphosphate is supplemented with dATP to fulfill the energy requirement. In the presence both of imidoadenosine triphosphate and imidoguanosine triphosphate, the concentration of dATP required for transcription initiation is dramatically increased. This suggests that ATP and GTP are co-substrates in transcription initiation, supporting the role of protein kinase II in this process (Zandomeni, R., Zandomeni, M. C., Shugar, D., and Weinmann, R. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 3414-3419). The concentration of dATP required for maximal initiation is inadequate for the production of full-length transcripts, suggesting a second energy-dependent step in the RNA elongation process. Since the elongation step is unaffected by the presence of imidoguanosine triphosphate, GTP beta-gamma phosphate bond hydrolysis appears to be required only for initiation."
https://openalex.org/W1561353576,"Two receptor sites for [3H]piretanide, a sulfamoylbenzoic acid loop diuretic, have been identified in intact Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, an epithelial cell line derived from dog kidney. The two receptor sites differed in their affinity for piretanide (KD1 = 2.1 +/- 1.4 nM and KD2 = 264 +/- 88 nM) and the maximal number of sites (Bmax1 = 11 +/- 4 and Bmax2 = 120 +/- 80 fmol/mg of protein). Madin-Darby canine kidney cells are known to possess a tightly coupled and highly cooperative Na+,K+,Cl- cotransporter which is sensitive to loop diuretics. Under ionic conditions identical to those used to study piretanide binding (30 mM Na+, 30 mM K+, 30 mM Cl-), the Ki for inhibition of the initial rate of 86Rb+ uptake by piretanide was 333 +/- 92 nM, a value not significantly different from the KD of the low affinity receptor site. [3H]Piretanide binding to three low K+-resistant mutants derived from this cell line was also studied. These mutants had been previously characterized as being partially or completely defective in Na+,K+,Cl- cotransport activity (McRoberts, J. A., Tran, C. T., and Saier, M. H., Jr. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 12320-12326). One of these mutants had undetectable levels of Na+,K+,Cl- cotransport activity and low to undetectable levels of specific piretanide binding. The second mutant had low but measurable levels of cotransport activity (11% of the wild-type levels) and displayed very low affinity (KD approximately 8000 nM) specific piretanide binding. In the third mutant, expression of Na+,K+,Cl- cotransport activity and both piretanide receptors was cell density-dependent. Subconfluent to just-confluent cultures of this mutant lacked detectable cotransport activity as well as specific piretanide binding, whereas very dense cultures displayed both piretanide receptors and had intermediate to nearly normal levels of cotransport activity. These results demonstrate that the Na+,K+,Cl- cotransporter is a receptor for loop diuretics, but they also raise questions about the functional significance of the two piretanide receptor sites."
https://openalex.org/W1535109552,"We report here the isolation and DNA sequence of a cDNA clone encoding a 252-amino acid non-muscle or cytoskeletal tropomyosin (cTm) isoform from Drosophila. The Drosophila cTm shows considerable homology with vertebrate cTm throughout the middle portion of the molecule. The amino-terminal end of the molecule, however, shows less homology and contains five more amino acids than the equine platelet and human tropomyosins. There is also a proline at position 6 in the Drosophila protein. The carboxyl-terminal 27 amino acids also show little homology with vertebrate non-muscle tropomyosins. This is a region of the molecule that shows considerably diversity among other Drosophila tropomyosins and vertebrate tropomyosins. A comparison of the DNA sequence of the cTm cDNA and a previously reported muscle tropomyosin II cDNA sequence shows regions of identical DNA sequence alternating with regions of nonidentical sequence, suggesting that both mRNAs are produced by alternate splicing of the same gene."
https://openalex.org/W1518764385,"The lipid transfer protein complex (LTC) isolated from human plasma by immunoaffinity chromatography transfers cholesteryl esters (CE), triglycerides, and phosphatidylcholine (PC) between lipoproteins in vitro. The molecular weight of this lipid transfer catalyst in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels was 65,000. When resolved on a gel filtration column by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), LTC was composed of fractions of high (greater than 150,000) to low (18,000) molecular weight, although sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of each fraction revealed bands at Mr 65,000 (major) and 52,000 (minor). The CE and triglyceride transfer activity of the low Mr HPLC fraction (1049 nmol of triglyceride/mg/h and 244 nmol of CE/mg/h) was significantly greater than that of the high Mr HPLC fraction (15-27 nmol of triglyceride/mg/h and 20-30 nmol of CE/mg/h). The PC transfer activity of the HPLC fractions was not determined. LTC proteins were separated by dialysis in acidified chloroform:methanol solution into dialysand and dialysate proteins. The dialysate contained a low Mr proteolipid, designated the catalytic domain Cd, which catalyzed CE and triglyceride transfer at equivalent rates (11.0 versus 9.5 mumol/mg/h, respectively). PC transfer activity was approximately 10% of these levels (1.5 mumol/mg/h). The dialysand consisted of a protein, designated the transfer protein TP, which facilitated CE (3.4 mumol/mg/h) preferentially over triglyceride and PC (1.0 mumol/mg/h) transfer, and a catalytically inactive protein, designated the heparin-binding domain Hd. We propose a model of the LTC protein (based on catalytic activities, monoclonal antibody reactivities, and heparin-binding capacities of the isolated proteins) in which both Hd (approximately 13 kDa) and Cd (approximately 3 kDa) originate from a single lipid transfer protein, TP."
https://openalex.org/W2154222583,"The oxidation-reduction midpoint potential for the heme prosthetic group present in assimilatory nitrate reductase from Chlorella vulgaris has been determined by optical potentiometric titrations in the presence of dye mediators. At pH 7, the midpoint potential was determined to be -160 mV and corresponds to a reversible n = 1 redox process. The midpoint potential was unaltered by the use of NADH as reductant, unaffected by the presence of NAD+, cytochrome c, phosphate, cyanide, or alkaline pH. In addition, the redox potential of the heme was independent of modifications to the enzyme such as substitution of the molybdenum center with tungsten, or cleavage and separation of the enzyme into its flavin and heme/molybdenum domains. In contrast, the midpoint potential increased on decreasing the pH yielding a pH dependence of approximately 20 mV/pH unit within the range 5.5 to 7, suggesting the presence of a single, redox-associated, ionizable functional group on the protein with pKox = 5.8 and pKred = 6.1. At pH 7 and within the range 12 to 38 degrees C, the midpoint potential of the heme decreased by approximately 1 mV/degree. Values for delta S0 and delta H0 were calculated to be -25.6 e.u. and -4.0 kcal/mol."

We labeled proteins in vivo by microinjection of radioactive amino acids into individual R14 neurons. The labeled peptides were fractionated by high performance liquid chromatography and subjected to Edman degradation, thus enabling us to determine post-translational processing sites. Cleavage of the signal sequence was observed and at two internal sites. Cleavage at these internal sites occurs at basic amino acids and results in three products, a 2.9-, a 4.9-, and a 1.4-kDa peptide.
