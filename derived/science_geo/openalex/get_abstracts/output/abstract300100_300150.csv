https://openalex.org/W1974423175,Samples of marine plankton collected in high-latitude areas of the South Atlantic where surface water temperatures are near 0 degrees C show a carbon-12 enrichment of 6 per mill relative to samples collected where temperatures are about 25 degrees C. The organic carbon in sediments in the Drake Passage and Argentine Basin also shows a carbon-12 enrichment relative to warmer areas.
https://openalex.org/W2072431686,"A series of Cretaceous mammal faunas, beginning with standard late Cretaceous faunas and continuing with three of Paleocene aspect, are summarized. Four families (Eucosmodontidae, Taeniolabididae, Leptictidae, Arctocyonidae) and one order (Condylarthra) of Tertiary mammals are extended into the Cretaceous. New genera Cimexomys, Stygimys, Procerberus, and Protungulatum are described, as is a small species of Catopsalis. The skeleton of a multituberculate is restored and multituberculate classification is revised."
https://openalex.org/W2090544109,"The presence of Miocene mammals of North American affinity in the Panama Canal Zone indicates that Central America was attached to North America. That this attachment was a broad and stable land mass is shown by the close relation of the Panama Miocene herbivores to the widely distributed Miocene herbivore fauna of North America. A continuous connection existed probably throughout the Tertiary, to the west and north of the isthmian region, but the tectonically active isthmus probably was broken up into an archipelago during most of Tertiary time. Between the islands ran the Strait of Panama; from time to time parts of the isthmian area were connected to the stable land to the west, allowing eastward migration of land animals. The mammals of North American affinity in the Cucaracha Formation were found only a few kilometers from the western end of the San Blas Area, a stable land mass in eastern Panama that was separated from South America by the Bolivar Trough during most of the interval between Oligocene and Pliocene time (16). The Strait of Panama was a less stable barrier than the Bolivar Trough; this being so, it is likely that the San Blas Area was inhabited by land animals of North American rather than South American affinity. Thus, the disappearance of the Bolivar seaway in Pliocene time would have allowed, probably for the first time, mingling of the North and South American mammal faunas."

https://openalex.org/W2041849268,"Nonriparian woodlands occur on escarpments and other topographic breaks throughout the grassland province of central North America. Grassland vegetation is mainly correlated with gently sloping or flat terrain mantled by deep, transported soils of Pleistocene or younger age. Paleobotanical evidence suggests that extensive treeless grasslands may be a relatively recent development on the plains. Interaction of topography, wind, and fire may partly account for the observed distribution of vegetation."
https://openalex.org/W1979454560,"The low-density cubic form of silica (impure), melanophlogite, has a clathrate-type structure that incorporates organic molecules, including long straight-chain hydrocarbons. The structure is analogous to that of the clathrate crystalline hydrates of composition 6X.46H(2)O or 8X.46H(2)O. This is the first known example of a silicate framework structure with the pentagonal dodecahedron as a framework element."

https://openalex.org/W1976984573,"The frequency of polyploidy in the angiosperm flora of the Ogotoruk Creek-Cape Thompson area of northwestern Alaska is correlated with edaphic environmental gradients in the area. These results, when placed in a historical and ecological context, help to clarify the problem of increasing frequency of polyploidy with latitude in the northern hemisphere."

https://openalex.org/W2030495191,"Peat discovered below drift near Titusville, Pennsylvania, formerly called ""inner Illinoian,"" has a carbon-14 age of 31,400 +/- 2,100 years. The overlying drift, herein named Titusville Till, is therefore not Illinoian but is ""late early Wisconsinan"" or late Altonian of the Lake Michigan lobe classification."

https://openalex.org/W1979070387,"The crystal structure of 9,9,10,10-tetrachloroanthracene has been determined by x-ray analysis. The structure is characterized by dovetailed packing of crystallographically independent molecules. The anthracene skeletons are planar, and the molecules have approximately D(2h) symmetry. Bond distances and angles are summarized and the stereochemical implications of the results are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2077517757,"THE object of this paper is, first, to show the present status of affiliation of schools or departments engaged respectively in the training of physicians and of teachers, and secondly, to present a plea for a more general and effective cooperation between medical and educational departments where the interchange is warranted by technical training and material resources in both departments. Herein we are concerned particularly with the training of teachers pursuing at least a four years' course in a good college or university department of education and also, on the medical side, with the supplementing of the training of prospective physicians who intend to participate in the work of the schools."
