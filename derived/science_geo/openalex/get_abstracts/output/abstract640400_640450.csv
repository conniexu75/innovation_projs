https://openalex.org/W2975196800,"Damage-induced long non-coding RNAs (dilncRNA) synthesized at DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by RNA polymerase II are necessary for DNA-damage-response (DDR) focus formation. We demonstrate that induction of DSBs results in the assembly of functional promoters that include a complete RNA polymerase II preinitiation complex, MED1 and CDK9. Absence or inactivation of these factors causes a reduction in DDR foci both in vivo and in an in vitro system that reconstitutes DDR events on nucleosomes. We also show that dilncRNAs drive molecular crowding of DDR proteins, such as 53BP1, into foci that exhibit liquid–liquid phase-separation condensate properties. We propose that the assembly of DSB-induced transcriptional promoters drives RNA synthesis, which stimulates phase separation of DDR factors in the shape of foci. Pessina et al. report that DNA damage induces the assembly of a functional promoter at double-strand breaks and the transcribed RNAs promote phase separation of damage-response factors such as 53BP1."
https://openalex.org/W2977079874,"A hallmark of the immune system is the interplay among specialized cell types transitioning between resting and stimulated states. The gene regulatory landscape of this dynamic system has not been fully characterized in human cells. Here we collected assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) and RNA sequencing data under resting and stimulated conditions for up to 32 immune cell populations. Stimulation caused widespread chromatin remodeling, including response elements shared between stimulated B and T cells. Furthermore, several autoimmune traits showed significant heritability in stimulation-responsive elements from distinct cell types, highlighting the importance of these cell states in autoimmunity. Allele-specific read mapping identified variants that alter chromatin accessibility in particular conditions, allowing us to observe evidence of function for a candidate causal variant that is undetected by existing large-scale studies in resting cells. Our results provide a resource of chromatin dynamics and highlight the need to characterize the effects of genetic variation in stimulated cells. Analysis of gene expression and open chromatin regions in up to 32 immune cell populations under resting and stimulated conditions identifies widespread chromatin remodeling and shared response elements between stimulated B and T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2976898289,"Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) brings comprehensive insights to cancer genome interpretation. To explore the clinical value of WGS, we sequenced 254 triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) for which associated treatment and outcome data were collected between 2010 and 2015 via the population-based Sweden Cancerome Analysis Network–Breast (SCAN-B) project (ClinicalTrials.gov ID:NCT02306096). Applying the HRDetect mutational-signature-based algorithm to classify tumors, 59% were predicted to have homologous-recombination-repair deficiency (HRDetect-high): 67% explained by germline/somatic mutations of BRCA1/BRCA2, BRCA1 promoter hypermethylation, RAD51C hypermethylation or biallelic loss of PALB2. A novel mechanism of BRCA1 abrogation was discovered via germline SINE-VNTR-Alu retrotransposition. HRDetect provided independent prognostic information, with HRDetect-high patients having better outcome on adjuvant chemotherapy for invasive disease-free survival (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.42; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.2–0.87) and distant relapse-free interval (HR = 0.31, CI = 0.13–0.76) compared to HRDetect-low, regardless of whether a genetic/epigenetic cause was identified. HRDetect-intermediate, some possessing potentially targetable biological abnormalities, had the poorest outcomes. HRDetect-low cancers also had inadequate outcomes: ~4.7% were mismatch-repair-deficient (another targetable defect, not typically sought) and they were enriched for (but not restricted to) PIK3CA/AKT1 pathway abnormalities. New treatment options need to be considered for now-discernible HRDetect-intermediate and HRDetect-low categories. This population-based study advocates for WGS of TNBC to better inform trial stratification and improve clinical decision-making. Whole-genome sequencing in triple-negative breast cancer supports the prognostic value of the HRDetect mutational-signature-based algorithm for improving patient stratification in a real-world, population-based clinical diagnostic setting."
https://openalex.org/W2976525441,"The large-scale genetic profiling of tumours can identify potentially actionable molecular variants for which approved anticancer drugs are available1–3. However, when patients with such variants are treated with drugs outside of their approved label, successes and failures of targeted therapy are not systematically collected or shared. We therefore initiated the Drug Rediscovery protocol, an adaptive, precision-oncology trial that aims to identify signals of activity in cohorts of patients, with defined tumour types and molecular variants, who are being treated with anticancer drugs outside of their approved label. To be eligible for the trial, patients have to have exhausted or declined standard therapies, and have malignancies with potentially actionable variants for which no approved anticancer drugs are available. Here we show an overall rate of clinical benefit—defined as complete or partial response, or as stable disease beyond 16 weeks—of 34% in 215 treated patients, comprising 136 patients who received targeted therapies and 79 patients who received immunotherapy. The overall median duration of clinical benefit was 9 months (95% confidence interval of 8–11 months), including 26 patients who were experiencing ongoing clinical benefit at data cut-off. The potential of the Drug Rediscovery protocol is illustrated by the identification of a successful cohort of patients with microsatellite instable tumours who received nivolumab (clinical benefit rate of 63%), and a cohort of patients with colorectal cancer with relatively low mutational load who experienced only limited clinical benefit from immunotherapy. The Drug Rediscovery protocol facilitates the defined use of approved drugs beyond their labels in rare subgroups of cancer, identifies early signals of activity in these subgroups, accelerates the clinical translation of new insights into the use of anticancer drugs outside of their approved label, and creates a publicly available repository of knowledge for future decision-making. Clinical benefit was observed in 34% of a cohort of 215 patients with cancer who received treatment with anticancer drugs outside of their approved label, in the Drug Rediscovery protocol trial."

https://openalex.org/W2975543744,"Recent work examining astrocytic physiology centers on fluorescence imaging, due to development of sensitive fluorescent indicators and observation of spatiotemporally complex calcium activity. However, the field remains hindered in characterizing these dynamics, both within single cells and at the population level, because of the insufficiency of current region-of-interest-based approaches to describe activity that is often spatially unfixed, size-varying and propagative. Here we present an analytical framework that releases astrocyte biologists from region-of-interest-based tools. The Astrocyte Quantitative Analysis (AQuA) software takes an event-based perspective to model and accurately quantify complex calcium and neurotransmitter activity in fluorescence imaging datasets. We apply AQuA to a range of ex vivo and in vivo imaging data and use physiologically relevant parameters to comprehensively describe the data. Since AQuA is data-driven and based on machine learning principles, it can be applied across model organisms, fluorescent indicators, experimental modes, and imaging resolutions and speeds, enabling researchers to elucidate fundamental neural physiology."

https://openalex.org/W2975526474,"RNA modifications are emerging as key determinants of gene expression. However, compelling genetic demonstrations of their relevance to human disease are lacking. Here, we link ribosomal RNA 2'-O-methylation (2'-O-Me) to the etiology of dyskeratosis congenita. We identify nucleophosmin (NPM1) as an essential regulator of 2'-O-Me on rRNA by directly binding C/D box small nucleolar RNAs, thereby modulating translation. We demonstrate the importance of 2'-O-Me-regulated translation for cellular growth, differentiation and hematopoietic stem cell maintenance, and show that Npm1 inactivation in adult hematopoietic stem cells results in bone marrow failure. We identify NPM1 germline mutations in patients with dyskeratosis congenita presenting with bone marrow failure and demonstrate that they are deficient in small nucleolar RNA binding. Mice harboring a dyskeratosis congenita germline Npm1 mutation recapitulate both hematological and nonhematological features of dyskeratosis congenita. Thus, our findings indicate that impaired 2'-O-Me can be etiological to human disease."
https://openalex.org/W2976985562,"When making decisions we often face the need to adjudicate between conflicting strategies or courses of action. Our ability to understand the neuronal processes underlying conflict processing is limited on the one hand by the spatiotemporal resolution of functional MRI and, on the other hand, by imperfect cross-species homologies in animal model systems. Here we examine the responses of single neurons and local field potentials in human neurosurgical patients in two prefrontal regions critical to controlled decision-making, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). While we observe typical modest conflict-related firing rate effects, we find a widespread effect of conflict on spike-phase coupling in the dACC and on driving spike-field coherence in the dlPFC. These results support the hypothesis that a cross-areal rhythmic neuronal coordination is intrinsic to cognitive control in response to conflict, and provide new evidence to support the hypothesis that conflict processing involves modulation of the dlPFC by the dACC. Using intracranial recordings in humans, the authors found decision conflict-related effects on firing rate in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), on spike-phase coupling in the dACC, and on spike-field coherence in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2976629614,"Phosphoinositides have a pivotal role in the maturation of nascent phagosomes into microbicidal phagolysosomes. Following degradation of their contents, mature phagolysosomes undergo resolution, a process that remains largely uninvestigated. Here we studied the role of phosphoinositides in phagolysosome resolution. Phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PtdIns(4)P), which is abundant in maturing phagolysosomes, was depleted as they tubulated and resorbed. Depletion was caused, in part, by transfer of phagolysosomal PtdIns(4)P to the endoplasmic reticulum, a process mediated by oxysterol-binding protein-related protein 1L (ORP1L), a RAB7 effector. ORP1L formed discrete tethers between the phagolysosome and the endoplasmic reticulum, resulting in distinct regions with alternating PtdIns(4)P depletion and enrichment. Tubules emerged from PtdIns(4)P-rich regions, where ADP-ribosylation factor-like protein 8B (ARL8B) and SifA- and kinesin-interacting protein/pleckstrin homology domain-containing family M member 2 (SKIP/PLEKHM2) accumulated. SKIP binds preferentially to monophosphorylated phosphoinositides, of which PtdIns(4)P is most abundant in phagolysosomes, contributing to their tubulation. Accordingly, premature hydrolysis of PtdIns(4)P impaired SKIP recruitment and phagosome resolution. Thus, resolution involves phosphoinositides and tethering of phagolysosomes to the endoplasmic reticulum. Levin-Konigsberg et al. show that resorption of the phagolysosome after degradation of its contents requires transfer of PI4P and tethering to the ER, both mediated by oxysterol-binding protein-related protein 1L (ORP1L)."
https://openalex.org/W2975116489,"Abstract Domestication of clonally propagated crops such as pineapple from South America was hypothesized to be a ‘one-step operation’. We sequenced the genome of Ananas comosus var. bracteatus CB5 and assembled 513 Mb into 25 chromosomes with 29,412 genes. Comparison of the genomes of CB5, F153 and MD2 elucidated the genomic basis of fiber production, color formation, sugar accumulation and fruit maturation. We also resequenced 89 Ananas genomes. Cultivars ‘Smooth Cayenne’ and ‘Queen’ exhibited ancient and recent admixture, while ‘Singapore Spanish’ supported a one-step operation of domestication. We identified 25 selective sweeps, including a strong sweep containing a pair of tandemly duplicated bromelain inhibitors. Four candidate genes for self-incompatibility were linked in F153, but were not functional in self-compatible CB5. Our findings support the coexistence of sexual recombination and a one-step operation in the domestication of clonally propagated crops. This work guides the exploration of sexual and asexual domestication trajectories in other clonally propagated crops."
https://openalex.org/W2979228093,"The coastal zones of Small Island States are hotspots of human habitation and economic endeavour. In the Pacific region, as elsewhere, there are large gaps in understandings of the exposure and vulnerability of people in coastal zones. The 22 Pacific Countries and Territories (PICTs) are poorly represented in global analyses of vulnerability to seaward risks. We combine several data sources to estimate populations to zones 1, 5 and 10 km from the coastline in each of the PICTs. Regional patterns in the proximity of Pacific people to the coast are dominated by Papua New Guinea. Overall, ca. half the population of the Pacific resides within 10 km of the coast but this jumps to 97% when Papua New Guinea is excluded. A quarter of Pacific people live within 1 km of the coast, but without PNG this increases to slightly more than half. Excluding PNG, 90% of Pacific Islanders live within 5 km of the coast. All of the population in the coral atoll nations of Tokelau and Tuvalu live within a km of the ocean. Results using two global datasets, the SEDAC-CIESIN Gridded Population of the World v4 (GPWv4) and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Landscan differed: Landscan under-dispersed population, overestimating numbers in urban centres and underestimating population in rural areas and GPWv4 over-dispersed the population. In addition to errors introduced by the allocation models of the two methods, errors were introduced as artefacts of allocating households to 1 km x 1 km grid cell data (30 arc–seconds) to polygons. The limited utility of LandScan and GPWv4 in advancing this analysis may be overcome with more spatially resolved census data and the inclusion of elevation above sea level as an important dimension of vulnerability."
https://openalex.org/W2975720390,"Electronic band structures dictate the mechanical, optical and electrical properties of crystalline solids. Their experimental determination is therefore of crucial importance for technological applications. While the spectral distribution in energy bands is routinely measured by various techniques, it is more difficult to access the topological properties of band structures such as the Berry phase {\gamma}. It is usually thought that measuring the Berry phase requires applying external electromagnetic forces because these allow realizing the adiabatic transport on closed trajectories along which quantum mechanical wave-functions pick up the Berry phase. In graphene, the anomalous quantum Hall effect results from the Berry phase {\gamma} = {\pi} picked up by massless relativistic electrons along cyclotron orbits and proves the existence of Dirac cones. Contradicting this belief, we demonstrate that the Berry phase of graphene can be measured in absence of any external magnetic field. We observe edge dislocations in the Friedel oscillations formed at hydrogen atoms chemisorbed on graphene. Following Nye and Berry in describing these topological defects as phase singularities of complex fields, we show that the number of additional wave-fronts in the dislocation is a real space measurement of the pseudo spin winding, i.e. graphene's Berry phase. Since the electronic dispersion can also be retrieved from Friedel oscillations, our study establishes the electronic density as a powerful observable to determine both the dispersion relation and topological properties of wavefunctions. This could have profound consequences for the study of the band-structure topology of relativistic and gapped phases in solids."

https://openalex.org/W2978381937,"Tremendous amounts of nitrogen (N) fertilizer have been added to arable lands, often resulting in substantial effects on terrestrial ecosystems, including soil acidification, altered enzyme activities and changes in microbial community composition. Soil microbes are the major drivers of soil carbon (C) and N cycling; therefore, understanding the response of microbial communities to elevated N inputs is of significant importance. This study was carried out to investigate the influences of different N fertilization rates (0, 182, and 225 kg ha-1 representing control, low, and high N supply for each crop season for summer maize and winter wheat) on soil biochemical attributes, extracellular enzyme activities, and the microbial community composition in a winter wheat-summer maize rotation cropping system in north-central China. The results showed that N addition significantly decreased the soil pH in both the wheat and maize seasons. Microbial biomass N (MBN) decreased following N fertilization in the wheat season, while the opposite trend in MBN was observed in the maize season. Response ratio analysis showed that the activities of enzymes involved in C, N, and phosphorus cycling were significantly enhanced under N enrichment in both the wheat and maize seasons, and higher enzyme activities were noted in the high N addition treatment than in the low N addition treatment. A linear increase in fungal abundance with the N addition gradient was observed in the wheat season, whereas the fungal abundance increased and then decreased in the maize season. The bacterial abundance showed an increased and then decreased trend in response to the N addition gradient in both the wheat and maize crop seasons. Moreover, the partial least squares path model (PLS-PM) analysis showed that soil pH and soil organic carbon (SOC) were the most important soil variables, causing shifts in the soil bacteria. Furthermore, compared with the N-cycling enzymes, the C-cycling enzymes were significantly affected by the soil pH and SOC. Taken together, these results suggest that the effect of N addition on enzyme activities was consistent in both crop seasons, while the effects on MBN and microbial community composition to N addition were highly variable in the two crop seasons. Moreover, N fertilization-induced changes in the soil chemical properties such as soil acidity and SOC played a substantial role in shaping the microbial community."
https://openalex.org/W2978807241,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder in reproductive-aged women that is comprised of two out of the following three features: hyperandrogenism, oligo- or amenorrhea, or polycystic ovaries. In addition to infertility, many women with PCOS have metabolic dysregulation that increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Changes in the gut microbiome are associated with PCOS and gut microbes may be involved in the pathology of this disorder. Since PCOS often manifests in the early reproductive years, puberty is considered to be a critical time period for the development of PCOS. Exposure to sex steroid hormones during development results in permanent, organizational effects, while activational effects are transient and require the continued presence of the hormone. Androgens exert organizational effects during prenatal or early post-natal development, but it is unclear whether androgen excess results in organizational or activational effects during puberty. We recently developed a letrozole-induced PCOS mouse model that recapitulates both reproductive and metabolic phenotypes of PCOS. In this study, we investigated whether letrozole treatment of pubertal female mice exerts organizational or activational effects on host physiology and the gut microbiome. Two months after letrozole removal, we observed recovery of reproductive and metabolic parameters, as well as diversity and composition of the gut microbiome, indicating that letrozole treatment of female mice during puberty resulted in predominantly activational effects. These results suggest that if exposure to excess androgens during puberty leads to the development of PCOS, reduction of androgen levels during this time may improve reproductive and metabolic phenotypes in women with PCOS. These results also imply that continuous letrozole exposure is required to model PCOS in pubertal female mice since letrozole exerts activational rather than organizational effects during puberty."
https://openalex.org/W2976869240,"The cardiac transcription factor (TF) gene NKX2-5 has been associated with electrocardiographic (EKG) traits through genome-wide association studies (GWASs), but the extent to which differential binding of NKX2-5 at common regulatory variants contributes to these traits has not yet been studied. We analyzed transcriptomic and epigenomic data from induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes from seven related individuals, and identified ~2,000 single-nucleotide variants associated with allele-specific effects (ASE-SNVs) on NKX2-5 binding. NKX2-5 ASE-SNVs were enriched for altered TF motifs, for heart-specific expression quantitative trait loci and for EKG GWAS signals. Using fine-mapping combined with epigenomic data from induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes, we prioritized candidate causal variants for EKG traits, many of which were NKX2-5 ASE-SNVs. Experimentally characterizing two NKX2-5 ASE-SNVs (rs3807989 and rs590041) showed that they modulate the expression of target genes via differential protein binding in cardiac cells, indicating that they are functional variants underlying EKG GWAS signals. Our results show that differential NKX2-5 binding at numerous regulatory variants across the genome contributes to EKG phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2987037678,"Dickkopf-1 (DKK1), an inhibitor of the most frequently impaired signaling pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, seems to fulfill contradictory functions in the process of tumorigenesis, acting either as an oncogenic promoter of metastasis or as a tumor suppressor. Elevated serum levels of DKK1 have been reported in HCC; however, little is known about its functional significance. In the current study, we treated HepG2/C3A and PLC/PRF/5 with the recombinant protein DKK1. Cytotoxicity was first determined by the WST-8 assay. AFP expression was measured at both the mRNA and protein levels. Expression of the oncogenes MYC, CCND1, hTERT, and MDM2 and the tumor suppressor genes TP53, P21 and RB was assessed. Western blot analysis of non-phosphorylated ẞ-catenin and Sanger sequencing were performed to explain the functional differences between the two cell lines. Subsequently, inflammation, migration and invasion were evaluated by qPCR, ELISA, the Boyden chamber assay, zymography, and MMP-2 and MMP-9 western blot analysis. Knockdown of DKK1 and TGF-β1 were also performed. Our results suggest that DKK1 exerts an oncogenic effect on HepG2/C3A cell line by upregulating the expression of oncogenes and downregulating that of tumor suppressor genes, whereas the opposite effect was demonstrated in PLC/PRF/5 cells. This differential impact of DKK1 can be explained by the mutations that affect the canonical Wnt pathway that were detected in exon 3 of the CTNNB1 gene in the HepG2 cell line. We further confirmed that DKK1 promotes inflammation, tumor invasion and migration in both cell types. The canonical pathway was not responsible for the DKK1 proinvasive effect, as indicated by the active ẞ-catenin levels in the two cell lines upon DKK1 treatment. Interestingly, knockdown of TGF-β1 negatively affected the DKK1 proinvasive effect. Taken together, DKK1 appears to facilitate tumor invasion and migration through TGF- β1 by remodeling the tumor microenvironment and inducing inflammation. This finding endorses the relevance of TGF-β1 as a therapeutic target."

https://openalex.org/W2977774745,"Calcium-activated chloride channel regulator 1 (CLCA1) is one of the major nonmucin proteins found in intestinal mucus. It is part of a larger family of CLCA proteins that share highly conserved features and domain architectures. The CLCA domain arrangement is similar to proteins belonging to the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) family, known to process extracellular matrix proteins. Therefore, CLCA1 is an interesting candidate in the search for proteases that process intestinal mucus. Here, we investigated CLCA1's biochemical properties both in vitro and in mucus from mouse and human colon biopsy samples. Using immunoblotting with CLCA1-specific antibodies and recombinant proteins, we observed that the CLCA1 C-terminal self-cleavage product forms a disulfide-linked dimer that noncovalently interacts with the N-terminal part of CLCA1, which further interacts to form oligomers. We also characterized a second, more catalytically active, N-terminal product of CLCA1, encompassing the catalytic domain together with its von Willebrand domain type A (VWA). This fragment was unstable but could be identified in freshly prepared mucus. Furthermore, we found that CLCA1 can cleave the N-terminal part of the mucus structural component MUC2. We propose that CLCA1 regulates the structural arrangement of the mucus and thereby takes part in the regulation of mucus processing."

Here, we describe a novel, highly effective pathway for the particles to cross the alveolar epithelium and reach the lymph and bloodstream. Amorphous silica nanoparticles, suspended in perfluorocarbon, were instilled into the lungs of mice for intravital microscopy. Particles formed agglomerates that settled on the alveolar wall, half of which were removed from the lung within 30 minutes. TEM histology showed agglomerates in stages of crossing the alveolar epithelium, in large compartments inside the epithelial cells and crossing the basal membrane into the interstitium. This pathway is consistent with published kinetic studies in rats and mice, using a host of (negatively) charged and polar nanoparticles."
https://openalex.org/W2978056756,"Cytochrome c (Cytc) is a multifunctional protein that operates as an electron carrier in the mitochondrial electron transport chain and plays a key role in apoptosis. We have previously shown that tissue-specific phosphorylations of Cytc in the heart, liver, and kidney play an important role in the regulation of cellular respiration and cell death. Here, we report that Cytc purified from mammalian brain is phosphorylated on S47 and that this phosphorylation is lost during ischemia. We have characterized the functional effects in vitro using phosphorylated Cytc purified from pig brain tissue and a recombinant phosphomimetic mutant (S47E). We crystallized S47E phosphomimetic Cytc at 1.55 Å and suggest that it spatially matches S47-phosphorylated Cytc, making it a good model system. Both S47-phosphorylated and phosphomimetic Cytc showed a lower oxygen consumption rate in reaction with isolated Cytc oxidase, which we propose maintains intermediate mitochondrial membrane potentials under physiologic conditions, thus minimizing production of reactive oxygen species. S47-phosphorylated and phosphomimetic Cytc showed lower caspase-3 activity. Furthermore, phosphomimetic Cytc had decreased cardiolipin peroxidase activity and is more stable in the presence of H2O2. Our data suggest that S47 phosphorylation of Cytc is tissue protective and promotes cell survival in the brain.-Kalpage, H. A., Vaishnav, A., Liu, J., Varughese, A., Wan, J., Turner, A.

https://openalex.org/W2974939202,"Transposable elements (TEs) compose about half of the mammalian genome and, as embedded sequences, up to 40% of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) transcripts. Embedded TEs may represent functional domains within lncRNAs, providing a structured RNA platform for protein interaction. Here we show the interactome profile of the mouse inverted short interspersed nuclear element (SINE) of subfamily B2 (invSINEB2) alone and embedded in antisense (AS) ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (Uchl1), an lncRNA that is AS to Uchl1 gene. AS Uchl1 is the representative member of a functional class of AS lncRNAs, named SINEUPs, in which the invSINEB2 acts as effector domain (ED)-enhancing translation of sense protein-coding mRNAs. By using RNA-interacting domainome technology, we identify the IL enhancer-binding factor 3 (ILF3) as a protein partner of AS Uchl1 RNA. We determine that this interaction is mediated by the RNA-binding motif 2 of ILF3 and the invSINEB2. Furthermore, we show that ILF3 is able to bind a free right Arthrobacter luteus (Alu) monomer sequence, the embedded TE acting as ED in human SINEUPs. Bioinformatic analysis of Encyclopedia of DNA Elements-enhanced cross-linking immunoprecipitation data reveals that ILF3 binds transcribed human SINE sequences at transcriptome-wide levels. We then demonstrate that the embedded TEs modulate AS Uchl1 RNA nuclear localization to an extent moderately influenced by ILF3. This work unveils the existence of a specific interaction between embedded TEs and an RNA-binding protein, strengthening the model of TEs as functional modules in lncRNAs.-Fasolo, F., Patrucco, L., Volpe, M., Bon, C., Peano, C., Mignone, F., Carninci, P., Persichetti, F., Santoro, C., Zucchelli, S., Sblattero, D., Sanges, R., Cotella, D., Gustincich, S.

https://openalex.org/W2974992562,"Abstract Efficient repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is of critical importance for cell survival. Although non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is the most used DSBs repair pathway in the cells, how NHEJ factors are sequentially recruited to damaged chromatin remains unclear. Here, we identify a novel role for the zinc-finger protein ZNF281 in participating in the ordered recruitment of the NHEJ repair factor XRCC4 at damage sites. ZNF281 is recruited to DNA lesions within seconds after DNA damage through a mechanism dependent on its DNA binding domain and, at least in part, on poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) activity. ZNF281 binds XRCC4 through its zinc-finger domain and facilitates its recruitment to damaged sites. Consequently, depletion of ZNF281 impairs the efficiency of the NHEJ repair pathway and decreases cell viability upon DNA damage. Survival analyses from datasets of commonly occurring human cancers show that higher levels of ZNF281 correlate with poor prognosis of patients treated with DNA-damaging therapies. Thus, our results define a late ZNF281-dependent regulatory step of NHEJ complex assembly at DNA lesions and suggest additional possibilities for cancer patients’ stratification and for the development of personalised therapeutic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2977241457,"Iron is a necessary nutrient for humans and nearly all bacterial species. During Salmonella infection, macrophages limit the availability of iron to intracellular pathogens in one of the central components of nutritional immunity. However, Salmonella also have mechanisms to interfere with the antimicrobial effect of host iron withdrawal and meet their own nutrient requirements by scavenging iron from the host. Here, we provide what is, to our knowledge, the first report that SpvB, a pSLT-encoded cytotoxic protein whose function is associated with the intracellular stage of salmonellosis, perturbs macrophage iron metabolism, thereby facilitating Salmonella survival and intracellular replication. In investigating the underlying mechanism, we observed that the Salmonella effector SpvB down-regulated nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-related factor 2 (NRF2), and its C-terminal domain was necessary and sufficient for NRF2 degradation via the proteasome pathway. Decreased NRF2 expression in the nucleus resulted in a decrease in its transcriptional target ferroportin, encoding the sole macrophage iron exporter, thus ultimately decreasing iron efflux and increasing the intracellular iron content. Additionally, SpvB contributes to the pathogenesis of Salmonella including severe serum hypoferremia, increased splenic and hepatic bacterial burden, and inflammatory injury in vivo. Together, our observations uncovered a novel contribution of SpvB to Salmonella pathology via interference with host intracellular iron metabolism.-Yang, S., Deng, Q., Sun, L., Dong, K., Li, Y., Wu, S., Huang, R.

https://openalex.org/W2975585755,"Barrett’s esophagus (BE) is associated with reflux and is implicated the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). Apoptosis induces cell death through mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), which is considered an irreversible step in apoptosis. Activation of MOMP to levels that fail to reach the apoptotic threshold may paradoxically promote cancer—a phenomenon called “Minority MOMP.” We asked whether reflux-induced esophageal carcinogenesis occurred via minority MOMP and whether compensatory resistance mechanisms prevented cell death during this process. We exposed preneoplastic, hTERT-immortalized Barrett’s cell, CP-C and CP-A, to the oncogenic bile acid, deoxycholic acid (DCA), for 1 year. Induction of minority MOMP was tested via comet assay, CyQuant, annexin V, JC-1, cytochrome C subcellular localization, caspase 3 activation, and immunoblots. We used bcl-2 homology domain-3 (BH3) profiling to test the mitochondrial apoptotic threshold. One-year exposure of Barrett’s cells to DCA induced a malignant phenotype noted by clone and tumor formation. DCA promoted minority MOMP noted by minimal release of cytochrome C and limited caspase 3 activation, which resulted in DNA damage without apoptosis. Upregulation of the antiapoptotic protein, Mcl-1, ROS generation, and NF-κB activation occurred in conjunction with minority MOMP. Inhibition of ROS blocked minority MOMP and Mcl-1 upregulation. Knockdown of Mcl-1 shifted minority MOMP to complete MOMP as noted by dynamic BH3 profiling and increased apoptosis. Minority MOMP contributes to DCA induced carcinogenesis in preneoplastic BE.

GBM has recently been characterized as highly dependent on alternative splicing, a critical driver of tumor heterogeneity and plasticity. Estrogen‐related receptor β (ERR‐β) is an orphan nuclear receptor expressed in the brain, where alternative splicing of the 3' end of the pre‐mRNA leads to the production of 3 validated ERR‐β protein products: ERR‐β short form (ERR‐βsf), ERR‐β2, and ERR‐β exon 10 deleted. Our prior studies have shown the ERR‐β2 isoform to play a role in G 2 /M cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis, in contrast to the function of the shorter ERR‐βsf isoform in senescence and G 1 cell cycle arrest. In this study, we sought to better define the role of the proapoptotic ERR‐β2 isoform in GBM. We show that the ERR‐β2 isoform is located not only in the nucleus but also in the cytoplasm. ERR‐β2 suppresses GBM cell migration and interacts with the actin nucleation‐promoting factor cortactin, and an ERR‐β agonist is able to remodel the actin cytoskeleton and similarly suppress GBM cell migration. We further show that inhibition of the splicing regulatory cdc2‐like kinases in combination with an ERR‐β agonist shifts isoform expression in favor of ERR‐β2 and potentiates inhibition of growth and migration in GBM cells and intracranial tumors.—Tiek, D.

We have previously demonstrated that VX-809, a corrector of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), reduces cyst growth. Here, we show that in normal mice CFTR is located within the cells and also at the apical and basolateral membranes. However, in polycystic kidney disease (pkd1)-knockout mice, CFTR was located at the plasma membrane, consistent with its role in cAMP-dependent fluid secretion. In cystic mice, VX-809 treatment increased CFTR levels at the apical membrane and reduced its association with the endoplasmic reticulum. Surprisingly, VX-809 treatment significantly increased CFTR's co-localization with the basolateral membrane in cystic mice. Na+/H+ exchanger 3 (NHE3) is present in pkd1-knockout and normal mice and in proximal tubule-derived, cultured pkd1-knockout cells. VX-809 increased the expression, activity, and apical plasma membrane localization of NHE3. Co-localization of epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) with the plasma membrane was reduced in cysts in pkd1-knockout mice, consistent with an inability of the cysts to absorb fluid. Interestingly, in the cystic mice, VX-809 treatment increased ENaC levels at the apical plasma membrane consistent with fluid absorption. Thus, VX-809 treatment of pkd1-null mouse kidneys significantly affected CFTR, NHE3, and ENaC, altering the cyst phenotype from one poised toward fluid secretion toward one more favorable for absorption. VX-809 also altered the location of CFTR but not of NHE3 or ENaC in normal mice. Given that VX-809 administration is safe, it may have potential utility for treating patients with ADPKD.

https://openalex.org/W2978287797,"Serum components of sepsis patients vary with the severity of infection, the resulting inflammatory response, per individual, and even over time. Tracking these changes is crucial in properly treating sepsis. Hence, several blood-derived biomarkers have been studied for their potential in assessing sepsis severity. However, the classical approach of selecting individual biomarkers is problematic in terms of accuracy and efficiency. We therefore present a novel approach for detecting biomarkers using longitudinal proteomics data. This does not require a predetermined set of proteins and can therefore reveal previously unknown related proteins. Our approach involves examining changes over time of both protein abundance and post-translational modifications in serum, using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE). 2D-PAGE was conducted using serum from n = 20 patients, collected at five time points, starting from the onset of sepsis. Changes in protein spots were examined using 49 spots for which the signal intensity changed by at least two-fold over time. These were then screened for significant spikes or dips in intensity that occurred exclusively in patients with adverse outcome. Individual level variation was handled by a mixed effects model. Finally, for each time transition, partial correlations between spots were estimated through a Gaussian graphical model (GGM) based on the ridge penalty. Identifications of spots of interest by tandem mass spectrometry revealed that many were either known biomarkers for inflammation (complement components), or had previously been suggested as biomarkers for kidney failure (haptoglobin) or liver failure (ceruloplasmin). The latter two are common complications in severe sepsis. In the GGM, many of the tightly connected spots shared known biological functions or even belonged to the same protein; including hemoglobin chains and acute phase proteins. Altogether, these results suggest that our screening method can successfully identify biomarkers for disease states and cluster biologically related proteins using longitudinal proteomics data derived from 2D-PAGE."
https://openalex.org/W2978820635,"Mucin 5B (MUC5B) has an essential role in mucociliary clearance that protects the pulmonary airways. Accordingly, knowledge of MUC5B structure and its interactions with itself and other proteins is critical to better understand airway mucus biology and improve the management of lung diseases such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The role of an N-terminal multimerization domain in the supramolecular organization of MUC5B has been previously described, but less is known about its C-terminal dimerization domain. Here, using cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analyses of recombinant disulfide-linked dimeric MUC5B dimerization domain we identified an asymmetric, elongated twisted structure, with a double globular base. We found that the dimerization domain is more resistant to disruption than the multimerization domain suggesting the twisted structure of the dimerization domain confers additional stability to MUC5B polymers. Size-exclusion chromatography-multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS), SPR-based biophysical analyses and microscale thermophoresis of the dimerization domain disclosed no further assembly, but did reveal reversible, calcium-dependent interactions between the dimerization and multimerization domains that were most active at acidic pH, suggesting that these domains have a role in MUC5B intragranular organization. In summary, our results suggest a role for the C-terminal dimerization domain of MUC5B in compaction of mucin chains during granular packaging via interactions with the N-terminal multimerization domain. Our findings further suggest that the less stable multimerization domain provides a potential target for mucin depolymerization to remove mucus plugs in COPD and other lung pathologies."

Here, using a novel hybrid fluorescence proximity/sedimentation velocity method in combination with calorimetric analyses, we studied initial binding events by monitoring the sizes and conformations of complexes of Gag with very short oligonucleotides. We observed that high-affinity binding of oligonucleotides induces conformational changes in Gag accompanied by the formation of complexes with a 2:1 Gag/NA stoichiometry. This NA-liganded dimerization mode is distinct from the widely studied dimer interface in the CA domain and from protein interactions arising in the SP1 region and may be mediated by protein-protein interactions localized in the NC domain. The formation of the liganded dimer is strongly enthalpically driven, resulting in higher dimerization affinity than the CA-domain dimer. Both detailed energetic and conformational analyses of different Gag constructs revealed modulatory contributions to NA-induced dimerization from both matrix and CA domains.

Here, we developed a novel IBS rat model combining trinitro-benzene-sulfonic acid (TNBS) and chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) (designated as TC-IBS) and compared it with the TNBS-induced and CUMS-induced models. TC-IBS showed a pronounced depression phenotype with increased corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor (CRHR)1 and CRHR2 expression at the frontal cortex and increased serum ACTH concentration. Visceral hypersensitivity (VH), as evidenced by colorectal distention (CRD) test, was highest in TC-IBS, accompanied by increased serum 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) level and colonic 5-HT receptor 3A (5-HT3AR)/5-HT receptor 2B expression, impaired tight junction protein expression including occludin, zonula occludens-1, and phosphorylated myosin light chain. Palonosetron, a second generation of 5-HT3AR antagonist, alleviated VH significantly in TC-IBS. 16S rRNA sequencing showed that TNBS plus CUMS induced a significant disturbance of the gut microbiota. Cytokine profile analysis of TC-IBS model indicated an innate immune activation both in serum and colonic mucosa. Further, fecal microbiota transplantation improved VH and some pathophysiological changes in TC-IBS.

https://openalex.org/W2975712666,"Sign and goal tracker animals show different behavioral patterns in response to conditioned stimuli, which may be driven by different neural circuits involved in processing stimuli. Here, we explored whether sign and goal-tracker profiles implicated different brain regions and responses to incentive salience of stimuli. We performed three experiments using male Wistar rats. Experiment 1 showed that lesioning the medial prefrontal cortex increased the prevalence of the goal-tracker phenotype. Experiment 2 assessed the developmental trajectory of the salience incentive attribution to a conditioned stimulus, showing that increased incentive salience of stimuli increased the prevalence of the sign-tracker phenotype in mature, but not preadolescent rats. In experiment 3, the functional impact of the medial prefrontal cortex circuits was analyzed with a latent inhibition procedure. Sign tracker rats showed a reduced latent inhibition to stimuli previously exposed when compared to goal tracker or intermediate rats. The overall results of this study highlight a key role of the medial prefrontal cortex for sign tracking behavior. The expression of sign and goal tracker phenotypes changed after lesion to the medial prefrontal cortex (experiment 1), differed across development (experiment 2), and showed differences in the attentional processes to previously exposed stimuli, as preexposure to CS was ineffective in sign tracker animals (experiment 3). These data indicate that the responses to the incentive salience of stimuli in sign tracker and goal tracker profiles are likely driven by different neural circuitry, with a different role of prefrontal cortical function."

Here, we demonstrate that the activation of Gα13 induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition in ovarian cancer (OvCa) cells through down-regulation of large tumor suppressor kinase (LATS) 1, a critical component of the Hippo signaling pathway. A synthetic biology approach using a mutant GPCR and chimeric G-protein revealed that Gα13-regulated phosphorylation of LATS1 at serine 909 within its activation loop induced recruitment of the itchy E3 ubiquitin protein ligase to trigger LATS1 degradation.

https://openalex.org/W2978073738,"Collective behaviour is of fundamental importance in the life sciences, where it appears at levels of biological complexity from single cells to superorganisms, in demography and the social sciences, where it describes the behaviour of populations, and in the physical and engineering sciences, where it describes physical phenomena and can be used to design distributed systems. Reasoning about collective behaviour is inherently difficult, as the non-linear interactions between individuals give rise to complex emergent dynamics. Mathematical techniques have been developed to analyse systematically collective behaviour in such systems, yet these frequently require extensive formal training and technical ability to apply. Even for those with the requisite training and ability, analysis using these techniques can be laborious, time-consuming and error-prone. Together these difficulties raise a barrier-to-entry for practitioners wishing to analyse models of collective behaviour. However, rigorous modelling of collective behaviour is required to make progress in understanding and applying it. Here we present an accessible tool which aims to automate the process of modelling and analysing collective behaviour, as far as possible. We focus our attention on the general class of systems described by reaction kinetics, involving interactions between components that change state as a result, as these are easily understood and extracted from data by natural, physical and social scientists, and correspond to algorithms for component-level controllers in engineering applications. By providing simple automated access to advanced mathematical techniques from statistical physics, nonlinear dynamical systems analysis, and computational simulation, we hope to advance standards in modelling collective behaviour. At the same time, by providing expert users with access to the results of automated analyses, sophisticated investigations that could take significant effort are substantially facilitated. Our tool can be accessed online without installing software, uses a simple programmatic interface, and provides interactive graphical plots for users to develop understanding of their models."

PMF BM-derived CD14+/CD34- monocytes engrafted and induced a PMF-like phenotype with splenomegaly, myeloid hyperplasia with clusters of atypical megakaryocytes, persistence of the JAK2V617F mutation, and BM and spleen fibrosis. As control we used normal human BM-derived CD14+/CD34- monocytes. These monocytes also engrafted and gave rise to normal megakaryocytes that, like PMF CD14+/CD34--derived megakaryocytes, expressed HLA-ABC and human CD42b antigens. Using 2 clonogenic assays we confirmed that PMF and normal BM-derived CD14+/CD34- monocytes give rise to megakaryocyte colony-forming cells, suggesting that a subpopulation BM monocytes harbors megakaryocyte progenitor capacity. Taken together, our data suggest that PMF monocytes induce myelofibrosis-like phenotype in immunodeficient mice and that PMF and normal BM-derived CD14+/CD34- monocytes give rise to megakaryocyte progenitor cells."

A good development of larvae was obtained in polystyrene 6-well cell culture plates in the absence of natural reef substrata, achieving a 60–80% of larvae entering metamorphosis after 32 days, even in bacteria-free seawater, indicating that the bacteria acquired during the brooding period are sufficient to support planulae development. No significant difference in planulae attachment and development was observed when using 0.45 μm or 0.22 μm FSW, although autoclaving the 0.45 μm FSW negatively affected larval development, indicating the presence of beneficial bacteria. Autoclaving the different FSW homogenized the development of the larvae among the different treatments. The addition of bacterial strains isolated from the different FSW did not cause any significant effect on planulae development, although some specific strains of the genus Alteromonas seem to be beneficial for larvae development. Light was beneficial for planulae development after day 20, although no Symbiodinium cells could be observed, indicating either that light acts as a positive cue for larval development or the presence of beneficial phototrophic bacteria in the coral microbiome.

A generalised additive model, adjusted for region, was applied to examine the association between mean temperature and mean sunlight hours with mean alcohol consumption. Results We found a non-linear inverse association between mean monthly temperature and mean alcohol consumption, suggesting that warmer temperature was associated with increased alcohol consumption and colder temperature with a decreased consumption. We found no association between mean sunlight hours and alcohol consumption. Consumption was highest during public holidays. Conclusions We found no association between a colder climate and increased alcohol consumption. Socio-economic factors are likely to explain the suggested association."

We evaluated IMRT use and subsequent impact on Medicare expenditure in the period immediately preceding this recommendation to provide a baseline measure of IMRT use and associated cost consequences. Methods and materials SEER records for women ≥66 years with first primary diagnosis of Stage I/II breast cancer (2008–2011) were linked with Medicare claims (2007–2012). Eligibility criteria included lumpectomy within 6 months of diagnosis and radiotherapy within 6 months of lumpectomy. We evaluated IMRT versus conventional radiotherapy (cRT) use overall and by SEER registry (12 sites). We used generalized estimating equations logit models to explore adjusted odds ratios (OR) for associations between clinical, sociodemographic, and health services characteristics and IMRT use. Mean costs were calculated from Medicare allowable costs in the year after diagnosis. Results Among 13,037 women, mean age was 74.4, 50.5% had left-sided breast cancer, and 19.8% received IMRT. IMRT use varied from 0% to 52% across SEER registries. In multivariable analysis, left-sided breast cancer (OR 1.75), living in a big metropolitan area (OR 2.39), living in a census tract with ≤$90,000 median income (OR 1.75), neutral or favorable local coverage determination (OR 3.86, 1.72, respectively), and free-standing treatment facility (OR 3.49) were associated with receipt of IMRT (p<0.001). Mean expenditure in the year after diagnosis was $8,499 greater (p<0.001) among women receiving IMRT versus cRT. Conclusion We found highly variable use of IMRT and higher expenditure in the year after diagnosis among women treated with IMRT (vs. cRT) with early-stage breast cancer and Medicare insurance. Our findings suggest a considerable opportunity to reduce treatment variation and cost of care while improving alignment between practice and clinical guidelines."
https://openalex.org/W2978734623,"Background Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is known to co-occur with other addictions, as well as with mental health problems. However, the effects of other addictions co-occurring with AUD on mental health problems were rarely studied and not considering them may bias estimates of the association between AUD and mental health problems. This study investigated which role co-occurring addictions play for the cross-sectional associations between self-reported AUD and mental health problems. Method Participants were 5516 young Swiss men (73.0% of those that gave written informed consent) who completed a self-report questionnaire. Using short screening questionnaires, we assessed three substance use disorders (alcohol, cannabis and tobacco), seven behavioural addictions (internet, gaming, smartphone, internet sex, gambling, work, exercise) and four mental health problems (major depression, bipolar disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and social anxiety disorder). Differences in the proportions of mental health problems were tested using logistic regressions between (1) participants with no AUD and AUD, (2) participants with no AUD and AUD alone and (3) participants with no AUD and AUD plus at least one co-occurring addiction. Results Overall, (1) participants with AUD had higher proportions of major depression (Odds ratio (OR [95% confidence interval]) = 3.51 [2.73, 4.52]; ADHD (OR = 3.12 [2.41, 4.03]); bipolar disorder (OR = 4.94 [3.38, 7.21]) and social anxiety (OR = 2.21 [1.79, 2.73])) compared to participants with no AUD. Considering only participants with AUD alone compared to participants with no AUD (2), differences in proportions were no longer significant for major depression (OR = 0.83 [0.42, 1.64]), bipolar disorder (OR = 1.69 [0.67, 4.22]), social anxiety (OR = 1.15 [0.77, 1.73]) and ADHD (OR = 1.65 [1.00, 2.72]) compared to participants with no AUD. In contrast, (3) proportions of mental health problems were considerably higher for participants with AUD plus at least one other addiction when compared to participants with no AUD, with OR’s ranging from 2.90 [2.27, 3.70] for social anxiety, 4.03 [3.02, 5.38] for ADHD, 5.29 [4.02, 6.97] for major depression to 6.64 [4.44, 9.94] for bipolar disorder. Conclusions AUD was associated with all four measured mental health problems. However, these associations were mainly due to the high proportions of these mental health problems in participants with AUD plus at least one co-occurring addiction and only to a lesser degree due to participants with AUD alone (i.e. without any other co-occurring addictions). Hence, estimates of the association between AUD and mental health problems that do not consider other addictions may be biased (i.e. overestimated). These findings imply that considering addictions co-occurring with AUD, including behavioural addictions, is important when investigating associations between AUD and mental health problems, and for the treatment of AUD and co-morbid disorders."

However, the reprogramming process in hiPSCs remains poorly understood. Here we used mass cytometry to analyze the expression of pluripotency and cell cycle markers in the reprogramming of human stem cells. We confirmed that, during reprogramming, the main cell population was shifted to an intermediate population consisting of neither fibroblasts nor hiPSCs. Detailed population analyses using computational approaches, including dimensional reduction by spanning-tree progression analysis of density-normalized events, PhenoGraph, and diffusion mapping, revealed several distinct cell clusters representing the cells along the reprogramming route. Interestingly, correlation analysis of various markers in hiPSCs revealed that the pluripotency marker TRA-1–60 behaves in a pattern that is different from other pluripotency markers. Furthermore, we found that the expression pattern of another pluripotency marker, octamer-binding protein 4 (OCT4), was distinctive in the pHistone-H3high population (M phase) of the cell cycle. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first mass cytometry–based investigation of human reprogramming and pluripotency.

Subcellular origin and biological function as well as prognostic impact are currently unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether vacuolization correlates with clinically relevant AML features.Bone marrow smears of patients diagnosed with AML at the University Hospital Frankfurt between January 2011 and August 2013 were analyzed for blast vacuolization and correlated with clinically relevant AML features. Patients undergoing standard induction chemotherapy were further analyzed for molecular and cytogenetic features as well as treatment response and survival.14 of 100 patients diagnosed with AML receiving standard induction chemotherapy had evidence of blast vacuolization. Positivity for vacuolization correlated with a CD15 positive immunophenotype and with a higher incidence of high-risk AML according to the European LeukemiaNet risk stratification. AML patients with blast vacuolization had a poor blast clearance after standard induction chemotherapy and poor survival.In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that vacuolization can easily be determined in myeloid leukemia blasts and may be a useful biomarker to predict AML risk groups as well as early treatment response rates and survival."
https://openalex.org/W2978765002,"The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) induces B-cell proliferation with high efficiency through expression of latent proteins and microRNAs. This process takes place in vivo soon after infection, presumably to expand the virus reservoir, but can also induce pathologies, e.g. an infectious mononucleosis (IM) syndrome after primary infection or a B-cell lymphoproliferation in immunosuppressed individuals. In this paper, we investigated the growth characteristics of EBV-infected B-cells isolated from transplant recipients or patients with IM. We found that these cells grew and withstood apoptosis at highly variable rates, suggesting that the expansion rate of the infected B-cells widely varies between individuals, thereby influencing the size of the B-cell reservoir and the ability to form tumors in infected individuals. All viruses investigated were type 1 and genetically close to western strains. EBV-infected B-cells expressed the transforming EBV latent genes and microRNAs (miRNAs) at variable levels. We found that the B-cell growth rates positively correlated with the BHRF1 miRNA levels. Comparative studies showed that infected B-cells derived from transplant recipients with iEBVL on average expressed higher levels of EBV miR-BHRF1 miRNAs and grew more rapidly than B-cells from IM patients, suggesting infection by more transforming viruses. Altogether, these findings suggest that EBV infection has a highly variable impact on the B-cell compartment that probably reflects the genetic diversity of both the virus and the host. It also demonstrates the unexpected finding that B-cells from different individuals can grow at different speed under the influence of the same virus infection."

We applied a directional distance function to estimate the carbon emission performance of 30 provinces in China during the period 2000–2016. We selected an index system to assess urbanization processes in these provinces and conducted a spatial analysis to investigate the relationship between urbanization and carbon emission performance. We obtained the following results. First, the carbon emission performance of the eastern region, valued at 0.853, was relatively higher than the corresponding values of 0.810, 0.804, and 0.843 in the central, western, and northeastern regions, respectively. However, during this period, disparities among provinces increased. Second, the average urbanization value for each province showed an upward trend during the study period, and urbanization assumed a “striped” spatial agglomeration pattern. A third finding was that carbon emission performance and urbanization demonstrated a relationship of positive spatial dependence. The average value of their coordinated coupling indicated an upward trend, with an annual increase of 0.85%. Last, we found that efforts to reduce carbon emissions that are solely based on carbon emission performance do not yield reliable results. Accordingly, measurements of urbanization values can enable more detailed differentiation. In conclusion, reasonable measures should be implemented to improve carbon emission performance and urbanization that are in alignment with the actual situation within a given region."
https://openalex.org/W2978159768,"To examine the epidemiology and outcomes of in-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) among patients with cirrhosis.We used the Texas Inpatient Public Use Data File to identify hospitalizations aged ≥ 18 years with and without cirrhosis during 2009-2014 and those in each group who have undergone in-hospital CPR. Short-term survival (defined as absence of hospital mortality or discharge to hospice) following in-hospital CPR was examined. Multivariate logistic regression modeling was used to assess the prognostic impact of cirrhosis following in-hospital CPR and predictors of short-term survival among cirrhosis hospitalizations.In-hospital CPR was reported in 2,511 and 51,969 hospitalizations with and without cirrhosis, respectively. The rate of in-hospital CPR (per 1,000 hospitalizations) was 7.6 and 4.0 among hospitalizations with and without cirrhosis, respectively. The corresponding rate of in-hospital CPR among decedents was 10.7% and 13.4%, respectively. Short-term survival following in-hospital CPR among hospitalizations with and without cirrhosis was 14.9% and 27.3%, respectively, and remained unchanged over time on adjusted analyses among the former (p = 0.1753), while increasing among the latter (p = 0.0404). Cirrhosis was associated with lower odds of short-term survival following in-hospital CPR (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.55 [95% CI: 0.49-0.62]). Lack of health insurance (vs. Medicare) (aOR] 0.47 [95% CI: 0.34-0.67]) and sepsis ([aOR] 0.67 [95% CI: 0.53-85]) were associated with lower odds of short-term survival following in-hospital CPR among cirrhosis hospitalizations.The rate of in-hospital CPR was nearly 2-fold higher among hospitalizations with cirrhosis than among those without it, though it was used more selectively among the former. Short-term survival following in-hospital CPR remained markedly lower among cirrhosis hospitalizations, while progressively improving among those without cirrhosis. Strategies to increase access to health insurance and improve early identification and control of infection should be explored in future preventive and interventional efforts."
