https://openalex.org/W2588003167,"Surface area expansion from 6–12 months precedes brain overgrowth in high risk infants diagnosed with autism at 24 months and cortical features in the first year predict individual diagnostic outcomes. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with brain overgrowth, but it has been unclear how this relates to behavioural symptoms. In a longitudinal neuroimaging study of young children at high familial risk of autism, Heather Hazlett and colleagues now show that high-risk children who receive a diagnosis of ASD at 24 months of age had an increased cortical growth rate at 6–12 months. Early overgrowth in high-risk children is associated with social impairments at 24 months, and imaging data obtained at 6 and 12 months can predict an ASD diagnosis at 24 months in high-risk children. These findings indicate that differences in the developmental trajectory towards ASD emerge as early as the first year of life. Brain enlargement has been observed in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but the timing of this phenomenon, and the relationship between ASD and the appearance of behavioural symptoms, are unknown. Retrospective head circumference and longitudinal brain volume studies of two-year olds followed up at four years of age have provided evidence that increased brain volume may emerge early in development1,2. Studies of infants at high familial risk of autism can provide insight into the early development of autism and have shown that characteristic social deficits in ASD emerge during the latter part of the first and in the second year of life3,4. These observations suggest that prospective brain-imaging studies of infants at high familial risk of ASD might identify early postnatal changes in brain volume that occur before an ASD diagnosis. In this prospective neuroimaging study of 106 infants at high familial risk of ASD and 42 low-risk infants, we show that hyperexpansion of the cortical surface area between 6 and 12 months of age precedes brain volume overgrowth observed between 12 and 24 months in 15 high-risk infants who were diagnosed with autism at 24 months. Brain volume overgrowth was linked to the emergence and severity of autistic social deficits. A deep-learning algorithm that primarily uses surface area information from magnetic resonance imaging of the brain of 6–12-month-old individuals predicted the diagnosis of autism in individual high-risk children at 24 months (with a positive predictive value of 81% and a sensitivity of 88%). These findings demonstrate that early brain changes occur during the period in which autistic behaviours are first emerging."
https://openalex.org/W2587773334,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the world, and aberrant expression of miRNA is a common feature during the cancer initiation and development. Our previous study showed that levels of miRNA-148a assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) were a good prognosis factor for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. In this study, we used high-throughput formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) lung cancer tissue arrays and in situ hybridization (ISH) to determine the clinical significances of miRNA-148a and aimed to find novel target of miRNA-148a in lung cancer. Our results showed that there were 86 of 159 patients with low miRNA-148a expression and miRNA-148a was significantly down-regulated in primary cancer tissues when compared with their adjacent normal lung tissues. Low expression of miRNA-148a was strongly associated with high tumor grade, lymph node (LN) metastasis and a higher risk of tumor-related death in NSCLC. Lentivirus mediated overexpression of miRNA-148a inhibited migration and invasion of A549 and H1299 lung cancer cells. Furthermore, we validated Wnt1 as a direct target of miRNA-148a. Our data showed that the Wnt1 expression was negatively correlated with the expression of miRNA-148a in both primary cancer tissues and their corresponding adjacent normal lung tissues. In addition, overexpression of miRNA-148a inhibited Wnt1 protein expression in cancer cells. And knocking down of Wnt-1 by siRNA had the similar effect of miRNA-148a overexpression on cell migration and invasion in lung cancer cells. In conclusion, our results suggest that miRNA-148a inhibited cell migration and invasion through targeting Wnt1 and this might provide a new insight into the molecular mechanisms of lung cancer metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2587907134,"Objective Early temperamental characteristics may influence children’s developmental pathways and predict future psychopathology. However, the environmental context may also shape or interact with infant temperament and indirectly contribute to increased vulnerability to adverse developmental outcomes. The aim of the present study is to explore the long-term contribution of temperamental traits at twelve months of age to the presence of emotional and behavioral problems later in childhood, and whether this association varies with the child’s sex, parental separation, family socioeconomic status and maternal depression. Method 1184 mother-child pairs from the EDEN mother-child birth cohort study based in France (2003–2011), were followed from 24–28 weeks of pregnancy to the child’s fifth birthday. Infant temperament at 12 months was assessed with the Emotionality Activity and Sociability (EAS) questionnaire and behavior at 5.5 years was assessed with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Results Emotional temperament in infancy predicts children’s overall behavioral scores (β = 1.16, p<0.001), emotional difficulties (β = 0.30, p<0.001), conduct problems (β = 0.51, p<0.001) and symptoms of hyperactivity/inattention (β = 0.31, p = 0.01) at 5.5 years. Infants’ active temperament predicts later conduct problems (β = 0.30, p = 0.02), while shyness predicts later emotional problems (β = 0.22, p = 0.04). The association between the child’s temperament in infancy and later behavior did not vary with children’s own or family characteristics. Conclusion An emotional temperament in infancy is associated with higher levels of emotional and behavioral difficulties at the age of 5.5 years. Children who show high emotionality early on may require early prevention and intervention efforts to divert possible adverse developmental pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2589065559,"Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is an endocrine disrupting chemical commonly used as a plasticizer in medical equipment, food packaging, flooring, and children's toys. DEHP exposure during early development has been associated with adverse neurobehavioral outcomes in children. In animal models, early exposure to DEHP results in abnormal development of the reproductive system as well as altered behavior and neurodevelopment. Based on these data, we hypothesized that developmental exposure to DEHP would decrease social interactions and increase anxiety-like behaviors in mice in a dose-dependent manner, and that the effects would persist over generations. C57BL/6J mice consumed one of three DEHP doses (0, 5, 40, and 400 μg/kg body weight) throughout pregnancy and during the first ten days of lactation. The two higher doses yielded detectable levels of DEHP metabolites in serum. Pairs of mice from control, low, and high DEHP doses were bred to create three dose lineages in the third generation (F3). Average anogenital index (AGI: anogenital distance/body weight) was decreased in F1 males exposed to the low dose of DEHP and in F1 females exposed to the highest dose. In F1 mice, juvenile pairs from the two highest DEHP dose groups displayed fewer socially investigative behaviors and more exploratory behaviors as compared with control mice. The effect of DEHP on these behaviors was reversed in F3 mice as compared with F1 mice. F1 mice exposed to low and medium DEHP doses spent more time in the closed arms of the elevated plus maze than controls, indicating increased anxiety-like behavior. The generation-dependent effects on behavior and AGI suggest complex mechanisms by which DEHP directly impacts reproductive and neurobehavioral development and influences germline-inherited traits."
https://openalex.org/W2587783829,"Early detection of HIV infection is the best way to prevent spread of the disease and to improve the efficiency of the antiretroviral therapy. Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) have become the gold-standard for detecting low-concentrations of the virus in blood. However, these methods are technically demanding and cost-prohibitive in developing countries. Immunoassays are more affordable and can be more easily adapted for point-of-care diagnosis. However, the sensitivity so far of these methods has been too low. We here report the development of a sandwich immunoassay that combines nanomechanical and optoplasmonic transduction methods for detecting the HIV-1 capsid antigen p24 in human serum. The immunoreactions take place on the surface of a compliant microcantilever where gold nanoparticles are used as both mechanical and plasmonic labels. The microcantilever acts as both a mechanical resonator and an optical cavity for the transduction of the mechanical and plasmonic signals. The limit of detection of the immunoassay is 10−17 g/mL that is equivalent to one virion in 10 mL of plasma. This is 5 orders of magnitude better than last generation of approved immunoassays and 2 orders of magnitude better than NAAT. This technology meets the demands to be produced en masse at low cost and the capability for miniaturization to be used at the point-of-care."
https://openalex.org/W2588085118,"Treatment of pelvic tumors remains challenging due to complex anatomy, poor oncological outcome and high complication rates. We sought to investigate the long-term oncological and surgical outcome of these patients.Between 1980 and 2012, 147 patients underwent surgical treatment for pelvic sarcoma. Histological diagnosis was Chondrosarcoma in 54, Ewing's Sarcoma/PNET in 37, Osterosarcoma in 32 and others in 24 patients. Statistical analysis for the evaluation of oncological and surgical outcome was performed by applying Cox proportional hazards regression and Fine-Gray regression models for competing risk (CR) endpoints.The estimated overall survival (OS) to death was 80%, 45% and 37% at 1, 5 and 10 years, respectively. Univariate analyses revealed a statistically significant unadjusted influence of age age (p = 0.038; HR = 1.01), margin (p = 0.043; HR = 0.51) and grade (p = 0.001; HR = 2.27) on OS. Considering the multivariable model, grade (p = 0.005; HR = 3.04) and tumor volume (p = 0.014; HR = 1.18) presented themselves as independent prognostic factors on OS. CR analysis showed a cumulative incidence for major complication of 31% at 5 years. Endoprosthetic reconstruction had a higher risk for experiencing a major complication (p<0.0001) and infection (p = 0.001).Pelvic resections are still associated with a high incidence of complications. Patients with pelvic reconstruction and high volume tumors are especially at risk. Consequently, a cautious decision-making process is necessary when indicating pelvic reconstruction, although a restrictive approach to pelvic reconstruction is not necessarily reasonable when the other option is major amputation."

When DSBs are repaired by homologous recombination, DNA ends can undergo extensive processing, producing long stretches of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). In vivo, DSB processing occurs in the context of chromatin, and studies indicate that histones may remain associated with processed DSBs. Here we demonstrate that histones are not evicted from ssDNA after in vitro chromatin resection. In addition, we reconstitute histone-ssDNA complexes (termed ssNucs) with ssDNA and recombinant histones and analyze these particles by a combination of native gel electrophoresis, sedimentation velocity, electron microscopy, and a recently developed electrostatic force microscopy technique, DREEM (dual-resonance frequency-enhanced electrostatic force microscopy). The reconstituted ssNucs are homogenous and relatively stable, and DREEM reveals ssDNA wrapping around histones. We also find that histone octamers are easily transferred in trans from ssNucs to either double-stranded DNA or ssDNA. Furthermore, the Fun30 remodeling enzyme, which has been implicated in DNA repair, binds ssNucs preferentially over nucleosomes, and ssNucs are effective at activating Fun30 ATPase activity. Our results indicate that ssNucs may be a hallmark of processes that generate ssDNA, and that posttranslational modification of ssNucs may generate novel signaling platforms involved in genome stability.

https://openalex.org/W2588463311,"Tafazzin is a mitochondrial enzyme that transfers fatty acids from phospholipids to lysophospholipids. Mutations in tafazzin cause abnormal molecular species of cardiolipin and the clinical phenotype of Barth syndrome. However, the mechanism by which tafazzin creates acyl specificity has been controversial. We have shown that the lipid phase state can produce acyl specificity in the tafazzin reaction, but others have reported that tafazzin itself carries enzymatic specificity. To resolve this issue, we replicated and expanded the controversial experiments, i.e. the transfer of different acyl groups from phosphatidylcholine to monolysocardiolipin by yeast tafazzin. Our data show that this reaction requires the presence of detergent and does not take place in liposomes but in mixed micelles. To separate thermodynamic (lipid-dependent) from kinetic (enzyme-dependent) parameters, we followed the accumulation of cardiolipin during the reaction from the initial state to the equilibrium state. The transacylation rates of different acyl groups varied over 2 orders of magnitude and correlated tightly with the concentration of cardiolipin in the equilibrium state (lipid-dependent parameter). In contrast, the rates by which different transacylations approached the equilibrium state were very similar (enzyme-dependent parameter). Furthermore, we found that tafazzin catalyzes the remodeling of cardiolipin by combinations of forward and reverse transacylations, essentially creating an equilibrium distribution of acyl groups. These data strongly support the idea that the acyl specificity of the tafazzin reaction results from the physical properties of lipids.

However, little is known about the function and profile of lncRNAs in intramuscular preadipocyte differentiation in chicken. Here, we identified lncRNAs in chicken intramuscular preadipocytes at different differentiation stages using RNA sequencing. A total of 1,311,382,604 clean reads and 25,435 lncRNAs were obtained from 12 samples. In total, 7,433 differentially expressed genes (4,698 lncRNAs and 2,735 mRNAs) were identified by pairwise comparison. These 7,433 differentially expressed genes were grouped into 11 clusters based on their expression patterns by K-means clustering. Using Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis, we identified four stage-specific modules positively related to I0, I2, I4, and I6 stages and two stage-specific modules negatively related to I0 and I2 stages, respectively. Many well-known and novel pathways associated with intramuscular preadipocyte differentiation were identified. We also identified hub genes in each stage-specific module and visualized them in Cytoscape. Our analysis revealed many highly-connected genes, including XLOC_058593, BMP3, MYOD1, and LAMP3. This study provides a valuable resource for chicken lncRNA study and improves our understanding of the biology of preadipocyte differentiation in chicken."
https://openalex.org/W2588897240,"Aims To investigate the associations of dyslipidemia with insulin resistance and β cell function in individuals with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and different categories of impaired glucose regulation (IGR). Methods 544 subjects (365 with dyslipidemia and/or IGR and 179 with normal lipid and glucose tolerance) were enrolled in the study. All subjects underwent oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). HOMA-IR was used to evaluate insulin sensitivity. Disposition index (DI) was used to evaluate β cell function. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to assess correlations among lipid profiles, insulin resistance and β cell function. Results Among subjects with NGT, those with dyslipidemia had higher level of HOMA-IR but lower level of DI. While among subjects with different categories of IGR, those with dyslipidemia and CGI had significantly decreased DI. No obvious differences of insulin resistance or β cell function were found in IFG or IGT subjects with or without dyslipidemia. TG and HDL-C were correlated with HOMA-IR (β = 0.79, p <0.001; β = -0.38, p = 0.027, respectively, compared with subjects in the low level groups). Moreover, TG and TC were negatively correlated with DI (β = -2.17, p = 0.013; β = -2.01, p = 0.034 respectively, compared with subjects in the low level groups) after adjusting for confounding parameters. Conclusions Dyslipidemia induces insulin resistance and impaired β cell response to insulin resistance in individuals with NGT. Furthermore, dyslipidemia diminishes β cell function in subjects with CGI. TG and HDL-C were correlated with insulin resistance, and TG, TC were negatively correlated with β cell response to insulin resistance in non-diabetic individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2588452154,"The significance of maternal cholesterol transporting to the fetus under normal as well as pathological circumstances is less understood. The objective of this study was to observe the effects of maternal hypercholesterolemia on placental cholesterol transportation. Human full-time placenta, maternal and venous cord blood were sampled at delivery from the pregnant women with serum total cholesterol (TC) concentrations at third trimester higher than 7.25 mM (n = 19) and the pregnant women with normal TC concentrations (n = 19). Serum lipids and expression of genes related to cholesterol transportation were measured by western blot or real-time PCR. The results indicated that serum TC, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels were significantly increased, in pregnancies, but decreased in cord blood in hypercholesterolemic group compared to the matched control group. All the subjects were no-drinking, non-smoker, and gestational disease free. The mRNA expression of lipoprotein receptors, including LDLR and VLDLR were significantly increased, while the protein expression of PCSK9 was significantly increased in hypercholesterolemic placenta. In conclusion, maternal hypercholesterolemia might decrease the transportation of cholesterol from mother to fetus because of the high levels of PCSK9 protein expression."
https://openalex.org/W2588826956,"Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) primarily replicates in epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract of chickens, inducing both morphological and immune modulatory changes. However, the association between the local immune responses induced by IBV and the mechanisms of pathogenesis has not yet been completely elucidated. This study compared the expression profile of genes related to immune responses in tracheal samples after challenge with two Brazilian field isolates (A and B) of IBV from the same genotype, associating these responses with viral replication and with pathological changes in trachea and kidney. We detected a suppressive effect on the early activation of TLR7 pathway, followed by lower expression levels of inflammatory related genes induced by challenge with the IBV B isolate when compared to the challenge with to the IBV A isolate. Cell-mediated immune (CMI) related genes presented also lower levels of expression in tracheal samples from birds challenged with B isolate at 1dpi. Increased viral load and a higher percentage of birds with relevant lesions were observed in both tracheal and renal samples from chickens exposed to challenge with IBV B isolate. This differential pattern of early immune responses developed after challenge with IBV B isolate, related to the downregulation of TLR7, leading to insufficient pro-inflammatory response and lower CMI responses, seem to have an association with a most severe renal lesion and an enhanced capability of replication of this isolate in chicken."

https://openalex.org/W2588111562,"Introduction Research in animal models and preliminary clinical studies in humans support the use of pravastatin for the prevention of preeclampsia. However, its use during pregnancy is still controversial due to limited data about its effect on the human placenta and fetus. Methods In the present study, human placental cotyledons were perfused in the absence or presence of pravastatin in the maternal reservoir (PraM). In addition, placental explants were treated with pravastatin for 5, 24 and 72 h under normoxia and hypoxia. We monitored the secretion of placental growth factor (PlGF), soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1), soluble endoglin (sEng), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression and activation and the fetal vasoconstriction response to angiotensin-II. Results The concentrations of PlGF, sFlt-1 and sEng were not significantly altered by pravastatin in PraM cotyledons and in placental explants compared to control. Under hypoxic conditions, pravastatin decreased sFlt-1 concentrations. eNOS expression was significantly increased in PraM cotyledons but not in pravastatin-treated placental explants cultured under normoxia or hypoxia. eNOS phosphorylation was not significantly affected by pravastatin. The feto-placental vascular tone and the fetal vasoconstriction response to angiotensin-II, did not change following exposure of the maternal circulation to pravastatin. Conclusion We found that pravastatin does not alter the essential physiological functions of the placenta investigated in the study. The relevance of the study lays in the fact that it expands the current knowledge obtained thus far regarding the effect of the drug on the normal human placenta. This data is reassuring and important for clinicians that consider the treatment of high-risk patients with pravastatin, a treatment that exposes some normal pregnancies to the drug."
https://openalex.org/W2588220328,"The present study compared the effects of two repeated-sprint training (RST) programs, differing in duration of the between-sprint rest intervals, on various soccer-related exercise performances. For 5 weeks during the competitive season, twenty-nine young trained male soccer players either replaced two of their habitual fitness conditioning sessions with RST characterized by short (5-15; n = 9) or long (5-30; n = 10) rest intervals, or served as control (n = 10). The 5-15 and 5-30 protocols consisted of 6 repetitions of 30-m (~5 s) straight-line sprints interspersed with 15 s or 30 s of passive recovery, respectively. 5-15 improved 200-m sprint time (2.0±1.5%; p<0.05) and had a likely positive impact on 20-m sprint performance, whereas 5-30 lowered the 20-m sprint time (2.7±1.6%; p<0.05) but was only possibly effective for enhancing the 200-m sprint performance. The distance covered during the Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Test Level 2 increased following 5-15 (11.4±5.0%; p<0.05), which was possibly better than the non-significant 6.5% enhancement observed in 5-30. Improvements in the total time of a repeated-sprint ability test were possibly greater following 5-30 (3.6±0.9%; p<0.05) compared to 5-15 (2.6±1.1%; p<0.05). Both RST interventions led to similar beneficial (p<0.05) reductions in the percentage decrement score (~30%) of the repeated-sprint ability test as well as in blood lactate concentration during submaximal exercise (17-18%). No changes occurred in the control group. In soccer players, RST over a 5-week in-season period is an efficient means to simultaneously develop different components of fitness relevant to match performance, with different benefits induced by shorter compared to longer rest intervals."

Hearts from 57Fe-enriched mice were evaluated by Mössbauer spectroscopy. Spectra consisted of a sextet and two quadrupole doublets. One doublet was due to residual blood, whereas the other was due to [Fe4S4]2+ clusters and low-spin FeII hemes, most of which were associated with mitochondrial respiration. The sextet was due to ferritin; there was no evidence of hemosiderin, a ferritin decomposition product. Iron from ferritin was nearly absent in young hearts, but increased steadily with age. EPR spectra exhibited signals similar to those of brain, liver, and human cells. No age-dependent EPR trends were apparent. Hearts from HFE−/− mice with hemochromatosis contained slightly more iron overall than controls, including more ferritin and less mitochondrial iron; these differences typify slightly older hearts, perhaps reflecting the burden due to this disease. HFE−/− livers were overloaded with ferritin but had low mitochondrial iron levels. IRP2−/− hearts contained less ferritin than controls but normal levels of mitochondrial iron. Hearts of young mice born to an iron-deficient mother contained normal levels of mitochondrial iron and no ferritin; the heart from the mother contained low ferritin and normal levels of mitochondrial iron. High-spin FeII ions were nearly undetectable in heart samples; these were evident in brains, livers, and human cells.

From an early stage of fetal development until the end of life, the heart functions unceasingly to pump blood throughout the body. This requires a high and sustained level of metabolic energy unrivaled by any other organ except perhaps the brain. Mitochondria, the organelle responsible for generating most of the chemical energy in cells, serve a critical role in cardiac function. Improving our understanding of cardiac physiology is important because heart disease is the most common cause of death in the Western world (1.Sanchis-Gomar F. Perez-Quilis C. Leischik R. Lucia A.

Much of the iron that enters cardiomyocytes is used to build iron-sulfur clusters (ISCs) 3The abbreviations used are: ISCiron-sulfur clusterBDblood doubletΔEQquadrupole splittingFAFriedreich ataxiaHFEhigh iron geneHFE−/−genotype in which both alleles of the HFE gene have been mutatedHHhereditary hemochromatosisICP-MSinductively coupled plasma mass spectrometryIREiron responsive elementIRP1/2iron responsive element proteins 1 and 2IRP2−/−genotype in which both alleles of the IRP2 gene have been mutatedMBMössbauerNHHSnonheme high-spinROSreactive oxygen speciesTfR1transferrin receptor 1mt-ferritinmitochondrial ferritin. and heme centers many of which are installed into mitochondrial respiratory complexes and respiration-related proteins. Excess cellular iron is generally stored within the core of cytosolic ferritin, a spherically shaped protein complex composed of variable ratios of H- and L-subunits (2.Theil E.C. Tosha T.

MB spectroscopy is the most powerful spectroscopic tool for probing the iron content of biological materials, but it has not been applied extensively to vertebrate animals (37.Chakrabarti M.

MB is relatively insensitive and can only detect 57Fe, which accounts for just 2% of naturally occurring iron. As a result, spectra of unenriched mammalian organs are noisy, even when iron overloaded. Enriching mammals in 57Fe is inconvenient and costly. Nevertheless, we enriched mice with 57Fe for this study. In earlier studies, we used MB spectroscopy to characterize the iron content of brain and liver (34.Chakrabarti M. Cockrell A.L. Park J.

We also investigate hearts from HFE−/− mice with hemochromatosis, hearts from IRP2−/− mice, and hearts from an iron-deficient mouse and her offspring. We wanted to characterize the iron content of healthy mammalian hearts at different developmental stages, and used MB spectroscopy as our primary tool. We enriched mice with 57Fe to improve spectral quality. Analyses were augmented by EPR spectroscopy and ICP-MS analysis. Mice were euthanized at different ages and immediately imported into a refrigerated anaerobic glove box where blood was flushed extensively with Ringer's buffer. Hearts and other organs were removed by dissection, and frozen in MB cups for later analysis. Low-field MB spectra were collected on whole intact hearts from elderly (Fig. 1), young (Fig. 2), and adult (Fig. 3) mice. For each group, multiple spectra are shown to help distinguish sample-to-sample variations from age-dependent changes. Distinguishing this is a challenge for studies like this in which only small numbers of animals can be investigated. After collecting spectra, samples were analyzed for metal concentrations. These results, and the MB parameters used in simulations are compiled in Table 1.

Here, we report that mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for as little as 1–3 days show increased differentiation of myeloid progenitors into neutrophils and monocytes but reduced B lymphocyte production in the bone marrow. Levels of neutrophil elastase (NE) and the nuclear factors CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα) and growth factor-independent 1 (GFI-1) are elevated in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from HFD-fed mice, but mice lacking either NE or C/EBPα are resistant to HFD-induced myelopoiesis. NE deletion increases expression of the inhibitory isoform of p30 C/EBPα, impairs the transcriptional activity of p42 C/EBPα, and reduces expression of the C/EBPα target gene GFI-1 in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, suggesting a mechanism by which NE regulates myelopoiesis. Furthermore, NE deletion prevents HFD-induced vascular leakage. Thus, HFD feeding rapidly activates bone marrow myelopoiesis through the NE-dependent C/EBPα-GFI-1 pathway preceding vascular damage and systemic inflammation.

https://openalex.org/W2588765702,"The sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus (Lamarck, 1816) is a keystone herbivore in the Mediterranean Sea due to its ability to transform macroalgal-dominated communities into barren areas characterized by increased cover of bare substrates and encrusting coralline algae, reduced biodiversity and altered ecosystem functions. P. lividus is also an excellent animal model for toxicology, physiology and biology investigations having been used for more than a century as a model for embryological studies with synchronously developing embryos which are easy to manipulate and analyze for morphological aberrations. Despite its importance for the scientific community, the complete genome is still not fully annotated. To date, only a few molecular tools are available and a few Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) studies have been performed. Here we aimed at setting-up an RNA extraction method to obtain high quality and sufficient quantity of RNA for NGS from P. lividus embryos at the pluteus stage. We compared five different RNA extraction protocols from four different pools of plutei (500, 1000, 2500 and 5000 embryos): TRIzol®, and four widely-used Silica Membrane kits, GenElute™ Mammalian Total RNA Miniprep Kit, RNAqueous® Micro Kit, RNeasy® Micro Kit and Aurum™ Total RNA Mini Kit. The quantity of RNA isolated was evaluated using NanoDrop. The quality, considering the purity, was measured as A260/A280 and A260/230 ratios. The integrity was measured by RNA Integrity Number (RIN). Our results demonstrated that the most efficient procedures were GenElute, RNeasy and Aurum, producing a sufficient quantity of RNA for NGS. The Bioanalyzer profiles and RIN values revealed that the most efficient methods guaranteeing for RNA integrity were RNeasy and Aurum combined with an initial preservation in RNAlater. This research represents the first attempt to standardize a method for high-quality RNA extraction from sea urchin embryos at the pluteus stage, providing a new resource for this established model marine organism."
https://openalex.org/W2588302279,"Gene Ontology (GO) classification of statistically significantly differentially expressed genes is commonly used to interpret transcriptomics data as a part of functional genomic analysis. In this approach, all significantly expressed genes contribute equally to the final GO classification regardless of their actual expression levels. Gene expression levels can significantly affect protein production and hence should be reflected in GO term enrichment. Genes with low expression levels can also participate in GO term enrichment through cumulative effects. In this report, we have introduced a new GO enrichment method that is suitable for multiple samples and time series experiments that uses a statistical outlier test to detect GO categories with special patterns of variation that can potentially identify candidate biological mechanisms. To demonstrate the value of our approach, we have performed two case studies. Whole transcriptome expression profiles of Salmonella enteritidis and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) were analysed in order to determine GO term enrichment across the entire transcriptome instead of a subset of differentially expressed genes used in traditional GO analysis. Our result highlights the key role of inflammation related functional groups in AD pathology as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor binding, neuromedin U binding, and interleukin were remarkably upregulated in AD brain when all using all of the gene expression data in the transcriptome. Mitochondrial components and the molybdopterin synthase complex were identified as potential key cellular components involved in AD pathology."
https://openalex.org/W2587873959,"Human norovirus (HNoV), a positive-sense RNA virus, is the main causative agent of acute viral gastroenteritis. Multiple pandemic variants of the genogroup II genotype 4 (GII.4) of NoV have attracted great attention from researchers worldwide. However, novel variants of GII.17 have been overtaking those pandemic variants in some areas of East Asia. To investigate the environmental occurrence of GII in South Korea, we collected water samples from coastal streams and a neighboring waste water treatment plant in North Jeolla province (in March, July, and December of 2015). Based on capsid gene region C analysis, four different genotypes (GII.4, GII.13, GII.17, and GII.21) were detected, with much higher prevalence of GII.17 than of GII.4. Additional sequence analyses of the ORF1-ORF2 junction and ORF2 from the water samples revealed that the GII.17 sequences in this study were closely related to the novel strains of GII.P17-GII.17, the main causative variants of the 2014–2015 HNoV outbreak in China and Japan. In addition, the GII.P21-GII.21 variants were identified in this study and they had new amino acid sequence variations in the blockade epitopes of the P2 domain. From these results, we present two important findings: 1) the novel GII.P17-GII.17 variants appeared to be predominant in the study area, and 2) new GII.21 variants have emerged in South Korea."

However, the latter priority has rarely been examined in routing strategy studies. In this paper, a novel routing algorithm, which is based on the efficient path routing strategy (EP), is proposed to overcome network congestion problem caused by large amount of traffic flows with different priorities. In this scheme, traffic flows with different priorities are transmitted through different routing paths, which are based on EP with different parameters. Simulation results show that the traffic capacity for flows with different priorities can be enhanced by 12% with this method, compared with EP. In addition, the new method contributes to more balanced network traffic load distribution and reduces average transmission jump and delay of packets."
https://openalex.org/W2588137067,"Hemodialysis (HD) patients face increased fracture risk, which is further associated with elevated risk of hospitalization and mortality. High-resolution peripheral computed tomography (HR-pQCT) has advanced our understanding of bone disease in chronic kidney disease by characterizing distinct changes in both the cortical and trabecular compartments. Increased cortical porosity (Ct.Po) has been shown to be associated with fracture in patients with osteopenia or in postmenopausal diabetic women. We tested whether the degree of Ct.Po identifies hemodialysis patients with prevalent fragility fractures in comparison to bone mineral density (BMD) assessed by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). We performed a post-hoc analysis of a cross-sectional study in 76 prevalent hemodialysis patients. Markers of mineral metabolism, coronary calcification score, DXA-, and HR-pQCT-data were analyzed, and Ct.Po determined at radius and tibia. Ct.Po was significantly higher in patients with fracture but association was lost after adjusting for age and gender (tibia p = 0.228, radius p = 0.5). Instead, femoral (F) BMD neck area (p = 0.03), F T-score neck area (p = 0.03), radius (R) BMD (p = 0.03), R T-score (p = 0.03), and cortical HR-pQCT indices such as cortical area (Ct.Ar) (tibia: p = 0.01; radius: p = 0.02) and cortical thickness (Ct.Th) (tibia: p = 0.03; radius: p = 0.02) correctly classified patients with fragility fractures. Area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) for Ct.Po (tibia AUC: 0.711; p = 0.01; radius AUC: 0.666; p = 0.04), Ct.Ar (tibia AUC: 0.832; p<0.001; radius AUC: 0.796; p<0.001), and F neck BMD (AUC: 0.758; p = 0.002) did not differ significantly among each other. In conclusion, measuring Ct.Po is not superior to BMD determined by DXA for identification of HD patients with fragility fracture."
https://openalex.org/W2588505928,"Viral load testing is considered the gold standard for monitoring HIV treatment; however, given its high cost, some patients cannot afford viral load testing if this testing is not subsidized. Since foreign aid for HIV/AIDS in Vietnam is rapidly decreasing, we sought to assess willingness to pay (WTP) for viral load and CD4 cell count tests among HIV-positive patients, and identified factors that might inform future co-payment schemes.A multi-site cross-sectional survey was conducted with 1133 HIV-positive patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Hanoi and Nam Dinh. Patients' health insurance coverage, quality of life, and history of illicit drug use were assessed. A contingent valuation approach was employed to measure patients' WTP for CD4 cell count and viral load testing.HIV-positive patients receiving ART at provincial sites reported more difficulty obtaining health insurance (HI) and had the overall the poorest quality of life. Most patients (90.9%) were willing to pay for CD4 cell count testing; here, the mean WTP was valued at US$8.2 (95%CI = 7.6-8.8 US$) per test. Most patients (87.3%) were also willing to pay for viral load testing; here, mean WTP was valued at US$18.6 (95%CI = 16.3-20.9 US$) per test. High income, high education level, and hospitalization were positively associated with WTP, while co-morbidity with psychiatric symptoms and trouble paying for health insurance were both negatively related to WTP.These findings raise concerns that HIV-positive patients in Vietnam might have low WTP for CD4 cell count and viral load testing. This means that without foreign financial subsidies, many of these patients would likely go without these important tests. Treating psychiatric co-morbidities, promoting healthcare services utilization, and removing barriers to accessing health insurance may increase WTP for monitoring of HIV/AIDS treatment among HIV+-positive Vietnamese patients."
https://openalex.org/W2588541189,"Low-severity fires that killed few canopy trees played a significant historical role in dry forests of the western USA and warrant restoration and management, but historical rates of burning remain uncertain. Past reconstructions focused on on dating fire years, not measuring historical rates of burning. Past statistics, including mean composite fire interval (mean CFI) and individual-tree fire interval (mean ITFI) have biases and inaccuracies if used as estimators of rates. In this study, I used regression, with a calibration dataset of 96 cases, to test whether these statistics could accurately predict two equivalent historical rates, population mean fire interval (PMFI) and fire rotation (FR). The best model, using Weibull mean ITFI, had low prediction error and R2adj = 0.972. I used this model to predict historical PMFI/FR at 252 sites spanning dry forests. Historical PMFI/FR for a pool of 342 calibration and predicted sites had a mean of 39 years and median of 30 years. Short (< 25 years) mean PMFI/FRs were in Arizona and New Mexico and scattered in other states. Long (> 55 years) mean PMFI/FRs were mainly from northern New Mexico to South Dakota. Mountain sites often had a large range in PMFI/FR. Nearly all 342 estimates are for old forests with a history of primarily low-severity fire, found across only about 34% of historical dry-forest area. Frequent fire (PMFI/FR < 25 years) was found across only about 14% of historical dry-forest area, with 86% having multidecadal rates of low-severity fire. Historical fuels (e.g., understory shrubs and small trees) could fully recover between multidecadal fires, allowing some denser forests and some ecosystem processes and wildlife habitat to be less limited by fire. Lower historical rates mean less restoration treatment is needed before beginning managed fire for resource benefits, where feasible. Mimicking patterns of variability in historical low-severity fire regimes would likely benefit biological diversity and ecosystem functioning."
https://openalex.org/W2588549754,"Endurance exercise is a remarkable intervention for the treatment of many diseases. Mitochondrial changes on skeletal muscle are likely important for many of the benefits provided by exercise. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects that a regular physical activity (swimming without workload) has on mitochondrial morphological alterations and glucometabolic parameters induced by a high-sugar diet (HSD). Weaned male Wistar rats fed with a standard diet or a HSD (68% carbohydrate) were subjected to 60 minutes of regular physical activity by swimming (without workload) for four- (20 sessions) or eight-week (40 sessions) periods. After training, animals were euthanized and the sera, adipose tissues, and skeletal muscles were collected for further analysis. The HSD increased body weight after an 8-week period; it also increased the fat pads and the adipose index, resulting in glucose intolerance and insulin resistance (IR). Transmission electron microscopy showed an increase in alterations of mitochondrial ultrastructure in the gastrocnemius muscle, as well as a decrease in superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and an increase in protein carbonylation. Regular physical activity partially reverted these alterations in rats fed a HSD, preventing mitochondrial morphological alterations and IR. Moreover, we observed a decrease in Pgc1α expression (qPCR analysis) in STD-EXE group and a less pronounced reduction in HSD-EXE group after an 8-week period. Thus, regular physical activity (swimming without workload) in rats fed a HSD can prevent mitochondrial dysfunction and IR, highlighting the crucial role for physical activity on metabolic homeostasis."

Therefore, it is unclear whether and how these two related pathways are coordinated to maintain lipid balance in fission yeast. Previously, we showed that Sre1 cleavage is defective in the absence of mga2. Here, we report that this defect is due to deficient unsaturated fatty acid synthesis, resulting in aberrant membrane transport. This defect is recapitulated by treatment with the fatty acid synthase inhibitor cerulenin and is rescued by addition of exogenous unsaturated fatty acids. Furthermore, sterol synthesis inhibition blocks Mga2 pathway activation.

https://openalex.org/W2588605172,"Mycoplasma pneumoniae is strongly associated with new onset asthma and asthma exacerbations. Until recently, the molecular mechanisms utilized by M. pneumoniae to influence asthma symptoms were unknown. However, we recently reported that an ADP-ribosylating and vacuolating toxin called the Community Acquired Respiratory Distress Syndrome toxin, CARDS toxin, produced by M. pneumoniae was sufficient to promote allergic inflammation and asthma-like disease in mice. A mouse model of CARDS toxin exposure was used to evaluate total and CARDS-toxin specific serum IgE responses. Mast cell sensitization, challenge, and degranulation studies determined functionality of the CARDS toxin-specific IgE. In the current study, we report that a single mucosal exposure to CARDS toxin was sufficient to increase total serum IgE and CARDS toxin-specific IgE in mice. Mice given a second mucosal challenge of CARDS toxin responded with significant increases in total and CARDS toxin-specific IgE. CARDS toxin-specific IgE bound to an N-terminal peptide of CARDS toxin but not the C-terminal peptide. Likewise, full-length CARDS toxin and the N-terminal peptide induced mast cell degranulation. Altogether, these data demonstrate that exposure to CARDS toxin is sufficient to generate functional IgE in mice. M. pneumoniae and CARDS toxin are strongly associated with asthma exacerbations raising the possibility that the CARDS toxin-specific IgE-mast cell axis contributes to disease pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2588834135,"DNA barcoding relies on short and standardized gene regions to identify species. The agricultural and horticultural applications of barcoding such as for marketplace regulation and copyright protection remain poorly explored. This study examines the effectiveness of the standard plant barcode markers (matK and rbcL) for the identification of plant species in private and public nurseries in northern Egypt. These two markers were sequenced from 225 specimens of 161 species and 62 plant families of horticultural importance. The sequence recovery was similar for rbcL (96.4%) and matK (84%), but the number of specimens assigned correctly to the respective genera and species was lower for rbcL (75% and 29%) than matK (85% and 40%). The combination of rbcL and matK brought the number of correct generic and species assignments to 83.4% and 40%, respectively. Individually, the efficiency of both markers varied among different plant families; for example, all palm specimens (Arecaceae) were correctly assigned to species while only one individual of Asteraceae was correctly assigned to species. Further, barcodes reliably assigned ornamental horticultural and medicinal plants correctly to genus while they showed a lower or no success in assigning these plants to species and cultivars. For future, we recommend the combination of a complementary barcode (e.g. ITS or trnH-psbA) with rbcL + matK to increase the performance of taxa identification. By aiding species identification of horticultural crops and ornamental palms, the analysis of the barcode regions will have large impact on horticultural industry."
https://openalex.org/W2588335170,"Geographic heterogeneity of human papillomavirus (HPV) involvement in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has been observed over the last few years. This trend has not been evaluated in the Philippines. Hence, this study aims to provide for the first time a data on the prevalence of HPV in HNSCC in the northwestern region of the Philippines.Two hundred one (201) biopsy samples (179 formalin fixed paraffin embedded and 22 fresh frozen) from 163 Filipino HNSCC cases (oral cavity = 88; larynx = 60; oropharynx = 15) diagnosed between 2003 to 2013 were initially included in this study. HPV DNA was detected by two methods: (1) BSGP5+/6+-PCR/ multiplex human papillomavirus genotyping and (2) TaqMan probes-based real-time qPCR. Presence of HPV type-specific transcripts were also analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR with subsequent hybridization to oligonucleotide probes coupled to Luminex beads. Co-amplification of the β-globin and ubiquitin C genes served as internal positive controls for DNA and RNA analyses, respectively.Of the 163, 82 (50.3%) cases had at least one tissue sample that was valid for molecular analysis. Only two of the DNA valid cases (2.4%) were HPV DNA-positive (HPV11 and HPV33). All HPV mRNA assays rendered negative results except for HPV11 transcripts. Results of this study may indicate that there is probably very low prevalence of HPV-associated HNSCC among Filipino adults living in a rural region of the Philippines. This study could serve as a benchmark for designing follow-up studies that would assess possible changes in trends of HNSCC among Filipinos in different ethnic regions of the country, especially urban areas in which the population is expected to adapt Western style sexual behavior. A prospective sampling of fresh frozen tissue is also highly recommended to ensure better molecular analyses."
https://openalex.org/W2588467437,"This study investigated the effects of a single amoxicillin treatment of newborn piglets on the prevalence of hernias and abscesses until the age of nine weeks. We also studied whether the treatment was associated with growth and mortality, the need for treatment of other diseases, the proportions of ampicillin resistant coliforms and antimicrobial resistance patterns of intestinal Escherichia coli (E. coli). A total of 7156 piglets, from approximately 480 litters, were divided into two treatment groups: ANT (N = 3661) and CON (N = 3495), where piglets were treated with or without a single intramuscular injection of 75 mg amoxicillin one day after birth, respectively. The umbilical and inguinal areas of weaned pigs were palpated at four and nine weeks of age. At the same time, altogether 124 pigs with hernias or abscesses and 820 non-defective pigs from three pens per batch were weighed individually. Mortality and the need to treat piglets for other diseases were recorded. Piglet faecal samples were collected from three areas of the floors of each pen at four weeks of age. The prevalence of umbilical hernias or abscesses did not differ between the groups at four weeks of age, but it was higher in the CON group than in the ANT group at nine weeks of age (2.3% vs. 0.7%, P < 0.05). Numbers of inguinal hernias and abscesses did not differ between the groups at four or nine weeks of age. The ANT group, when it compared with the CON group, increased the weight gain between four and nine weeks of age (LS means ± SE; 497.5 g/d ± 5.0 vs. 475.3 g/d ± 4.9, P < 0.01), and decreased piglet mortality (19.5% ± 1.0 vs. 6.9% ± 1.0, P < 0.05) and the need to treat the piglets for leg problems (3.4% ± 0.3 vs. 1.9% ± 0.3%, P < 0.01) but not for other diseases by the age of four weeks. The proportion of ampicillin resistant intestinal coliform bacteria and the resistance patterns of the E. coli isolates were not different between the ANT and CON groups. In conclusion, our results showed that the amoxicillin treatment of new-born piglets produced statistically significant effect in some of the parameters studied. However, as these effects were only minor, we did not find grounds to recommend preventive antibiotic treatment. Further, continuous antimicrobial treatment of newborn piglets could negatively influence the development of the normal microbiota of the piglet and promote selection of antimicrobial resistance genes in herds. Therefore we suggest rejection of the use of routine administration of antimicrobial agents at birth."
https://openalex.org/W2587934915,"There is limited evidence to support the effectiveness of falls prevention interventions in the acute hospital setting. The 6-PACK falls prevention program includes a fall-risk tool; ‘falls alert’ signs; supervision of patients in the bathroom; ensuring patients’ walking aids are within reach; toileting regimes; low-low beds; and bed/chair alarms. This study explored the acceptability of the 6-PACK program from the perspective of nurses and senior staff prior to its implementation in a randomised controlled trial. A mixed-methods approach was applied involving 24 acute wards from six Australian hospitals. Participants were nurses working on participating wards and senior hospital staff including: Nurse Unit Managers; senior physicians; Directors of Nursing; and senior personnel involved in quality and safety or falls prevention. Information on program acceptability (suitability, practicality and benefits) was obtained by surveys, focus groups and interviews. Survey data were analysed descriptively, and focus group and interview data thematically. The survey response rate was 60%. Twelve focus groups (n = 96 nurses) and 24 interviews with senior staff were conducted. Falls were identified as a priority patient safety issue and nurses as key players in falls prevention. The 6-PACK program was perceived to offer practical benefits compared to current practice. Nurses agreed fall-risk tools, low-low beds and alert signs were useful for preventing falls (>70%). Views were mixed regarding positioning patients’ walking aid within reach. Practical issues raised included access to equipment; and risk of staff injury with low-low bed use. Bathroom supervision was seen to be beneficial, however not always practical. Views on the program appropriateness and benefits were consistent across nurses and senior staff. Staff perceived the 6-PACK program as suitable, practical and beneficial, and were open to adopting the program. Some practical concerns were raised highlighting issues to be addressed by the implementation plan."
https://openalex.org/W2587878504,"Background Hospital discharge databases are used to study the epidemiology of Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) among hospitalized patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). CDI in IBD is increasingly important and accurately estimating its occurrence is critical in understanding its comorbidity. There are limited data on the reliability of the International Classification of Diseases 10th revision (ICD-10) (now widely used in North America) CDI code in determining occurrence of CDI among hospitalized patients. We compared the performance of ICD-10 CDI coding to laboratory confirmed CDI diagnoses. Methods The University of Manitoba IBD Epidemiology Database was used to identify individuals with and without IBD discharged with CDI diagnoses between 07/01/2005 and 3/31/2014. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of ICD-10 CDI code was compared to laboratory CDI diagnoses recorded in a province wide CDI dataset. Multivariable logistic regression models were performed to test the predictors of diagnostic inaccuracy of ICD-10 CDI code. Results There were 273 episodes of laboratory confirmed CDI (hospitalized and non-hospitalized) among 7396 individuals with IBD and 536 among 66,297 matched controls. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of ICD-10 CDI code in discharge abstracts was 72.8%, 99.6%, 64.1% and 99.7% among those with IBD and 70.8%, 99.9%, 79.0% and 99.9% among those without IBD. Predictors of diagnostic inaccuracy included IBD, older age, increased co-morbidity and earlier years of hospitalization. Conclusions Identification of CDI using ICD-10 CDI code in hospital discharge abstracts may not identify up to 30% of CDI cases, with worse performance among those with IBD."

Quantitative PCR and Western blot analyses highlighted the presence of KRT14 (mRNA and protein) only in human lung samples with DAD or interstitial lung disease (ILD). In the exponentially growing cell lines A549 and H441, the mRNA and protein levels of KRT14 peaked at day one after cell seeding and decreased at day two, opposite to what observed for the proliferation marker E2F1. The inverse relation of KRT14 versus E2F1 expression holds true also for other proliferative markers, such as cyclin E1 and cyclin D1. Of interest, we also found that E2F1 silencing caused cell cycle arrest and increased KRT14 expression, whilst E2F1 stimulation induced cell cycle progression and decreased KRT14. KRT14 also increased in proliferative pneumocytes (HPAEpiC) just before transdifferentiation. Overall, our results suggest that KRT14 is a viable biomarker of pneumocyte activation, and repair/regeneration. The involvement of KRT14 in regenerative process may suggest a novel pharmaceutical target to accelerate lung repair."
https://openalex.org/W2588186871,"Introduction Quantification of cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is crucial in animal studies as well as clinical routine. We have developed a method for computer-based volumetric assessment of intracranial blood vessels from cross-sectional imaging data. Here we demonstrate the quantification of vasospasm from micro computed tomography (micro-CT) data in a rodent SAH model and the transferability of the volumetric approach to clinical data. Methods We obtained rodent data by performing an ex vivo micro-CT of murine brains after sham surgery or SAH by endovascular filament perforation on day 3 post hemorrhage. Clinical CT angiography (CTA) was performed for diagnostic reasons unrelated to this study. We digitally reconstructed and segmented intracranial vascular trees, followed by calculating volumes of defined vessel segments by standardized protocols using Amira® software. Results SAH animals demonstrated significantly smaller vessel diameters compared with sham (MCA: 134.4±26.9μm vs.165.0±18.7μm, p<0.05). We could highlight this difference by analyzing vessel volumes of a defined MCA-ICA segment (SAH: 0.044±0.017μl vs. sham: 0.07±0.006μl, p<0.001). Analysis of clinical CTA data allowed us to detect and volumetrically quantify vasospasm in a series of 5 SAH patients. Vessel diameters from digital reconstructions correlated well with those measured microscopically (rodent data, correlation coefficient 0.8, p<0.001), or angiographically (clinical data, 0.9, p<0.001). Conclusions Our methodological approach provides accurate anatomical reconstructions of intracranial vessels from cross-sectional imaging data. It allows volumetric assessment of entire vessel segments, hereby highlighting vasospasm-induced changes objectively in a murine SAH model. This method could also be a helpful tool for analysis of clinical CTA."

IOP change between baseline and 3 months post-op was defined as the primary efficacy variable. Secondary efficacy variables included the number of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) injections, needlings, suture lyses, preoperative IOP change, hypertension rate and change of conjunctival redness 3 and 6 months post-op. Safety was assessed based on the documentation of adverse events.Preoperative treatment with topical dorzolamide/timolol was non-inferior to oral acetazolamide and topical dexamethasone in terms of IOP reduction 3 months after trabeculectomy (adjusted means -8.12 mmHg versus -8.30 mmHg; Difference: 0.18; 95% CI -1.91 to 2.26, p = 0.8662). Similar results were found 6 months after trabeculectomy (-9.13 mmHg versus -9.06 mmHg; p = 0.9401). Comparable results were also shown for both groups concerning the classification of the filtering bleb, corneal staining, and numbers of treatments with 5-FU, needlings and suture lyses. More patients reported AEs in the acetazolamide/dexamethasone group than in the dorzolamide/timolol group.Preoperative, preservative-free, fixed-dose dorzolamide/timolol seems to be equally effective as preoperative acetazolamide and dexamethasone and has a favourable safety profile."
https://openalex.org/W2588135631,"Purpose An autoantibody against aquaporin-4 (AQP4 Ab) is highly specific for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder and plays a pathogenic role in this disease. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of AQP4 Ab on inner retinal structure, function, and the structure−function relationships in eyes with optic neuritis. Methods Thirty five eyes from 25 cases who had received visual function tests and RTVue optical coherence tomography (OCT) measurement at least six months after the latest episode of optic neuritis were enrolled. Patients with multiple sclerosis were excluded. AQP4 Ab was measured using a cell-based assay. Visual acuity, mean deviation (MD) of the Humphrey visual field SITA standard 30–2 tests, retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), ganglion cell complex (GCC) thicknesses, and other clinical variables were compared between the AQP4 Ab-positive and -negative groups. Parameters associated with visual functions were evaluated by generalized estimating equation (GEE) models. Results The AQP4 Ab-positive group (20 eyes from 12 cases) had a higher proportion of bilateral involvement and longer duration of follow-up than the AQP4 Ab-negative group (15 eyes from 13 cases). Linear mixed effect models revealed worse MD and visual acuity in AQP4 Ab-positive eyes than those in AQP4 Ab-negative eyes after adjusting for within-patient inter-eye dependence, whereas there were no differences in RNFL and GCC thickness between the two groups. In seropositive eyes, GEE regression analyses revealed that depending on age and the number of recurrences of ON episodes, OCT parameters correlated strongly with MD and more weakly with visual acuity. Conclusions Reductions in RNFL and GCC thickness were proportional to the visual field defect in eyes with AQP4 Ab but not in eyes without AQP4 Ab. The presence of AQP4 Ab probably plays a critical role in retinal ganglion cell loss in optic neuritis."
https://openalex.org/W2588152733,"Children with complex chronic conditions (CCC) are presumed to be vulnerable to adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The clinical profiles of ADRs in CCC are not well known. Herein, we aim to describe the ADR profiles in CCC with regard to typical presentations and vulnerable groups. We accessed the ADR yearly reports at a tertiary children's hospital whose practice is mainly dedicated to CCC and descriptively analyzed their clinical profiles according to the presence of a complex chronic condition, ADR severity, and age groups. A total of 1841 cases were analyzed, among which 1258 (68.3%) were mild, 493 (26.8%) moderate, and 90 (4.9%) cases were severe. A total of 1581 (85.9%) cases of complex chronic condition were reported. The proportion of CCC in each severity group increased as the ADR becomes more severe. In CCC, ADRs were most frequently reported by nurses in the adolescent group and in cases where the symptoms involved the gastrointestinal system. The class of antineoplastic and immunomodulating drugs was the most commonly suspected of causing an ADR, followed by one of the antibiotics. When we focus on the trend across the age groups, the ratio of severe-to-total ADRs decreased with older age. Among severe cases, the ratio of off-label prescription-related cases was the highest in the infant/toddler group and decreased as the groups aged. In conclusion, ADRs of CCCs admitted to a tertiary children's hospital have a unique profile. These groups are vulnerable to ADRs and thus they should be monitored closely, especially when they are infants or toddlers, so that severe ADRs can be identified and treated immediately."
https://openalex.org/W2588165735,"Transglutaminase 2 (TG2) is a multifunctional protein that is primarily engaged in cell adhesion/signaling or shows Ca2+-dependent transglutaminase activity in the extracellular space of tissues. This latter action leads to the cross-linking of the extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. The enhanced extracellular expression of TG2 is associated with processes such as wound healing, fibrosis or vascular remodeling that are also characterized by a high deposition of dermatan sulfate (DS) proteoglycans in the ECM. However, it is unknown whether DS may bind to TG2 or affect its function. Using the plasmon surface resonance method, we showed that DS chains, especially those of biglycan, are good binding partners for TG2. The interaction has some requirements as to the DS structure. The competitive effect of heparin on DS binding to TG2 suggests that both glycosaminoglycans occupy the same binding site(s) on the protein molecule. An occurrence of the DS-TG2 interaction was confirmed by the co-immunoprecipitation of this protein with native decorin that is a DS-bearing proteoglycan rather than with the decorin core protein. Moreover, in vivo DS is responsible for both TG2 binding and the regulation of the location of this protein in the ECM as can be suggested from an increased extraction of TG2 from the human fascia only when an enzymatic degradation of the tissue DS was conducted in the presence of the anti-collagen type I antiserum. In addition, DS with a low affinity for TG2 exerted an inhibitory effect on the protein transamidating activity most probably via the control of the accessibility of a substrate. Our data show that DS can affect several aspects of TG2 biology in both physiological and pathological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2589122886,"Neuroinflammation and oxidative stress are hallmarks of various neurological diseases. However, whether and how the redox processes control neuroinflammation is incompletely understood. We hypothesized that increasing cellular glutathione (GSH) levels would inhibit neuroinflammation. A series of thiol compounds were identified to elevate cellular GSH levels by a novel approach (i.e. post-translational activation of glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL), the rate-limiting enzyme in GSH biosynthesis). These small thiol-containing compounds were examined for their ability to increase intracellular GSH levels in a murine microglial cell line (BV2), of which dimercaprol (2,3-dimercapto-1-propanol (DMP)) was found to be the most effective compound. DMP increased GCL activity and decreased LPS-induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inducible nitric-oxide synthase induction in BV2 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. The ability of DMP to elevate GSH levels and attenuate LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine production was inhibited by buthionine sulfoximine, an inhibitor of GCL. DMP increased the expression of GCL holoenzyme without altering the expression of its subunits or Nrf2 target proteins (NQO1 and HO-1), suggesting a post-translational mechanism. DMP attenuated LPS-induced MAPK activation in BV2 cells, suggesting the MAPK pathway as the signaling mechanism underlying the effect of DMP. Finally, the ability of DMP to increase GSH via GCL activation was observed in mixed cerebrocortical cultures and N27 dopaminergic cells. Together, the data demonstrate a novel mechanism of GSH elevation by post-translational activation of GCL. Post-translational activation of GCL offers a novel targeted approach to control inflammation in chronic neuronal disorders associated with impaired adaptive responses.

https://openalex.org/W2588912467,"In eukaryotes, the basal transcription in interphase is orchestrated through the regulation by kinases (Kin28, Bur1, and Ctk1) and phosphatases (Ssu72, Rtr1, and Fcp1), which act through the post-translational modification of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II. The CTD comprises the repeated Tyr-Ser-Pro-Thr-Ser-Pro-Ser motif with potential epigenetic modification sites. Despite the observation of transcription and periodic expression of genes during mitosis with entailing CTD phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, the associated CTD specific kinase(s) and its role in transcription remains unknown. Here we have identified Cdc15 as a potential kinase phosphorylating Ser-2 and Ser-5 of CTD for transcription during mitosis in the budding yeast. The phosphorylation of CTD by Cdc15 is independent of any prior Ser phosphorylation(s). The inactivation of Cdc15 causes reduction of global CTD phosphorylation during mitosis and affects the expression of genes whose transcript levels peak during mitosis. Cdc15 also influences the complete transcription of clb2 gene and phosphorylates Ser-5 at the promoter and Ser-2 toward the 3′ end of the gene. The observation that Cdc15 could phosphorylate Ser-5, as well as Ser-2, during transcription in mitosis is in contrast to the phosphorylation marks put by the kinases in interphase (G1, S, and G2), where Cdck7/Kin28 phosphorylates Ser-5 at promoter and Bur1/Ctk1 phosphorylates Ser-2 at the 3′ end of the genes.

https://openalex.org/W2588000251,"In order to mitigate against possible impacts of seismic surveys on baleen whales it is important to know as much as possible about the presence of whales within the vicinity of seismic operations. This study expands on previous work that analyzes single seismic streamer data to locate nearby calling baleen whales with a grid search method that utilizes the propagation angles and relative arrival times of received signals along the streamer. Three dimensional seismic reflection surveys use multiple towed hydrophone arrays for imaging the structure beneath the seafloor, providing an opportunity to significantly improve the uncertainty associated with streamer-generated call locations. All seismic surveys utilizing airguns conduct visual marine mammal monitoring surveys concurrent with the experiment, with powering-down of seismic source if a marine mammal is observed within the exposure zone. This study utilizes data from power-down periods of a seismic experiment conducted with two 8-km long seismic hydrophone arrays by the R/V Marcus G. Langseth near Alaska in summer 2011. Simulated and experiment data demonstrate that a single streamer can be utilized to resolve left-right ambiguity because the streamer is rarely perfectly straight in a field setting, but dual streamers provides significantly improved locations. Both methods represent a dramatic improvement over the existing Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) system for detecting low frequency baleen whale calls, with ~60 calls detected utilizing the seismic streamers, zero of which were detected using the current R/V Langseth PAM system. Furthermore, this method has the potential to be utilized not only for improving mitigation processes, but also for studying baleen whale behavior within the vicinity of seismic operations."
https://openalex.org/W2588398605,"1-Trichloromethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-β-carboline (TaClo) has been widely studied as a neurotoxic substance, however, only few reports have explored its effect on carcinogenicity. Since the aberrant modification of DNA methylation occurs very early in almost all human cancers, the focus of this study is to assess the carcinogenicity of TaClo by characterizing alterations of the epigenetic state, specifically, DNA methylation, upon exposure to TaClo in a HEK 293 model cell line. Our results suggest that TaClo could induce global DNA hypomethylation and transcriptional repression of critical tumor suppressor genes by increasing their promoter methylation. Enhanced cell proliferation, migration and anchorage independent growth were observed in cells exposed to TaClo. Our study highlights the epigenetic toxicity of TaClo, which contributes to its carcinogenicity by altering the DNA methylation status."
https://openalex.org/W2589053422,"Synaptic activity is regulated and limited by blood flow, which is controlled by blood vessel dilation and contraction. Traditionally, the study of neurovascular coupling has mainly focused on energy consumption and oxygen delivery. However, the mechanical changes that blood vessel movements induce in the surrounding tissue have not been considered. We have modeled the mechanical changes that movements of blood vessels cause in neighboring synapses. Our simulations indicate that synaptic densities increase or decrease during vascular dilation and contraction, respectively, near the blood vessel walls. This phenomenon may alter the concentration of neurotransmitters and vasoactive substances in the immediate vicinity of the vessel wall and thus may have an influence on local blood flow."
