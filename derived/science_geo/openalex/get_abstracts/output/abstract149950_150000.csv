TNFα promotes multipotential signal transduction cascades, including the activation of the Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK). Endogenous JNK associates with IRS-1 in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Anisomycin, a strong activator of JNK in these cells, stimulates the activity of JNK bound to IRS-1 and inhibits the insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1. Serine 307 is a major site of JNK phosphorylation in IRS-1. Mutation of serine 307 to alanine eliminates phosphorylation of IRS-1 by JNK and abrogates the inhibitory effect of TNFα on insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1. These results suggest that phosphorylation of serine 307 might mediate, at least partially, the inhibitory effect of proinflammatory cytokines like TNFα on IRS-1 function.

So far, genetic approaches provide important insight into certain early onset forms of diabetes but fail to explain insulin resistance that is associated with common type 2 diabetes (1.Hani E.H.

Recent results support the notion that dysregulation of the insulin receptor and reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of the IRS1 proteins might contribute significantly to peripheral insulin resistance and β-cell failure (5.Withers D.J.

The principal insulin receptor substrates, IRS-1 and IRS-2, are phosphorylated on multiple tyrosine residues by the activated receptors for insulin, IGF-1, and various other cytokines (7.Yenush L. White M.F. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2 promotes their binding to the Src homology 2 domains in various downstream signaling proteins, including the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), Grb-2, SHP2, and others (7.Yenush L. White M.F. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 8.Myers Jr., M.G. White M.F. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 643-650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During association with IRS proteins, PI 3-kinase is activated, and its phospholipid products promote the recruitment of various serine kinases to the plasma membrane, where they are activated by phosphorylation (9.Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Curr. Opin. Gene. 1998; 8: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). One of the membrane-associated kinases, protein kinase B/Akt, phosphorylates multiple downstream effectors that promote diverse biological responses, including stimulation of glucose transport, protein and glycogen synthesis, and the regulation of gene expression, which affects cellular proliferation and survival (10.Alessi D.R.

However, the mechanism by which serine phosphorylation inhibits insulin signaling is difficult to establish, because IRS-1 contains more than 70 potential serine/threonine residues in consensus sequences for many protein kinases, including casein kinase II, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase C, Cdc2 kinase, MAP kinase, and protein kinase B/Akt (14.Li J.

The action of proinflammatory cytokines like TNFα or interleukin-1β to promote serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 might provide a common mechanism for insulin/IGF-1 resistance observed during acute trauma and chronic obesity (21.Feuerstein G.Z.

TNFα is produced systemically by macrophages and lymphocytes after inflammatory stimulation or trauma and increases rapidly during experimental injury induced by cerebral ischemic, excitotoxic, and traumatic injury (27.Loddick S.A. Rothwell N.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9449-9451Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Moreover, obese animals and humans also produce TNFα in positive correlation to body mass index and hyperglycemia, an indirect measure of insulin resistance (23.Hotamisligil G.S. Spiegelman B.M.

During chronic obesity or sudden trauma, insulin receptor kinase activity and tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 are reduced in skeletal muscle; however, in each case dephosphorylation of IRS-1 by incubation in vitro with alkaline phosphatase restores its ability to undergo tyrosine phosphorylation by the activated insulin receptor (28.Hotamisligil G.S.

TNFα receptor null mice display less insulin resistance during diet-induced obesity, suggesting that TNFα signals promote, at least partially, the inhibition of IRS-1 function in mice (31.Hotamisligil G.S.

Moreover, TNFα treatment of adipocytes increases serine phosphorylation of IRS-proteins, which inhibits insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation and impairs insulin signaling (28.Hotamisligil G.S.

These results suggest that serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 promotes an inhibitory effect of proinflammatory cytokines on insulin receptor signaling (30.Ikezu T. Okamoto T. Yonezawa K. Tompkins R.G.

The identification of the serine kinases that phosphorylate IRS proteins during acute trauma and chronic obesity is an essential step for learning how to reverse the insulin resistance that perturbs metabolic homeostasis and contributes to diabetes. The JNK signaling pathway is implicated in many biological responses, including mammalian embryogenesis and the response to stress (35.Kuan C.Y. Yang D.D. Samanta Roy D.R. Davis R.J. Rakic P.

J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1817-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). During TNFα binding, the tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 trimerizes, which promotes the assembly of a multicomponent complex that activates the JNK signaling cascade (37.Yuasa T. Ohno S. Kehrl J.H. Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22681-22692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Activated JNK phosphorylates many cellular proteins, including components of the AP-1 transcription factor complex (38.Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar). Here we provide evidence to support the hypothesis that JNK associates with IRS-1 and promotes the phosphorylation of Ser307 near the PTB domain. Our results suggest that phosphorylation of Ser307 by JNK or another related kinase might mediate the inhibitory effects of TNFα on insulin signal transduction. Phosphospecific antibodies were purchased from New England Biolabs. Antibodies against IRS-1, IRS-2, and p85 were described previously (39.Sun X.J. Wang L.M. Zhang Y. Yenush L. Myers Jr., M.G.

Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells overexpressing the human insulin receptor were described previously (45.Sun X.J. Miralpeix M. Myers Jr., M.G. Glasheen E.M. Backer J.M. Kahn C.R. White M.F. J. Biol.

Stable CHO cell lines expressing murine IRS-1 or murine IRS-2 were generated by Fugene-6-mediated transfection of pCMVHis containing the appropriate inserts (Roche Molecular Biochemicals); 32D cell transfectants were generated by electroporation. In each case, transfected cells were selected in histidinol as described previously (47.Yenush L. Zanella C. Uchida T. Bernal D. White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6784-6794Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). CHO cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 5 mm histidinol and made quiescent by serum starvation for 12 h, whereas 32D cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 5% WEHI conditioned medium (as a source of interleukin-3), and 5 mm histidinol and made quiescent by serum starvation for 4 h. HEK 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and made quiescent by serum starvation for 12 h. CHO and 32D cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), containing 130 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaF, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 100 μm NaVO4, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin. Immunoprecipitations were performed for 2 h at 4 °C and collected on protein A-Sepharose. Lysates and immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose, and proteins were detected by immunoblotting/125I-labeled protein A and analysis on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. 293 cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4) containing 137 mm NaCl, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm benzamidine, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. Cell lysates from CHOIR/IRS-1 cells treated with anisomycin were incubated with 20 units of alkaline phosphatase at 37 °C for 1 h. The dephosphorylation reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer and boiling. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and analyzed by Western blot using antibodies against IRS-1(47). GST fusion proteins containing portions of IRS-1 were made by subcloning the indicated residues into pGex-2TK (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), expressed inEscherichia coli (BL-21) and purified using glutathione-agarose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GST fusion proteins (111 pmol) were incubated with 293 cell lysates for 2 h at 4 °C. Where indicated, experiments were performed in the presence or absence of a 64 μg/ml concentration of a wild type JIP-1-JBD (residues 148–174) synthetic peptide or a random sequence control peptide (48.Yasuda J. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sharma M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7245-7254Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Proteins bound to the GST fusion proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and analyzed by Western blot with antibodies against JNK1 or p38 (48.Yasuda J. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sharma M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7245-7254Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with either pCDNA3-FLAG-JNK1 or pCNDA3 using Fugene-6. Transient transfectants were made quiescent by serum starvation for 12 h and assayed at 36 h. Following stimulation with 10 μg/ml anisomycin and lysis, FLAG-JNK1 was immunoprecipitated with M2 antibody for 2 h at 4 °C, and immune complexes were collected on anti-mouse agarose (Sigma). FLAG-JNK1 was eluted with FLAG peptide (100 μg/ml) in kinase buffer (25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 25 mm MgCl2, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) overnight at 4 °C. IRS-1 was immunopurified from quiescent CHOIR/IRS-1 cells. Kinase assays were initiated by the addition of kinase and 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP to IRS-1 immune complexes, 1 mg of ATF2GST, or 1 mg of NH2-JunGST in a final volume of 50 μl of kinase buffer. Where indicated, kinase assays were performed in the presence of 10 μm LY294002 (Calbiochem). Reactions were terminated after 30 min at room temperature with ice-cold PBS and the addition of SDS-sample buffer. Phosphorylation of substrate proteins was examined, after SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose, by autoradiography and Cerenkov 32P counting. Metabolic labeling of CHO cells with [32P]orthophosphate was performed as described (49.Sun X.J. Crimmins D.L. Myers Jr., M.G. Miralpeix M. White M.F. Mol. Cell.

Tryptic peptides were generated from IRS-1 on nitrocellulose and resolved on a Waters HPLC system equipped with a Hi-Pore reverse phase column (Bio-Rad) as described (49.Sun X.J. Crimmins D.L.

Endoproteinase Glu-C (Promega) digestion of the initial tryptic HPLC peak was performed in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate (pH 7.8) for 24 h at 37 °C. TNFα promotes many biological responses, including the activation of the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAP kinase, which might mediate the phosphorylation of IRS-1 (38.Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar, 41.Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2046) Google Scholar). To investigate the phosphorylation of IRS-proteins by these kinases, we activated JNK and p38 in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the insulin receptor (CHOIR) and either IRS-1 or IRS-2. Anisomycin is a protein synthesis inhibitor, but at low concentrations it strongly activates JNK and p38 without inhibition of protein synthesis (52.Cano E. Hazzalin C.A. Mahadevan L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7352-7362Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 53.Zinck R. Cahill M.A. Kracht M. Sachsenmaier C. Hipskind R.A. Nordheim A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4930-4938Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). CHOIR/IRS-1 cells were treated for 30 min with anisomycin, and cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and screened with phosphospecific antibodies against c-Jun (a JNK1 substrate) and p38. Anisomycin induced the phosphorylation of each protein, confirming that JNK and p38 were activated by anisomycin in CHOIR/IRS-1 cells (Fig. 1 A). In addition, anisomycin reduced the rate of migration of IRS-1 during SDS-PAGE, and alkaline phosphatase treatment of cell lysates restored a normal rate of migration (Fig. 1 B). These results support the hypothesis that anisomycin stimulates phosphorylation of IRS-1 with kinetics similar to those observed for the activation of JNK and p38. The effect of anisomycin on insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation was investigated by immunoblotting CHOIR cell extracts expressing IRS-1 or IRS-2 with antibodies against phosphotyrosine. Before incubation with anisomycin, insulin (25 nm) strongly increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2, whereas treatment of these cells with anisomycin for 30 min before insulin stimulation inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1, Cand D). Half-maximal inhibition occurred at 1 μg/ml anisomycin; inhibition was associated with a reduced migration of IRS-1 and IRS-2 during SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1, C and D). As expected, anisomycin inhibited the association of p85 with IRS-1 during insulin stimulation (Fig. 1 E). Thus, anisomycin appears to promote serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2, which is associated with inhibition of insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation. IRS-1 contains over 70 putative serine phosphorylation sites and is extensively serine-phosphorylated in the basal state (45.Sun X.J. Miralpeix M. Myers Jr., M.G. Glasheen E.M. Backer J.M. Kahn C.R. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22662-22672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, the identification of serine phosphorylation sites that inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation is difficult. To identify the regions of IRS-1 that might be involved, various IRS-1 deletion mutants were expressed in CHOIRcells, and the effect of anisomycin on their migration during SDS-PAGE and tyrosine phosphorylation was determined (Fig.2 A). The effect of anisomycin (5 μg/ml) to reduce the migration of IRS-1 during SDS-PAGE and to inhibit insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation was retained upon deletion of the pleckstrin homology domain or deletion of residues 584–898 in the COOH terminus of IRS-1. By contrast, deletion of the PTB domain (residues 140–309) significantly reduced these effects of anisomycin (Fig. 2 B). Based on this analysis, a truncated IRS-1 protein was constructed, which contained the first 309 residues of IRS-1 (the pleckstrin homology and PTB domains) fused to residues 555–898 of the COOH-terminal tail (Fig. 2 A). This construct, called PPYIRS-1, is tyrosine-phosphorylated during insulin stimulation, binds PI 3-kinase, and mediates the expected downstream signals (54.Yenush L. Zanella C. Uchida T. Bernal D. White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6784-6794Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Importantly, anisomycin decreased the electrophoretic mobility of PPYIRS-1 and inhibited its insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation, suggesting that PPYIRS-1 contains the elements by which anisomycin inhibits IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 3). Furthermore, TNFα inhibits the insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of PPYIRS-1, but not the phosphorylation of an IRS-1 molecule deleted for the PTB domain, in 32D cells (data not shown).Figure 3PPYIRS-1 contains the elements necessary for the inhibition of insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation by anisomycin. Insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of PPYIRS-1 is inhibited by anisomycin. CHOIR/PPYIRS-1 cells were treated for 30 min with (lanes b and d) or without (lanes a and c) 5.0 μg/ml anisomycin prior to stimulation with (lanes c andd) or without (lanes a andb) insulin. Lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies against phosphotyrosine (αPY) and IRS-1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In several cases, protein phosphorylation by various MAP kinases is dependent on allosteric binding of the kinase to its substrate or an associated scaffold protein (55.Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1904) Google Scholar). Similarities between the binding motifs of several JNK substrates reveals a putative consensus binding motif defined by the sequence (R/K)XXXXLXL (Fig.4 A) (44.Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A. Xia Z. Halpern J.R. Greenberg M.E. Sawyers C.L. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 277: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 56.Yang S.H. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Sharrocks A.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1740-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the IRS-1 primary sequence contains 14 similar motifs, 11 of which are found in the COOH terminus, including two likely sites beginning at Arg852 and Arg780 (Fig. 4 A). Since PPYIRS-1 retains these putative JNK-binding domains, PPYIRS-1 was immunoprecipitated from quiescent CHOIR/PPYIRS-1 cells and analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies against JNK1. JNK1 was detected in PPYIRS-1 immunoprecipitates but not in preimmune complexes, suggesting that JNK1 associated with PPYIRS-1 in vivo (Fig. 4 B). By contrast, JNK1 did not associate with PPIRS-1, a truncated IRS-1 molecule consisting of only the pleckstrin homology and PTB domains (Fig. 4 B). Immunoblots with p38-specific antibodies revealed that PPYIRS-1 and PPIRS-1 did not associate with p38. Furthermore, an inhibitor of p38 activity (SB 230580 (58.Enslen H. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1741-1748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar)) did not block the inhibitory effect of anisomycin on insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 (data not shown). Thus, JNK but not p38, might bind to an (R/K)XXXXLXL motif between amino acids residues 555 and 898 of IRS-1 and mediate serine phosphorylation. The location of the preferred JNK binding region in IRS-1 was further verified with GST fusion proteins containing various regions of IRS-1, including residues 1–309, 140–581, 555–898, or 1064–1235; the JNK-binding domain in JNK-interacting protein (JIP)-1 was used as a positive control in these experiments, since it was shown previously to strongly bind JNK (48.Yasuda J. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sharma M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7245-7254Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). HEK 293 cell lysates were incubated with these immobilized GST fusion proteins, and the binding of JNK1 to these proteins was detected by specific immunoblotting with antibodies against JNK1. Consistent with previous reports, JNK1 strongly bound to the JIP fragment; however, JNK also associated specifically with residues 555–898 of IRS-1, whereas it failed to bind to GST or GST fusion proteins containing other regions of IRS-1 (Fig. 4 C). The binding of JNK1 was blocked by a synthetic peptide that corresponds to the JNK-binding domain of JIP-1 (Fig. 4 D). The activity of JNK associated with IRS-1 was determined in immunocomplexes prepared from cell lysates before and after anisomycin treatment (Fig. 4 E). The assays were conducted in the presence of the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 to eliminate background activities due to PI 3-kinase-dependent kinases (14.Li J. De Fea K. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9351-9356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 59.Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biochem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Google Scholar). During incubation of the αIRS-1 immunocomplexes with [32P]ATP, serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 was significantly greater in samples from anisomycin-treated cells, suggesting that JNK might be involved in IRS-1 phospho"
https://openalex.org/W2073936529,"Mdm2 has been shown to regulate p53 stability by targeting the p53 protein for proteasomal degradation. We now report that Mdm2 is a ubiquitin protein ligase (E3) for p53 and that its activity is dependent on its RING finger. Furthermore, we show that Mdm2 mediates its own ubiquitination in a RING finger-dependent manner, which requires no eukaryotic proteins other than ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) and an ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2). It is apparent, therefore, that Mdm2 manifests an intrinsic capacity to mediate ubiquitination. Mutation of putative zinc coordination residues abrogated this activity, as did chelation of divalent cations. After cation chelation, the full activity could be restored by addition of zinc. We further demonstrate that the degradation of p53 and Mdm2 in cells requires additional potential zinc-coordinating residues beyond those required for the intrinsic activity of Mdm2 in vitro. Replacement of the Mdm2 RING with that of another protein (Praja1) reconstituted ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Mdm2. However, this RING was ineffective in ubiquitination and proteasomal targeting of p53, suggesting that there may be specificity at the level of the RING in the recognition of heterologous substrates.

Binding of p53 through this region also conceals the trans-activation domain of p53 and, therefore, inhibits its transcriptional activity (6.Kubbutat M.H. Vousden K.H. Mol. Med.

Recent studies also indicate that nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of Mdm2 plays a significant role in p53 degradation (15.Roth J. Dobbelstein M. Freedman D.A. Shenk T. Levine A.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 554-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 16.Tao W. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3077-3080Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 17.Tao W.

Cell Res. 1999; 248: 457-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Mutation of the nuclear export signal of Mdm2 abrogates its ability to target p53 for degradation, raising the possibility that the shuttling of p53 by Mdm2 from nucleus to cytoplasm is required for p53 to be subject to proteasome-mediated degradation (15.Roth J. Dobbelstein M. Freedman D.A. Shenk T. Levine A.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 554-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 17.Tao W. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6937-6941Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). This is supported by a recent finding that ARF sequesters Mdm2, but not p53, into nucleoli and blocks export of Mdm2 from the nucleus to cytoplasm (17.Tao W. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6937-6941Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 19.Weber J.D. Taylor L.J. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Bar-Sagi D. Nat.

Other Mdm2-associated proteins also affect Mdm2-mediated p53 degradation; the interaction of p300 with Mdm2 promotes p53 degradation (26.Grossman S.R. Perez M. Kung A.L. Joseph M. Mansur C. Xiao Z.X. Kumar S. Howley P.M. Livingston D.M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 405-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), whereas the interaction of Mdm2 with pRB and c-Abl stabilizes p53 in cells (27.Hsieh J.K. Chan F.S.

Ben-Neriah Y. Oren M. Haupt Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8371-8374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). It is becoming clear that Mdm2-mediated degradation of p53 is proteasome-dependent (7.Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2860) Google Scholar, 8.Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3750) Google Scholar). Recent studies have suggested that Mdm2 has the capacity to function as a ubiquitin (Ub)1 protein ligase (E3) both for itself and for p53 in vitro (29.Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar, 30.Honda R. Yasuda H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). E3s provide specificity to Ub conjugation and are the final components in the multienzyme process that eventually leads to the covalent modification of proteins with Ub (31.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6959) Google Scholar). The first step in Ub conjugation involves the ATP-dependent activation of Ub by a Ub-activating enzyme (E1), where a transient thiol ester linkage is formed with the C terminus of Ub. The activated Ub is then transferred to an active site cysteine of a Ub-conjugating enzyme (Ubc or E2). The final step requires an E3 that catalyzes the formation of an isopeptide linkage between the C terminus of Ub and ε-amino group of a lysine on a substrate (31.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6959) Google Scholar). In some cases, such as the HECT (homologous to E6-AP Cterminus) family E3s (32.Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar), a thiol ester intermediate between Ub and the E3 is formed (31.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6959) Google Scholar). In other instances it is believed that the E3 binds the E2-Ub complex and mediates the direct transfer of Ub from E2 to substrates (31.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6959) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that Mdm2 is an E3 and that it functions both in ubiquitination of p53 and itself. The E3 activity of Mdm2 is dependent on its RING finger domain. Unlike the binding of the RING finger domain to RNA (33.Lai Z. Freedman D.A. Levine A.J. McLendon G.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7005-7015Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), coordination of zinc by the RING finger is required for E3 activity of Mdm2. Furthermore, by substitution of the RING finger from a heterologous protein, we demonstrate that another RING finger can substitute for that of Mdm2 for mediating its own ubiquitination in vitro and proteasomal targeting in cells. Antibodies to Mdm2 (SMP14, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Mdm2 (Ab-1, Oncogene Science), p53 (Ab-1 and Ab-6, Oncogene Science), FLAG (IBI), and GFP (CLONTECH) were used for immunoprecipitation and/or Western blotting. Plasmids encoding wild type Mdm2 (pCHDM) and its mutant (pCHDM C464A), wild type p53 with N-terminal FLAG tag (pcDNA3-FLAG-p53) have been described (34.Kubbutat M.H. Ludwig R.L. Levine A.J. Vousden K.H. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 87-92PubMed Google Scholar). pCHDM mutants, C305S, C438L, C449S, H452A, T455A, and C478S, were generated by site-directed mutagenesis, and pCHDM was used as template. pGEX4T1-Mdm2 (human wild type) was generated by subcloning Mdm2 cDNA into the EcoRI site of pGEX4T1. pGEX4T1-Mdm2 mutants, C305S, C373T, C438L, C441S, R444T, C449S, H452A, T455A, H457A, C461S, C475G, and C478S, were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using pGEX4T1-Mdm2 as template. To construct pGEX4T1-Mdm2PR, the RING finger domain was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using pGEX-Praja1 cDNA (mouse) (35.Mishra L. Tully R.E. Monga S.P., Yu, P. Cai T. Makalowski W. Mezey E. Pavan W.J. Mishra B. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2361-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) as template (5′ primer, ATAGAACTAGTTCCTGAGATCCTGGTCACCG; 3′ primer, GCAGATCGTCAGTCAGTCAC). The RING finger of Mdm2 was removed from pGEX4T1-Mdm2 C438L using SpeI and NotI double digestion and that of Praja1 was subcloned in using the same sites. TheSpeI site was created during generation of the pGEX4T1-Mdm2 C438L mutant. pCIneo-Mdm2 and pCIneo-Mdm2 H452A were generated by subcloning the relevant cDNAs into the EcoRI site of pCIneo. pCIneo-Mdm2PR and pCIneo-Mdm2PR(H->S)(Praja1 RING finger mutant) were generated by subcloning the relevant cDNA into EcoRI and NotI sites of the pCIneo vector. pEGFP was purchased from CLONTECH. All mutations were created using the Quick Change site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Restriction sites were created in the mutation sites to facilitate screening by restriction digestion. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing. Oligonucleotide sequences used for mutagenesis are available upon request. COS cells and U2OS osteosarcoma cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were transfected using calcium phosphate precipitation. As previously reported (34.Kubbutat M.H. Ludwig R.L. Levine A.J. Vousden K.H. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 87-92PubMed Google Scholar), for examination of the degradation of p53 by Mdm2 and its mutants, U2OS cells were co-transfected with 3 μg of Mdm2 or its mutant-encoding plasmids (pCHDM, pCHDM mutants, pCIneoMdm2, pCIneo-Mdm2 mutants, and pCIneo-Mdm2PR), 9 μg of pcDNA3FLAG-p53, and 1 μg of pEGFP. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. The total cell lysates were used for immunoblotting using an ECL detection kit as described (34.Kubbutat M.H. Ludwig R.L. Levine A.J. Vousden K.H. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 87-92PubMed Google Scholar). GlutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusions of Mdm2 and its mutant were expressed in log phase Escherichia coli BL-21 (DE3) (Novagen, Madison, WI) that had been grown overnight at room temperature (RT) and induced with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 1 h, also at RT. Bacterial pellets were resuspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm DTT, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (sonication buffer) and lysed by probe sonication, using 4 ml of sonication buffer per 100 ml of bacterial culture. The sonicate was clarified by centrifugation at 4 °C for 15 min at 18,000 × g, aliquoted, and stored at −70 °C. Levels of expressed GST fusion proteins were estimated by incubating sonicates with glutathione-Sepharose beads (GS), washing, and quantification by SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Known amounts of bovine serum albumin were used as standards. Preparation of wheat E1 and UbcH5B have been previously reported (36.Jensen J.P. Bates P.W. Yang M. Vierstra R.D. Weissman A.M. J. Biol.

After immobilized on GS, the GST-Ub was labeled with 32P as described (38.Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8797-8801Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), followed by cleavage of the GST portion using thrombin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Thrombin was depleted using benzamidine-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Recombinant mouse E1 in a baculovirus vector containing a His tag was a gift of Kazuhiro Iwai. Recombinant virus was added at a multiplicity of infection of 5 and allowed to infect the cells for 2 h at room temperature with occasional rocking. The viral stock was removed and replaced with supplemented Grace's medium (Invitrogen) for 2 days at 27 °C. Cells were harvested and centrifuged at low speed for 10 min. The cell pellet was lysed with 1 ml of lysis buffer (100 mmTris, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmDTT, 10% glycerol) per 8 × 106 cells (∼1.5 ml buffer per flask). Lysate was clarified by centrifugation and stored at −70 °C. Mouse E1 was purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen), using the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. Briefly, 1 ml of clarified extract containing 8 mmimidazole was bound to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with buffer containing 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole. The His-tagged mouse E1 was eluted in elution buffer (50 mmNaH2PO4, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole). The eluate was dialyzed against 50 mm NaH2PO4, 2 mm DTT overnight at 4 °C using Pierce Slidealyzer dialysis cassettes with a molecular weight cut-off of 10 kDa that had been soaked in 0.5% bovine serum albumin before use. Final dialyzed eluate was evaluated by Coomassie Blue staining and by its ability to catalyze ubiquitination. GST-Mdm2 (500 ng) was immobilized on GS. Ubiquitination assays were carried out by adding 20 ng each of bacterially expressed wheat E1, UbcH5B, and 2 × 104 cpm of 32P-labeled Ub in ubiquitination buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, and 2 μl of bacterial cell lysate from BL-21 cells transformed with “empty” pET15B. Reactions were in 30 μl and were carried out for 1.5 h at 30 °C with agitation in an Eppendorf Thermomixer. Following the ubiquitination reaction, the samples were heated to 95 °C in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol prior to resolution on 7.5% SDS-PAGE. Ubiquitinated products were revealed by exposure to Phosphor screens and analyzed using a Storm PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Applied Biosystems). For p53 ubiquitination assays, confluent COS cells were treated with MG132, 30 μm, overnight, to accumulate endogenous p53. The cells were then lysed using Triton X-100 lysis buffer. The lysate was centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected and stored at −70 °C. 200 μl of 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, and 30–50 μl of COS cell lysate were added to GS-immobilized GST-Mdm2. The mixture was tumbled for 2 h at 4 °C to form GST-Mdm2·p53 complex. Following extensive washing with 50 mm Tris buffer, the GST-Mdm2·p53 complex was used for ubiquitination assay that was carried out in ubiquitination buffer containing mouse E1 (200 ng), UbcH5B (150 ng), Ub (10 μg) in a total volume of 30 μl. The reaction proceeded at 30 °C for 1.5 h in an Eppendorf Thermomixer at 800 rpm to keep the beads in suspension. Following the reaction, the samples were processed for SDS-PAGE and Western blot for p53. A similar ubiquitination assay was carried out using [35S]methionine-labeled p53. The latter was generated byin vitro transcription and translation in reticulocyte lysate using a T7-driven coupled TnT Kit (Promega). 2 × 104 cpm of in vitro translated p53 were added to GST-Mdm2 in the presence of ubiquitination components as described above. The entire reaction mix was resolved on 7.5% SDS-PAGE and analyzed using a Storm PhosphorImager. For cation chelation, GST-Mdm2 was immobilized on GS and was incubated with 2 mm N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)-ethylenediamine (TPEN) (39.Shumaker D.K. Vann L.R. Goldberg M.W. Allen T.D. Wilson K.L. Cell Calcium. 1998; 23: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) or 0.5% ethanol (vehicle) in Tris, 50 mm, pH 7.5, overnight at 4 °C. After extensive washing, the immobilized GST-Mdm2 was treated with indicated amounts of ZnCl2 for 45 min at RT. After washing, samples were used for ubiquitination assays. For alkylation experiments, GS-bound GST-Mdm2 and GST-Nedd4 were treated with the indicated concentration of N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) (Fluka, Ronkonkoma, NY) in PBS for 30 min at room temperature on a rotator. Negative controls were treated with PBS only. NEM was removed by two washes in 10 mm DTT/PBS, followed by 3 washes in PBS alone. A GST fusion of Mdm2 was expressed in E. coli and assessed for its capacity to catalyze ubiquitination in vitro. GST-Mdm2 was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (GS) followed by a ubiquitination reaction using recombinant 32P-labeled Ub in the presence of E1 and E2 (UbcH5B), both of which were also expressed as recombinant proteins in E. coli. As is evident (Fig.1 A), GST-Mdm2 mediated ubiquitination that was dependent on E1 and E2. Although all of the proteins present in the bacterial cell lysate are potential ubiquitination substrates, at least 90% of the high molecular weight species detected in this reaction represent ubiquitination of GS-immobilized GST-Mdm2 itself (data not shown). These findings are consistent with a previous report that Mdm2 expressed in eukaryotic cells is able to mediate its own ubiquitination in vitro(30.Honda R. Yasuda H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar) and demonstrate that this activity is not dependent on other proteins that might co-purify with Mdm2 when expressed in eukaryotic cells. Rather these findings establish that the capacity to mediate E2-dependent ubiquitination is intrinsic to Mdm2. The activity of the recombinant GST-Mdm2 fusion protein toward p53 was evaluated in an in vitro p53 ubiquitination assay using p53 derived from cells. In this assay p53 was bound to GST-Mdm2 and assessed for ubiquitination followed by resolution on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-p53. Higher molecular weight species indicative of addition of multiple Ub moieties were seen only in the presence of added E1 and E2 (Fig. 1 B) and Ub. A similar result was obtained using 35S-labeled p53 generated byin vitro translation, with a smear of ubiquitinated p53 extending to the top of the gel (Fig. 1 C). The initial description of Mdm2 as an E3 suggested that the activity of this protein is dependent on a HECT-like domain within the C-terminal region with evidence of a thiol ester linkage of Ub with Mdm2 (29.Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar). Cysteine 464 (Cys-464) was suggested to be the active cysteine analogous to that in HECT E3s, such as E6-AP and Nedd4 (29.Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar,32.Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). However, the cysteine-rich C-terminal region, including Cys-464, of Mdm2 has also been shown to be a RING finger and to coordinate zinc (33.Lai Z. Freedman D.A. Levine A.J. McLendon G.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7005-7015Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 40.Boddy M.N. Freemont P.S. Borden K.L. Trends Biochem.

To begin to evaluate these alternative possibilities, we tested the sensitivity of Mdm2 to the alkylating agent N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). As is evident, when exposed to concentrations of this reagent as low as 0.1 mm, the activity of a HECT E3 (Nedd4) was largely abrogated (85%), whereas the activity of Mdm2 was not significantly affected (Fig. 2 B). However, at higher concentrations of NEM, some diminution in activity was also evident for Mdm2, possibly due to alkylation of cysteines within the RING finger that participate in zinc coordination. Nevertheless, this result is consistent with observations that ubiquitination mediated by RING finger proteins is relatively insensitive to alkylating agents (45.Seol J.H. Feldman R.M. Zachariae W. Shevchenko A. Correll C.C. Lyapina S. Chi Y. Galova M. Claypool J. Sandmeyer S. Nasmyth K. Deshaies R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1614-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). 2J. P. Jensen and A. M. Weissman, unpublished observations. Further differentiation between HECT and RING-mediated ubiquitination took advantage of the fact that HECT domain E3s do not require divalent cations for their activity, whereas RING finger proteins require zinc (37.Lorick K.L. Jensen J.P. Fang S. Ong A.M. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11364-11369Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 C, treatment of GST-Mdm2 with the potent metal chelator, TPEN (39.Shumaker D.K. Vann L.R. Goldberg M.W. Allen T.D. Wilson K.L. Cell Calcium. 1998; 23: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), led to a total loss of Mdm2 ubiquitination. The ubiquitination of Mdm2 was readily restored by addition of ZnCl2. Similarly, the capacity to catalyze p53 ubiquitination in vitro was also abrogated by TPEN and restored by ZnCl2 (Fig. 2 D). To rule out the possibility that the requirement for zinc reflected a need for the zinc finger of Mdm2, a zinc-coordinating cysteine (Cys-305) within the zinc finger was mutated to serine. The mutant retained the capacity to catalyze E2-dependent ubiquitination of p53 (Fig.2 E). Thus, an intact zinc finger is not required for p53 ubiquitination by Mdm2 in vitro. These results suggest that a zinc-coordinated RING finger likely provides the basis for the E3 activity of Mdm2. RING finger domains are conserved cysteine-rich amino acid sequences that form two interleaved zinc-binding sites with a total of eight cysteines and histidines constituting the sites of metal coordination (48.Borden K.L. Freemont P.S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 49.Saurin A.J. Borden K.L. Boddy M.N. Freemont P.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 208-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar) (Fig.3 A). RING fingers are classified as RING-HC or RING-H2 depending on whether they have a cysteine or a histidine in the fifth coordination site. Based on the crystal structure of the RING-HC finger of promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) (50.Borden K.L. Boddy M.N. Lally J. O'Reilly N.J. Martin S. Howe K. Solomon E. Freemont P.S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1532-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), cysteines or histidines in the first, second, fifth, and sixth positions coordinate one zinc ion (Site 1) and those in the third, fourth, seventh, and eighth positions coordinate the second (Site 2) (Fig. 3 A). The data presented in Fig. 2indicate that chelation of zinc from the Mdm2 RING finger results in loss of E3 activity. Thus, we would predict that mutation of zinc coordination sites in the RING finger would similarly abrogate E3 activity. Because the Mdm2 RING does not fit within RING finger consensus sequences, particularly with regard to spacing between the third and fourth coordination residues, it has been speculated that a threonine (Thr-455) rather than a cysteine together with His-457 might constitute the third and fourth zinc-coordinating residues, respectively (40.Boddy M.N. Freemont P.S. Borden K.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 198-199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 B). However, based on metal binding studies in which Cys-449 and His-452 were simultaneously mutated, it has been suggested that Cys-449 and His-452 instead represent the third and fourth residues (33.Lai Z. Freedman D.A. Levine A.J. McLendon G.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7005-7015Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 B). We there"
https://openalex.org/W1992967227,"Here we describe a small family of proteins, termed MCIP1 and MCIP2 (for myocyte-enrichedcalcineurin interacting protein), that are expressed most abundantly in striated muscles and that form a physical complex with calcineurin A. MCIP1 is encoded by<i>DSCR1</i>, a gene located in the Down syndrome critical region. Expression of the MCIP family of proteins is up-regulated during muscle differentiation, and their forced overexpression inhibits calcineurin signaling to a muscle-specific target gene in a myocyte cell background. Binding of MCIP1 to calcineurin A requires sequence motifs that resemble calcineurin interacting domains found in NFAT proteins. The inhibitory action of MCIP1 involves a direct association with the catalytic domain of calcineurin, rather than interference with the function of downstream components of the calcineurin signaling pathway. The interaction between MCIP proteins and calcineurin may modulate calcineurin-dependent pathways that control hypertrophic growth and selective programs of gene expression in striated muscles."
https://openalex.org/W2058015944,"We previously showed that oncoprotein MDM2 has ubiquitin ligase activity toward tumor suppressor p53. In that paper, we showed very weak homology in the carboxyl terminal portion between MDM2 and E6AP (HECT domain). We mutated the cysteine residue (C464) corresponding to the residue essential for the ubiquitin ligase activity of E6AP and this mutation diminished the ligase activity of MDM2. The cysteine residue described above is also one of the cysteine residues that form the RING finger domain of MDM2. We tried to find out whether the diminishing of the activity by the mutation is attributable to the disruption of the RING finger domain or not. When the ring finger domain of MDM2 was deleted, the truncation mutant did not have the ubiquitin ligase activity. When we mutated the seven cysteine residues of RING finger domain of MDM2 in the carboxyl terminus, the disruption of each residue in the RING finger completely diminished the ubiquitin ligase activity of MDM2 toward MDM2 itself and toward tumor suppressor p53. These data indicate that the RING finger domain in MDM2 is essential for its ubiquitin ligase activity toward p53 and itself."

We proposed that TGFα and the autocrine activation of its receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), leads to phosphorylation and activation of c-Met. We found that there is constitutive c-Met phosphorylation in human hepatoma cell lines and the human epidermoid carcinoma cell line, A431 which express TGFα, but not in normal human hepatocytes. Constitutive c-Met phosphorylation in A431, HepG2, AKN-1, and HuH6 cells was inhibited by neutralizing antibodies against TGFα and/or EGFR. Exposure to exogenous TGFα or EGF increased the phosphorylation of c-Met in the human epidermoid carcinoma cell line, A431. The increase of c-Met phosphorylation by TGFα in A431 cells was inhibited by neutralizing antibodies against TGFα and/or EGFR and by the EGFR-specific inhibitor tyrphostin AG1478. These results indicate that constitutive c-Met phosphorylation, and the increase of c-Met phosphorylation by TGFα or EGF, in tumor cell lines is the result of the activation via EGFR. We found that c-Met in tumor cells co-immunoprecipitates with EGFR regardless of the existence of their ligands in tumor cells, but not in normal human hepatocytes. We conclude that c-Met associates with EGFR in tumor cells, and this association facilitates the phosphorylation of c-Met in the absence of hepatocyte growth factor.

Both TGFα and EGF bind and activate the same receptor, EGFR, and thus induce a mitogenic and motogenic response in many cell types. EGFR is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase which is encoded by the proto-oncogene c-erb B and is expressed on most cell types. The activated EGFR dimerizes and autophosphorylates tyrosine residues and leads to a cascade of intracellular signaling pathways including the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI-3K) pathway, Ras-Raf-MAPK pathway, and phospholipase C pathway (8.van der Geer P. Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). Scatter factor/hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) was originally described as a mitogenic factor of hepatocytes during liver regeneration (9.Zarnegar R. Michalopoulos G.

We proposed that EGFR constitutively activated by autocrine TGFα expression results in cross-talk between these growth factor receptor systems resulting in constitutive phosphorylation of c-Met. Cross-talk between the TGFα/EGFR pathway and the HGF/c-Met pathway might induce mitogenic or motogenic signal amplification and may help explain how overexpression of TGFα alters cell growth or contributes to transformation.

Cells which were plated on collagen-coated 100-mm plates were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline twice. Cell lysates were prepared using RIPA buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 0.5% deoxycholate sodium, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/ml; sodium vanadate, 0.4 mm; pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml; leupeptin, 1 μg/ml) and kept on ice for 30 min, and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 20 min. Quantitation of protein was performed using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Sigma). Cell lysates were precleared with normal serum and either Protein A or G depending on the antibodies used. After centrifugation, supernatant was incubated with primary antibody for 2 h at room temperature and with 10% Protein A or G for another hour. The pellet was washed three times with RIPA buffer containing proteinase inhibitors. For Western blot, immunoprecipitates or total cell lysates were resolved by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Blotto solution (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C and then were incubated with primary antibody for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were washed three times for 10 min each with 1% nonfat dry milk in Blotto solution, and were incubated with secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was washed four times for 20 min each with Blotto base. The signal was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection and overexpression of TGFα leads to constitutive phosphorylation of both EGFR and c-Met (23.Presnell S.C. Stolz D.B. Mars W.M. Jo M. Michalopoulos G.K. Strom S.C. Mol. Carcinog. 1997; 18: 244-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), but it is not known if non-manipulated tumor cells which overexpress TGFα also share this property. It is known that many tumor cells overexpress TGFα, so we examined the phosphorylation state of EGFR and c-Met in various tumor cell lines including human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) such as HepG2, AKN-1, and HuH6 and human epidermoid carcinoma cell line, A431 as well as in normal human hepatocytes. In addition to constitutive phosphorylation of EGFR in three human hepatoma cell lines (Fig. 1 B), c-Met also displayed constitutive phosphorylation in the absence of its ligand (Fig. 1 A, control lane). The human epidermoid carcinoma cell line, A431, expresses high levels of EGFR due to and amplification of the gene (27.Merlino G.T. Xu Y.H. Ishii S. Clark A.J. Semba K. Toyoshima K. Yamamoto T.

As with the HCC, there was constitutive phosphorylation of EGFR and c-Met (Fig. 1, A and C, control lanes) in A431 cells. By comparison, there was little phosphorylation of EGFR and no phosphorylation of c-Met in primarily isolated normal human hepatocytes (Fig. 1, A, control lane, and B). The constitutive expression of TGFα in the HCC was confirmed by RT-PCR (Fig. 2 A). None of the HCC and A431 expressed message for HGF, thus the constitutive c-Met phosphorylation in these cell lines is not due to HGF expression by those cells (Fig. 2, A and B). The faint expression of HGF message in human hepatocytes (Fig. 2 A) was most likely due to the contamination of the parenchymal cell fraction with stellate cells which are known to express HGF. In liver regeneration, TGFα is expressed in an autocrine manner after partial hepatectomy, and hepatocytes also express TGFα when their proliferation is stimulated by addition of EGF or TGFα. However, there is very low level of TGFα expression in normal liver and non-replicating hepatocytes (31.Michalopoulos G.K. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 176-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar, 32.Fausto N. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1991; 3: 219-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). There was TGFα expression in some cases of normal human hepatocytes (Fig. 2 A) which may be responsible for the low level of constitutive EGFR phosphorylation.Figure 2A, expression of TGFα and HGF in HCC cell lines by RT-PCR and Southern blot analysis.

Cells were incubated with 50 ng/ml TGFα, EGF, or HGF for 15 min and cells were harvested to analyze c-Met phosphorylation. Addition of TGFα or EGF did not increase the existing c-Met phosphorylation in any of the human hepatoma cell lines or human hepatocytes (Fig. 1 A). However, we expected that c-Met phosphorylation would be increased when A431 cells are incubated with exogenous TGFα or EGF because A431 cells overexpress EGFR in contrast to hepatoma cell lines which have a limited number of EGFR. When A431 cells were incubated with TGFα or EGF for 15 min, phosphorylation of c-Met was increased significantly (Fig. 1 A). Cross-talk between EGFR and c-Met in A431 cells proceeds in a unidirectional manner, as incubation of the cells to exogenous HGF did not result in an increase of phosphorylation of EGFR (Fig. 1 C). Next, we examined how the inhibition of EGFR activity affects constitutive c-Met phosphorylation. If constitutive c-Met phosphorylation depends on EGFR activity in these tumor cells, inhibition of EGFR activity should also decrease c-Met phosphorylation. We incubated A431, HepG2, and AKN-1 cells with neutralizing antibodies against TGFα and EGFR. The incubation of neutralizing antibodies against TGFα or EGFR for 12 h inhibited significantly the constitutive c-Met phosphorylation in HepG2, AKN-1, and A431 cells and the incubation of two antibodies together inhibited c-Met phosphorylation more effectively (Fig. 3). The incubation with neutralizing antibody against TGFα did not inhibit constitutive c-Met phosphorylation, however, neutralizing antibody against EGFR significantly inhibited the constitutive c-Met phosphorylation in HepG2 cells. HuH6 cells also showed the same results (data not shown). Neutralizing antibodies to TGFα and/or EGFR did not inhibit c-Met phosphorylation due to the addition of exogenous HGF in those cell lines. Incubation of cells with nonspecific antibodies, goat IgG, and/or mouse IgG had no effect on c-Met phosphorylation (data not shown). These results confirm that constitutive phosphorylation of c-Met is dependent upon TGFα/EGFR in HCC and A431 cells. We wished to determine whether the increase of c-Met phosphorylation by incubation with TGFα or EGF in A431 cells is a result of the activation of the TGFα/EGFR pathway. Cells were incubated with neutralizing antibodies against TGFα, EGFR, or the two together for 12 h, and cells were treated with 50 ng/ml TGFα or HGF for 15 min. The incubation of neutralizing antibodies inhibited c-Met phosphorylation by TGFα significantly, and the incubation of two antibodies together inhibited c-Met phosphorylation more effectively (Fig.4 A). A431 cells were incubated with various concentrations of the EGFR-specific inhibitor tyrphostin AG1478 for 2 h before treatment with 50 ng/ml TGFα or HGF. Concentrations from 20 to 200 nm of AG1478 decreased c-Met phosphorylation by exogenous TGFα significantly, while the inhibitor did not affect c-Met phosphorylation by HGF at any concentration used (Fig. 4 B). These results indicate that TGFα or EGF increased c-Met phosphorylation through the activation of their receptor, EGFR. EGFR is known to phosphorylate the receptor of its subfamily member p185 neu through heterodimerization (33.Wada T. Qian X.L. Greene M.I. Cell. 1990; 61: 1339-1347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). A recent study showed that EGFR can also heterodimerize and phosphorylate a different receptor family member, PDGFβR (34.Habib A.A. Hognason T. Ren J. Stefansson K. Ratan R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6885-6891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Constitutive phosphorylation of c-Met and the increase of c-Met phosphorylation by exogenous TGFα or EGF in A431 cells suggests heterodimeric association between the two different receptors. To determine whether this is so, cell lysates from A431 and normal human hepatocytes were immunoprecipitated with EGFR and immunoblotted with c-Met (Fig.5 A). In A431 cells, EGFR was co-precipitated with c-Met regardless of the exposure to the respective ligands, whereas EGFR and c-Met did not co-precipitate in normal human hepatocytes (Fig. 5 B). In the reverse experiment, which cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with c-Met and immunoblotted with EGFR, and the same results were obtained (Fig. 5, A andB). Since A431 cells express high levels of EGFR, it is possible that co-immunoprecipitation between these receptors might be nonspecific. To exclude this possibility, we examined the co-precipitation between c-Met and insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 and -2 in A431 cells, and we did not find co-precipitation of these proteins (data not shown). There are many recent reports that activation of specific cell surface receptors affect the activity of other non-related cell surface receptors. EGF stimulates phosphorylation of one of the EGFR family members, p185 neu, through heterodimerization of EGFR and p185 neu ; however, EGF does not bind to p185 neu (33.Wada T. Qian X.L. Greene M.I. Cell. 1990; 61: 1339-1347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 35.Stern D.F. Kamps M.P. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 995-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar,36.Connelly P.A. Stern D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6054-6057Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). EGF also induces phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in ErbB3 and leads to recruitment of PI-3K to Erb3 in A431 cells and breast cancer cells (37.Soltoff S.P. Carraway 3rd, K.L. Prigent S.A. Gullick W.G. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3550-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 38.Kim H.H. Sierke S.L. Koland J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24747-24755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). EGFR is phosphorylated by endothelin-1, lysophosphatic acid, and thrombin, which have G-protein-coupled receptors, and might explain how G-protein-coupled receptors activate the MAPK pathway (39.Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). Yamauchi et al. (40.Yamauchi T. Ueki K. Tobe K. Tamemoto H. Sekine N. Wada M. Honjo M. Takahashi M. Takahashi T. Hirai H. Tushima T. Akanuma Y. Fujita T. Komuro I. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. Nature. 1997; 390: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) reported that EGFR was phosphorylated by growth hormone via Jak3, and phosphorylated EGFR activates Grb2 which in turn, activates MAP kinase, independently of the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of EGFR. A recent study showed that EGF phosphorylated PDGFβR through heterodimerization of EGFR and PDGFβR, resulting in the recruitment of PI-3K to the PDGFβR (34.Habib A.A. Hognason T. Ren J. Stefansson K. Ratan R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6885-6891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Angiotensin II is important in the cardiovascular and neuroendocrine system and is a growth factor for heart and vascular smooth muscle. Angiotensin II, whose receptor (AT1) is a G-protein-coupled receptor, phosphorylates the insulin receptor substrates, IRS-1 and IRS-2. This involves Jak2 tyrosine kinase which is associated with AT1 and IRS-1 and IRS-2 after the addition of angiotensin II in rat heart cells. Angiotensin II-induced phosphorylation led to an inhibition of PI-3K activity which is activated by insulin (41.Velloso L.A. Folli F. Sun X.J. White M.F. Saad M.J. Kahn C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12490-12495Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Thus, there is ample evidence that cross talk can occur between different growth factor receptors. In this study, we found that c-Met is phosphorylated by TGFα/EGFR directly or indirectly in several epithelial derived tumor cell lines. In a previous study, we reported that c-Met was phosphorylated in the absence of its ligand in TGFα-transfected rat liver epithelial cells and tumor clones (23.Presnell S.C. Stolz D.B. Mars W.M. Jo M. Michalopoulos G.K. Strom S.C. Mol. Carcinog. 1997; 18: 244-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the tumor cell lines that autocrinly express TGFα, we have examined human hepatoma cell lines HepG2, AKN-1, HuH6, and human epidermoid carcinoma cell line, A431. All of them express TGFα in an autocrine manner and display constitutive phosphorylation of EGFR and c-Met. We proposed that EGFR activated by autocrine TGFα causes phosphorylation of c-Met in these cell lines. Even though cross-talk between c-Met and EGFR occurred in all the transformed cell lines examined, exogenous TGFα or EGF failed to increase c-Met phosphorylation in HCC cell lines. This might be due to the very low numbers of EGFR in these human hepatoma cell lines, possibly caused by receptor internalization and down-regulation caused by constitutive TGFα expression. Exogenous TGFα or EGF increased c-Met phosphorylation in A431 cells, but exogenous HGF does not affect the phosphorylation of EGFR. Thus, this cross-talk between these two receptor systems appears to be unidirectional, with TGFα/EGFR phosphorylating c-Met, not vice versa. The reason that there is increase of c-Met phosphorylation by exogenous TGFα or EGF in A431 cells, but not in HCC cell lines, is likely due to the number of EGFR. Unlike the hepatoma cell lines examined, A431 cells continue to overexpress EGFR even in the presence of TGFα (27.Merlino G.T. Xu Y.H. Ishii S. Clark A.J. Semba K. Toyoshima K. Yamamoto T. Pastan I. Science. 1984; 224: 417-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 29.Van de Vijver M.J. Kumar R. Mendelsohn J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7503-7508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Kumar R. Mendelsohn J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4578-4582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The constitutive c-Met phosphorylation in HepG2, AKN-1, HuH6, and A431 cells was decreased when the activity of TGFα and its receptor was inhibited by neutralizing antibodies against TGFα and EGFR. The increase of c-Met phosphorylation by TGFα or EGF in A431 cells was also decreased when the activity of TGFα and its receptor was inhibited by neutralizing antibodies against TGFα and EGFR, or by the EGFR-specific inhibitor tyrphostin AG1478. These results indicate that constitutive c-Met phosphorylation, or the increase of c-Met phosphorylation by TGFα or EGFR, in tumor cell lines such as HCCs and A431 cells is indeed the result of the activation of TGFα/EGFR. Due to the difficulty of observing constitutive c-Met phosphorylation when cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-c-Met and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine, immunoprecipitations were done with anti-phosphotyrosine and blotted with anti-c-Met antibody. However, c-Met phosphorylation was readily shown using immunoprecipitation with anti-phosphotyrosine, even though a large amount of protein (5 mg) had to be used. This suggests that only a very small fraction of c-Met is phosphorylated by TGFα in these tumor cells. Nonetheless, there was constitutive c-Met phosphorylation of c-Met which is not caused by its ligand, HGF. We found that c-Met in A431 cells is associated with EGFR regardless of the presence of their ligands in tumor cells, but not in normal cells. This suggests that c-Met associates with EGFR either directly, or via adapter molecules, before or during tumorigenesis, and this association between receptors may enable TGFα or EGF to phosphorylate c-Met through EGFR. Cross-talk between c-Met and EGFR may have significant implications for tumorigenesis. In tumor cells, autocrine expression of TGFα may turn on the activation of c-Met as well as its receptor, EGFR, and the activation of these two different signal pathways by one ligand may amplify the signal of proliferation. TGFα may also amplify the mitogenic signal of EGFR and c-Met to promote metastasis. In HepG2, exogenous growth factors such as TGFα, EGF, or HGF do not promote mitogenesis, but instead promote motogenesis, while, in non-transformed cells, like rat hepatocytes, all three growth factors enhance both mitogenesis and motogenesis (42.Stolz D.B. Michalopoulos G.K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 170: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Perhaps, cross-talk between EGFR and c-Met promotes motogenic signaling. Co-expression of HGF and its receptor has been reported to be involved in metastasis of cancer (20.Presnell S.C. Hooth M.J. Borchert K.M. Coleman W.B. Grisham J.W. Smith G.J. Hepatology. 1998; 28: 1253-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We are currently investigating the biochemical nature and role of the cross-talk between TGFα/EGFR and HGF/c-Met pathway in tumor cell lines. We thank Maura K.

We have previously demonstrated that the SBMA gene product, the androgen receptor protein, is toxic and aggregates when truncated. Heat shock proteins function as molecular chaperones, which recognize and renaturate misfolded protein (aggregate). We thus assessed the effect of a variety of chaperones in a cultured neuronal cell model of SBMA. Overexpression of chaperones reduces aggregate formation and suppresses apoptosis in a cultured neuronal cell model of SBMA to differing degrees depending on the chaperones and their combinations. Combination of Hsp70 and Hsp40 was the most effective among the chaperones in reducing aggregate formation and providing cellular protection, reflecting that Hsp70 and Hsp40 act together in chaperoning mutant and disabled proteins. Although Hdj2/Hsdj chaperone has been previously reported to suppress expanded polyglutamine tract-formed aggregate, Hsdj/Hdj2 showed little effect in our system. These findings indicate that chaperones may be one of the key factors in the developing of CAG repeat disease and suggested that increasing expression level or enhancing the function of chaperones will provide an avenue for the treatment of CAG repeat disease.

In addition to cellular toxicity, truncated proteins with the expanded polyglutamine tracts have been shown to form aggregates, likely through hydrogen bonding or transglutaminase activity (25.Perutz M.F.

In SBMA, nuclear inclusions containing AR protein have been mainly observed in the regions of SBMA central nervous system susceptible to degeneration, including the brain stem motor nuclei and spinal motor neurons (33.Li M.

The finding that nuclear inclusions are ubiquitinated raises the possibility that alterations in the major intracellular system for degrading proteins, the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, may be involved in the pathogenesis of CAG repeat diseases. The proteasome is a large multicatalytic protease complex that is critical for many cellular processes including cell cycle control, differentiation, antigen presentation, and cell survival (35.Ciechanover A. Cell. 1997; 91: 249-254Google Scholar). Perturbations in proteasome function are associated with altered expression levels of stress response or heat shock proteins (36.Bukau K.T. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2435) Google Scholar). These proteins function as molecular chaperones, which recognize and renaturate misfolded proteins under normal and stressed conditions. In addition, chaperones may maintain proteins in an appropriate conformation (37.Hendricks J.P. Hartl F.U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 349-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar). Recently, overexpression of Hdj-2/Hsdj has been reported to decrease aggregate formation by expanded polyglutamine tract (38.Cummings C.J. Mancini M.A. Antalffy B. DeFranco D.B. Orr H.T. Zoghbi H.Y.

It has been postulated that the Hsp70 and the Hsp40 chaperone family members act together to promote cellular protein folding and renaturate misfolded protein (40.Minami Y. Höhfeld J. Ohtsuka K.

Nature. 1994; 370: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the ability of Hsp70 and Hsp40 chaperones to facilitate refolding or proteolysis of mutant protein may be a key factor for neuronal cells to defend themselves against the toxic properties of expanded polyglutamine tract. The studies reported here demonstrate that overexpression of chaperones, especially a combination of Hsp70 and Hsp40, reduces aggregate formation and apoptosis in cultured neuronal cells expressing truncated androgen receptor protein with an expanded polyglutamine tract. Human AR cDNAs containing 24 or 97 CAG repeats (18.Kobayashi Y. Miwa S. Merry D.E. Kume A. Li M. Doyu M. Sobue G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) were subcloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). After the constructs were digested with AflII and blunt-ended, the polymerase chain reaction-amplified coding sequence of GFP (0.8 kilobase) was inserted into the digested constructs to create truncated AR constructs (24 CAG repeats, 215 N-terminal amino acids; 97 CAG repeats, 442 N-terminal amino acids of AR). Construction of pCMV-Hsp70 was described as previously (41.Michels A.A. Kanon B. Konings A.W.T. Ohtsuka K. Bensaude O. Kampinga H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33283-33289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). For the construction of pRC-Hsp40, a 1.5-kilobaseEcoRI fragment containing the entire coding region of human Hsp40 (43.Ohtsuka K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) was excised from the cDNA clone and subcloned in pRC/CMV (Invitrogen). For the construction of pRC-Hsdj, the polymerase chain reaction-amplified coding sequence of Hsdj (1.1 kilobase) (44.Oh S. Iwahori A. Kato S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1174: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) was subcloned in pRC/CMV. All the constructs used here were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Anti-Hsp70 Ab (rabbit polyclonal IgG) (45.Ohtsuka K. Tanabe K. Nakamura H. Sato C. Radiat. Res. 1986; 108: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and anti-Hsp40 Ab (rabbit polyclonal IgG) (46.Hattori H. Liu Y.-C. Tohnai I. Ueda M. Kaneda T. Kobayashi T. Tanabe K. Ohtsuka K. Cell Struct. Funct. 1992; 17: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) were previously described. To raise an antibody against human Hsdj (anti-Hsdj Ab), a 50 N-terminal amino acid-deleted Hsdj recombinant protein was used for immunization in rabbit and affinity-purified. 2K. Ohtsuka and M. Hata, manuscript in preparation. Anti-hemagglutinin Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with Cy-3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were employed. Transient expression of truncated AR and/or chaperones in Neuro2a cell line (mouse neuroblastoma cell) was accomplished by transfection with Effectene (Qiagen) in a four-chamber slide (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) coated with rat tail collagen (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. After overnight incubation with transfection reagents, transfected cells were cultured in differentiation medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum and 20 μm retinoic acid). At each time point (0, 24, 48, and 72 h) after transfection, cells were fixed with methanol for 5 min at room temperature, followed by counter staining with propidium iodide (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and mounted in Gelvatol. Hsp70, Hsp40 or Hsdj were detected with anti-Hsp70 Ab (1:100), anti-Hsp40 Ab (1:100), or anti-Hsdj Ab (1:10), respectively, incubated at 4 °C for overnight, and subsequently stained with anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with Cy-3. Counter stain was done with Hoechst33258 (Molecular Probes) or TOTO-3 (Molecular Probes). The cells were assayed for the presence of fragmented DNA by TUNEL assay using a DeadEndTM Apoptosis Detection Kit (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's protocol with minor modification. Briefly, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at each time point (0, 24, 48, and 72 h) after transfection. Fixed cells were incubated with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase to be incorporated with biotinylated deoxynucleotides, subsequently stained with Streptavidin-Texas Red conjugate (Life Technologies, Inc.) and Hoechst33258. A laser confocal scan microscope (MRC1024, Bio-Rad) and a conventional fluorescent microscope were used for quantitative analysis. Duplicate slides were graded blindly in two independent trials. Each slide had over 200 transfected cells. Cells were categorized by localization of aggregates: total aggregate-positive, which are cells containing aggregates in cytoplasm and/or nucleus, and nuclear aggregate-positive, which are cells containing aggregates in nucleus. The frequency was calculated as the number of indicated signal-positive cells divided by that of GFP-positive cells. 48 h after transfection, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Insoluble debris was pelleted, and the protein concentration of the supernatant was determined using a DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). A 20-μg sample was electrophoresed on a standard sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to Hybond-P (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Blots were probed with the indicated antibodies using standard techniques and developed with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The signal intensity was quantified by densitometry. Relative signal intensity (R.S.I.) was computed as the signal intensity of indicated lanes divided by that of nontransfected cells. Neuro2a cells (500,000 cells/60-mm culture dish) were cotransfected with truncated ARs (tAR24 or tAR97) and chaperones as described above. Cells were plated at a density of 5,000/well in 96-well dish just after transfection. Transfected cells were cultured in 100 μl/well of differentiation medium. 20 μl/well of CellTiter 96® Aqueous One Solution (Promega) was added at each time point (0, 24, 48, and 72 h) after transfection. After 4 h of incubation at 37 °C, the absorbance at 490 nm was recorded using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader. The background absorbance of medium alone was subtracted from these data. The proliferation index was calculated as the mean absorbance of cells at the indicated time point divided by the mean absorbance of cells just after transfection. GST-tAR65-HA was purified as described previously (24.Merry D.E. Kobayashi Y. Bailey C.K. Taye A.A. Fischbeck K.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 693-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Construction of His-tagged human Hsp40 was as described (40.Minami Y. Höhfeld J. Ohtsuka K. Hart F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19617-19624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) and expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21. Cells were grown at 37 °C to around 0.8 at A 600 and induced for 2 h with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyanoside. His-Hsp40 was purified with TALON kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) according to a manufacture's protocol. A bacterial expression plasmid, pTE-Hsc70, which contains human heat shock cognate 70 (Hsc70) cDNA, was a kind gift of Dr. N. Imamoto (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan). Hsc-70 was purified as described previously (47.Imamoto N. Matsoka Y. Kurihara T. Kohno K. Miyagi M. Sakiyama F. Okada Y. Tsunasawa S. Yoneda Y. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1047-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). 5 pmol of GST-tAR65-HA was incubated with 100 pm of recombinant Hsc70 and/or Hsp40 in reaction buffer (100 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 5 mm ATP, and 5 mmMgCl2). The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, terminated with equal amount of 2× SDS Laemmli loading buffer and subjected to Western blot as described above. The signal intensity was quantified by densitometry. Aggregate index was computed as the signal intensity of aggregate band divided by that of monomer band. Results were analyzed using analysis of variance and Student'st test if appropriate from Statview software version 5. We first examined whether truncated and expanded AR (tAR97) forms aggregate and is toxic to Neuro2a cell line. Transient expression of tAR97 induced aggregate formation in cytoplasm and/or nucleus and cellular toxicity in Neuro2a cell line (Figs. 1 and2). 72 h after transfection, over 90% of transfected cells (92.8 ± 1.1%) had aggregates. As for the localization of aggregate, the longer the cells transfected with tAR97 were cultured, the larger the proportion of nuclear aggregate-positive cells was. 72 h after transfection, more than 80% of transfected cells (86.4 ± 1.6%) had nuclear aggregates (Fig. 2 B). Moreover, most of the apoptotic cells had nuclear aggregates, whereas cells containing cytoplasmic aggregate alone had few apoptotic cells (Fig. 3). In contrast, the cells transfected with tAR24 had few aggregates and few apoptotic cells (Figs. 1 and 2). The neuronal cultured cell model has shown nuclear aggregates, which are pathological hallmark of CAG repeat disease, and an apoptosis, which might be mediated by cellular toxicity of expanded polyglutamine tract. These results indicate that this neuronal cultured cell model could be utilized as a cell model of SBMA. We thus employed this cell model for further studies.Figure 2Frequency of cells with aggregate, nuclear aggregate, or apoptosis in transfecting Neuro2a cells with tAR-GFP constructs.

Endogenous chaperones in tAR97-transfected and nontransfected Neuro2a cells were discernible predominantly in cytoplasm with limited nuclear staining. Laser confocal microscopic analysis has demonstrated that the endogenous chaperones Hsp70, Hsp40, and Hsdj are up-regulated in the cells containing aggregates and clearly colocalized with aggregates irrespective of the localization of aggregate (Fig.4). These data had suggested that the cells transfected with tAR97 induce the expression levels of chaperones to protect themselves against a cellular toxicity of expanded polyglutamine tract. However, the amount of induced endogenous chaperones might be insufficient to protect themselves, because the suppression of protein aggregation by chaperone requires a relatively large molar excess of chaperones (48.Lu Z. Cyr D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5970-5978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). To determine whether a sufficient amount of chaperones could be effective to protect cells against a cellular toxicity of expanded polyglutamine tract, we had overexpressed chaperones in cotransfection with tAR97 in the cell model of SBMA. Overexpression of both Hsp70 and Hsp40 or Hsp70 alone significantly reduces both aggregate formation and cell death, whereas overexpression of Hsdj/Hdj2 alone shows little effect. Especially, Hsp70 and Hsp40 in combination displayed the strongest effects in both the reduction of aggregate formation and the suppression of apoptosis (Figs. 5 and6 and TableI). In addition, overexpression of both Hsp70 and Hsdj/Hdj2 or Hsp40 alone was less effective to reduce aggregate formation and cell death than overexpression of both Hsp70 and Hsp40 or Hsp70 alone. Furthermore, there was a parallel correlation between the reduction of aggregate formation and the suppression of apoptosis in these cotransfected experiments.Figure 6Frequency of cells with aggregate, nuclear aggregate, or apoptosis in cotransfecting Neuro2a cells with tAR-GFP and chaperones.

https://openalex.org/W1992215701,"The de novo pathway of sphingolipid synthesis has been identified recently as a novel means of generating ceramide during apoptosis. Furthermore, it has been suggested that the activation of dihydroceramide synthase is responsible for increased ceramide production through this pathway. In this study, accumulation of ceramide mass in Molt-4 human leukemia cells by the chemotherapy agent etoposide was found to occur primarily due to activation of thede novo pathway. However, when the cells were labeled with a substrate for dihydroceramide synthase in the presence of etoposide, there was no corresponding increase in labeled ceramide. Further investigation using a labeled substrate for serine palmitoyltransferase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the pathway, resulted in an accumulation of label in ceramide upon etoposide treatment. This result suggests that the activation of serine palmitoyltransferase is the event responsible for increased ceramide generation during de novo synthesis initiated by etoposide. Importantly, the ceramide generated from de novo synthesis appears to have a distinct function from that induced by sphingomyelinase action in that it is not involved in caspase-induced poly (ADP-ribose)polymerase proteolysis but does play a role in disrupting membrane integrity in this model system. These results implicate serine palmitoyltransferase as the enzyme controlling de novo ceramide synthesis during apoptosis and begin to define a unique function of ceramide generated from this pathway.

The agents that induce ceramide generation include physiological factors, such as tumor necrosis factor and the Fas ligand, as well as therapeutic agents, such as chemotherapy drugs and radiation. Many of these agents induce ceramide generation via the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin by the activation of one or more sphingomyelinases. Additional studies, however, have begun to implicate ceramide generated from the de novo pathway of sphingolipid synthesis as having a signaling function (1.Bose R. Verheij M. Haimovitz-Friedman A.

Studies of de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis have been advanced by the realization that a class of fungal metabolites known as fumonisins share structural similarities with the sphingoid backbone. During investigation of the effects of fumonisin on sphingolipid metabolism in hepatocytes, it was observed that the synthesis of complex sphingolipids was significantly inhibited. It was also determined that the primary site of action of fumonisin was dihydroceramide synthase (9.Wang E. Norred W.P. Bacon C.W. Riley R.T. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14486-14490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an enzyme in the de novopathway that catalyzes the N-acylation of sphinganine to produce dihydroceramide. Because ceramide has been implicated as a regulatory molecule in apoptosis, more recent studies have used fumonisins to investigate the potential role of ceramide from the de novo pathway in this process. These studies have demonstrated that fumonisin is able to attenuate apoptosis induced by daunorubicin, camptothecin, tumor necrosis factor-α, and phorbol ester (1.Bose R. Verheij M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Scotto K. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1995; 82: 405-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar, 3.Suzuki A. Iwasaki M. Kato M. Wagai N. Exp.

Chem. 1998; 273: 16521-16526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Because fumonisin inhibits dihydroceramide synthase, it generally has been assumed that this is the regulatory step in the de novo pathway during apoptosis. In this study, we have used the chemotherapy agent etoposide to activate de novo ceramide synthesis in Molt-4 human leukemia cells. In preliminary experiments, we were unable to find any evidence for activation of dihydroceramide synthase, and we became interested in determining the regulatory point in de novo ceramide synthesis under apoptotic conditions with etoposide. Using intact cell radiolabeling techniques and cell-free enzyme assays, we determined that serine palmitoyltransferase, the initial and rate-limiting enzyme in the pathway, is activated during apoptosis and governs the production of ceramide. We were also interested in elucidating a regulatory function for ceramide generated de novo in apoptosis, and our present studies demonstrate that it has its predominant effects on membrane-related events in apoptosis. Importantly, unlike short-chain ceramide or ceramide generated from sphingomyelinase action, this ceramide is dissociated from caspase activation. This study provides the first evidence that serine palmitoyltransferase is a regulated enzyme during apoptosis and provides further evidence that ceramide generated de novo functions as a regulatory molecule in mediating membrane-related apoptotic events. Ceramide standards were derived from phospholipase C hydrolysis of brain sphingomyelin and were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and [9,10-3H]palmitic acid (43 Ci/mmol) were from NEN Life Science Products. [3H]Sphinganine was synthesized as described previously (10.Bielawska A. Szulc Z. Hannun Y.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 311: 518-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). [9,10-3H]palmitoyl CoA (60 Ci/mmol) andl-[3H]serine (20 Ci/mmol) were purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). A rabbit polyclonal antibody raised to an epitope in the automodification domain of human poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)1 was a gift of Dr. Guy Poirier of Laval University (Ste Foy, Quebec, Canada). Molt-4 cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in RPMI medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were subcultured prior to reaching a density of 2 × 106/ml. Molt-4 cells were seeded at 5 × 105/ml (3 mls/well in a 6-well plate). After treatments, ceramide mass was determined using the diglyceride kinase assay as described previously (11.Van Veldhoven P.P. Bishop W.R. Yurivich D.A. Bell R.M. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1995; 36: 21-30PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 105cells were lysed in a mixture of chloroform and methanol (1:2), and lipids were extracted according to Bligh and Dyer (12.Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42689) Google Scholar). Lipids were solubilized in dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol/β-octylglucoside mixed micelles for 30 min at 37 °C. Three μg of membranes from E.coli strain N4830/pJW10 overexpressing diglyceride kinase were added, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of 3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) in the presence of 1 mm carrier ATP. After 30 min at room temperature, the reaction was quenched with chloroform/methanol (1:2) and the lipids extracted by the Bligh-Dyer method. After evaporation of the chloroform phase under N2, the lipid pellet was suspended in 40 μl of chloroform/methanol (4:1) and spotted on silica gel 60 TLC plates. The lipids were chromatographed in a solvent system of chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (10:4:3:2:1). After autoradiography, the location of ceramide phosphate was determined based upon the R F (0.48) of phosphorylated ceramide standards. Radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Ceramide mass was then determined using the slope of the standard curve and normalized to lipid phosphate. Lipid phosphate was measured by acid hydrolysis of a Bligh-Dyer extract from 106 Molt-4 cells. The chloroform phase of the extract was evaporated under N2, and the lipids were incubated at 150 °C for 6 h in 0.6 ml of 10 n H2SO4/70% HClO4/H2O (9:1:40). After acid hydrolysis, 0.6 ml of H2O, 0.5 ml of 0.9% ammonium molybdate, and 0.2 ml of 9.0% ascorbic acid were added and incubated for 30 min at 45 °C. Inorganic phosphate was detected by absorbance at 820 nm and quantified based upon a standard curve of K2HPO4. Molt-4 cells were suspended at 5 × 105/ml in RPMI medium with 2% fetal calf serum. Five ml of this suspension were added to each flask, and cells were labeled with either 0.1 μCi of [3H]sphinganine (0.045 μCi/nmol) or 5 μCi of [3H]palmitate (43 Ci/mmol). Concurrent with the addition of radionuclide, etoposide and inhibitors of de novo synthesis were added. After 6 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C. Lipids were then extracted according to Bligh and Dyer (12.Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42689) Google Scholar). Lipid extracts from cells labeled with [3H]sphinganine were immediately run on TLC. Lipids extracted from [3H]palmitate-labeled cells were first submitted to mild alkaline hydrolysis prior to separation by TLC. The solvent system employed was chloroform/methanol/2 nNH4OH, 4:1:0.1. After chromatography, a ceramide standard (R F = 0.77) was identified by the use of iodine vapors. The TLC plates were then sprayed lightly with En3hance, and radioactivity was visualized by autoradiography after 48 h at –80 °C. The radioactive spot migrating with the same R F as the ceramide standard was scraped from the plate and quantified by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Total cellular RNA was isolated from 2.5 × 106 human Molt-4 cells at each time point that had been treated with 10 μmetoposide or left untreated at 37 °C. RNA was subjected to RT-PCR on a Roche Molecular Biochemicals LightCycler as follows: a 20-μl reaction containing 200 ng of RNA, 0.25 μm each primer, 5 mm MgCl2, 1× LightCycler RT-PCR reaction mixture SYBR Green, and 1× LightCycler RT-PCR enzyme mixture was amplified in a LightCycler capillary. The sample was reverse transcribed at 55 °C for 10 min and heated to 95 °C for 30 s. The resulting cDNA was amplified for 45 cycles by denaturation at 95 °C for 1 s, primer annealing at 55 °C for 10 s, and elongation at 72 °C for 20 s. One fluorescence reading was taken in each cycle following the elongation step. The primers used were as follows: human b-actin, 5′-TCCTGTGGCATCCACGAAACT-3′ and 5′-GAAGCATTTGCGGTGGACGAT-3′; human serine palmitoyltransferase subunit 1 (hLCB1), 5′-AGGAGTCACTGAACACTATG-3′ and 5′-AGCTCTCTCCAGTTCTTCCT-3′; and human serine palmitoyltransferase subunit 2 (hLCB2), 5′-GTGGATGTTATGATGGGAACG-3′ and 5′-CATACGTCGTCTCGTCAAAG-3′. The GenBankTM accession numbers for these genes are as follows: b-actin, X00351; hLCB1, Y08685; and hLCB2, Y08686. Serine palmitoyltransferase was assayed as described previously (13.Williams R.D. Wang E. Merrill Jr., A.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 228: 282-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Briefly, enzyme activity in 100 μg of microsomal membranes was determined in 100 mm Hepes (pH 8.3), 5 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mm EDTA (pH 7.4), and 50 μm pyridoxal 5′-phosphate. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 200 μm palmitoyl CoA and 2 μCi of l-[3H]serine, with a final serine concentration of 1 mm. Reactions were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C prior to termination with 0.2 ml of 0.5 N NaOH. Organic soluble counts were extracted as described previously and quantified by liquid scintillation counting (13.Williams R.D. Wang E. Merrill Jr., A.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 228: 282-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Dihydroceramide synthase was assayed according to Bose et al. (1.Bose R. Verheij M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Scotto K. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1995; 82: 405-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). Briefly, the dihydroceramide synthase activity in 50 μg of microsomal membranes was determined in 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 2 mm MgCl2, 20 μm fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, and 20 μm sphinganine. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 70 μmpalmitoyl CoA containing 0.5 μCi of [3H]palmitoyl CoA and allowed to incubate for 30 min at 37 °C. Lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (12.Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42689) Google Scholar) and resolved by thin layer chromatography in a solvent system of chloroform/methanol/2n NH4OH (4:1.0:0.1). Radioactivity comigrating with a ceramide standard was scraped from the plate and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. PARP proteolysis was determined as described previously (14.Perry D.K. Smyth M.J. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Duriez P. Poirier G.G. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18530-18533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Approximately 5 × 105cells were lysed by boiling in Laemmli buffer, and the lysate was electrophoresed on a 6% polyacrylamide gel. After transferring proteins to nitrocellulose, the blot was incubated for 1 h with rabbit anti-PARP (1:2000), and detection was performed by enhanced chemilumenescence using peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (1:5000). Molt-4 cells were suspended at 5 × 105/ml in RPMI medium with 2% fetal calf serum. Two ml of the cell suspension were aliquoted into the wells of a 12-well plate. Cells were treated simultaneously with etoposide and fumonisin. After 9 or 24 h, 0.5 ml of cells was removed from the well, harvested by centrifugation, and suspended in 0.2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. Following the addition of 0.2 ml of 0.4% trypan blue solution, cells were examined with a light microscope for trypan blue staining. The chemotherapy agent etoposide initiates an apoptotic response by inhibiting topoisomerase II, resulting in single-stranded DNA breaks (15.Chen G.L. Yang L. Rowe T.C. Halligan B.D. Tewey K.M. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13560-13566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Through unknown mechanisms, this insult by etoposide results in the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria (16.Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4405) Google Scholar), activation of caspases (17.Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Ottaviano Y. Davidson N.E. Poirier G.G. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3976-3985PubMed Google Scholar), DNA fragmentation (18.Kaufmann S.H. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5870-5878PubMed Google Scholar), and subsequent cell death (reviewed in Ref. 19.Kaufmann S.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 195-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Because ceramide has been shown to be an inducer of these events (20.Zhang P. Liu B. Kang S.W. Seok M. Rhee S.G. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30615-30618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 21.Smyth M.J. Perry D.K. Zhang J. Poirier G.G. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Biochem.

Science. 1993; 259: 1769-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1610) Google Scholar), we were interested in determining whether etoposide elevated ceramide levels and, if so, in determining the origin of ceramide. As demonstrated in Fig.1, treatment with etoposide resulted in a nearly 3-fold elevation of ceramide after 6 h. In the presence of fumonisin, an inhibitor of de novo ceramide synthesis, etoposide-induced ceramide accumulation was decreased by nearly 75% after 6 h. To determine whether induction of de novoceramide generation was occurring by activation of dihydroceramide synthase as previously reported using daunorubicin (1.Bose R. Verheij M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Scotto K. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1995; 82: 405-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar), cells were radiolabeled with [3H]sphinganine, the substrate for this enzyme (Fig. 2), and simultaneously treated with 10 μm etoposide. Using this method and measuring [3H]ceramide over a 9-h time course with etoposide, no increased incorporation of label into ceramide was observed (Fig. 3 A). This result suggests that neither dihydroceramide synthase nor the subsequent enzyme in de novo synthesis, dihydroceramide desaturase, is responsible for increased synthesis of ceramide.Figure 3Effect of etoposide on the incorporation of [3H]sphinganine into [3H]ceramide. A, Molt-4 cells were treated simultaneously with [3H]sphinganine and 10 μm etoposide for 1–9 h. At the indicated time points, cells were harvested as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and [3H]ceramide was quantified. Each column represents the percent of [3H]ceramide relative to the ceramide level in a control at that time point. Error bars represent the S.D. of triplicate samples. B, simultaneous with the addition of [3H]sphinganine, Molt-4 cells were treated with 10 μm etoposide (lane 2) or 50 μmfumonisin (lane 3) alone or with etoposide and fumonisin (lane 4). After 6 h, the cells were processed as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and3H-labeled lipids were analyzed by TLC and autoradiography.Lane 1, vehicle-treated control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In a similar experiment using a 6 h time period of etoposide treatment in the absence or presence of fumonisin, the incorporation of [3H]sphinganine into [3H]ceramide was significantly inhibited (Fig. 3 B), consistent with the reported inhibition of dihydroceramide synthase by fumonisin (23.Merrill Jr., A.H. van Echten G. Wang E. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27299-27306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lack of an increase in de novo ceramide synthesis using a dihydroceramide synthase substrate indicated a prior step in the pathway as the site of activation. Cells were therefore radiolabeled with [3H]palmitate, a precursor to the serine palmitoyltransferase substrate palmitoyl CoA, and simultaneously treated with etoposide. An increase of over 3-fold in [3H]ceramide was observed by 9 h (Fig.4 A), suggesting that serine palmitoyltransferase, the rate-limiting enzyme in de novosynthesis of sphingolipids, is activated during de novosynthesis of ceramide under apoptotic stress. Moreover, both fumonisin and cycloserine, an inhibitor of serine palmitoyltransferase (24.Williams R.D. Sgoutas D.S. Zaatari G.S. Santoianni R.A. J. Lipid Res. 1987; 28: 1478-1481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), inhibited the incorporation of [3H]palmitate into [3H]ceramide during a 6 h time period of etoposide treatment (Fig. 4 B). Previously, it had been demonstrated that during irradiation of keratinocytes, RNA levels of LCB2, a serine palmitoyltransferase subunit, were up-regulated (25.Farrell A.M. Uchida Y. Nagiec M.M. Harris I.R. Dickson R.C. Elias P.M. Holleran W.M. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 2031-2038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, in order to understand the regulation of serine palmitoyltransferase activity during etoposide-induced apoptosis, we initially determined mRNA levels of the LCB1 and LCB2 subunits of serine palmitoyltransferase by RT-PCR. No increases in the message level of either subunit were observed. In contrast, the serine palmitoyltransferase RNA was degraded by 6 h of etoposide treatment (Table I). Because up-regulation of RNA was not responsible for increased enzyme activity,in vitro enzyme assays for serine palmitoyltransferase were conducted using microsomes from either control- or etoposide-treated cells. Over a 6-h course of treatment, serine palmitoyltransferase activity was elevated early (by 0.5 h) and sustained throughout the treatment (Fig. 5). These results rule out etoposide-induced activation of serine palmitoyltransferase by up-regulation of RNA and suggest activation by covalent modification or allosteric regulation of the enzyme.Table IRT-PCR of actin, hLCB1, and hLCB2 RNA in etoposide-treated Molt-4 cellsTime (h)0246Actin01.4 ± 1.1−0.8 ± 0.6−4.7 ± 0.3hLCB10−0.7 ± 0.3−3.1 ± 2.1−28.9 ± 12.5hLCB20−0.8 ± 0.5−2.0 ± 1.0−68.3 ± 46.1Data are expressed as the fold increase/decrease ± S.E. relative to a time-matched control.

Because we and others have previously demonstrated that short-chain ceramide induces PARP proteolysis by caspase activation (21.Smyth M.J. Perry D.K. Zhang J. Poirier G.G. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 26.Mizushima N. Koike R. Kohsaka H. Kushi Y. Handa S. Yagita H. Miyasaka N. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and because etoposide had previously been demonstrated to cause PARP proteolysis (18.Kaufmann S.H. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5870-5878PubMed Google Scholar), we were interested in determining whether the de novo generation of ceramide by etoposide was also instrumental in this caspase-mediated event. In the presence of fumonisin, etoposide-induced de novo ceramide generation returned to basal levels yet PARP proteolysis was unaffected (Figs. 4 B and 6). This result demonstrates that de novo ceramide generation is not necessary for the activation of a PARP-cleaving caspase(s) in this cell system. In addition, we have also examined the effect of fumonisin on lamin B cleavage by etoposide, reportedly occurring by caspase-6 (27.Takahashi A. Alnemri E.S. Lazebnik Y.A. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Moir R.D. Goldman R.D. Poirier G.G. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8395-8400Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), and found no inhibition (data not shown). Additional studies using the chromogenic caspase substrates YVAD-pNA, DEVD-pNA, and IETD-pNA were also conducted. These peptides function as substrates for group I, group II, and group III caspases, respectively (28.Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1844) Google Scholar). Whereas etoposide induced both DEVD-pNA and IETD-pNA peptidase activity, fumonisin was without an inhibitory effect (data not shown). These results are consistent with prior studies demonstrating etoposide activation of caspase-3 (of which DEVD-pNA is a substrate), and caspase-6 (of which IETD-pNA is a substrate) in human leukemia cells (29.Martins L.M. Kottke T. Mesner P.W. Basi G.S. Sinha S. Frigon Jr., N. Tatar E. Tung J.S. Bryant K. Takahashi A. Svingen P.A. Madden B.J. McCormick D.J. Earnshaw W.C. Kaufmann S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7421-7430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Furthermore, they provide evidence for the dissociation of de novogenerated ceramide from caspase activation and serve to distinguish its function from both ceramide generated from sphingomyelinases and from exogenous short-chain ceramides, both of which have been implicated in activation of caspases (21.Smyth M.J. Perry D.K. Zhang J. Poirier G.G. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 26.Mizushima N. Koike R. Kohsaka H. Kushi Y. Handa S. Yagita H. Miyasaka N. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 30.Dbaibo G.S. Perry D.K. Gamard C.J. Platt R. Poirier G.G. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Finally, we were interested in determining whether the inhibition of de novo generated ceramide by fumonisin protected cells from death. Because noticeable cell death did not occur during the first 6 h of treatment with etoposide, we assayed cell death at 9 or 24 h after treatment and observed nearly 15 and 75% cell death, respectively, as determined by trypan blue staining (Fig. 7). When the cells were treated during this period with either fumonisin or zVAD-fmk, a pancaspase inhibitor, cell death was approximately 7% after 9 h and 30% after 24 h. Interestingly, when fumonisin and zVAD-fmk were added together, near complete protection from cell death was observed. These results suggest that ceramide from de novo synthesis and caspases contribute to independent pathways of death during etoposide-induced apoptosis. The results from this study provide the first evidence that the initial and rate-limiting enzyme in the de novo pathway of sphingolipid biosynthesis, serine palmitoyltransferase, is activated during apoptosis. They also provide further support for a regulatory role in apoptosis of ceramide generated from the de novopathway. Currently, very little is known about the function of serine palmitoyltransferase other than its role in sphingolipid synthesis for housekeeping functions, but studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae have begun to define a role for the enzyme in stress response signaling. A yeast strain lacking serine palmitoyltransferase activity has been identified that is unable to grow unless supplemented with sphingoid bases (31.Buede R. Rinker-Schaffer C. Pinto W.J. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4325-4332Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Suppressors of this mutation have also been isolated that are able to grow at ambient temperature but are unable to survive hyperosmolar or heat stress (32.Patton J.L. Srinivasan B. Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7180-7184Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The suppressor strains could be rescued, however, either by transfection with the serine palmitoyltransferase or by supplying exogenous sphingoid bases (33.Jenkins G.M. Richards A. Wahl T. Mao C. Obeid L. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32566-32572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), thus implicating serine palmitoyltransferase in both heat and osmotic stress responses. In mammalian cells, it has been demonstrated that sphingoid bases are capable of down-regulating serine palmitoyltransferase (34.Mandon E.C. van Echten G. Birk R. Schmidt R.R. Sandhoff K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and that the activity of the enzyme progressively increases during the differentiation process of neuronal cells in culture (35.Chigorno V. Negroni E. Nicolini M. Sonnino S. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1163-1169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, a recent report indicated that 48 h after UV irradiation of keratinocytes, mRNA levels for the LCB2 subunit of serine palmitoyltransferase were up-regulated 1.7-fold and that this corresponded to a 1.5-fold increase in enzyme activity (25.Farrell A.M. Uchida Y. Nagiec M.M. Harris I.R. Dickson R.C. Elias P.M. Holleran W.M. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 2031-2038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results suggest that caution should be used in interpreting data obtained with the dihydroceramide synthase inhibitor, fumonisin. An inhibition of ceramide accumulation with fumonisin, although implicating de novo synthesis, does not imply that dihydroceramide synthase is the regulatory enzyme. Such a result would also be consistent with a regulatory role of any of the preceding enzymes in the pathway. In two recent studies of phorbol ester- and daunorubicin-induced apoptosis mediated by de novo ceramide synthesis, in vitro assays of dihydroceramide synthase indicated that the V max was increased 1.6–1.7-fold after treatment (1.Bose R. Verheij M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Scotto K. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1995; 82: 405-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar, 5.Garzotto M. White-Jones M. Jiang Y. Ehleiter D. Liao W.-C. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2260-2264PubMed Google Scholar). However, in our intact cell [3H]sphinganine labeling experiment using etoposide or using an in vitro enzyme assay (data not shown), we found no evidence that dihydroceramide synthase is activated during de novo synthesis in response to etoposide. The enzymes of the de novo pathway (Fig. 2) leading to the production of ceramide reside on the endoplasmic reticulum (36.Mandon E.C. Ehses I. Rother J. van Echten G. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11144-11148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In studies using hepatocytes, it was determined that the specific activity of serine palmitoyltransferase is considerably less than that of other enzymes in the pathway, including ketosphinganine reductase and dihydroceramide synthase. This fact, in conjunction with the observation of low sphingoid base levels in cells, has led to the conclusion that serine palmitoyltransferase is the rate-limiting enzyme in the pathway of sphingolipid biosynthesis (13.Williams R.D. Wang E. Merrill Jr., A.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 228: 282-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Because the concentrations of reactants for a rate-limiting enzyme are generally much higher than the products, the activation of such an enzyme would be expected to shift the reaction toward equilibrium and result in a deregulation of the pathway. Under the experimental conditions in this study, activation of serine palmitoyltransferase would therefore have the consequence of leading to accumulation of an end product of the pathway. Under normal conditions of de novo sphingolipid synthesis, ceramide is not typically considered an end product because it serves as a substrate for sphingomyelin synthase and glucosylceramide synthase, enzymes of complex sphingolipid synthesis. Whereas the enzymes of the de novo pathway (Fig. 2) leading to the production of ceramide reside on the endoplasmic reticulum (36.Mandon E.C. Ehses I. Rother J. van Echten G. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11144-11148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the sphingomyelin and glucosylceramide synthases are located on the Golgi apparatus and/or plasma membrane (37.Futerman A.H. Stieger B. Hubbard A.L. Pagano R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8650-8657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38.Jeckel D. Karrenbauer A. Burger K.N.J. van Meer G. Wieland F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Therefore, our data demonstrating the accumulation of ceramide from de novosynthesis indicate that either the transport of ceramide to these locations or the respective synthases may serve as additional regulatory points in this pathway during conditions of stress. Additionally, if etoposide induced the accumulation of de novo ceramide by inhibiting one of the enzymes that use ceramide as a substrate, similar accumulations of ceramide should have been observed with both palmitate and sphinganine as substrates in the intact cell labeling experiments. The observation that elevated ceramide was seen only with palmitate as a substrate further supports the conclusion that ceramide accumulation is primarily due to activation of serine palmitoyltransferase. We and others had previously shown that short-chain ceramide can induce PARP proteolysis and caspase activation (21.Smyth M.J. Perry D.K. Zhang J. Poirier G.G. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 26.Mizushima N. Koike R. Kohsaka H. Kushi Y. Handa S. Yagita H. Miyasaka N. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that ceramide produced by the action of sphingomyelinases is important for caspase activation (30.Dbaibo G.S. Perry D.K. Gamard C.J. Platt R. Poirier G.G. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrating a lack of involvement of de novo synthesized ceramide in the activation of caspases suggest that this pool of ceramide may have a unique signaling or regulatory function. Because the de novopathway synthesizes ceramide on the endoplasmic reticulum and because a signaling pool of ceramide has also been identified at the plasma membrane (39.Linardic C.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23530-23537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is plausible that these respective pools of ceramide employ different effector mechanisms. These studies with etoposide do not exclude the possibility that other inducers of de novo synthesis and/or other cell types regulate additional enzymes in the de novo pathway. Also, the results do not exclude the possibility of additional functions forde novo generated ceramide in the apoptotic response. However, it is clear that care should be exercised in defining the main sites of biochemical regulation in the de novo pathway using a combination of enzymatic and labeling studies. Care should also be exercised in determining what specific aspects of apoptosis are regulated (or not regulated) by the de novo pathway. The results from the trypan blue experiment suggest that de novo ceramide generated during apoptosis exerts a key regulatory function in effecting membrane damage. Furthermore, the additive and protective effect of fumonisin and a caspase inhibitor on cell death provide evidence that ceramide from de novo synthesis and caspases are activating independent pathways in apoptosis and suggest the model proposed in Fig. 8. In summary, the results from this study begin to define serine palmitoyltransferase as an important regulatory step in the de novo pathway of ceramide synthesis during apoptosis. Moreover, they dissociate this pathway from a role in caspase activation and implicate it in mediating membrane-related events in apoptosis.

In addition, α-synuclein is a major component of Lewy bodies, the pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (4.Spillantini M.G. Schmidt M.L. Lee M.-Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Jakes R. Goedert M.

It is unclear how the mutations affect the normal function of α-synuclein but a plausible hypothesis is that the normal localization of the protein is disrupted, causing α-synuclein to accumulate and aggregate as a component of Lewy bodies.The structure of α-synuclein may provide clues to its possible function. The N-terminal region contains 7 degenerate 11-amino acid imperfect repeat sequences predicted to form five amphipathic α-helices. α-Synuclein is predicted to have a random coil conformation in solution (6.Weinreb P.H. Zhen W. Poon A.W. Conway K.A. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13709-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar); however, when studied in the presence of synthetic membranes, lipid binding is accompanied by an increase in α-helicity (7.Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9443-9449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar), suggesting that, in an isolated system, α-synuclein may be membrane-associated. In addition, the Ala-30 → Pro mutation (but not the Ala-53 → Thr mutation) was recently found to abolish the binding of α-synuclein to rat brain vesicles in a crude vesicle preparation, suggesting that this may lead to the accumulation of the protein and, as a result, its assembly into Lewy bodies (8.Jensen P.H. Nielsen M.S. Jakes R. Dotti C.G. Goedert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26292-26294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar).Here we applied a novel digital confocal microscopy technique, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET),1 which extends the resolution of fluorescence microscopy to the molecular level (<100 Å) to examine 1) the interaction of α-synuclein with membranes and 2) its conformation in intact neurons. We demonstrate that the N and C termini of α-synuclein are tightly associated with membranes but loosely associated with each other. Neither mutation has a detectable effect on membrane association, but the presence of the Ala-30 → Pro mutation induces an alteration in the three-dimensional structure of α-synuclein, bringing the N and C termini closer together.RESULTSBy using confocal microscopy, endogenous α-synuclein expression is detected weakly throughout the cell body, neurites, and even the nucleus of cultured primary neurons following immunostaining with H3C, a monoclonal antibody that recognizes amino acids 128–140 at the C-terminal end of α-synuclein (Fig.1 A). Transient transfection of primary cortical neurons with a wild-type α-synuclein expression construct also leads to a similar pattern with widespread, diffuse distribution of the protein throughout the cell body, neurites, and nucleus (Fig. 1 B). To detect endogenous α-synuclein expression, 10-fold greater laser power (30%) than that used to detect overexpressed, transfected α-synuclein (3%) is required. Transient transfection with constructs expressing the Parkinson's disease-associated mutations Ala-30 → Pro and Ala-53 → Thr shows equivalent staining to overexpressed wild-type α-synuclein. These mutations therefore appear to have no effect on the subcellular distribution of α-synuclein in primary neurons in culture (Fig. 1,C and D).To test the hypothesis that α-synuclein is tightly membrane-associated in intact cells, primary cortical neurons were transiently transfected with α-synuclein expression constructs, immunostained with H3C, and counterstained with the lipophilic fluorescent dye, DiI. Strikingly, a marked co-localization of α-synuclein with DiI-labeled membranes was detected using confocal scanning laser microscopy (Fig. 2).Figure 2α-Synuclein and DiI co-localize in cortical neurons. An α-synuclein expression construct (wild-type) was transfected into 7 DIV cortical neurons. Cells were fixed 24 h post-transfection and immunostained with H3C and a fluorescein-linked secondary antibody prior to counterstaining with the lipophilic fluorescent dye, DiI.

C, co-expression of α-synuclein and DiI. Areas of co-localization are represented by yellow hues(red + green) in the composite figure.Scale bar represents 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)It is possible that this apparent co-localization is due to the limitations of resolution of fluorescent confocal microscopy, which is on the order of 500 nm. Therefore, to determine if there is a close association of α-synuclein with cellular membranes, we used a FRET approach. FRET is dependent on the inverse 6th power of the intermolecular separation of the fluorophores and, under the conditions employed, can detect intermolecular associations between fluorophores only if they are <10 nm (<100 Å) apart or <30 nm apart for indirect immunofluorescence measurements. The experimental paradigm assessed FRET by measuring the donor fluorescence before (Fl D1) and after (Fl D2) photobleaching of the acceptor. The ratio ofFl D2/Fl D1 equals 1.0 in the absence of FRET. IfFl D2/Fl D1 is >1.0, the fluorophores must be within 10 nm with the magnitude of the ratio above 1.0 being directly proportional to the proximity of the fluorophores. No increase in donor fluorescence intensity was observed in regions adjacent to the discrete area of acceptor photobleaching. Likewise, when either the donor or acceptor were omitted, photobleaching of a discrete area with 568 nm light did not result in an increase in 522 nm emission. These results suggest that any increase in donor fluorescence intensity following photobleaching of the acceptor is due to the absence of the acceptor and is not due to a paradoxical reaction of the fluorescein molecule or background autofluorescence in response to exposure to 568 nm light.A strong FRET signal (Fl D2/Fl D1 = 1.58,n = 29, p < 0.0001) was observed between wild-type α-synuclein and DiI-labeled membranes using H3C immunoreactivity as a marker of α-synuclein (Fig.3). This demonstrates a tight intermolecular association between α-synuclein and DiI-labeled membranes, including the plasma membrane. As a control, we also examined FRET between EGFP, a known cytosolic protein, and DiI-labeled membranes and found it to be barely detectable (Fl D2/Fl D1 = 1.06,n = 11, p = 0.01) (Fig.4).Figure 3FRET occurs between α-synuclein and DiI. Cortical neurons were transfected with α-synuclein expression constructs (wild type). Transfected cells were detected immunohistochemically using H3C as described and counterstained with DiI.

The increase in donor fluorescence (fluorescein) following photobleaching of the acceptor molecule (DiI) was measured using both the C-terminal antibody for α-synuclein and the N-terminal antibody for α-synuclein, and the percent increase in donor fluorescence is shown. All α-synuclein variants (wild-type (WT), Ala-53 → Thr (A53T), and Ala-30 → Pro (A30P)) demonstrated increases in donor fluorescence significantly above zero (p < 0.0001, one group t test) and significantly greater than EGFP (p < 0.0005, ANOVA) but not significantly different from each other with either the C- or N-terminal antibody. In addition, there was no significant difference between N- and C-terminal measurements for either wild-type (p = 0.1776), Ala-53 → Thr (p = 0.9635), or Ala-30 → Pro (p = 0.1147), (ANOVA, Fisher PLSD post hoc test)View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Ala-30 → Pro mutation in α-synuclein was recently found to abolish the binding of α-synuclein to brain vesicles in isolated systems, suggesting that this may lead to the accumulation of the protein and, as a result, its assembly into Lewy bodies (8.Jensen P.H. Nielsen M.S. Jakes R. Dotti C.G. Goedert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26292-26294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that the Parkinson's disease-associated mutations, Ala-30 → Pro and Ala-53 → Thr, disrupt the observed membrane association, we used site-directed mutagenesis to generate α-synuclein expression constructs containing either mutation. Strong α-synuclein-membrane FRET signals were detected for both Parkinson's disease-associated mutations, Ala-30 → Pro (Fl D2/Fl D1 = 1.54,n = 31, p < 0.0001) and Ala-53 → Thr (Fl D2/Fl D1 = 1.60,n = 23, p < 0.0001). No significant differences were detected in the magnitude of the FRET signals among any of the α-synuclein variants (wild-type or mutant) (Fig. 4). This demonstrates that neither mutation has a strong effect on the closeness of association of the C terminus of α-synuclein to the membrane.Primary sequence data predicts the presence of five amphipathic α-helices within the N-terminal region of α-synuclein (11.Clayton D.F. George J.M. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 249-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Because the Parkinson's disease-associated mutations in α-synuclein are located toward the N-terminal region of the protein, we hypothesized that membrane association within this region may be disrupted by the presence of the mutations. We used an antibody directed toward the N-terminal region of α-synuclein (Sc7012, which detects amino acids 1–19) to investigate further the association of α-synuclein with DiI-labeled membranes and the effect of the Parkinson's disease mutations. By using the N-terminal antibody, we detected a strong FRET signal between wild-type α-synuclein and DiI-labeled membranes (Fl D2/Fl D1 = 1.68,n = 41, p < 0.0001) (Fig. 4). Both the Ala-30 → Pro (Fl D2/Fl D1= 1.66, n = 45, p < 0.0001) and the Ala-53 → Thr (Fl D2/Fl D1= 1.62, n = 33, p < 0.0001) variants demonstrated equivalent, tight, association with membranes. These data suggest that both the N and C termini of α-synuclein are tightly membrane-associated in intact neurons and that the Ala-30 → Pro and Ala-53 → Thr mutations do not substantially disrupt this association.We next examined the possibility that the N-terminal Parkinson's disease-associated mutations may disrupt the conformation of the protein. To investigate this possibility we used FRET to examine the relationship between the N- and the C-terminal regions in all α-synuclein variants. The magnitude of FRET was measured between the fluorescent tags rhodamine, linked to the N-terminal antibody Sc7012, and fluorescein, linked to the C-terminal antibody, H3C. Fig.5 demonstrates that FRET is detectable, although small in magnitude (Fl D2/Fl D1 = 1.07,n = 29, p < 0.0001), for wild-type α-synuclein, which indicates a weak interaction between the N- and C-terminal regions. Similarly, a weak interaction was observed with the Ala-53 → Thr mutation (Fl D2/Fl D1 = 1.06,n = 20, p < 0.0001). However, the Ala-30 → Pro variant demonstrates a statistically significant increase in the magnitude of the FRET signal compared with wild-type and Ala-53 → Thr α-synuclein measurements (1.6-fold,p = 0.0003, and 2.1-fold, p = 0.0028, respectively), which suggests that the N and C termini are closer to each other in this variant than in either the wild-type or the Ala-53 → Thr. Hence, the presence of the proline residue at position 30 significantly alters the three-dimensional conformation of α-synuclein.Figure 5The Ala-30 → Pro mutation significantly alters the FRET properties between the N and C termini of α-synuclein. FRET was measured between the N- and C-terminal regions of α-synuclein for each variant (wild-type, Ala-53 → Thr, and Ala-30 → Pro). There was a significant increase (*) in donor fluorescence for the Ala-30 → Pro variant compared with the wild-type (p = 0.0028) and Ala-53 → Thr (p = 0.0003) (ANOVA, Fisher PLSDpost hoc test).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONWe have developed an application of digital confocal microscopy combined with FRET to examine α-synuclein structure and its relationship to membranes in intact neurons. Our results support three major conclusions as follows: α-synuclein is tightly associated with cellular membranes in intact neurons; the Ala-53 → Thr and the Ala-30 → Pro mutations do not substantially alter the intracellular distribution of α-synuclein or the association of α-synuclein with membranes; and the N and C termini of α-synuclein are not closely apposed, although the presence of the Ala-30 → Pro mutation does alter the conformation of the N and C termini relative to one another.FRET approaches provide a powerful tool for understanding interactions between molecules and for analyzing protein structure because FRET measurements are extremely sensitive to the distance between fluorophores. Compared with other biophysical techniques, FRET is particularly advantageous because the experiments can be performed in intact neurons in culture. It is important to emphasize that FRET provides us with an opportunity to examine α-synuclein in a native conformation, interacting with normal cellular constituents, rather than in an isolated system. From this perspective, our application of FRET has certain advantages over biochemical methods using isolated components, even over microscopic techniques that have greater spatial resolution, such as electron microscopy, which require substantial sample processing, including dehydration.By using FRET, intermolecular distances can be estimated based on the strength of the FRET signal. The distance between the α-synuclein antibody complex and DiI-labeled membranes can be determined byR 6 =R 06(1/E − 1), whereR is the distance between donor and acceptor;R 0 is the distance between donor and acceptor where there is 50% energy transfer, and E is the fraction of donor molecules de-excited as a result of energy transfer to acceptor (12.Selvin P.R. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 246: 300-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). For cases in which fluorescein is the donor and DiI is the acceptor, R 0 has been experimentally estimated to be approximately 3.5 nm (35 Å) (13.Shahrokh Z. Verkman A.S. Shohet S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12082-12089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The exact distance between α-synuclein and the membrane must be viewed as approximate because the fluorescent molecule was located on an immunohistochemical tag rather than on α-synuclein itself. Nonetheless, even taking into account the size of an antibody molecule (∼11.5 nm (14.Ullman E. Schwarzberg M. Rubenstein K. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 4172-4178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), the greatest distance between α-synuclein and membranes must be <30 nm, suggesting a very close association.The magnitude of the FRET signal between the membrane and α-synuclein is the same using either H3C, an antibody directed toward the C-terminal region of α-synuclein, or Sc7012, an antibody directed toward the N-terminal region of α-synuclein. This suggests that both the C and N termini of α-synuclein are equally closely associated with membranes in intact cells. This differs somewhat from predictions made from primary sequence data that suggest amphipathic helices at the N-terminal domain and a presumed hydrophilic C-terminal domain (11.Clayton D.F. George J.M. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 249-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). There are two possible explanations for this apparent discrepancy as follows: 1) our technique is not sensitive enough to detect small differences between the strength of N- versus C-terminal association or 2) the relatively hydrophilic C terminus is “held in place” either by the three-dimensional conformation of α-synuclein or via interactions with other proteins. We favor the latter possibility because, as noted below, the N and C termini of α-synuclein are structurally close to one another (Fig. 5) and because C-terminally truncated α-synuclein readily assembles into filaments in vitro (15.Crowther R.A. Jakes R. Spillantini M.G. Goedert M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Furthermore, preliminary data suggest that the generation of a C terminus α-synuclein-EGFP fusion protein diminishes FRET between the C terminus and the membrane. 2P. J. McLean, unpublished observations. The FRET data are in good agreement with the observation that the structure of α-synuclein is stabilized by binding synthetic membranes (7.Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9443-9449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar) and the observation that α-synuclein binds to vesicles in isolated systems (8.Jensen P.H. Nielsen M.S. Jakes R. Dotti C.G. Goedert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26292-26294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). However, unlike the study of isolated vesicles (8.Jensen P.H. Nielsen M.S. Jakes R. Dotti C.G. Goedert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26292-26294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), in which the Ala-30 → Pro mutation abolished binding, we found that the Ala-30 → Pro mutation had no effect on the association of α-synuclein with DiI-labeled membranes in intact cells. In fact, neither Parkinson's disease-associated mutation (Ala-30 → Pro or Ala-53 → Thr) had an effect on the amount of FRET signal between the membrane and α-synuclein detected using either H3C or Sc7012. These results suggest that the mutations do not affect the association of α-synuclein with membranes in intact cells, although we cannot rule out an alteration of binding with a subset of membranes or organelles.FRET is also an important tool for assessing protein conformation. FRET was detected between the N and the C termini of α-synuclein, although the amount of FRET was barely above background. Models of α-synuclein structure predict a linear distance of ∼10 nm (100 Å) between the N and the C termini. 3D. Clayton, personal communication. Our results suggest that the conformation of α-synuclein is folded so that there is only a weak interaction between the N and C termini. Interestingly, the Ala-30 → Pro mutation appears to alter this folding, significantly enhancing the FRET signal by almost 2-fold, suggesting a closer association of the N and C termini in the mutant protein.Taken together, these data demonstrate a tight membrane interaction of α-synuclein in an intact neuronal cell culture system. The accumulation of α-synuclein in Lewy bodies, which are cytoplasmic inclusions, presumably requires membrane dissociation, misfolding, and aggregation of the protein. Future studies addressing the consequences of dissociation of α-synuclein from membranes, using tools such as the FRET application we describe, will be important to determine the mechanisms involved in the accumulation of α-synuclein in Lewy bodies in Parkinson's disease. Studies of the genetic basis of familial Parkinson's disease have led to the identification of two missense mutations in the gene encoding α-synuclein (Ala-53 → Thr and Ala-30 → Pro) in some families with early onset familial Parkinson's disease (1.Polymeropoulos M.H.

Neurol. 1998; 57: 334-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). It is unclear how the mutations affect the normal function of α-synuclein but a plausible hypothesis is that the normal localization of the protein is disrupted, causing α-synuclein to accumulate and aggregate as a component of Lewy bodies. The structure of α-synuclein may provide clues to its possible function. The N-terminal region contains 7 degenerate 11-amino acid imperfect repeat sequences predicted to form five amphipathic α-helices. α-Synuclein is predicted to have a random coil conformation in solution (6.Weinreb P.H. Zhen W. Poon A.W. Conway K.A. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13709-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar); however, when studied in the presence of synthetic membranes, lipid binding is accompanied by an increase in α-helicity (7.Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9443-9449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar), suggesting that, in an isolated system, α-synuclein may be membrane-associated. In addition, the Ala-30 → Pro mutation (but not the Ala-53 → Thr mutation) was recently found to abolish the binding of α-synuclein to rat brain vesicles in a crude vesicle preparation, suggesting that this may lead to the accumulation of the protein and, as a result, its assembly into Lewy bodies (8.Jensen P.H. Nielsen M.S. Jakes R. Dotti C.G. Goedert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26292-26294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Here we applied a novel digital confocal microscopy technique, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET),1 which extends the resolution of fluorescence microscopy to the molecular level (<100 Å) to examine 1) the interaction of α-synuclein with membranes and 2) its conformation in intact neurons. We demonstrate that the N and C termini of α-synuclein are tightly associated with membranes but loosely associated with each other. Neither mutation has a detectable effect on membrane association, but the presence of the Ala-30 → Pro mutation induces an alteration in the three-dimensional structure of α-synuclein, bringing the N and C termini closer together. RESULTSBy using confocal microscopy, endogenous α-synuclein expression is detected weakly throughout the cell body, neurites, and even the nucleus of cultured primary neurons following immunostaining with H3C, a monoclonal antibody that recognizes amino acids 128–140 at the C-terminal end of α-synuclein (Fig.1 A). Transient transfection of primary cortical neurons with a wild-type α-synuclein expression construct also leads to a similar pattern with widespread, diffuse distribution of the protein throughout the cell body, neurites, and nucleus (Fig. 1 B). To detect endogenous α-synuclein expression, 10-fold greater laser power (30%) than that used to detect overexpressed, transfected α-synuclein (3%) is required. Transient transfection with constructs expressing the Parkinson's disease-associated mutations Ala-30 → Pro and Ala-53 → Thr shows equivalent staining to overexpressed wild-type α-synuclein. These mutations therefore appear to have no effect on the subcellular distribution of α-synuclein in primary neurons in culture (Fig. 1,C and D).To test the hypothesis that α-synuclein is tightly membrane-associated in intact cells, primary cortical neurons were transiently transfected with α-synuclein expression constructs, immunostained with H3C, and counterstained with the lipophilic fluorescent dye, DiI. Strikingly, a marked co-localization of α-synuclein with DiI-labeled membranes was detected using confocal scanning laser microscopy (Fig. 2).It is possible that this apparent co-localization is due to the limitations of resolution of fluorescent confocal microscopy, which is on the order of 500 nm. Therefore, to determine if there is a close association of α-synuclein with cellular membranes, we used a FRET approach. FRET is dependent on the inverse 6th power of the intermolecular separation of the fluorophores and, under the conditions employed, can detect intermolecular associations between fluorophores only if they are <10 nm (<100 Å) apart or <30 nm apart for indirect immunofluorescence measurements. The experimental paradigm assessed FRET by measuring the donor fluorescence before (Fl D1) a"
https://openalex.org/W2067603487,"Cytokines have been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory cholestasis. This is due to transcriptional down-regulation of hepatic transporters including the Na+/bile acid cotransporter, ntcp, and the multispecific organic anion exporter, mrp2. We have recently shown that ntcp suppression by lipopolysaccharidein vivo is caused by down-regulation of transactivators including the previously uncharacterized Footprint B-binding protein. Both the ntcp FpB element and the mrp2 promoter contain potential retinoid-response elements. We hypothesized that retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR) heterodimers would activate these two genes and that cytokines that reduce bile flow might do so by suppressing nuclear levels of these transactivators. Retinoid transactivation and interleukin-1β down-regulation of thentcp and mrp2 promoters were mapped to RXRα:RARα-response elements. Gel mobility shift assays demonstrated specific binding of RXRα:RARα heterodimers to the ntcpand mrp2 retinoid-response elements. The RXRα:RARα complex was down-regulated by IL-1β in HepG2 cells. An unexpected finding was that an adjacent CAAT-enhancer-binding protein element was required for maximal transactivation of the ntcp promoter by RXRα:RARα. Taken together, these studies demonstrate regulation of two hepatobiliary transporter genes by RXRα:RARα and describe a mechanism which likely contributes to their down-regulation during inflammation.

Conditions such as sepsis, alcoholic, autoimmune and viral hepatitis, and parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease involve activation of hepatic inflammation. Cholestasis and hyperbilirubinemia are common clinical features of these disorders (1.Hill D. Shedlofsky S. McClain C. Diehl A.M. Tsukamoto H. Cytokines in Health and Disease. New York, NY1997: 401-425Google Scholar). As a principal target of inflammatory mediators, the liver regulates changes in hepatic protein synthesis during the acute phase response (4.Andus T. Bauer J. Gerok W. Hepatology. 1991; 13: 364-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 5.Moshage H. J. Pathol. 1997; 181: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, 6.Perlmutter D.H.

This can include reduction in the expression of several proteins involved in bile formation, and thus cholestasis can be categorized as a feature of the hepatic negative acute phase response (7.Bolder U.

Gastroenterology. 1997; 112: 302-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). These transport proteins include sodium/taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (ntcp) and bile salt export protein, which are the principal bile acid uptake and export proteins, respectively, as well as mrp2 (the multispecific organic anion exporter). Reduced function of the ntcp transporter leads to decreased bile acid uptake by the hepatocyte, whereas reduced function of the mrp2transporter leads to impaired excretion of bilirubin, glutathione, and numerous organic anions, as well as to reduction of the bile salt-independent component of bile flow (7.Bolder U.

Tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) are cytokines known to mediate acute phase changes in hepatic protein synthesis at the transcriptional level (6.Perlmutter D.H.

Today. 1994; 15: 74-80Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms linking down-regulation of the hepatic transporters during the acute phase response are not well understood. Recent studies in rodents have begun to elucidate these mechanisms. ntcp and mrp2 gene expression are profoundly down-regulated after administration of LPS or effector cytokines to rats (3.Kubitz R. Wettstein M. Warskulat U. Haussinger D. Gastroenterology. 1999; 116: 401-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 11.Green R.M. Beier D. Gollan J.L.

As recently shown in our laboratory, hepatic nuclear concentrations of two ntcp transactivators, hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF1) and Footprint B-binding protein (FpB BP), were reduced after LPS treatment of rats, providing a molecular mechanism for acute-phase suppression of ntcp expression (9.Trauner M. Arrese M. Lee H. Boyer J.L. Karpen S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2092-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). However, it was not known whether LPS-induced cytokines such as TNF-α or IL-1β would be sufficient to suppress nuclear levels ofntcp or mrp2 transactivators and associated gene promoter activity or whether additional inflammatory mediators were also contributing in vivo. The identity of the protein(s), which comprise the ntcptransactivator, FpB BP, has been under investigation. Analysis of thentcp FpB BP-response element, (5′-GGGGCAtaAGGTTA-3′) (nt −53/−40), demonstrates homology to a retinoid x receptor:retinoid α receptor (RXR:RAR) consensus element (Table I) (14.Karpen S.J.

Recent reports have suggested that some nuclear hormone receptors, including RXR, and their respective target genes are suppressed by endotoxin and associated cytokines at the transcriptional level (26.Kuno H.

However, little is known of retinoid regulation of hepatobiliary transport, and more specifically it was not known whether retinoids would be involved in the regulation of ntcp and mrp2 gene expression. We hypothesized that suppression of ntcp and mrp2 by cytokines might occur via suppression of retinoid transactivators, including RXRα and RARα.Table IEMSA OligonucleotidesSequenceAP-1consensus; 5′-CGCTTGATGACTCAG3′NF-κBconsensus; 5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′HNF1ntcp nt−11/+8; 5′-TGCTGGTTAATCTTTTATTT-3′FpCntcp nt −81/−62; 5′-CAGGAAAC TTGAGCAA GGTA-3′C/EBPconsensus; 5′-TGCAGA TTGCGCAA TCTGCA-3′FpBntcp nt −56/−37; 5′-TCC GGGGCA TA AGGTTA TGG-3′DR2consensus; 5′-GCTTCA AGGTCA CC AGGTCA GAGAG-3′FM1ntcp nt −56/−37; 5′-TCC GGttaA TA AGtggA TGG-3′MRP2422mrp2 nt −422/ −398; 5′-GGGTATT TAACAT CTCTG TGAACT C-3′DR5consensus; 5′-GCTTC AGGTCA CCAGG AGGTCA GAGAG-3′ Open table in a new tab In this study, we identify FpB BP as a RXRα:RARα heterodimer and characterize RXRα:RARα-response elements within the ratntcp and mrp2 gene promoters. These response elements mediate induction by retinoids and suppression by IL-1β of gene expression. In addition, an adjacent binding site for CAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBP) is shown to modulate RXRα:RARα transactivation of the ntcp promoter. A proposed molecular mechanism of ntcp and mrp2acute phase transcriptional suppression via IL-1β-induced reduction in the concentration of nuclear RXRα:RARα heterodimers is described. These mechanisms likely contribute to the reduction in transcription of these two genes during the acute phase response. Cell culture medium was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc.

Nature. 1996; 383: 728-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1467) Google Scholar). HepG2 human hepatoma cells were plated in either 12-well plates (105 cells/well) for transient transfections or 10-cm plates (106 cells/plate) for isolation of nuclear extracts. Cells were maintained in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin-streptomycin-glutamine. Plasmids containing rat ntcppromoter sequences −6kb/+47, −1237/+47, and −158/+47 inserted into the luciferase vector pSVoAL were used as the standard ntcppromoter test plasmids, p-6kbntcpLUC, p-1237ntcpLUC, and p-158ntcpLUC, as previously reported (14.Karpen S.J.

A plasmid containing the mrp2promoter sequence from −1044/−15, p-1044mrp2LUC, was created by subcloning an insert generated by polymerase chain reaction from rat genomic DNA into pSVoAL. It should be noted that the sequence of the resulting insert was different from the published sequence at nt −115, with a G in lieu of an A (16.Kauffmann H.M. Schrenk D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This sequence was confirmed from multiple independent polymerase chain reactions using separate preparations of rat genomic DNA template. Rat ntcp andmrp2 constructs, including 5′-deletion plasmids and internal mutations of the FpB and Footprint C (FpC) elements, were constructed as described previously (14.Karpen S.J. Sun A.Q.

Five copies of the ntcp FpB element were inserted upstream of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter to create p5xFpBTKLuc. All sequences were verified by automated sequencing (Keck Biotechnology Center, Yale University). HepG2 cells were grown to 50% confluency prior to transfection with luciferase reporter plasmids utilizing the calcium phosphate:DNA coprecipitation technique as previously reported, with the exception of a 16-h calcium-DNA exposure and no glycerol shock (14.Karpen S.J.

P-Rous sarcoma virus-βGal was used as an internal control for transfection efficiency. After transfection, retinoids or cytokines were added to serum-free medium for treatment of cells for 4–24 h (28.Mackiewicz A. Speroff T. Ganapathi M.K. Kushner I. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 3032-3037PubMed Google Scholar). For nuclear hormone treatments, HepG2 cells were cotransfected with ntcp or mrp2 promoter reporter plasmids and RARα, RXRα, or PPARα expression plasmids together with their respective ligands. After exposure, cells were harvested, and cytoplasmic extracts were assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities according to the manufacturer's directions. Transfections and retinoid or cytokine treatments were performed in triplicate at least twice. LDH release and the degree of apoptosis in control and treated cells were determined utilizing a colormetric LDH release assay and the TACS™ DNA apoptotic laddering kit, respectively. Cell number and trypan blue exclusion were determined for control and treated cells. HepG2 cells were also plated on 10-cm plates until reaching approximately 50% confluency. They were then treated with optimal doses of cytokines (as indicated by functional promoter assays) for times ranging from 4 to 24 h, and nuclear extracts were obtained. Liver nuclei were prepared from control and cytokine- or retinoid-treated cells or control rats at the given time points according to published methods (9.Trauner M. Arrese M. Lee H. Boyer J.L. Karpen S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2092-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad Bradford reagent kit. Nuclear hormone receptors were also synthesized utilizing the TNTTM kit with the respective T7 promoter-driven expression plasmids. The DNA sequence of the sense strand of each oligonucleotide is listed in Table I. Oligonucleotide probes (1 pmol/μl) were end-labeled using 50 μCi of [γ-32P]adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) and 1 μl of polynucleotide kinase T4. Five μg of nuclear extracts or four μl of in vitro synthesized proteins were incubated with 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC) in a 20-μl reaction containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol on ice for 10 min. 2.5 × 104 cpm of 32P-end-labeled oligonucleotide (Table I) were added, and the binding reaction was allowed to proceed on ice for a total of 30 min. In competition assays, 10–100-fold molar excess of the specific unlabeled oligonucleotide was added to the binding mixtures along with the labeled oligonucleotide. In supershift studies for RXRα or RARα, nuclear extracts were incubated with 1 μl (2 mg/ml) of the relevant antibody for 2 h on ice prior to the addition of the radiolabeled probe. In supershift studies for C/EBP, nuclear extracts were incubated with 1 μl (1 mg/ml) of the relevant polyclonal antibody for 1 h on ice subsequent to the addition of the radiolabeled probe. The entire sample was then electrophoresed through a nondenaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel in 0.25 × Tris borate-EDTA buffer at 12 V/cm for 2 h. Data were expressed as the mean ± S.D. or the mean ± S.E. of experiments with at least three independent transfections or treated HepG2 cells/group. Differences among experimental groups were analyzed by the unpaired ttest. ntcp and mrp2 promoter constructs were transactivated by cotransfection of RXRα and RARα expression plasmids activated by the specific ligands LG364 and TTNPB.ntcp promoter activity was increased 17-fold by combined treatment, with less activation by the individual receptors (Fig.1 A). Treatments with ligands alone or unactivated receptors had no significant effect onntcp promoter activity (data not shown). The ntcp−36/+47 construct was not activated by retinoids, placing the retinoid-response element between −158/−36. This region of the promoter includes the previously described FpB (nt −56/−37) and FpC (nt −81/−62) elements, which contribute to basal activity in hepatocytes (14.Karpen S.J. Sun A.Q. Kudish B. Hagenbuch B. Meier P.J. Ananthanarayanan M. Suchy F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15211-15221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Investigations into the identity of the FpB- and FpC-binding proteins and their transactivation by retinoids will be described below. The rat mrp2 promoter full-length construct (p-1044mrp2Luc) was up-regulated by ligand activation of cotransfected RXRα and RARα expression plasmids. Treatment of a series of 5′-deletion constructs localized the retinoid-response element betweenmrp2 nt −422/−398 (Fig. 1 B). This element includes the sequence 5′-GGGTATTTAACATCTCTGTGAACTC-3′, which contains a putative direct repeat (DR5)-response element on the antisense strand (underlined). Treatment with PPARα activated by WY16143 ± ligand-activated RXRα had no effect on activities of either ntcp or mrp2 promoters. These data indicate that the ntcp and mrp2 promoters contain retinoid-response elements and are up-regulated by ligand-activated RXRα:RARα heterodimers. The FpB element contains a putative DR2 retinoid-response element. We then examined whether mutations within the ntcp FpB element affected RXR:RAR activation (Fig.2). Three bp mutations within each hexad of the element eliminated activation by RXRα:RARα (wild-type: 5′-GGGGCATAAGGTTA-3′ to FM1: 5′-GGttaATAAGtggA-3′). A 3-bp mutation within the 3′-hexad alone (FM4: 5′-GGGGCATAAGtggA-3′) also eliminated retinoid activation. A series of 1–4-bp mutations consistently attenuated activation by RXRα and RARα (FM3, FM5, FM10, FM11, and FM13). These included two single bp mutations, which disrupted the 3′-hexad (FM5 and FM11), and a single bp insertion, which increased the interhexad nucleotide spacing from DR2 to DR3 (FM10). By comparision, a 3-bp mutation (FM2) immediately downstream of the DR2 element did not affect activation by retinoids. These data indicate that an intact DR2 element is required to fully mediate retinoid activation of the ntcp promoter. To confirm that the FpB element was sufficient to mediate promoter activation by retinoids, HepG2 cells were transfected with a construct containing multiple copies of the FpB-response element inserted upstream of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (TK) promoter (p-5xFpBTKLuc). The vector plasmid pTKLUC was suppressed by retinoids, whereas p-5xFpBTKLuc was activated ≈18-fold by ligand-activated RXRα and RARα (Fig.3). Moreover, it was important to determine if a CCAAT element in the herpes simplex virus TK promoter would mediate TK promoter activation via C/EBP, because subsequent experiments identified the FpC-binding protein as C/EBP and demonstrated that this element modulates retinoid activation ofntcp (29.Nehls M.C. Rippe R.A. Veloz L. Brenner D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4065-4073Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar, 31.Zeleznik-Le N.J. Azizkhan J.C. Ting J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1873-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Cotransfection of C/EBPα did not activate the pTKLUC construct, whereas a control 3xC/EBPLuc construct was up-regulated 50-fold, arguing against the possibility that a functional C/EBP element exists in the TK promoter (data not shown). Thus, the retinoid activation observed for the p5xFpBTKLuc construct is likely due solely to the FpB element, without a contribution from the CCAAT element in pTKLUC. The ntcpFpC element (nt −81/−62) bears homology to a C/EBP site and is adjacent to the RXR:RAR binding site. Because C/EBP has been shown to cooperate with nuclear hormone receptors in activating at least one other hepatic gene promoter, studies were then performed to determine if the previously identified ntcp FpC element was indeed a C/EBP element (35.Park E.A. Song S.L. Olive M. Roesler W.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The −158/+47 ntcp promoter was activated 5-fold by cotransfected C/EBPα, whereas a mutation in FpC (FM14) essentially eliminated C/EBPα transactivation (Fig.4 A). The predominant basal C/EBP isoform in liver is C/EBPα, whereas C/EBPβ is induced in the acute phase response (32.Diehl A.M. Yang S.Q. Hepatology. 1994; 19: 447-456PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Diehl A.M. Michaelson P. Yang S.Q. Gastroenterology. 1994; 106: 1625-1637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 34.Diehl A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30843-30846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of C/EBPβ uponntcp expression, increasing amounts of C/EBPβ were cotransfected with a fixed amount of C/EBPα. Increasing amounts of C/EBPβ led to a dose-dependent decrease inntcp promoter activity (Fig. 4 A). EMSA using radiolabeled FpC oligonucleotide and rat liver nuclear extract revealed three specifically bound complexes (Fig. 4 B). The supershift pattern obtained after coincubation with C/EBPα and/or C/EBPβ antibodies indicated that these complexes were comprised of C/EBPα and C/EBPβ homodimers and a C/EBPα:C/EBPβ heterodimer, confirming that in native liver FpC is bound predominately by C/EBP proteins. Interestingly, the internal mutation, which altered the FpC element (FM14) but retained the FpB element, reduced ntcp promoter activation by retinoids from 17-fold to approximately 7-fold (see Fig.2). Thus, the ntcp FpB element appears to require cooperation from an adjacent C/EBP element for optimal promoter activation by retinoids. Preliminary work in our laboratory indicated that the FpB BP is a multiprotein complex. UV-cross-linking analysis demonstrated bound species of ∼50 and ∼100 kilodaltons (data not shown). Moreover, attempts to clone a FpB BP with yeast one hybrid screening failed to identify a single polypeptide species that bound FpB. To confirm that a RXRα:RARα heterodimer could bind the FpB element, these proteins were synthesized in vitro and then incubated with the radiolabeled FpB oligonucleotide, with the resulting complex examined by EMSA. As shown in Fig.5 A, neither RXRα nor RARα alone bound radiolabeled FpB, whereas coincubation demonstrated a specifically shifted complex. Mutation of FpB to FM1 eliminated binding by RXRα:RARα, whereas a consensus DR2 oligonucleotide provided the same binding pattern as FpB. It is important to note that coexpression of other liver-enriched RXR partners (PPARα and liver X receptor) with RXRα did not form complexes that bound FpB (data not shown). Themrp2 −422/−398 element is homologous to a DR5 element and was also bound by RXRα:RARα. These data confirmed that RXRα:RARα can bind both the ntcp FpB and mrp2nt −422/−398 elements. To examine binding of RXRα:RARα to the ntcp FpB andmrp2 −422/−398 elements in native rat liver nuclei, EMSA was performed utilizing rat liver nuclear extracts. Supershifting antibodies developed against yeast-expressed RXR and RAR proteins were tested against these rat liver nuclear complexes (36.Allegretto E.A. Shevde N. Zou A. Howell S.R. Boehm M.F. Hollis B.W. Pike J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23906-23909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). As shown in Figs. 5 B and 6, the ntcp- andmrp2-shifted complexes migrated with the same mobility as doublets on EMSA. The anti-RARα antibody significantly reduced the intensity of the doublets for both the ntcp andmrp2 elements and demonstrated a modest supershift for themrp2 complex (Fig. 5 B, arrow). The supershift for the mrp2 element was more pronounced when the anti-RXRα and anti-RARα antibodies were coincubated with the nuclear extracts. The anti-RXRα antibody significantly reduced the intensity of themrp2 DR5 complex but did not have a significant effect upon the intensity of the shifted complex for the ntcp DR2 element. This is likely due to the spatial organization of DR2 and DR5 RXR:RAR complexes and their accessibility by these particular antibodies (see “Discussion”). EMSA was then performed utilizing rat liver nuclear proteins to determine if native mammalian receptors bound by the ntcp and mrp2 retinoid elements could be cross-competed by the respective binding sites (Fig.6). Densitometry demonstrated that the unlabeled FpB oligonucleotide at 100-fold excess reducedmrp2422 signal intensity by 80%, whereas themrp2422 oligonucleotide reduced FpB signal intensity by 95%. A 100-fold excess of unlabeled mutated oligonucleotide (FM1) did not compete for binding to the native FpB BP complex. These data demonstrate that the mrp2 DR5 element and thentcp DR2 element could cross-compete for native rat liver-binding proteins. Whether or not a hierarchy exists for relative binding affinities remains to be determined. HepG2 cells were transfected with the p-6kbntcpLUC construct and treated with TNF-α, IL-1β, or IL-6. A time course from 4 to 24 h demonstrated maximal suppression by cytokines at 16 h (data not shown). Rat ntcp promoter-driven luciferase activity was modestly, but reproducibly, reduced in cells treated with either TNF-α (10 ng/ml"

In primary cultures of cerebellar granule neurons, BDNF-induced reduction of TrkB receptors was largely prevented by the addition of specific proteasome inhibitors. HN10 cells, a neuronal cell line that can be readily transfected, also showed a marked down-regulation of cell surface TrkB following BDNF exposure. In addition, we observed that prolonged exposure to nerve growth factor of TrkA-transfected cells did not lead to the down-regulation seen with BDNF and TrkB. TrkA and TrkB chimeric molecules were therefore expressed in HN10 cells and tested for ligand-induced regulation. These experiments led to the conclusion that the motives responsible for down-regulation are contained in the cytoplasmic domain of TrkB, and a short sequence in the juxtamembrane domain of TrkB was identified that confers nerve growth factor-induced down-regulation when inserted into TrkA.

In mammals, they comprise NGF, BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor), NT3 (neurotrophin 3), and NT4/5 (neurotrophin 4/5). Their trophic actions are mainly mediated by tyrosine kinase receptors belonging to the Trk family. Whereas NGF is the ligand for the TrkA receptor, BDNF and NT4/5 are the ligands for TrkB, and NT3 is a promiscuous ligand with some selectivity for TrkC. Binding of a neurotrophin to the appropriate Trk receptor leads to dimerization and transphosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the intracellular domain of the Trk receptor and subsequent activation of cytoplasmic signaling pathways, such as the Ras/Raf/MAP kinase pathway (for review, see Ref.4.Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Neurotrophins and their receptors are also involved in the function of the mature central nervous system, where some of them, in particular BDNF (5.Hofer M. Pagliusi S.R. Hohn A. Leibrock J. Barde Y.-A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2459-2464Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar) and TrkB (6.Klein R. Parada L.F. Coulier F. Barbacid M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3701-3710Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar), are widely expressed. For example, neurotrophins play a role in the modulation of synaptic transmission, including neurotransmitter release, postsynaptic responses to neurotransmitters, and facilitation of long term potentiation (for reviews, see Refs. 7.Berninger B. Poo M.M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 324-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholarand 8.Thoenen H. Science. 1995; 270: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (1721) Google Scholar). These functions are reminiscent of the actions of neurotransmitters, and it is conceivable that the duration of the signal elicited by the neurotrophins, like that of neurotransmitters, may be regulated. Yet comparatively little is known on the regulation of neurotrophin receptors following ligand binding, although a few previous studies have indicated unexpected differences in the duration of signaling elicited by BDNF and NGF. Whereas both stimulate GTP binding to Ras in chick sensory neurons (9.Ng N.F.L. Shooter E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25329-25333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Carter B.D.

Zirrgiebel U. Barde Y.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21751-21757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In cerebellar granule cells, desensitization of Ras signaling by BDNF is accompanied by a disappearance of TrkB-binding sites (10.Carter B.D. Zirrgiebel U. Barde Y.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21751-21757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of TrkB signaling upon BDNF exposure has also been reported in cultures of cortical (11.Knüsel B. Gao H. Okazaki T. Yoshida T. Mori N. Hefti F. Kaplan D.R.

Furthermore, treatment of both striatal and hippocampal cultures for 24 h with BDNF decreased c-Fos induction upon acute BDNF stimulation (13.Frank L. Ventimiglia R. Anderson K. Lindsay R.M.

As the mechanisms underlying the loss of response to BDNF with time are largely unknown, we investigated the regulation of the Trk receptors by their ligands, using both cultured cerebellar granule cells and the neuronal cell line HN10 (14.Lee H.J. Hammond D.N. Large T.H. Roback J.D. Sim J.A Brown D.A. Otten U.H. Wainer B.H. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 1779-1787Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These cells, unlike A293 cells transfected with TrkB (10.Carter B.D. Zirrgiebel U. Barde Y.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21751-21757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), do show a marked down-regulation of TrkB following prolonged stimulation with BDNF, and as they can be readily transfected with cDNA constructs, we could investigate the TrkB domains accounting for its down-regulation by comparison to TrkA. Recombinant human NGF, BDNF, NT3, and NT4/5 produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells or Escherichia coliwere obtained from Genentech Inc. or Regeneron/Amgen Partners. BDNF produced using the vaccinia virus system (15.Götz R. Kolbeck R. Lottspeich F. Barde Y.-A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 745-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) was also used, with identical results. HN10 cells (14.Lee H.J. Hammond D.N. Large T.H. Roback J.D. Sim J.A Brown D.A. Otten U.H. Wainer B.H. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 1779-1787Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were kept in culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cerebellar granule cells were prepared from P6 rats as described (16.Zafra F. Hengerer B. Leibrock J. Thoenen H. Lindholm D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3545-3550Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). Briefly, cerebella were dissected and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mm glucose, 1 mg/ml albumin, 10 mg/ml DNase, and 0.5 mg/ml papain. The cells were dissociated by trituration through a plastic pipette, pelleted at 900 × g for 5 min, and resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were plated at a density of 20 × 106 on 10-cm polyornithine-coated dishes, and the medium was changed after 12 h to a serum-free complete medium (17.Zirrgiebel U. Ohga Y. Carter B. Berninger B. Inagaki N. Thoenen H. Lindholm D. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 2241-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) with or without 20 ng/ml BDNF. Rat TrkA, TrkB, and TrkA/TrkB chimeras cDNAs, without signal peptide sequences, were cloned, using NheI and NotI into pRC CMV AC7 (pAC7), a vector that provides the signal sequence peptide of basal membrane protein 40 (18.Mayer U. Poschl E. Nischt R. Specks U. Pan T.C. Chu M.L. Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Chimeric molecules between TrkA and TrkB were constructed by polymerase chain reaction, using an overlap extension procedure. All constructs were checked by sequencing. For the construction of the chimeras, the following oligodeoxynucleotides were used: TrkA/B, GGAGAAGAAGGACGAAACACCTCTCTCGGTCTATGCTGTGGTG (fusion at TM domain) and CACCACAGCATAGACCGAGAGAGGTGTTTCGTCCTTCTTCTCC (fusion at TM domain); TrkB/A, GACCAAACCAATCGGGAGCATTTTGGGGTCTCTGTGGCTGTG (fusion at TM domain) and CACAGCCACAGAGACCCCAAAATGCTCCCGATTGGTTTGGTC (fusion at TM domain); TrkATM/B, CTCCTCCTAGTGCTCAACAAGTTGGCGAGACATTCCAA (fusion between TM and JM); TrkA/JMB, CTCCTCCTAGTGCTCAACAAGTTGGCGAGACATTCCAA (fusion between TM and JM) and AGCTCCCACTTGAGAATGATGTTGTGTCTCTTGATGTGCT (fusion between TM and JM); TrkA/TKB, GCTCCCTCTTCAGAACGATGTCCTGGCGCTTGATATG (fusion between JM and TK) and AGAACATCCACACACTCCTTCAGGCCTTGGCACAGGC (fusion between TK and CT); TrkA/CTB, ATGTGCACGCGCGGCTGCAGAACTTGGCGAAGGCG (fusion between TK and CT); TrkB/JMA, TGGTGATGCTGCTTCTGCTCAAATGTGGACAGAGGAGCAAAT (fusion between TM and JM) and GCTCCCTCTTCAGAACGATGTCCTGGCGCTTGATATG (fusion between JM and TK). All constructs were expressed in HN10 cells and tested for autophosphorylation by anti-phosphotyrosine blots. The functionality of all constructs was confirmed by assessing their neurite outgrowth promoting activity in nnr5-PC12 cells (19.Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4873) Google Scholar, 20.Green S.H. Rydel R.E. Connolly J.L. Greene L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 830-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Constructs that did not behave similarly to wild-type Trk receptors were excluded from further analysis. TrkATM/B molecules with point mutations to delete the binding sites for Shc (TrkATM/B.delShc), for PLC-γ (TrkA/TMB.delPLC), or for both Shc and PLC-γ (TrkATM/B.delShc-PLC) were also constructed by polymerase chain reaction site-directed mutagenesis. For each construct, deletion of the binding site was achieved by replacement of the tyrosine responsible for binding by a phenylalanine residue. When required, simultaneous introduction of silent mutations was also performed in order to allow for identification of positive clones by restriction analysis. Sequencing of the constructs confirmed the expected sequences. For the construction of these molecules, the following oligodeoxynucleotides were used: TrkATM/B.delShc, TGGCTGTTGGTGATACCGAAGAACTGGGGGTTTTCAATGACAG (replacement of tyrosine at position 499 by phenylalanine; simultaneously a uniqueScaI site was deleted) and CTGTCATTGAAAACCCCCAGTTCTTCGGTATCACCAACAGCCA; TrkATM/B.delPLC, GCTCTAGACTAGCCTAGGATATCCAGGAAGACGGGCGACGCCTTCGCC (replacement of tyrosine at position 794 by phenylalanine; introduction of aEcoRV site). HN10 cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (21.Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar) and incubated overnight at 37 °C in 3% CO2. After a medium change, they were placed in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Five to six hours later, the transfected cells were split equally, kept in culture for at least 12 h, and then treated or not (control) with 100 ng/ml neurotrophin for 24 h. NGF and BDNF were iodinated using lactoperoxidase and 125I (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech IMS30) as described previously (22.Dechant G. Biffo S. Okazawa H. Kolbeck R. Pottgiesser J. Barde Y.-A. Development. 1993; 119: 545-558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Typically, 75–90% of the total radioactivity was incorporated into the protein, and radiolabeled material was used within 10 days. Transfected HN10 cells cultured for 24 h in the absence or presence of neurotrophin were washed intensively with a buffer containing 25 mmHepes, pH 7.5, 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5 mm glucose, 3 mm MgCl2 (KRH) and twice with an acid-wash buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mg/ml albumin, pH 3.0) that has been shown to remove previously bound neurotrophin (data not shown). The cells were then incubated for 2 h on ice with the KRH buffer containing 1 mg/ml albumin and 0.25 nm125I-BDNF or 125I-NGF. The membrane-impermeable cross-linker bis-(sulfosuccinimidyl) sulfate (Pierce) was then added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm, and incubation was continued for 30 min. Unreacted reagent was quenched with Tris buffer (30 mm, pH 8); the plates were rinsed with Tris-buffered saline, and the cells were lysed in a buffer consisting of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100. The plates were scraped and cell debris removed by a 10-min spin at 14,000 × g. Trk receptors in the lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Trk, a polyclonal antiserum raised to a peptide corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of the intracellular domain of TrkA that also immunoprecipitates TrkB and TrkC (23.Schröpel A. von Schack D. Dechant G. Barde Y.A. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1995; 6: 544-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The cross-linking and immunoprecipitation procedures were performed at 4 °C. After washing with a buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol and 0.1% Triton X-100, the immunoprecipitates were denatured by heating to 100 °C for 5 min in Laemmli buffer (63 mmTris, pH 6.8, 15% glycerol, 5% mercaptoethanol, 2.25% SDS, and bromphenol blue 0.1 mg/ml). Following electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE 6%), the gels were dried and detected by exposing overnight to a PhosphorImager plate. Densitometric analysis of the gels was performed using the PhosphorImager Software TINA. Cerebellar granule neurons cultured in the absence or presence of 20 ng/ml BDNF were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed as described above. Lysates were centrifuged, and the supernatants were precipitated with WGA-Sepharose 6MB (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The precipitates were washed, run on 6% SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp.), and incubated with anti-TrkB serum that was raised to a peptide corresponding to amino acids 155–318 in the extracellular domain of TrkB (Transduction Laboratories) or with a pan-Trk antiserum (23.Schröpel A. von Schack D. Dechant G. Barde Y.A. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1995; 6: 544-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Detection was performed with a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and an enhanced chemiluminescence substrate solution (Pierce). Cerebellar granule cells were cultured for 2 h in serum-free medium (17.Zirrgiebel U. Ohga Y. Carter B. Berninger B. Inagaki N. Thoenen H. Lindholm D. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 2241-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) containing the inhibitor at the indicated concentrations. BDNF was then added, and incubation proceeded at 37 °C for 3 h. ALLN, ALLM, and E64 were obtained from Sigma, and lactacystin was purchased from Calbiochem. The neurotrophin receptors TrkB and TrkC, but not TrkA, have been shown to be present in the developing and adult rodent cerebellum (17.Zirrgiebel U. Ohga Y. Carter B. Berninger B. Inagaki N. Thoenen H. Lindholm D. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 2241-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 24.Ernfors P. Merlio J.-P. Persson H. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1992; 4: 1140-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). By Western blot analysis using dissociated P6 cerebellar granule neurons and either anti-Trk antiserum or TrkB-specific antibodies, TrkB was shown to be the predominant receptor type in this system (data not shown). As previously reported (10.Carter B.D. Zirrgiebel U. Barde Y.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21751-21757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), we observed that pre-treatment of cerebellar granule cells with 20 ng/ml BDNF for 24 h resulted in a dramatic reduction of radiolabeled BDNF cross-linked to TrkB (data not shown). To determine if the loss of cell-surface binding was a consequence of decrease in expression levels of TrkB, Western blot analyses of total cell lysates were performed with TrkB-specific antibodies following WGA precipitation. Two major bands with molecular masses of ∼130 and ∼100 kDa were stained by the antibody (Fig.1 A). Since only the upper band reacted with antibodies raised against the carboxyl terminus of Trk (Fig. 1 B), it appears that the upper band corresponds to the full-length form of TrkB, whereas the lower band presumably represents a truncated, kinase-defective, form of TrkB (25.Klein R.

Treatment of the cells with 20 ng/ml BDNF resulted in a marked reduction of the 130-kDa band, while not affecting the 100-kDa band (Fig. 1 A). This marked decrease in the levels of the upper band was also seen after precipitation with Trk-specific antibodies (data not shown) and with antibodies raised against the carboxyl terminus of the receptor in the Western blotting (Fig. 1 B). This finding suggests that the loss of BDNF-binding sites following prolonged exposure of the cells to BDNF is a consequence of down-regulation of the full-length TrkB receptor. The time course of BDNF-induced TrkB down-regulation was then analyzed (Fig. 1 B). Exposure of cells to BDNF for only 1–2 h already reduced the TrkB protein levels to about 50%, and only very low levels of TrkB protein could be detected after 3 h in the presence of BDNF. The rapid onset of down-regulation suggests that BDNF acts at the protein level, rather than reducing the transcription rates of TrkB mRNA. In view of the fact that TrkB is rapidly regulated by its ligands at the protein level, we then tested different inhibitors of proteases or of proteolytic systems for their ability to prevent receptor degradation. From a set of protease inhibitors known to delay protein degradation, inhibitors of the proteasome were found to be most efficient in blocking BDNF-induced down-regulation of TrkB (Fig.2). By comparison with control cells (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2), BDNF-induced down-regulation of full-length TrkB was considerably reduced in the presence of the proteasome inhibitorN-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (ALLN) at a concentration of 10 μm (Fig. 2, lane 3). Since ALLN can also significantly inhibit calpain, we also tested the related inhibitorN-acetyl-Leu-Leu-methional (ALLM), which has the same inhibitory activity toward calpain as ALLN, but a 10-fold lower proteasome blocking activity (26.Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2206) Google Scholar). At identical concentrations, ALLM had almost no effect on TrkB down-regulation (Fig. 2, lane 4). E64, a potent inhibitor of lysosomal cysteine proteases, did not block down-regulation of TrkB at a concentration of 10 μm (Fig. 2, lane 5), excluding that the effect of ALLN is due to its inhibition of this class of enzymes. To confirm the involvement of the proteasome in the down-regulation of TrkB, the specific proteasome inhibitor lactacystin (27.Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1504) Google Scholar) was tested as well. Lactacystin has not been found to block the activity of other proteases including calpain, cathepsin B, chymotrypsin, trypsin, and papain. Similarly to ALLN, lactacystin (8 μm) also prevented down-regulation of TrkB (Fig. 2, lane 6). The effect of these two drugs on TrkB down-regulation was equal whether they were used alone or in combination (Fig. 2, compare lane 7 withlanes 3 and 6). BDNF-induced down-regulation of TrkB seems therefore to involve the proteasome degradation system. As protein degradation by the proteasome proteolytic pathway is typically triggered by the attachment of a multi-ubiquitin chain (28.Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1996; 84: 813-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar,29.Hicke L. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 107-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), we looked for ubiquitinated forms of TrkB in lysates of cerebellar granule cells. However, no clear evidence for TrkB ubiquitination following BDNF could be observed in these cells (see “Discussion”). We used the neuronal cell line HN10 (14.Lee H.J. Hammond D.N. Large T.H. Roback J.D. Sim J.A Brown D.A. Otten U.H. Wainer B.H. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 1779-1787Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to get more information on the structural elements of TrkB required for activation of the degradation machinery. HN10 cells were chosen for these experiments because, in contrast to cerebellar granule cells, they can be efficiently transfected. Following transfection with a wild-type TrkB cDNA, radiolabeled BDNF was cross-linked to HN10 cell surface receptors (Fig. 3). After immunoprecipitation of cell lysates with a Trk-specific antibody, a radioactive band at ∼150 kDa was detected (Fig. 3, lane 6), corresponding to a cross-linked complex between TrkB and radiolabeled BDNF. This band was absent in the cells transfected with an empty vector (Fig. 3, lane 5) or when binding of the radiolabeled neurotrophin was competed for by a 100-fold excess unlabeled BDNF (Fig. 3, lane 7). Immunoprecipitates from TrkB-expressing cells treated for 24 h with 100 ng/ml BDNF revealed a dramatic decrease in receptor cross-linking, suggesting a loss of cell surface-binding sites caused by BDNF treatment (Fig. 3,lane 8). Since previous experiments with primary neuronal cultures had pointed to a differential regulation of signaling by NGF and BDNF (10.Carter B.D. Zirrgiebel U. Barde Y.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21751-21757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that TrkA and TrkB could be differentially regulated by their ligands. We thus transiently transfected HN10 cells with TrkA and cross-linked cell surface receptors with radiolabeled NGF (Fig. 3). In contrast to TrkB-expressing cells treated with BDNF (Fig. 3, lane 8), TrkA-expressing cells retained their ability to bind NGF upon treatment for 24 h with 100 ng/ml NGF (Fig. 3, lane 4). It thus appears that cell surface TrkB is down-regulated by BDNF, unlike TrkA following exposure to NGF. These experiments suggest then that TrkB contains structural motives leading to down-regulation that may be absent in TrkA. To get insight into structural elements accounting for the down-regulation of TrkB, we generated chimeric receptors between TrkA and TrkB (Fig. 4) that were tested for ligand-dependent regulation in HN10 cells. We first tested chimeric receptors consisting of the extracellular domain of one receptor fused to the intracellular domain of the other. When the intracellular domain of TrkB was replaced by the corresponding domain of TrkA, the resulting chimeric receptor (named Trk B/A, see Fig. 4) could bind BDNF (Fig.5 A, lane 5) but was no longer down-regulated by BDNF (Fig. 5 A, lane 6). Conversely, chimeric receptors composed of the extracellular domain of TrkA and the intracellular domain of TrkB (Trk A/B, Fig. 4) bound NGF and were down-regulated following NGF treatment (Fig.5 A, compare lanes 3 and 4). Replacing the intracellular domain of TrkA by that of TrkB was therefore sufficient to cause down-regulation upon NGF stimulation. The transmembrane domain had no role in this effect, since receptors containing the extracellular domain of TrkA and the intracellular domain of TrkB with the transmembrane domain of either TrkA (TrkATM/B, Fig. 4) or TrkB (TrkA/B, Fig. 4) down-regulated equally in response to NGF (Fig. 5 A, compare lanes 3 and 4 with lanes 1 and 2 inright panel). These results show that the intracellular part of TrkB contains a motif conferring ligand-dependent down-regulation to TrkA. Furthermore, this experiment indicates that the differential regulation for TrkA and TrkB is not due to properties related to the extracellular domain of the receptors or to the neurotrophins, such as binding affinity, kinetics, or stability of the ligand. The cytoplasmic sequences of TrkB causing down-regulation were further investigated by swapping smaller domains of the intracellular part of TrkB into the TrkA backbone. The following TrkA chimeric receptors were constructed (Fig. 4): TrkA/JMB, in which the juxtamembrane domain of TrkA (a sequence of ∼80 amino acids between the transmembrane and the tyrosine kinase domains) was replaced by the corresponding domain of TrkB; TrkA/TKB, containing the tyrosine kinase domain of TrkB (∼230 amino acids) fused to the juxtamembrane and the carboxyl-terminal domains of TrkA; and TrkA/CTB, in which the carboxyl terminus of TrkA (a sequence of ∼15 amino acids downstream of the tyrosine kinase domain) was replaced by that of TrkB. The cDNAs encoding for these molecules were transfected into HN10 cells, and the resulting receptors were tested for NGF-induced down-regulation (Fig.6 A, left panel). Replacement of the juxtamembrane domain of TrkA with the corresponding domain of TrkB resulted in a receptor (TrkA/JMB) that could be down-regulated by NGF (Fig. 6 A, left panel, lanes 1 and2). In contrast, replacement of the tyrosine kinase domain of TrkA by that of TrkB (TrkA/TKB) could not transfer the potential for down-regulation to TrkA (Fig. 6 A, left panel, lanes 3 and4). Whereas in some experiments, the carboxyl-terminal domain of TrkB seemed to confer a modest down-regulation to TrkA (TrkA/CTB, see Fig. 6 A, lanes 5 and 6), the result was not consistent as indicated by the quantification of the results of several experiments (Fig. 6 B). If the juxtamembrane domain of TrkB would be the only significant motif accounting for the differential behavior of TrkA and TrkB, it would be expected that replacement of this domain in TrkB by the corresponding domain of TrkA would result in a TrkB molecule (TrkB/JMA) that does not down-regulate. However, TrkB/JMA still showed ligand-induced down-regulation (Fig. 6 A, right panel, lanes 3 and 4). This suggests that the juxtamembrane domain of TrkB is sufficient, although not necessary, for receptor down-regulation. Since the juxtamembrane and the carboxyl-terminal domains of TrkB contain the binding sites for Shc and PLC-γ, respectively, we next tested whether the activation of the signaling pathways elicited by the phosphorylation of these substrates could be involved in TrkB down-regulation. By using the TrkATM/B backbone (Fig. 4), a molecule that binds NGF and is down-regulated by its ligand just like TrkB (see Fig.5 A), we introduced point mutations to inactivate the binding sites for Shc, PLC-γ, or both simultaneously, by replacing tyrosines 499 and 794, respectively, by phenylalanine residues (Fig. 4). As Fig.7 A shows, abolishment of binding of the Trk receptor to either Shc, PLC-γ, or to both did not interfere with the capability of the receptor to down-regulate. Regulatory domains acting independently of the Shc and of the PLC-γ signaling pathways seem therefore to be responsible for TrkB down-regulation. The results obtained with the chimeric and mutant receptors cons"

We have used three different effector-loop mutant forms of Ras, each of which activates a single downstream effector pathway, to dissect their individual contributions to survival of nerve growth factor (NGF)-dependent sympathetic neurons. The PI3-kinase pathway-selective protein RasVal-12Y40C was as powerful as oncogenic RasVal-12 in preventing apoptosis induced by NGF deprivation but conferred no protection against apoptosis induced by cytosine arabinoside. Identical results were obtained with transfected Akt. In contrast, the ERK pathway-selective protein RasVal-12T35S had no protective effects on NGF-deprived neurons but was almost as strongly protective as RasVal-12 against cytosine arabinoside-induced apoptosis. The protective effects of RasVal-12T35S against cytosine arabinoside were completely abolished by the ERK pathway inhibitor PD98059. RasVal-12E37G, an activator of RalGDS, had no survival effect on either death pathway, similar to RasS17N, the full survival antagonist.

However, the mechanisms used by Ras to protect the neurons from apoptosis are not yet fully understood.

In contrast, whereas p42 and p44 mitogen-activated protein kinases (ERKs), which mediate the Ras/Raf-1 pathway, are strongly and persistently activated by NGF (13.Virdee K. Tolkovsky A.M. Eur. J.

In PC12 cells its overexpression inhibited neurite outgrowth induced by NGF suggesting a dominant-negative effect (16.Goi T. Rusanescu G. Urano T. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell.

Recently, we uncovered a putative role for ERK activity in SCG neuron survival by demonstrating that the MEK inhibitor PD98059, which abolishes ERK activity (14.Creedon D.J. Johnson Jr., E.M.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 664-673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These experiments raised the possibility that besides the Ras/PI3K pathway, the Ras/ERK pathway might also protect against apoptosis of NGF-deprived neurons. There is great interest in understanding the role of the Ras/ERKs pathway in survival since it is becoming increasingly clear that there exist PI3K/Akt-independent survival signaling pathways and that PI3K/Akt activity induced by some cytokines is not being utilized for survival (18.Kulik G. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6711-6718Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 19.Carson J.P. Kulik G. Webe M.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1449-1453PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Scheid M.P. Duronio V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7439-7444Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), although the identity of the alternative survival signals was not determined. However one study (20.Scheid M.P. Duronio V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7439-7444Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) excluded ERK activity from being the alternative pathway mediating Akt-independent survival. In PC12 cells it was suggested that ERKs promoted survival by inhibiting c-Jun N-terminal kinase/p38 stress kinases (21.Xia Z.G. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5045) Google Scholar), but in SCG neurons we found no obligate relationship between the two processes (13.Virdee K. Tolkovsky A.M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 2159-2169Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In cardiomyocytes ERK activity was induced by oxidative stress and was shown to limit damage by inducing cyclooxygenase-2 expression and production of prostacyclin (22.Adderley S.B. Fitzgerald D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5038-5046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), but the relationship to apoptosis was not clear. Moreover, ERK activity is not induced by oxidative signals in SCG neurons. The role of the Ras/ERK signaling pathway in suppression of apoptosis thus remains largely unresolved. In this study we investigate the relative importance of each of the signal pathways downstream of p21Ras to determine whether these pathways are synergistic in protection against apoptosis, whether there are limits to protection by the PI3K pathway, and whether there are circumstances in which the ERK pathway might play a predominant role in survival. To this end, we have studied the effects of three different effector-loop domain point mutants of Ha-Ras(G12V) (RasVal-12) which interact with different single effectors in mammalian cells (4.White M.A. Vale T.

Ras(G12V,T35S) (RasVal-1235S) binds to Raf-1 and activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway with about 20% efficiency of RasVal-12 (7.RodriguezViciana P. Warne P.H. Khwaja A. Marte B.M. Pappin D. Das P. Waterfield M.D. Ridley A. Downward J. Cell. 1997; 89: 457-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). It shows no interaction with PI3-kinase p110α subunit but interacts with RalGDS very slightly; Ras(G12V,E37G) (RasVal-12E37G) binds to RalGDS but not to Raf-1 or p110α; Ras(G12V,Y40C) (RasVal-1240C) binds and activates PI3-kinase p110α but not Raf-1 or RalGDS. Previously it was suggested that RasVal-1240C but not RasVal-1235S suppresses c-Myc-induced apoptosis in fibroblasts (23.KauffmanZeh A. RodriguezViciana P. Ulrich E. Gilbert C. Coffer P. Downward J. Evan G. Nature. 1997; 385: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). By using these constructs, we demonstrate that RasVal-1240C is as efficient as RasVal-12 in protecting against the death of NGF-deprived neurons. In contrast, only RasVal-1235S could protect against apoptosis induced by araC, the Ras/PI3K pathway playing no role in this protection. These results were corroborated using active Akt and the ERK pathway inhibitor PD98059. The RalGDS-selective proteins RasVal-12E37G had no protective effects. Thus unlike cycling cells where the three Ras pathways are synergistic for transformation (5.White M.A. Nicolette C. Minden A. Polverino A. Aelst L.V. Karin M. Wigler M.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 533-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar), in sympathetic neurons the two Ras downstream pathways that are implicated in survival are neither additive nor synergistic. Rather, they function as independent mechanisms to support neuron survival by suppressing two different mechanisms of apoptotic induction.

Monoclonal antibodies to hemagglutinin (HA) and c-Myc were from Babco. Antibody to active ERK was from Promega and antibody to phospho-Akt was from New England Biolabs. Anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Cy3 was from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. Cytosine arabinoside (araC) and Hoechst 33342 were from Sigma. PD98059 was purchased from Calbiochem. Superior cervical ganglia (SCG) were dissected from 1-day-old rat pups, and sympathetic neurons were extracted as described previously (13.Virdee K. Tolkovsky A.M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 2159-2169Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, SCG were digested for 40 min at 37 °C in 0.1% trypsin, and a single-cell suspension was obtained by triturating the digested ganglia through a narrow-bore flame-polished Pasteur pipette. To purify the neurons, cells were preplated twice for about 1 h each onto collagen-coated culture dishes in L15-CO2 medium containing 5% rat serum under 5% CO2, 37 °C, and nonadhering neurons were collected by centrifugation. HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mml-glutamine, penicillin (100,100 IU/ml), and streptomycin (100,100 UG/ml) in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Transfection was carried out following the protocol from Life Technologies, Inc., with some modifications. Briefly, newly isolated neurons were plated onto poly-l-lysine/laminin-coated glass coverslips in 24-well plates and cultured for 3 h in L15-CO2 medium containing 3% rat serum and 20 ng/ml NGF. After one wash with serum-free medium without antibiotics, the cells were incubated for 4 h in the same medium containing 3 μl of LipofectAMINE and 0.15 pmol of plasmid DNA per well. Transfections were terminated by replacing the transfection mixture with the culture medium. After 36 h of transfection, cells were washed twice with medium lacking NGF and incubated in the same medium for 20 h in the presence or absence of NGF and/or 1 mm araC. In some cases, 80 μm PD98059 was added. HeLa cells were passaged 1 day before transfection and transfected using the same protocol used for neurons. After 1 day of expression, the cells were washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, serum-starved for 20 h to remove endogenous signaling through Ras, and then lysed for Western blot analysis. SCG neurons were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. After three washes with PBS, the cells were permeabilized in PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.1% saponin followed by 1 h incubation with primary mouse antibodies to the appropriate tag (anti-c-Myc or -HA). Cells were then stained with Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse IgG for 1 h and washed twice in PBS/BSA/saponin and once in the same buffer containing Hoechst 33342. The coverslips were mounted in Vectashield (Vector). Expression of mutant Ras and apoptosis in the transfected population were determined by direct visual counting under a fluorescence microscope. The scores from the entire cohort of transfected neurons (4–6 coverslips) were pooled to represent one independent experiment, which was repeated between 2 and 6 times. To determine the amount of apoptosis in the total population of neurons for each treatment (labeled Total in Figs. 4 and Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8), random fields of neurons from each well (1000–1500 cells per well) were scored for apoptosis using Hoechst, and the results were pooled to give a single value per experiment. Figs. 4 and 6 show the total percentage of survival obtained after each treatment and also the difference in percentage survival between the total population of NGF-deprived or araC-treated neurons (set to 0) and each of the other treatments or transfections. Statistical comparisons were performed using two-tailed Student's t test.Figure 8m/p-Akt fails to support the survival of araC-treated SCG neurons. A, HeLa cells were transfected with m/p Akt for 1 day and then serum-starved for 20 h, and extracts were prepared to examine gene expression and kinase activities by Western blotting using antibodies to HA tag, phospho-Akt, and active ERKs. A strong band around 62 kDa is recognized by the anti-HA antibody (left panel). The overexpressed m/p-Akt strongly enhanced Akt phosphorylation but had no effect on Erk activity (right panel). B, SCG neurons were transfected with m/p-Akt. After 36 h, the neurons were washed and treated with normal growth medium, or NGF-deprived, or exposed to 1 mmaraC in the absence of NGF for 20 h as indicated. 200–2000 transfected neurons were counted per treatment. m/p-Akt significantly reduced the death of NGF-deprived neurons but showed no protection against araC-induced apoptosis. Data correspond to the mean of three independent experiments; the error bars are standard deviations (p < 0.01 +NGF/total versus−NGF/total not significant, +NGF/Akt versus −NGF/Akt;p > 0.05 −NGF+araC/total versus−NGF+araC/Akt).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 6Quantitative analysis of survival or apoptosis of neurons expressing various Ras mutant proteins treated with araC in the presence or absence of NGF.

A, compared with the neuronal survival in the normal medium (+ NGF,left-hand side), araC (+NGF+ araC,right-hand side) caused about 25–35% reduction of neuronal survival in the total, RasVal-12-, or RasVal-1240C-expressing neurons but not in RasVal-1235S-expressing neurons (p < 0.01 +NGF versus +NGF+araC/total/12V/40C/35S; not significant, +NGF+araC/total versus +NGF+araC/12V/40C/35S).

The lysates were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with antibodies as indicated under “Results.” The intensity of protein bands was quantified using a Leica Q500 Quantimet image analysis system. Newly isolated rat sympathetic neurons were transfected with five different mutant forms of human Ha-Ras as follows: RasVal-12, which is constitutively active but nonselective; RasVal-1235S, which couples almost exclusively to the Raf/ERK pathway; RasVal-1240C, which couples exclusively to the PI3K pathway; RasVal-1237G, which couples to RalGDS; and Ras17N, which is dominant-negative. Since the number of transfected sympathetic neurons was not high enough for a biochemical analysis by Western blotting, we first examined the fidelity of gene expression and pathway coupling of our constructs by using transfected HeLa cells (Fig. 1). Antibodies detecting either the c-Myc or HA tag epitopes fused to the N termini of the various Ras mutant proteins recognized two major bands of around 25 kDa in the transfected cells but not in control cells (Fig. 1, A and B). The lower bandsrepresent the mature post-translationally modified form of the transfected Ras proteins, and the upper bands consist of the unmodified forms of transfected Ras that can accumulate during overexpression. 2A. Hall, personal communication. To confirm the specificity of the various mutated forms of Ras for the signaling pathways, we probed the HeLa cell samples with antibodies to active phospho-ERKs, which are downstream of Raf-1, and phospho-Akt, which is downstream of PI3K. Fig. 1 C shows that RasVal-12strongly enhanced phosphorylation of both Akt and ERKs in the transfected HeLa cells; RasVal-1235S only increased ERK phosphorylation whereas RasVal-1240C only increased Akt phosphorylation thus confirming the lack of cross-reactivity between the signals induced by the two loop effector mutants. Neither Ras17N nor RasVal-1237G had any activatory effect on either kinase, confirming that these mutants do not activate either pathway. To assess the contribution of the various Ras effector pathways to neuronal survival, we scored the number of living and apoptotic neurons expressing different forms of Ras by fluorescence microscopy after staining with the DNA dye Hoechst 33342. Expression of the transfected Ras proteins was revealed by immunocytochemical staining of the c-Myc or HA tags. The extent of survival of Ras-overexpressing neurons was compared with that of the total population of cells in the same samples. As shown in Fig. 2 (a, c, e, g, and i), all the different forms of tagged Ras proteins were localized primarily to the plasma membrane, as expected of the mature protein, although there was also staining in the Golgi region, where the pre-processed form of Ras is accumulated. Staining was distributed in both neurosoma and neurites. Since these neurons were transfected prior to neurite outgrowth, Ras proteins must have been exported into the growing neurites, presumably by being included within membrane vesicles that provide neurite precursor building blocks. During the initial stages of apoptosis, neurites were collapsed, and Ras staining in the fragmented neurites was usually seen as small dots around the neurosoma (Fig. 2 c, lower neuron). Occasionally, overexpression of Ras proteins caused nuclear deformation that showed a crescentic or lobulated pattern of nuclei containing uncondensed DNA masses (Fig. 2 d, upper neuron). Deformation seemed to be due to the abundance of protein accumulated in the Golgi prior to export. When these neurons had healthy neurites they were scored as surviving cells. Expression of RasVal-12 and Ras17N confirmed our previous results using trituration of proteins that demonstrated the critical function of Ras signaling in SCG neuron survival (1.Nobes C.D. Buckmaster A.E. Tolkovsky A.M. J. Auton. Nerv. Syst. 1991; 33: 213-214Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 2.Nobes C.D. Tolkovsky A.M. Eur. J.

Overexpression of RasVal-12 had no deleterious effects on neurons maintained in the presence of NGF (Fig. 3,a and b; Fig. 4) (survival of RasVal-12-positive cells 91 ± 2.6% compared with 95.4 ± 0.6% in the total population) and completely blocked apoptosis induced by 20 h of NGF deprivation (survival of RasVal-12-positive cells 87 ± 4% compared with 69 ± 3.5% in the total population of neurons,p < 0.001 −NGF/total versus−NGF/RasVal-12). Most RasVal-12-expressing cells showed a healthy profile with robust neurites despite the absence of NGF (compare Figs. 2 a and 3 a). In contrast, Ras17N caused massive neuronal apoptosis in the presence of NGF (survival being reduced from 96 ± 0.6 to 41 ± 7.6%), there being a significant increase (by 28%; p < 0.005) in the percentage of cells with apoptotic nuclei compared with the value measured in the total population of NGF-deprived neurons (Fig. 2,c and d; Fig. 4). Little further apoptosis was observed in the Ras17N-expressing neurons that were also NGF-deprived (35 ± 3.3% survival) thus supporting the idea that Ras17N is only dominant-negative in the context of a counter-signal induced by NGF. Thus, most of the apoptosis that occurred in Ras17N-expressing neurons occurred prior to NGF deprivation. Furthermore, no proper neurite outgrowth could be observed in the Ras17N-positive neurons maintained in the presence of NGF (Fig. 2 c). Thus, constitutively active transfected RasVal-12 is sufficient to support neuron survival and rescue neurons from NGF deprivation, whereas dominant inactive Ras17N kills neurons by completely blocking survival signaling from NGF, implying that Ras activity is necessary for NGF-mediated survival. To examine which of the downstream pathways of Ras contribute to rescue from NGF withdrawal, SCG neurons were deprived of NGF after transfection with specific effector-loop domain mutant Ras constructs. In the absence of NGF, expression of RasVal-1240C (which activates the PI3K pathway) completely inhibited neuronal death induced by 20 h of NGF withdrawal (91.3 ± 1.1% survival, Fig. 4; p < 0.001 compared with −NGF/total) and did not reduce survival in the presence of NGF (93 ± 0.9%). Furthermore, RasVal-1240C (like RasVal-12) promoted effusive outgrowth of healthy and long neurites in both presence or absence of NGF (Figs. 2 g and 3 e). Thus, the activity of the Ras-linked PI3K pathway fully blocks the apoptotic signal and is sufficient for supporting neuronal survival in the absence of a neurotrophic factor. In contrast to RasVal-1240C, RasVal-1235S expression (which activates the Raf-1/ERK pathway) did not block neuronal death during NGF deprivation, the rate of survival of RasVal-1235S-positive cells (60 ± 5%) being similar to that of NGF-deprived cells in the total population (69 ± 3.5%) (Figs. 3, c and d and Fig. 4). In the presence of NGF, RasVal-1235S-overexpressing neurons underwent as much apoptosis (69 ± 2.4% survival) as the NGF-deprived neurons, suggesting that it may have some dominant-negative effects when the NGF survival signaling is active. Compared with RasVal-12-positive neurons, surviving RasVal-1235S-positive cells exhibited a thinner and less dense profile of neurites (Fig. 2, a and e, and Fig. 3, a and c). Thus the Ras/ERK pathway does not appear to deliver a protective signal against NGF withdrawal-induced neuronal death. To address the function of RalGDS pathway, RasVal-1237G was expressed in SCG neurons. As shown in Fig. 2 i,RasVal-1237G seemed to suppress neurite outgrowth in the presence of NGF, and many expressing cells did not display HA-stained neurites. In addition, a low proportion of survival (64 ± 3%) was scored in RasVal-1237G-positive neurons in the presence of NGF (Fig. 4) suggesting a slight dominant-negative effect of RasVal-1237G on neuronal survival signals. This interpretation was supported by the lack of further reduction in survival (57 ± 7%) when neurons were deprived of NGF for 20 h. Treatment with 1 mm araC can induce sympathetic neuron apoptosis in the presence of NGF as efficiently as NGF deprivation (24.Wallace T.L. Johnson E.M. J. Neur"
https://openalex.org/W2318152721,"The ATM protein kinase is a critical intermediate in a number of cellular responses to ionizing irradiation (IR) and possibly other stresses. ATM dysfunction results in abnormal checkpoint responses in multiple phases of the cell cycle, including G1, S and G2. Though downstream targets of the ATM kinase are still being elucidated, it has been demonstrated that ATM acts upstream of p53 in a signal transduction pathway initiated by IR and can phosphorylate p53 at serine 15. The cell cycle stage-specificity of ATM activation and p53Ser15 phosphorylation was investigated in normal lymphoblastoid cell line (GM536). Ionizing radiation was found to enhance the kinase activity of ATM in all phases of the cell cycle. This enhanced activity was apparent immediately after treatment of cells with IR, but was not accompanied by a change in the abundance of the ATM protein. Since IR activates the ATM kinase in all phases of the cell cycle, DNA replication-dependent strand breaks are not required for this activation. Further, since p53 protein is not directly required for IR-induced S and G2-phase checkpoints, the ATM kinase likely has different functional targets in different phases of the cell cycle. These observations indicate that the ATM kinase is necessary primarily for the immediate response to DNA damage incurred in all phases of the cell cycle."

Analysis of metabolically labeled cells revealed that Drm exists in secreted and cell-associated forms that exhibit similar mobilities in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein analysis indicated that Drm is present in two major species: a slow migrating glycosylated form and a nonglycosylated form. Both forms of Drm are able to undergo phosphorylation. Drm is released into the media within 30 min of synthesis and is detectable for up to 4–5 h, whereas the cell-associated form has a half-life of about 1 h. Confocal immunofluorescent microscopy indicates that Drm is present both on the external surface of expressing cells, as well as within the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi. Both glycosylated and nonglycosylated forms of Drm exhibit identical distributions and are able to antagonize bone morphogenetic protein signaling.

Drm was identified on the basis of its high level of expression in nontransformed fibroblasts and the loss of expression following transformation by a variety of viral oncogenes, including v-mos, v-raf, and v-ras.

Interestingly, the Xenopus homolog of drm, designated Gremlin, was isolated during a screen for proteins, which would act on Xenopus explants as dorsalizing factors (11.Hsu D.R. Economides A.N.

Consistent with this hypothesis, Drm/Gremlin has recently been reported to function in limb bud development in both mouse (27.Zuniga A. Haramis A.P. McMahon A.P. Zeller R. Nature. 1999; 401: 598-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) and chicken (28.Merino R. Rodrigues-Leon J. Macias D. Ganan Y. Economides A.N. Hurle Y.M. Development. 1999; 126: 5515-5522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in addition to its possible role as a regulator of early development, our previous results indicated that Drm expression is highly regulated in various adult rat tissues and is particularly expressed in terminally differentiated cells (1.Topol L.Z. Marx M Laugier D. Bogdanova N.N. Boubnov N.V. Clausen P.A. Calothy G. Blair D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 15: 4801-4810Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest drm is likely to play an important role in regulating multiple cell functions both during early development and in adult tissues. These properties and potential functional significance led us to undertake the biochemical characterization of the Drm gene product. Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence indicated the presence of several significant features, including potential nuclear localization signals near the C terminus, potential N-linked glycosylation sites, and multiple potential sites for phosphorylation. Our results indicate that many of these features are active in regulating the processing and localization of the Drm protein. Specifically, we show that Drm is a glycosylated, phosphorylated, secreted protein present both on the external cell surface and within the ER-Golgi compartments. We demonstrated that Drm is secreted via the constitutive secretory pathway in both glycosylated and nonglycosylated forms and that both forms of Drm can antagonize BMP-4 in C2C12 differentiation assays. In addition, we show that cell surface-associated Drm is capable of binding specifically to125I-BMP-4, indicating that it also has the potential to interfere with signaling. This report describes the first detailed characterization of the processing and localization of a member of the Drm/Gremlin family and suggests properties of potential functional significance.

Asynchronously growing rat primary fibroblasts were labeled with 33P (as33PO4) for 5 h in phosphate-free medium containing 0.2 mCi/ml 33P. Cells were then lysed and analyzed directly (pulse) or after incubation for different periods of time in complete culture medium in excess of cold cysteine (chase). The protein was subsequently immunoprecipitated and separated on 4–20% SDS-PAGE (Novex). For analysis of secreted proteins, Drm-specific serum was added directly into supernatants. Following SDS-PAGE and autoradiography, bands were analyzed densitometrically. Unless otherwise indicated, the protein analysis was done in the Novex system with the use of MultiMark MW standard (Novex). For in vitro translation assay, the EcoRI andBamHI/XhoI fragments containing the coding regions of wild type (wt) and the glycosylation mutant of ratdrm, respectively, were inserted into pBKS. Plasmid DNAs were transcribed and translated using the TNT/T7 reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Inc.) with [35S]l-cysteine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To address processing in vitro, 1.5 μl of canine pancreatic microsomal membranes (Promega, Inc.) were included in the reaction mixtures. Translation products were separated by SDS-PAGE and processed for fluorography. Cells were lysed in boiling 2× SDS sample buffer. Cellular lysates were normalized and electrophoresed on Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE (Novex) and transferred to Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membranes were processed as described previously (1.Topol L.Z. Marx M Laugier D. Bogdanova N.N. Boubnov N.V. Clausen P.A. Calothy G. Blair D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 15: 4801-4810Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Cells grown on 100-mm dishes were treated with 1–2 μg/ml tunicamycin for 16 h and lysed with 2× SDS-loading buffer. Total unlabeled cell lysates or35S-labeled immunocomplexes were treated with peptideN-glycosidase F(PNGF) (0.4 units/10 μg) at 37 °C for 15–20 h as described previously (17.Nunez E. Aragon C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16920-16924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 35S-labeled immunoprecipitates were washed three times in radioimmune precipitation buffer, resuspended in dephosphorylation buffer (50 mmTri-HCl, pH 8.5, 0.1 mm EDTA) with 40–60 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. After the addition of 2× SDS-loading buffer, samples were boiled and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Novex). Cells grown on 100-mm dishes were washed with PBS and treated (two times with 2 ml for 5 min each) with an acidic buffer (50 mm glycine, pH 3.0, 100 mmNaCl) (25.Haigler H.T. Maxfield F.R. Willingham M.C. Pastan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1239-1241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Pearce J.J. Penny G. Rossant J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 209: 98-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Viability of the cells was controlled by staining with trypan blue. Where indicated, 4 ml of acidic wash were clarified by centrifugation 2000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and precipitated by the addition of 10 volumes of ice-cold acetone. Cells cultured on glass coverslips were fixed for 15 min in buffered 3% formaldehyde solution and washed for 30 min in PBS. The fixed cells were permeabilized in cold acetone-methanol (1:1) for 10 min. Live cells were washed with warm serum-free medium, incubated with primary antibodies for 30 min at 37 °C, then washed twice with warm medium, and incubated with secondary antibodies for 30 min at 37 °C. After washing with warm medium, the cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min and mounted. Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed using a Zeiss Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope (LSM 310) configured with a 25 milliwatt argon, UV coherent, and internal HeNe laser with the appropriate lines (488, 347, 543) for fluorescein isothiocyanate, Dapi, and rhodamine excitation. Confocal images were assembled as montages using Adobe Photoshop 4.0 and printed using either a Sony color video printer UP5200 MD Mavigraph, Focus Graphics 4700 with 35-mm camera film back (100 ASA Ektachrome) or a Codonics NP1600 color printer. Recombinant human BMP-4 (R & D Systems) was iodinated according to the chloramine-T method as described (18.Frolik C.A. Wakefield L.M. Smith D.M. Sporn M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10995-11000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were incubated on ice for 2–3 h with 0.2–0.5 nm125I-BMP-4 in the presence or absence of unlabeled ligands in binding buffer (PBS containing 0.9 mmCaCl2, 0.49 mm MgCl2, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) and cross-linked using 1 mmbis[sulfosuccinimidyl] suberate and disuccinimidyl suberate (Pierce) according to the protocol described by Nishitoh et al. (19.Nishotoh H. Ichijo H. Kimura M. Matsumoto T. Makishima F. Yamaguchi A. Yamashita H. Enomoto S. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21345-21352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Cross-linked material was immunoprecipitated with specific antisera and analyzed by PAGE. C2C12 (ATCC) cells were cultured in DMEM (H-G) supplemented with 20% FCS (Life Technologies, Inc.). The osteogenic differentiation assay was performed according to Katagiri et al. (20.Katagiri T. Yamaguchi A. Ikeda T. Yoshiki S. Wozney J.M. Rosen V. Wang E.A. Tanaka H. Omura S. Suda T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 295-299Crossref Scopus (451) Google Scholar). C2C12 was plated in 24-well plates (Corning) at 60% confluence. After a 24-h incubation, the medium was changed to DMEM or supernatant from the cells with 5% FCS containing the indicated concentrations of BMP-4. After 24 h of incubation, alkaline phosphatase activity of the cells was assayed using a colorimetric kit (Sigma). Cells were washed in PBS and lysed by sonication in 300 μl of 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2% Nonidet P-40. Substrate solution (200 μl) was added and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. After stopping with 0.1 n NaOH, absorbance at 405 nm was measured and compared with a standard curve of p-nitrophenol (20.Katagiri T. Yamaguchi A. Ikeda T. Yoshiki S. Wozney J.M. Rosen V. Wang E.A. Tanaka H. Omura S. Suda T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 295-299Crossref Scopus (451) Google Scholar). To characterize the Drm gene product, we immunized rabbits against purified GST-Drm fusion protein and assessed the ability of immune sera to specifically recognize Drm proteins. In Western blots the sera detected two bands with apparent mobilities of 22 and 26 kDa in COS cells transfected with pMEX-DRM (Fig. 2 A, lane 2). HA-tagged Drm migrated with a slightly reduced mobility (Fig. 2, lane 3), consistent with the presence of the tag, and these bands were also detected using anti-HA monoclonal antibody (data not shown). Major bands migrating at about 22 and 26 kDa, and an intermediate band migrating slightly above the 22-kDa band (Fig. 2 B,lane 1), were also detected in normal primary rat fibroblasts that express Drm mRNA (1.Topol L.Z. Marx M Laugier D. Bogdanova N.N. Boubnov N.V. Clausen P.A. Calothy G. Blair D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 15: 4801-4810Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, we failed to detect Drm proteins in v-mos-transformed DTM cells, in agreement with our results that Drm mRNA is down-regulated in these cells (1.Topol L.Z. Marx M Laugier D. Bogdanova N.N. Boubnov N.V. Clausen P.A. Calothy G. Blair D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 15: 4801-4810Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The presence of multiple protein bands in cells expressing adrm cDNA suggested that Drm undergoes post-translational modifications, in agreement with the presence of a signal peptide cleavage site (21.Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4911) Google Scholar), a site for N-glycosylation, and several putative phosphorylation sites in the expected product. To confirm that these signals were functional both in vitro and in vivo, we initially analyzed the in vitro translation products of wt drm and a mutant construct pHA-GDRM (Fig. 1), in which the presumptive 42-NDSE-45 glycosylation site was changed to 42-IEAE-45 (Fig. 1). As seen in Fig.2 C, both translation products migrated with an apparent molecular mass of 23 kDa. To examine post-translational modifications, we also performed a second translation reaction that included a preparation of canine pancreatic microsomal membranes, which allows signal peptide cleavage and core glycosylation to take place. Under these conditions, translation of wtdrm yielded two additional products, which migrated with apparent molecular masses of 24 and 20 kDa (Fig. 2 C,lane 2). In contrast, the 24-kDa product was no longer detectable following translation of the pKA-GDRM mutant (Fig.2 C, lane 4). The size of the lower 20-kDa form is compatible with the product generated by removal of the predicted signal peptide sequence, whereas the 24-kDa band is likely to arise through glycosylation. To verify that glycosylation also takes place in vivo, we transfected Cos cells with wt drm or the pKA-GDRM mutant and analyzed protein expression in control cells and cells treated with tunicamycin, which prevents cotranslational N-glycosylation (22.Duksin D. Mahoney W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3105-3109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following tunicamycin treatment the slower migrating band was no longer detectable in cells transfected with wt drm (Fig.3, A, lanes 3 and4; and B, lanes 1 and 2). Similarly, this band was not visible in normal rat fibroblasts treated with tunicamycin (Fig. 3 B, lanes 3 and4). A similar effect was seen (Fig. 3 A,lanes 1 and 2) if cell extracts were treated with the deglycosylating enzyme peptide N-glycosidase F (17.Nunez E. Aragon C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16920-16924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results indicated that the more slowly migrating form of the protein (26 kDa) observed in vivo represented the glycosylated form of Drm and that the faster migrating (22 kDa) form was generated by signal peptide cleavage. This possibility was verified by analyzing Cos cells transfected with the pHA-DRM-21N mutant, which encodes a protein lacking 21 of the presumptive 24-amino acid signal peptide. These cells exhibited only the faster migrating band (Fig. 3 C,lane 3), and the mobility of this band was not affected by treatment with tunicamycin (Fig. 3 C, lane 4). Finally, we could not detect the 26-kDa band in cells transfected with the pHA-GDRM mutant lacking the glycosylation site (Fig. 3 D,lane 2), in agreement with results of in vitrotranslation. Analysis of the predicted Drm sequence also showed the presence of potential phosphorylation sites by various kinases, such as protein kinase C, cAMP- and GMP-dependent kinases, and casein kinase II (Fig. 1). We examined in vivophosphorylation by metabolically labeling primary rat cells with [35S]l-cysteine, immunoprecipitating the Drm protein, and treating the immunocomplexes with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase before electrophoretic resolution. We observed an overall increased mobility in phosphatase-treated samples (Fig. 3 E,lanes 1 and 2), consistent with the removal of phosphate residues from all Drm forms. Direct confirmation of in vivo phosphorylation was obtained by metabolic labeling with [33P]orthophosphate and immunoprecipitation of Drm. All detectable forms of Drm appeared to be labeled (Fig. 3 F), consistent with the results observed following phosphatase treatment. Thus, our analysis indicates that the multiple forms of Drm protein detected in vivo probably result from a combination of signal peptide cleavage, glycosylation, and phosphorylation. The presence of a putative N-terminal secretory signal sequence (1.Topol L.Z. Marx M Laugier D. Bogdanova N.N. Boubnov N.V. Clausen P.A. Calothy G. Blair D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 15: 4801-4810Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 11.Hsu D.R. Economides A.N. Wang X. Eimon P.M. Harland R.M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 673-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar), together with previous reports (11.Hsu D.R. Economides A.N. Wang X. Eimon P.M. Harland R.M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 673-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar), strongly suggested that Drm was a secreted protein. Therefore, to further analyze the distribution of inter- and extracellular Drm, we performed indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, as shown in Fig.4. In Fig. 4, A andG, fixed, permeabilized Cos-7 cells transiently transfected with HA-DRM exhibited a diffuse, fiber-like network of staining suggestive of a localization in the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi complex. Some cells also exhibited a distinct perinuclear staining, which may indicate that this is the site of Drm synthesis (Fig. 4,A and G). This pattern is analogous to that observed for proteins known to be located in the ER, such as calnexin (23.Hobman T.C. Zhao B. Chan H. Farguhar M.G. Cell. 1998; 9: 1265-1278Google Scholar), and we confirmed this localization using monoclonal antibodies directed against the Golgi-specific p58K protein (Fig. 4 F), a marker of the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (24.Saraste J. Kuismanen E. Semin. Cell Biol. 1992; 3: 343-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Our results showed that both Drm (Fig. 4 G) and p58K (Fig. 4 F) colocalized in the Golgi stacks (Fig. 4 H). In contrast to the permeabilized cells, nonpermeabilized cells showed a clumped, punctate pattern that appeared to surround the outer surface of the cell membrane (Fig. 4 B), indicating the presence of Drm on the external cell surface. Analysis of live, unfixed cells showed a similar pattern (Fig. 4 D). We observed a similar subcellular distribution of Drm in COS cells by using anti-HA antibodies and in rat cells expressing the endogenous protein (data not shown). These data indicate that Drm is accumulated in the ER and after release from the ER transverses the Golgi apparatus to the outer surface of the cell. To confirm that the hydrophobic region was necessary for the entrance of Drm into the secretory pathway, we transfected Cos-7 cells with pHA-DRM-21N, which lacked the signal sequence. The truncated protein was exclusively intranuclear (Fig. 4 C), in agreement with the fact that the protein contains two nuclear localization signals (amino acids 147–150 and 168–171). As expected, we did not observe surface staining in these live or nonpermeabilized cells (data not shown). Bands corresponding to glycosylated and unglycosylated Drm, as well as minor bands consistent with phosphorylated forms, could be detected in immunoprecipitates from the supernatants of 35S-labeled Drm expressing cells using Drm-specific antibodies (Fig.5 A, lane 1), confirming that DRM could be secreted into the medium. Preimmune serum failed to detect DRM-specific bands (Fig. 5 A, lanes 2 and 4). The mobilities of the secreted and cell-associated forms (Fig. 5 A, lanes 1 and3) appeared to be identical, suggesting all forms of Drm were released into the supernatant. Interestingly, cells expressing Drm containing a mutation that destroyed the glycosylation site still secreted the protein. The supernatant form exhibited a mobility consistent with a cleaved nonglycosylated form of tagged Drm (Fig.5 A, lane 6 compared with lane 5), indicating that glycosylation was not necessary for the processing and release of Drm from expressing cells. To elucidate the kinetics of Drm synthesis, release, and degradation, we performed pulse-chase experiments using HT1080 cells transfected with a drm expression c"
https://openalex.org/W2318856976,"Besides its known role as a translational controlling factor, the double stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) is a key transcriptional regulator exerting antiviral and antitumoural activities. We have recently described that induction of NF-κB by PKR is involved in apoptosis commitment. To define how PKR mediates NF-κB activation by dsRNA, we have used two different approaches, one based on expression of PKR by a vaccinia virus (VV) recombinant and the other based on induction of endogenous PKR by poly I:C (pIC) treatment. We found that NF-κB complexes induced by PKR are composed primarily of p50-p65 heterodimers and also of c-rel-p50 heterodimers. As described for other stimuli, following pIC treatment, PKR phosphorylates the NF-κB inhibitor IκBα at serine 32 before degradation. Expression by VV recombinants of IKK1 or IKK2 dominant negative mutants together with PKR showed inhibition of PKR-induced NF-κB activation, as measured both by gel shift and luciferase reporter assays. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that PKR interacts with the IKK complex. Our findings demonstrate that physiological function(s) of PKR involve activation of the IκB kinase complex."
https://openalex.org/W2080284013,"APP-BP1 binds to the amyloid precursor protein (APP) carboxyl-terminal domain. Recent work suggests that APP-BP1 participates in a novel ubiquitinylation-related pathway involving the ubiquitin-like molecule NEDD8. We show here that, <i>in vivo</i>in mammalian cells, APP-BP1 interacts with hUba3, its presumptive partner in the NEDD8 activation pathway, and that the APP-BP1 binding site for hUba3 is within amino acids 443–479. We also provide evidence that the human APP-BP1 molecule can rescue the ts41 mutation in Chinese hamster cells. This mutation previously has been shown to lead to successive S phases of the cell cycle without intervening G<sub>2</sub>, M, and G<sub>1</sub>, suggesting that the product of this gene negatively regulates entry into the S phase and positively regulates entry into mitosis. We show that expression of APP-BP1 in ts41 cells drives the cell cycle through the S-M checkpoint and that this function requires both hUba3 and hUbc12. Overexpression of APP-BP1 in primary neurons causes apoptosis via the same pathway. A specific caspase-6 inhibitor blocks this apoptosis. These findings are discussed in the context of abnormalities in the cell cycle that have been observed in Alzheimer's disease."

RNase-L mediates the antiviral activity through the degradation of viral RNAs, and the anticellular effects of the 2–5A system are thought to be similarly mediated through the degradation of cellular transcripts. However, specific RNase-L-regulated cellular RNAs have not been identified. To isolate candidate RNase-L substrates, differential display was used to identify mRNAs that exhibited increased expression in RNase-L-deficient N1E-115 cells as compared with RNase-L-transfected cells. A novel interferon-stimulated gene encoding a 43-kDa ubiquitin-specific protease, designated ISG43, was identified in this screen.

The kinetics of ISG43 induction were identical in wild type and RNase-L knock-out fibroblasts; however, the decline in ISG43 mRNA following interferon treatment was markedly attenuated in RNase-L knock-out fibroblasts. The delayed shut-off kinetics of ISG43 mRNA corresponded to an increase in its half-life in RNase-L-deficient cells. ISG15 mRNA also displayed RNase-L-dependent regulation.

Accordingly, the stringent regulation of genes that mediate critical cellular functions, such as cell cycling (2.Maity A. McKenna W.G. Muschel R.J.

Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 1633-1642PubMed Google Scholar), and stress response (5.Gorospe M. Wang X. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1400-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), frequently involves the modulation of mRNA half-life. The stability of cytoplasmic mRNAs is determined by the combined effects of cis-acting RNA elements and trans-acting protein factors. The 5′-CAP and 3′-poly(A) structures present on most RNA polymerase II transcripts provide both protection from ribonucleases and enhanced translatability (6.Beelman C.A. Parker R. Cell. 1995; 81: 179-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Indeed, studies in yeast identified a pathway of sequential deadenylation and decapping leading to the 5′ to 3′ degradation of the transcript body that may represent a default decay pathway for many eucaryotic mRNAs (6.Beelman C.A. Parker R. Cell. 1995; 81: 179-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Diverse cis elements that are frequently localized to the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR)1 of mRNAs also influence mRNA stability. AU-rich elements (AREs) found in the 3′-UTR of unstable mRNAs represent the best characterized RNA-destabilizing elements in mammalian cells (reviewed in Ref. 7.Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1673) Google Scholar). Three classes of ARE exhibit distinct capacities to destabilize heterologous transcripts through the accelerated deadenylation of their resident mRNAs (8.Xu N. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4611-4621Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Several ARE-binding proteins have been implicated in the destabilization of ARE-containing mRNAs including AUF1 (9.Zhang W. Wagner B.J. Ehrenman K. Schaefer A.W. DeMaria C.T. Crater D. DeHaven K. Long L. Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7652-7665Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar) and tristetraprolin (10.Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, HuR binds and stabilizes transcripts possessing AREs (11.Peng S.S. Chen C.Y. Xu N. Shyu A.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3461-3470Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). HuC binds both ARE and poly(A) sequences, suggesting that it may function in ARE-directed deadenylation (12.Abe R. Sakashita E. Yamamoto K. Sakamoto H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4895-4901Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Although deadenylation appears to be the first step in the degradation of many eucaryotic mRNAs, deadenylation-independent decay has been reported for a subset of mRNAs (6.Beelman C.A. Parker R. Cell. 1995; 81: 179-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Endonucleolytic cleavage at structure- or sequence-specific cis elements in the mRNA is thought to be the rate-limiting step in deadenylation-independent decay, with decay products being rapidly degraded by nonspecific exonucleases. For example, in iron-replete cells, iron-response elements in the 3′-UTR of transferrin receptor mRNA are targeted for endonucleolytic cleavage in the absence of deadenylation (13.Binder R. Horowitz J.A. Basilion J.P. Koeller D.M. Klausner R.D. Harford J.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1969-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Although certain cis- and trans-acting factors that influence RNA stability have been identified, less is known about the ribonucleases that mediate RNA degradation. A polysome-based in vitromRNA decay system has been employed to identify and purify an mRNase involved in c-Myc mRNA degradation (14.Lee C.H. Leeds P. Ross J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25261-25271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar); importantly, this mRNase displays specificity for the c-Myc mRNA in vitroand in vivo. A Xenopus ribonuclease that functions in the estrogen-regulated destabilization of serum proteins and the cis elements on its albumin mRNA substrate have been characterized (15.Chernokalskaya E. Dompenciel R. Schoenberg D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 735-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The identification of both RNA and ribonuclease components of these mRNA decay systems now permits studies to address directly the important question of how specific mRNAs are targeted for degradation in the cell. The 2–5A system is an interferon (IFN)-regulated RNA decay pathway comprised of two major enzymatic components: a family of 2–5A synthetases and a 2–5A-dependent endoribonuclease, RNase-L (reviewed in Ref. 16.Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3368) Google Scholar). 2–5A synthetase is induced in IFN-treated cells and, in the presence of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), polymerizes ATP into unique 5′-phosphorylated, 2′,5′-linked oligoadenylates (2–5A). 2–5A, in turn, binds the latent RNase-L, leading to its dimerization and activation (17.Dong B. Silverman R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4133-4137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar); activated RNase-L catalyzes the cleavage of single-stranded RNA. The 2–5A system was first studied as a mediator of the antiviral activity of IFN, and transfection of cDNAs encoding 2–5A synthetase (18.Chebath J. Benech P. Revel M. Vigneron M. Nature. 1987; 330: 587-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) or RNase-L (19.Diaz-Guerra M. Rivas C. Esteban M.

Interferon Cytokine Res. 1998; 18: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) has confirmed this role. In addition, a protein inhibitor of RNase-L has been implicated in regulating RNase-L activity in virus-infected cells (21.Martinand C. Salehzada T. Silhol M. Lebleu B. Bisbal C. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1998; 18: 1031-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Inhibition of RNase-L activity using dominant-negative and targeted gene disruption strategies revealed that RNase-L also functions in IFN-mediated growth inhibition and in apoptosis (22.Hassel B.A. Zhou A.

Silverman R.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6355-6363Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). In virus-infected cells, viral RNA appears to be targeted for degradation by RNase-L, possibly through a localized activation of the 2–5A system by viral dsRNA (25.Baglioni C. De Benedetti A. Williams G.J. J. Virol. 1984; 52: 865-871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Li X.L. Blackford J.A. Hassel B.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2752-2759Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in the absence of virus infection, the cellular RNA substrates of RNase-L are not known. Interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), including those of the 2–5A system, encode the proteins that mediate the effects of IFN in cells. Studies of the IFN system therefore focused initially on the identification of ISGs and more recently on the transcriptional activation of ISGs through the JAK/STAT signaling pathway (27.Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4977) Google Scholar). Interferon-regulated gene expression is transient, characterized by distinct induction and shut-off phases. Indeed, the tight regulation of ISGs is critical, as constitutive expression of ISGs is often deleterious to cells (23.Castelli J.C. Hassel B.A. Wood K.A. Li X.L. Amemiya K. Dalakas M.C. Torrence P.F. Youle R.J. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 967-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 28.Lee S.B. Esteban M. Virology. 1994; 199: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Several inhibitors of IFN signaling that function to limit the transcriptional induction of ISGs have recently been identified (e.g. suppressors of cytokine signaling and protein inhibitors of activated STATs; reviewed in Ref. 29.Hoey T. Schindler U. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1998; 8: 582-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, posttranscriptional mechanisms to eliminate existing ISG-encoded gene products have not been described. Such posttranscriptional regulation would permit a more rapid and efficient attenuation of the IFN response. In this study, we sought to identify mRNAs regulated by RNase-L as a first step in understanding the mechanisms by which the 2–5A system elicits its anticellular effects. Toward this end, we characterized an RNase-L-deficient cell line and restored RNase-L activity in stable transfectants, providing a system in which differentially expressed mRNAs represent candidate RNase-L substrates. Differential display analysis of RNase-L-deficient and competent cell lines identified a novel ISG as a candidate RNase-L substrate. This ISG encodes a 43-kDa ubiquitin-specific protease (UBP), designated ISG43. The decline of ISG43 mRNA following IFN treatment is markedly reduced in fibroblasts derived from RNase-L knock-out (KO) as compared with wild type (WT) mice. Moreover, ISG43 mRNA exhibits an increased half-life in RNase-L KO fibroblasts, demonstrating RNase-L-dependent regulation of ISG43 mRNA stability in intact cells. The transcript encoding ISG15 is also regulated by RNase-L. These data provide evidence of a novel role for RNase-L in the posttranscriptional attenuation of the IFN response; experimental evidence consistent with a model for RNase-L functioning as an effector and an attenuator of IFN action is discussed. All cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% balanced air at 37 °C. Cells were cultured in the following growth media: RNase-L −/−, +/+ MEFs (generously supplied by Robert H. Silverman, The Cleveland Clinic Foundation), and L929- Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum, and antibiotic/antimycotic; N1E-115-medium 199, 10% newborn calf serum, non-essential amino acids, sodium pyruvate, vitamin mix, and antibiotic/antimycotic; 2fTGH, U3A, and U4A (kindly provided by George R. Stark, The Cleveland Clinic Foundation)-Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum, 250 μg/ml hygromycin, and antibiotic/antimycotic (all cell culture reagents from Life Technologies, Inc.). The human RNase-L cDNA in the pcDNAIneo vector (Invitrogen) in the sense orientation or vector alone was transfected into N1E-115 cells by calcium phosphate coprecipitation (Life Technologies, Inc.). Stable transfectants were clonally selected in 250 μg/ml G418; N1E-RNase-L.1 and -L.2 refer to independent clonal cell lines. Interferon treatment used murine α + β (Lee Biomolecular Laboratories), human IFNα2 (Hoffmann-La Roche), or human IFNγ (Ciba-Geigy) at the concentrations indicated. For 2–5A-trimer triphosphate a concentration of 1 μm was transfected into cells by calcium phosphate co-precipitation for 75 min. The cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline, refed with growth medium, and incubated for 2.5 h; total RNA was then harvested for analysis using Trizol Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). RNase-L in postmitochondrial supernatants was labeled by UV cross-linking to [α-32P]-2–5A and analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described previously (30.Nolan-Sorden N.L. Lesiak K. Bayard B. Torrence P.F. Silverman R.H. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 184: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Transfected RNase-L protein was measured by Western blot analysis using a monoclonal antibody specific for the human enzyme (kindly provided by Beihua Dong and Robert H. Silverman, The Cleveland Clinic Foundation); RNase-L was visualized by reacting blots with ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) which were used to expose X-Omat AR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Total and poly(A)+ RNA was analyzed on glyoxal-agarose gels by ethidium staining and Northern blot hybridization. Hybridization probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by random priming (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The cDNA hybridization probe for ISG15 (31.Blomstrom D.C. Fahey D. Kutny R. Korant B.D. Knight Jr., E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8811-8816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was described previously. For analyses of mRNA half-life, cells were treated with 5 μg/ml actinomycin D (Sigma) for the indicated periods. Northern blots were quantified by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics); these data were used in determinations of mRNA half-life (1.Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA (0.2 μg/reaction) was reverse-transcribed as described by the supplier using oligo(dT)11 n(n = A, G, C) as primer (RNAmap, GenHunter), and 4 μl of the 20-μl reaction was PCR-amplified (Amplitaq, Perkin-Elmer) in the presence of [α-33P]dATP and arbitrary sequence upstream primers as indicated in figure legends. Amplification conditions were as described by the supplier (GenHunter). Reaction products were analyzed on 6% acrylamide denaturing sequencing gels and autoradiographed. PCR products representing differentially expressed mRNAs were excised from the gel and reamplified using the original primers; reamplified PCR products were purified on 1.5% agarose gels and cloned into the PCRII vector (Invitrogen). PCR products were sequenced using SP6 and T7 primers (Biopolymer Core Facility, University of Maryland, Baltimore). The NA4.1 PCR product was used as a hybridization probe to screen a cDNA expression library constructed from IFNγ-treated RAW cells in the λ Zap II vector (Stratagene). Several positive clones were isolated and sequenced; one of these clones, designated NA4.1.7 and subsequently renamed ISG43, contained the full-length 1735-bp cDNA encoding an ORF of 368 amino acids. GenBankTM sequence analyses were performed using the Blast algorithm (32.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69731) Google Scholar). The human ISG43 homologue was isolated by reverse transcriptase-PCR. Total RNA (2 μg) from HT1080 cells treated for 6 h with 1000 units/ml human IFNα2 was reverse-transcribed (Superscript II, Life Technologies, Inc.) using oligo(dT) as primer. 4 μl of the reverse transcriptase reaction was PCR-amplified (Pfu turbo, Stratagene) using primers from human-expressed sequence tags spanning nucleotides −8 → 12 (forward, 5′GATCACGAATGAGCAAGGCG3′, GenBankTM accession numberAA148178) and 1048 → 1067 (reverse, 5′ACACTGGATGTCTTCCCAGG3′, GenBankTM accession number AA131145) of the murine coding region. This PCR product was cloned into the pCR-blunt topo vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. The C-terminal 19 amino acids and the 3′-UTR of the human ISG43 cDNA was isolated using the 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends procedure (Life Technologies, Inc.) and a gene-specific primer spanning a unique internal NcoI site (5′ACTGTGCCATGGAGAGTAGC3′). PCR products encoding the complete human ISG43 cDNA were subcloned using the unique NcoI site and sequenced. This sequence was submitted to the GenBankTMunder accession number AF176642. The plasmids containing the murine and human ISG43 cDNAs were linearized with HindIII and in vitrotranscribed using T7 RNA polymerase as described by the supplier (Promega). In vitro transcripts (500 ng/reaction) were translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) in the presence of [l-35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and analyzed by PAGE and autoradiography. The murine neuroblastoma cell line, N1E-115, was previously determined to lack detectable RNase-L protein (33.Silverman R.H. Dieffenbach C.W. Krause D. Friedman R.M. Merigan T. Sreevalsan T. Interferons as Cell Growth Inhibitors and Antitumor Factor. Alan. R. Liss, Inc., New York1986: 143-150Google Scholar); we sought to characterize further this RNase-L deficiency and to restore RNase-L activity by stable expression of a transfected RNase-L cDNA. RNase-L mRNA was not detected in total or poly(A)+ RNA from control and IFN-treated N1E cells by Northern blot analysis (Fig.1 A) or reverse transcriptase-PCR (not shown). In contrast, RNase-L mRNA was readily detected in IFN-treated murine L929 cells (Fig. 1 A). 2–5A synthetase was induced to comparable levels by IFN in both N1E and L929 cells (Fig. 1 A, lower panel), demonstrating that the lack of RNase-L induction in N1E cells is not due to a defect in IFN signaling. To restore RNase-L expression, N1E cells were stably transfected with a human RNase-L cDNA expression construct (N1E-RNase-L) or vector alone (N1E-vector; pcDNAIneo, Invitrogen). Interestingly, in contrast to many other cell types studied in which expression of transfected RNase-L induces apoptosis (23.Castelli J.C. Hassel B.A. Wood K.A. Li X.L. Amemiya K. Dalakas M.C. Torrence P.F. Youle R.J. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 967-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 34.Diaz-Guerra M. Rivas C. Esteban M. Virology. 1997; 236: 354-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), constitutive RNase-L expression did not reduce the viability of N1E cells (data not shown). RNase-L protein was measured by covalent cross-linking of [α-32P]pCp-labeled 2–5A (30.Nolan-Sorden N.L. Lesiak K. Bayard B. Torrence P.F. Silverman R.H. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 184: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). No RNase-L protein was observed in parental N1E or vector control lysates using this highly sensitive method (Fig. 1 B, 1st and 4th lanes), whereas RNase-L expression was easily detected in lysates from clonally derived transfectants (Fig. 1 B, 2nd and 3rd lanes). Western blot analyses using a monoclonal antibody that is specific for the transfected human RNase-L (17.Dong B. Silverman R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4133-4137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) demonstrated that RNase-L expression was derived from the transgene rather than from an activation of the endogenous murine gene (Fig. 1 B, lower panel). To determine if RNase-L activity was detectable in N1E cells, untreated and IFN-treated cells were transfected with 2–5A activator, and total RNA was analyzed for rRNA cleavage. In the presence of saturating amounts of 2–5A as were used in this experiment (1 μmtrimer triphosphate), RNase-L cleaves rRNA into discrete characteristic products (35.Silverman R.H. Skehel J.J. James T.C. Wreschner D.H. Kerr I.M. J. Virol. 1983; 46: 1051-1055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). No rRNA cleavage was detected in 2–5A-transfected N1E cells (Fig. 1 C, 6th and 8th lanes). In contrast, rRNA cleavage products were clearly observed following 2–5A transfection of N1E-RNase-L cells (Fig. 1 C, 2nd and4th lanes), demonstrating that the transgene-encoded RNase-L was enzymatically active. Taken together, these data demonstrate that RNase-L expression in N1E cells is either completely lacking or exceedingly low and that these cells are functionally null for RNase-L activity. N1E-derived vector control and RNase-L N1E transfectants that lack and possess functional RNase-L activity, respectively, thus provided a system to identify RNase-L-regulated mRNAs. RNA substrates of RNase-L are predicted to exhibit a relative increase in expression in RNase-L-deficient as compared with RNase-L-competent cells as a result of an increase in their mRNA stability. Differential display PCR analysis was used to identify mRNAs that were differentially expressed in N1E-vector and N1E-RNase-L cell lines. Cells were treated for 18 h with murine IFNα + β to induce 2–5A synthetase and activate RNase-L, thereby enhancing RNase-L-dependent differences in gene expression between N1E-RNase-L and N1E-vector cells. Total RNA was reverse-transcribed and PCR-amplified in the presence of [α-33P]dATP using multiple primer sets (GenHunter). PCR products that displayed a reduced signal in cDNA from N1E-RNase-L as compared with N1E-vector cells represented candidate RNase-L substrates; changes in gene expression resulting from IFN treatment were also detected by differential display. PCR products that did not change in intensity provided an internal control for gel loading and amplification (e.g. clone NC3.1 and bands labeled C in Fig.2 A). Clone NC3.1 was identified as the L27a ribosomal RNA protein and was employed as a constitutively expressed control mRNA in subsequent Northern blots. Many of the PCR products isolated exhibited apparent differential expression that was not reproduced in Northern blot analyses, as has been previously reported for the differential display technique (36.Sun Y. Hegamyer G. Colburn N.H. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1139-1144PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, one PCR product, clone NA4.1, displayed both IFN- and RNase-L-dependent regulation. In the absence of IFN, NA4.1 was undetectable; however, this PCR product was dramatically increased in IFN-treated samples. Although IFN treatment induced NA4.1 in both N1E-vector and N1E-RNase-L cells, the induced levels of the NA4.1 PCR product were markedly reduced in samples from N1E-RNase-L cells, fulfilling the criteria for a candidate RNase-L substrate (Fig.2 A). Importantly, Northern blot analysis confirmed the NA4.1 mRNA regulation observed using differential display. The 350-bp NA4.1 PCR product hybridized to a 1.7-kilobase pair IFN-induced mRNA, and the IFN-induced levels of this transcript were significantly reduced in N1E-RNase-L as compared with N1E-vector cells (Fig. 2 B). These results indicated that NA4.1 mRNA was induced by IFN and negatively regulated by RNase-L. To dissect further this unique pattern of regulation, we focused our studies on the characterization and regulation of NA4.1 mRNA. Clone NA4.1 was used to screen a cDNA library prepared from an IFNγ-treated murine macrophage cell line (RAW). Several positive clones were isolated, one of which contained the full-length NA4.1 sequence. Sequence analysis of this 1735-bp clone revealed an 1107-bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a 368-amino acid, 43-kDa protein (Fig.3 B). Consistent with this prediction, in vitro transcription and translation of NA4.1 resulted in a 43-kDa product (Fig. 3 C); accordingly, we have named this interferon-stimulated gene, ISG43. The amino acid sequence contained regions of strong homology to ubiquitin-specific proteases, a family of enzymes that function to cleave ubiquitin from a broad range of protein substrates. In fact, a cDNA identical to ISG43 has recently been shown to encode a functional UBP (Ref. 37.Liu L.Q. Ilaria Jr., R. Kingsley P.D. Iwama A. van Etten R.A. Palis J. Zhang D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3029-3038Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar and see “Discussion”). UBP homology in ISG43 is restricted primarily to four conserved domains including the Cys box and His box motifs (Fig.3 B). The Cys box cysteine residue, Cys-61 in murine ISG43, is thought to be the active site nucleophile. The QHDAAQL and LPQTLTIHLMRF motifs (Fig. 3 B) as well as less conserved regions following the His box (not shown) are present in all UBPs (38.Wilkinson K.D. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Extensive divergence in the remaining residues typifies UBP family members and may reflect unique properties of individual UBPs such as substrate specificity (38.Wilkinson K.D. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). ISG43 exhibited homology to several human expressed sequence tags; therefore, the human ISG43 cDNA was isolated by PCR and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (Fig. 3 A). The human gene encodes a 372-amino acid protein; consistent with this ORF,in vitro transcription and translation of this cDNA produced a protein of approximately 43 kDa (Fig. 3 C). The human protein is highly conserved, with 70% identity to the murine gene (Fig. 3 B) and 76% identity to the recently isolated porcine gene (39.Zhang X. Shin J. Molitor T.W. Schook L.B. Rutherford M.S. Virology. 1999; 262: 152-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The complete human coding region is comprised of 10 exons spanning 15.7 kilobase pairs of a chromosome 22q11 genomic clone (GenBankTM accession number AC008079). Consistent with the dramatic induction of ISG43 by IFN (Fig. 2), a strong IFNβ response element was identified in the putative promoter region of the human gene. 2X.-L. Li and B. A. Hassel, unpublished data. Little sequence similarity is observed in the 3′-UTRs of the human, murine, and porcine cDNAs; however, several features are conserved. Specifically, the presence of (i) ARE elements, (ii) sequences recently determined to activate 2–5A synthetase (Ref. 40.Hartmann R. Norby P.L. Martensen P.M. Jorgensen P. James M.C. Jacobsen C.

Chem. 1998; 273: 3236-3246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar; Fig. 3 A), and (iii) regions with the potential to form secondary structures (not shown) in the ISG43 3′-UTR may be important in RNase-L-mediated mRNA destabilization. Indeed, the coordinate activation of 2–5A synthetase and RNase-L has been implicated in substrate recognition by RNase-L (Refs. 25.Baglioni C. De Benedetti A. Williams G.J. J. Virol. 1984; 52: 865-871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 40.Hartmann R. Norby P.L. Martensen P.M. Jorgensen P. James M.C. Jacobsen C. Moestrup S.K. Clemens M.J. Justesen J. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2066506893,"The c-fos enhancer can be activated by many signaling pathways through distinct elements of the enhancer. The enhancer contains at its core the serum response element (SRE) that binds serum response factor (SRF). On the 5' side of the SRE is a site for p62TCF which binds only when SRF is bound as well. p62TCF is encoded by three ets-related genes, Elk-1, SAP1 and SAP2. Each of these factors contain a transcriptional activation domain that is activated by phosphorylation by MAP kinases. On the 3' side of the SRE is the 'c-fos AP1 site' (FAP1) whose role has been less clear. We find here that the FAP1 site contributes strongly to phorbol ester (TPA) and Erk MAP kinase activation of the c-fos enhancer and that both the p62TCF and FAP1 sites are required for effective activation of the enhancer. We further find that the FAP1 site binds ATF1 and CREB from HeLa nuclear extracts and that the phosphorylation of these factors is induced by TPA. ATF1 and CREB can be phosphorylated by Rsk2 which is a protein kinase directly activated by Erk MAP kinases. These results suggest a signaling pathway in which Erk MAP kinase activates the c-fos enhancer by direct phosphorylation of p62TCF and by activation of Rsk related kinases that phosphorylate ATF1 and CREB."

At each of the sites at which AQP5 is expressed, the composition or tonicity of the surface layers may be acutely altered under both normal (autonomic stimulation) and pathophysiological conditions; however, the effects of osmotic stress on AQP5 expression have not been examined.Investigation of osmotic stress in mammalian tissues has focused principally on the kidney, in which cells of the renal medulla may experience levels >1000 mosm in humans (6.Miyakawa H. Woo S.K. Chen C.P. Dahl S.C. Handler J.S. Kwon H.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F753-F761PubMed Google Scholar). In response to these hypertonic conditions, cells accumulate small organic molecules, such as betaine, myo-inositol, taurine, and sorbitol. These “compatible” osmolytes lower cellular ionic strength, protecting cells from the adverse effects of elevated intracellular salt concentrations (7.McManus M.L. Churchwell K.B. Strange K. N. Engl.

Specifically, the p38 MAP kinase pathway plays a definitive role in osmotic induction of both the betaine transporter (betaine/γ-amino-n-butyric acid) and the sodium-dependent myo-inositol transporter (15.Sheikh-Hamad D. Di Mari J. Suki W.N. Safirstein R. Watts B.A. Rouse D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1832-1837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar,16.Denkert C. Warskulat U. Hensel F. Haussinger D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 354: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).This study was designed to assess the affects of osmotic stress on AQP5 expression and to identify mechanisms regulating the response. We find that expression of AQP5 protein is induced by hypertonic stress in cultured mouse lung epithelial cells and in tissues from hyperosmolar rats. Additionally, we demonstrate that this induction requires selective activation and involvement of the ERK MAP kinase pathway. To our knowledge, these studies provide the first example of osmotic regulation of a nonrenal aquaporin and also provide the first evidence that aquaporin expression can be regulated by signaling through MAP kinase pathways.DISCUSSIONDiscovery of the aquaporin family of water channel proteins has provided insight into molecular mechanisms of membrane water permeability. It is increasingly clear that aquaporins can be rate-limiting for water transport, as evidenced by recent demonstrations in the kidney (33.Deen P.M. Verdijk M.A. Knoers N.V. Wieringa B. Monnens L.A. van Os C.H. van Oost B.A. Science. 1994; 264: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar, 34.Ma T. Yang B. Gillespie A. Carlson E.J. Epstein C.J. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4296-4299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), lung (35.Bai C. Fukuda N. Song Y. Ma T. Matthay M.A. Verkman A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 555-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), and salivary glands (5.Ma T. Song Y. Gillespie A. Carlson E.J. Epstein C.J. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20071-20074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). However, with few exceptions, mechanisms regulating aquaporin expression remain poorly understood. These studies were undertaken to examine the effects of osmotic stress on expression of AQP5, an epithelial water channel found in the apical membrane of type I pneumocytes and submucosal glands in the respiratory tract, as well as in the apical membrane of salivary and lacrimal glands and corneal epithelium. In each of these locations, the osmolality of aqueous surface layers may vary in some circumstances. Here, we describe that in a lung epithelial cell line, as well as in rat tissues, AQP5 is up-regulated by hypertonic stress. Osmotic induction of AQP1 in a kidney cell line was recently described (36.Jenq W. Mathieson I.M. Ihara W. Ramirez G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The studies reported here provide the first example of osmotic induction of a nonrenal aquaporin, as well as the first demonstration that aquaporin expression can be regulated by the MAP kinase signaling cascade.Upon exposure to hyperosmotic stress, inorganic ions flow into cells, only to be replaced over several hours by organic osmolytes, such as betaine and myo-inositol (37.Burg M.B. Kwon E.D. Kultz D. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1598-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Although total DNA synthesis, RNA transcription, and protein synthesis decrease with osmotic stress (38.Cohen D.M. Wasserman J.C. Gullans S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: C594-C601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a limited number of genes have been identified that are up-regulated (37.Burg M.B. Kwon E.D. Kultz D. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1598-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 39.Blomberg A. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 1429-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Induction of the transporters and enzymes that facilitate accumulation of intracellular organic osmolytes has been the focus of intense investigation (37.Burg M.B. Kwon E.D. Kultz D. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1598-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Given the intimate relationship of solute and water transport, we explored whether aquaporin expression might also be affected by osmotic stress. AQP5 mRNA and protein were induced by hypertonic stress in MLE-15 cells. AQP5 mRNA expression peaked at 12 h, whereas protein expression peaked at 24 h, a time course similar to induction of organic solute transporters (40.Smardo F.L.J. Burg M.B. Garcia-Perez A. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C776-C782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When MLE-15 cells were incubated with hypertonic medium and then returned to isotonic conditions, AQP5 mRNA and protein expression fell nearly to baseline levels within hours, indicating that both expression and degradation may be tightly controlled.These studies provide the first link between aquaporin expression and a MAP kinase signaling cascade. MAP kinases have been implicated in a wide range of cellular events, from growth factor-mediated proliferation to numerous stress responses (41.Kultz D. Burg M. J. Exp. Biol. 1998; 201: 3015-3021Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42.Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2249) Google Scholar). We demonstrate selective activation of ERK by hypertonic stress in MLE-15 cells. This finding contrasts to previous studies in alveolar type II cells (31.Edwards Y.S. Sutherland L.M. Power J.H. Nicholas T.E. Murray A.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L670-L678PubMed Google Scholar) and inner medullary collecting duct cells (13.Berl T. Siriwardana G. Ao L. Butterfield L.M. Heasley L.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F305-F311PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Zhang Z. Yang X.Y. Cohen D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1104-C1112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in which all three MAP kinase cascades (ERK, JNK, and p38) are activated by osmotic stress. Incubation of cells with two distinct MEK inhibitors, U0126 and PD98059, prevented activation of ERK by hypertonic stress and dramatically blocked both AQP5 mRNA and protein induction. Neither basal nor hypertonically induced Na,K-ATPase expression was affected by these drugs, suggesting that these inhibitors are not globally affecting protein synthesis pathways.Although ERK activation is necessary for AQP5 induction in this model, activation of ERK by TPA did not increase AQP5 expression, either at baseline or following hypertonic stimulation, indicating that additional signaling steps are required. Signaling events both upstream and downstream from ERK in this model are currently under investigation. AQP5 was induced only when relatively impermeable solutes were added to the medium. This requirement for hypertonic, rather than simply hyperosmolar, stimulation provides some insight into upstream events, as it suggests that perturbation of the cell membrane or cytoskeleton may be necessary for induction to occur. Downstream ERK is known to activate several transcription factors, including Elk1, Ets1, c-Myc, Tal, and STAT, which then directly activate target genes (42.Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2249) Google Scholar). Our data suggest transcriptional activation of AQP5, because hypertonic stress increased AQP5 mRNA expression severalfold without increasing mRNA stability. This effect may not be direct, however, based both on the time course of induction (several hours required) and preliminary studies showing that cyclohexamide blocks hypertonic induction of AQP5 mRNA (data not shown). A recently identified hypertonicity-induced transcription factor, TonEBP (tonicity-responsive element-binding protein) (43.Miyakawa H. Woo S.K. Dahl S.C. Handler J.S. Kwon H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2538-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), is a candidate protein for the intermediate in this pathway. We have been unable to demonstrate activation of a 1.5-kilobase AQP5 proximal promoter by hypertonicity in preliminary experiments (data not shown); however, no tonicity response element consensus sites are present in this part of the promoter. Tonicity response elements have been identified as far as 50 kilobases upstream in the case of sodium-dependentmyo-inositol transporter (44.Rim J.S. Atta M.G. Dahl S.C. Berry G.T. Handler J.S. Kwon H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20615-20621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). We suspect that, in a similar fashion, relevant cis elements in the AQP5 promoter are outside of the 1.5-kilobase proximal promoter as well.We believe that these data strongly support potential in vivo relevance of this phenomenon for two reasons. First, surface liquid osmolalities have been demonstrated under some circumstances to reach 430–480 milliosmoles/kg in human nasal secretions (45.Anderson S.D. Togias A.G. Busse W.W. Holgate S.T. Asthma and Rhinitis. Blackwell Scientific, Boston1995: 1178-1195Google Scholar) and canine airway secretions (46.Man S.F. Adams G.K. Proctor D.F. J. Appl. Physiol. 1979; 46: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 47.Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Bromberg P.A. Gatzy J.T. J. Appl. Physiol. 1981; 50: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We observed a dose-response relationship for hypertonic induction of AQP5 beginning with as little as 25 mosm supplemental sorbitol, well within this range. Second, and more importantly, using previously described techniques for generating hyperosmolarity in vivo (22.Lohr J.W. McReynolds J. Grimaldi T. Acara M. Life Sci. 1988; 43: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), we show that AQP5 was induced in the lung, submandibular gland, and lacrimal gland of hyperosmolar rats when compared with isosmolar controls. Future investigation of this phenomenon in additional in vivomodels will allow more specific assessment of the role for hypertonic induction of AQP5 in different pathophysiologic conditions.With the recognition that aquaporins can be rate-limiting for water transport comes an increased need for understanding the mechanisms regulating their expression, as well as their relevance to human disease. Changes in the tonicity of airway surface liquid have been implicated in the pathophysiology of cystic fibrosis (48.Smith J.J. Travis S.M. Greenberg E.P. Welsh M.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 229-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar), as well as in some forms of exercise- or cold-induced asthma (45.Anderson S.D. Togias A.G. Busse W.W. Holgate S.T. Asthma and Rhinitis. Blackwell Scientific, Boston1995: 1178-1195Google Scholar, 49.Anderson S.D. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1984; 73: 660-665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 50.Anderson S.D. Respirology. 1996; 1: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Conditions associated with increased minute ventilation have been shown to increase airway drying and alter surface liquid osmolarity. Likewise, dry eyes and mouth are common clinical problems; in some patients the gland dysfunction is immunologically mediated (Sjogren's syndrome), although in most, it is not. In all of the above circumstances, dynamic regulation of AQP5 expression could be an appropriate response to changes in surface liquid tonicity, perhaps as a mechanism for restoring lumenal osmolarity or maintaining cell volume. Additionally, identification of ERK as a necessary signaling component in this model provides the first example linking aquaporin expression to intracellular signaling pathways. Involvement of ERK or other MAP kinases will likely extend to other models in which aquaporin expression may be altered, for example with inflammation or oxidant stress. Identification of both the stimuli and signaling pathways that regulate aquaporin expression may provide insight into alterations in water transport seen in a wide array of pathophysiologic conditions. Aquaporin-5 (AQP5)1 is a mammalian water channel protein that is present in the apical plasma membrane of type I pneumocytes and submucosal glands of the respiratory tract, salivary and lacrimal gland epithelia, and corneal epithelium (1.Raina S. Preston G.M. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1908-1912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 2.Nielsen S. King L.S. Christensen B.M. Agre P. Am. J.

Aquaporins are important in the functions of these tissues. Radiation damaged salivary gland function has been partially restored by viral transfer of an aquaporin gene (4.Delporte C. O'Connell B.C. He X. Ambudkar I.S. Agre P. Baum B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22070-22075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and AQP5 knockout mice exhibit a reduction in saliva production (5.Ma T. Song Y. Gillespie A. Carlson E.J. Epstein C.J. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20071-20074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Studies of ontogeny and distribution suggest additional roles for AQP5 in lacrimation, regulation of corneal epithelial hydration, airway humidification, and generation or maintenance of the aqueous airway surface layer at multiple sites in the respiratory tract (2.Nielsen S. King L.S. Christensen B.M. Agre P. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1549-C1561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.King L.S. Nielsen S. Agre P. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1541-C1548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At each of the sites at which AQP5 is expressed, the composition or tonicity of the surface layers may be acutely altered under both normal (autonomic stimulation) and pathophysiological conditions; however, the effects of osmotic stress on AQP5 expression have not been examined. Investigation of osmotic stress in mammalian tissues has focused principally on the kidney, in which cells of the renal medulla may experience levels >1000 mosm in humans (6.Miyakawa H. Woo S.K. Chen C.P. Dahl S.C. Handler J.S. Kwon H.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F753-F761PubMed Google Scholar). In response to these hypertonic conditions, cells accumulate small organic molecules, such as betaine, myo-inositol, taurine, and sorbitol. These “compatible” osmolytes lower cellular ionic strength, protecting cells from the adverse effects of elevated intracellular salt concentrations (7.McManus M.L. Churchwell K.B. Strange K. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 333: 1260-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Several studies have demonstrated that genes involved in the synthesis or transport of compatible osmolytes are activated by hypertonic stress (8.Cowley B.D.J. Ferraris J.D. Carper D. Burg M.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: F154-F161PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Martial S. Price S.R. Sands J.M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1995; 5: 1971-1978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Miyai A. Yamauchi A. Moriyama T.

Likewise, dry eyes and mouth are common clinical problems; in some patients the gland dysfunction is immunologically mediated (Sjogren's syndrome), although in most, it is not. In all of the above circumstances, dynamic regulation of AQP5 expression could be an appropriate response to changes in surface liquid tonicity, perhaps as a mechanism for restoring lumenal osmolarity or maintaining cell volume. Additionally, identification of ERK as a necessary signaling component in this model provides the first example linking aquaporin expression to intracellular signaling pathways. Involvement of ERK or other MAP kinases will likely extend to other models in which aquaporin expression may be altered, for example with inflammation or oxidant stress. Identification of both the stimuli and signaling pathways that regulate aquaporin expression may provide insight into alterations in water transport seen in a wide array of pathophysiologic conditions. Discovery of the aquaporin family of water channel proteins has provided insight into molecular mechanisms of membrane water permeability. It is increasingly clear that aquaporins can be rate-limiting for water transport, as evidenced by recent demonstrations in the kidney (33.Deen P.M. Verdijk M.A. Knoers N.V. Wieringa B.

Chem. 1998; 273: 4296-4299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), lung (35.Bai C. Fukuda N. Song Y. Ma T. Matthay M.A. Verkman A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 555-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), and salivary glands (5.Ma T. Song Y. Gillespie A. Carlson E.J. Epstein C.J. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20071-20074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). However, with few exceptions, mechanisms regulating aquaporin expression remain poorly understood. These studies were undertaken to examine the effects of osmotic stress on expression of AQP5, an epithelial water channel found in the apical membrane of type I pneumocytes and submucosal glands in the respiratory tract, as well as in the apical membrane of salivary and lacrimal glands and corneal epithelium. In each of these locations, the osmolality of aqueous surface layers may vary in some circumstances. Here, we describe that in a lung epithelial cell line, as well as in rat tissues, AQP5 is up-regulated by hypertonic stress. Osmotic induction of AQP1 in a kidney cell line was recently described (36.Jenq W. Mathieson I.M. Ihara W. Ramirez G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The studies reported here provide the first example of osmotic induction of a nonrenal aquaporin, as well as the first demonstration that aquaporin expression can be regulated by the MAP kinase signaling cascade. Upon exposure to hyperosmotic stress, inorganic ions flow into cells, only to be replaced over several hours by organic osmolytes, such as betaine and myo-inositol (37.Burg M.B. Kwon E.D. Kultz D. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1598-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Although total DNA synthesis, RNA transcription, and protein synthesis decrease with osmotic stress (38.Cohen D.M. Wasserman J.C. Gullans S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: C594-C601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a limited number of genes have been identified that are up-regulated (37.Burg M.B. Kwon E.D. Kultz D. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1598-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 39.Blomberg A. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 1429-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Induction of the transporters and enzymes that facilitate accumulation of intracellular organic osmolytes has been the focus of intense investigation (37.Burg M.B. Kwon E.D. Kultz D. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1598-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Given the intimate relationship of solute and water transport, we explored whether aquaporin expression might also be affected by osmotic stress. AQP5 mRNA and protein were induced by hypertonic stress in MLE-15 cells. AQP5 mRNA expression peaked at 12 h, whereas protein expression peaked at 24 h, a time course similar to induction of organic solute transporters (40.Smardo F.L.J. Burg M.B. Garcia-Perez A. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C776-C782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When MLE-15 cells were incubated with hypertonic medium and then returned to isotonic conditions, AQP5 mRNA and protein expression fell nearly to baseline levels within hours, indicating that both expression and degradation may be tightly controlled. These studies provide the first link between aquaporin expression and a MAP kinase signaling cascade. MAP kinases have been implicated in a wide range of cellular events, from growth factor-mediated proliferation to numerous stress responses (41.Kultz D. Burg M. J. Exp. Biol. 1998; 201: 3015-3021Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42.Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2249) Google Scholar). We demonstrate selective activation of ERK by hypertonic stress in MLE-15 cells. This finding contrasts to previous studies in alveolar type II cells (31.Edwards Y.S. Sutherland L.M. Power J.H. Nicholas T.E. Murray A.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L670-L678PubMed Google Scholar) and inner medullary collecting duct cells (13.Berl T. Siriwardana G. Ao L. Butterfield L.M. Heasley L.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F305-F311PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Zhang Z. Yang X.Y. Cohen D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1104-C1112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in which all three MAP kinase cascades (ERK, JNK, and p38) are activated by osmotic stress. Incubation of cells with two distinct MEK inhibitors, U0126 and PD98059, prevented activation of ERK by hypertonic stress and dramatically blocked both AQP5 mRNA and protein induction. Neither basal nor hypertonically induced Na,K-ATPase expression was affected by these drugs, suggesting that these inhibitors are not globally affecting protein synthesis pathways. Although ERK activation is necessary for AQP5 induction in this model, activation of ERK by TPA did not increase AQP5 expression, either at baseline or following hypertonic stimulation, indicating that additional signaling steps are required. Signaling events both upstream and downstream from ERK in this model are currently under investigation. AQP5 was induced only when relatively impermeable solutes were added to the medium. This requirement for hypertonic, rather than simply hyperosmolar, stimulation provides some insight into upstream events, as it suggests that perturbation of the cell membrane or cytoskeleton may be necessary for induction to occur. Downstream ERK is known to activate several transcription factors, including Elk1, Ets1, c-Myc, Tal, and STAT, which then directly activate target genes (42.Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2249) Google Scholar). Our data suggest transcriptional activation of AQP5, because hypertonic stress increased AQP5 mRNA expression severalfold without increasing mRNA stability. This effect may not be direct, however, based both on the time course of induction (several hours required) and preliminary studies showing that cyclohexamide blocks hypertonic induction of AQP5 mRNA (data not shown). A recently identified hypertonicity-induced transcription factor, TonEBP (tonicity-responsive element-binding protein) (43.Miyakawa H. Woo S.K. Dahl S.C. Handler J.S. Kwon H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2538-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), is a candidate protein for the intermediate in this pathway. We have been unable to demonstrate activation of a 1.5-kilobase AQP5 proximal promoter by hypertonicity in preliminary experiments (data not shown); however, no tonicity response element consensus sites are present in this part of the promoter. Tonicity response elements have been identified as far as 50 kilobases upstream in the case of sodium-dependentmyo-inositol transporter (44.Rim J.S. Atta M.G. Dahl S.C. Berry G.T. Handler J.S. Kwon H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20615-20621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). We suspect that, in a similar fashion, relevant cis elements in the AQP5 promoter are outside of the 1.5-kilobase proximal promoter as well. We believe that these data strongly support potential in vivo relevance of this phenomenon for two reasons. First, surface liquid osmolalities have been demonstrated under some circumstances to reach 430–480 milliosmoles/kg in human nasal secretions (45.Anderson S.D. Togias A.G. Busse W.W. Holgate S.T. Asthma and Rhinitis. Blackwell Scientific, Boston1995: 1178-1195Google Scholar) and canine airway secretions (46.Man S.F. Adams G.K. Proctor D.F. J. Appl. Physiol. 1979; 46: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 47.Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Bromberg P.A. Gatzy J.T. J. Appl. Physiol. 1981; 50: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We observed a dose-response relationship for hypertonic induction of AQP5 beginning with as little as 25 mosm supplemental sorbitol, well within this range. Second, and more importantly, using previously described techniques for generating hyperosmolarity in vivo (22.Lohr J.W. McReynolds J. Grimaldi T. Acara M. Life Sci. 1988; 43: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), we show that AQP5 was induced in the lung, submandibular gland, and lacrimal gland of hyperosmolar rats when compared with isosmolar controls. Future investigation of this phenomenon in additional in vivomodels will allow more specific assessment of the role for hypertonic induction of AQP5 in different pathophysiologic conditions. With the recognition that aquaporins can be rate-limiting for water transport comes an increased need for understanding the mechanisms regulating their expression, as well as their relevance to human disease. Changes in the tonicity of airway surface liquid have been implicated in the pathophysiology of cystic fibrosis (48.Smith J.J. Travis S.M. Greenberg E.P. Welsh M.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 229-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar), as well as in some forms of exercise- or cold-induced asthma (45.Anderson S.D. Togias A.G. Busse W.W. Holgate S.T. Asthma and Rhinitis. Blackwell Scientific, Boston1995: 1178-1195Google Scholar, 49.Anderson S.D. J. Allergy Clin.

Although much more is known about the molecular identity and functions of targeted self-antigens, with few exceptions, evidence that autoantibodies to these targets have a particular function and contribute directly to the pathological process is lacking. Here we show that human autoantibodies reacting with the zinc fingers of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase involved in the recognition of damaged DNA totally prevent the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase by caspase-3, a process that normally occurs during early apoptosis. Furthermore, these antibodies, which are frequent in certain autoimmune rheumatic and bowel diseases, affect the characteristic features of apoptosis and increase cell survival ex vivo. This new observation is important, because failure to remove autoimmune or abnormal cells can give rise to prolonged autoimmune stimulation and tumor formation.

DNA breaks activate PARP, which in turn catalyzes the synthesis of poly(ADP-ribose) from its substrate, the respiratory coenzyme NAD+, at the site of breakage (1.de Murcia G. Ménissier de Murcia J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 172-176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar,2.Lindhal T. Satoh M.S. Poirier G.G. Klungland A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 405-411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). The ADP-ribose polymer is primarily attached to PARP itself (automodification) and to a few other acceptor proteins (heteromodification) involved in chromatin architecture and DNA metabolism, thus affecting their activity. The function of PARP is thought to be related to a number of nuclear processes that involve nicking and resealing of DNA strands, including transcription and DNA repair. PARP is probably associated with a multifunctional complex comprising factor x-ray cross-complementing-1, DNA polymerase β, and DNA ligase III, which are involved in the base excision repair pathway. PARP knock-out mice display a marked genomic instability and an extreme sensitivity to genotoxic agents (3.Ménissier-de Murcia J. Niedergang C. Trucco C. Ricoul M. Dutrillaux B. Mark M. Oliver J.

Oliver F.J. de Murcia G. Ménissier de Murcia J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2644-2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). PARP has a modular organization (1.de Murcia G. Ménissier de Murcia J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 172-176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar) comprising an N-terminal DNA binding domain, which acts as a molecular nick sensor and contains two zinc finger motifs called F1 and F2, which are involved in the recognition of DNA breaks during DNA repair (6.Gradwohl G. Ménissier de Murcia J. Molinete M. Simonin F. Koken M. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. de Murcia G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The presence of IgG antibodies reacting with the N-terminal F1 and F2 zinc fingers (7.Muller S. Briand J.P. Barakat S. Lagueux J. Poirier G.G. de Murcia G. Isenberg D.A. Clin. Immunol.

Invest. 1989; 83: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) has been described in the serum of patients with various systemic autoimmune diseases. In particular, a high prevalence of antibodies reacting with synthetic peptides corresponding to zinc fingers F1 and F2 (residues 18–59 and 122–165, respectively) was observed in patients with certain autoimmune rheumatic diseases (notably systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)) and autoimmune bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (8.Decker P.

Muller S. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1995; 77: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These antibodies are essentially of the IgG1 subclass and recognize the PARP protein in dot immunoassay. The possible pathogenic properties of PARP antibodies are unknown. With a few exceptions, this is the case of most autoantibodies characteristic of systemic autoimmune diseases. However, deposition of immune complexes containing anti-double-stranded DNA antibody subsets can induce renal failure (11.Suzuki N. Mihara S. Sakane T. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1033-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 12.Madaio M.P. Semin. Nephrol. 1999; 19: 48-56PubMed Google Scholar), these antibodies may also deposit directly on the glomerular basement membrane, inducing proteinuria (13.Ravirajan C.T. Rahman M.A. Papadaki L.

On the other hand, deposition of antibodies to Ro/SSA ribonucleoprotein in fetal cardiac tissues is thought to be associated with congenital heart block (14.Reichlin M. Brucato A. Frank M.B.

Circulation. 1999; 99: 1914-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and autoantibody subsets to ribosomal P proteins have been shown to be able to penetrate into live cells and cause cellular dysfunction (16.Koscec M. Koren E. Wolfson-Reichlin M. Fugate R.D. Trieu E. Targoff I.N. Reichlin M. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2033-2041PubMed Google Scholar). Because elevated rates of spontaneous and induced chromosomal damage have been reported in certain autoimmune rheumatic diseases (17.Bhusate L.L. Herbert K.E. Scott D.L. Perrett D. Ann. Rheum.

Prev. 1997; 21: 540-545PubMed Google Scholar) and SLE (20.Golan T.D. Foltyn V. Roueff A. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1991; 58: 289-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 21.Rosenstein B.S.

Rheum. 1994; 21: 851-856PubMed Google Scholar), we studied the possibility that autoantibodies to F1 and F2 zinc fingers inhibit the PARP catalytic activity and cause the observed pathogenic effects. We report here that, contrary to our first expectations, PARP antibodies from autoimmune patients do not significantly affect PARP activity but efficiently prevent caspase-3-mediated PARP cleavage during apoptosis and prolong cell survival, which can have important deleterious effects. Recombinant human PARP (rPARP) was produced as described previously (24.Giner H. Simonin F. de Murcia G. Ménissier-de Murcia J. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 114: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). PARP F2 peptide and 44–67 peptide of ribonucleoprotein SmD1 were synthesized and purified as described (7.Muller S.

Briand J.-P. Cantagrel A. Muller S. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The homogeneity of each peptide was checked by analytical high-performance liquid chromatography on a nucleosil C18 5-μm column (4.6 × 150 mm), using a linear gradient of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water and acetonitrile containing 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid. The identity of purified peptides was assessed by matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry using a Protein TOF apparatus (Bruker Spectrospin, Bremen, Germany). Antibodies contained in pooled sera from patients with SLE were affinity-purified on PARP F2 peptide or SmD1 44–67 peptide columns as described previously (26.Ricchiuti V. Pruijn G.J.M. Thijssen J.P.H. van Venrooij W.J. Muller S. J. Autoimmun. 1997; 10: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Rabbit antibodies to F2 (7.Muller S. Briand J.P. Barakat S. Lagueux J. Poirier G.G. de Murcia G. Isenberg D.A. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1994; 73: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) were affinity-purified on a PARP F2 peptide column, whereas normal IgGs were affinity-purified from pooled normal sera on a protein A column. From 1 ml of pooled patients' serum, 100–120 μg of F2 antibody were purified. Affinity-purified IgG antibodies were tested in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for their reactivity with PARP F2 and SmD1 44–67 peptides, as well as in a dot immunoassay on rPARP (7.Muller S. Briand J.P. Barakat S. Lagueux J. Poirier G.G. de Murcia G. Isenberg D.A. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1994; 73: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar,25.Dumortier H. Abbal M. Fort M. Briand J.-P. Cantagrel A. Muller S. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Subclasses of antibodies were determined using horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-human antibodies specific for IgG1 (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA; working dilution, 1:100), IgG2 (Nordic, Tilburg, The Netherlands; working dilution, 1:250), IgG3 (ICN; working dilution, 1:4,000), and IgG4 (ICN; working dilution, 1:1,000). Affinity-purified antibodies to PARP F2 peptide and SmD1 44–67 peptide were mostly of the IgG1 subclass. The human promyelocytic leukemia HL60 cells (1 × 105/ml) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. To study the effect of antibodies on apoptosis, HL60 cells were first preincubated at 37 °C with affinity-purified antibodies or normal IgG (5 μg of IgG/5 × 104 cells per well containing 100 μl of medium) or with buffer alone. After 6 h, 10 μl of RPMI medium containing 50 μg/ml actinomycin D were added for 18 h at 37 °C. Biochemical characterization of apoptosis was routinely assessed by DNA fragmentation analysis on a 1% agarose gel and by Western immunoblotting using the monoclonal antibody (mAb) C-2-10, which recognizes the 89-kDa apoptotic PARP fragment (27.Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2347) Google Scholar). Three hundred ng of rPARP were preincubated for 1 h at 37 °C with affinity-purified human autoantibodies or normal IgGs (molar ratio of rPARP/antibodies, 1:15). PARP digestion was achieved by adding 60 ng of purified, recombinant human caspase-3 (PharMingen, San Diego, CA; reference number 66281T) for 30 min at 37 °C in 10 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.2) containing 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP, 10 mm phosphocreatine, and 50 μg/ml creatine kinase. Samples were then subjected to electrophoresis on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. After saturation of the membrane with Tris-buffered saline containing Tween 20 and 5% nonfat milk, nitrocellulose sheets were incubated with mAb C-2-10 (supernatant diluted 1:50) or anti-caspase-3 rabbit antibodies (antiserum diluted 1:2,000; PharMingen; 65906E). Binding of antibodies to blotted proteins was revealed using horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies and the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech enhanced chemiluminescence immunoblotting reagent (RPN 2109). Cell pellets were resuspended in Hepes buffer containing 2.5 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI) and annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate (both from PharMingen). The fluorescence intensity was measured using a FACSCalibur apparatus and CELLQuest software (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Cell debris was excluded, and 5000 gated events were acquired. Early apoptotic cells are annexin V-positive and PI-negative, whereas late apoptotic cells are both annexin V- and PI-positive. Cell viability was evaluated by a microculture tetrazolium reduction assay using MTT (28.Carmichael J. DeGraff W.G. Gazdar A.F. Minna J.D. Mitchell J.B. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 936-942PubMed Google Scholar). Human autoantibodies are often capable of inhibiting in vitro the functional activity of the antigen they target. This has been shown, for example, in the case of autoantibodies to protein kinase NII, DNA topoisomerase I, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and tRNA synthetases (29.Tan E.M.

The possibility that autoantibodies to F2 inhibit in vitro the PARP catalytic activity was thus investigated using different assays previously designed to test the inhibiting properties of induced PARP mAbs (30.Lamarre D. Talbot B. de Murcia G. Laplante C. Leduc Y. Mazen A. Poirier G.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 950: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and chemical compounds (31.Decker P. Alves Miranda E. de Murcia G. Muller S. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 1169-1172PubMed Google Scholar). However, when compared with normal IgG, affinity-purified F2 autoantibodies from patients with SLE did not alter the activity of PARP significantly in any of these specific tests. It is interesting to note that Yamanaka et al. (9.Yamanaka H. Willis E.H. Carson D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 32.Yamanaka H. Willis E.H. Penning C.A. Peebles C.L. Tan E.M. Carson D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 900-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) showed that patients' antibodies directed to the C-terminal NAD binding domain efficiently inhibited the catalytic activity of PARP in vitro. This antibody reactivity, however, is seldom detected in patients' sera (33.Miura H. Yamanaka H. Misaki Y. Kato T. Mato T. Hirose N. Ito K. Nishioka K. Yamamoto K. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1994; 73: 290-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). One of the characteristics associated with the execution phase of the apoptosis pathway is the specific PARP cleavage by caspases. This cleavage leads to its inactivation, thus preventing futile DNA repair cycles (27.Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2347) Google Scholar). It has been identified that caspase-3 (CPP32, Yama, or apopain) is the most efficient processing enzyme for PARP (34.Tewari M. Quan L.T. O'Rourke K. Desnoyers S. Zeng Z. Beidler D.R. Poirier G.G. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 801-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2277) Google Scholar, 35.Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T., Yu, V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3796) Google Scholar). It cleaves PARP after the consensus sequence 211DEVD214 located in the nuclear localization signal domain, thus generating two apoptotic-specific fragments of M r 89 and 24 kDa, respectively (27.Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2347) Google Scholar, 34.Tewari M. Quan L.T. O'Rourke K. Desnoyers S. Zeng Z. Beidler D.R. Poirier G.G. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 801-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2277) Google Scholar). To determine whether autoantibodies reacting with the PARP F2 finger located in residues 122–165 may influence the level of PARP cleavage by caspase-3, we designed a new assay illustrated in Fig. 2 Ain which human rPARP was preincubated with affinity-purified F2 antibodies and subsequently allowed to react with active caspase-3. After incubation, the mixture was diluted in sample buffer and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. PARP fragments were analyzed by Western immunoblotting using the anti-PARP mAb C-2-10 to detect the typical apoptotic fragment 89K (27.Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2347) Google Scholar). As expected, in the absence of antibodies (Fig. 2 B, lane 2) or when normal human IgGs were incubated with rPARP before the addition of caspase-3 (Fig.2 B, lane 4), two fragments corresponding to the remaining intact PARP protein (116K) and the typical apoptotic 89K fragment were visualized. Most interestingly, however, when affinity-purified human antibodies to F2 were preincubated with rPARP, the apoptotic fragment 89K was not generated by caspase-3 (Fig. 2 B, lane 3). The same result was found with distinct pools of affinity-purified patient antibodies to F2 as well as in the presence of affinity-purified anti-F2 peptide antibodies raised in rabbits (results not shown). No cleavage inhibition was observed when we tested non-related rabbit Abs or normal rabbit IgGs. As additional control experiments, we checked that purified IgGs were not cleaved, and thus not used as a possible secondary substrate by caspase-3. Furthermore, we verified that none of the patients' and rabbit antibodies reacted with caspase-3 itself. These data univocally indicate that in vitro, autoantibodies to F2 from patients with SLE specifically hamper PARP cleavage. A direct inactivation of caspase-3 is certainly not involved in this observation. Anti-F2 antibodies most probably act by direct or induced steric hindrance in blocking the access of the DEVD↓G cleavage site to caspase-3. Because the specific proteolytic breakdown of PARP by caspases is known to occur during the executive phase of apoptosis, we further examined whether patient-derived anti-F2 antibodies may directly affect the apoptotic events in mammalian cells. We evaluated the number of apoptotic cells in a preparation of HL60 cells incubated either with affinity-purified anti-F2 autoantibodies or with antibodies from lupus patients purified on a column containing peptide 44–67 of nuclear SmD1 antigen (25.Dumortier H. Abbal M. Fort M. Briand J.-P. Cantagrel A. Muller S. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). These antibodies were used as control, because as antibodies to F2, they recognize a major epitope of a nuclear autoantigen, they were affinity-purified using a similar procedure, and they were extracted from lupus sera. It has to be noted that because patients' antibodies to PARP are mostly directed to F1 and F2, and that other linear autoepitopes have not been described in PARP (8.Decker P. Briand J.P. de Murcia G. Pero R.W. Isenberg D.A Muller S. Arthritis Rheum. 1998; 41: 918-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), autoantibodies that recognize other sites of the enzyme could not be included as other control. Antibody-preincubated cells were subjected to actinomycin D exposure to trigger apoptosis. Apoptosis was quantified by annexin V and PI staining and flow cytometry (36.Vermes I. Haanen C. Steffens-Nakken H. Reutelingsperger C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 184: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (4607) Google Scholar). Fig.3 shows a significant decrease in the number of annexin V- and PI-positive HL60 cells (late apoptosis) after incubation with F2 autoantibodies (Fig. 3, B–D). In this representative experiment, the number of late apoptotic cells was reduced by 30.2% (67.4 versus 97.6%) compared with the number of late apoptotic cells counted in the cell sample incubated with control lupus autoantibodies directed to peptide 44–67 of SmD1 (Fig. 3 E). We also used the MTT conversion assay (28.Carmichael J. DeGraff W.G. Gazdar A.F. Minna J.D. Mitchell J.B. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 936-942PubMed Google Scholar) to determine the total number of living HL-60 cells exposed first to F2 and control antibodies and then to actinomycin D. As shown in Fig.4, and in good agreement with the results in Fig. 3, the number of surviving cells was significantly increased when cells were incubated with F2 antibodies compared with the number of living cells in the sample incubated with control IgG from normal individuals. Using both the flow cytometry analysis and MTT assay, we found that anti-F2 antibodies have no effect on HL-60 cells that have not been subsequently induced to apoptosis. This result supports the idea that anti-F2 antibodies play no deleterious role on intact dividing cells but apparently only affect preapoptotic cells. The present study highlights the identification of a new, potentially pathogenic autoantibody population. Antibodies to PARP peptide F2 efficiently inhibit caspase-3-mediated PARP cleavagein vitro and prolong ex vivo survival of cell subsets undergoing apoptosis after exposure to actinomycin D. We have not expressly shown that human anti-F2 antibodies effectively enter living cells; however, the penetration of antibodies within the cells could be facilitated, because HL60 cells possess Fc receptors at their surface. In this regard, it is notable that purified F2 and SmD1 peptide antibodies were essentially of the IgG1 subclass, which is the IgG subclass showing the highest affinity for Fc receptors. Furthermore, whereas membrane integrity is not lost in the initial stages of apoptosis, cytoplasmic and nuclear membranes of apoptotic cells in the later stages are altered, and this may facilitate antibody penetration. Moreover, it has been shown that many autoantigens undergo a striking redistribution during apoptosis, becoming clustered and concentrated in the surface blebs of apoptotic cells (37.Casciola-Rosen L.A. Anhalt G. Rosen A. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1317-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar, 38.Rosen A. Casciola-Rosen L.A. Cell Death & Differ. 1999; 6: 6-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Among these autoantigens are nucleosomes, several ribonucleoproteins, certain ribosomal proteins, and PARP. It is possible that purified antibodies recognize PARP in apoptotic surface structures and that PARP itself mediates the penetration of anti-PARP autoantibodies, which then localize within preapoptotic cells. Our findings suggest that as a result of antibody binding to the F2 zinc finger, a functional site that is relatively near the apoptotic caspase-3 cleavage site (Fig. 1), the access of the DEVD↓G cleavage site by caspase-3 may become less easily available, and cells may be more resistant to cell death. It is notable that cells from PARP-deficient knock-out mice transfected with an uncleavable D214A PARP mutant present a significant apoptotic delay (39.Oliver F.J. de la Rubia G. Rolli V. Ruiz-Ruiz M.C. de Murcia G. Ménissier-de Murcia J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33533-33539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). Our finding, as well as the observation that in lupus patients the percentage of macrophages engulfing apoptotic cell material appears significantly reduced compared with control individuals (40.Herrmann M. Voll R.E. Zoller O.M. Hagenhofer M. Ponner B.B. Kalden J.R. Arthritis Rheum. 1998; 41: 1241-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar), might be of central importance in the etiopathogenesis of SLE. These phenomena may lead to an increase in the circulation or in certain compartments of both persistent nonapoptotic and apoptotic cells that contain biochemically modified self-antigens (41.Utz P.J. Anderson P. Arthritis Rheum. 1998; 41: 1152-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Experiments are presently being performed to analyze the morphological and immunogenic properties of this persistent and probably abnormal material in vivoand to determine whether the accumulation of certain cell subsets that would normally have been eliminated may contribute both to the local inflammatory process and to the B- and T-cell autoimmune response itself. We thank G. de Murcia for the human recombinant PARP and mAb C-2-10."
https://openalex.org/W2061706372,"NF-kappa B plays a pivotal role in normal T-cell activation and may also mediate human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV)-induced T-cell transformation. Activation of NF-kappa B by both T-cell costimulatory signals and the HTLV Tax protein involves stimulation of I kappa B kinase (IKK). As a genetic approach to dissect the intermediate steps involved in NF-kappa B activation in human T cells, we performed somatic cell mutagenesis to isolate signaling-defective mutant Jurkat T-cell lines. One of the mutant cell lines was shown to have a specific blockade in the IKK signaling pathway but remained competent in the c-Jun N-terminal kinase and MAP kinase pathways. Interestingly, this mutant cell line lacks expression of IKK gamma, a non-catalytic component of the IKK complex. Expression of exogenous IKK gamma in the mutant cells restored NF-kappa B activation by both the T-cell costimulation agents and Tax. These findings provide genetic evidence for the requirement of IKK gamma in NF-kappa B signaling triggered by both T-cell costimulatory signals and HTLV-I Tax protein."
https://openalex.org/W1987047793,"CD34 and podocalyxin are structurally related sialomucins, which are expressed in multiple tissues including vascular endothelium and hematopoietic progenitors. These glycoproteins have been proposed to be involved in processes as diverse as glomerular filtration, inhibition of stem cell differentiation, and leukocyte-endothelial adhesion. Using homologies present in the cytoplasmic tails of these proteins, we have identified a novel member of this family, which we designate endoglycan. This protein shares a similar overall domain structure with the other family members including a sialomucin domain, but also possesses an extremely acidic amino-terminal region. In addition, endoglycan contains several potential glycosaminoglycan attachment sites and is modified with chondroitin sulfate. Endoglycan mRNA and protein were detected in both endothelial cells and CD34+ bone marrow cells. Thus, CD34, podocalyxin, and endoglycan comprise a family of sialomucins sharing both structural similarity and sequence homology, which are expressed by both endothelium and multipotent hematopoietic progenitors. While the members of this family may perform overlapping functions at these sites, the unique structural features of endoglycan suggest distinct functions for this molecule.

Structurally, the extracellular region of each of these molecules is dominated by an amino-terminal mucin-like domain, which is densely substituted with sialylated O-linked carbohydrates. This extensive glycosylation causes mucin domains to adopt an extended, rodlike structure (1.Li F. Erickson H.P. James J.A. Moore K.L. Cummings R.D. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6342-6348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 2.Cyster J.G. Shotton D.M. Williams A.F. Embo J. 1991; 10: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The mucin-like region is followed by a cysteine-containing and presumably globular domain. This domain may fold into an immunoglobulin-like structure as the positions of 2 of the cysteines are conserved in the C2 set of the immunoglobulin superfamily (3.Barclay A.N. Barkay M.L. Brown M.H. Beyers S.J. Somoza C. Williams A.F. The Leukocyte Antigen Facts Book. Academic Press Inc., San Diego1993Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domains of these proteins are 73–76 amino acids in length and highly conserved between species orthologs. It is also in this region that the highest homology between CD34 and podocalyxin is found (4.Sassetti C. Tangemann K. Singer M.S. Kershaw D.B. Rosen S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1965-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). CD34 is expressed by multipotent hematopoietic progenitors, but is lost during differentiation and is not present on mature hematopoietic cells (5.Andrews R.G. Singer J.W. Bernstein I.D. Blood. 1986; 67: 842-845Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Katz F.E. Tindle R. Sutherland D.R. Greaves M.F. Leukemia Res. 1985; 9: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 7.Civin C.I. Strauss L.C. Brovall C. Fackler M.J. Schwartz J.F. Shaper J.H. J. Immunol. 1984; 133: 157-165PubMed Google Scholar). This property makes CD34 a useful marker for the identification and purification of progenitor cells. CD34+ cells isolated from bone marrow or cord blood are clinically important, since a small number of such cells are able to reconstitute hematopoiesis after myeloablative therapy (8.Krause D.S. Fackler M.J. Civin C.I. May W.S. Blood. 1996; 87: 1-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of CD34 in an immature hematopoietic cell line has been shown to inhibit its differentiation (9.Fackler M.J. Krause D.S. Smith O.M. Civin C.I. May W.S. Blood. 1995; 85: 3040-3047Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that one possible function for CD34 is to maintain the undifferentiated phenotype of progenitor cells. The chicken ortholog of podocalyxin, known as thrombomucin, is also expressed on multipotent hematopoietic progenitors as well as thrombocytes (10.McNagny K.M. Pettersson I. Rossi F. Flamme I. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Graf T. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1395-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and rat podocalyxin is found on platelets (11.Miettinen A. Solin M.L. Reivinen J. Juvonen E. Väisänen R. Holthöfer H. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 813-822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Podocalyxin was originally described as the major sialoprotein on the podocytes of the kidney glomerulus. At this site, podocalyxin is concentrated on the interdigitating secondary foot processes of these cells, where it is thought to maintain the filtration slits between these processes via charge repulsion (12.Kerjaschki D. Sharkey D.J. Farquhar M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1591-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The importance of the podocyte's anionic character has been demonstrated by neutralization experiments using either polycations or desialylation. Either treatment disrupts the glomerular filter and induces proteinurea (13.Andrews P.M. Kidney Int. 1979; 15: 376-385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 14.Seiler M.W. Venkatachalam M.A. Cotran R.S. Science. 1975; 189: 390-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In addition to these sites, CD34 and podocalyxin are both broadly expressed on the luminal surface of vascular endothelium (15.Fina L. Molgaard H.V. Robertson D. Bradley N.J. Monaghan P. Delia D. Sutherland D.R. Baker M.A. Greaves M.F. Blood. 1990; 75: 2417-2426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Kershaw D.B. Beck S.G. Wharram B.L. Wiggins J.E. Goyal M. Thomas P.E. Wiggins R.C. J. Biol.

Invest. 1986; 78: 1142-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The function of these mucins on unactivated endothelium is not clear, but when properly glycosylated in high endothelial venules (HEV),1 -1 both can function as ligands for the leukocyte adhesion molecule, l-selectin (4.Sassetti C. Tangemann K. Singer M.S. Kershaw D.B. Rosen S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1965-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 18.Baumheter S. Singer M.S. Henzel W. Hemmerich S. Renz M. Rosen S.D. Lasky L.A. Science. 1993; 262: 436-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). HEV are specialized postcapillary venules present in lymph nodes and Peyer's patches, which support the recruitment of blood-borne lymphocytes into the lymphoid tissue (19.Girard J.P. Springer T.A. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 449-457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). The adhesion between lymphocytes and HEV is initiated by the lectin domain ofl-selectin binding to carbohydrates presented by specific endothelial ligands (20.Rosen S.D. Bertozzi C.R. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 261-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Since all of the biochemically defined HEV-expressed ligands for l-selectin are sialomucins (4.Sassetti C. Tangemann K. Singer M.S. Kershaw D.B. Rosen S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1965-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar,21.Puri K.D. Finger E.B. Gaudernack G. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), it is likely that the ability of these structures to present multivalent carbohydrate ligands to the clustered lectin domains ofl-selectin is critical for the formation of a high avidity interaction. Thus, podocalyxin and CD34 are capable of promoting lymphocyte-endothelial adhesion when appropriate glycoforms are expressed by HEV, but these proteins are implicated in different specialized functions at other sites (i.e. anti-adhesion in the case of podocalyxin on podocytes, and inhibition of differentiation in the case of CD34 on hematopoietic cells). Therefore, these two related sialomucins appear to be multifunctional proteins whose function depends, at least in part, on tissue-specific glycosylation. Using homologies present in CD34 and podocalyxin, we have identified a third member of this gene family. This protein shares a similar overall structure with the other family members except for the presence of an extremely acidic amino-terminal domain. As is the case for CD34 and podocalyxin, this protein is detected in both endothelial cells and early hematopoietic progenitors. Due to its endothelial expression and extensive glycosylation, which includes a sialomucin domain and glycosaminoglycan chains, we propose the name endoglycan for this novel gene. We collectively refer to this gene family as the “CD34 family.” Rapid Screen human fetal brain cDNA library was purchased from Origene (Rockville, MD). 96 pools of approximately 5000 clones each were screened by PCR using the following primers based on an EST corresponding to mouse endoglycan: sense,ATGAATTCGTGATCATTGGTGTCATCTGCTTCATCATCAT; antisense,ATGGATCCCACGTCCAGCGTGGGATTGTCGTG (all of the underlined sequences specified in this section were added for cloning purposes and are not present in the endoglycan cDNA). The same screen was then applied to 96 subpools of 100 clones, each derived from two of the positive pools, and then to individual clones from a positive subpool. In this way a partial clone was obtained, which corresponded to bases 227–2269 in the sequence of Fig. 1. This sequence was used to identify a human EST, which corresponded to bases 104–386. In order to obtain a full-length clone, the same fetal brain library was rescreened along with a human placenta library (Origene) using the following primers, which amplify the extreme 5′ end of the human EST sequence: sense, GCTGGGTCTGATGAGCCTGG; antisense, TAGTGTCTTCAATGGAACCTGC. Positive pools were then rescreened with the same antisense primer and a vector primer (vector primer 3, Origene) in order to identify the longest clone. Screening of subpools was performed, as above, resulting in isolation of a clone from the brain library with the sequence shown in Fig. 1. Multiple-tissue Northern blots were purchased from CLONTECH, hybridized with an endoglycan probe, stripped, and rehybridized with a β-actin probe. The endoglycan probe consisted of bases 1013–1525, which had been amplified from a cDNA clone by PCR using the following primers: sense, ATAGGATCCGAGCCTCTTCCCCACTGGCC; antisense,ATAGAATTCTCAGAGCGTGCCGTAGTCGCTGC. The β-actin probe was supplied with the blots. Randomly primed probes were labeled with [32P]dATP using a Strip-EZ DNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Hybridization and washing was performed as recommended by the blot manufacturer. The final wash was performed in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C. Blots were stripped using the Strip-EZ DNA kit (Ambion). HUVEC for Northern blot analysis were isolated from umbilical cords (San Francisco General Hospital) following published procedures (22.Jaffe E.A. Nachman R.L. Becker C.G. Minick C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (6019) Google Scholar) except that collagenase A (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used. HUVEC were grown in EGM medium (Clonetics, Walkersville, MD), and mRNA was isolated using Oligotex Direct kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). 5 μg of mRNA was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel and transferred to Hybond N+ filters (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Blots were hybridized as above with an endoglycan probe consisting of bases 1–592 that had been excised from the cDNA clone by restriction digestion with EcoRI and BamHI. HUVEC for RT-PCR experiments were purchased from Clonetics and grown according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Total RNA was prepared using RNAzol B (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX). First-strand cDNA was prepared from 2 μg of RNA primed with random hexamers using AMV-RT (Life Technologies, Inc.). A 141-bp endoglycan cDNA fragment was amplified from HUVEC cDNA using the primers based on the murine endoglycan sequence given above. A 420-bp podocalyxin cDNA fragment was amplified using the following primers: sense,ATGAATTCGTGATCATTGGTGTCATCTGCTTCATCATCAT; antisense,ATGGATCCCACGTCCAGCGTGGGATTGTCGTG. 45 cycles of PCR were performed on cDNA corresponding to 20 ng of input RNA using Advantage cDNA polymerase (CLONTECH). Cryopreserved CD34+ bone marrow cells were purchased from Poietics (Gaithersburg, MD). cDNA was prepared from total RNA extracted from 50,000 cells, as above. A 519-bp endoglycan fragment and a 289-bp HPRT fragment were amplified using the following primers: for endoglycan, sense (ATAGGATCCGAGCCTCTTCCCCACTGGCC) and antisense (ATAGAATTCTCAGAGCGTGCCGTAGTCGCTGC); for HPRT, sense (CCTGCTGGATTACATCAAAGCACTG) and antisense (TCCAACACTTCGTGGGGTCCT). 35 cycles of PCR were performed on cDNA corresponding to 2000 input cells. The resulting DNA was electrophoresed on 1% agarose and visualized with ethidium bromide. IgG fusion proteins were constructed by PCR amplification of bases 9–1511 (EG/IgG) or 9–638 (AD/IgG) of human endoglycan, bases 262–1127 of human CD34, or bases 551–1531 of human podocalyxin. The following primers were used: endoglycan sense (ATAGCTAGCGGCACGAGGACCATGGGC), EG/IgG antisense (ATATGATCAACTTACCTGTGTCGCTGCGCACCTGGCTGG), AD/IgG antisense (ATATGATCAACTTACCTGTAAAGTCACGGACCTGAGGC), CD34 sense (ATAAAGCTTCTGGTCCGCAGGGGCGCGC) and antisense (ATAAAGCTTACTTACCTGTGGTCTTTTGGGAATAGCTC), and podocalyxin sense (ATATCTAGACTGAGGCGACGACACGATGC) and antisense (ATAGGATCCACTTACCTGTGCGGTCCTCGGCCTCCTCC) (underlined sequence contains restriction sites and a 3′ splice donor site). These fragments were cloned into the XbaI and BamHI sites of pEF-BOS (23.Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar). A cDNA fragment encoding the Fc domain of human IgG1 containing the 5′ splice acceptor site (excised from pIg (24.Simmons D.L. Hartley D.A. Cellular Interactions in Development: A Practical Approach.

The control IgG construct was made by amplifying the Igκ-signal peptide (bases 837–1013 of pSec-Tag2A, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) with the following primers: sense (ATATCTAGACCCACTGCTTACTGGCTTATCG) and antisense (ATAGGATCCACTTACCTGTGCTCGGTACCAAGCTTCGTACG), and cloning this fragment into the XbaI and BamHI sites upstream of the human IgG Fc cDNA in pEF-BOS. COS-7 cells were transfected with these plasmids using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). After transfection, cells were cultured in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 200 μCi of Na235SO4 (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) for 48 h. 1 mm4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-xyloside (Sigma) in Me2SO (0.1% final concentration) was added to the “β-d-xyloside”-treated cells. Fusion proteins were isolated by incubating aliquots of conditioned medium with 10 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Repligen, Cambridge, MA) for 2 h at 4 °C. Precipitates were washed with PBS, eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, boiled for 3 min, and electrophoresed on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Gels were stained with Gel Code Blue (Pierce), destained, incubated with Fluorohance (Research Products International Corp, Mount Prospect, IL) for 30 min, and dried for fluorography. HUVEC (Clonetics) were grown to ∼75% confluence in two 180-cm2 flasks as recommended. Cells were then washed with PBS and cultured for 16 h in sulfate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% dialyzed fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 1 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 12 μg/ml bovine brain extract (Clonetics), 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 2 mCi of Na235SO4. Labeled cells were washed with PBS and lysed in PBS containing 2% Triton X-100, 5 mmEDTA, and “Complete” protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × gfor 10 min and precleared by incubation with protein A-Sepharose for 30 min at 4 °C. Aliquots of the supernatant were then incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with protein A-Sepharose, which had been bound with 5 μg of affinity-purified anti-endoglycan antibody or normal rabbit IgG (Sigma). 50 μg/ml heparin (Sigma) was included in the precipitation to prevent nonspecific interactions with labeled heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Precipitates were then washed with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100. For enzyme digestions, labeled glycoproteins bound to protein A-Sepharose were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in 100 μl of PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and different combinations of the following: 200 milliunits of chondroitinase ABC, 10 milliunits of heparinase I, 10 milliunits of heparinase III (Seikagaku America Inc, Ijamsville, MD), and 3 μl ofO-sialoglycoprotein endopeptidase (Cedarlane Labs Ltd., Hornby, Ontario, Canada). Precipitates were washed once more and electrophoresed as above. A fusion protein consisting of the predicted extracellular domain of endoglycan (bases 9–1511) fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST; bases 258–917 of pGEX-2T vector, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was constructed in the PEAK10 vector (Edge Biosystems, Gaithersburg, MD). The endoglycan fragment was amplified by PCR using the following primers: sense (ATAAAGCTTGGCACGAGGACCATGGGC) and antisense (ATAGATATCGCGGAGCCCCTGGGCACCAGGTCGCTGCGCACCTGGCTGG), and cloned into the HindIII and EcoRV sites. The GST cDNA was amplified using: sense (ATACACGTGGACGATGACGATAAGATGTCCCCTGTACTAGGTTATTGGAA) and antisense (ATAGCGGCCGCTCAATCCGATTTTGGAGGATGGTC), and cloned into the PmlI and NotI sites. (Underlined sequences contain restriction sites and encode protease cleavage sites) The fusion protein was produced in PEAK-Rapid cells (derived from human embryonic kidney) as recommended by the manufacturer. The secreted fusion protein was bound to glutathione-agarose (Sigma), washed with PBS, and eluted with 5 mm reduced glutathione (Sigma) in PBS. The eluate was concentrated with a Centricon 30 microconcentrator (Amicon, Beverly, MA) and used to immunize two rabbits (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL). Antibodies were affinity-purified by chromatography on a column of endoglycan/GST fusion protein coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose (Sigma) according to standard procedures (25.Harlow E. Lane D. Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999Google Scholar). A cDNA encoding the AD/IgG fusion protein was transfected into COS-7 cells with LipofectAMINE, and cells were cultured in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. The conditioned medium was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and Tris, pH 8.0, and sodium azide were added to final concentrations of 50 mm and 0.02%, respectively. This material was bound to a protein A-Sepharose column, which was then washed with PBS and eluted with 100 mm triethylamine. The eluate was neutralized with 1/10 volume of 3 m Tris, pH 6.8, and concentrated in a Centricon 30 microconcentrator (Amicon). 45 μg of purified protein was subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE, electroblotted onto Problott (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The predominant 70-kDa band was excised and subjected to Edman degradation analysis. CHO cells expressing individual members of the CD34 family members were created by transfection with each cDNA using LipofectAMINE. Human endoglycan cDNA (bases 1–2081) or human podocalyxin cDNA (bases 235–1858) were transfected using the PEAK10 vector (Edge Biosystems). Human CD34 cDNA (bases 262–1350) in the pRK5 vector (26.Eaton D.L. Wood W.I. Eaton D. Hass P.E. Hollingshead P. Wion K. Mather J. Lawn R.M. Vehar G.A. Gorman C. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 8343-8347Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) was cotransfected with empty PEAK10 vector. CHO transfectants were selected with puromycin (Edge Biosystems), and individual clones were screened for expression by flow cytometry. Cells (CHO or HUVEC) were removed from culture dishes by treatment with 0.6 mm EDTA in PBS (without Ca2+ and Mg2+) for 20 min at room temperature. For staining with rabbit antibodies, cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml affinity-purified anti-endoglycan antibody or normal rabbit IgG (Sigma) in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma), 2% normal goat serum, and 0.2% sodium azide (staining buffer). Cells were washed and stained with 10 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) in staining buffer. Staining with mouse monoclonal antibodies to CD34 (clone 581, Immunotech, Westbrooke, ME) or podocalyxin (clone PHM5, provided by Dr. Robert Atkins, Monash Medical Center, Victoria, Australia) was identical except the staining buffer contained 2% normal rabbit serum instead of goat serum, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) was used as a secondary reagent. Cryopreserved CD34-positive bone marrow cells were purchased from Poietics and stained as above, except the staining buffer contained 2% mouse serum and 2% human serum, and phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-CD34 (clone 581; Caltag, South San Francisco, CA) or mouse IgG1 (Caltag) were used. Peripheral blood was obtained by venipuncture and stained as above. Leukocyte subsets were identified with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies to CD14, CD19, CD4, and CD8 (Caltag) and αIIbβ3 (Immunotech). All samples were analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Specimens of human foreskin were obtained from the Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco and frozen in OCT embedding medium (Miles Inc., Elkhart, IN). 10-μm frozen sections were cut and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. Endogenous peroxidase activity was then quenched with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 20 min. Sections were blocked with PBS containing 1% goat serum and 1% human serum (staining buffer). Anti-endoglycan and anti-PECAM (monoclonal antibody 2148, Chemicon, Temecula, CA) antibodies were used at 1 μg/ml in staining buffer. Bound antibodies were detected with Cy 3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and Cy 2-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) in staining buffer. Normal rabbit IgG (Caltag) or mouse IgG1 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) were used as controls. The highest sequence homology between CD34 and podocalyxin occurs in the cytoplasmic domains of these proteins. In order to identify additional members of this gene family, we searched (tblastx) (27.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar) the GenBank expressed sequence tag (EST) library using the peptide sequence of the cytoplasmic domain of human podocalyxin as a probe. Several overlapping mouse EST sequences were identified encoding a peptide sequence that was 44% identical to a 113-amino acid region encompassing the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of podocalyxin. In order to obtain a full-length human cDNA corresponding to this gene, PCR primers were designed based on the available mouse sequence, which would be predicted to amplify a product corresponding to the human ortholog of this gene but not to the two known family members. This approach took advantage of the observation that the transmembrane domains of CD34 and podocalyxin differ from each other, but are highly conserved between species orthologs (16.Kershaw D.B.

Chem. 1995; 270: 29439-29446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thus, one primer was based on sequence in the predicted transmembrane domain and the other was based on a region in the cytoplasmic tail, which is conserved between this protein and podocalyxin (HDNPTLDV, see Fig. 8). These primers amplified the same sized product from mouse and human cDNA libraries and were used to screen a human fetal brain cDNA library by the strategy described under “Experimental Procedures.” One full-length and one partial clone (bases 227–2269) were obtained and sequenced (Fig. 1). The full-length cDNA contains a single open reading frame, encoding a protein of 605 amino acids, followed by a 3′-untranslated region of 322 bp and a poly(A) tail. The start codon identified is in a strong context for translation initiation (31.Kozak M. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar) and is followed by a hydrophobic region of 32 amino acids, which satisfies the criteria for a cleavable signal peptide (32.Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4942) Google Scholar). Hydropathy analysis (33.Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17296) Google Scholar) of the derived amino acid sequence predicted a single transmembrane domain of 25 residues near the carboxyl terminus. Overall, the cDNA encodes a type I transmembrane protein with a similar domain structure to CD34 and podocalyxin. The 80-amino acid cytoplasmic domain is similar in length to the other family members (73 for CD34 and 76 for podocalyxin) and shares significant homology with both (58% identity with human podocalyxin and 33% with human CD34). The 500-amino acid extracellular region contains a membrane-proximal, cysteine-containing and presumably globular domain. This domain is similar to those found in the other family members, except that only three cysteines are present as compared with six and four in CD34 and podocalyxin, respectively. Amino-terminal to this structure is a domain of 156 amino acids, which contains 36% serine, threonine, and proline. This is twice the average content of these residues in human proteins (34.Doolittle R.F. Of Urfs and Orfs. University Science Books, Mill Valley, CA1986Google Scholar) and is characteristic of mucin-like domains. At the amino terminus of the predicted protein is a highly acidic domain of 161 amino acids (after signal peptide cleavage), which contains 30% acidic residues and is not found in the other family members. This domain is particularly rich in glutamate, containing three polyglutamate tracts of 5–11 residues. Inspection of the sequence revealed many potential sites for post-translational modification (Fig. 1). In addition to the denseO-linked carbohydrate expected to be present in the mucin-like domain, four potential sites of N-linked carbohydrate addition are present. The two tyrosines in the acidic amino-terminal domain are potential sites of sulfation (35.Bundgaard J.R. Vuust J. Rehfeld J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21700-21705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Six serine-glycine and two serine-alanine pairs, which are potential glycosaminoglycan attachment sites (36.Esko J.D. Zhang L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), are distributed throughout the extracellular region. Intracellularly, two potential sites for casein kinase II phosphorylation ((S/T)XX(D/E)) are found. The product of this cDNA will be referred to as endoglycan, based on the characterization provided below. Northern blots containing poly(A)+ RNA from different human tissues were probed with a fragment of the endoglycan cDNA. A major 2.5-kb band was detected in several tissues. This mRNA was most prominent in brain but was a"

We have now cloned the cDNA of the mouse C4ST on the basis of the amino acid sequences of peptides obtained from the purified enzyme by protease digestion. This cDNA contains a single open reading frame that predicts a protein composed of 352 amino acid residues. The protein predicts a Type II transmembrane topology. The predicted sequence of the protein contains all of the known amino acid sequence and four potential sites for N-glycosylation, which corresponds to the observation that the purified C4ST is an N-linked glycoprotein. The amino acid sequence of mouse C4ST showed significant sequence homology to HNK-1 sulfotransferase. Comparison of the sequence of mouse C4ST with human HNK-1 sulfotransferase revealed ∼29% identity and ∼48% similarity at the amino acid level. When the cDNA was introduced in a eukaryotic expression vector and transfected in COS-7 cells, the sulfotransferase activity that catalyzes the transfer of sulfate to position 4 of GalNAc residue of both chondroitin and desulfated dermatan sulfate was overexpressed.

Characterization and molecular cloning of sulfotransferases, which participate in the formation of the defined structure of chondroitin sulfate, are important to clear the functional roles of chondroitin sulfate.We have purified chick chondroitin 6-sulfotransferase (C6ST), which catalyzes transfer of sulfate to position 6 ofN-acetylgalactosamine residue of chondroitin from PAPS (24.Habuchi O.

Uronosyl 2-sulfotransferase, which sulfates iduronyl and glucuronyl residues in dermatan/chondroitin sulfate, has been cloned (26.Kobayashi M. Sugumaran G. Liu J. Shworak N.W. Silbert J.E.

We have previously purified chondroitin 4-sulfotransferase (C4ST), which catalyzes the transfer of sulfate from PAPS to position 4 of N-acetylgalactosamine residue of chondroitin, to apparent homogeneity (27.Yamauchi S.

This enzyme was also found to catalyze the sulfation of partially desulfated dermatan sulfate. In this paper we report the cloning of the cDNA encoding mouse C4ST and the expression of it in COS-7 cells.DISCUSSIONWe have cloned a cDNA that encodes the C4ST. The predicted sequence of the protein contains all of the known amino acid sequence and four potential N-linked glycosylation sites. When the cDNA was introduced into a eukaryotic expression vector and transfected in COS-7 cells, the C4ST activity was overexpressed. The predicted protein showed no significant sequence homology with other sulfotransferases except for HNK-1 sulfotransferase. C4ST transfers sulfate to position 4 of GalNAc residue, whereas HNK-1 sulfotransferase transfers sulfate to position 3 of nonreducing terminal GlcA residue. Although acceptor substrate specificity is quite different from each other, C4ST and HNK-1 sulfotransferase seem to belong to a common sulfotransferase family.Two putative PAPS biding sites were found by x-ray crystallography of estrogen sulfotransferase performed in the presence of adenosine 3′, 5′-bisphosphate (36.Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.G. Carter C.W. Negishi M. Pedersen L.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 904-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar): one is KSGT for 5′-phosphosulfate binding site and another is RX 7S for 3′-phosphate binding site. These motifs were observed in every glycosaminoglycan sulfotransferases so far cloned except for heparan sulfateN-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase, in which the 3′-phosphate binding site is not RX 7S but IX 7S (37.Hashimoto Y. Orellana A. Gil G. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15744-15750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the predicted mouse C4ST, these motifs were observed; K125VACT for 5′-phosphosulfate binding site and R186EPFERLVS for 3′-phosphate binding site. It is of note that Cys is present in 5′-phosphosulfate binding site. C4ST was found to require sulfhydryl compounds for the activity. The presence of Cys in the 5′-phosphosulfate binding motif may relevant to the requirement for sulfhydryl compounds.Some inconsistency in amino acid sequence was observed between peptides obtained from the purified rat C4ST and the predicted mouse C4ST; Arg in peptide 5 and Gln in peptide 6 were changed to Gln and Gly, respectively, in the predicted mouse C4ST. Since peptide 3 adjacent to the carboxyl side of peptide 5 was obtained after trypsin digestion, Arg in peptide 5 must be correct, and the change of Arg to Gln in peptide 5 may reflect the difference between rat C4ST and mouse C4ST. In contrast, it is unlikely that change of Gln to Gly in peptide 6 is due to the species variation, because this change should not be attained after single point mutation. It is most probable that we made an error in the assignment of amino acid residue of peptide 6.The amino-terminal sequence contains three in-frame ATG codons. When the sequence surrounding the first ATG codon is compared with the eukaryotic consensus translation sequence (38.Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2794) Google Scholar), the purine at −3, is conserved, but Gly in position +4 is not conserved. The sequence surrounding the second and the third ATG codon (Met9 and Met11 in Fig. 2 A) also partially fits with the consensus sequence; position −3 of the ATG codon is Gly, whereas position +4 is not Gly but Ala. It remains to be determined which ATG codons could function as the initiation codon.The amino-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified rat C4ST was found in the predicted stem domain. Although we have not determined the whole sequence of the rat C4ST yet, this observation suggests that the purified rat C4ST might be released from the chondrosarcoma cells after proteolytic cleavage at the site, because the amino acid sequence of the mouse C4ST agreed well with that of the rat C4ST as far as determined. C6ST (25.Fukuta M. Uchimura K. Nakashima K. Kato M. Kimata K. Shinomura T. Habuchi O. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 9208-9213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) were also cleaved at the NH2-terminal region before secretion in the culture medium. The mechanism as well as physiological significance of the proteolytic cleavage of these sulfotransferases remains to be determined.The message of C4ST was expressed mainly in the brain and kidney. Various chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans have been reported to be present in the brain such as neurocan (40.Rouch U. Karthikeyan L. Maurel P. Margolis R.U. Margolis R.K. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 26876-26882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). On the other hand, rat mesangial cells were shown to synthesize various proteoglycans, including versican, biglycan, and decorin (45.Thomas G.J. Shewring L. MacCarthy K.J. Couchman J.R. Mason R.M. Davies M. Kidney Int. 1995; 48: 1278-1289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Ligand forl-selectin in the kidney was shown to be versican (19.Kawashima H. Li Y.F. Watanabe N. Hirose J. Hirose M. Miyasaka M. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 393-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). C4ST may be involved in the control of the function of these proteoglycans via the sulfation of glycosaminoglycan chains of these proteoglycans.Although both C4ST and C6ST utilize chondroitin as a common acceptor substrate, no significant homology in the amino acid sequence was observed between the two sulfotransferases. In addition, expression pattern of the cDNAs of these two sulfotransferases in the mouse tissues are quite different; C4ST expressed mainly in the brain and kidney, whereas a strong message of C6ST was observed in the lung and spleen (46.Uchimura K. Kadomatsu K. Fan Q.-W. Muramatsu H. Kurosawa N. Kaname T. Yamamura K. Fukuta M. Habuchi O. Muramatsu T. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 489-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It is thus possible that biosynthesis of chondroitin 4-sulfate and chondroitin 6-sulfate may be controlled by different mechanisms by which the expression of these two sulfotransferases are regulated. 4-Sulfated glycosaminoglycans (chondroitin 4-sulfate and dermatan sulfate) are synthesized in most tissues, whereas C4ST mRNA was expressed mainly in the brain and kidney among various mouse tissues, suggesting that multiple forms of C4ST may be present in the tissues. Unexpectedly, C4ST showed significant homology in the amino acid sequence with HNK-1 sulfotransferase. Oligosaccharides containing 3-O-sulfated GlcA, which was structurally related to the proteoglycan linkage region, have been found in the culture medium of human fibroblast (47.Shibata S. Takagaki K. Nakamura T. Izumi J. Kojima K. Kato I. Endo M. J. Biol.

It remains to be determined whether C4ST may share not only amino acid sequence but also substrate specificity with HNK-1 sulfotransferase. Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans are found in various tissues as molecules having divergent molecular architecture (1.Kjellén L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev.

Chondroitin sulfate chains attached to chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans appear to play important roles in the formation and maintenance of cartilage tissue, because undersulfation of chondroitin sulfate resulted from the defective synthesis of PAPS1(3.Pennypacker J.P.

Chondroitin sulfates have sulfate group at various positions of the component sugars; position 6 and/or 4 of GalNAc residues and position 2 or 3 of GlcA residues. The pattern of sulfation of chondroitin sulfate chains varies with the source of the proteoglycans, development of animal (20.Kimata K. Okayama M. Oohira A. Suzuki S. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1973; 1: 211-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 21.Habuchi H. Kimata K. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1031-1040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Kitagawa H.

Sorrell J.M. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11389-11396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that sulfate moieties attached to the specific position of the component sugars may be related to the specific function of the glycosaminoglycan. Characterization and molecular cloning of sulfotransferases, which participate in the formation of the defined structure of chondroitin sulfate, are important to clear the functional roles of chondroitin sulfate. We have purified chick chondroitin 6-sulfotransferase (C6ST), which catalyzes transfer of sulfate to position 6 ofN-acetylgalactosamine residue of chondroitin from PAPS (24.Habuchi O. Matsui Y. Kotoya Y. Aoyama Y. Yasuda Y. Noda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21968-21974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and cloned its cDNA (25.Fukuta M. Uchimura K. Nakashima K. Kato M. Kimata K. Shinomura T. Habuchi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18575-18585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Uronosyl 2-sulfotransferase, which sulfates iduronyl and glucuronyl residues in dermatan/chondroitin sulfate, has been cloned (26.Kobayashi M. Sugumaran G. Liu J. Shworak N.W. Silbert J.E. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10474-10480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We have previously purified chondroitin 4-sulfotransferase (C4ST), which catalyzes the transfer of sulfate from PAPS to position 4 of N-acetylgalactosamine residue of chondroitin, to apparent homogeneity (27.Yamauchi S. Hirahara Y. Usui H. Takeda Y. Hoshino M. Fukuta M. Kimura J.H. Habuchi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2456-2463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This enzyme was also found to catalyze the sulfation of partially desulfated dermatan sulfate. In this paper we report the cloning of the cDNA encoding mouse C4ST and the expression of it in COS-7 cells. DISCUSSIONWe have cloned a cDNA that encodes the C4ST. The predicted sequence of the protein contains all of the known amino acid sequence and four potential N-linked glycosylation sites. When the cDNA was introduced into a eukaryotic expression vector and transfected in COS-7 cells, the C4ST activity was overexpressed. The predicted protein showed no significant sequence homology with other sulfotransferases except for HNK-1 sulfotransferase. C4ST transfers sulfate to position 4 of GalNAc residue, whereas HNK-1 sulfotransferase transfers sulfate to position 3 of nonreducing terminal GlcA residue. Although acceptor substrate specificity is quite different from each other, C4ST and HNK-1 sulfotransferase seem to belong to a common sulfotransferase family.Two putative PAPS biding sites were found by x-ray crystallography of estrogen sulfotransferase performed in the presence of adenosine 3′, 5′-bisphosphate (36.Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.G. Carter C.W. Negishi M. Pedersen L.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 904-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar): one is KSGT for 5′-phosphosulfate binding site and another is RX 7S for 3′-phosphate binding site. These motifs were observed in every glycosaminoglycan sulfotransferases so far cloned except for heparan sulfateN-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase, in which the 3′-phosphate binding site is not RX 7S but IX 7S (37.Hashimoto Y. Orellana A. Gil G. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15744-15750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the predicted mouse C4ST, these motifs were observed; K125VACT for 5′-phosphosulfate binding site and R186EPFERLVS for 3′-phosphate binding site. It is of note that Cys is present in 5′-phosphosulfate binding site. C4ST was found to require sulfhydryl compounds for the activity. The presence of Cys in the 5′-phosphosulfate binding motif may relevant to the requirement for sulfhydryl compounds.Some inconsistency in amino acid sequence was observed between peptides obtained from the purified rat C4ST and the predicted mouse C4ST; Arg in peptide 5 and Gln in peptide 6 were changed to Gln and Gly, respectively, in the predicted mouse C4ST. Since peptide 3 adjacent to the carboxyl side of peptide 5 was obtained after trypsin digestion, Arg in peptide 5 must be correct, and the change of Arg to Gln in peptide 5 may reflect the difference between rat C4ST and mouse C4ST. In contrast, it is unlikely that change of Gln to Gly in peptide 6 is due to the species variation, because this change should not be attained after single point mutation. It is most probable that we made an error in the assignment of amino acid residue of peptide 6.The amino-terminal sequence contains three in-frame ATG codons. When the sequence surrounding the first ATG codon is compared with the eukaryotic consensus translation sequence (38.Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2794) Google Scholar), the purine at −3, is conserved, but Gly in position +4 is not conserved. The sequence surrounding the second and the third ATG codon (Met9 and Met11 in Fig. 2 A) also partially fits with the consensus sequence; position −3 of the ATG codon is Gly, whereas position +4 is not Gly but Ala. It remains to be determined which ATG codons could function as the initiation codon.The amino-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified rat C4ST was found in the predicted stem domain. Although we have not determined the whole sequence of the rat C4ST yet, this observation suggests that the purified rat C4ST might be released from the chondrosarcoma cells after proteolytic cleavage at the site, because the amino acid sequence of the mouse C4ST agreed well with that of the rat C4ST as far as determined.

Oligosaccharides containing 3-O-sulfated GlcA, which was structurally related to the proteoglycan linkage region, have been found in the culture medium of human fibroblast (47.Shibata S. Takagaki K.

In this report, we identified the Gβγ binding motif and G-protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK2) phosphorylation sites in the M3-MR i3 loop via a strategy of deletional and site-directed mutagenesis. The Gβγ binding domain was localized to Cys289–His330 within the M3-MR-Arg252–Gln490 i3 loop, and the binding properties (affinity, influence of ionic strength) of the M3-MR-Cys289–His330 i3 loop subdomain were similar to those observed for the entire i3 loop. Site-directed mutagenesis of the M3-MR-Cys289–His330 i3 loop subdomain indicated that Phe312, Phe314, and a negatively charged region (Glu324–Asp329) were required for interaction with Gβγ. Generation of the full-length M3-MR-Arg252–Gln490 i3 peptides containing the F312A mutation were also deficient in Gβγ binding and exhibited a reduced capacity for phosphorylation by GRK2. A similar, parallel strategy resulted in identification of major residues (331SSS333 and348SASS351) phosphorylated by GRK2, which were just downstream of the Gβγ binding motif. Full-length M3-MR constructs lacking the 42-amino acid Gβγ binding domain (Cys289–His330) or containing the F312A mutation exhibited ligand recognition properties similar to wild type receptor and also effectively mediated agonist-induced increases in intracellular calcium following receptor expression in Chinese hamster ovary and/or COS 7 cells. However, the M3-MRΔCys289–His330 and M3-MR(F312A) constructs were deficient in agonist-induced sequestration, indicating a key role for the Gβγ-M3-MR i3 loop interaction in receptor regulation and signal processing.

The existence of such a complex is suggested by the detection of multimeric forms of G-protein subunits or receptors (1.Coulter S. Rodbell M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The dynamics of such a complex are not understood, and it is not known whether such a complex is preformed and stabilized by agonist binding to receptor or whether the agonist initiates the formation of a signal transduction complex de novo. As an initial approach to identify components of this putative signal transduction complex, we designed two experimental systems. One strategy was based upon initial observations in our laboratory concerning the transfer of signal from R to G and focused on a functional readout involving G-protein activation (9.Sato M. Kataoka R. Dingus J. Wilcox M. Hildebrandt J.D. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15269-15276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 10.Sato M. Ribas C.

This approach resulted in the partial purification and characterization of the NG108-15 G-protein activator and the “activators of G-protein signaling” group of proteins that activated heterotrimeric G-protein signaling pathways in the absence of a typical receptor (10.Sato M.

Lanier S.M. Duzic E. Nature Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 878-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). A second experimental approach utilized protein interaction technology to identify proteins that might exist within a putative signal transduction complex (20.Wu G. Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17836-17842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 21.Wu G. Benovic J.L. Hildebrandt J.D. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7197-7200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We initially focused on the large i3 loop of muscarinic receptors (MRs) and α2-adrenergic receptors and used these domains as probes to screen bovine brain cytosol for interacting proteins. The first interacting protein identified by this approach was brain arrestin. The interaction of arrestins with G-protein-coupled receptors is a key component of signal termination. The properties of arrestin binding to the i3 peptides were identical to those observed for an intact agonist-activated G-protein-coupled receptor (20.Wu G. Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17836-17842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The latter observation is consistent with the hypothesis that when the large i3 loop is expressed free of the conformational constraints imposed by membrane spans, it assumes a conformation similar to that attained with receptor activation (20.Wu G. Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17836-17842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The identification of arrestin as one of the cytosolic proteins interacting with the i3 peptide receptor subdomain underscores the potential utility of this experimental approach to identify additional interacting proteins that may contribute to the formation of a signal transduction complex. Subsequently, we extended this series of studies to evaluate the interaction of the i3 loop of M2- and M3-MR1 with brain G-protein. This work led to the surprising observation that Gβγ directly interacted with the i3 loop of the M2- and M3-MRs (21.Wu G. Benovic J.L. Hildebrandt J.D. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7197-7200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The binding of Gβγ to the i3 loop was inhibited by Gα and was required for effective phosphorylation of the i3 loop by the receptor kinase GRK2. In this report, we identified the amino acid residues in the M3-MR i3 loop required for Gβγ binding and phosphorylation by GRK2. Full-length M3-MR lacking Gβγ binding motifs did not internalize in response to agonist, further indicating functionality of the Gβγ-M3-MR i3 loop interaction. These observations are particularly interesting relative to a possible role for Gβγ as an adaptor protein in receptor trafficking and other aspects of signal processing. Heterotrimeric G-protein and Gβγ subunits were purified from bovine brain as described previously (21.Wu G. Benovic J.L. Hildebrandt J.D. Lanier S.M. J. Biol.

Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 457-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Antisera to the carboxyl-terminal 10 amino acids of Gβ1, which recognize Gβ1–4, were generated as described (28.Makhlouf M. Ashton S.H. Hildebrandt J.D. Mehta N. Gettys T.W. Halushka P.V. Cook J.A.

Onoraro J.J. Benovic J.L. Receptor. 1993; 3: 39-55PubMed Google Scholar). Peptides corresponding to amino acids Gly308–Asp334 and Ser335–Ile356 of the M3-MR were synthesized without amino or carboxyl modifications and purified by Biosynthesis Inc. (Lewisville, TX). The full-length rat M3-MR was kindly provided by Dr. Tom Bonner (Laboratory of Cell Biology, NIMH, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Quinuclidinyl benzilate (l-[benzilic-4,4′-3H] (3H-QNB)) and scopolamine methyl chloride ([N-methyl-3H] (3H-NMS)) were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Probenecid, carbachol and atropine were purchased from Sigma. Fluo-3 AM ester and pluoronic acid were purchased from Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene, OR). Superfect reagent was from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). LipofectAMINE and Geneticin were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. All other materials were obtained as described elsewhere (20.Wu G.

The constructs encoding the full-length M3-MR i3 peptide Arg252–Gln490 and the i3 loop subdomains Lys369–Thr424, Ser335–Leu368, Arg252–Asp334, Arg252–Ser288, and Cys289–His330 were generated by DNA amplification using the polymerase chain reaction and inserted into theBamHI and EcoRI restriction sites of the pGEX-4T-1 vector. The constructs encoding M3-MR i3 loop amino acids Arg252–Gln389 and Val390–Gln490 were generated from the Arg252–Gln490 construct by taking advantage of a PstI restriction site as described previously (20.Wu G. Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17836-17842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The M3-MR i1 (Lys93–Tyr104), i2 (Asp164–Lys182), and carboxyl-terminal (Asn547–Leu589) domains were generated as described previously (21.Wu G. Benovic J.L. Hildebrandt J.D. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7197-7200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). All mutations were made using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). GST fusion proteins were expressed in bacteria and purified on a glutathione-Sepharose matrix as described previously (21.Wu G. Benovic J.L. Hildebrandt J.D. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7197-7200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). GST and GST fusion proteins were eluted from the resin with 10 mmglutathione and subsequently concentrated/desalted by ultrafiltration prior to use in protein interaction and phosphorylation assays (21.Wu G. Benovic J.L. Hildebrandt J.D. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7197-7200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The full-length rat M3-MR in pCD2 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (forward primer, 5′-GCGAAGATCTACCATGACCTTGCACAGT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GGAATTCTCTAGACTACAAGGCCTGCTC-3′), restricted withBglII/EcoRI, and ligated into pBlueBacHis2 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for subsequent processing. The full-length M3-MR construct lacking the Gβγ binding domain was generated from the pBlueBacHis2.M3-MR construct as follows. The Met1–Cys289 segment was amplified with the same forward primer initially used for insert transfer from pCD2 and the reverse primer 5′-CCTTTAATCTAGAACTGCCTGTGGGGTG-3′. The receptor segment from His330 to the carboxyl terminus was amplified with the forward (5′-GAGTCTAGATCAAGCAGCAGCGACAG-3′) and reverse (5′-GATGAATTCCTACAAGGCCTGCTCCG-3′) primers. The amplified products Met1–Cys289 and His330–Leu589 were digested with proteinase K treatment prior to extraction and digestion withBglII/XbaI and XbaI/EcoRI, respectively. The two amplified products were then ligated into pBlueBacHis2 and subsequently into pcDNA3 for mammalian cell expression. The structure of each construct used in the present study was verified by nucleotide sequence analysis (Medical University of South Carolina DNA sequencing core). Binding of Gβγ to GST-M3-MR subdomain fusion proteins was carried out as described previously (21.Wu G. Benovic J.L. Hildebrandt J.D. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7197-7200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Briefly, GST fusion proteins (∼ 5 μg) were incubated with Gβγ in a total volume of 250 μl of Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.6 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 70 mm NaCl, 0.01% Thesit) at 4 °C for 40 min with gentle rotation. 25 μl of glutathione-Sepharose slurry (50%) was added, and incubation was continued for an additional 20 min. The resin was washed three times with 0.5 ml of Buffer A, and the retained proteins were solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer for denaturing gel electrophoresis (10% polyacrylamide). Polyvinylidene difluoride membrane transfers were evaluated by immunoblotting with anti-Gβ antibody. In each experiment, the membrane transfers used for immunoblotting were evaluated for the relative amounts and quality of GST fusion proteins by either immunoblotting with anti-GST antibody or amido black staining of proteins to control for sample processing in individual experiments. Unless stated otherwise, the concentration of Gβγ used in the protein interaction assays was 30 nm. The incubation conditions for phosphorylation reactions were essentially as described previously (21.Wu G. Benovic J.L. Hildebrandt J.D. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7197-7200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction was carried out in a total volume of 50 μl of buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 2 mm EDTA, 7 mm MgCl2, 300 μm phosphatidylinositol, 140 mm NaCl, and 50 nm GRK2) containing Gβγ (120 nm) and the GST-M3-MR subdomain fusion proteins (40–80 nm) unless indicated otherwise. Under these incubation conditions, the stoichiometry of phosphorylation was 0.8–1.5 mol of phosphate/mol of peptide for the full-length M3-MR i3 loop. Reactions were initiated by addition of 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (500–1000 cpm/pmol), incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and terminated by the addition of 50 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer and subsequent electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The gels were dried and exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film for 1–12 h. Phosphorylated species were cut from the dried gels, and substrate phosphorylation was quantitated by liquid scintillation spectrometry. COS 7 cells were grown on Falcon Primeria dishes at 37 °C (5% CO2) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose (4.5 g/liter), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum plus penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and fungizone (0.25 μg/ml). CHO cells were grown on Falcon tissue culture dishes at 37 °C (5% CO2) in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum plus penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and fungizone (0.25 μg/ml). For transient receptor expression, COS 7 or CHO cells at 70–80% confluency (100-mm dish) were transfected with 10 μg of M3-MR, M3-MRΔCys289–His330, or M3-MR(F312A) in pcDNA3 by the DEAE-dextran method (30.Lanier S.M. Downing S. Duzic E. Homcy C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10470-10478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or using Superfect reagent (Qiagen) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were harvested for membrane preparation 72 h after transfection for analysis in competition and saturation binding studies as described previously (30.Lanier S.M. Downing S. Duzic E. Homcy C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10470-10478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To generate cell lines stably expressing the receptor constructs, CHO cells in six-well plates (∼70% confluent) were transfected with 5 μg of M3-MR, M3-MRΔCys289–His330, or M3-MR(F312A) in pcDNA3 and 2 μg of pMT.neo. Cells were washed twice with serum-free medium and incubated for 3 h with 2 ml of serum-free medium containing DNA and 10 μl of LipofectAMINE. Cells were then washed and incubated with fresh serum-containing medium for 24 h, after which the dish was split 1:6 in six-well plates, and cells were propagated in the presence of G418 (0.5 mg/ml). Stable transfectants were screened for receptor expression by radioligand binding. Several individual cell lines expressing a range of receptor densities were established and characterized for each receptor construct. Saturation binding studies were analyzed by the RADLIG data analysis software (version 4, Biosoft) in which EBDA incorporates nonlinear curve fitting. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μm atropine. At radioligand concentrations near the K d, specific binding of 3H-QNB in membrane preparations represented 80–90% of total binding. To evaluate receptor-effector coupling, we determined the ability of agonist to increase intracellular calcium following transient and stable expression of M3-MR, M3-MRΔCys289–His330, or M3-MR(F312A) in CHO cells using the fluorometric imaging plate reader system (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA) (31.Schroeder K.S.

The instrument included a 6 W argon ion laser (Coherent Inc., Santa Clara, CA), a scanner with a proprietary optical system, an integrated 96-tip pipettor (to add test agents from two separate microplates), a temperature controller, and a CCD camera. The entire system was controlled by a Windows NT-based software interface. The 488 nm argon line at ∼300 mW laser power was used as an excitation source. Stable CHO transfectants or transiently transfected CHO cells (24 h following transfection) were seeded (∼50,000 cell/150μl/well) in 96-well clear-bottomed black microplates (Corning Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) 18 h before the experiments. On the day of assay, 25 μl aliquots (one for each microplate) of 2 mm Fluo-3 AM ester (Molecular Probes Inc.) in dimethyl sulfoxide were mixed with an equal volume of 20% pluronic acid and then diluted with Hanks' balanced salt solution (without phenol red; Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm probenecid, and 1% fetal bovine serum. The final Fluo-3 concentration in the dye-loading buffer was 4 μm. Cells were dye-loaded for 1 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator by replacing the growth medium with 100 μl of the dye-loading buffer. Cells were then washed four times with loading buffer lacking dye on a Danley plate washer and transferred to the fluorometric imaging plate reader system. During a data run, cells in different wells were exposed to different concentrations of carbachol, and the system recorded fluorescent signals for all 96 wells simultaneously in subsecond range intervals. Increases in intracellular calcium were observed as sharp peaks above the basal fluorescent levels typically 10 s after carbachol additions. The peak values (heights) were determined and normalized to basal levels to correct for any uneven laser light distribution or difference in cell density. Negative control corrections were made to cancel out effects of the temperature/laser power fluctuations or possible dye leaks. The peak values for each plate were finally normalized to the maximal signals observed at maximally effective (∼1 mm) concentrations of carbachol. In each experiment, the data point for any agonist concentration was an average from 4–6 wells. The M3-MR, M3-MRΔCys289–His330, and M3-MR(F312A) transfectants were all evaluated on the same day, and there was no discernable difference in the maximum fluorescent signal peak elicited by 1 mm carbachol in the three groups of transfectants. Carbachol (1 mm) did not elicit any increase in fluorescent signal in control cells transfected with vector alone. Agonist-induced internalization of receptor was determined by measuring cell surface receptors with the muscarinic receptor ligand3H-NMS as described previously (33.Moro O. Lameb J. Sadée W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6862-6865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Bogatkevich G.S. Lenz W. Jakobs K.H. van Koppen C.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 424-429PubMed Google Scholar). For COS 7 cells, one 100-mm dish was split to two six-well dishes 24 h after transfection, and incubation was continued for 24 h prior to initiating receptor internalization studies. Stable CHO transfectants were split from one confluent 100-mm dish to two 24-well dishes 24 h prior to initiating receptor internalization studies. For each series of experiments, confluent 6- or 24-well plates were incubated with the muscarinic agonist carbachol (1 mm) or vehicle in duplicate for various time periods (15–120 min) at 37 °C. Cells were placed on ice and washed three times with 2 ml (6-well plates) or three times with 0.5 ml (24-well plates) of cell washing solution (137 mm NaCl, 2.6 mm KCl, 1.8 mmKH2PO4, 10 mmNa2HPO4) at 4 °C and incubated with the muscarinic (plasma membrane-impermeable) antagonist 3H-NMS (2 nm) in the presence or absence of atropine (10 μm) at 4 °C for 4 h. Cells were then washed three times with 2 ml (six-well plates) or three times with 0.5 ml (24-well plates) of cell washing solution at 4 °C, and 0.5 ml of cell washing solution containing 1% Triton X-100 was added to each well. Cells were scraped, transferred to vials containing 3.5 ml of Ecoscint A (National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA) for analysis by scintillation spectrometry. Under these experimental conditions, total 3H-NMS binding in intact cells ranged from 3000 to 11,000 dpm in COS7 transfectants or from 8000 to 12,000 for CHO transfectants for each receptor construct, depending upon the cell density. In all experiments with intact cells, nonspecific binding defined in the presence of 10 μmatropine ranged from 300 to 500 dpm. We reported previously the direct interaction of Gβγ with the i3 loop of the M2-MR and M3-MR, the requirement of this interaction for phosphorylation of the i3 peptide by the receptor kinase GRK2, and the interaction of these three proteins within a ternary complex (21.Wu G. Benovic J.L. Hildebrandt J.D. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7197-7200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We initiated a series of experiments to identify the Gβγ binding site in the i3 peptide, its spatial relationship to residues phosphorylated by GRK2, and the role of this domain in signal processing. We first asked whether GRK2 phosphorylated intracellular domains of the M3-MR other than the i3 loop. Only the i3 loop of the receptor was phosphorylated by GRK2 (Fig.1 A and B, left panel), and this observation parallels the protein interaction data previously published (21.Wu G. Benovic J.L. Hildebrandt J.D. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7197-7200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) indicating that Gβγ also did not interact with the i1, i2, or carboxyl-terminal region of the M3-MR. Both the interaction of Gβγ with the M3-MR i3 loop and GRK2-mediated phosphorylation of the i3 loop preferred a Gβγ subunit free of Gα (Fig. 1 B, right panel), consistent with the concept that the interaction of Gβγ with the M3-MR i3 peptide and its putative role in positioning GRK2 on its substrate is dependent upon receptor-G-protein activation. We then prepared and evaluated receptor subdomain constructs from the i3 loop in Gβγ binding and phosphorylation assays (Fig.1 C). The M3-MR i3 loop contains 53 Ser/Thr residues, and there are 6 Ser/Thr-rich regions (285SSRSCSS291,315TTKS318, 331SSS333,348SASS351,439TSDTNSS445, and449TTAT452) (Fig.2 A). Both the Gβγ binding domain and the primary GRK2 phosphorylation sites are found in the amino-terminal half of the M3-MR i3 loop (Fig.1 C). Phosphorylation of the amino-terminal half of the i3 loop (Arg252–Gln389) was comparable to that of the entire i3 loop. There are four Ser/Thr-rich motifs in the Arg252–Gln389 segment of the i3 loop (Ser285–Ser291, Thr31"

Buchner J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 205-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). In reconstituted systems, Hsp90 prevents protein aggregation (8.Miyata Y. Yahara I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8123-8129Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and assists protein (re)folding (9.Wiech H. Buchner J. Zimmermann R. Jakob U. Nature. 1992; 358: 169-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 10.Shue G. Kohtz D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2707-2711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in an ATP-independent manner. However, a requirement for ATP was described for the in vivo function of yeast Hsp90 (11.Panaretou B. Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4829-4836Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar, 12.Obermann W.M.J. Sondermann H. Russo A.A. Pavletich N.P. Hartl F.U. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Recently Rutherford and Lindquist (13.Rutherford S.L. Lindquist S. Nature. 1998; 396: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar) proposed that Hsp90 normally suppresses the expression of genetic variation affecting morphogenic pathways, possibly at the level of protein folding. It is thus suggested that even transient decreases in Hsp90 levels resulting from its titration by stress-damaged proteins could unmask cryptic variants able to stimulate evolutionary change. We previously showed that Hsp90, upon heat treatment, could bind partially unfolded proteins, such as dihydrofolate reductase and firefly luciferase, and prevent their irreversible aggregation (14.Yonehara M. Minami Y. Kawata Y. Nagai J. Yahara I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2641-2645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). While Hsp90 by itself was not sufficient to mediate refolding of the captured luciferase, addition of reticulocyte lysate (RL)1 reactivated its catalytic activity (14.Yonehara M. Minami Y. Kawata Y. Nagai J. Yahara I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2641-2645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). This indicated that Hsp90 maintained thermally denatured proteins in a refolding-competent state. Upon heat shock of mammalian cells, the pool of pre-existent Hsc70, a mammalian cytosolic Hsp70, was shown to migrate to the nucleus (15.Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1986; 46: 959-961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). Thus chaperones other than Hsc70 may be implicated in the capture of heat-inactivated cytosolic proteins. Our results were consistent with this idea and we therefore proposed that induction of a novel chaperone activity of pre-existing Hsp90 by heat might be indispensable for protection of the cytosolic proteins against acute thermal damages, prior to induction of heat-shock proteins, which include Hsp90 itself (14.Yonehara M. Minami Y. Kawata Y. Nagai J. Yahara I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2641-2645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). However, the molecular events linking Hsp90-initiated prevention of protein aggregation and its final refolding of the substrate proteins remained unclear. Here we demonstrate a new role of Hsc70 and Hsp40, a mammalian cytosolic homolog of DnaJ, in the reactivation process of thermally denatured luciferase. Freeman and Morimoto (16.Freeman B.C. Morimoto R.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2969-2979Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar) first suggested that Hsp90 was able to maintain β-galactosidase in a refoldable state and furthermore, they showed that both Hsc70 and Hdj1(Hsp40) directly mediated its refolding to the native state under their experimental conditions. However, in our hands, using luciferase as a substrate, we determined that despite the presence of both Hsc70 and Hsp40, its reactivation still required a fraction of RL. This suggested that a third component in the RL may also be necessary for full accomplishment of the refolding process. We here report the identification of PA28, an activator of the 20 S proteasome, as a required cofactor working in concert with Hsc70 and Hsp40 during substrate refolding. Previously, PA28 had been characterized as a component which enhanced the peptidase activity of the 20 S proteasome in an ATP-independent manner, without directly affecting the degradation of proteins or of ubiquitin-protein conjugates (17.Chu-Ping M. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10515-10523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Dubiel W. Pratt G. Ferrell K. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22369-22377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PA28 is a hexameric ring-shaped complex composed of two subunits, PA28α and PA28β (19.Song X. Mott J.D. von Kampen J.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5651-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In vivo, a role of PA28 in antigen processing has been suggested (22.Dick T.P. Ruppert T. Groettrup M. Kloetzel P.M.

Cell. 1998; 92: 367-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). Since no homolog of PA28 has been found in yeast, PA28 may have a specific function in higher eukaryotes (25.Baumeister W. Walz J. Zühl F. Seemüller E. Cell. 1998; 92: 367-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). Here our results suggest that PA28 not only serves as an activator of the peptidase activity of 20 S proteasome as shown previously, but also plays a critical role as a cofactor which functions in concert with Hsc70 and Hsp40 during the Hsp90-dependent protein refolding. Porcine Hsp90, bovine Hsc70, and recombinant human Hsp40 were purified as described (26.Koyasu S. Nishida E. Kadowaki T. Matsuzaki F. Iida K. Harada F. Kasuga M. Sakai H. Yahara I. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The Sephacryl S-300 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) fractions were subjected to Q-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column purification. The PA28-containing fractions were combined with the purified 20 S proteasome and concentrated by ultrafiltration followed by desalting through a PD-10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biochem). This partially purified PA28-20 S proteasome complex was further subjected to hydroxyapatite (Bio-Gel HTP; Bio-Rad) chromatography to separate PA28 from the 20 S proteasome, followed by a second Sephacryl S-300 chromatography. Bovine 20 S proteasome was purified as described (29.Tanaka K. Yoshimura T. Kumatori A. Ichihara A. Ikai A. Nishigai M. Kameyama K. Takagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16209-16217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Firefly luciferase (Sigma) was thermally inactivated for 5 min at 45 or 50 °C, or for 10 min at 42 °C at a final concentration of 0.26 μm in 30 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2, 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) solution containing either Hsp90 or bovine serum albumin (BSA) as indicated. For refolding assays, thermally inactivated luciferase was diluted 10-fold into refolding buffer (10 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2, 50 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT) containing the indicated components. Rabbit RL was obtained from Promega. The approximate concentrations of chaperones in RL are reported to be: Hsp90, 2 μm; Hsc70, 2∼4.2 μm; Hsp40, 0.15 μm (30.Frydman J. Nimmesgern E. Ohtsuka K.

Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1089-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Aliquots (2 μl) were withdrawn from the reaction mixtures after incubation for 30 min, 1, or 1.5 h as indicated at 30 °C and mixed with a Promega luciferase assay system (40 μl). Luciferase activities were immediately measured by a Bio-Orbit 1253 luminometer and expressed as the percentage of the activity before thermal inactivation. The heterobifunctional cross-linker 2-[6-(biotinamido)-2-(p-azidobenzamido)-hexanoamido]ethyl-1,3′-dithiopropionate (Sulfo-SBED) (Pierce) was attached to luciferase via sulfonatedN-hydroxysuccinimido (Sulfo-NHS) ester. The modified luciferase (∼0.2 μm) was thermally inactivated in the presence of Hsp90 (11 μm) and diluted into refolding buffer (−DTT) containing the indicated components to initiate refolding as described above. After photolysis at 312 nm for 5 min, the reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min with 50 mm DTT to allow transfer of biotin-tag. The reaction mixtures were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Biotinylated proteins were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin and chemiluminescence reagents (NEN Life Science Products Inc.) after a transfer to a polyvinyidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). Luciferase (0.1 μm) was mixed with either Hsp90 or BSA as indicated in refolding buffer. Aggregation was monitored by measuring the turbidity of the mixtures at 320 nm for 20 min at 45 °C by a Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Ultrospec 3000 UV/Vis spectrophotometer equipped with a thermostat holder. Luciferase (0.26 μm) was mixed in a refolding buffer with Hsp90 (12 μm) or BSA (12 μm), and incubated for 5 min at 45 °C. As a control, luciferase alone was incubated in the same way and then Hsp90 (12 μm) was added to the reaction. Proteinase K (Stratagene) treatment was performed for 10 min at 0 °C at 0–10 μg/ml and was stopped by adding phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to 2 mm (32.Martin J. Langer T. Boteva R. Schramel A.

Nature. 1992; 356: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using anti-luciferase antibodies (Biogenesis). Rabbit RL was diluted with a buffer solution (HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA) and ultracentrifuged to remove ribosomes. For reactivation assay, samples were concentrated 2–5-fold with Microcon-10 (Amicon) and mixed with Hsc70 (5.3 μm) and Hsp40 (2.2 μm) in refolding buffer containing ATP (3 mm). Finally, thermally denatured luciferase preincubated in the presence of Hsp90 was added and mixed. Activities were measured at 30 min or 1 h. RL was applied to a DEAE-cellulose (DE-52; Whatman) column and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–500 mm KCl in the same buffer. Fractions containing the activity were pooled and subjected sequentially to 40, 60, and 80% saturation of ammonium sulfate. The 40–60% ammonium sulfate fraction that contained activity was applied to a Sephacryl S-300 column. A peak activity was eluted on a hydroxyapatite column with a linear gradient of 10–250 mmpotassium phosphate (pH 7.5). Finally pooled fractions from hydroxyapatite were diluted and applied to a Q-Sepharose column, followed by elution with a gradient of 100–500 mm KCl in 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5. After Q-Sepharose chromatography, the 30-kDa protein band was recovered from Coomassie-stained polyacrylamide gels and subjected to digestion with lysylendopeptidase (Wako, Japan). Recovered peptide fragments were sequenced as described (34.Kawasaki H. Emori Y. Suzuki K. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 191: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Appropriate fractions in each step described above were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using anti-peptide antibodies against human PA28α and PA28β (35.Ahn J.Y. Tanahashi N. Akiyama K.

Hemoglobin was removed from RL by passing it through a DEAE-cellulose column chromatography to yield “fraction II” (36.Ciechanover A. Hod Y. Hershko A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 81: 1100-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Fraction II equivalent to 20 μl of original RL was mixed with 20 μl of antibodies cross-linked to Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 4 °C for immunodepletion. The supernatant after spinning down the beads was subjected to the second round of immunodepletion. Immunodepletion was assayed by Western blot analysis. Mouse cDNA clones corresponding to PA28α and PA28β (37.Kandil E. Kohda K. Ishibashi T. Tanaka K. Kasahara M. Immunogenetics. 1997; 46: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) were digested withNcoI and EcoRI, or NdeI andEcoRI, respectively. Each cDNA fragment encompassing an entire coding region starting at the initiation codon, was inserted into pET23d (digested with NcoI and EcoRI) or pET23a (digested with NdeI and EcoRI), respectively. Recombinant proteins were expressed as described (27.Minami Y. Höhfeld J. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.-U. J. Biol.

Hetero-oligomers were reconstituted from purified PA28α and PA28β as described (38.Song X. von Kampen J. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol.

Luciferase (10 μm) was denatured at room temperature by incubation for 30 min in a buffer containing 6m guanidinium-HCl, 30 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2, and 2 mm DTT. Denatured luciferase was diluted 100-fold (0.1 μm final concentration) with a refolding buffer containing 3 mm ATP, an ATP regenerating system (10 mm creatine phosphate and 50 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase) and the indicated components (Hsc70, 4 μm; Hsp40, 3 μm; reconstituted PA28, 15 μm; BSA, 15 μm). The reaction mixtures were incubated for 1 h at 30 °C and luciferase activities were measured as described above. Heat induction of the chaperone activity of Hsp90 and the initiation of the refolding process could be readily monitored by stabilizing the capture by Hsp90 dimer (39.Minami Y. Kimura Y. Kawasaki H. Suzuki K. Yahara I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1459-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 40.Maruya M. Sameshima M. Nemoto T. Yahara I. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 903-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) of a substrate, the firefly luciferase, to which a photoreactive biotin-tag was conjugated via Sulfo-NHS ester, using an ultraviolet (UV)-induced cross-linker. The biotin-tag was transferred to Hsp90 when UV was irradiated and then the disulfide bond was cleaved with DTT (Fig. 1 A,lane 1), following the capture of the luciferase by Hsp90, while a significant amount of biotin-tag was covalently trapped on the luciferase molecule itself, presumably through intramolecular cross-linking. In the absence of UV irradiation, no intermolecular tag transfer to HSP90 was detected and the intramolecular tagging to luciferase was limited (Fig. 1 A, compare lanes 1 and 2). When Hsp90 and luciferase were separately heated, and then combined at room temperature, the tag was not transferred from luciferase to Hsp90 upon UV exposure (Fig. 1 A, compare lanes 3 and 4). Thus the tag transfer reflected the capture of luciferase by Hsp90 that occurred only during heat inactivation. Heat-induced luciferase association was further investigated by measuring the effect of Hsp90 on the rise in turbidity resulting from the aggregation of luciferase (Fig. 1 B). During heat, Hsp90 suppressed luciferase aggregation in a concentration-dependent manner, while BSA had no effect on the initial velocity of aggregation and even increased the total turbidity. These data, taken together, support the idea that Hsp90 possesses a heat-inducible chaperone activity toward luciferasein vitro. Next we assayed the protease susceptibility of luciferase to probe for a potential change in its structural flexibility in the presence or absence of Hsp90. The conformation of chaperone-bound protein substrate is in a collapsed state with a high protease sensitivity and in contrast, the heat-aggregated substrate is highly resistant to protease (32.Martin J. Langer T. Boteva R. Schramel A. Horwich A.L. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1991; 352: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar, 33.Langer T. Lu C. Echols H. Flanagan J. Hayer M.K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1992; 356: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Thermal denaturation in the presence of Hsp90 substantially increased the proteinase K sensitivity of luciferase, while addition of BSA had no such effect (Fig. 1 C). Thus, binding of heat-activated Hsp90 not only prevented aggregation but also initiated a reorganization in the tertiary structure of the luciferase, as indicated by the increase in protease sensitivity. Despite capturing of the luciferase by Hsp90 during heat inactivation, the activity of luciferase was completely lost at the end of the 5-min incubation at either 45 or 50 °C (data not shown), suggesting that the Hsp90-initiated reorganization was not able to fully refold luciferase. However, addition of 50% RL after the thermal inactivation resulted in a dramatic reactivation, in an Hsp90 concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2 A). A 10-fold excess amount of Hsp90 dimer present during the heat inactivation process was largely sufficient to enable RL-dependent reactivation of thermally denatured luciferase, while BSA could not substitute for Hsp90 (Fig. 2 A). Although the capture of denatured luciferase by Hsp90 was also apparent upon a milder heat treatment at 42 °C (Fig. 2 B), the potency of Hsp90 to maintain luciferase in such a refolding-competent state tended to be more manifested at higher temperatures (Fig. 2 A), in line with an increased transfer of biotin-tag at 50 °C compared with 45 °C (Fig. 1 A, lanes 7 and 8). Hereafter we choose the condition of 45 °C for 5 min in order to emphasize the dependence on Hsp90 of the refolding of thermally denatured luciferase. Our finding that Hsp90 maintained partially unfolded luciferase in a folding-competent state is consistent with the finding by Freeman and Morimoto (16.Freeman B.C. Morimoto R.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2969-2979Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Thus Hsp90 may play an important role in the protection of the cytosolic proteins against heat damages. Reducing the amount of RL added during the incubation following heat inactivation from 50% to less than 5% provided a way to examine the requirement for various cofactors during the refolding process. When purified Hsc70 and Hsp40 were supplemented in the presence of 3% RL and ATP, a full refolding activity comparable to the effect of 50% RL was reconstituted (Fig. 2 C). However, the exclusion of either one of the four components (RL, Hsc70, Hsp40, and ATP) abolished the refolding activity. These results indicated that Hsc70 indeed participated in the refolding reaction of luciferase, and that Hsp40 and at least another additional component in the RL may also be necessary for full accomplishment of the refolding/reactivation process. To gain insight into the molecular proximity between the various protein factors involved in the refolding process, we examined the extent of tag transfer to each one of the necessary components. Upon refolding of luciferase by addition of Hsc70, Hsp40, and RL, biotin-tag was immediately transferred to Hsc70, and this transfer closely followed a time-dependent decrease in the amount of the tag transferred to Hsp90 (Fig. 2 D). The tag appeared to be also transferred to Hsp40, although only to a much smaller extent. These data suggested that the luciferase, initially bound to Hsp90, may be released and bind to other factors, and that Hsc70, Hsp40, and a third yet unidentified factor present in RL, may cooperate in this process. Recently several cofactors of Hsc70 and Hsp90, such as Hip/p48, p60/Hop, and p23, have been documented (3.Frydman J. Höhfeld J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 87-92Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 5.Johnson J.L. Craig E.A. Cell. 1997; 90: 201-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar): these may include a candidate for the unknown factor. In our hands, purified Hip (41.Höhfeld J. Minami Y. Hartl F.-U. Cell. 1995; 83: 589-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) could not complement the lack of RL during the reactivation of luciferase even in the presence of both Hsc70 and Hsp40 (data not shown). The reported elution positions for Hop and p23 on a DEAE-cellulose column (42.Dittmar K.D. Hutchison K.A. Owens-Grillo J.K. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12833-12839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) also seemed to differ from those of the reactivation activities eluted with a DEAE-cellulose column (see below). Taken together, these data suggested that RL contained a necessary cofactor distinct from Hsp90, Hsc70, Hsp40, or known cofactors such as Hip, Hop, or p23, and that this cofactor was critical in the reactivation of thermally denatured luciferase. To elucidate the molecular identity of this factor, we attempted to purify the active component(s) (referred hereafter as cofactor activity) contained in the RL, that enables the reactivation of luciferase captured by Hsp90 during thermal inactivation in the presence of Hsc70 and Hsp40. A single broad peak was eluted from a DEAE-cellulose column at around 250 mm KCl (data not shown), further concentrated by ammonium sulfate fractionation, and then applied to a Sephacryl S-300 size-exclusion column. The cofactor activity was recovered at a relative molecular mass of 160 kDa (data not shown). This fraction was further chromatographed on hydroxyapatite and Q-Sepharose columns. Although the fractions containing the peak activity at this stage still included more than 10 proteins (Fig. 3), we found that elution of a protein band of 30 kDa most closely coincided with the cofactor activity enriched through the above steps (data not shown). This 30-kDa protein was separated and isolated as two close bands on a preparative SDS-PAGE. While the N-terminal amino acid sequences for both were blocked and could not be determined, sequences obtained from lysylendopeptidase-digested peptide fragments revealed that the two bands corresponded to the proteasome activator PA28α and PA28β, respectively (35.Ahn J.Y. Tanahashi N. Akiyama K. Hisamatsu H. Noda C. Tanaka K. Chung C.H. Shimbara N. Willy P.J. Mott J.D. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. FEBS Lett. 1995; 366: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). Immunoblot analyses using an anti-peptide antibody against the human PA28α showed that PA28α was co-eluted with the cofactor activity at each purification step (data not shown). A similar result was obtained by using an anti-peptide antibody against human PA28β (data not shown). These results raised the possibility that PA28α and PA28β may participate as cofactors in the reactivation of thermally denatured luciferase. An apparent discrepancy was observed between the molecular size of this factor on an SDS-PAGE (30 kDa; Fig. 3), and that on a size-exclusion column (160 kDa); however, this is consistent with previous reports showing that PA28 probably exists as a heterohexamer (19.Song X. Mott J.D. von Kampen J. Pramanik B. Tanaka K. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26410-26417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To establish the role of PA28 in the reactivation of thermally denatured luciferase, we carried out immunodepletion and reconstitution experiments, using PA28 purified to homogeneity from bovine blood cells (Fig. 4 A). First, we investigated whether PA28 was truly a part of the required component(s). It was difficult to immunodeplete PA28 directly from RL, because of the presence of a large amount of hemoglobin. To circumvent this difficulty, hemoglobin was removed from RL by passing it through DEAE-cellulose column chromatography to yield fraction II, a high salt eluate containing most of the non-hemoglobin proteins (36.Ciechanover A. Hod Y. Hershko A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 81: 1100-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). The cofactor activity was totally absent from the flow-through fraction, while it was almost fully recovered in fraction II (data not shown). When fraction II was immunodepleted using an anti-PA28 antibody, a significant reduction in the cofactor activity was observed (Fig.4 B, columns 1 and 2), in parallel with the removal of the majority of PA28 immunoreactivity (Fig. 4 B, inset). To ascertain that the reduction in the cofactor activity was mediated by the exclusion of PA28 and not due to an indirect effect, we examined whether readdition of PA28 could complement th"

Olsen R.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 569-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1799) Google Scholar). This receptor is the site of action of various pharmacologically and clinically important drugs, such as benzodiazepines, barbiturates, steroids, anesthetics, and convulsants. These drugs modulate GABA-induced chloride ion flux by interacting with separate and distinct allosteric binding sites (2.Sieghart W. Pharmacol. Rev. 1995; 47: 181-234PubMed Google Scholar). The GABAA receptor is a hetero-oligomeric protein consisting of five subunits (3.Nayeem N. Green T.P. Martin I.L. Barnard E.A. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 815-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 4.Tretter V. Ehya N. Fuchs K. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2728-2737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). So far at least 20 GABAA receptor subunits belonging to several subunit classes (six α, four β, four γ, one δ, one ε, one π, and three ρ) have been identified (5.Barnard E.A. Skolnick P. Olsen R.W. Möhler H. Sieghart W. Biggio G. Braestrup C. Bateson A.N. Langer S.Z. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 291-313PubMed Google Scholar). In situ hybridization and immunocytochemical studies indicate a distinct but overlapping temporal and regional expression of these subunits. The finding that multiple receptor subunits are expressed within single neurons (6.Wisden W. Laurie D.J. Monyer H. Seeburg P.H. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 1040-1062Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Fritschy J.M. Benke D. Mertens S. Oertel W.H. Bachi T. Möhler H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6726-6730Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), raises the possibility for the formation of an extremely large variety of GABAA receptor subtypes. However, not all receptors that can be formed theoretically are formed in the cells (8.Jechlinger M. Pelz R. Tretter V. Klausberger T. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2449-2457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Nusser Z. Sieghart W. Somogyi P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, GABAA receptor heterogeneity is limited by the temporal and spatial pattern of subunit expression and by the selective oligomerization mediated by receptor assembly. The assembly of hetero-oligomeric receptors is a complex, multistep process that generally occurs in the endoplasmatic reticulum (10.Connolly C.N. Krishek B.J. McDonald B.J. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 89-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 11.Verrall S. Hall Z.W. Cell. 1992; 68: 23-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Each subunit must recognize its neighbors via specific high affinity contact sites. To achieve the correct order of subunits around the pore, in addition selective discriminations must be made between different subunits. So far, little is known on the molecular mechanism of GABAA receptor assembly. Recently it was demonstrated that after transfection of human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells with dual combinations of α1, β3, and γ2 subunits, α1γ2 and β3γ2 dimers as well as α1β3 tetramers and pentamers were formed (4.Tretter V. Ehya N. Fuchs K. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2728-2737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggested that assembly of one of the major GABAA receptor subtypes composed of α1, β3, and γ2 subunits could start with the formation of each of the three possible dimers and led to the determination of the stoichiometry and subunit arrangement of α1β3γ2 receptors (Fig.1) (4.Tretter V. Ehya N. Fuchs K. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2728-2737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Chang Y. Wang R. Barot S. Weiss D. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 26063-26066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Since in this receptor only a single γ2 subunit is present and situated between an α1 and a β3 subunit, distinct binding sites for α1 and β3 subunits should exist on the γ2 subunit. In the present study truncated γ2 subunits as well as mutated and chimeric constructs were used to identify amino acid sequences on γ2 subunits mediating assembly with α1 and β3 subunits. The neural network-based prediction PHDsec, Monte Carlo optimization as well as hydrophobicity analysis provided important additional information on the structure of GABAA receptors and indicated that the identified γ2 sequences form the intersubunit contact sites with α1 and β3 subunits.

Int. 1999; 34: 453-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) were generated and affinity purified as described previously. For the generation of recombinant receptors, α1, β3, and γ2 subunits of GABAA receptors from rat brain were cloned and subcloned into pCDM8 expression vectors (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) as described previously (4.Tretter V. Ehya N. Fuchs K. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2728-2737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Zezula J. Slany A. Sieghart W. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 301: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Truncated subunits were constructed by polymerase chain reaction amplification using the full-length subunit as template. The polymerase chain reaction primers contained EcoRI and HindIII restriction sites, which were used to clone the fragments into pCDNAIAmp vectors (Invitrogen). The truncated subunits were confirmed by sequencing. Chimeras were constructed using the “gene SOEing” technique (17.White B.A. PCR Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1993: 251-261Google Scholar) and were cloned into pCDNAIAmp vectors using the EcoRI and HindIII restriction sites of the primers. Transformed HEK 293 cells (CRL 1573; American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS), 2 mm glutamine, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in 75 cm2 culture dishes using standard cell culture techniques. HEK 293 cells (3 × 106) were transfected with a total amount of 20 μg of subunit cDNAs via the calcium phosphate precipitation method (18.Chen C.A. Okayama H. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The cells were harvested 44 h after transfection. The culture medium was removed from HEK 293 cells transfected with α1, β3, and γ2 subunits together with a truncated γ2construct (cDNA ratio 1:1:1:1) and the cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, 140 mm NaCl, and 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.3). Cells were then detached from the culture dishes by incubating with 2.5 ml of 5 mm EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min at room temperature. The resulting cell suspension was diluted in 6.5 ml of cold Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 × g. The pellet from two dishes was incubated with 30 μg of α1-(1–9) antibodies in 3 ml of the same medium for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were again pelleted and free antibodies were removed by washing twice with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline buffer. Then receptors were extracted with low IP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, pH 8.0) containing 1% Triton X-100 for 1 h under gentle shaking. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (30 min; 150,000 × g; 4 °C). After addition of Immunoprecipitin (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD; see Ref. 4.Tretter V. Ehya N. Fuchs K. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2728-2737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and 0.5% nonfat dry milk powder and shaking for 3 h at 4 °C, the precipitate was centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × gand washed three times with low IP buffer. The precipitated receptors were then suspended in 1 ml of a solution containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris citrate buffer, pH 7.1, 150 mm NaCl, and 20 nm [3H]Ro 15-1788 (20.9 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products, Dreieich, Germany). After incubation for 90 min at 4 °C, the suspensions were filtered through Whatman GF/B filters. The filters were washed twice with 5 ml of a 50 mm Tris citrate buffer, pH 7.1, and the amount of [3H]Ro 15-1788 bound to receptors was measured by liquid scintillation counting. To verify that only receptors on the cell surface were labeled by the antibodies, parallel samples were incubated with antibodies directed against the intracellular loop of GABAA receptor subunits (experiments not shown). These antibodies could not precipitate any GABAA receptor subunits. To investigate a possible redistribution of the antibodies during the extraction procedure, in other experiments the extract containing the cell surface-labeled receptors was divided into two fractions. One fraction was kept at 4 °C for 2 h, whereas the other fraction was incubated with additional α1-(1–9) antibodies at 4 °C for the same time period. Immunoprecipitin was added to both fractions, the resulting precipitates were centrifuged, washed, dissolved in sample buffer (108 mm Tris sulfate, pH 8.2, 10 mm EDTA, 25% (w/v) glycerol, 2% SDS, and 3% dithiothreitol) and were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis (4.Tretter V. Ehya N. Fuchs K. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2728-2737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using digoxygenized γ2-(1–33) antibodies. In both α1-(1–9) precipitates full-length γ2 subunits could be detected. The truncated γ2 subunit, however, could only be detected in the fraction where additional α1-(1–9) antibodies had been added after cell lysis (experiments not shown). Since aggregates consisting of full-length α1 and truncated γ2 subunits are not transported to the cell surface and are present only intracellularly (11.Verrall S. Hall Z.W. Cell. 1992; 68: 23-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), this experiment demonstrated that there was no redistribution of antibodies during extraction and that only receptors present on the cell surface were detected by this procedure. In other experiments membranes from HEK cells transfected with full-length α1 and truncated γ2 subunits were incubated with 10 nm [3H]flunitrazepam (83.0 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the absence or presence of 10 μm diazepam. After incubation for 90 min at 4 °C, the suspensions were filtered through Whatman GF/B filters and subjected to scintillation counting. 44 h after co-transfection of HEK cells with the cDNA of a full-length and a truncated subunit (cDNA ratio 1:1), cells from 4 culture dishes were extracted with 800 μl of a Lubrol extraction buffer (1% Lubrol PX, 0.18% phosphatidylcholine, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, and 100 mg/ml bacitracin) for 8 h at 4 °C. The extract was centrifuged for 40 min at 150,000 ×g at 4 °C and the clear supernatant was incubated overnight at 4 °C under gentle shaking with 15 μg of antibodies directed against the full-length subunit. After addition of Immunoprecipitin and 0.5% nonfat dry milk powder and shaking for additional 3 h at 4 °C, the precipitate was washed three times with low IP buffer. The precipitated proteins were dissolved in sample buffer. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with digoxygenized antibodies was performed as described in Ref. 4.Tretter V. Ehya N. Fuchs K. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2728-2737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. The EMBL PredictProtein server (19.Sander C. Schneider R. Proteins. 1991; 9: 56-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar) was used to align γ2 sequences to homologous sequences available in the SwissProt data base and then to predict the secondary structure based on the set of aligned sequences by the PHDsec method (20.Rost B. Sander C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7558-7562Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 21.Rost B. Sander C. Proteins. 1994; 19: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar). The significance of this prediction for short sequences of interest was evaluated by force field calculations within a Dynamic Monte Carlo (DMC) scheme (22.Kirkpatrick S. Gelatt C. Vecchi M. Science. 1983; 220: 498-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (31620) Google Scholar). In this procedure the structure optimization started with the sequence in extended conformation. Within one DMC step a single φ, ψ, or side chain dihedral angle was updated in the range [−180,180], the conformational energy was calculated within the ECEPP/3 force field (23.Nemethy G. Gibson K.D. Palmer K.A. Yoon C.N. Paterlini G. Zagari A. J. Phys. Chem. 1992; 96: 6472-6484Crossref Scopus (634) Google Scholar) and the free energy of solvation was computed based on a continuum solvation model. 2 × 105 DMC steps were performed. The final acceptance probability was given by a modified Metropolis criterium considering both, conformational and solvation energies. Details on the optimization algorithm are given in Ref. 24.Klein C.T. Mayer B. Köhler G. Wolschann P. J. Mol. Struct. 1996; 370: 33-43Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar. Hydrophobicity analysis was performed according to the relative hydrophobicity scale for amino acids given by Eisenberg et al. (25.Eisenberg D. Schwarz E. Komaromy M. Wall R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 179: 125-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar). Experiments investigating the assembly of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor have indicated that truncated subunits bearing assembly signals form unproductive complexes with full-length subunits and thus inhibit receptor assembly and its subsequent expression on the cell surface (11.Verrall S. Hall Z.W. Cell. 1992; 68: 23-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In the present study, HEK cells were transfected with full-length α1, β3, and γ2 subunits together with a truncated γ2 subunit. The truncated γ2 subunits used are shown in Fig.2 A. GABAAreceptors expressed on the surface of transfected HEK cells were labeled with subunit-specific antibodies. Antibody-labeled receptors were extracted and precipitated by addition of Immunoprecipitin. The amount of receptors precipitated was quantified using a [3H]Ro 15-1788 binding assay and was compared with that precipitated from cells transfected in the absence of truncated subunits. As shown in Fig. 2 B the construct γ2-(1–234) consisting of the complete extracellular N-terminal domain was able to reduce the expression of α1β3γ2 receptors on the cell surface by 50%. When higher amounts of γ2-(1–234) cDNA were co-transfected with full-length α1, β3, and γ2 subunits (cDNA ratio 2:1:1:1) the amount of receptors expressed on the cell surface was reduced to 40% (data not shown). A subsequent reduction in the size of the truncated γ2 subunit indicated that γ2-(1–113) was the smallest N-terminal fragment that could reduce the expression of α1β3γ2 receptors on the cell surface. Control experiments indicated that the failure of γ2-(1–110) to reduce the expression of α1β3γ2 receptors on the cell surface was not due to a weak expression of this construct (Fig.2 C). In order to investigate whether the reduction in the surface expression of α1β3γ2 receptors was due to an interaction of the γ2 fragments with α1subunits, HEK cells were transfected with γ2-(1–234), γ2-(1–130), γ2-(1–117), γ2-(1–113), or γ2-(1–110) constructs together with full-length α1 subunits. Expressed subunits were extracted from these cells, and were immunoprecipitated with α1-(1–9) antibodies. The precipitate was subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using digoxygenized γ2-(1–33) antibodies. Results obtained indicated that the fragments γ2-(1–234), γ2-(1–130), γ2-(1–117) (experiments not shown) as well as γ2-(1–113) (Fig.3 A) could be co-precipitated with α1 subunits from appropriately transfected HEK cells. Binding between α1 subunits and these fragments seemed to be the result of a specific assembly process because on co-transfection of HEK cells with α1 subunits and the fragment γ2-(1–234), high affinity binding sites for [3H]flunitrazepam were newly formed. These sites are assumed to be located at the interface of α1 and γ2 subunits in GABAA receptors (26.Sigel E. Buhr A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 425-429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 27.Slany A. Zezula J. Fuchs K. Sieghart W. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 291: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The number of [3H]flunitrazepam-binding sites formed (25 ± 3 fmol/mg protein) was comparable with that observed after transfection of HEK cells with full-length α1 and γ2 subunits (27 ± 4 fmol/mg of protein) but was significantly smaller (p = 0.0001, unpaired Student'st test) than that of HEK cells transfected with α1, β3, and γ2 subunits (289 ± 10 fmol/mg of protein). Data given are mean values ± S.E. from three different experiments. As shown for cells co-transfected with γ2-(1–113) and with α1 subunits, three protein bands (apparent molecular mass 14, 17, and 20 kDa) were precipitated by α1-(1–9) and detected by γ2-(1–33) antibodies (Fig.3 A). The molecular mass of the smallest protein band (14 kDa) corresponds with that expected for the unglycosylated γ2-(1–113) fragment. Since two glycosylation sites are present in γ2-(1–113) (28.Pritchett D.B. Sontheimer H. Shivers B.D. Ymer S. Kettenmann H. Schofield P.R. Seeburg P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 90: 7558-7562Google Scholar), the 17- and 20-kDa bands presumably represent partially and fully glycosylated γ2-(1–113) fragments, respectively. The fragment γ2-(1–110), in contrast to γ2-(1–113) could not be co-precipitated with α1 subunits from appropriately co-transfected HEK cells (Fig. 3 A), although the actual expression of both truncated constructs could be confirmed by immunoprecipitation and subsequent detection of the proteins with γ2-(1–33) antibodies (Fig. 3 B). The inability to co-precipitate the fragment γ2-(1–110) indicated that α1-(1–9) antibodies did not cross-react with truncated γ2 subunits and support the conclusion of an interaction between γ2 fragments and α1 subunits. As with γ2-(1–113), three protein bands were observed for γ2-(1–110) fragments corresponding to differentially glycosylated proteins. The slight differences in the apparent molecular mass of the unglycosylated and partially glycosylated γ2-(1–113) and γ2-(1–110) fragments (Fig.3 B) might have been due to incomplete denaturation by SDS and a corresponding atypical migration of these proteins with low molecular mass and distinct secondary structure (see “Discussion”). In other experiments it was investigated whether γ2fragments could also interact with β3 subunits. For this, HEK cells were co-transfected with truncated γ2constructs together with full-length β3 subunits. Subunits expressed were precipitated from cell extracts with β3-(345–408) antibodies, and the precipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using digoxygenized γ2-(1–33) antibodies. The truncated γ2-(1–234), γ2-(1–130), and γ2-(1–117) subunits (experiments not shown), as well as the γ2-(1–113) fragment (Fig. 3 C) could be co-precipitated with β3 subunits. A co-precipitation of γ2-(1–110) with β3 subunits, however, was not observed, again excluding a possible cross-reactivity of the β3-(345–408) antibodies with truncated γ2subunits. The actual expression of the truncated subunits in HEK cells co-transfected with β3 subunits was confirmed by precipitation and detection of the fragments with γ2-(1–33) antibodies as shown for the fragments γ2-(1–113) and γ2-(1–110) in Fig.3 D. The amount of γ2-(1–110) precipitated with γ2-(1–33) antibodies was smaller than that of γ2-(1–113) (Fig. 3, B and D). This might have been due to a stabilization of the γ2-(1–113) fragment by binding to α1 or β3subunits. The co-precipitation of γ2-(1–113) with α1 or β3 subunits indicated that this fragment is able to directly bind to these subunits. Since γ2-(1–110) could not be co-precipitated with these subunits, it was possible that amino acids 111–113 form the binding site responsible for interaction with α1 and β3 subunits. In order to investigate this possibility, amino acids 111–113 of the γ2 subunit were replaced by amino acids present at homologous positions in subunits of the same receptor superfamily. As shown in Fig.4 A, the ρ1subunit of the GABAA receptor contains a hydrophobic methionine at a position homologous to the hydrophilic threonine 111 of the γ2 subunit. Since it has been demonstrated that the ρ1 subunit is unable to assemble with α1 or β1 subunits (29.Hackam A.S. Wang T.-L. Guggino W.B. Cutting G.R. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), the γ2-(1–113)mut1 fragment was cloned, containing the T111M mutation (Fig.4 A). This construct was transfected into HEK cells together with α1 or β3 subunits. Cell extracts were precipitated with α1-(1–9) or β3-(345–408) antibodies, respectively, and the precipitate was subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using digoxygenized γ2-(1–33) antibodies. As shown in Fig. 4B, γ2-(1–113)mut1, similar to γ2-(1–113), was able to bind to α1 as well as to β3subunits. In order to investigate whether the two phenylalanines at position 112 and 113 of the γ2 subunit were responsible for binding to α1 and β3 subunits in the γ2-(1–113) construct (Fig. 4 A), γ2-(1–113)mut2 was cloned in which amino acids 111–113 of the γ2 subunit were replaced by the corresponding amino acids of the δ subunit of the acetylcholine receptor (Ile, Val, and Leu), that are completely different from those of the γ2 subunit (Thr, Phe, and Phe). As shown in Fig.4 B, γ2-(1–113)mut2 was also able to bind to α1 and to β3 subunits in appropriately transfected HEK cells. The observation, that binding of the γ2-(1–113) fragment to α1 or β3 subunits was not dependent on the structure of the amino acid residues 111–113, indicated that amino acids 111–113 do not form the site(s) responsible for specific interaction with α1 and β3 subunits. Since the fragment γ2-(1–110) did not bind to α1or β3 subunits, the presence of the amino acids 111–113 might have been necessary for stabilizing the conformation of the actual binding sites in the γ2-(1–113) construct. In order to identify amino acid sequences of the γ2 subunit that are essential for the binding to α1 or β3 subunits, it would have been possible to replace additional amino acids of the γ2-(1–113) fragment by mutagenesis until its ability to bind to α1 or β3 subunits was lost. The replacement of a single amino acid, however, could change the conformation of the sites responsible for binding to α1or β3 subunits even if the replaced amino acid is not located in the respective binding site. In order to avoid this possibility, a different strategy was used: instead of aiming to eliminate the binding sites by mutagenesis, it was investigated which γ2 amino acid sequences could induce binding to α1 or β3 subunits after incorporation into a fragment that originally could not bind to these subunits. A comparison of the N-terminal sequences of the α1 and γ2 subunits indicated that the first 100 amino acids of the α1 subunit are homologous to γ2-(1–113) (Fig. 5). But in contrast to γ2(1–113), α1-(1–100) could not be co-precipitated with α1 or β3subunits after co-expression in HEK cells. In order to incorporate binding sites of the γ2 subunit, several chimeras were constructed by replacing the C-terminal part of the α1-(1–100) fragment with the corresponding γ2 sequences (Fig. 5). These chimeras were transfected into HEK cells together with full-length α1 or β3 subunits. Expressed subunits were precipitated from cell extracts with α1-(328–382) or β3-(345–408) antibodies. The epitopes recognized by these antibodies were present on the full-length α1 or β3 subunits, respectively, but not on the truncated chimeras. The precipitate was subjected to SDS-PAGE and the proteins were detected with digoxygenized α1-(1–9) antibodies in Western blots. The actual expression of the chimeras was confirmed by precipitation and detection with α1-(1–9) antibodies (data not shown). Although in Chim1 the nine C-terminal amino acids of the α1-(1–100) fragment were replaced by amino acids 105–113 of the γ2 subunit, due to the homology of sequences this chimera differed from α1-(1–100) in one amino acid (T95I) only. As indicated in Fig. 5, this chimera could not be co-precipitated with full-length α1 or β3 subunits from appropriately co-transfected HEK cells, demonstrating the specificity of the α1-(328–382) and β3-(345–408) antibodies used and indicating that amino acids γ2-(105–113) are not able to induce the formation of binding sites for α1 or β3 subunits in α1-(1–100). In Chim2, the amino acid sequence α1-(78–100) was replaced by γ2-(91–113). This construct was able to bind to full-length α1, but not to full-length β3 subunits in appropriately co-transfected cells (Fig. 5). Since amino acids γ2-(105–113) were not sufficient to induce binding as discussed above, this indicated that amino acids 91–104 of the γ2 subunit are important for binding to α1subunits. Finally Chim3 was constructed, in which the amino acid sequence α1-(70–100) was replaced by γ2-(83–113) (Fig. 5). Chim3 not only was able to bind to full-length α1, but also to full-length β3subunits in appropriately transfected HEK cells. These results indicated that the additionally incorporated amino acids 83–90 of the γ2 subunit are able to induce the formation of the site responsible for binding to full-length β3 subunits. Interestingly, three protein bands representing differentially glycosylated constructs were observed in the experiments with Chim3. This was similar to previous experiments (Fig. 3) performed with γ2-(1–113), but was in contrast to experiments with α1-(1–100), Chim1, or Chim2, where only two protein bands were observed. The only amino acid that could be glycosylated and differed between Chim3 and Chim2 was the newly introduced Asn90 of the γ2 subunit. These results suggest that Asn90 of the γ2 subunit is actually glycosylated, confirming a previous prediction on glycosylation of this amino acid (28.Pritchett D.B. Sontheimer H. Shivers B.D. Ymer S. Kettenmann H. Schofield P.R. Seeburg P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 90: 7558-7562Google Scholar). To directly confirm that amino acids γ2-(91–104) mediate binding to α1 subunits, an α1-(1–100) fragment was constructed (Chim4, Fig. 5), in which amino acids γ2-(91–104) were incorporated, replacing amino acids α1-(78–91). This chimera, as expected, was able to bind to α1 but not to β3 subunits. In an approach to confirm that the sequence γ2-(83–90) was responsible for binding to β3 subunits, another α1-(1–100) fragment was constructed (Chim5), in which amino acids γ2-(83–90) replaced amino acids α1-(70–77). Chim5, however, could neither bind to α1 nor to β3 subunits (Fig. 5). Since Western blot analysis indicated that the newly introduced Asn90 was not glycosylated in Chim5, it was investigated whether glycosylation of Asn90 was essential for the formation of the β3-binding site. Glycosylation of asparagines requires the sequence N-X-S or N-X-T (where X is any amino acid except proline). Therefore Chim6 was cloned in which amino acids α1-(70–79) were replaced by amino acids γ2-(83–92). In this chimera Asn90 was glycosylated. Surprisingly, however, Chim6"

Many kinds of stresses are reported to induce apoptosis with an increase of ceramide generation. Here we showed that the intracellular ceramide levels increased in parallel with heat shock (HS)-induced apoptosis in an intensity- and time-dependent manner, and synthetic N-acetylsphingosine (C2-ceramide) synergistically enhanced HS-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells. In order to know the role of ceramide generation in HS-induced apoptosis, we examined the effects of C2-ceramide on the levels of mRNA and protein of heat shock proteins (HSPs). The increase of HSP-70 mRNA levels 1–2 h after HS at 42 °C for 30 min was suppressed by C2-ceramide in a dose-dependent manner. In comparison with HSP-70, the levels of HSP-60 and -90 mRNAs were faintly suppressed by C2-ceramide. Similarly, the increase in the protein levels of HSP-70 was significantly suppressed 4–8 h after HS by C2-ceramide in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, in 293 cells, which are constitutively overexpressing HSP-70 gene, the levels of HSP-70 mRNA were suppressed by C2-ceramide in parallel with the increase of apoptotic cells. We next examined the mechanisms by which C2-ceramide suppressed HS-increased HSP-70 expression. The treatment with C2-ceramide did not affect both an activation of a nuclear transcription factor for HSP-70, heat shock factor-1, and an increased transcriptional rate of HSP-70 by HS, but increased the rates of HSP-70 mRNA degradation. In summary, ceramide may efficiently induce HS-induced apoptosis by suppressing anti-apoptotic HSP-70 through a post-transcriptional regulation.

Cell death by apoptotic mechanism was generally executed mainly through a network of pro-apoptotic signals such as cascade of cysteine proteases named caspase family and caspase-related DNase (7.Nunez G.

These results suggest that the extent of apoptosis induction is determined by the balance of intensity between pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic signals.Heat shock (HS) is one of the important apoptosis-inducing stresses and is known to synthesize a set of proteins called heat shock proteins (HSPs). HSPs are involved in the transport, folding, and assembly of the proteins and play a role in keeping cell homeostasis by functioning as molecular chaperons (14.Georgopoulos C. Welch W.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 601-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). HSPs consist of a family including HSP-90, HSP-70, HSP-60, and other small HSPs (15.De Maio A. Shock. 1999; 11: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). In terms of the role of HSP-70 on apoptosis, it was reported that the induction of thermotolerance correlated with the increase of HSP-70 proteins in Chinese hamster fibroblasts (16.Li G.C. Werb Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3218-3222Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar) and was blocked by the inhibition of HSP-70 expression in K-562 leukemia cells (17.Elia G.

Moreover, the overexpression of HSP-70 induced the resistance to TNF-α-induced cytotoxity (20.Jaattela M. Wissing D. Bauer P.A. Li G.C. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3507-3512Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) and to ischemic heart injury (21.Marber M.S. Mestril R. Chi S.H. Sayen M.R. Yellon D.M. Dillmann W.H. J. Clin.

In contrast, the same overexpression of HSP-70 was recently reported to enhance T cell receptor/CD3- and Fas-mediated apoptosis in Jurkat cells (22.Liossis S.N. Ding X.Z. Kiang J.G. Tsokos G.C. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5668-5675PubMed Google Scholar). However, it seems to be in general agreement with that HSP-70 plays a role in the induction of thermotolerance because there are many reports suggesting the anti-apoptotic effects of HSP-70 by showing the inhibition of caspase-3 activation and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-related pathway (19.Gabai V.L.

Among a family of cysteine protein proteases called caspase, caspase-3 has been recognized to function as an executioner of apoptosis, and ceramide was known to increase the degradation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and the activity of caspase-3, probably by releasing cytochromec from mitochondria and activating caspase-9 (34.Mizushima N.

However, in contrast, the direct effect of ceramide on HSP-70 remains to be clarified.In this report, therefore, we investigated the relation of ceramide with HSP-70 in HS-induced apoptosis. We here found that HS-increased ceramide levels were closely related to the intensity of apoptosis and that synthetic N-acetylsphingosine (C2-ceramide) suppressed HS-induced HSP-70 at both mRNA and protein levels. In addition, HSP-70 overexpressing cells showed the decrease of HSP-70 expression as ceramide induced apoptosis, suggesting that anti-apoptotic HSP-70 function was suppressed by pro-apoptotic ceramide-mediated signals. We also investigated the mechanisms by which ceramide suppressed the expression of HSP-70 mRNA and showed the post-transcriptional regulation by ceramide without affecting a transcription factor HSF-1 and HSP-70 transcriptional rate.DISCUSSIONWe have shown here that HS treatment induced apoptotic cell death in human leukemia HL-60 cells in a temperature-dependent manner, and that the intensity of apoptosis was in parallel with the increase of ceramide generation. The simultaneous treatment with HS and exogenous C2-ceramide induced synergistic effects on the induction of apoptosis as shown in Fig. 2 (A–E) and TableI, suggesting that exogenous ceramide not only mediated pro-apoptotic signals but also suppressed anti-apoptotic signals caused by HS to exert a synergistic and efficient apoptosis. Therefore, we examined the effects of ceramide on HS-increased HSP-70 expression and protein synthesis because HSP-70 seemed to function as “chaperonin” and protect the cells against HS-induced apoptosis (14.Georgopoulos C. Welch W.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 601-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). The results showed that ceramide suppressed HS-increased HSP-70 mRNA and protein levels but did not affect those of HSP-60 and -90 significantly (Figs.3 and 4), suggesting the specific anti-apoptotic role of HSP-70 in HS-induced apoptosis. Our present data are consistent with the previous works showing that a transgenic mouse overexpressed by HSP-70 increased the resistance of the heart to ischemic injury (21.Marber M.S. Mestril R. Chi S.H. Sayen M.R. Yellon D.M. Dillmann W.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1446-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar), and that HSP-70-overexpressed Wn-113 WEHI-S cells showed the tolerance to the cytotoxity caused by TNF-α, UV, and hydrogen peroxide (20.Jaattela M. Wissing D. Bauer P.A. Li G.C. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3507-3512Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 C, constitutively overexpressing HSP-70 in 293 cells significantly decreased, as apoptosis was induced by ceramide. These results strongly suggested that HSP-70 played a cell protective role in ceramide-induced apoptosis as well as HS-induced apoptosis, even though recently the overexpression of HSP-70 was reported to enhance T cell receptor/CD3- and Fas-mediated apoptosis in Jurkat cells. Taken together, ceramide seems to exert efficiently its pro-apoptotic effects by suppressing anti-apoptotic signals related to HSP-70 in HS-induced apoptosis.What are the mechanisms by which ceramide suppresses the levels of HSP-70 mRNA expression and protein synthesis? One possibility is a transcriptional regulation of HSP-70 mRNA through a transcriptional factor HSF-1 (43.Kim D. Ouyang H. Li G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2126-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 44.Theodorakis N.G. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4357-4368Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). HS was reported to induce the phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, oligomerization and DNA binding activity to heat shock element of HSF-1 and to increase HSP-70 expression transcriptionally. A calcium ionophore, A23187, suppressed HS-induced HSP-70 expression and synthesis because of the inhibition of HSF-1 phosphorylation in K-562 cells (17.Elia G. De M.A. Rossi A. Santoro M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16111-16118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We also found that HS induced the activation of HSF-1 by inducing the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation in HL-60 cells, but ceramide could not affect HS-induced activation of HSF-1 at all (Fig. 5 A), suggesting that ceramide suppressed HSP-70 expression by the different way from a HSF-1-related transcriptional regulation. To examine this possibility directly, we performed a run-on assay for HSP-70 mRNA expression. As shown in Fig. 5 B, a transcriptional rate of HSP-70 mRNA increased by HS was not suppressed by ceramide. These results suggested that the suppression of HSP-70 expression by ceramide was not owing to a transcriptional regulation through a transcription factor such as HSF-1, but owing to other different mechanisms.Besides a transcriptional regulation, another possible mechanism to suppress HSP-70 expression is post-transcriptional. In fact, HSP-70 expression increased by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate treatment owing to a post-transcriptional inhibition of mRNA degradation in the peripheral blood monocytes (42.Jacquier S.M. Jornot L. Polla B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14094-14099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). It was, therefore, examined whether ceramide post-transcriptionally suppressed HS-increased HSP-70 expression in HL-60 cells. As shown in Fig. 6, when a novel transcription of HSP-70 mRNA was inhibited after the treatment with actinomycin D the degradation of HSP-70 mRNA was faster as compared with that of the control without actinomycin D, showing the existence of the mechanism to degrade HSP-70 mRNA in HL-60 cells. Moreover, the addition of ceramide after treatment with actinomycin D caused more rapid and significant disappearance of HSP-70 mRNA than did no addition of ceramide. These results suggested that ceramide suppressed HSP-70 expression caused by HS through a post-transcriptional regulation.Ceramide has been recognized as a lipid messenger to mediate apoptotic signals. Many signals, including ceramide-activated kinases and protein phosphatases, transcription factors such as Myc and NF-κB, interleukin 1β-converting enzyme-like cysteine proteases called caspases, JNK, and MAP kinases have been reported as indispensable pro-apoptotic molecules in ceramide-induced apoptosis (28.Yao B.

We also reported that jun/AP-1 signaling and the cytosolic translocation of protein kinase C δ were required to the induction of apoptosis by ceramide (32.Sawai H. Okazaki T. Yamamoto H. Okano H.

Whereas many pro-apoptotic signals were reported to play a role in ceramide-induced apoptosis, ceramide was recently shown to compete with anti-apoptotic bcl-2 (45.Mansat V. Laurent G. Levade T. Bettaieb A. Jaffrezou J.P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5300-5304PubMed Google Scholar) and cell survival signal related to phosphatidylinositol-3 and Akt kinases (46.Zhou H. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Pittman R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16568-16575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). We here added HSP-70 in the list of anti-apoptotic signals, which are suppressed by ceramide, and proposed that HSP-70 and ceramide seemed to be balanced for the determination of cell survival and HS-induced apoptosis.The deterioration of HSP-70-related cell protecting system by ceramide through the acceleration of its post-transcriptional degradation was shown to be involved in the efficient induction of apoptosis by HS, but it remains to be clarified in the future how and what kind ceramide-mediating apoptotic signals play a role in post-transcriptional regulation of HSP-70. It is now widely accepted that programmed cell suicide called apoptosis plays an important role in embryogenesis (1.Granerus M. Engstrom W. Cell Prolif. 1996; 29: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), metamorphosis (2.Nishikawa A. Hayashi H. Differentiation. 1995; 59: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), normal tissue turnover, tumorigenesis, and an elimination of damaged cells (3.Jacobson M.D. Weil M. Raff M. Cell. 1997; 88: 347-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2393) Google Scholar). Various kinds of extracellular stresses including ultraviolet (UV), irradiation, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)1-α, anti-Fas-cross-linking, viral infection, and anti-cancer reagents are known to induce apoptosis in many cell systems (4.Lu M.L. Sato M. Cao B. Richie J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8977-8982Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 5.Laster S.M. Wood J.G. Gooding L.R. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 22625-22631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Cell death by apoptotic mechanism was generally executed mainly through a network of pro-apoptotic signals such as cascade of cysteine proteases named caspase family and caspase-related DNase (7.Nunez G. Benedict M.A. Hu Y. Inohara N. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3237-3245Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar, 8.Vaux D.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1999; 96: 245-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar). Anti-apoptotic molecules such as Bcl-2 family, CrmA, and p35 blocked the execution of apoptosis by inhibiting pro-apoptotic signals (9.Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2795) Google Scholar, 10.Zhou Q. Snipas S. Orth K. Muzio M. Dixit V.M. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol.

Recently inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family including XIAP, c-IAP1, and c-IAP2 was shown to act as anti-apoptotic signal by inhibiting caspase-3, -7, and -9 activity (12.Crook N.E. Clem R.J. Miller L.K. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2168-2174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the extent of apoptosis induction is determined by the balance of intensity between pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic signals. Heat shock (HS) is one of the important apoptosis-inducing stresses and is known to synthesize a set of proteins called heat shock proteins (HSPs). HSPs are involved in the transport, folding, and assembly of the proteins and play a role in keeping cell homeostasis by functioning as molecular chaperons (14.Georgopoulos C. Welch W.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 601-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). HSPs consist of a family including HSP-90, HSP-70, HSP-60, and other small HSPs (15.De Maio A. Shock. 1999; 11: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). In terms of the role of HSP-70 on apoptosis, it was reported that the induction of thermotolerance correlated with the increase of HSP-70 proteins in Chinese hamster fibroblasts (16.Li G.C. Werb Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3218-3222Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar) and was blocked by the inhibition of HSP-70 expression in K-562 leukemia cells (17.Elia G. De M.A. Rossi A. Santoro M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16111-16118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). HS-induced thermotolerance showed the resistance to apoptosis induction by pro-apoptotic stresses including TNF-α, UV, oxidative stress, and ceramide (18.Buzzard K.A. Giaccia A.J. Killender M. Anderson R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17147-17153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 19.Gabai V.L. Meriin A.B. Mosser D.D. Caron A.W. Rits S. Shifrin V.I. Sherman M.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18033-18037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Moreover, the overexpression of HSP-70 induced the resistance to TNF-α-induced cytotoxity (20.Jaattela M. Wissing D. Bauer P.A. Li G.C. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3507-3512Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) and to ischemic heart injury (21.Marber M.S. Mestril R. Chi S.H. Sayen M.R. Yellon D.M. Dillmann W.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1446-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). In contrast, the same overexpression of HSP-70 was recently reported to enhance T cell receptor/CD3- and Fas-mediated apoptosis in Jurkat cells (22.Liossis S.N. Ding X.Z. Kiang J.G. Tsokos G.C. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5668-5675PubMed Google Scholar). However, it seems to be in general agreement with that HSP-70 plays a role in the induction of thermotolerance because there are many reports suggesting the anti-apoptotic effects of HSP-70 by showing the inhibition of caspase-3 activation and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-related pathway (19.Gabai V.L.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6124-6134Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Ceramide has been recognized as a lipid mediator in the induction of apoptosis (25.Obeid L.M. Linardic C.M. Karolak L.A. Hannun Y.A. Science. 1993; 259: 1769-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar), since a diverse array of stresses leading to apoptosis were reported to increase ceramide levels in many cell types (26.Kolesnick R.N. Haimovitz A., F. Fuks Z. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1994; 72: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). As a downstream signal of ceramide, the transcription factors including NF-κB and c-Myc (27.Yang Z. Costanzo M. Golde D.W. Kolesnick R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20520-20523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), serine/threonine kinases (ceramide-activated protein kinase, MAP kinase, and JNK), and phosphatases (28.Yao B. Zhang Y.

Recently, we demonstrated that a transcription factor AP-1 was also required to ceramide-induced apoptosis (32.Sawai H. Okazaki T. Yamamoto H. Okano H. Takeda Y. Tashima M. Sawada H. Okuma M. Ishikura H. Umehara H. et al.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27326-27331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and that the translocation of protein kinase C δ and ε to the cytosol from the membrane was necessary to TNF-α-, Fas cross-linking-, and ceramide-induced apoptosis (33.Sawai H.

Among a family of cysteine protein proteases called caspase, caspase-3 has been recognized to function as an executioner of apoptosis, and ceramide was known to increase the degradation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and the activity of caspase-3, probably by releasing cytochromec from mitochondria and activating caspase-9 (34.Mizushima N. Koike R. Kohsaka H. Kushi Y. Handa S. Yagita H. Miyasaka N. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 35.Gamen S. Marzo I. Anel A. Pineiro A. Naval J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 232-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Since the overexpression of HSP-70 inhibited ceramide-induced apoptosis through the inhibition of caspase-3 like protease activation (23.Mosser D.D. Caron A.W. Bourget L. Denis L.C. Massie B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5317-5327Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar, 36.Buzzard K.A. Giaccia A.J. Killender M. Anderson R.L. J. Biol.

However, in contrast, the direct effect of ceramide on HSP-70 remains to be clarified. In this report, therefore, we investigated the relation of ceramide with HSP-70 in HS-induced apoptosis.

Pittman R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16568-16575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). We here added HSP-70 in the list of anti-apoptotic signals, which are suppressed by ceramide, and proposed that HSP-70 and ceramide seemed to be balanced for the determination of cell survival and HS-induced apoptosis.The deterioration of HSP-70-related cell protecting system by ceramide through the acceleration of its post-transcriptional degradation was shown to be involved in the efficient induction of apoptosis by HS, but it remains to be clarified in the future how and what kind ceramide-mediating apoptotic signals play a role in post-transcriptional regulation of HSP-70. We have shown here that HS treatment induced apoptotic cell death in human leukemia HL-60 cells in a temperature-dependent manner, and that the intensity of apoptosis was in parallel with the increase of ceramide generation. The simultaneous treatment with HS and exogenous C2-ceramide induced synergistic effects on the induction of apoptosis as shown in Fig. 2 (A–E) and TableI, suggesting that exogenous ceramide not only mediated pro-apoptotic signals but also suppressed anti-apoptotic signals caused by HS to exert a synergistic and efficient apoptosis. Therefore, we examined the effects of ceramide on HS-increased HSP-70 expression and protein synthesis because HSP-70 seemed to function as “chaperonin” and protect the cells against HS-induced apoptosis (14.Georgopoulos C. Welch W.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 601-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). The results showed that ceramide suppressed HS-increased HSP-70 mRNA and protein levels but did not affect those of HSP-60 and -90 significantly (Figs.3 and 4), suggesting the specific anti-apoptotic role of HSP-70 in HS-induced apoptosis. Our present data are consistent with the previous works showing that a transgenic mouse overexpressed by HSP-70 increased the resistance of the heart to ischemic injury (21.Marber M.S. Mestril R. Chi S.H. Sayen M.R. Yellon D.M. Dillmann W.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1446-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar), and that HSP-70-overexpressed Wn-113 WEHI-S cells showed the tolerance to the cytotoxity caused by TNF-α, UV, and hydrogen peroxide (20.Jaattela M. Wissing D. Bauer P.A. Li G.C. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3507-3512Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 C, constitutively overexpressing HSP-70 in 293 cells significantly decreased, as apoptosis was induced by ceramide. These results strongly suggested that HSP-70 played a cell protective role in ceramide-induced apoptosis as well as HS-induced apoptosis, even though recently the overexpression of HSP-70 was reported to enhance T cell receptor/CD3- and Fas-mediated apoptosis in Jurkat cells. Taken together, ceramide seems to exert efficiently its pro-apoptotic effects by suppressing anti-apoptotic signals related to HSP-70 in HS-induced apoptosis. What are the mechanisms by which ceramide suppresses the levels of HSP-70 mRNA expression and protein synthesis? One possibility is a transcriptional regulation of HSP-70 mRNA through a transcriptional factor HSF-1 (43.Kim D. Ouyang H. Li G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2126-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 44.Theodorakis N.G. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4357-4368Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). HS was reported to induce the phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, oligomerization and DNA binding activity to heat shock element of HSF-1 and to increase HSP-70 expression transcriptionally. A calcium ionophore, A23187, suppressed HS-induced HSP-70 expression and synthesis because of the inhibition of HSF-1 phosphorylation in K-562 cells (17.Elia G. De M.A. Rossi A. Santoro M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16111-16118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We also found that HS induced the activation of HSF-1 by inducing the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation in HL-60 cells, but ceramide could not affect HS-induced activation of HSF-1 at all (Fig. 5 A), suggesting that ceramide suppressed HSP-70 expression by the different way from a HSF-1-related transcriptional regulation. To examine this possibility directly, we performed a run-on assay for HSP-70 mRNA expression. As shown in Fig. 5 B, a transcriptional rate of HSP-70 mRNA increased by HS was not suppressed by ceramide. These results suggested that the suppression of HSP-70 expression by ceramide was not owing to a transcriptional regulation through a transcription factor such as HSF-1, but owing to other different mechanisms. Besides a transcriptional regulation, another possible mechanism to suppress HSP-70 expression is post-transcriptional. In fact, HSP-70 expression increased by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate treatment owing to a post-transcriptional inhibition of mRNA degradation in the peripheral blood monocytes (42.Jacquier S.M. Jornot L. Polla B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14094-14099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). It was, therefore, examined whether ceramide post-transcriptionally suppressed HS-increased HSP-70 expression in HL-60 cells. As shown in Fig. 6, when a novel transcription of HSP-70 mRNA was inhibited after the treatment with actinomycin D the degradation of HSP-70 mRNA was faster as compared with that of the control without actinomycin D, showing the existence of the mechanism to degrade HSP-70 mRNA in HL-60 cells. Moreover, the addition of ceramide after treatment with actinomycin D caused more rapid and significant disappearance of HSP-70 mRNA than did no addition of ceramide. These results suggested that ceramide suppressed HSP-70 expression caused by HS through a post-transcriptional regulation. Ceramide has been recognized as a lipid messenger to mediate apoptotic signals. Many signals, including ceramide-activated kinases and protein phosphatases, transcription factors such as Myc and NF-κB, interleukin 1β-converting enzyme-like cysteine proteases called caspases, JNK, and MAP kinases have been reported as indispensable pro-apoptotic molecules in ceramide-induced apoptosis (28.Yao B.

https://openalex.org/W2318894243,"The LMP-1 oncoprotein of EBV is required to maintain proliferation of infected B-cells and shares several features with CD40, TNF-R1, and related receptors. Members of this family can bind TRAF and TRADD molecules and activate NF-kappaB and AP-1, as can LMP-1. While CD40 and TNF-R1 are dependent on binding their ligands for their signaling, LMP-1 apparently is not. We have found that LMP-1 can act as a governor of cell proliferation and thereby limit its own activities. Its inhibition of proliferation is not mediated by apoptosis but results in cytostasis in four cell lines tested. The structural moiety of LMP-1 that distinguishes it from CD40 and TNF-R1, its amino-terminus and multiple membrane spanning segments, alone can mediate its cytostatic activity."

Biochem. 1995; 64: 403-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar). Type XIII collagen belongs to the group of membrane-associated collagens, together with the hemidesmosomal component type XVII collagen. These two nonfibrillar collagen types are not structurally homologous except that both have been predicted to have a transmembrane domain near their N terminus. Immunoprecipitation of biotinylated type XIII collagen from surface-labeled HT-1080 cells, subcellular fractionation, and immunofluorescence staining have been used to demonstrate that type XIII collagen molecules are indeed located in the plasma membranes of these cells (3.Hägg P.

Type XIII collagen molecules are presumed to reside in the plasma membrane in a “type II” orientation with a cDNA-derived predicted structure consisting of a short N-terminal cytosolic domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a large, mainly collagenous ectodomain. The N-terminal noncollagenous domain, NC1,1 of the human α1(XIII) chain encompasses a 38-residue cytosolic domain, a 23-residue transmembrane domain, and the first 60 residues of the noncollagenous extracellular sequences adjacent to the plasma membrane (3.Hägg P.

The rest of the ectodomain is predicted to contain three collagenous sequences, COL1–3, with sizes of 104, 172, and 235 residues, respectively, and noncollagenous domains, NC2–4, with sizes of 34, 22, and 18 residues (3.Hägg P.

The expression of type XVII collagen is restricted to stratified epithelia (17.Giudice G.J. Squiquera H.L. Elias P.M. Diaz L.A. J. Clin.

According to Northern and in situ hybridization experiments, type XIII collagen mRNAs are found in all fetal tissues studied, including bone, cartilage, intestine, skin, and striated muscle, and the placenta (9.Juvonen M.

Until now, type XIII collagen has mainly been characterized on the cDNA and genomic levels, while studies on the protein level have been hampered by its low level of expression and the lack of suitable antibodies. To gain more information on type XIII collagen protein, we expressed it in insect cells using the baculovirus expression system (20.Gruenwald S. Heitz J. Baculovirus Expression Vector System: Procedures & Methods Manual. Pharmingen, San Diego, CA1993Google Scholar). We have now produced two polyclonal antibodies against synthetic peptides corresponding to the NC2 and NC4 domains of human type XIII collagen, and have generated a novel pan-collagen monoclonal antibody that recognizes not only type XIII collagen in Western blotting, but also all the other collagen types studied. The recombinant expression system and the new antibodies were then used to characterize the conditions required for the association of type XIII collagen α chains into disulfide-bonded trimers and the location of the interchain disulfides. Furthermore, pepsin and trypsin/chymotrypsin digestions were used to demonstrate the folding of the ectodomain into three triple helical domains and to assess the T m of these domains. Two synthetic peptides corresponding to residues 137–149 (ECLSSMPAALRSS) in the NC2 domain and residues 588–611 (GAPGLDAPCPLGEDGLPVQGCWNK) in the COL3 and NC4 domains of human type XIII collagen (5.Pihlajaniemi T. Tamminen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16922-16928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were synthesized using an automated Applied Biosystems 433A peptide synthesizer (Department of Biochemistry, University of Oulu, Finland). The peptides were purified by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography and sequenced by peptide sequencing (Applied Biosystems 477A). 5 mg of each purified peptide was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Sigma) by a standard procedure using glutaraldehyde (21.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor NY1988Google Scholar). For primary immunization, the coupled peptide solutions were emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant and injected intradermally into four rabbits. Booster injections with coupled peptide solutions emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant were given at 4-week intervals. The sera were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Vectastain, Vector Labs) using the uncoupled peptide as an antigen. Subsequently, the positive antisera were analyzed by Western blotting of lysates from insect cells expressing recombinant human type XIII collagen (wthumanXIII) and, as a negative control, recombinant human prolyl 4-hydroxylase (4PHαβ, Ref. 22.Nokelainen M. Helaakoski T. Myllyharju J. Notbohm H. Pihlajaniemi T. Fietzek P.P. Kivirikko K.I. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 329-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In accordance with this analysis, two sera were selected and named antibody XIII/NC2–55 and antibody XIII/NC4-SO. For further studies, antibody XIII/NC4-SO was purified by affinity chromatography by coupling the corresponding peptide to epoxy-activated Sepharose 6B according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The antibody was diluted 1:5 with a solution of 0.1m NaCl and 0.02 mK2HPO4, pH 7.0, and applied to the column, which was subsequently washed with a solution of 0.5 m NaCl and 0.02 m K2HPO4, pH 7.0. Specific antibody molecules were sequentially eluted with 0.03 mglycine-HCl, pH 2.9, and 0.1 m triethylamine, pH 11.0. The protein-containing fractions were detected by absorbance at 280 nm, immediately neutralized with 0.2 volume of 2 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, pooled, and concentrated to 0.5 mg/ml (Microsep 30, Filtron Technology Corp.). The cDNA clone E-26 (5.Pihlajaniemi T. Tamminen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16922-16928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) covers all of the coding sequences for the human type XIII collagen α chain except for the beginning of the translation. First, a full-length cDNA called huXIII was constructed at theNotI-EcoRI site of pBS(SK−) by linking a polymerase chain reaction-generated 5′-fragment covering nucleotides 1–272 of the human type XIII collagen gene (6.Tikka L. Elomaa O. Pihlajaniemi T. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17713-17719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the cDNA E-26 (5.Pihlajaniemi T. Tamminen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16922-16928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA huXIII was digested withNotI-EcoRI restriction enzymes and ligated into pVL1392 (Invitrogen), resulting in the construct pVLwthumanXIII. The cDNA del1–38 was generated by polymerase chain reaction from huXIII cDNA so that it lacks the first 124 nucleotides and contains a new initiation methionine replacing the original residue in position 39, at the junction of the cytosolic and transmembrane domains (6.Tikka L. Elomaa O. Pihlajaniemi T. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17713-17719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA del1–38 was digested with NotI-EcoRI and ligated into pVL1392, resulting in the construct pVLdel1–38. Because the cDNA E-26 (5.Pihlajaniemi T. Tamminen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16922-16928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) encodes an in-frame methionine at residue 84, it was also used directly for expression by inserting it into theEcoRI site of pVL1392 resulting in the construct pVLdel1–83. All the pVL constructs generated were separately co-transfected with modified Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus DNA into Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 insect cells using the BaculoGold transfection Kit (Pharmingen). The recombinant viruses were collected, amplified, plaque-purified, and re-amplified (20.Gruenwald S. Heitz J. Baculovirus Expression Vector System: Procedures & Methods Manual. Pharmingen, San Diego, CA1993Google Scholar). The viruses were named wthumanXIII, del1–38, and del1–83 (Fig. 1). Insect cells (Sf9 or High Five, Invitrogen) were grown at 28 °C in TNM-FH medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (BioClear) or in a serum-free HyQ CCM3 medium (HyClone). Cultures were grown either as monolayers or in suspension in spinner or shaker flasks. Cells at a density of 6 × 105 to 1.5 × 106 cells/ml were infected with the virus wthumanXIII, del1–38, or del1–83, either with or without viruses for the α (virus α59, Ref. 23.Vuori K.

In some infections, a virus coding for a mutant α subunit was used in which a conserved aspartate 414 (Asp414) had been converted to alanine (virus αD414A, 24). The D414A mutation does not prevent tetramer formation between the D414A mutant α subunit and the wild-type β subunit, but the resulting enzyme tetramer is totally inactive (24.Myllyharju J.

The viruses wthumanXIII, del1–38, and del1–83 were used in a 5-fold excess over the prolyl 4-hydroxylase encoding viruses. Ascorbate, when present, was added to the culture medium daily at 80 μg/ml. The cells were collected 48–72 h after infection and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The washed cells were then homogenized in a 0.3m NaCl, 0.2% Triton, and 0.07 m Tris buffer, pH 7.4, with or without 1 mm EDTA-Na2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and 0.01% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and centrifuged at 8,000 ×g for 10 min.

High Five insect cells were infected with the virus del1–83 alone or together with separate viruses for the α subunit (virus α59) and β subunit (virus β) of human prolyl 4-hydroxylase. The virus del1–83 was used at m.o.i. 5 and viruses α59 and β at m.o.i. 0.1 or 1. The infected cells were grown in TNM-FH medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and ascorbate (50 μg/ml) was added daily to the culture medium. The cells were harvested 72 h after infection, washed with 1× PBS and homogenized in 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton, and 0.02m Tris, pH 8.0. After centrifugation, the sample was hydrolyzed with 6 m HCl at 120 °C overnight, and the total amount of 4-hydroxyproline was examined in cell homogenates by the method of Kivirikko et al. (25.Kivirikko K.I. Laitinen O. Prockop D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1967; 19: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). Del1–83 protein for purification was expressed in Sf9 cells, since these are easier to grow in suspension than High Five cells. The cells were infected with the del1–83 virus at m.o.i. 5 as described above, harvested 48 h after infection, washed with PBS, homogenized in a 0.013 mCHAPS, 1 mm EDTA-Na2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 0.01% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.05 m Hepes buffer, pH 8.0, and ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The resulting supernatant in 10% glycerol was loaded onto a phosphocellulose column (P-11, Whatman) which had been equilibrated with buffer A (10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA-Na2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 0.02% sodium azide, and 0.05 m Hepes buffer, pH 8.0). The column was washed with buffer A and eluted with a salt gradient from buffer B (buffer A including 0.3 m betaine) to buffer C (buffer B including 1 m NaCl). Fractions containing type XIII collagen were pooled and loaded onto a Resource RPC column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) which had been equilibrated in a 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 10% acetonitrile buffer. The column was eluted with a 10–80% acetonitrile gradient in the presence of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Finally, the type XIII collagen fraction was evaporated to dryness and re-suspended in 25% acetonitrile and 0.1m ammonium acetate buffer, pH 5.0. This sample was chromatographed on a Sephadex 75 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated and eluted with 25% acetonitrile and 0.1 mammonium acetate buffer, pH 5.0. In order to analyze the N-terminal sequence of purified del1–83 α chains, an aliquot of the fraction containing the Resource RPC-purified type XIII collagen was applied to SDS-PAGE and then electroblotted onto a ProBlott membrane (Perkin-Elmer). The band, which was visualized by Coomassie Blue staining and matched antibody detection with antibody XIII/NC3–1, was cut down and loaded directly into a Procise 492 Protein Sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc.). Monoclonal antibodies were produced and prescreened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay commercially (DiaBor OY, Oulu, Finland). Five mice were immunized with Resource RPC-purified type XIII collagen. The sera of all these immunized mice were positive in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blotting (data not shown). One mouse was chosen for final boosting with gel filtration-purified del1–83 protein. Six of the culture media of the fused cells (95D1–6) were positive in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the fusion 95D1 was cloned further. Three clones, 95D1A–C, were obtained, and the IgG of clone 95D1A was purified. For preliminary epitope mapping of the resulting monoclonal antibodies, five recombinant fragments covering the indicated regions of human type XIII collagen (Fig. 1) were produced in bacteria using the QIAexpressionist Kit (Qiagen) and analyzed by denaturing SDS-PAGE, followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or Western blotting with the resulting monoclonal antibodies.

The antigen competition experiments were performed by incubating 95D1A with an excess of purified peptide or with PBS as a control overnight at 4 °C, followed by use in Western blotting. Recombinant type XIII collagen (del1–38) was produced in High Five cells in the presence of exogenous prolyl 4-hydroxylase as described above. Aliquots of the resulting supernatants were digested with 0.15 mg/ml pepsin for 2 min, 5 min, or 1 h at room temperature (28.Bruckner P. Prockop D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 110: 360-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The pepsin was inactivated and the pepsin-resistant fragments were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting using the monoclonal antibody 95D1A and various type XIII collagen-specific polyclonal antibodies (Fig. 6 C). The thermal stability of the pepsin-resistant recombinant type XIII collagen was studied by digestion with a mixture of trypsin and chymotrypsin (28.Bruckner P. Prockop D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 110: 360-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The samples pepsinized for 2 min were heated at 24–70 °C for 5 min and subsequently treated with the mixture of trypsin and chymotrypsin (0.02/0.05 mg/ml) for 2 min at room temperature (28.Bruckner P. Prockop D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 110: 360-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). After inactivation of trypsin and chymotrypsin, aliquots of the pepsinized and trypsin/chymotrypsin-treated samples were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using the monoclonal antibody 95D1A and various type XIII collagen-specific polyclonal antibodies. The T m values for the different collagenous domains of type XIII collagen were determined by densitometry of the intensities of the corresponding trypsin/chymotrypsin-resistant fragments using the ImageQuant Software (Molecular Dynamics). Recombinant type XIII collagen (del1–38) was produced in High Five cells in the presence of recombinant prolyl 4-hydroxylase as described above. Aliquots of the resulting supernatants were heated at 24 °C for 5 min and treated with trypsin (0.01 or 0.05 mg/ml) for 2 min at room temperature. The trypsin was subsequently inactivated and aliquots of the trypsin-treated samples were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting using the monoclonal antibody 95D1A and the various type XIII collagen-specific polyclonal antibodies. Antibodies have previously been produced against the NC1 and NC3 domains of type XIII collagen (3.Hägg P. Rehn M. Huhtala P. Väisänen T. Tamminen M. Pihlajaniemi T. J. Biol.

The amino acid sequence of the NC2 peptide represents the exon 12 alternative splice variant and has low homology with the corresponding mouse sequence, whereas the sequence of the COL3/NC4 peptide is completely conserved between these two species (3.Hägg P.

Three recombinant baculoviruses were generated, wthumanXIII, del1–38, and del1–83, and used to study various properties of human type XIII collagen (see below) and to test the specificity of the ensuing antibodies XIII/NC2–55 and XIII/NC4-SO by Western blotting of the recombinant type XIII collagen variants produced in insect cells (Fig.1). The wthumanXIII virus codes for full-length type XIII collagen α chains, del1–38 for N-terminally truncated α chains, where the cytosolic portion has been deleted and the N terminus starts from the transmembrane domain, and del1–83 for N-terminally truncated α chains, where the N terminus starts from a methionine at residue 84, thus lacking the cytosolic and transmembrane domains and part of the ectodomain of the NC1 domain. These three viruses were used separately to infect High Five cells, which were also solely infected with a virus coding for the two subunits, α and β, of human prolyl 4-hydroxylase (see Ref. 22.Nokelainen M.

This class of zinc finger motifs is unique in that their DNA binding specificities are highly adaptable; unlike most other DNA-binding domains, dozens of zinc finger domains characterized thus far bind to highly diverse DNA sequences, with each zinc finger domain able to recognize distinctive DNA binding sites. Many groups have successfully exploited this adaptability of zinc finger domains in DNA recognition to isolate or design novel proteins with altered DNA binding specificities (1.Desjarlais J.R.

Using phage display, zinc finger proteins that exhibit the desired DNA binding specificities can be selected for almost any predetermined DNA sequence.Because many transcription factors consist of two modular units, that is, an effector (activator or repressor) domain and a DNA-binding domain, it should now be possible to construct novel sequence-specific transcription factors in which tailor-made zinc finger domains are combined with appropriate effector domains. However, the complexity of eukaryotic genomes, in particular the human genome, makes the design of gene-specific transcription factors a formidable challenge. Ideally, designer transcription factors should regulate the expression of one or a few target genes among the tens of thousands of genes in a typical eukaryotic genome. Use of a combinatorial approach (that is, the targeting of a gene of interest with two or more zinc finger transcription factors) may be an effective strategy for achieving gene specificity (8.Kim J.-S. Pabo C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29795-29800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A second approach would be to fuse two zinc finger proteins, each recognizing adjacent but nonoverlapping 9-base pair (bp)1 binding sites to yield highly specific DNA-binding proteins (9.Liu Q. Segal D.J. Ghiara J.B. Barbas III, C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5525-5530Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 10.Kim J.-S. Pabo C.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13827-13834Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For example, Kim and Pabo (10.Kim J.-S. Pabo C.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2812-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) have recently demonstrated that designer proteins containing six zinc finger domains, in which two three-finger proteins are fused via improved linker segments, bind to DNA sequences of 18–20 bp with femtomolar dissociation constants and serve as extremely potent transcriptional repressors in vivo.Such progress in the selection and design of novel zinc finger proteins with the desired DNA binding specificities should now allow construction of designer transcription factors that specifically regulate the expression of target genes. However, important issues must be considered prior to the application of engineered zinc finger proteins in transgenic organisms and eventually in human patients. For example, is the DNA recognition by the six-finger protein specific enough to selectively regulate the transcription of a target gene that exists among the tens of thousands of genes in a typical eukaryotic genome? Can the expression of a target gene be controlled by altering the concentration of zinc finger proteins in a dose-dependent manner? Can the engineered zinc finger proteins access binding sites in a chromatin complex? In this report, we address these questions by transiently and stably transfecting human cells with either a prototype three-finger peptide from Zif268 or a designer six-finger peptide constructed by fusing two three-finger peptides.DISCUSSIONArtificial regulation of gene expression using “designer” transcription factors may have broad applications in the post-genomic era. Genome projects for various organisms will eventually reveal the DNA sequences of tens of thousands of novel genes whose functions are yet to be determined. Experiments that employ DNA microarrays and differential display polymerase chain reaction also will identify candidate genes whose expression levels may contribute to the phenotypic differences among the cell types used in the analyses. To study the function(s) of a gene of interest or to validate the biological role(s) of a candidate gene, biologists often seek to up- and down-regulate the expression of the gene in a living organism or in cell culture and monitor the biological consequences of the altered expression. Zinc finger proteins appear to be well suited for these types of experiments, because a single zinc finger protein can be used for both up- and down-regulation of a gene of interest by fusing the zinc finger DNA-binding domain with appropriate effector domains or by targeting the zinc finger domain to critical sites within the promoter of the gene of interest. To utilize zinc finger domains in such experiments, two three-finger proteins are selected or designed to bind to two nonoverlapping 9–10-bp target sites that are adjacent to each other. The two three-finger proteins are then connected via an appropriate linker to yield a six-finger protein that recognizes the extended 18–20-bp target site. The resulting zinc finger protein may serve as a highly specific transcription factor in cell culture or in transgenic organisms, and this approach may eventually be extended to applications in gene therapy.Our studies suggest that the zinc finger approach has many useful properties that make this system ideal for broad applications in artificial gene regulation: (i) Our results with the six-finger protein (268//NRE) suggest that the zinc finger approach is highly specific. In our transfection studies, the 268//NRE peptide discriminated very efficiently among closely related sequences. Six-finger proteins that recognize target sequences of 18–20 bp may serve as “genome-specific” transcription factors, regulating only a limited number of genes in a complex genome. (ii) Our stable transfection studies suggest that engineered zinc finger proteins could access DNA-binding sites in a chromatin complex and serve as efficient transcription factors, irrespective of the locations of such binding sites in the genome. (iii) Conditional regulation of a target gene can be achieved by subjecting the expression of zinc finger transcription factors to inducible expression systems. By adopting an inducible expression system, we were able to regulate the cellular concentration of zinc finger proteins, and this allowed us to control the expression of a reporter gene in a dose-dependent manner.Many inducible gene expression systems using small molecules such as ecdysone (17.No D. Yao T.-P. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3346-3351Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar), tetracycline (22.Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4227) Google Scholar), rapamycin (23.Rivera V.M. Clackson T. Natesan S. Pollock R. Amara J.F. Keenan T. Magari S.R. Phillips T. Courage N.L. Cerasoli Jr., F. Holt D.A. Gilman M. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), and RU486 (24.Wang Y. O'Malley Jr., B.W. Tsai S.Y. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8180-8184Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) have been developed to conditionally regulate the expression of a gene of interest. In these systems, the promoter of the target gene must be manipulated to contain the appropriate binding sites for artificial activators. Thus, these systems cannot be used to achieve the conditional regulation of endogenous genes in organisms other than mouse, in which gene targeting via homologous recombination is possible. Our results suggest that conditional regulation of endogenous genes in cell culture and in most organisms can be achieved by combining an inducible expression system with our zinc finger approach. The zinc finger approach will circumvent the necessity of manipulating endogenous promoters, because novel zinc finger peptides can be selected or designed to specifically recognize endogenous DNA sites.The zinc finger approach may provide several important advantages over antisense or ribozyme approaches, which are broadly used to regulate endogenous gene expression: (i) Predicting effective binding sites for zinc finger proteins is straightforward. Previous transfection studies have shown that zinc finger proteins serve as efficient transcriptional repressors when they bind to critical sites near the TATA box or the transcription start point (8.Kim J.-S. Pabo C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29795-29800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In contrast, it is much more difficult to choose effective target sites for antisense or ribozyme molecules, and the target sites in mRNA usually are determined by trial and error (25.Tu G. Cao Q. Zhou F. Israel Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25125-25131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). (ii) The zinc finger approach may give much stronger repression than do the antisense or ribozyme approaches. Our study shows that a six-finger protein gives >99% repression of activated transcription in vivo. Thus it appears that blocking the transcription of a single copy of a target gene via the zinc finger approach is more efficient than inhibiting the translation of many copies of mRNA via the antisense or ribozyme approaches, which seldom give >90% repression of target gene expression. (iii) Targeting two or more binding sites in the promoter of a gene of interest with two or more zinc finger proteins can give stronger repression than targeting a single site with a single zinc finger protein (8.Kim J.-S. Pabo C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29795-29800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In contrast, targeting multiple sites in an mRNA using antisense or ribozyme molecules seldom gives synergistic or additive effects. The cumulative effect of multiple zinc finger proteins on transcriptional repression may be useful not only to shut down the expression of a target gene but also to reduce the possibility of selecting resistant clones. In principle, when applied to the suppression of oncogenes or viral genes, all three approaches (zinc finger, ribozyme, and antisense) may suffer from potential problems associated with resistant clones in which point mutations have been introduced at the binding site. When two or more zinc finger proteins bind to distinctive sites, however, it would be much more rare for a mutant clone to arise, because it would require that mutations be introduced into all of the binding sites simultaneously in the same clone. (iv) The zinc finger approach is more flexible in that the zinc finger DNA-binding domains can be linked to domains from other proteins such as basal transcription factors (26.Kim J.-S. Kim J. Cepek K.L. Sharp P.A. Pabo C.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3616-3620Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), transcriptional repression domains (9.Liu Q. Segal D.J. Ghiara J.B.

A. 1997; 94: 5525-5530Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 19.Choo Y. Castellanos A. Garcia-Hernandez B. Sanchez-Garcia I. Klug A. J. Mol.

A. 1998; 95: 14628-14633Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Thus, the zinc finger approach can be used both to down- and up-regulate target gene expression.The fusion of transcriptional repression domains such as the Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) domain to zinc finger proteins with the desired DNA binding specificities appears to be a powerful method for repression of target gene expression (9.Liu Q. Segal D.J. Ghiara J.B. Barbas III, C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5525-5530Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 20.Beerli R.R. Segal D.J. Dreier B. Barbas III, C.F. Proc.

It has been demonstrated that the KRAB domain, when fused to heterologous DNA-binding proteins, represses the expression of a reporter gene, even when bound to sites a few kilobase pairs upstream from the promoter of the gene (27.Margolin J.F.

This property of repression at a distance may be advantageous in many cases, because the zinc finger proteins that are fused to the KRAB domain can be selected or designed to bind target sites anywhere within a few kilobase pairs from the promoter of a target gene. In contrast, if isolated zinc finger proteins (that is, without KRAB domain fusion) are used as transcriptional repressors, the binding sites must be located within a ∼70-bp region around the TATA box and the transcription start point (8.Kim J.-S. Pabo C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29795-29800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This restriction may impose some limitations on the choice of appropriate DNA sites.In terms of specificity, however, the targeting of critical sites around the transcription start point with isolated zinc finger proteins may be more desirable. It has been estimated that there are thousands or more adventitious binding sites in the human genome for any three-finger protein that recognizes a 9–10-bp DNA sequence. Gel shift experiments with nonspecific competitor DNA revealed that the three-finger Zif268 peptide specifically recognizes a 7–8-bp site (7.Greisman H.A. Pabo C.O. Science. 1997; 275: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 10.Kim J.-S. Pabo C.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2812-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), although its binding site covers 9–10 bp in the Zif268-DNA cocrystal structure (28.Pavletich N.P. Pabo C.O. Science. 1991; 252: 809-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that there might be about 100,000 sites in the human genome where the Zif268 peptide could bind. When isolated zinc finger proteins bind to only a few bp upstream of the TATA box or ∼50 bp downstream of the transcription start site, they exert no repression at all (8.Kim J.-S. Pabo C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29795-29800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar,26.Kim J.-S. Kim J. Cepek K.L. Sharp P.A. Pabo C.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3616-3620Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, isolated zinc finger proteins that bind to most of the numerous potential binding sites in the genome would not affect the gene expression. (One isolated report by Choo et al. (18.Choo Y. Sanchez-Garcia I. Klug A. Nature. 1994; 372: 642-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) showed that a designer zinc finger protein gave effective repression when it bound to a site far downstream of the transcription start point. However, this DNA binding event would need to block transcriptional elongation rather than transcriptional initiation. We believe that it is an exception rather than a rule that zinc finger proteins can block transcriptional elongation and not transcriptional initiation. We found that even the six-finger 268//NRE peptide that bound to the 18–20-bp DNA sites with femtomolar dissociation constants could not block transcriptional elongation in our transfection experiments, when the 268//NRE peptide was targeted to a site more than 50 bp downstream of the transcription start point (data not shown). In dramatic contrast, the six-finger peptide gave highly efficient (137-fold) repression of VP16-activated transcription, when it bound to a site near the transcription start point (Fig. 2 A), where the transcription initiation complex is formed.)Zinc finger-KRAB fusion proteins, however, are likely to affect the expression of many genes other than the intended target gene, because the KRAB domain has the ability to function at a distance. This feature of the KRAB domain may cause serious problems in the application of the zinc finger approach in transgenic organisms or in gene therapy. The zinc finger-KRAB fusion approach also may suffer from problems associated with the quenching effect of the repression domain. It seems possible that the KRAB domain of overexpressed zinc finger-KRAB fusion protein in cells may perturb the expression patterns of many genes indirectly by sequestering essential cellular transcription factors. In contrast, it is much less likely that an isolated zinc finger protein would show such pleiotropic effects on gene expression. Many transcription factors in eukaryotes from yeast to plants and to mammals contain the C2H2 class of zinc finger domains as their DNA-binding modules. This class of zinc finger motifs is unique in that their DNA binding specificities are highly adaptable; unlike most other DNA-binding domains, dozens of zinc finger domains characterized thus far bind to highly diverse DNA sequences, with each zinc finger domain able to recognize distinctive DNA binding sites. Many groups have successfully exploited this adaptability of zinc finger domains in DNA recognition to isolate or design novel proteins with altered DNA binding specificities (1.Desjarlais J.R. Berg J.M. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1992; 12: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 2.Desjarlais J.R. Berg J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2256-2260Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 3.Rebar E.J. Pabo C.O. Science. 1994; 263: 671-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 4.Jamieson A.C. Kim S.-H. Wells J.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5689-5695Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 5.Choo Y. Klug A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Using phage display, zinc finger proteins that exhibit the desired DNA binding specificities can be selected for almost any predetermined DNA sequence. Because many transcription factors consist of two modular units, that is, an effector (activator or repressor) domain and a DNA-binding domain, it should now be possible to construct novel sequence-specific transcription factors in which tailor-made zinc finger domains are combined with appropriate effector domains. However, the complexity of eukaryotic genomes, in particular the human genome, makes the design of gene-specific transcription factors a formidable challenge. Ideally, designer transcription factors should regulate the expression of one or a few target genes among the tens of thousands of genes in a typical eukaryotic genome. Use of a combinatorial approach (that is, the targeting of a gene of interest with two or more zinc finger transcription factors) may be an effective strategy for achieving gene specificity (8.Kim J.-S. Pabo C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29795-29800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A second approach would be to fuse two zinc finger proteins, each recognizing adjacent but nonoverlapping 9-base pair (bp)1 binding sites to yield highly specific DNA-binding proteins (9.Liu Q. Segal D.J. Ghiara J.B. Barbas III, C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5525-5530Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 10.Kim J.-S. Pabo C.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2812-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 11.Kamiuchi T. Abe E. Imanishi M. Kaji T. Nagaoka M. Sugiura Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13827-13834Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For example, Kim and Pabo (10.Kim J.-S. Pabo C.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2812-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) have recently demonstrated that designer proteins containing six zinc finger domains, in which two three-finger proteins are fused via improved linker segments, bind to DNA sequences of 18–20 bp with femtomolar dissociation constants and serve as extremely potent transcriptional repressors in vivo. Such progress in the selection and design of novel zinc finger proteins with the desired DNA binding specificities should now allow construction of designer transcription factors that specifically regulate the expression of target genes. However, important issues must be considered prior to the application of engineered zinc finger proteins in transgenic organisms and eventually in human patients. For example, is the DNA recognition by the six-finger protein specific enough to selectively regulate the transcription of a target gene that exists among the tens of thousands of genes in a typical eukaryotic genome? Can the expression of a target gene be controlled by altering the concentration of zinc finger proteins in a dose-dependent manner? Can the engineered zinc finger proteins access binding sites in a chromatin complex? In this report, we address these questions by transiently and stably transfecting human cells with either a prototype three-finger peptide from Zif268 or a designer six-finger peptide constructed by fusing two three-finger peptides. DISCUSSIONArtificial regulation of gene expression using “designer” transcription factors may have broad applications in the post-genomic era. Genome projects for various organisms will eventually reveal the DNA sequences of tens of thousands of novel genes whose functions are yet to be determined. Experiments that employ DNA microarrays and differential display polymerase chain reaction also will identify candidate genes whose expression levels may contribute to the phenotypic differences among the cell types used in the analyses. To study the function(s) of a gene of interest or to validate the biological role(s) of a candidate gene, biologists often seek to up- and down-regulate the expression of the gene in a living organism or in cell culture and monitor the biological consequences of the altered expression. Zinc finger proteins appear to be well suited for these types of experiments, because a single zinc finger protein can be used for both up- and down-regulation of a gene of interest by fusing the zinc finger DNA-binding domain with appropriate effector domains or by targeting the zinc finger domain to critical sites within the promoter of the gene of interest. To utilize zinc finger domains in such experiments, two three-finger proteins are selected or designed to bind to two nonoverlapping 9–10-bp target sites that are adjacent to each other. The two three-finger proteins are then connected via an appropriate linker to yield a six-finger protein that recognizes the extended 18–20-bp target site. The resulting zinc finger protein may serve as a highly specific transcription factor in cell culture or in transgenic organisms, and this approach may eventually be extended to applications in gene therapy.Our studies suggest that the zinc finger approach has many useful properties that make this system ideal for broad applications in artificial gene regulation: (i) Our results with the six-finger protein (268//NRE) suggest that the zinc finger approach is highly specific. In our transfection studies, the 268//NRE peptide discriminated very efficiently among closely related sequences. Six-finger proteins that recognize target sequences of 18–20 bp may serve as “genome-specific” transcription factors, regulating only a limited number of genes in a complex genome. (ii) Our stable transfection studies suggest that engineered zinc finger proteins could access DNA-binding sites in a chromatin complex and serve as efficient transcription factors, irrespective of the locations of such binding sites in the genome. (iii) Conditional regulation of a target gene can be achieved by subjecting the expression of zinc finger transcription factors to inducible expression systems. By adopting an inducible expression system, we were able to regulate the cellular concentration of zinc finger proteins, and this allowed us to control the expression of a reporter gene in a dose-dependent manner.Many inducible gene expression systems using small molecules such as ecdysone (17.No D. Yao T.-P. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3346-3351Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar), tetracycline (22.Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4227) Google Scholar), rapamycin (23.Rivera V.M. Clackson T. Natesan S. Pollock R. Amara J.F. Keenan T. Magari S.R. Phillips T. Courage N.L. Cerasoli Jr., F. Holt D.A. Gilman M. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), and RU486 (24.Wang Y. O'Malley Jr., B.W. Tsai S.Y. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8180-8184Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) have been developed to conditionally regulate the expression of a gene of interest. In these systems, the promoter of the target gene must be manipulated to contain the appropriate binding sites for artificial activators. Thus, these systems cannot be used to achieve the conditional regulation of endogenous genes in organisms other than mouse, in which gene targeting via homologous recombination is possible. Our results suggest that conditional regulation of endogenous genes in cell culture and in most organisms can be achieved by combining an inducible expression system with our zinc finger approach. The zinc finger approach will circumvent the necessity of manipulating endogenous promoters, because novel zinc finger peptides can be selected or designed to specifically recognize endogenous DNA sites.The zinc finger approach may provide several important advantages over antisense or ribozyme approaches, which are broadly used to regulate endogenous gene expression: (i) Predicting effective binding sites for zinc finger proteins is straightforward. Previous transfection studies have shown that zinc finger proteins serve as efficient transcriptional repressors when they bind to critical sites near the TATA box or the transcription start point (8.Kim J.-S. Pabo C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29795-29800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In contrast, it is much more difficult to choose effective target sites for antisense or ribozyme molecules, and the target sites in mRNA usually are determined by trial and error (25.Tu G. Cao Q. Zhou F. Israel Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25125-25131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). (ii) The zinc finger approach may give much stronger repression than do the antisense or ribozyme approaches. Our study shows that a six-finger protein gives >99% repression of activated transcription in vivo. Thus it appears that blocking the transcription of a single copy of a target gene via the zinc finger approach is more efficient than inhibiting the translation of many copies of mRNA via the antisense or ribozyme approaches, which seldom give >90% repression of target gene expression. (iii) Targeting two or more binding sites in the promoter of a gene of interest with two or more zinc finger proteins can give stronger repression than targeting a single site with a single zinc finger protein (8.Kim J.-S. Pabo C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29795-29800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In contrast, targeting multiple sites in an mRNA using antisense or ribozyme molecules seldom gives synergistic or additive effects. The cumulative effect of multiple zinc finger proteins on transcriptional repression may be useful not only to shut down the expression of a target gene but also to reduce the possibility of selecting resistant clones. In principle, when applied to the suppression of oncogenes or viral genes, all three approaches (zinc finger, ribozyme, and antisense) may suffer from potential problems associated with resistant clones in which point mutations have been introduced at the binding site. When two or more zinc finger proteins bind to distinctive sites, however, it would be much more rare for a mutant clone to arise, because it would require that mutations be introduced into all of the binding sites simultaneously in the same clone. (iv) The zinc finger approach is more flexible in that the zinc finger DNA-binding domains can be linked to domains from other proteins such as basal transcription factors (26.Kim J.-S. Kim J. Cepek K.L. Sharp P.A. Pabo C.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3616-3620Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), transcriptional repression domains (9.Liu Q. Segal D.J. Ghiara J.B.

A. 1998; 95: 14628-14633Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), and transcriptional activation domains (9.Liu Q. Segal D.J. Ghiara J.B. Barbas III, C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5525-5530Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 19.Choo Y. Castellanos A. Garcia-Hernandez B. Sanchez-Garcia I. Klug A. J. Mol.

A. 1998; 95: 14628-14633Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Thus, the zinc finger approach can be used both to down- and up-regulate target gene expression.The fusion of transcriptional repression domains such as the Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) domain to zinc finger proteins with the desired DNA binding specificities appears to be a powerful method for repression of target gene expression (9.Liu Q. Segal D.J. Ghiara J.B. Barbas III, C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5525-5530Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 20.Beerli R.R. Segal D.J. Dreier B. Barbas III, C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14628-14633Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that the KRAB domain, when fused to heterologous DNA-binding proteins, represses the expression of a reporter gene, even when bound to sites a few kilobase pairs upstream from the promoter of the gene (27.Margolin J.F. Friedman J.R. Meyer W.K. Vissing H. Thiesen H.J. Rauscher III, F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4509-4513Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). This property of repression at a distance may be advantageous in many cases, because the zinc finger proteins that are fused to the KRAB domain can be selected or designed to bind target sites anywhere within a few kilobase pairs from the promoter of a target gene. In contrast, if isolated zinc finger proteins (that is, without KRAB domain fusion) are used as transcriptional repressors, the binding sites must be located within a ∼70-bp region around the TATA box and the transcription start point (8.Kim J.-S.

A. 1998; 95: 14628-14633Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Thus, the zinc finger approach can be used both to down- and up-regulate target gene expression. The fusion of transcriptional repression domains such as the Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) domain to zinc finger proteins with the desired DNA binding specificities appears to be a powerful method for repression of target gene expression (9.Liu Q. Segal D.J. Ghiara J.B. Barbas III, C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5525-5530Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 20.Beerli R.R. Segal D.J. Dreier B. Barbas III, C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14628-14633Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that the KRAB domain, when fused to heterologous DNA-binding proteins, represses the expression of a reporter gene, even when bound to sites a few kilobase pairs upstream from the promoter of the gene (27.Margolin J.F. Friedman J.R. Meyer W.K. Vissing H. Thiesen H.J. Rauscher III, F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4509-4513Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). This property of repression at a distance may be advantageous in many cases, because the zinc finger proteins that are fused to the KRAB domain can be selected or designed to bind target sites anywhere within a few kilobase pairs from the promoter of a target gene. In contrast, if isolated zinc finger proteins (that is, without KRAB domain fusion) are used as transcriptional repressors, the binding sites must be located within a ∼70-bp region around the TATA box and the transcription start point (8.Kim J.-S. Pabo C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29795-29800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This restriction may impose some limitations on the choice of appropriate DNA sites. In terms of specificity, however, the targeting of critical sites around the transcription start point with isolated zinc finger proteins may be more desirable. It has been estimated that there are thousands or more adventitious binding sites in the human genome for any three-finger protein that recognizes a 9–10-bp DNA sequence. Gel shift experiments with nonspecific competitor DNA revealed that the three-finger Zif268 peptide specifically recognizes a 7–8-bp site (7.Greisman H.A. Pabo C.O. Science. 1997; 275: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 10.Kim J.-S. Pabo C.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2812-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), although its binding site covers 9–10 bp in the Zif268-DNA cocrystal structure (28.Pavletich N.P. Pabo C.O. Science. 1991; 252: 809-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that there might be about 100,000 sites in the human genome where the Zif268 peptide could bind. When isolated zinc finger proteins bind to only a few bp upstream of the TATA box or ∼50 bp downstream of the transcription start site, they exert no repression at all (8.Kim J.-S. Pabo C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29795-29800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar,26.Kim J.-S. Kim J. Cepek K.L. Sharp P.A. Pabo C.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3616-3620Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, isolated zinc finger proteins that bind to most of the numerous potential binding sites in the genome would not affect the gene expression. (One isolated report by Choo et al. (18.Choo Y. Sanchez-Garcia I. Klug A. Nature. 1994; 372: 642-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) showed that a designer zinc finger protein gave effective repression when it bound to a site far downstream of the transcription start point. However, this DNA binding event would need to block transcriptional elongation rather than transcriptional initiation. We believe that it is an exception rather than a rule that zinc finger proteins can block transcriptional elongation and not transcriptional initiation. We found that even the six-finger 268//NRE peptide that bound to the 18–20-bp DNA sites with femtomolar dissociation constants could not block transcriptional elongation in our transfection experiments, when the 268//NRE peptide was targeted to a site more than 50 bp downstream of the transcription start point (data not shown). In dramatic contrast, the six-finger peptide gave highly efficient (137-fold) repression of VP16-activated transcription, when it bound to a site near the transcription start point (Fig. 2 A), where the transcription initiation complex is formed.) Zinc finger-KRAB fusion proteins, however, are likely to affect the expression of many genes other than the intended target gene, because the KRAB domain has the ability to function at a distance. This feature of the KRAB domain may cause serious problems in the application of the zinc finger approach in transgenic organisms or in gene therapy. The zinc finger-KRAB fusion approach also may suffer from problems associated with the quenching effect of the repression domain. It seems possible that the KRAB domain of overexpressed zinc finger-KRAB fusion protein in cells may perturb the expression patterns of many genes indirectly by sequestering essential cellular transcription factors. In contrast, it is much less likely that an isolated zinc finger protein would show such pleiotropic effects on gene expression."

Both MutT and MutX are nucleoside triphosphatases that hydrolyze all canonical nucleoside triphosphates with a preference for deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP) and its oxidized form 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-deoxyguanine (8-oxo-dGTP) (4.Sakumi K.

Some Nudix hydrolases are highly specific to one substrate, but others can hydrolyze several different substrates. An example of the diversity of substrates is given by two enzymes, Aps1 fromSchizosaccharomyces pombe and YOR163w fromSaccharomyces cerevisiae, which catalyze the hydrolysis of two unrelated classes of substrates: diadenosine polyphosphates Ap5A and Ap6A, as well as diphosphoinositol polyphosphates (18.Safrany S.T.

Biol. 1999; 73: 183-207PubMed Google Scholar) has revealed that the Nudix box has a loop-helix-loop motif, which is important for the binding of a divalent cation and may also contribute to the substrate binding. ADP-ribosylation is a regulatory modification of protein in which an ADP-ribose moiety in β-NAD+ is transferred to the specific amino acid residue of an acceptor protein for cellular non-redox activities. Mono-ADP-ribosylation of protein by bacterial toxins leads to immediate cytotoxic effect (21.McDonald L.J. Moss J. Mol Cell. Biochem. 1994; 138: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The mono-ADP-ribosylation reactions have also been detected in many eukaryotic organisms catalyzed by endogenous ADP-ribosyltransferases, which may have regulatory roles in cellular processes (for review, see Ref. 22.Okazaki I.J. Moss J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1999; 19: 485-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Poly-ADP-ribosylation of a number of nuclear proteins is carried out by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases-1 and 2 in response to DNA strand breaks and resealing (23.Amé J.C. Rolli V. Schreiber V. Niedergang C. Apiou F. Decker P. Muller S. Höger T. Ménissier-de Murcia J. de Murcia G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17860-17868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). β-NAD+ can also be converted to cyclic ADP-ribose, which is a second messenger in pancreatic islets for Ca2+ mobilization in the endoplasmic reticulum to secrete insulin (24.Lee H.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 138: 229-235Google Scholar). Free ADP-ribose is produced during the reverse processes of degrading protein-bound mono- or poly(ADP-ribose), or cyclic ADP-ribose. It is also the turnover product of β-NAD+ (25.Olivera B.M. Hughes K.T. Cordray P. Roth J.R. Jacobson M.K. Jacobson E.L. ADP-Ribose Transfer Reactions. Springer-Verlag, New York1989: 353-360Crossref Google Scholar). Free ADP-ribose is a highly reactive molecule, which causes non-enzymatic mono-ADP-ribosylation of proteins. It has been speculated that free ADP-ribose could act on the targeting sites of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases or bacterial toxins, which in either case will cause change of the activity of the modified proteins leading to intracellular damage (26.Jacobson E.L. Cervantes-Laurean D. Jacobson M.K. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 138: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Despite lacking the knowledge about possible specific roles of free ADP-ribose in cellular processes, the level of ADP-ribose in the cell is expected to be carefully maintained in order to minimize the potential detrimental effect of free ADP-ribose. Free ADP-ribose is converted to AMP and ribose 5-phosphate by ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase. The activities of ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase are detected in microorganisms as well as in higher eukaryotes. So far, three genes encoding ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase activities have been identified and characterized. ORF186 from E. coli was characterized as a Nudix hydrolase with broad substrate specificity (7.O'Handley S.F. Frick D.N. Dunn C.A. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3192-3197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It catalyzes the conversion of ADP-ribose to AMP and ribose 5-phosphate. It can also catalyze the hydrolysis of Ap3A and NADH with similar efficiencies. Recently, the product of the MJ1149 gene, another Nudix hydrolase from thermophilic Archaeon Methanococcus jannaschii, was characterized as a highly specific ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase (15.Sheikh S. O'Handley S.F. Dunn C.A. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20924-20928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). A bifunctional enzyme slr0787 from Synechocystis sp. was shown to have both ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase and NMN adenylyltransferase activity (16.Raffaelli N. Lorenzi T. Amici A. Emanuelli M. Ruggieri S. Magni G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 444: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Four other Nudix hydrolases, YSA1 of S. cerevisiae (ScYSA1), ORF209 of E. coli (EcORF209), YQKG from Bacillus subtilis (BsYQKG), and Hi0398 from Hemeophilus influenzae, were briefly described to have ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase activity (1.Bessman M.J.

The functions of ADP-ribose pyrophosphatases were proposed to be the “housecleaning enzyme” that removes the highly reactive free ADP-ribose molecule as well as reutilize it after hydrolysis to form AMP and ribose 5-phosphate (1.Bessman M.J.

McLennan A.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 331-337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) published results on the cloning and characterization of human YSA1H. In this work, we report cloning and characterization of a novel Nudix hydrolase NUDT5 from human and its murine homolog mNudT5. The major substrates for NUDT5 and mNudT5 are ADP-sugars with preference to ADP-ribose. The RNA transcripts of NUDT5 and mNudT5 are expressed in all tissues analyzed with preferential expression in liver. Furthermore, the genomic structure and chromosome localization for bothNUDT5 and mNudT5 are also described. A cDNA fragment containing the NUDT5 coding region was identified in the Human Genome Sciences human cDNA sequence data base during searchs for fragments encoding protein sequence homologous to E. coli MutT using the program BLAST (31.Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9381) Google Scholar). A λ phage library containing mouse liver cDNA (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was screened using a probe containing the NUDT5 cDNA coding region obtained after PCR amplification. The hybridization and washing condition were according to the manufacturer protocols. Recombinant phages containing mNudT5 were isolated and DNA samples were prepared using protocols as described previously (32.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual,2 nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The sequencing reactions were carried out using [α-32P]dATP and a SequiTherm Cycle Sequencing Kit (Epicentre Technologies, Madison, WI). The oligonucleotides used for sequencing were synthesized on a Beckman oligo1000 DNA synthesizer (Beckman Instruments). All oligonucleotides were deprotected in ammonium hydroxide and used without further purification. NUDT5, E. coli mutT (EcmutT), and hMTH (humanmutT homolog) were cloned into the expression vector pKK388–1 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) and transformed into an E. coli mutT strain. E. coli mutTcontaining pKK388-1/NUDT5, pKK388–1/EcmutT, pKK388–1/hMTH, or the vector pKK388-1 were tested for complementation of E. coli mutT mutator phenotype using protocols as described previously (33.Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar). The NUDT5 gene was cloned between theSalI and XbaI sites of the bacterial expression vector pQE9 (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) after PCR amplification. Transformants of E. coli M15/pREP4 with the pQE9/NUDT5 were grown at 37 °C in 100 ml of LB medium with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml kanamycin. The plasmid pREP4 constitutively expresses the Lac repressor protein encoded by thelacI gene in order to reduce the basal level of expression (Qiagen). When the culture grew to A 600 of 0.7, a final concentration of 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to induce the expression of NUDT5 protein for 3 h. Bacterial lysate was prepared by French press (16,000 psi) in buffer A (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl) plus 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After clarification by centrifugation the lysate was mixed with 3 ml of Ni2+-NTA matrix (Qiagen) for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle shaking. Then the mixture was poured into a column, washed with buffer A containing 0.1 m imidazole, and eluted with buffer A containing 1 m imidazole. Western blot analysis was performed using a primary antibody (RGS·His Antibody, Qiagen) and a secondary alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody (Sigma) to monitor the recombinant NUDT5 protein during purification. The fractions containing the recombinant NUDT5 proteins were dialyzed overnight in 1 liter of buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50% glycerol) with two changes. A clear protein sample was obtained after centrifugation of the dialyzed sample, aliquots were stored at −80 °C. The mNudT5 gene was cloned between SphI andHindIII sites of the bacterial expression vector pQE30 (Qiagen) after PCR amplification. The expression condition and purification protocols were similar to those of NUDT5. A Perkin-Elmer Sciex (Thornhill, Canada) API III triple quadrupole mass spectrometer fitted with an Ion SprayTM source was tuned and calibrated as described previously (34.Glasgow B.J. Abduragimov A.R. Yusifov T.N. Gassymov O.K. Horwitz J. Hubbell W.L. Faull K.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2215-2225Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Positive ion protein spectra were produced by injection of the proteins dissolved in water onto a C8reverse phase column (Keystone Scientific BDS Hypersil C8, 100 × 1 mm, 3-μm particle size, 120 Å pore size, 20 μl/injection) equilibrated in water/acetonitrile/trifluoroacetic acid (95/5/0.1 all by volume). The column was eluted (40 μl/min) with a linearly increasing concentration of acetonitrile (2%/min) and the column eluant was passed in series through a UV detector (215 nm) and the Ionspray source. Data was recorded with the mass spectrometer scanning from m/z 400–2000 (step size 0.3 Da, dwell time 1 ms, 5.61 s/scan, orifice voltage 90). The average of the spectra contributing to the peak in ion current was computed. Calculation of molecular mass from the series of multiply charged ions found in the protein was achieved with the MacSpecTMcomputer program (version 3.3, PE Sciex, Ontario, Canada). Calculation of theoretical protein average (chemical) molecular mass was achieved with the MacBiospecTM computer program (version 1.0.1, PE Sciex) based on the MacProMAss computer program of Lee and Vermuri (35.Lee T.D. Vemuri S. Biomed. Environ. Mass Spectrom. 1990; 19: 639-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A slightly modified colorimetric procedure (15.Sheikh S. O'Handley S.F. Dunn C.A. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20924-20928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) was used to assay the hydrolysis of the substrates. A standard reaction mixture contained (in 50 μl): 50 mm Tris, pH 7.0 (for NUDT5) or pH 9.0 (for mNudT5), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm substrate, 1 unit of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase, and 140 ng of NUDT5 or 400 ng of mNudT5. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, terminated by the addition 250 μl of 20 mm EDTA. The inorganic orthophosphate produced was quantified by the colorimetric assay of Ames and Dubin (36.Ames B.N. Dubin D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 769-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For product identification by electrospray mass spectrometry, the calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase was omitted from the standard assay. Spectra of reaction mixtures were obtained by flow injection analysis of samples diluted (2/100) in water/acetonitrile/triethylamine (50/50/0.1, all by volume). Aliquots of the solution (10–20 μl) were injected into a stream of the same solvent entering the Ion Spray sourceTM (10 μl/min) while the mass spectrometer was scanning in the negative ion mode from 200 to 1000 Da (0.3 Da step size, 5.47 s/scan, orifice voltage 60–80). Mouse multiple tissue Northern (MTNTM) blot containing 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from various adult tissues (CLONTECH) was hybridized with a 32P-random primed 300-bpmNudT5 cDNA fragment containing exon 1–4 (Prime-It II kit, Stratagene). The hybridization and washing conditions were according to the manufacturer protocol “Multiple Tissue Expression Array User Manual.” The blot was hybridized at 65 °C overnight and washed in solution 1 (2 × SSC and 1% SDS) 5 times at 65 °C for 20 min and twice in solution 2 (0.1 × SSC and 0.5% SDS) at 55 °C for 20 min. The blot was stripped by incubation for 10 min in 0.5% SDS at 90–100 °C and reprobed with β-actin cDNA control probe. The Human Multiple Tissue Expression (MTETM) Array (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) hybridization was carried out according to the manufacturer protocol “Multiple Tissue Expression Array User Manual” with a 32P-random-primed 700-bp NUDT5 cDNA PCR probe containing the coding region (Prime-It II kit, Stratagene). The blot was washed under the same condition as for the MTN blot (see above). A λ phage library containing mouse genomic DNA (strain 129 Svj, Stratagene) was screened using a NUDT5 cDNA probe containing the coding region. The recombinant phage was isolated and the DNA sample was prepared using protocols as described previously (32.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual,2 nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The DNA was partially sequenced with primers designed on the basis ofmNudT5 cDNA sequence to obtain the intron-exon organization. The 3′ end of mNudT5 gene containing exons 7–9 was obtained from two overlapping PCR products from mouse genomic DNA (strain 129 Svj). The PCR products were cloned in pCR2.1-TOPO vector using TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and partially sequenced. The sizes of introns were obtained from either sequencing of the genomic clone (introns 1, 3–5, and 7) or from PCR analysis (introns 2, 6, and 8). To determine the exon-intron organization of the NUDT5 gene, 8 sets of PCR primers were designed to construct a contig of genomic DNA fragments covering the NUDT5 locus. Human genomic DNA (CLONTECH) was used for PCR. PCR products were analyzed on agarose gel, cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector using TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen), and partially sequenced to obtain the exon-intron organization. The sequences of primers are available upon request. Radiation hybrid mapping technique was used to map both mNudT5 andNUDT5. The 100 cell lines of the T31 radiation hybrid panel, which carries fragments of the mouse genome on a hamster background (37.McCarthy L.C. Terrett J. Davis M.E. Knights C.J. Smith A.L. Critcher R. Schmitt K. Hudson J. Spurr N.K. Goodfellow P.N. Genome Res. 1997; 7: 1153-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), were used as templates for PCR amplification with mNudT5 primers 5′-CAAAGAACCCTGCACCATGA-3′, and 5′-TACCTACCTGGCTTTCACAC-3′ derived from the sequence expanding the region of exon 4-intron 4 of themNudT5 genomic DNA. Reactions were performed with 112.5 ng of hybrid clone DNA, 0.4 μm each primer, 250 nm each dNTP, 0.625 units of TaKaRa Ex Taqpolymerase (TaKaRa Shuzo Co., Japan) and the supplied buffer, in a total volume of 25 μl. After an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min, 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 62 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1.5 min were performed, followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. The PCR products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis in 1.2% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide, and scored for the presence or absence of the 230-bp product. In preliminary experiments, a single DNA band of expected size 230 bp was detected using mouse genomic DNA as template while no product was detected using hamster genomic DNA as template. Two independent reactions were performed with mNudT5 primers for the entire T31 panel. All data were submitted to the Jackson Laboratory Mouse Radiation Hybrid Data base for mapping analysis. The 93 cell lines of the Gene Bridge 4 (GB4) radiation hybrid panel, which carries fragments of the human genome on a hamster background (38.Gyapay G. Schmitt K. Fizames C. Jones H. Vega-Czarny N. Spillett D. Muselet D. Prud'Homme J.F. Dib C. Auffray C. Morissette J. Weissenbach J. Goodfellow P.N. Human Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), were used as templates for PCR amplification withNUDT5 primers 5′-TCGTAAAATAAAAGCACAGAAC-3′ and 5′-CTGGACTAGAAAAGTAACTGAGCTGT-3′derived from the 3′-untranslated region of the NUDT5 cDNA. PCR conditions were the same as described above for the mNudT5 gene. In preliminary experiments, a single DNA band of expected size 190 bp was detected using human genomic DNA as template while no product was detected using hamster genomic DNA as template. Two independent reactions were performed with NUDT5 primers for the entire GB4 panel. All data were submitted to the Whitehead Institute/MIT Center for Genome Research's Human Radiation Hybrid Data base for mapping analysis. Distance analysis was performed using neighbor joining in the PAUP program (39.Swofford D.L. PAUP*: Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony (*and Other Methods), Version 4. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA1999Google Scholar). A multiple sequence alignment of the “MutT” domain was retrieved from the Pfam website (40.Sonnhammer E.L. Eddy S.R. Birney E. Bateman A. Durbin R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 320-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Representative sequences were selected from the Pfam alignment and five additional sequences were manually added (NUDT5, mNudT5, Tm, Pa, and Ap, see Fig. 10, legend). During the search for DNA repair genes in the Human Genome Sciences human cDNA sequence data base, a clone was identified, which encodes a protein of 28.5 and 21.8% amino acid identity to E. coliMutT and hMTH (41.Genetics Computer GroupProgram Manual for the GCG Package, Version 7. Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI1991Google Scholar), respectively. The nucleotide sequence of the full-length cDNA (1129 base pairs) is shown in Fig.1. It contains an open reading frame (ORF) of 660 nucleotides from the first translation initiation codon ATG to the termination codon TAA (nucleotides 120–779). An in-frame stop codon is located 39 base pairs upstream of the initiation codon. The complete ORF encodes a protein of 219 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 24357 Da and pI 4.8 (42.DNASTAR Inc Program Manual for the EditSeq Package. DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI1992Google Scholar). We confirmed the nucleotide sequence of 5′-nontranslated region with sequences obtained from the BLAST search (31.Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9381) Google Scholar). Of the six sequences from the GenBank that contained the 5′-nontranslated region (accession numbers: AA306176, AA306565,AA490510, W07480, W16891, and W92824), all of them contained the in-frame stop codon before the translation initiation codon ATG. The Nudix signature sequences of this ORF protein, together with E. coli MutT, hMTH, and other characterized Nudix hydrolases with unique substrate specificity are shown in TableI. The ORF protein contains the conserved amino acid residues in the Nudix signature sequence, which recently has been designated as NUDT5 on the website of the Human Gene Nomenclature Committee. One feature in NUDT5 Nudix sequence is Tyr-119, which is not a bulk amino acid like Ile, Leu, or Val as in the majority of other Nudix signature sequences.Table INudix signature sequences of NUDT5 with other Nudix hydrolasesAccessionOrganismEnzymeSubstrateNudix boxRef.AF218818H. sapiensNUDT5ADP-ribose, ADP-mannoseGLIDDGETPEAAALRELEEETGYThis workP08337E. coliMutTdGTP, 8-oxo-dGTPGKIEMGETPEQAVVRELQEEVGI46P36639H. sapiensMTHdGTP, 8-oxo-dGTPGKVQEGETIEDGARRELQEESGL4D64443M. jannaschiiADPRibaseADP-riboseGFVECGETVEEAVVREIKEETGL15P36651E. coliORF209ADP-riboseGMIEEGESVEDVARREAIEEAGL1P45799E. coliORF186Ap3A, ADP-ribose, NADHGLIDPGESVYEAANRELKEEVGF7P32664E. coliORF257NADHGFVEVGETLEQAVAREVMEESGI13P32056E. coliORF1.9GDP-mannoseGRVQKDETLEAAFERLTMAELGL14P24236E. coliORF17dATPGSVEEGETAPQAAMREVKEEVTI6P50583H. sapiensAp4AaseAp4AGHVEPGEDDLETALRETQEEAGI9Q09790S. pombeAps1Ap5A,Ap6A,PP-lnsP5,[PP]2-lnsP4GGWEADESVQQAALREGWEEGGL18G XXXXX E XXXXXXX REU X EE X GU U=I, L,VConcensusThe conserved amino acid residues in Nudix box are in bold.

A cDNA clone of a murine NUDT5 homolog (mNudT5) from mouse liver cDNA library was identified using NUDT5 cDNA sequence as a probe. It contains a 934-bp cDNA sequence with an open reading frame of 657-bp encoding a predicted protein product of 218 amino acids. The mNudT5 has 81% amino acid identity to the NUDT5 (Fig. 2) with a predicted molecular mass of 23986 Da and pI of 5.3 (42.DNASTAR Inc Program M"
https://openalex.org/W2100690271,"Previous studies have provided detailed information on the formation of spherical high density lipoproteins (HDL) containing apolipoprotein (apo) A-I but no apoA-II (A-I HDL) by an lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT)-mediated process. In this study we have investigated the formation of spherical HDL containing both apoA-I and apoA-II (A-I/A-II HDL). Incubations were carried out containing discoidal A-I reconstituted HDL (rHDL), discoidal A-II rHDL, and low density lipoproteins in the absence or presence of LCAT. After the incubation, the rHDL were reisolated and subjected to immunoaffinity chromatography to determine whether A-I/A-II rHDL were formed. In the absence of LCAT, the majority of the rHDL remained as either A-I rHDL or A-II rHDL, with only a small amount of A-I/A-II rHDL present. By contrast, when LCAT was present, a substantial proportion of the reisolated rHDL were A-I/A-II rHDL. The identity of the particles was confirmed using apoA-I rocket electrophoresis. The formation of the A-I/A-II rHDL was influenced by the relative concentrations of the precursor discoidal A-I and A-II rHDL. The A-I/A-II rHDL included several populations of HDL-sized particles; the predominant population having a Stokes' diameter of 9.9 nm. The particles were spherical in shape and had an electrophoretic mobility slightly slower than that of the α-migrating HDL in human plasma. The apoA-I:apoA-II molar ratio of the A-I/A-II rHDL was 0.7:1. Their major lipid constituents were phospholipids, unesterified cholesterol, and cholesteryl esters. The results presented are consistent with LCAT promoting fusion of the A-I rHDL and A-II rHDL to form spherical A-I/A-II rHDL. We suggest that this process may be an important source of A-I/A-II HDL in human plasma.

Clay M.A. Barter P.J. Atherosclerosis. 1999; 145: 227-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). HDL contain two main apolipoproteins: apolipoprotein (apo)A-I and apoA-II, which account for 70 and 20%, respectively, of HDL protein. These apolipoproteins define two apolipoprotein-specific HDL subpopulations (2.Cheung M.C. Albers J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12201-12209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar): A-I HDL, which contain apoA-I but no apoA-II, and A-I/A-II HDL, which contain both apoA-I and apoA-II. The presence of apoA-II in HDL reduces their ability to protect against atherosclerosis (3.Amouyel P. Isorez D. Bard J.-M. Goldman M. Lebel P. Zylberberg G. Fruchart J.C. Arterioscler.

Verstuyft J.G. Gong E.L. Nichols A.V. Rubin E.M. Nature. 1993; 365: 762-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). ApoA-I is synthesized in the liver and intestine and secreted into plasma mainly as discoidal particles containing apoA-I complexed with phospholipids (6.Green P.H.R. Glickman R.M. J. Lipid Res. 1981; 22: 1153-1173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Hamilton R.L. Williams M.C. Fielding C.J. Havel R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1976; 58: 667-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Discoidal A-I HDL are also formed extracellularly by the interaction of lipid-poor apoA-I with phospholipids and unesterified cholesterol from other plasma lipoproteins or cell membranes (8.Clay M.A. Barter P.J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1722-1732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Forte T.M. Bielecki J.K. Goth-Goldstein R. Selmek J. McCall M.R. J.

Lipid-poor apoA-I is generated within the plasma as a product of the remodeling of HDL by plasma factors such as cholesteryl ester transfer protein (11.Liang H.-Q. Rye K.-A. Barter P.J. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1187-1199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Rye K.-A. Hime N.J. Barter P.J. J. Biol.

J. 1996; 313: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and hepatic lipase (14.Clay M.A. Rye K.-A. Barter P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1044: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Once formed, discoidal A-I HDL are excellent substrates for lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), which rapidly esterifies their cholesterol (15.Francone O.L. Gurakar A. Fielding C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7066-7072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cholesteryl esters that are formed partition into the center of the particles in a process that converts the discs into spherical A-I HDL (16.Nichols A.V. Blanche P.J. Gong E.L. Shore V.G. Forte T.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 834: 285-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). LCAT also promotes the fusion of A-I HDL particles in a process that increases the number of apoA-I molecules/particle (17.Liang H.-Q. Rye K.-A. Barter P.J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1962-1970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which apoA-II becomes a component of spherical A-I/A-II HDL is not known. ApoA-II is secreted from the liver into the plasma either as discoidal A-II HDL (18.Zannis V.I. Breslow J.L. SanGiacomo T.R. Aden D.P. Knowles B.B. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 7089-7096Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) or in a lipid-poor form (19.Forte T.M. McCall M.R. Knowles B.B. Shore V.G. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 817-829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), where it acquires phospholipids from cell membranes in a process that forms discoidal particles (9.Forte T.M. Bielecki J.K. Goth-Goldstein R. Selmek J. McCall M.R. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 148-157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, unlike discoidal A-I HDL, discoidal A-II HDL are nonreactive with LCAT (9.Forte T.M. Bielecki J.K. Goth-Goldstein R. Selmek J. McCall M.R. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 148-157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Jonas A. Sweeny S.A. Herbert P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6369-6375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and are therefore not converted into spherical particles. In this paper, we show that spherical A-I/A-II reconstituted HDL (rHDL) can be assembled from discoidal A-I rHDL and discoidal A-II rHDL in a fusion process promoted by LCAT. This finding represents the first demonstration of a physiological mechanism by which spherical A-I/A-II HDL may be formed. It also provides a new model with which to investigate how apoA-II impacts on the structure, function, and metabolism of HDL. Plasma was obtained from normal volunteers who had fasted for 12 h. HDL (1.063 < d < 1.21 g/ml) and LDL (1.019 < d < 1.055 g/ml) were isolated from pooled human plasma (Transfusion Service, Royal Adelaide Hospital, Australia) by sequential ultracentrifugation in a Beckman L8–70 m ultracentrifuge (21.Rye K.-A. Garrety K.H. Barter P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1167: 316-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Human apoA-I and apoA-II were purified to homogeneity following delipidation of HDL (22.Osborne J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and chromatography on a column of Q Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (23.Rye K.-A. Garrety K.H. Barter P.J. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 215-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lipoproteins and lipid-free apolipoproteins were dialyzed against Tris-buffered saline (0.01 m Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.15 mNaCl, 0.01% (w/v) EDTA-Na2, and 0.02% (w/v) NaN3) prior to use in incubations. LCAT was isolated from pooled human plasma as described previously (24.Rye K.-A. Hime N.J. Barter P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4243-4250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Activity of the preparations was determined using discoidal rHDL prelabeled with [3H]cholesterol (25.Piran U. Morin R.J. J. Lipid Res. 1979; 20: 1040-1043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of each LCAT preparation is included in the legends to the Figures and Tables. Discoidal rHDL were prepared by the cholate dialysis method (26.Matz C.E. Jonas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4535-4540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (Sigma), unesterified cholesterol (Sigma), and either apoA-I or apoA-II. The final molar ratio (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine:unesterified cholesterol:protein) of the particles was 68:5:1 and 72:5:1 for the A-I rHDL and the A-II rHDL, respectively. Discoidal A-I rHDL and A-II rHDL made according to this method have 2 molecules of apoA-I and 4 molecules of apoA-II/particle, respectively (23.Rye K.-A. Garrety K.H. Barter P.J. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 215-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Jonas A. Sweeny S.A. Herbert P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6369-6375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rHDL were dialyzed against 5 × 1 liter Tris-buffered saline prior to use in incubations. Various combinations of discoidal A-I rHDL, discoidal A-II rHDL, LCAT, LDL, bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma), and β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma) were incubated at 37 °C in sealed tubes for 24 h in a shaking water bath. Details of the individual incubations are described in the legends to the Figures and Tables. All incubations were terminated by placing the tubes on ice. After the incubations, the HDL density fraction of 1.1–1.25 g/ml was isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation with two 16-h spins at 100,000 rpm at the lower density and a single 16-h spin at 100,000 rpm at the higher density. A Beckman 100.4 Ti rotor and a Beckman TL-100 Tabletop ultracentrifuge maintained at 4 °C were used for these procedures. Aliquots of the HDL density fraction were subjected to immunoaffinity chromatography to isolate A-I/A-II rHDL. The reisolated rHDL were then characterized by nondenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, immunoblot analysis, agarose gel electrophoresis, apoA-I rocket electrophoresis, and electron microscopy and assayed for lipids and apolipoproteins as described below. Antisera to purified human apoA-I and apoA-II were raised in sheep and purified by affinity chromatography as described previously (28.Clay M.A. Cehic D.A. Pyle D.H. Rye K.-A. Barter P.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 445-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). ApoA-I antibody preparations were monospecific to human apoA-I, and apoA-II antibody preparations were monospecific to human apoA-II, as judged by immunoblots against purified human apoA-I, apoA-II, and albumin. Human apoA-I and human apoA-II antibody preparations were covalently coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B at a ratio of 1:1 (v:v) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The capacity of the anti-apoA-I-Sepharose was 200–300 μg of apoA-I/ml of gel, and the capacity of the anti-apoA-II-Sepharose was 110–130 μg of apoA-II/ml of gel. Aliquots of the HDL density fraction, which had been isolated from the incubations, were rotated with either anti-apoA-I-Sepharose or anti-apoA-II-Sepharose for 1 h at room temperature in sealed Polyprep chromatography columns. HDL particles that did not bind to the columns were washed off with Tris-buffered saline (8 column volumes). The column was then washed with 6 column volumes of 0.1 m acetic acid (pH 2.7). HDL particles that had bound to the column generally eluted in 1.5–2 column volumes of acetic acid. They were neutralized immediately with 1 mTris (pH 11.0). The final concentration of Tris in the fractions was 0.09 m. Aliquots of rHDL were subjected to apoA-I rocket electrophoresis using commercially available LpAI hydragels, which contain antibodies to human apoA-I and human apoA-II (Sebia, Issy-les-Moulineaux, France). This is an established analytical technique that separates HDL containing only apoA-I (and no apoA-II) from those containing apoA-II (including A-I/A-II HDL and A-II HDL) (29.Parra H.J. Mezdour H. Ghalim N. Bard J.M. Fruchart J.C. Clin. Chem. 1990; 36: 1431-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The gels were run according to manufacturer's instructions and stained with acid violet solution. Aliquots of the A-I/A-II rHDL were electrophoresed for 3000 V/h on 3–40% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gradient gels, stained with Coomassie Blue G-250, and destained with acetic acid (14.Clay M.A. Rye K.-A. Barter P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1044: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Gels were prepared according to the method of Rainwater et al. (30.Rainwater D.L. Andres D.W. Ford A.L. Lowe F. Blanche P.J. Krauss R.M. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1876-1881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Stokes' diameter of the particles was calculated with reference to standards in a high molecular mass electrophoresis calibration kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In some experiments, duplicate samples of A-I/A-II rHDL were electrophoresed on 3–40% nondenaturing gradient gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (8.Clay M.A. Barter P.J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1722-1732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To compare the distribution of apoA-I and apoA-II in the isolated particles, half of the membrane was immunoblotted for apoA-I and a duplicate half was immunoblotted for apoA-II (28.Clay M.A. Cehic D.A. Pyle D.H. Rye K.-A. Barter P.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 445-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Aliquots of isolated A-I/A-II rHDL were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis as described previously (28.Clay M.A. Cehic D.A. Pyle D.H. Rye K.-A. Barter P.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 445-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Each gel included one track of purified lipid-free apoA-I as a marker of pre-β migrating particles and one track of HDL (density fraction 1.063–1.21 g/ml) isolated from human plasma as a marker of α-migrating particles. Electron microscopy of the isolated A-I/A-II rHDL was performed as described previously (31.Forte T.M. Nordhausen R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 442-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). All assays were performed on a Cobas-Fara centrifugal analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Zurich, Switzerland). Concentrations of total cholesterol, unesterified cholesterol, and phospholipids were measured using enzymatic kits (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The concentration of cholesteryl esters was calculated as the difference between the concentrations of total and unesterified cholesterol. Concentrations of apoA-I and apoA-II were measured immunoturbidometrically as described previously (28.Clay M.A. Cehic D.A. Pyle D.H. Rye K.-A. Barter P.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 445-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), using antisera raised in sheep to human apoA-I (described above) or apoA-II (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The assay was standardized using appropriate dilutions of either lipid-free apoA-I or apoA-II purified from human plasma as described above. A mixture of discoidal A-I rHDL and discoidal A-II rHDL was supplemented with LDL (as a source of unesterified cholesterol for the LCAT reaction), BSA, and β-mercaptoethanol and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h in the absence or presence of LCAT. After the incubation, the rHDL (1.1–1.25 g/ml) were reisolated by ultracentrifugation. To determine whether A-I/A-II rHDL particles were formed during the incubations, the rHDL were subjected to immunoaffinity chromatography on either an anti-apoA-I-Sepharose column or an anti-apoA-II-Sepharose column. To confirm the integrity of the columns, we showed quantitative binding of A-I rHDL to the anti-apoA-I column and A-II rHDL to the anti-apoA-II column (results not shown). Conversely, A-II rHDL did not bind to the anti-apoA-I column, and A-I rHDL did not bind to the anti-apoA-II column (results not shown). Incubation of A-I rHDL or A-II rHDL alone with LCAT had no effect on the binding of either preparation to the anti-apoA-I or the anti-apoA-II column, respectively (results not shown). Thus, any apoA-II that bound to the anti-apoA-I column and any apoA-I that bound to the anti-apoA-II column must, by definition, have been accommodated in A-I/A-II rHDL particles.Table IFormation of A-I/A-II rHDL in the absence or presence of LCATReisolated rHDL bound to column (% of apoA-I or apoA-II loaded)ApoA-IApoA-IIExperiment 1Experiment 2Experiment 1Experiment 2A.

Two separate experiments were conducted; in both cases incubations were conducted in the absence (A) or presence (B) of LCAT (17 and 5.25 ml of LCAT in experiments 1 and 2, respectively). The LCAT activity was 426 nmol of cholesterol esterified/h/ml of LCAT in experiment 1 and 930 nmol of cholesterol esterified/h/ml of LCAT in experiment 2. The final incubation volumes were 60 and 35 ml in experiments 1 and 2, respectively. After the incubation, the total rHDL fraction was reisolated and subjected to immunoaffinity chromatography on either an anti-apoA-I-Sepharose column or an anti-apoA-II-Sepharose column. The amount of rHDL loaded on the anti-apoA-I column was equivalent to 250 μg of apoA-I/ml of gel. The amount of rHDL loaded on the anti-apoA-II column was equivalent to 110 μg of apoA-II/ml of gel. The amount of reisolated rHDL that had bound to the column was calculated as the difference between the apoA-I or apoA-II that was loaded on the column and that which was washed off the column at neutral pH. Results are the mean of triplicate determinations. Open table in a new tab Discoidal A-I rHDL (final concentration 143 μg of apoA-I/ml of incubation mixture) were incubated with discoidal A-II rHDL (final concentration 171 μg of apoA-II/ml of incubation mixture) at 37 °C for 24 h with LDL (final concentration 500 μg of apoB/ml of incubation mixture), BSA (3% w/v), and β-mercaptoethanol (final concentration 4.4 mm). Two separate experiments were conducted; in both cases incubations were conducted in the absence (A) or presence (B) of LCAT (17 and 5.25 ml of LCAT in experiments 1 and 2, respectively).

The final incubation volumes were 60 and 35 ml in experiments 1 and 2, respectively. After the incubation, the total rHDL fraction was reisolated and subjected to immunoaffinity chromatography on either an anti-apoA-I-Sepharose column or an anti-apoA-II-Sepharose column. The amount of rHDL loaded on the anti-apoA-I column was equivalent to 250 μg of apoA-I/ml of gel. The amount of rHDL loaded on the anti-apoA-II column was equivalent to 110 μg of apoA-II/ml of gel. The amount of reisolated rHDL that had bound to the column was calculated as the difference between the apoA-I or apoA-II that was loaded on the column and that which was washed off the column at neutral pH. Results are the mean of triplicate determinations. In incubations conducted in the absence of LCAT, 12.5–20% of the apoA-II in the reisolated rHDL mixture bound to the anti-apoA-I-Sepharose column and 0–14% of the apoA-I bound to the anti-apoA-II-Sepharose column (Table I A). Thus, in the absence of LCAT, the majority of the particles remained as either A-I rHDL or A-II rHDL, with only a small amount of A-I/A-II particles present. In contrast, when the incubations contained LCAT, 31–93% of the apoA-II in the reisolated rHDL bound to the anti-apoA-I-Sepharose column, and 51–64% of the apoA-I bound to the anti-apoA-II-Sepharose column (Table I B). Thus, in the presence of LCAT, a substantial proportion of the reisolated rHDL were A-I/A-II rHDL. The results described above showed that LCAT promoted the formation of A-I/A-II rHDL from precursor discoidal A-I and A-II rHDL. Given that these experiments were carried out at a single concentration of the precursor particles, we next asked whether the formation of A-I/A-II rHDL was influenced by differences in the relative concentrations of the A-I and A-II discoidal rHDL. Studies were conducted with mixtures containing varying proportions of the discoidal particles. A constant amount of discoidal A-I rHDL was incubated with LDL and LCAT for 24 h at 37 °C in the presence of increasing concentrations of discoidal A-II rHDL. Following the incubation, the rHDL were reisolated and subjected to immunoaffinity chromatography on an anti-apoA-I-Sepharose column. In each case, virtually all of the apoA-I in the reisolated rHDL fractions bound to the column (Table II), as indicated by the absence of any measurable apoA-I in the unbound fraction. As the concentration of discoidal A-II rHDL increased, there was an increase in the amount of apoA-II that bound to the anti-apoA-I column, consistent with an increase in the amount of A-I/A-II rHDL formed. At the lower concentrations of apoA-II, all of the apoA-II in the reisolated rHDL also bound to the anti-apoA-I column showing that, under these conditions, all of the apoA-II resided in A-I/A-II rHDL. At higher concentrations of discoidal A-II rHDL, a proportion of the apoA-II did not bind to the column, indicating that it remained as a component of A-II rHDL. This finding may, however, reflect the high amounts of precursor discoidal rHDL present. Under these conditions, the amount of LCAT present may not have been sufficient to promote the fusion of all of the discoidal A-II rHDL with A-I rHDL. Any A-II rHDL that remained would not have bound to the anti-apoA-I column.Table IIEffect of an increasing concentration of discoidal A-II rHDL and a constant concentration of discoidal A-I rHDL on the formation of A-I/A-II rHDLIncubation mixtureReisolated rHDL loaded on anti-apoA-I-Sepharose columnReisolated rHDL bound to anti-apoA-I-Sepharose column (% of apoA-I or apoA-II loaded)Height of rocketsDiscoidal A-I rHDLDiscoidal A-II rHDLApoA-IApoA-IIApoA-IApoA-IIFaint rocket (A-I-only rHDL)Dark rocket (A-I/A-II rHDL)μg of apolipoprotein/mlμgmm1432179519510010013.93.4143436533061001007.43.1143867025161006912.46.5A constant amount of discoidal A-I rHDL was incubated with increasing concentrations of discoidal A-II rHDL at 37 °C for 24 h with LDL (final concentration 500 μg of apoB/ml of incubation mixture), LCAT (4.5 ml), BSA (3% w/v), and β-mercaptoethanol (final concentration 4.4 mm). The LCAT activity was 426 nmol of cholesterol esterified/h/ml of LCAT. The final incubation volume was 10.5 ml. After the incubation, the rHDL fraction was reisolated and subjected to immunoaffinity chromatography on an anti-apoA-I-Sepharose column. The amount of reisolated rHDL that had bound to the column was calculated as the difference between the apoA-I or apoA-II that was loaded on the column and that which was washed off the column at neutral pH. The results are from a representative experiment and are the mean of triplicate determinations. The rHDL that had bound to and was eluted from the anti-apoA-I-Sepharose column was subjected to apoA-I rocket electrophoresis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab A constant amount of discoidal A-I rHDL was incubated with increasing concentrations of discoidal A-II rHDL at 37 °C for 24 h with LDL (final concentration 500 μg of apoB/ml of incubation mixture), LCAT (4.5 ml), BSA (3% w/v), and β-mercaptoethanol (final concentration 4.4 mm).

The results are from a representative experiment and are the mean of triplicate determinations. The rHDL that had bound to and was eluted from the anti-apoA-I-Sepharose column was subjected to apoA-I rocket electrophoresis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Binding of rHDL to an anti-apoA-I-Sepharose column indicates the presence of apoA-I in the particle, regardless of whether the apoA-I is in A-I rHDL or A-I/A-II rHDL. To confirm that both A-I rHDL and A-I/A-II rHDL were present, the bound rHDL were eluted from the column and subjected to apoA-I rocket electrophoresis (Table II). This is an established technique used to detect A-I HDL and A-I/A-II HDL in human serum (29.Parra H.J. Mezdour H. Ghalim N. Bard J.M. Fruchart J.C. Clin. Chem. 1990; 36: 1431-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Human HDL generates two rockets; the height of the higher, fainter rocket is proportional to the amount of A-I HDL and the lower, darker rocket corresponds to HDL particles containing apoA-II (including A-I/A-II HDL and A-II HDL) (29.Parra H.J. Mezdour H. Ghalim N. Bard J.M. Fruchart J.C. Clin. Chem. 1990; 36: 1431-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In the experiments shown in Table II, A-I rHDL and A-I/A-II rHDL were detected under all incubation conditions. As the concentration of discoidal A-II rHDL increased, there was evidence of an increase in the proportion of A-I/A-II rHDL relative to A-I rHDL (Table II). This observation is consistent with the increasing amount of apoA-II binding to the anti-apoA-I column as described above. To determine the effect of increasing the concentration of discoidal A-I rHDL on the formation of A-I/A-II rHDL, mixtures of discoidal A-II rHDL, LDL, and LCAT were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C with increasing concentrations of discoidal A-I rHDL. Following the incubations, the rHDL were reisolated by ultracentrifugation and subjected to immunoaffinity chromatography on an anti-apoA-I-Sepharose column. Irrespective of the initial concentration of discoidal A-I rHDL, all of the apoA-I and all of the apoA-II in each of the reisolated rHDL fractions bound to the anti-apoA-I column (Table III), as indicated by an absence of apoA-I and apoA-II in the unbound fractions. Thus, under the incubation conditions used in this experiment, all of the apoA-II resided in A-I/A-II rHDL particles. As the concentration of discoidal A-I rHDL increased, there was an increase in the amount of apoA-I that bound to the anti-apoA-I column, whereas the amount of apoA-II that bound to the column remained constant (Table III). This result is consistent with no change in the amount of A-I/A-II rHDL, but an increase in the amount of A-I rHDL when increasing concentrations of precursor A-I rHDL particles are present.Table IIIEffect of an increasing concentration of discoidal A-I rHDL and a constant concentration of discoidal A-II rHDL on the formation of A-I/A-II rHDLIncubation mixtureReisolated rHDL loaded on anti-apoA-I-Sepharose columnReisolated rHDL bound to anti-apoA-I-Sepharose column (% of apoA-I or apoA-II loaded)Height of rocketsDiscoidal"

We analyzed 2.1 kilobases of the 5′-flanking region of the human LTC4S gene, which contains three DNase I hypersensitivity sites, for its transcriptional activity when fused to a promoterless and enhancerless luciferase gene. Deletion analysis revealed a nonspecific basal promoter region between nucleotides −122 and −56 upstream of the translation start site which contains a consensus Sp1 binding site and a putative initiator element (Inr) and cell-specific enhancer regions further upstream. A single mutation of either the Sp1 binding site between nucleotides −120 and −115 or the Inr (CAGAC) between nucleotides −66 and −62 reduced the expression of the reporter gene by ∼60%, whereas double mutations decreased the expression by ∼80%. The incubation of nuclear extracts from THP-1 and K562 cells with a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide containing the Sp1 site or the Inr sequence gave gel-shifted complexes that were blocked by their respective cold oligonucleotides, and antisera specific for Sp1 and Sp3 provided supershifts for the former. Linker-scanning mutations of a cell-specific regulatory region revealed that mutations from nucleotides −165 to −125 reduced reporter activity. This region contains a tandem CACCC repeat (at nucleotides −149 to −145 and −139 to −135). An oligonucleotide containing the distal CACCC motif was gel shifted by THP-1 cell nuclear extract and was supershifted by antisera to Sp1 and Sp3. Cotransfection of an Sp1 expression plasmid into Drosophila SL2 cells with a −228 to −3 LTC4S reporter construct transactivated the reporter gene, whereas mutations at the CACCC repeat region reduced Sp1 transactivation by ∼66%. Similarly, the Kruppel-like factor Zf9/CPBP (core promoter-binding protein) transactivated the −228 construct in COS cells but not its CACCC mutant construct. These findings indicate the involvement of Sp1 and an Inr in non-cell-specific regulation and a Kruppel-like transcription factor and Sp1 in the cell-specific regulation of the LTC4S gene.

LTC4S is an 18-kDa perinuclear membrane protein that functions as a dimer (1.Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Vaillancourt J.P. Calaycay J.R. Mumford R.A. Zamboni R.J. Ford-Hutchinson A.W. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The MAPEG family members include the following: 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein, which is required for 5-lipoxygenase to metabolize released arachidonic acid to LTA4; microsomal GSH S-transferase II and III, enzymes that are important in cellular protection mechanisms such as detoxification of xenobiotics and the peroxidation of lipid hydroperoxides (7.Jakobsson P.J.

Thus, the MAPEG is the only superfamily with members that are critical to both the lipoxygenase pathway and the cyclooxygenase pathway of the arachidonic acid cascade.LTC4S is solely committed to the conjugation of LTA4 to GSH and does not utilize xenobiotics as an alternative substrate. Site-directed mutational analysis of the catalytic mechanism for LTC4S suggested that Arg-51 is involved in the opening of the epoxide ring of the LTA4 and that Tyr-93 is responsible for GSH thiolate anion formation with resultant conjugation of the epoxide ring with the thiolate anion to yield LTC4 (2.Lam B.K.

Arg-51 of LTC4S is conserved in other members of the MAPEG family with catalytic function. Only Tyr-93 is conserved in 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein, which has no known enzymatic function.The human LTC4S gene is mapped to the 5q35 region of human chromosome 5 (10.Penrose J.F.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), the developmental expression of LTC4S in in vitrostudies of the human eosinophil and the mouse mast cell prompts an initial focus on transcriptional regulation of this selectively expressed gene.We now report the identification of multiple cis-acting elements in the LTC4S promoter, including a proximal initiator-like element CAGAC (nucleotides −66 to −62) functioning in concert with an Sp1 site (nucleotides −120 to −115) to provide basal transcription and an upstream cell-specific cis-acting element CACCC (nucleotides −149 to −145) transactivated by Zf9/core promoter-binding protein (CPBP), a Kruppel-like factor, and Sp1. Within the context of the MAPEG superfamily of genes involved in the metabolism of released arachidonic acid, this is the first report of enhancing transacting factors functioning in concert with a TATA-less basal initiator complex to regulate expression in transfected cells.DISCUSSIONThe regulatory cis-acting elements and candidate transcription factors for the proximal core promoter involved in the transcription of the human LTC4S gene in THP-1 cells are described in the present study and depicted schematically in Fig.7. The core promoter of the LTC4S gene is located within 228 bp upstream of the translation start site and is composed of a non-cell-specific basal promoter region and a cell-specific upstream enhancer region. The basal promoter region contains an Inr-binding motif of CAGAC and an Sp1 binding GC box, whereas the enhancer region contains a tandem CACCC site that binds Sp1 and a Kruppel-like transcription factor.Deletional analysis of 2.1 kb of the 5′-flanking sequence of the human LTC4S gene revealed that two regions (nucleotides −557 to −228 and −175 to −122) were responsible for cell-specific promoter activity in THP-1 cells (Fig. 2, A and C), and one region (nucleotides −122 to −62) was responsible for non-cell-specific basal promoter activity in both THP-1 and K562 cells (Fig. 2, B and C). Deletion, mutation, and gel shift analyses established that the transcriptional activity of the basal promoter region depended on an Sp1 site (GC box at nucleotides −120 to −115) and an Inr-like motif (nucleotides −66 to −62) which encompasses the most proximal transcription start site at previously identified nucleotide −66 (10.Penrose J.F. Spector J. Baldasaro M. Xu K. Boyce J. Arm J.P. Austen K.F. Lam B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11356-11361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The factors bound to the GC box were identified as the Kruppel transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3 by supershift analysis (Fig. 3 B). The protein that bound to the Inr-like motif was not identified even though the formation of the DNA-protein complex was inhibited by an oligonucleotide containing the classic TdT Inr (Fig. 3 A). The fact that the mutation of either the GC box or the Inr of the LTC4S promoter reduced reporter activity by more than 50% in THP-1 cells (Fig. 3 C) suggests that both of these elements are functionally important and are required for transcription initiation and for full promoter activity.Linker-scanning mutagenesis of the region immediately upstream of the basal promoter revealed a 40-bp region between nucleotides −164 and −125 (Fig. 4 B) important for cell-specific transcription of the reporter gene. This region contains an AP3 binding site and a tandem repeat of a CACCC site (nucleotides −149 to −145 and −139 to −135). The proximal CACCC site overlaps a CCCTC site, and the distal CACCC is encompassed by a CACACCC site (Fig. 4 A). EMSA with an oligonucleotide containing the AP3 site (Table I) yielded a DNA-protein complex with a THP-1 cell nuclear extract (data not shown), but the nature of the binding protein was not pursued because the putative AP3 factor has not been cloned. The nuclear extract of THP-1 cells formed two complexes (a′ and b′) (Fig.5 A) with the proximal CACCC/CCCTC motif oligonucleotide (Table I). However, only the mutation of the CCCTC motif (mutant A) abolished the ability to compete with the native oligonucleotide. Therefore, it is likely that the CCCTC motif is involved in binding to the transcription factors in the formation of complexes a′ and b′.EMSA with the distal CACCC-containing oligonucleotide and THP-1 cell nuclear extract resulted in the formation of three DNA-protein complexes, complex a and two upper complexes identified as Sp3 and Sp1-Sp3 by supershift analyses (Fig. 6 B). Therefore, the transcription factors of the Sp1 family bind to both the CACCC motif (an inverted GT box) (25.Sabath D.E. Koehler K.M. Yang W.Q. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4978-4986Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) and the GC box. The transcription factor involved in complex a is not known; however, EKLF, a Kruppel-like protein, gel shifted the distal CACCC site, suggesting that a member of that family is involved in complex aformation.The involvement of a Kruppel-like factor and Sp1, through binding to the distal CACCC site, in cell-specific transcription of LTC4S was supported further by cotransfection experiments. Sp1 transactivated the −228 construct in transfected SL2 cells (Fig.6 C). EKLF itself did not transactivate the −228 construct in K562 cells (data not shown); however, another Kruppel-like protein, Zf9/CPBP (17.Ratziu V. Lalazar A. Wong L. Dang Q. Collins C. Shaulian E. Jensen S. Friedman S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9500-9505Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), was able to transactivate the −228 construct in transfected COS cells (Fig. 6 D). Mutations of the proximal site or overlapping both the proximal and the distal CACCC sites substantially reduced the ability of both Sp1 and Zf9/CPBP to transactivate the reporter constructs (Fig. 6, C andD). Together with the data from transfection with linker-scanning mutants in THP-1 cells (Fig. 4 B), these results indicate that the distal CACCC site is important for the cell-specific transcription of the reporter gene. Although mutation of the proximal CACCC site decreased the reporter activity, the involvement of the proximal CACCC site in the transcription regulation of the LTC4S gene is not conclusive because gel shift data showed the binding of transcription factors to the CCCTC motif (complexes a′ and b′) and not the proximal CACCC motif (Fig. 5 A).Zf9 binds to a GC box and transactivates collagen α1(I) (17.Ratziu V.

Zf9 binds avidly to a tandem repeat of the GC box in the transforming growth factor β1 promoter but minimally to a single copy of its cognate recognition site (26.Kim Y. Ratziu V. Choi S.G.

CPBP, the human homolog of Zf9, binds to a CACCC motif and transactivates the TATA-less promoter of pregnancy-specific glycoprotein in COS cells (27.Koritschoner N.P. Bocco J.L. Panzetta-Dutari G.M.

The transactivation of the LTC4S promoter/reporter construct (Fig.6 D) was comparable to the collagen α1(I) and the pregnancy-specific glycoprotein promoters by Zf9/CPBP in rat hepatic stellate and COS cells (17.Ratziu V.

These results suggest that a Kruppel-like factor, such as Zf9/CPBP, is involved in the regulation of the cell-specific transcription of LTC4S. The Kruppel-like factor may work in concert with coactivator partner(s) in THP-1 cells, such as the proteins that bound to the proximal CACCC/CCCTC sequence, as in complex a′ and b′ (Fig. 5 B). Furthermore, interaction between Zf9/CPBP and Sp1 proteins has recently been reported (26.Kim Y. Ratziu V. Choi S.G. Lalazar A. Theiss G. Dang Q. Kim S.J. Friedman S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33750-33758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), suggesting that Zf9/CPBP may interact with Sp1 bound to the proximal GC box to transactivate the LTC4S promoter.Like LTC4S, LTA4 hydrolase and 5-lipoxygenase are also TATA-less genes (28.Hoshiko S. Radmark O. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9073-9077Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 29.Mancini J.A. Evans J.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Deletional and mutational analyses of the 5-lipoxygenase promoter in a reporter construct revealed a GC-rich region that is important for transcription (28.Hoshiko S. Radmark O. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9073-9077Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Gel shift assay demonstrated that a 5 tandem repeat sequence in the GC-rich region bound to transcription factors Sp1 and Egr-1 (30.In K.H. Asano K. Beier D. Grobholz J. Finn P.W. Silverman E.K. Silverman E.S. Collins T. Fischer A.R. Keith T.P. Serino K. Kim S.W. De Sanctis G.T. Yandava C. Pillari A. Rubin P. Kemp J. Israel E. Busse W. Ledford D. Murray J.J. Segal A. Tinkleman D. Drazen J.M.

Radmark O. Samuelsson B. Drazen J.M. Collins T. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 19: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Naturally occurring mutations in this repeat region have also been identified in the human 5-lipoxygenase gene, raising the possibility of clinical implications in asthma (30.In K.H. Asano K. Beier D. Grobholz J. Finn P.W. Silverman E.K. Silverman E.S. Collins T. Fischer A.R. Keith T.P. Serino K. Kim S.W. De Sanctis G.T. Yandava C. Pillari A. Rubin P. Kemp J. Israel E. Busse W. Ledford D. Murray J.J. Segal A. Tinkleman D. Drazen J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1130-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). In our cotransfection experiment in SL2 cells, Egr-1 did not transactivate the LTC4S reporter gene (data not shown), whereas Sp1 did (Fig. 6 C).Although there is another enhancing region upstream of the 228-bp proximal core promoter, the more proximal enhancer elements do functionally interact with the basal promoter to provide transcription in THP-1 cells and transactivation with cotransfection. Thus the 228-bp proximal core promoter contains both the basal and the cell-specificcis-acting elements for a TATA-less human gene whose encoded protein is narrowly distributed and is solely responsible for LTC4 generation in cells central to allergic and asthmatic pathobiology. LTC4 synthase (LTC4S)1catalyzes the conjugation of leukotriene A4 and glutathione (GSH) to form LTC4. LTC4 is implicated in the pathobiology of bronchial asthma by the efficacy of inhibitors of its biosynthesis and of receptor blockers for its constrictor metabolites in the treatment of this condition. LTC4S is an 18-kDa perinuclear membrane protein that functions as a dimer (1.Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Vaillancourt J.P. Calaycay J.R. Mumford R.A. Zamboni R.J. Ford-Hutchinson A.W. Proc. Natl. Acad.

LTC4S was the first catalytic protein identified in a newly recognized superfamily of membrane-associated proteins involved in eicosanoid and GSH metabolism (MAPEG) (6.Jakobsson P.J. Morgenstern R. Mancini J. Ford-Hutchinson A. Persson B. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The MAPEG family members include the following: 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein, which is required for 5-lipoxygenase to metabolize released arachidonic acid to LTA4; microsomal GSH S-transferase II and III, enzymes that are important in cellular protection mechanisms such as detoxification of xenobiotics and the peroxidation of lipid hydroperoxides (7.Jakobsson P.J. Mancini J.A. Ford-Hutchinson A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22203-22210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and also can conjugate LTA4 to GSH; and GSH-dependent prostaglandin E synthase, a terminal enzyme of the cyclooxygenase pathway (8.Polyak K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1997; 389: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2225) Google Scholar, 9.Jakobsson P.J. Thoren S. Morgenstern R. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7220-7225Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar) that provides prostaglandin E2, a key prostanoid inflammatory mediator. Thus, the MAPEG is the only superfamily with members that are critical to both the lipoxygenase pathway and the cyclooxygenase pathway of the arachidonic acid cascade. LTC4S is solely committed to the conjugation of LTA4 to GSH and does not utilize xenobiotics as an alternative substrate. Site-directed mutational analysis of the catalytic mechanism for LTC4S suggested that Arg-51 is involved in the opening of the epoxide ring of the LTA4 and that Tyr-93 is responsible for GSH thiolate anion formation with resultant conjugation of the epoxide ring with the thiolate anion to yield LTC4 (2.Lam B.K. Penrose J.F. Xu K. Baldasaro M.H. Austen K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13923-13928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Arg-51 of LTC4S is conserved in other members of the MAPEG family with catalytic function. Only Tyr-93 is conserved in 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein, which has no known enzymatic function. The human LTC4S gene is mapped to the 5q35 region of human chromosome 5 (10.Penrose J.F. Spector J. Baldasaro M. Xu K. Boyce J. Arm J.P. Austen K.F. Lam B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11356-11361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) in close proximity to the cluster of cytokine genes implicated in the polarization and function of the T cell of the Th2 phenotype in allergic and asthmatic disease. De novo induced LTC4S transcript, protein, and function have been documented during differentiation and maturation of human eosinophils from cord blood progenitors with interleukin (IL)-3 and IL-5 in the presence of Matrigel over 2–4 weeks (11.Boyce J.A. Lam B.K. Penrose J.P. Friend D.S. Parson S. Owen W.F. Austen K.F. Blood. 1996; 88: 4338-4347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, mouse bone marrow-derived immature mast cells obtained with stem cell factor and IL-10 respond to stimulation with IL-3 in the presence of stem cell factor and IL-10 with marked up-regulation of LTC4S transcript, protein, and function over a 2-week period (12.Murakami M.

Although full regulation of LTC4S expression requires consideration of gene transcription, post-transcriptional mRNA stability (13.Riddick C.A. Serio K.J. Hodulik C.R. Ring W.L. Regan M.S. Bigby T.D. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1101-1107PubMed Google Scholar), and post-translational protein phosphorylation (14.Ali A. Ford-Hutchinson A.W. Nicholson D.W. J.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), the developmental expression of LTC4S in in vitrostudies of the human eosinophil and the mouse mast cell prompts an initial focus on transcriptional regulation of this selectively expressed gene. We now report the identification of multiple cis-acting elements in the LTC4S promoter, including a proximal initiator-like element CAGAC (nucleotides −66 to −62) functioning in concert with an Sp1 site (nucleotides −120 to −115) to provide basal transcription and an upstream cell-specific cis-acting element CACCC (nucleotides −149 to −145) transactivated by Zf9/core promoter-binding protein (CPBP), a Kruppel-like factor, and Sp1. Within the context of the MAPEG superfamily of genes involved in the metabolism of released arachidonic acid, this is the first report of enhancing transacting factors functioning in concert with a TATA-less basal initiator complex to regulate expression in transfected cells. DISCUSSIONThe regulatory cis-acting elements and candidate transcription factors for the proximal core promoter involved in the transcription of the human LTC4S gene in THP-1 cells are described in the present study and depicted schematically in Fig.7. The core promoter of the LTC4S gene is located within 228 bp upstream of the translation start site and is composed of a non-cell-specific basal promoter region and a cell-specific upstream enhancer region. The basal promoter region contains an Inr-binding motif of CAGAC and an Sp1 binding GC box, whereas the enhancer region contains a tandem CACCC site that binds Sp1 and a Kruppel-like transcription factor.Deletional analysis of 2.1 kb of the 5′-flanking sequence of the human LTC4S gene revealed that two regions (nucleotides −557 to −228 and −175 to −122) were responsible for cell-specific promoter activity in THP-1 cells (Fig. 2, A and C), and one region (nucleotides −122 to −62) was responsible for non-cell-specific basal promoter activity in both THP-1 and K562 cells (Fig. 2, B and C). Deletion, mutation, and gel shift analyses established that the transcriptional activity of the basal promoter region depended on an Sp1 site (GC box at nucleotides −120 to −115) and an Inr-like motif (nucleotides −66 to −62) which encompasses the most proximal transcription start site at previously identified nucleotide −66 (10.Penrose J.F. Spector J. Baldasaro M. Xu K. Boyce J. Arm J.P. Austen K.F. Lam B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11356-11361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The factors bound to the GC box were identified as the Kruppel transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3 by supershift analysis (Fig. 3 B). The protein that bound to the Inr-like motif was not identified even though the formation of the DNA-protein complex was inhibited by an oligonucleotide containing the classic TdT Inr (Fig. 3 A). The fact that the mutation of either the GC box or the Inr of the LTC4S promoter reduced reporter activity by more than 50% in THP-1 cells (Fig. 3 C) suggests that both of these elements are functionally important and are required for transcription initiation and for full promoter activity.Linker-scanning mutagenesis of the region immediately upstream of the basal promoter revealed a 40-bp region between nucleotides −164 and −125 (Fig. 4 B) important for cell-specific transcription of the reporter gene. This region contains an AP3 binding site and a tandem repeat of a CACCC site (nucleotides −149 to −145 and −139 to −135). The proximal CACCC site overlaps a CCCTC site, and the distal CACCC is encompassed by a CACACCC site (Fig. 4 A). EMSA with an oligonucleotide containing the AP3 site (Table I) yielded a DNA-protein complex with a THP-1 cell nuclear extract (data not shown), but the nature of the binding protein was not pursued because the putative AP3 factor has not been cloned. The nuclear extract of THP-1 cells formed two complexes (a′ and b′) (Fig.5 A) with the proximal CACCC/CCCTC motif oligonucleotide (Table I). However, only the mutation of the CCCTC motif (mutant A) abolished the ability to compete with the native oligonucleotide. Therefore, it is likely that the CCCTC motif is involved in binding to the transcription factors in the formation of complexes a′ and b′.EMSA with the distal CACCC-containing oligonucleotide and THP-1 cell nuclear extract resulted in the formation of three DNA-protein complexes, complex a and two upper complexes identified as Sp3 and Sp1-Sp3 by supershift analyses (Fig. 6 B). Therefore, the transcription factors of the Sp1 family bind to both the CACCC motif (an inverted GT box) (25.Sabath D.E. Koehler K.M. Yang W.Q. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4978-4986Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) and the GC box. The transcription factor involved in complex a is not known; however, EKLF, a Kruppel-like protein, gel shifted the distal CACCC site, suggesting that a member of that family is involved in complex aformation.The involvement of a Kruppel-like factor and Sp1, through binding to the distal CACCC site, in cell-specific transcription of LTC4S was supported further by cotransfection experiments. Sp1 transactivated the −228 construct in transfected SL2 cells (Fig.6 C). EKLF itself did not transactivate the −228 construct in K562 cells (data not shown); however, another Kruppel-like protein, Zf9/CPBP (17.Ratziu V. Lalazar A. Wong L. Dang Q. Collins C. Shaulian E.

A. 1998; 95: 9500-9505Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), was able to transactivate the −228 construct in transfected COS cells (Fig. 6 D). Mutations of the proximal site or overlapping both the proximal and the distal CACCC sites substantially reduced the ability of both Sp1 and Zf9/CPBP to transactivate the reporter constructs (Fig. 6, C andD). Together with the data from transfection with linker-scanning mutants in THP-1 cells (Fig. 4 B), these results indicate that the distal CACCC site is important for the cell-specific transcription of the reporter gene. Although mutation of the proximal CACCC site decreased the reporter activity, the involvement of the proximal CACCC site in the transcription regulation of the LTC4S gene is not conclusive because gel shift data showed the binding of transcription factors to the CCCTC motif (complexes a′ and b′) and not the proximal CACCC motif (Fig. 5 A).Zf9 binds to a GC box and transactivates collagen α1(I) (17.Ratziu V.

These results suggest that a Kruppel-like factor, such as Zf9/CPBP, is involved in the regulation of the cell-specific transcription of LTC4S. The Kruppel-like factor may work in concert with coactivator partner(s) in THP-1 cells, such as the proteins that bound to the proximal CACCC/CCCTC sequence, as in complex a′ and b′ (Fig. 5 B). Furthermore, interaction between Zf9/CPBP and Sp1 proteins has recently been reported (26.Kim Y. Ratziu V. Choi S.G. Lalazar A. Theiss G. Dang Q. Kim S.J. Friedman S.L. J. Biol.

Deletional and mutational analyses of the 5-lipoxygenase promoter in a reporter construct revealed a GC-rich region that is important for transcription (28.Hoshiko S. Radmark O. Samuelsson B. Proc.

Gel shift assay demonstrated that a 5 tandem repeat sequence in the GC-rich region bound to transcription factors Sp1 and Egr-1 (30.In K.H. Asano K. Beier D. Grobholz J. Finn P.W. Silverman E.K.

Naturally occurring mutations in this repeat region have also been identified in the human 5-lipoxygenase gene, raising the possibility of clinical implications in asthma (30.In K.H. Asano K.

In our cotransfection experiment in SL2 cells, Egr-1 did not transactivate the LTC4S reporter gene (data not shown), whereas Sp1 did (Fig. 6 C).Although there is another enhancing region upstream of the 228-bp proximal core promoter, the more proximal enhancer elements do functionally interact with the basal promoter to provide transcription in THP-1 cells and transactivation with cotransfection. Thus the 228-bp proximal core promoter contains both the basal and the cell-specificcis-acting elements for a TATA-less human gene whose encoded protein is narrowly distributed and is solely responsible for LTC4 generation in cells central to allergic and asthmatic pathobiology. The regulatory cis-acting elements and candidate transcription factors for the proximal core promoter involved in the transcription of the human LTC4S gene in THP-1 cells are described in the present study and depicted schematically in Fig.7. The core promoter of the LTC4S gene is located within 228 bp upstream of the translation start site and is composed of a non-cell-specific basal promoter region and a cell-specific upstream enhancer region. The basal promoter region contains an Inr-binding motif of CAGAC and an Sp1 binding GC box, whereas the enhancer region contains a tandem CACCC site that binds Sp1 and a Kruppel-like transcription factor. Deletional analysis of 2.1 kb of the 5′-flanking sequence of the human LTC4S gene revealed that two regions (nucleotides −557 to −228 and −175 to −122) were responsible for cell-specific promoter activity in THP-1 cells (Fig. 2, A and C), and one region (nucleotides −122 to −62) was responsible for non-cell-specific basal promoter activity in both THP-1 and K562 cells (Fig. 2, B and C). Deletion, mutation, and gel shift analyses established that the transcriptional activity of the basal promoter region depended on an Sp1 site (GC box at nucleotides −120 to −115) and an Inr-like motif (nucleotides −66 to −62) which encompasses the most proximal transcription start site at previously identified nucleotide −66 (10.Penrose J.F. Spector J. Baldasaro M. Xu K. Boyce J. Arm J.P. Austen K.F. Lam B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11356-11361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The factors bound to the GC box were identified as the Kruppel transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3 by supershift analysis (Fig. 3 B). The protein that bound to the Inr-like motif was not identified even though the formation of the DNA-protein complex was inhibited by an oligonucleotide containing the classic TdT Inr (Fig. 3 A). The fact that the mutation of either the GC box or the Inr of the LTC4S promoter reduced reporter activity by more than 50% in THP-1 cells (Fig. 3 C) suggests that both of these elements are functionally important and are required for transcription initiation and for full promoter activity. Linker-scanning mutagenesis of the region immediately upstream of the basal promoter revealed a 40-bp region between nucleotides −164 and −125 (Fig. 4 B) important for cell-specific transcription of the reporter gene. This region contains an AP3 binding site and a tandem repeat of a CACCC site (nucleotides −149 to −145 and −139 to −135). The proximal CACCC site overlaps a CCCTC site, and the distal CACCC is encompassed by a CACACCC site (Fig. 4 A). EMSA with an oligonucleotide containing the AP3 site (Table I) yielded a DNA-protein complex with a THP-1 cell nuclear extract (data not shown), but the nature of the binding protein was not pursued because the putative AP3 factor has not been cloned. The nuclear extract of THP-1 cells formed two complexes (a′ and b′) (Fig.5 A) with the proximal CACCC/CCCTC motif oligonucleotide (Table I). However, only the mutation of the CCCTC motif (mutant A) abolished the ability to compete with the native oligonucleotide. Therefore, it is likely that the CCCTC motif is involved in binding to the transcription factors in the formation of complexes a′ and b′. EMSA with the distal CACCC-containing oligonucleotide and THP-1 cell nuclear extract resulted in the formation of three DNA-protein complexes, complex a and two upper complexes identified as Sp3 and Sp1-Sp3 by supershift analyses (Fig. 6 B). Therefore, the transcription factors of the Sp1 family bind to both the CACCC motif (an inverted GT box) (25.Sabath D.E. Koehler K.M. Yang W.Q. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4978-4986Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) and the GC box. The transcription factor involved in complex a is not known; however, EKLF, a Kruppel-like protein, gel shifted the distal CACCC site, suggesting that a member of that family is involved in complex aformation. The involvement of a Kruppel-like factor and Sp1, through binding to the distal CACCC site, in cell-specific transcription of LTC4S was supported further by cotransfection experiments. Sp1 transactivated the −228 construct in transfected SL2 cells (Fig.6 C). EKLF itself did not transactivate the −228 construct in K562 cells (data not shown); however, another Kruppel-like protein, Zf9/CPBP (17.Ratziu V. Lalazar A. Wong L. Dang Q. Collins C. Shaulian E. Jensen S. Friedman S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9500-9505Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), was able to transactivate the −228 construct in transfected COS cells (Fig. 6 D). Mutations of the proximal site or overlapping both the proximal and the distal CACCC sites substantially reduced the ability of both Sp1 and Zf9/CPBP to transactivate the reporter constructs (Fig. 6, C andD). Together with the data from transfection with linker-scanning mutants in THP-1 cells (Fig. 4 B), these results indicate that the distal CACCC site is important for the cell-specific transcription of the reporter gene. Although mutation of the proximal CACCC site decreased the reporter activity, the involvement of the proximal CACCC site in the transcription regulation of the LTC4S gene is not conclusive because gel shift data showed the binding of transcription factors to the CCCTC motif (complexes a′ and b′) and not the proximal CACCC motif (Fig. 5 A). Zf9 binds to a GC box and transactivates collagen α1(I) (17.Ratziu V. Lalazar A. Wong L. Dang Q. Collins C. Shaulian E. Jensen S. Friedman S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9500-9505Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) and transforming growth factor β1 promoters (26.Kim Y. Ratziu V. Choi S.G. Lalazar A. Theiss G. Dang Q. Kim S.J. Friedman S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33750-33758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Zf9 binds avidly to a tandem repeat of the GC box in the transforming growth factor β1 promoter but minimally to a single copy of its cognate recognition site (26.Kim Y. Ratziu V. Choi S.G.

CPBP, the human homolog of Zf9, binds to a CACCC motif and transactivates the TATA-less promoter of pregnancy-specific glycoprotein in COS cells (27.Koritschoner N.P. Bocco J.L. Panzetta-Dutari G.M. Dumur C.I. Flury A. Patrito L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9573-9580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The transactivation of the LTC4S promoter/reporter construct (Fig.6 D) was comparable to the collagen α1(I) and the pregnancy-specific glycoprotein promoters by Zf9/CPBP in rat hepatic stellate and COS cells (17.Ratziu V.

These results suggest that a Kruppel-like factor, such as Zf9/CPBP, is involved in the regulation of the cell-specific transcription of LTC4S. The Kruppel-like factor may work in concert with coactivator partner(s) in THP-1 cells, such as the proteins that bound to the proximal CACCC/CCCTC sequence, as in complex a′ and b′ (Fig. 5 B). Furthermore, interaction between Zf9/CPBP and Sp1 proteins has recently been reported (26.Kim Y. Ratziu V. Choi S.G. Lalazar A. Theiss G. Dang Q. Kim S.J. Friedman S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33750-33758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), suggesting that Zf9/CPBP may interact with Sp1 bound to the proximal GC box to transactivate the LTC4S promoter. Like LTC4S, LTA4 hydrolase and 5-lipoxygenase are also TATA-less genes (28.Hoshiko S. Radmark O. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9073-9077Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 29.Mancini J.A. Evans J.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Deletional and mutational analyses of the 5-lipoxygenase promoter in a reporter construct revealed a GC-rich region that is important for transcription (28.Hoshiko S. Radmark O. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9073-9077Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Gel shift assay demonstrated that a 5 tandem repeat sequence in the GC-rich region bound to transcription factors Sp1 and Egr-1 (30.In K.H. Asano K. Beier D. Grobholz J. Finn P.W. Silverman E.K. Silverman E.S. Collins T. Fischer A.R. Keith T.P. Serino K. Kim S.W. De Sanctis G.T. Yandava C. Pillari A. Rubin P. Kemp J. Israel E. Busse W. Ledford D. Murray J.J. Segal A. Tinkleman D. Drazen J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1130-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), both of which transactivate the 5-lipoxygenase promoter in SL2 cells (31.Silverman E.S. Du J. De Sanctis G.T. Radmark O. Samuelsson B. Drazen J.M. Collins T. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 19: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Naturally occurring mutations in this repeat region have also been identified in the human 5-lipoxygenase gene, raising the possibility of clinical implications in asthma (30.In K.H. Asano K. Beier D. Grobholz J. Finn P.W. Silverman E.K. Silverman E.S. Collins T. Fischer A.R. Keith T.P. Serino K. Kim S.W. De Sanctis G.T. Yandava C. Pillari A. Rubin P. Kemp J. Israel E. Busse W. Ledford D.

In our cotransfection experiment in SL2 cells, Egr-1 did not transactivate the LTC4S reporter gene (data not shown), whereas Sp1 did (Fig. 6 C). Although there is another enhancing region upstream of the 228-bp proximal core promoter, the more proximal enhancer elements do functionally interact with the basal promoter to provide transcription in THP-1 cells and transactivation with cotransfection. Thus the 228-bp proximal core promoter contains both the basal and the cell-specificcis-acting elements for a TATA-less human gene whose encoded protein is narrowly distributed and is solely responsible for LTC4 generation in cells central to allergic and asthmatic pathobiology.

The corresponding gene coded for a 45-kDa protein potentially including a signal peptide, a membrane-spanning domain and an N-terminal domain containing 8N-glycosylation sites. There was no significant sequence homology with other phosphatases. Antiserum to the Escherichia coli recombinant N-terminal domain, Petase7, recognized a protein of 55 kDa in Western blots after deglycosylation of the TryAcP115 protein by N-glycosidase F. Immunofluorescence and trypsin treatment of living parasites showed that TryAcP115 was localized to the surface of the parasite and that its N-terminal domain was oriented extracellularly. The recombinant N-terminal domains, expressed inE. coli and Leishmania amazonensis, harbored phosphatase activity against Tyr(P)-Raytide, Ser(P)-neurogranin, and ATP. The enzymatic properties of native TryAcP115 and the recombinant proteins for the substrate Tyr(P)-Raytide were virtually identical and included: (i) K m and V maxvalues of 15 nm and 200 pmol/min/mg, (ii) no requirement for divalent cations, and (iii) sensitivity to vanadate, sodium fluoride, and tartrate, but insensitivity to okadaic acid and tetramisole. Although the function of TryAcP115 remains unknown, a differentially expressed, unique ecto-phosphatase could regulate growth or influence parasite-host interactions and might provide a useful target for chemotherapy.

Extracellular ATP levels are under the control of ecto-ATPases and ecto-apyrases, which can be distinguished by the substrates they hydrolyze, NTPs1 and both NTPs and NDPs, respectively (3.Smith T.M.

T. brucei is a digenetic parasitic protozoan with a complex life cycle characterized by proliferative and non-proliferative stages, accompanied by biochemical and morphological changes depending on the insect and the mammalian host (19.Matthews K. Gull K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1147-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It also alternates between infectious and noninfectious stages, but the mechanisms that regulate these alternating periods of growth and infectivity are unknown. Immunosuppression, including a depressed T-cell response (20.Mabbott N. Sternberg J. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 1563-1566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is considered to be an essential element of the host-parasite relationships in the early stages of infection (21.Taylor K. Lutje V. Mertens B. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 4115-4122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previously we characterized differentially expressed, plasma membrane-associated tyrosine phosphatase activity in T. brucei (22.Bakalara N. Seyfang A. Baltz T. Davis C. Exp.

By monitoring tyrosine phosphatase activity, we have now purified and cloned a membrane protein phosphatase without significant sequence homology with other phosphatases. Kinetic values, substrate specificity, and modulator profiles were similar to those of acidic protein phosphatases. These characteristics and the extracellular localization of the catalytic domain suggest that this protein belongs to a new family of acidic ecto-phosphatases.

Briefly, F2 represented a ghost fraction obtained by hypotonic lysis, F3 was the F2 fraction stripped of peripheral and cytoskeletal proteins by EDTA/alkali treatment, and F4 was the octylthioglucoside-solubilized protein fraction. F4TS consisted of Triton X-100-solubilized proteins obtained by treating F3 for 30 min at 4 °C with gentle agitation with 0.5% Triton X-100 and centrifugation for 1 h at 100,000 × g. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (29.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216204) Google Scholar), 0.1% Triton X-100 was used to solubilize the proteins when necessary. Bovine serum albumin was used as a standard. DEAE-Sepharose fast flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Saclay, France), was used for ion exchange chromatography. O-Phospho-l-Tyrosine (O-Tyr(P)) immobilized on cross-linked 4% beaded agarose from Sigma was used for affinity chromatography. The chromatographic system used throughout this study was the FPLC workstation from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All buffers contained a protease inhibitor mixture with final concentrations of 1 μm chemostatin, 1 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, and 10 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The F3 fraction was equilibrated in buffer A1 (40 mm MES, pH 5.6, 0.5% Triton X-100, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mmEDTA, protease inhibitor mixture) and loaded on the DEAE fast flow column from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech pre-equilibrated in buffer A1. The column was then washed with buffer A1 and the breakthrough collected. Elution was performed by the discontinuous step gradient method. Fractions were collected at 70 and 100% buffer B1 (40 mm MES, pH 5.6, 0.5% Triton X-100, 200 mmNaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, protease inhibitor mixture). Proteins were eluted at each step and the major phosphotyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) activity was identified at the 70% buffer B1 step. Flow rate was 2 ml/min for each step. The 70% eluted DEAE fraction was diluted and equilibrated with pre-equilibration buffer A2 (50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4, 0.5% Triton X-100, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, protease inhibitor mixture and adsorbed onto a buffer A2 pre-equilibrated O-Tyr(P)-agarose affinity column. The column was washed with buffer A2 and the breakthrough collected. The enzyme was eluted with a linear salt gradient from 20 to 500 mm NaCl in buffer B2 (50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4, 0.5% Triton X-100, 600 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mmEDTA, protease inhibitor mixture) in a total volume of 20 ml. A major protein peak with PTPase activity was eluted at 150 mmsalt. Flow rate was 1 ml/min for each step. Petase7, the recombinant protein expressed in Escherichia coli was purified over the same column and conditions with the following buffer compositions: buffer A3 (50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4, 20 mmNaCl, 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol, protease inhibitors); buffer B3 (50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4, 500 mmNaCl, 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol protease inhibitor mixture). Before loading, the dialyzed His·BindTM eluted fraction was equilibrated in buffer A3. The His·BindTM column from Novagen was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Before loading, the Leishmaniaculture medium was equilibrated in 1× binding buffer. The eluted fractions were dialyzed overnight against 2 liters of 30 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.2, 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Concentration of pTEX/AcP protein was estimated by Western blot using Petase7 as a control. Raytide (10 μg, Oncogene Science) was phosphorylated with epidermal growth factor receptor kinase (Stratagene) for 4 h at 30 °C in 50 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm MnCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm ATP, and 50 mm [γ-32P]ATP (44,000 cpm/pmol). 10 μg of Kemptide (Sigma) was phosphorylated with pKA (Sigma) and [γ-32P]ATP (44 000 cpm/pmol); the [γ-32P]ATP was removed as described previously (22.Bakalara N. Seyfang A. Baltz T. Davis C. Exp. Parasitol. 1995; 81: 302-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Neurogranin was phosphorylated with pKC (Promega) and [γ-32P]ATP (8800 cpm/pmol); [γ-32P]ATP was removed by ion exchange chromatography on DEAE fast flow with 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.8, buffer. Determination of PTPase activity, optimum pH, the inhibitor profile, and reconstitution assays were conducted as described previously (30.Bakalara N. Seyfang A. Davis C. Baltz T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). All activity assays were carried out for 1 h at 30 °C in 50 mm acetate buffer, pH 4, with 100 nm Tyr(P)-Raytide or 50 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP). ATPase activity was followed by measuring the release of phosphate according to Mitsui et al. (31.Mitsui H. Nakatani K. Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Shinozaki K. Nishikawa K. Takahashi H. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 865-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) at pH 6.9 using 1 mm[γ-32P]ATP (55,000 cpm/nmol). Before the assay, protein extract buffer was exchanged by PEM buffer (0.1 m Pipes, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, pH 6.9) using a PD10 column from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Gel slices for sequencing were obtained from Amido Black-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels and sent for microsequencing to the “Laboratoire de Microsequençage des Proteines” Dr. Dalayer, Institut Pasteur Paris (32.Rosenfeld J. Capdevielle J. Guillemot J.C. Ferrara P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). Total cell RNA and poly(A)+ RNA were prepared and purified according to Sambrook et al. (33.Sambrook J. Fritsh E. Maniatis T. Ford N. Nolan C. Ferguson M. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar). cDNA was obtained by random priming with hexanucleotides and reverse transcription with the Stratagene reverse transcriptase RT II. The P1CaAS (5′-ATNACYTGRCTNCCRAARTA-3′), P3CaAS (5′-TTRCTYTCCCAYTCRTC-3′), and P1CaS (5′-TAYTTYGGNAGYCARGTNAT-3′) degenerate oligonucleotides were generated by the reverse translation of sequenced peptides, P1 (YFGSQVI) and P3 (DEWESK) and translation of P1 (YFGSQVI), respectively. A portion of the common splice leader sequence ofT. brucei mRNAs (5′-ACAGTTTCTGTACTATATTG-3′) was also used as a 5′ primer (MEX2). The cDNA was then used as a template for PCR amplification using the primer associations MEX2/P3CaAS, MEX2/P1CaAS, and P1CaS/P3CaAS. A “touch-down” PCR from 60 to 50 °C was performed with a “hot start.” The amplified fragments were gel-isolated, cloned into the pT7blue T-vector (Novagen) and sequenced. The amplified and cloned MEX2/P3CaAS fragment was used as a probe to screen a T. brucei genomic DNA library (33.Sambrook J. Fritsh E. Maniatis T. Ford N. Nolan C. Ferguson M. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar) generated into the c2X75 cosmid vector (34.Campbell D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 458Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) as described previously (35.Bates P. Swift R. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 26: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).KpnI fragments of the isolated I.3 cosmid were subcloned in the pUC18 vector from Appligene and screened with the cDNA fragment MEX2/P3CaAS. A KpnI fragment of 5000 base pairs was isolated and sequenced using the AmpliTaq DNA polymerase, as described by the manufacturer (ABI PRISMTM, Perkin Elmer). A rabbit was injected with 150 μg of Petase7 in complete Freund's adjuvant and with 100 μg in incomplete 15 and 30 days later. Blood was collected before the first injection (preimmune serum) and 10, 13, and 15 days following the last injection. Affinity purified proteins in sample buffer (2.2% SDS, 50 mm DTT, 90 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and 10% glycerol, mass/volume) were boiled for 5 min and subjected to 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Immobilon P, Millipore) membranes by semi-dry blotting (36.Kyshe-Andersen J. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1984; 10: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (2158) Google Scholar). Filters were blocked for 15 min with PBS/Tween/milk (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mmNa2HPO4, 1.4 mmKH2PO4, 0,005% Tween 20, 5% milk), incubated overnight at 4 °C with a 1/500 dilution of serum against Petase7 in PBS/Tween/milk and incubated for 2 h with either 1/1000 goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sanofi-Pasteur) in PBS/Tween/milk or 1/2000 goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Bio-Rad) in TBS/Tween/milk. Immunoreactive bands were revealed by washing in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm NaCl and a solution containing 0.05% H2O2 and 2.8 mm 4-chloro-1-naphtol for the peroxidase conjugate, and according to Sambrook et al. (33.Sambrook J. Fritsh E. Maniatis T. Ford N. Nolan C. Ferguson M. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar) for the alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Pasteur Sanofi). Bloodstream form trypanosomes (AnTat) were obtained at peak parasitemia from infected mice, and fixed on ice for 2 min in 0.2% formaldehyde. The formaldehyde was neutralized for 10 min with 0.1 m glycine at room temperature. After centrifugation and resuspension in PBS, trypanosomes were transferred to a microscope slide and treated with anti-Petase7 diluted (1/500) in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at room temperature followed by the fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibody (Pasteur Sanofi) diluted (1/1000) in PBS, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.001% Evans blue for an additional 30 min. After washing, slides containing the treated trypanosomes were mounted with anti-fade Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). For Leishmania, 106 promastigotes were transferred to circular glass poly-l-lysine-treated (30 min. in 10 μg/ml) coverslips and placed inside a 24-well plate. After centrifugation at 130 × g for 10 min, cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 1 h and washed twice with PBS before incubation for 1 h at room temperature with anti- Petase7 serum, diluted 1000-fold in PBS containing 10% mouse serum. After three washes of 10 min each in PBS, fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG diluted 2000-fold in PBS with 10% goat serum was added as a secondary antibody. Photomicrographs were taken through a Zeiss UV microscope and images analyzed by the use of a camera (Photometrics) with Iplab software (Sigma Analytics) and Adobe photoshop 4.0 on a Macintosh 7100/80 computer. A 1-kilobase fragment comprising the N-terminal region lacking the putative signal peptide was generated by PCR. A 5-kilobase KpnI genomic fragment from AnTat 1 subcloned in pBlueScript (Stratagene) was used as a template in the PCR reaction. The 5′ primer (5′-GGCAAACATATGGAGTCGAGCAGCGATGCGCAA-3′) contained a 12-nucleotide linker with a NdeI restriction site to facilitate subcloning and 7 adjacent N-terminal residues (ESSSDAQ). The 3′ primer, (5′-AACAAGGGATCCTTACTGATGCTGATGCTGATGCTCGGGTATCGTTAACGG-3′), included a 12-nucleotide linker with a BamHI site for cloning, a stop codon, codons for 6-histidine tag residues to allow binding to the His·BindTM column, and codons for 6 C-terminal residues (PLTIPE). The PCR product was inserted into aNdeI/BamHI sites of the pET3a plasmid (Novagen) to create the Petase7 construction. The mutated recombinant gene coding for the mutated protein PetaseM4 was obtained by using the site-directed mutagenesis kit from CLONTECH, Petase7 as DNA matrix and the following mutated oligonucleotides MUT1 (ACCGGCACTCCGGAGAAGTCAAG) and MUT2 (GAGTCAACACGGCGACACTGATGT). The resulting recombinant Petase7 and PetM4 proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) from Novagen according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were lysed in 1× binding buffer, containing the protease inhibitor mixture, by three steps of freezing and thawing and brief sonication. The lysate was centrifuged for 30 min at 10,000 × g and the resulting supernatant applied to a Ni2+ His·BindTM column. To ensure the presence of the signal peptide, the N-terminal region was PCR amplified with the following primers designed with the same characteristics as for E. coli: L115PSNter (CTAGCCGGGATCCATCTCGCGTACTATTGTG) and L115Cter (CCGGCCGAATTCTTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGGT- GATGCTCGGGTATCGTTAACGG). The fragment was cloned in the pTEXvector (gift of Dr. J. Kelly (37.Kelly J.M. Ward H.M. Miles M.A. Kendall G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3963-3969Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar)) at EcoRI/BamHI sites giving the pTEX/AcP construction. 108 exponentially growing cells (L. amazonensisLV79) were washed and resuspended in 200 μl of cold electroporation buffer (21 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.7 mm NaH2PO4, 6 mm glucose). 50 μg of plasmid DNA was added and the cells electroporated at 0 °C in 2-mm cuvettes with a Cellject apparatus set on 450 V, 74 W, 600 microfarads, single pulse mode. Cells were transferred to 10 ml of culture medium and 24 h later G418 (10 μg/ml) was added. For purification, 50 ml of the culture supernatant was applied to a 50-ml Q fast flow column 1× binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, 6 mm imidazole). The nonretained fraction was applied to the His·BindTM column and the pTEX/AcP protein eluted as described above. Since the detergent n-octylthioglucoside used in our earlier study (30.Bakalara N. Seyfang A. Davis C. Baltz T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) solubilized, but inactivated, the phosphatase activity, we tested the effect of 0.5% Triton X-100. The resulting PTPase activity in the Triton X-100-solubilized fraction (F4TS) shared the characteristics of the original TbPTPase activity of the F4 membrane fraction (30.Bakalara N. Seyfang A. Davis C. Baltz T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It was sensitive to 200 μmvanadate and 1 mm sodium fluoride, was more active at pH 4 than pH 7, and had a K m value of 10 nmfor Tyr(P)-Raytide. Next we devised a two-step chromatographic purification procedure (Fig. 1). Chromatography on DEAE fast flow at pH 5.6 (Fig. 1, A andB) removed VSG (60 kDa), the major surface protein of the F4TS fraction and two other abundant proteins of 70 and 30 kDa (Fig.1 B). Dephosphorylating activities were recovered (TableI) both in the breakthrough (BT-DEAE) and in the 150 mm NaCl eluate (150EL-DEAE). The specific activity of the 150EL-DEAE on Tyr(P)-Raytide was 32 (±18) pmol/min/mg, which represented a purification of 14 (±4)-fold with a yield of 89% (±10). Purification of the DEAE eluted activity (Fig. 1C) on anO-phospho-l-tyrosine affinity column resulted in a large increase in the tyrosine phosphatase specific activity of the eluate (400EL-AFF) to 206 (±100) pmol/min/mg, which represented a total purification factor of 90 (±20)-fold and a yield of 44% (±20) (Table I). The values of the purification parameters were similar when measured by either a specific (Tyr(P)-Raytide), or a nonspecific (pNPP) substrate, suggesting that the isolated activity dephosphorylated both Tyr(P)-Raytide and pNPP. The optimum activity of the affinity eluted fraction for Tyr(P)-Raytide was at pH 4. Affinity eluted PTPase activity catalyzed the removal of phosphate from Tyr(P)-Raytide with aK m value of 15 nm. These values (not shown) were similar to those estimated for F4 and F4TS. Examination of the 400EL-AFF fraction by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and by Coomassie staining (Fig. 1 D) showed the presence of a major polypeptide of 115-kDa and two minor polypeptides of 66 and 30 kDa. The 30-kDa polypeptide was not well stained by Coomassie. Protein-reconstitution assays (Fig. 1 E) indicated that the PTPase activity was in the 115-kDa polypeptide, which we named 115 acidic phosphatase protein (TryAcP115).Table IPurification summary of tryAcP115 from T. bruceiPurification stepaF4TS, BT, and EL correspond to the triton-solubilized fraction, the nonretained and the salt eluted fractions from the different columns, respectively.

Open table in a new tab 5 μg of TryAcP115 protein were obtained from 1.5 × 1011 bloodstream form trypanosomes. The protein was further purified by 10% reducing SDS-PAGE. Microsequencing of peptides generated by Endo-K cleavage and high performance liquid chromatography purification yielded 2 peptide sequences: 1) RVGYFGSQVISLSGR; and 2) KAFDEWESK (Fig.2 A). Degenerated primers and miniexon primers were designed according to the peptide sequences and the T. brucei spliced leader sequence, respectively. DNA fragments of 330, 760, and 430 base pairs were amplified by RT-PCR with, respectively, the following primer associations, P1CaAS/Mex2, P3CaAS/Mex2, and P1CaS/P3CaAS, and cloned. The nucleotide sequence started as expected at the 5′ end by the miniexon sequence characteristic of trypanosomal mRNA. Moreover, since the 760-base pair fragment coded for the amino acid sequence obtained by microsequencing of peptide 1 and since the three DNA fragment sequences shared identical overlapping regions, we concluded that the 3 amplified fragments resulted from the amplification of the same mRNA. Screening of 2 × 105 clones from the T. brucei cosmid library with the 760-base pair fragment as a probe at high stringency yielded 5 colonies. AKpnI/KpnI fragment of 5000 base pairs containing the entire gene was subcloned and sequenced. This fragment showed an open reading frame of 401 amino acids predicting for a protein of 45 kDa with a calculated pI of 5.62. The algorithm of Kyte and Doolittle (38.Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17209) Google Scholar) revealed two hydrophobic regions between residues 1 and 22 and residues 340 and 362 (Fig. 2 A). The N-terminal region, which is 81% homologous to the first 16 residues of the peptide signal of the ephrin receptor tyrosine kinase family (RPTK) (39.Van der Geer P. Hunter T. Lindberg R.-A. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref Scopus (1245) Google Scholar), may correspond to a signal peptide (Fig. 2B). The C-terminal hydrophobic region is likely to be a membrane-spanning α-helix. The amino acid sequence also predicts eight potential N-glycosylation sites at As"

This heterogeneous film facilitates binding of early commensal colonizing bacteria, including Streptococcus sanguis. To test the hypothesis that sufficient intermolecular organization exists in salivary films to form binding sites forS. sanguis, an in vitro model of saliva-coated teeth was probed with murine anti-idiotypical monoclonal antibodies (mAb2, anti-ids). The anti-ids were harvested from hybridomas that were developed in response to first generation murine hybridomas that produced anti-S. sanguis adhesin monoclonal antibodies (mAb1). The anti-ids (i) reacted with experimental salivary films and inhibited S. sanguis adhesion in a dose-dependent fashion. In Western blots, the anti-ids (ii) recognized a high molecular weight salivary antigen and (iii) secretory IgA (sIgA) light chain and α-amylase. After isolation by gel filtration from whole saliva or mixed secretory IgA and α-amylase, the high molecular weight component, containing amylase activity and sIgA, bound to hydroxyapatite to promote adhesion of S. sanguis.

March P.E. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1998; 9: 252-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Yet the mechanisms by which heterogeneous conditioning films promote selective microbial adhesion are ill defined (2.Palmer Jr., R.J. White D.C. Trends Microbiol. 1997; 5: 435-440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). As the biofilm matures, certain of the attached microbes will colonize the surface. Depending in part on the specificity for adhesion to the conditioning film, microbial biofilms may be beneficial (e.g. the gastrointestinal commensal flora) or harmful (e.g. infected catheters and medical implants and dental plaque). Dental plaque is an example of a complex microbial biofilm;Streptococcus sanguis are among the first or “pioneer” bacteria to adhere selectively and colonize the saliva-coated teeth (3.Gibbons R.J. van Houte J. Beachey E.H. Bacterial Adherence. Receptors and Recognition, Series B. 6. Chapman and Hall, London1980: 62-104Google Scholar). Representing a small proportion (∼1%) of more than 300 species of bacteria in the oral cavity (4.Gibbons R.J. J. Dent. Res. 1996; 75: 866-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), S. sanguis first adheres to a conditioning film of heterogeneous salivary proteins and glycoproteins. The film includes α-amylase and secretory IgA (sIgA)1 (5.Al-Hashimi I. Levine M.J. Arch. Oral Biol. 1989; 34: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 6.Lamkin M.S. Arancillo A.A. Oppenheim F.G. J. Dent. Res. 1996; 75: 803-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and forms largely by adsorption from the surrounding salivary milieu in which it remains. Like most naturally occurring conditioning films, the salivary film on enamel (∼98% hydroxyapatite, HA) has ill defined macromolecular organization and surface boundaries. Salivary macromolecules also change conformation upon adsorption to HA inin vitro models; interactions of the bacteria with salivary components in solution are not representative of adhesion to a salivary film (7.Gibbons R.J. J. Dent. Res. 1989; 68: 750-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 8.Gibbons R.J. Hay D.I. Childs III, W.C. Davis G. Arch.

Actinomyces viscosus and certain other prominent dental plaque bacteria adhere to conformationally sensitive domains on purified salivary proline-rich proteins adsorbed to HA but not in solution (9.Iontcheva I. Oppenheim F.G. Troxler R.F. J. Dent. Res. 1997; 76: 734-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and Staphylococcus aureus andPseudomonas aeruginosa bind to a heterotypic complex of low molecular weight mucin and sIgA in solution but not in solid phase (10.Biesbrock A.R. Reddy M.S. Levine M.J. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 3492-3497Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In solution, sIgA may also complex with other salivary macromolecules to form binding receptors of different specificity for bacterial adhesins (11.Oho T., Yu, H. Yamashita Y. Koga T. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 115-121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When adsorbed on hydroxyapatite (saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (sHA)), kinetic data (7.Gibbons R.J. J. Dent.

Rev. 1992; 8: 199-209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) mechanisms. Because the salivary film lacks apparent intermolecular organization, we tested the hypothesis that conditioning film macromolecules form structures that serve as binding sites for S. sanguis. To overcome the paucity of structural information about the salivary film, we developed a strategy to predict the molecular determinants that serve as binding sites for streptococci on sHA. First, murine anti-S. sanguis 133–79 adhesin monoclonal antibodies (mAb1s) were developed and characterized in a sHA adhesion assay (18.Gong K. Wen D.Y. Ouyang T. Rao A.T. Herzberg M.C. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 3628-3633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,19.Gong K. Herzberg M.C. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3815-3821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). S. sanguis 133–79 was selected to model adhesion, because it binds 3.6 times more effectively to sHA than HA. Anti-S. sanguis 133–79 mAb1.1 and mAb1.2 Fab fragments (or intact mAbs) each showed dose-dependent partial inhibition of adhesion. Together, these two mAbs inhibited adhesion of S. sanguis 133–79 to sHA by a maximum of 63%. Although additional adhesins are expressed, the mAb1s recognized 87- and 150-kDa antigens (19.Gong K. Herzberg M.C. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3815-3821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 150-kDa adhesin contained two different adhesive epitopes, each reacting with either mAb1.1 or -1.2. To immunochemically simulate the specificity of the two respective adhesin epitopes, murine monoclonal anti-idiotype antibodies (mAb2s; anti-ids) were developed using the mAb1.1 and mAb1.2 as antigens (18.Gong K. Wen D.Y. Ouyang T. Rao A.T. Herzberg M.C. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 3628-3633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The antigen-combining site of anti-idiotype antibodies can express a surface substructure or internal image that is a molecular mimic of the original immunizing antigen (20.Jerne N.K. Ann. Immunol. 1974; 125C: 373-389PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Nisonoff A. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 2429-2438PubMed Google Scholar). Reacting with the probes, a complex containing secretory immunoglobulin A and α-amylase was identified as a S. sanguis-binding site. Strain 133–79 was stored and grown as described previously (19.Gong K. Herzberg M.C. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3815-3821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Gong K. Ouyang T. Herzberg M.C. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 5388-5392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thein vitro adherence assay is a modification of that used by Liljemark et al. (22.Liljemark W.F. Bloomquist C.G. Germaine G.R. Infect. Immun. 1981; 31: 935-941Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Tellefson and Germaine (23.Tellefson L.M. Germaine G.R. Infect. Immun. 1986; 51: 750-759Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the assay was performed in 1.5-ml polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes with 1 mmKH2PO4, K2HPO4 buffer, pH 6.8, with 50 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm MgCl2 (Gibbons' buffer) at 20 °C (ambient temperature). Human whole saliva was collected from five adult volunteer donors (procedure reviewed and approved by the Committee on the Use of Human Subjects in Research of the University of Minnesota) into a chilled tube on ice, pooled, and clarified by centrifugation (1,972 × g for 20 min at 4 °C). Whole salivary supernatant (1 ml) was incubated for 60 min to coat 10 mg of HA that had been equilibrated for 60 min with Gibbons' buffer. The sHA was then washed 2 times and transferred into a new tube. Cells of S. sanguis 133–79 were labeled with 10 μCi/ml [methyl-3H]thymidine to a specific activity of 1.6 × 103 ± 280 bacteria/count/min (mean of five experiments, three determinations of each, ±S.E.). Radiolabeled cells (109) were added and mixed with sHA for 60 min by continuous inversion on a roto-torque at ambient temperature. Unattached bacteria were aspirated, and cells loosely associated with the sHA were removed by washing. The radioactivity associated with sHA was monitored by liquid scintillation counting. mAbs against S. sanguisadhesins (mAb1.1 and mAb1.2) were prepared as previously reported (18.Gong K. Wen D.Y. Ouyang T. Rao A.T. Herzberg M.C. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 3628-3633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,19.Gong K. Herzberg M.C. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3815-3821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, BALB/c mice were immunized with live cells of the adhesion positive strain 133–79. Hybridomas were screened for reaction with an adhesion positive strain (133–79) but not with an adhesion negative strain (ATCC 10556) and for the ability to react with strain 133–79 to inhibit adhesion to sHA. These selected mAb1 hybridomas were then injected intraperitoneally into BALB/c mice to produce anti-idiotypic mAb2s. The enlarged spleens were harvested, and mAb2 hybridomas were prepared and screened in indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for reaction with rabbit polyclonal IgG antibodies against the 87- and 150-kDa adhesin antigens. mAb2s from positive clones were then incubated with sHA and tested for inhibition of adhesion of strain 133–79. To learn if mAb2s bind to specific adhesin receptors on salivary film, sHA was blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin, pretreated with increasing amounts of mAb2s, and then incubated for 1 h with S. sanguis in the adhesion assay (19.Gong K. Herzberg M.C. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3815-3821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Gong K. Ouyang T. Herzberg M.C. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 5388-5392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To identify components in the salivary film that may have formed immunochemically unique adhesion receptors for cells of S. sanguis, freshly collected and clarified whole saliva was separated by SDS-PAGE in reduced or nonreduced conditions and reacted with the mAb2s in Western immunoblots (25.Towbin H. Staehlein T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44843) Google Scholar, 26.Gershoni J.M. Palade G.E. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 131: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). In each experiment, nonspecific mouse IgG was used as the negative control. Based on their estimated sizes, isozymes of α-amylase (reduced 58-kDa and unreduced 56- and 58-kDa bands) and immunoglobulin light chain (reduced 25-kDa antigen) were suggested to react with mAb2s. To verify this, the whole saliva was then allowed to react with rabbit anti-α-amylase, anti-IgA (α-chain), or anti-κ light chain in identical conditions or nonspecific rabbit IgG as a negative control. Purified sIgA (colostrum) and purified α-amylase were also allowed to react with mAb2s. To test the possibility that sIgA (or its light chain) and α-amylase form a complex with unusual electrophoretic mobility, human colostral sIgA and α-amylase were mixed (1:16 ratio) for 30 min at 37 °C. The mixture was then separated by SDS-PAGE and allowed to react with mAb2s. Whole human saliva from at least five healthy donors was collected into chilled tubes for each experiment. EDTA was added to a final concentration of 0.01%. Pooled human whole saliva was clarified by centrifugation and then dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 0.1 mNH4HCO3 buffer, pH 8.0, with 0.05% sodium azide. The mAb2-reactive component was isolated by gel filtration chromatography using a protocol modified from Kishimoto et al. (27.Kishimoto E. Hay D.I. Gibbons R.J. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 3702-3707Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, the freshly dialyzed saliva was applied to a column (2.5 × 70 cm) of Superose 6 prep grade (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), which was eluted at 12 ml/h. Pooled fractions were analyzed with SDS-PAGE, diluted serially with 0.1 mNH4HCO3 buffer, and used to coat HA beads, and then adhesion of S. sanguis 133–79 was determined. Adhesion was compared with experimental films formed from serially diluted whole saliva (positive control) or 0.1 mNH4HCO3 buffer (negative control). mAb2.2 affinity column was also used to separate S. sanguisbinding salivary component(s) from whole saliva. mAb2 was immobilized onto Affi-Gel Hz gel (Bio-Rad) by following the manufacturer's instructions. By sampling at each step, the coupling efficiency was determined to be about 1.4 mg of IgG1/ml of Affi-Gel. The column was washed with PBS, and clarified whole saliva was loaded and allowed to incubate for 2 h. After incubation, the column was washed with 2 bed volumes of 0.5 m NaCl and 2 bed volumes of PBS and then eluted with 2 n NaSCN. Eluted salivary proteins were analyzed by 6% SDS-PAGE. Amylase activity was determined by hydrolysis of 1% starch in 1% agarose in PBS (pH 7) prepared in plastic plates. Wells were punched in the starch-agarose (35 μl), filled with an aliquot from each pooled salivary fraction, and incubated for 24 h at room temperature. Amylase activity (expressed in units) was determined from a standard curve (comparing the units of pure amylase with the diameter of the starch digestion zone). Human colostral sIgA (1.25 mg) and salivary α-amylase (10 mg) were mixed to model the 1:8 ratio of these proteins approximated in saliva (28.Aguirre A. Levine M.J. Cohen R.E. Tabak L.A. Arch. Oral Biol. 1987; 32: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The 300-kDa antigen (P2) was isolated by gel filtration as described above. To learn if it functions on sHA as a preferred binding site forS. sanguis 133–79, 20 μg of the recovered 300-kDa antigen (P2) was used to coat 10 mg/ml HA. S. sanguis 133–79 adhesion was compared when HA films were formed from the 300-kDa antigen, 0.1 m NH4HCO3 buffer (negative control), 20 μg each of sIgA, amylase, or P3; sIgA/amylase mixture containing 10 or 20 μg of each; or 20 μg of total protein mixed at a ratio of 1:8 (2.22 μg of sIgA and 17.78 μg of α-amylase) or 1:16. To learn if mAb2s would inhibit adhesion ofS. sanguis 133–79, 10 pmol each of mAb2.1 and -2.2 were mixed and then incubated with the experimental films for 1 h, and then cells of S. sanguis were added. Unrelated murine IgG1 mAbs and products of the IgG1 myeloma clones MOPC-21 and S1–68.1 (unknown specificities) were used as negative controls for the IgG1 mAb2s. The anti-idiotype antibody mAb2.1 (66.7 pmol) bound to sHA, inhibited adhesion of S. sanguis by a maximum of 69%, and showed an ID50 (inhibitory dose, 50%) of 5 pmol/ml (Fig.1). When its idiotype counterpart mAb1.1 was preincubated with sHA in the same conditions, adhesion of strain 133–79 was not significantly affected. In identical conditions, mAb2.2 inhibited adhesion maximally by 35%. Together, these two anti-idiotype antibodies (20 pmol each) inhibited adhesion by 86%. As mimics of the adhesin macromolecules, mAb2.1 and mAb2.2 recognized salivary antigens of 300 and 365 kDa (estimatedM r; unreduced) in Western immunoblot (Fig.2 A, lanes 2 and 3, respectively). Nonspecific mouse IgG reacted only with macromolecules of 180 and 120 kDa as indicated by theasterisks. mAb2.2 also reacted weakly with bands of 56 and 58 kDa (lane 3). After reduction of disulfide bonds with 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME +), the mAb2s reacted only with salivary antigens of 25 and 58 kDa, and nonspecific mouse IgG did not appear to react. The unreduced 300-kDa band also reacted with rabbit anti-immunoglobulin κ-chain (Fig. 2 B,lane 1; 25 kDa after reduction), anti-immunoglobulin α-chain (lane 2; 60 kDa after reduction), and anti-α-amylase (lane 3; 58 kDa after reduction). Nonspecific rabbit IgG reacted only with an unreduced macromolecule of 180 kDa (asterisk). The specific salivary antigens probably complex with other proteins because unreduced antigens of other sizes were also detected. mAb2.2 also reacted with purified sIgA (colostrum) and light chain before and after reduction, respectively, and (in identical conditions) purified α-amylase (Fig. 2 C). mAb2.1 reacted more weakly with amylase and light chain (data not shown). To test the possibility that the 300-kDa salivary macromolecule may be a complex with unusual electrophoretic mobility, human colostral sIgA and α-amylase were mixed (1:16 ratio) for 30 min at 37 °C. Both mAb2s reacted with the mixture of α-amylase and sIgA, including a fraction that migrated at 300 kDa, and reduced light chain and α-amylase (Fig. 2 D). Nonspecific mouse IgG reacted weakly only with an unreduced macromolecule of 180 kDa (asterisk). The mAb2-reactive component was then isolated from whole human saliva by gel filtration chromatography. A representative chromatogram from fractionation of a 12-ml sample of whole saliva shows the four peaks that typically resolved (Fig. 3). Serial dilutions of whole saliva or the four pooled fractions (P1–P4) were used to coat HA beads. A film formed by a 40% dilution of whole saliva, or pooled fraction 2 (P2) or 4 (P4), supported adhesion ofS. sanguis maximally. All dilutions of P1 and P3 weakly promoted adhesion of S. sanguis (data not shown). Among 40% dilutions of the pooled fractions, P2 formed films with the greatest adhesion promotion activity per μg of soluble protein (Fig. 3). Fresh saliva and fractions were necessary for adhesion. After denaturation or dialysis and lyophilization, salivary fractions P1–P4 promoted similar low levels of adhesion, and no dilution effect was seen (data not shown). When visualized by SDS-PAGE, fraction P1 contained trace amounts of the putative 300-kDa component, P2 contained the 300-kDa component, and P3 contained trace amounts of a 56-kDa protein, whereas P4 was enriched in a 56-kDa protein (Fig. 4). The 300-kDa component in P2 reacted in Western blots with mAb2s, rabbit anti-human κ-chain, Ig α-chain, and α-amylase, whereas the 56-kDa antigen reacted with anti-α-amylase (data not shown). Most amylase activity (2.75 units) eluted in P4 as expected (TableI). By comparison, P2 contained 0.045 unit of amylase activity, whereas P1 contained 0.001 unit and P3 contained no detectable activity.Table IAmylase activity associated with fractions from whole salivaFractionsAmount of proteinDiameter of the digestion zoneAmylase activityμgcmunitsWhole saliva5.02.150.549P120.00.950.001P213.01.70.046P313.000P42.52.22.494Amylase activity was determined from a standard curve comparing the units of α-amylase with the diameter of the zone of starch digestion.

Open table in a new tab Amylase activity was determined from a standard curve comparing the units of α-amylase with the diameter of the zone of starch digestion. Peak tubes (highest protein content) were sampled from each fraction as in Fig. 3. After colostral sIgA and α-amylase were mixed and chromatographed, four fractions resolved (chromatogram not shown), each with anRF similar to eluted whole saliva. As noted in the fraction of whole saliva, P2 isolated from the mixture of sIgA and α-amylase also contained amylase activity (TableII). Separate experimental HA films formed from this P1 (sIgA) and P4 (amylase) promoted adhesion by only 7 and 5%, respectively. In contrast, when coated on HA, P2 from the sIgA and amylase mixture promoted S. sanguis adhesion by about 16%. Furthermore, adhesion of strain 133–79 to the HA film formed from P2 isolated from the mixture was inhibited in a dose-response manner by mAb2.1 (Fig. 5). The mAb2s also showed dose-dependent inhibition of binding of strain 133–79 to P2 from saliva (data not shown). In contrast, adhesion ofS. sanguis to buffer-treated or P3-coated HA was unaffected by mAb2.1 (Table II).Table IIAmylase activity and S. sanguis adhesion promotion activity associated with chromatographed fractions from a mixture of sIgA and α-amylaseFractionsaPurified human sIgA and salivary amylase were mixed (1:8) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min.

Open table in a new tab The data from this study and previous reports suggest strongly that specific interactions between cells of S. sanguis and sHA predominate in this model of adhesion (24.Gong K. Ouyang T. Herzberg M.C. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 5388-5392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As mimics of S. sanguis adhesins, the mAb2s react with specific epitope(s) to define an apparent binding receptor for S. sanguis formed on experimental salivary films. The mAb2.1 and mAb2.2 express similar but non-identical specificities (18.Gong K. Wen D.Y. Ouyang T. Rao A.T. Herzberg M.C. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 3628-3633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They appear to act independently to bind different epitopes on sHA for S. sanguis adhesins, inhibit adhesion additively, and differ in their ID50values for adhesion of cells of S. sanguis, but they showed similar patterns of reaction on Western blots with salivary macromolecules. Identified by mAb2s, the sHA binding receptor for S. sanguisis a heterotypic complex of the light chain of sIgA and α-amylase. Macroenzyme complexes of α-amylase and IgA or IgG form in serum and can be elevated in autoimmune and liver diseases (29.Remaley A.T. Wilding P. Clin. Chem. 1989; 35: 2261-2270Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). We now show that complexes of sIgA-light chain and amylase form in saliva or are reconstituted from purified individual proteins. Whether formed by purified macromolecules or isolated from saliva, the sIgA-amylase complexes are surrogates for a binding receptor expressed in the film formed on HA by whole saliva. The mAb2s do not bind the complex in saliva. A mAb2.2 affinity column failed to bind antigens from whole saliva (data not shown). The conformational dependence of the binding complex may enable S. sanguis to bind to salivary films formed on high energy surfaces such as HA or nitrocellulose but avoid anti-adhesion interactions with these proteins in the salivary fluid. It is now clear that there is ample immunochemically defined structure in experimentally produced salivary films to serve as specific adhesion receptors. In the heterogeneous salivary biofilm, it would also be expected that interactions be promoted between multiple salivary proteins. The complexes that form may provide binding receptors of different specificities for the pioneer streptococci and other early colonizers. The structural characteristics of these binding receptors need to be further studied. To define space-fitting models of the receptors, we speculate that predictions could be made from structural characterization of the idiotopes of the mAb1s and new mAb3s, now in development. If proteinaceous complexes serve as a general adhesion mechanism for adhesion to conditioning films, binding sites and biofilm development may be modified for prevention and therapy by the development of novel antibiotic and biomimetic compounds.

Growth of the cell plate requires continuous fusion of vesicles, and phragmoplastin appears to play a role in the formation of vesicle-tubule-vesicle structures at the cell plate. In this study, we have demonstrated that two self-assembly domains (SA1 and SA2) are involved in polymerization of phragmoplastin. SA1 is about 42 amino acids long and is located near the N terminus overlapping with the GTP-binding region. SA2, containing at least 24 amino acids, is located in the middle of the molecule outside the GTP-binding domain. Peptides containing either SA1 or SA2 interact efficiently with the full-length phragmoplastin. The SA1 domain of one phragmoplastin molecule also binds to SA2 of another as confirmed in vitro by using radiolabeled peptides. This interaction leads to the formation of polymers with a staggered contoured spiral structure. Electron microscopy studies revealed that helical arrays of phragmoplastin can be induced by reducing salt concentration.

Dynamin-like proteins have been isolated from a variety of eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to plants to humans. These proteins are mostly membrane-bound with different subcellular locations and have been implicated in diverse biological processes, including vesicle formation, protein sorting, resistance to viral infection, mitochondrial and chloroplast biogenesis, endocytosis, and cell plate formation (1.Gu X.

McNiven M.A. De Camilli P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Phragmoplastin also lacks the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that mediates the binding of dynamin to membranes containing acidic phospholipids (12.Klein D.E. Lee A. Frank D.W. Marks M.S. Lemmon M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27725-27733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Ability to self-assemble into helical arrays is one of the common features shared by dynamin family of proteins. One class of the dynamin homologues, Mx proteins, can polymerize into helical structures that are 11 nm thick and 100–150 nm long (13.Nakayama M. Yzaki K. Kusano A. Nagata K. Hanai N. Ishihama A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15033-15038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mx proteins contain a “self-assembly” domain that is conserved in the dynamin family of proteins (14.Nakayama M. Nagata K. Kato A. Ishihama A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21404-21408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), including phragmoplastin (1.Gu X. Verma D.P.S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 695-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Dynamins can form helical structures both in solution and in vivo (15.Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 16.Takei K. McPherson P.S. Schmid S.L. De Camilli P. Nature. 1995; 374: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). This property enables dynamin to wrap around the base of clathrin-coated pits and constricts their neck upon addition of GTP (17.Sweitzer S.M. Hinshaw J.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 1021-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 18.McNiven M.A. Cell. 1998; 94: 151-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Dynamin alone is sufficient for the formation of constricted necks of coated pits (17.Sweitzer S.M. Hinshaw J.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 1021-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). By hydrolyzing GTP, it functions as a force-generating molecule responsible for the fission of membrane vesicles. The presence of lipid promotes the formation of polymeric complexes of dynamin (15.Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Self-assembly of dynamin does not require guanine nucleotides, but GTP binding promotes self-assembly, whereas GTP hydrolysis may trigger disassembly of dynamin polymers (17.Sweitzer S.M. Hinshaw J.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 1021-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Assembly of dynamin into spirals can be induced by the addition of GDP and γ-phosphate analogues under physiological conditions (19.Carr J.F. Hinshaw J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28030-28035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Multiple peptide domains have been implicated in self-assembly of dynamin and its homolog proteins, including Dnm1p/Vps1p-like (DVLP). Whereas the C-terminal proline rich domain of dynamin is not required for self-assembly (19.Carr J.F. Hinshaw J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28030-28035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), DVLP contains a conserved domain DVH2 (for Dnm1/Vps1homology 2) at the C terminus that is involved in oligomerization of DVLP (20.Shin H.W. Takatsu H. Mukai H. Munekata E. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2780-2785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The process of dynamin self-assembly may be accounted for by both intra- and intermolecular interactions between three different protein domains (21.Smirnova E. Shurland D.L. Newman-Smith E.D. Pishvaee B. van der Bliek A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14942-14947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Coiled-coils have also been demonstrated to be involved in dynamin self-assembly (22.Okamoto P.M. Tripet B. Litowski J. Hodges R.S. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10277-10286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, they may not play a role in phragmoplastin self-assembly, because the probability of coiled-coil formation in phragmoplastin is very low (only 20%). These data suggest that members of the dynamin family may form helical structures using different domains that provide intra- and intermolecular interactions. Assembly and disassembly of dynamin-like proteins on the surface of biological membranes may provide a mechanism to control vesicle budding, vesicle fusion, and the formation of new membrane systems, such as vesicle-tubule-vesicle structures, that occur during cell plate formation. Phragmoplastin appears to be a “simpler” molecule than dynamin and Mx proteins because it does not contain the proline-rich domain or leucine zipper at the C terminus and lacks the pleckstrin homology domain. Nevertheless, this protein retains the ability to form oligomers of its own and forms complexes with other proteins (6.Gu X. Verma D.P.S. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 157-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). 1Z. Hong, Z. Zhang, and D. P. S. Verma, unpublished data. 1Z. Hong, Z. Zhang, and D. P. S. Verma, unpublished data. Using a yeast two-hybrid system in combination with an in vitroprotein-protein interaction assay, we identified two domains that are involved in phragmoplastin oligomerization leading to the formation of helical arrays that may facilitate formation of vesicle-tubule-vesicle structures at the cell plate. Escherichia coli DH5α and Top10F′ were used for plasmid construction. HB101 was used to recover plasmids from yeast cells. Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) Y190 (MATa,ura3–52, his3–200, lys2–801, ade2–101, trp1–901, leu2–3, 112, gal4Δ, gal80Δ,cyh r 2,LYS::GAL1 UAS-HIS3 TATA-HIS3,URA3::GAL1 UAS-GAL1 TATA-lacZ) was used as the host for two-hybrid experiments. Full-length phragmoplastin cDNA (pSDL12a) (1.Gu X. Verma D.P.S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 695-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) was partially digested with BglII andXhoI, and the 2-kb2 fragment was ligated into the pAS1-CYH2 and pACT2 vectors, generating pAS-Phr and pACT-Phr, respectively. The BglII-XhoI fragment was also inserted at the BamHI-SalI sites of pUC18. The resulting plasmid (pUC-Phr) was digested withSmaI-BamHI, and the insert was subcloned into the same sites of pACT2, generating pACT-BH1. pACT-BL2 expressing the SA1 domain of phragmoplastin was constructed by subcloning aSmaI-BglII fragment (0.57 kb) from pUC-Phr into the SmaI-BamHI sites of pACT2. AHincII fragment was released from pUC-Phr, followed by self-ligation, generating pUC-HC2Δ. pACT-HC2 containing the SA2 domain was made by subcloning a SmaI-BamHI fragment (0.9 kb) into pACT2. For construction of pACT-H3, aSmaI-HindIII fragment (0.75 kb) was transferred from pUC-HC2Δ to pBluescript II SK(−) to give pBS-HC2Δ, from which a SmaI-XhoI fragment was subcloned into the same sites of pACT2. pACT-DR1 was constructed by cloning aDraI-BamHI fragment (0.62 kb) into theSmaI-BamHI sites of pACT2. To assay protein-protein interaction, cDNAs encoding the respective peptides were subcloned into pAS2 in-frame with the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 and into pACT2 in-frame with the transcription activation domain. Yeast Y190 was transformed with the two plasmids by electroporation followed by selection on yeast synthetic complete medium (SC-Trp-Leu). Colonies were transferred to interaction medium (SC-Trp-Leu-His containing 30 mg/liter 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole). Colonies growing on SC-Trp-Leu medium were adsorbed to 3MM filter discs, permeabilized by liquid nitrogen, and incubated in Z buffer/X-Gal (120 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm β-mercarptoethanol, 300 mg/liter X-Gal). Development of blue/white color was scored 2–10 h later. Yeast cells grown in liquid selection medium containing 2% raffinose were pelleted and washed twice with phosphate-saline buffer. The pellet was resuspended in a lysis solution (100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol). After incubation at 4 °C for 20 min, cells were permeabilized by two freeze-thaw cycles (23.Nevels M. Wolf H. Dobner T. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 57-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Cell extracts were added to a reaction buffer (3 mmmethyl-umbelliferyl-β-d-galactopyranoside in 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mmMgCl2). After incubation for 60 min at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated by the addition of an equal volume of stop buffer (300 mm glycine, 15 mm EDTA, pH 11.5). The mixture was diluted, and fluorescence was recorded in a fluorometer (24.Jain V.K. Magrath I.T. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). pAS-Phr expressing the full-length phragmoplastin was used as a bait to screen an Arabidopsis cDNA library constructed in the λ-ACT vector (25.Kim J. Harter K. Theologis A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11786-11791Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). One of the interacting clones, pACT-AtC, contained a partial fragment of the ADL1 cDNA and was sequenced. A full-length phragmoplastin was fused with GST by inserting theSmaI-XhoI fragment from pACT-Phr into the same sites of pGEX-KG (26.Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar), generating pGST-Phr. ASmaI-EcoRI fragment from pACT-BL2 encoding the SA1 domain was ligated into the same sites of pGEX-KG, generating pGST-SA1. Plasmid pGST-SA2 was constructed by subcloning aSmaI-EcoRI fragment from pACT-HC2 into the same sites of pGEX-KG. Expression of GST fusion proteins was induced by 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h. Cells were washed and resuspended in STE buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA). After incubation with 100 μg/ml lysozyme for 5 min, cells were lysed in the presence of 0.5% sarkosyl followed by sonication (27.Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). The supernatant was diluted with Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 1% and incubated with glutathione-agarose-beads (Sigma) followed by extensive washing with STE buffer. A35S-labeled peptide containing the SA2 domain was obtained by subcloning a BamHI fragment from pGST-SA2 into the same site of pAGA3 (Promega, Madison, WI) in-frame with the vector ATG initiation codon under the T7 promoter. The resulting construct, pAGA3-SA2, was used for TNT-T7 Quick-Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine. Radiolabeled SA2 product (10 μl) was diluted in 260 μl of interaction buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5% lubral, 0.5% bovine serum albumin) and incubated with 10 μl of purified GST fusion protein bound to glutathione-agarose-beads for 1 h. The beads were washed five times with the interaction buffer without bovine serum albumin, and the bound proteins were eluted directly in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer. After electrophoresis, the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue R-250, dried, and autoradiographed. GST-phragmoplastin, purified by glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma), was eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione in HCB (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 150 mm NaCl (HCB150, high salt buffer). Glutathione was removed by passing through a Sephadex G25 column in high salt buffer. The sample was dialyzed against a low salt buffer (HCB15, HCB containing 15 mmNaCl) overnight at 4 °C. Dialyzed phragmoplastin was incubated with 10 μm GTPγS or GTP for 30 min. Samples (∼ 0.1 mg/ml protein) were adsorbed to Formvar-coated grids and stained with 2% uranyl acetate followed by air drying. Electron micrographs were obtained using a Philips 400 electron microscope at 80 kV. Intermolecular Interaction of Phragmoplastin in the Yeast Two-hybrid System—Using a cross-linking approach, we previously reported that soybean phragmoplastin forms homo-oligomers (6.Gu X. Verma D.P.S. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 157-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This was explained by the presence in phragmoplastin of a self-assembly domain similar to that described in Mx proteins (28.Melen K. Ronni T. Broni B. Krug R.M. von Bonsdorff C.H. Julkunen I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25898-25907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During the course of screening for phragmoplastin-interacting proteins using the yeast two-hybrid system, we isolated from an Arabidopsis library several isoforms of phragmoplastin-like proteins that lacked the N-terminal half of the molecule, where the self-assembly domain is located. These results suggested that an additional domain(s) must exist in the second half of the protein that allows intermolecular interaction. We subcloned soybean phragmoplastin cDNA in both pAS2 and pACT2 and determined the domains involved in the assembly of phragmoplastin that can be assayed using the two-hybrid system. Data in Fig. 1 demonstrate that cells expressing phragmoplastin from both vectors grow well on His− SC medium containing 30 mm of SC-Trp-Leu-His and 30 mg/liter 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, suggesting that an interaction occurs between phragmoplastin molecules. When phragmoplastin was fused only with the DNA-binding domain in pAS2, or only with the transcription activation domain in pACT2, or when two empty vectors were used, the yeast cells were not able to grow on His− SC medium. The self-interaction was very strong, as revealed by X-Gal reaction that took less than 1 h to develop blue color (data not shown). β-Galactosidase activity assays produced consistent results with His selection experiments and X-Gal reaction. This interaction was equally strong when the self-assembly domain was missing (see below), suggesting the presence of a new domain that has not yet been described in the dynamin family of proteins. A set of deletion constructs were made to delimit peptide domains required for self-interaction of phragmoplastin. TheBglII fragment (amino acids 1–185) contains a peptide domain (amino acids 49–93) that was previously thought to be responsible for phragmoplastin self-interaction because this domain is homologous to the self-assembly domain (amino acids 51–96) of mouse Mx1 protein (13.Nakayama M. Yzaki K. Kusano A. Nagata K. Hanai N. Ishihama A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15033-15038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The deletion fragments were subcloned in pACT2 vector in-frame with the transcription activation domain of Gal4 (Fig.2). For interaction, full-length phragmoplastin was fused with the DNA-binding domain (pAS-Phr). As expected, phragmoplastin was able to interact with the peptide encoded by the BglII fragment, suggesting that this region contains SA1 (Fig. 3 A). The peptides encoded by the HincII and HindIII fragments, respectively, which lacked the SA1 domain, were also able to efficiently interact with the full-length phragmoplastin, whereas theDraI fragment-generated peptide completely lost the interaction ability. pACT-AtC obtained from library screening using the full-length phragmoplastin as a bait (see under “Experimental Procedures”) is a partial ADL1 clone that is 72 base pairs longer than the DraI fragment at the 5′ end, encoding 24 amino acids. This suggests that the peptide between amino acid residues 347–371 of phragmoplastin represents a new self-assembly domain (referred as SA2). Amino acid sequence comparison of the SA2 domain with members of the dynamin family revealed a limited homology in this region (Fig. 3 B). The role of SA2 homologous domains in the polymerization of dynamin and Mx proteins remains to be determined (see under “Discussion”). The data also suggested that the C-terminal 30 amino acids are not involved in self-assembly, because removal of this region did not affect the interaction (pACT-BH1).Figure 3Alignment of amino acid sequences of the two self-assembly domains of phragmoplastin and their homologous regions in the dynamin protein family. Amino acid sequences of soybean phragmoplastin (GmPhr), Arabidopsis dynamin-like protein 1 (AtADL1) (GenBankTM accession number L36939), AtADL2 (AF012833), human dynamin 1 (HsDyn1) (L07807), HsDyn2 (L36983), rat dynamin 3 (RnDyn3) (D14076), human MxA (HsMxA) (M30817), HsMxB (M30818), human dynamin-related protein 1 (HsDRP1) (AF000430), yeast Vps1 (ScVps1) (P21576), ScDnm1 (L40588), and ScMgm1 (X62834) were aligned using DNA Star software. The aligned regions corresponding to phragmoplastin amino acid residues 51–96 and 347–371 are presented inA (SA1 domain) and B (SA2 domain), respectively. In parentheses are numbers of amino acid residues that were omitted to maximize the alignment. The dynamin signature motif is marked by asterisks. Positions of the first amino acid residues of SA1 and SA2 in the proteins are indicated on theleft.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test whether SA1 interacts only with itself or whether it interacts with SA2 of another molecule, and to eliminate possible effects of vectors, we subcloned the BglII and HincII fragments, respectively, in both vectors (pAS2 and pACT2) and tested different combinations of the plasmids in the two-hybrid system. Full-length phragmoplastin served as a positive control in this experiment. Fig.4 shows that SA1 does not have binding affinity toward itself but interacts with SA2. SA2, on the other hand, may interact with itself and SA1. To exclude the possibility that SA2 region may activate transcription on its own, we used “empty” vector pACT2 as a negative control plasmid along with pAS-SA2 to transform the yeast cells. These cells were negative in X-Gal assay, suggesting that SA2 cannot act as a transcription activator and that the X-Gal staining is brought about through protein-protein interaction. Although the importance of SA2-SA2 interaction in phragmoplastin polymerization is not clear at this point, the interaction between SA1 and SA2 could be significant as it may provide a novel mechanism for the formation of phragmoplastin polymers in a staggered helical array (see under “Discussion”). To test whether any other protein component(s) may be required for the interaction between two phragmoplastin fragments, we used radiolabeled peptide from in vitro translated SA2 to react with purified phragmoplastin deletion fragments. Full-length phragmoplastin and theBglII and HincII fragments were cloned in pGEX-KG vector in-frame with GST. The recombinant proteins were expressed inE. coli and purified as GST fusion proteins using glutathione-agarose beads. The 35S-labeled peptides were obtained by in vitro translation and were reacted with purified GST fusion proteins bound to glutathione-agarose beads. As shown in Fig. 5, GST alone did not react with 35S-labeled SA2. GST fusion with SA1, SA2, and the full-length phragmoplastin interacted with 35S-labeled SA2 product, suggesting that SA2 can interact with SA1, SA2, and the full-length phragmoplastin. These results are consistent with that obtained in vivo using the yeast two-hybrid system and provide further evidence for the intermolecular interaction between SA1 and SA2 domains. More importantly, this experiment demonstrated that such an interaction occurs through direct contact and that no additional protein is required. Purified phragmoplastin under high salt conditions (HCB150) did not polymerize and appeared to exist predominantly as monomers and dimers, as shown by negative-stain electron micrographs (Fig.6 A). Polymerization could be induced by dialysis against a low salt buffer (HCB15; Fig. 6,B and D). The presence of 10 μm GTP reversed the polymerization process and disassembled the helical structures into oligomers (data not shown). Incubation with GTPγS, a nonhydrolyzable analog of GTP, maintained the helical structures, suggesting that hydrolysis of GTP by phragmoplastin GTPase results in disassembly of helical arrays. Comparison of the helical arrays formed with or without the presence of GTPγS revealed that addition of GTPγS makes the helical arrays into more compact structures (Fig. 6,B and C). These results may be improved by using native phragmoplastin peptides. These data demonstrate that assembly of phragmoplastin into higher order helical structures can be induced by reducing salt concentration in the buffer without the presence of GTP. Hydrolysis of GTP appears to alter the stereo-structure of helical arrays and disassembles the arrays into oligomers. Members of the dynamin family including phragmoplastin have been shown to form polymers. These polymers are formed in a highly ordered manner, a process known as self-assembly. The process of self-assembly can be demonstratedin vitro. Native dynamin can be extracted in high salt (300 mm NaCl) buffer. When salt concentrations were reduced to 25–50 mm by dialysis, dynamin spontaneously self-assembled into a mixture of partial rings, intact rings, and small stacks of interconnected rings (15.Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). The ring stacks can further assemble into striking tubules of dynamin that can be reversibly disassembled into simple structures. Similar helical arrays of dynamin have also been observed in vivo, being bound to microtubules (29.Shpetner H.S. Vallee R.B. Cell. 1989; 59: 421-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 30.Maeda K. Nakata T. Noda Y. Sato-Yoshitake R. Hirokawa N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1181-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), or as coats surrounding tubular membrane invaginations in nerve terminals (16.Takei K. McPherson P.S. Schmid S.L. De Camilli P. Nature. 1995; 374: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar, 31.Takei K. Mundigl O. Daniell L. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1237-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). We dissected the structural components required for self-assembly of phragmoplastin and demonstrated here that two self-assembly domains (SA1 and SA2) are involved in this process. One of them, SA1, is homologous to the so-called self-assembly domain identified in Mx1 and other dynamin family of proteins (14.Nakayama M. Nagata K. Kato A. Ishihama A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21404-21408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SA1 is located between consensus sequence I (GXXXXGK(S/T)) and consensus II (DXXG) of the tripartite GTP-binding motif. SA1 is 48 amino acids long in mouse Mx1 but is 6 amino acids shorter in phragmoplastin. It consists of two parts: region 1 is highly conserved among members of the dynamin family and contains the “dynamin signature” motif (LP(R/G)(S/T/N)(G/N)IVTR). Region 2 of SA1 is variable in length and has little homology among dynamin-like proteins (Fig. 3). Our data demonstrated that SA2 (24 amino acids long) is necessary for phragmoplastin self-interaction. However, it is not clear whether this fragment of 24 amino acids alone is sufficient for the interaction. This region could be part of a longer domain. SA2 shows limited homology among dynamin-like proteins. It is not known whether the homologous SA2 domain in dynamins is indeed involved in self-assembly. Human MxA contains a C-terminal leucine zipper that can interact with an internal region of the MxA molecule. Intermolecular interaction between the leucine zipper and the internal region leads to the formation of MxA polymers (32.Schumacher B. Staeheli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28365-28370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Human dynamin, yeast Vps1, and plant phragmoplastin do not contain a leucine zipper but may use the SA2 domain instead. We do not have evidence so far for an intramolecular interaction between SA1 and SA2, which would otherwise cause a significant conformational change (N-terminal forward folding). Our results also suggest that the SA2 domains of two phragmoplastin molecules can interact with each other. The significance of such an interaction, if taking place in planta, also remains to be elucidated. In this report, we have presented evidence obtained both from yeast two-hybrid system (in vivo) and in vitro experiments, to demonstrate that SA1 and SA2 interact intermolecularly with each other. Continuous interaction between SA1 of one molecule and SA2 of the other will lead to the formation of a staggered polymeric helical structure (Fig.6 F). The length of such structures may be controlled by GTP hydrolysis and interaction with other proteins. Whereas the exact molecular shape of the purified native phragmoplastin remains to be determined through x-ray crystallography, GST-fused phragmoplastin molecules do not appear to be “rod-shaped” as shown on negative stained electron micrographs (Fig. 6 A). Interactions between SA1 and SA2 of neighboring molecules may lead to the formation of a helical array (Fig. 6 F). Purified phragmoplastin indeed forms helical structures when the salt concentrations were reduced slowly by dialysis to 15 mm NaCl (Fig. 6). Such helical arrays can be disassembled by the presence of GTP (data not shown) but not GTPγS. Similar helical structures have also been observed in dynamin and Mx proteins in vitro and in vivo (15.Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 16.Takei K. McPherson P.S. Schmid S.L. De Camilli P.

Cell. 1998; 94: 131-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Assembly and disassembly of phragmoplastin in plant cells could be regulated by many other factors, such as lipid attachment, or through interaction with other proteins. Five morphological steps have been distinguished during cell plate formation: the transport of Golgi-derived vesicle to the equatorial region, the formation of thin dumbbell-shaped tubules, the consolidation of tubulovesicular network into a plate-like structure, the fusion of cell plate with the parental cell wall, and the deposition of cellulose on the cell plate (34.Samuels A.L. Giddings T.H. Staehelin L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1345-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Phragmoplastin is detected immediately after the Golgi-derived vesicles begin to fuse to form the early cell plate. As the cell plate grows, phragmoplastin redistributes from the center to the growing edges of the outwardly expanding cell plate (6.Gu X. Verma D.P.S. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 157-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The tight temporal and spatial correlation between the formation of the tubulovesicular network and the distribution of phragmoplastin suggests that phragmoplastin may be involved in the formation of thin dumbbell-shaped tubules observed at the forming cell plate (34.Samuels A.L. Giddings T.H. Staehelin L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1345-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). These structures are apparently coated with a fuzzy layer that could be phragmoplastin polymers. Direct localization of phragmoplastin on such structure may be difficult due to the poor preservation of such structures (34.Samuels A.L. Giddings T.H. Staehelin L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1345-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Similar structures have also been observed in tubular membrane invaginations in nerve terminals or isolated endosome vesicles formed in the presence of GTPγS (15.Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 16.Takei K. McPherson P.S. Schmid S.L. De Camilli P. Nature. 1995; 374: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). That GTP hydrolysis may be delayed at vesicle-tubule-vesicle is suggested by the fact that a GTPase-minus mutant form of phragmoplastin remains in the Golgi bodies and is unable to reach to the cell plate during cytokinesis. 3Z. Hong and D. P. S. Verma, unpublished data. This property of phragmoplastin and the timing of GTP hydrolysis may be critical in forming tubular structures at the cell plate, which are necessary for making a fenestrated structure. The KNOLLE gene product that encodes a novel syntaxin (35.Lauber M.H. Waizenegger I. Steinmann T. Schwarz H. Mayer U. Hwang I. Lukowitz W. Jurgens G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1485-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) may be involved in the fusion of the vesicle-tubule-vesicle structures into stellated bodies, creating a fenestrated network that prevents vesicle-vesicle fusion. 4D. P. S. Verma, submitted for publication. Further characterization of phragmoplastin-associated proteins may reveal the mechanism by which such structures are formed during cell plate formation in plants. This unique process ensures the building of a flattened wall at cytokinesis.

Tup1 and Ssn6 have been shown to form a corepressor complex that is recruited to the DNA by interaction with sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins such as Matα2, Rox1, Mig1, and the Crt repressor (2.Keleher C.A.

The Tup1·Ssn6 corepressor complex has been estimated by sucrose gradient sedimentation and by gel densitometry to contain three or four Tup1 subunits and one Ssn6 subunit (12.Varanasi U.S. Klis M.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4757-4769Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), Tup1 appears to play the predominant role, because the defect in repression that results from deletion of both the Ssn6 and Tup1 genes can be overcome by overexpression of Tup1, but not Ssn6 (19.Komachi K. Redd M.J. Johnson A.D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2857-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Moreover, Ssn6-LexA fusions repress transcription in a Tup1-dependent manner, whereas Tup1-LexA fusions can repress transcription in the absence of Ssn6 (20.Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Nature. 1994; 369: 758-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The mechanism of repression by Tup1·Ssn6 is not well understood, although there is evidence that it occurs by either direct interaction with the polymerase II holoenzyme (21.Wahi M. Komachi K. Johnson A.D. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 447-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 22.Kuchin S. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1163-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) or by altering local chromatin structure (23.Cooper J.P. Roth S.Y. Simpson R.T. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1400-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 24.Edmondson D.G. Smith M.M. Roth S.Y. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1247-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). The functional domains of the 713-amino acid Tup1 protein from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been analyzed by genetic and biochemical approaches. The N-terminal residues 1–72 contain sequences that are involved in complex formation with Ssn6 (20.Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Nature. 1994; 369: 758-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) as well as mediating multimerization of Tup1 (12.Varanasi U.S. Klis M. Mikesell P.B. Trumbly R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6707-6714Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 20.Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Nature. 1994; 369: 758-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Residues 120–334 contain sequences that mediate transcriptional repression, as determined by the inability of Tup1 fragments lacking this region to repress transcription (20.Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Nature. 1994; 369: 758-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The C-terminal half of Tup1 (residues 334–713) consists of a domain that contains seven WD40 repeats. These repeats, also known as β-transducin motifs (1.Mukai Y. Harashima S. Oshima Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3773-3779Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Fong H.K. Hurley J.B. Hopkins R.S. Miake-Lye R. Johnson M.S. Doolittle R.F. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2162-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 26.Williams F.E. Trumbly R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6500-6511Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), are present in many proteins that are involved in diverse cellular processes and have been suggested to mediate protein-protein interactions. In the case of Tup1, the WD motif has been shown to interact with the mating-type regulator, Matα2 (19.Komachi K. Redd M.J. Johnson A.D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2857-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 27.Komachi K. Johnson A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6023-6028Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Both the sequence and the biological function of Tup1 are conserved in the yeast Candida albicans whose 515-residue Tup1 protein is 48% identical to theS. cerevisiae Tup1 protein. Moreover, expression of theC. albicans Tup1 gene fully complements a tup1deletion in S. cerevisiae (28.Braun B.R. Johnson A.D. Science. 1997; 277: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Ssn6 is a 966-amino acid protein that contains at its N terminus a domain of 10 tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR)1 (residues 46–398) that is essential for its function (3.Schultz J. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3637-3645Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 14.Schultz J. Marshall-Carlson L. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4744-4756Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The TPR is a motif of 34 amino acids found in over 30 proteins from a variety of organisms that have diverse cellular functions (for review see Ref. 29.Goebl M. Yanagida M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 173-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Distinct combinations of TPR motifs are required for direct interaction with Tup1 and for repression of distinct classes of genes (11.Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 821-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). For example, the first three TPR motifs are sufficient for binding to Tup1 (11.Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 821-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) and to Matα2 (30.Smith R.L. Redd M.J. Johnson A.D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2903-2910Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and for repression of mating-type regulated genes (11.Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 821-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Repeats 1–7 are necessary for the repression of oxygen-regulated genes, whereas all the TPR motifs are required for repression of DNA damage-regulated genes (11.Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 821-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). As seen in the crystal structure of the 3-TPR domain of the protein phosphatase 5 (PP5) (31.Das A.K. Cohen P.W. Barford D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1192-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar), a single TPR folds to form a pair of antiparallel α-helices of equal length. Successive TPRs pack against one another in tandem and are related by a small rotation. The uniform angular and spatial arrangement of neighboring α-helices generates a right-handed superhelix with a central groove (31.Das A.K. Cohen P.W. Barford D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1192-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). In the present study, we use a surface plasmon resonance-based assay to quantitate the interaction between the N-terminal tetramerization domain of Tup1 and the minimal 3-TPR domain of S. cerevisiaeSsn6 that is sufficient for mediating interactions with Tup1 (20.Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Nature. 1994; 369: 758-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). We show that the affinity for Ssn6 of both the S. cerevisiaeand C. albicans Tup1 is comparable, whereas the S. cerevisiae Tup1 containing an L62R substitution binds 100-fold more weakly to Ssn6. Equilibrium ultracentrifugation of the wild type and mutant proteins shows that this mutation, which has a deleterious effect on Tup1-mediated repression in vivo, does not interfere with the tetramerization of Tup1 and is therefore likely to lie on the surface of the Tup1 tetramer. Using a combination of analytical ultracentrifugation, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, proteolysis, 1H NMR, and x-ray fiber diffraction, we characterize structural features of the tetramerization domain. We find that this domain is highly nonglobular in shape and associates to form a type of α-helical coiled coil. These results are used to propose a model for the structure of the N-terminal domain of Tup1 and its interaction with the TPR domain of Ssn6. The modification of the cDNA encoding the N-terminal domain of Tup1 carrying the mutation Leu-62 → Arg (Sc mut62 Tup1) was obtained with the QuickChangeTM mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the instructions of the manufacturer. The cDNAs encoding the respective N-terminal domains of S. cerevisiae Tup1 (Sc N91 Tup1; residues 1–91) and of C. albicans Tup1 (Ca N92 Tup1; residues 1–92) as well as the N-terminal domain of Tup1 carrying the mutation Leu-62 → Arg (Sc mut62 Tup1) were cloned in the pET 3d vector (Novagen). Each fragment is preceded by an additional methionine and is expressed in Escherichia coli under control of the T7 promoter. BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium with 100 μg/ml ampicillin, induced at mid-log phase with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and grown for 3 h at 25 °C. The bacterial cell pellet was sonicated in 1× phosphate-buffered saline, 0.8 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Igepal, and 1 mm EDTA. The lysate was centrifuged at 8500 rpm in a GSA rotor for 15 min. The protein was precipitated with 20% ammonium sulfate and resuspended in 50 mm Tris (pH 8), 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. Ion exchange chromatography was performed on the protein solution with a Q Fast Flow column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) followed by a MonoQ column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In each case, protein solutions were loaded onto columns equilibrated in 50 mm Tris (pH 8), 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA and eluted with a 0.05–1 m NaCl gradient. Peak fractions were pooled and purified by gel filtration using a Superdex 75 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 50 mm Tris (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. Proteins were then dialyzed against 10 mm Tris (pH 8) and 25 mm NaCl, concentrated to 10 mg/ml, and stored at −80 °C. The cDNA encoding the first three TPR motifs of S. cerevisiae Ssn6 (residues 31–149) was cloned in the pET 16b vector (Novagen), which directs protein expression in E. coli under control of the T7 promoter. The Ssn6 fragment is preceded by a 10 histidine tag and the sequence SSGHIQGAH, which contains a factor Xa cleavage site. BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium with 100 μg/ml ampicillin, induced at mid-log phase with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and grown for 3 h at 25 °C. The bacterial cell pellet was sonicated in 1× phosphate-buffered saline, 0.8 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Igepal, 1 mm EDTA, and 2 m urea. The lysate was centrifuged in a GSA rotor at 8500 rpm for 15 min, after which the protein was found in the insoluble fraction. This fraction was resuspended in 20 mm Tris (pH 8), 500 mm NaCl, and 6M urea, filtered, and loaded onto a HisTrap column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 20 mm Tris (pH 8), 500 mm NaCl, and 6 m urea. The elution was performed with a 0–1 m imidazole gradient. Peak fractions were pooled, diluted to 10 μg/ml, and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris (pH 8) and 50 mm NaCl. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were conducted using a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with an optical absorbance system. Runs were carried out at 9000, 10,000, 13,000, 15,000, 20,000, and 27,000 rpm at 20 °C. Six-channel, charcoal-filled epon centerpieces with quartz windows were used in an An-60 Ti rotor. Samples at concentrations of 1.7, 0.8, and 0.4 mg/ml, in 50 mm Tris (pH 8) and 150 mm NaCl were analyzed. Cells were loaded with 100 μl of protein sample and 110 μl of reference buffer. Radial scans at 280 nm were collected between 5.9 and 7.2 cm as the average of five measurements, with a step size of 0.001 cm. The samples were allowed to achieve sedimentation equilibrium over the course of 26 h and were judged to be at equilibrium when sequential scans 2 h apart were superimposable. The proteins' partial specific volumes (Sc N91 Tup1, 0.726 g/ml and Sc mut62 Tup1, 0.7241 g/ml), buffer density (1.0058 g/ml), buffer viscosity (1.0312 × 10−2 poise), and temperature corrections were determined using standard methods (for review of methods, see Ref. 32.Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.M. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, London1992: 90-125Google Scholar), as implemented in the SEDNTERP program. Sedimentation equilibrium data were analyzed using the appropriate functions by nonlinear least squares procedures (33.Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar) provided in the Beckman Optima XL-A software package. For data analysis according to discrete self-association models, the following general equation was used, C(r)=δ+C1.0exp(ς(r2−r02))+∑N>1C1.0NKNexp(Nς(r2−r02))Equation 1 where C(r) is the total concentration at radius r, δ is the base-line offset,C 1,0 is the monomer concentration at the reference radius r0 , N is the stoichiometry of the reaction, and KN is the equilibrium association constant. ς is defined as follows, ς=M1(1−ν¯ρ)ω2/2RTEquation 2 where M 1 is the monomer molecular weight,ν̄ is the partial specific volume, ρ is the solvent density, ω is the angular velocity of the rotor, R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature of the sedimentation equilibrium experiment. Global molecular weights were obtained for several rotor speeds and protein concentrations by fitting the equilibrium sedimentation data to a single species using the equations above. Sedimentation velocity experiments were carried out at 60,000 rpm at 20 °C for sample concentrations of 0.18, 1.1, and 1.3 mg/ml. Protein and buffer samples were prepared as described above. Two-sector charcoal-filled epon 12-mm centerpieces with quartz windows were loaded with 420 μl of protein in the sample well and 426 μl of buffer in the reference well. Radial scans at 230 or 280 nm were collected with a step size of 0.003 cm in continuous mode at intervals of about 4 min for a period of 4 h. Sedimentation coefficients corrected for diffusion were calculated for each boundary by the method of van Holde and Weischet (34.van Holde K.E. Weischet W.O. Biopolymers. 1975; 17: 1387-1403Crossref Scopus (318) Google Scholar) using the program Ultrascan II (B. Demeler, University of Texas Health Sciences Center at San Antonio). Thes 20,w for each protein concentration was determined at the boundary midpoint from a plot of the boundary fraction versus S 20,w. Values ofs 20,w at three different protein concentrations did not show evidence of concentration dependence when extrapolated to infinite dilution. Thus, the s20,w0 of 2.24 ± 0.01 S was obtained by averaging the three sedimentation coefficients. The translational frictional coefficient, f, was calculated from the Svedberg equation, f=M(1−ν¯ρ)NAsEquation 3 where ν̄ is the partial specific volume, ρ is the solvent density, M is the molecular weight,N A is Avogadro's number, and s is the sedimentation coefficient. The frictional coefficient for a rigid spherical molecule of equal (anhydrous) volume,f o, was calculated from Stokes law,f o = 6πηR o where η is the buffer viscosity and Ro is the radius of the molecule. Based on the frictional coefficient and an estimated value for hydration from the amino acid composition (δ = 0.4244) (32.Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.M. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, London1992: 90-125Google Scholar), axial ratios for simple ellipsoidal and cylindrical models were estimated using SEDNTERP. Assays of the Tup1-Ssn6 interaction were performed on a Biacore system with certified nitrilotriacetic acid sensor chips. Flow cells were coated with nickel as described by the manufacturer. Immobilization of the His-3TPR Ssn6 and of the His-AraC (control) fragments was performed as follows. A continuous flow of running buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8) and 150 mm NaCl) over the sensor surface at 10 μl/min was maintained and between 60 and 150 μl of HisTag fragments (200 nm in 50 mm Tris (pH 8) and 50 mmNaCl) were injected at 3 μl/min. The relative amount of protein immobilized ranged from 250 to 400 response units. Binding of the N-terminal Tup1 fragments to the immobilized Ssn6 3 TPR protein was monitored by injecting 20 μl of Tup1 at increasing concentrations (2–20 μm) over the chip surface at a flow rate of 10 μl/min at 25 °C. After 15 min of dissociation, the surface was regenerated. Interaction curves were obtained by subtracting the experimental curves from the control. Data were analyzed using the Langmuir model functions provided in the Biacore Biaevaluation 3.0 software package. According to this model, data were evaluated using the following rate equation, dR/dt=kaC(Rmax−Rt)−kdRtEquation 4 assuming a single site interaction between the Ssn6 3 TPR protein and each N-terminal Tup1 tetramer, wheredR/dt is the rate of formation of surface complexes, C is the concentration of N-terminal Tup1 tetramer, R max is the total amount of immobilized ligand expressed as surface plasmon resonance response,Rt is the response observed at timet. ka and kd are the association and dissociation rate constants, respectively. The equilibrium dissociation constant, KD , was calculated from the ratiokd /ka . The fit of the data to the model was assessed by examining the residuals and by minimizing the χ2 values. CD spectra of the N-terminal Tup1 fragments were measured at 20 °C in a AVIV DS 60 spectrometer with a quartz cell of 0.1-mm path length. The protein concentration was 1 mg/ml in 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7). Molar ellipticity was calculated as described by Delage and Geourjon (35.Delage G. Geourjon C. Comp. Appl. Biosci. 1993; 9: 197-199PubMed Google Scholar). Estimates of the secondary structure were made using the CDNN program (36.Andrade M.A. Chacon P. Merelo J.J. Moran F. Protein Eng. 1993; 4: 383-390Crossref Scopus (949) Google Scholar, 37.Bohm G. Muhr R. Jaenicke R. Protein Eng. 1992; 3: 191-195Crossref Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). The Sc N91 Tup1 fragment was concentrated to 1 mm in 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7). The 1H nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy spectrum was collected with Brucker DMX 600 MHz at 25 °C in 90% H2O − 10% D2O. The spectrum was processed with NMRPipe (38.Delaglio F. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11555) Google Scholar). Crystals of the N-terminal domain of Tup1 were grown by the method of hanging drop vapor diffusion from protein purified and concentrated as described above. Protein was mixed on a siliconized coverslip with an equal volume of well solution containing 12% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 100 mm Bis-Tris propane (pH 9), and 1 mmdithiothreitol and suspended over the well solution, after which crystals appeared in 1–2 weeks. Crystals of dimension 600 × 400 × 50 μm were mounted and sealed in a glass capillary. X-ray diffraction was recorded at room temperature with an RAXIS II image plate detector equipped with Osmic double-focusing mirrors using copper Kα radiation generated by a Rigaku RU-200 rotating anode x-ray generator. Unit cell and fiber diffraction parameters were measured directly from diffraction images using the program IPDISP (54.Collaborative Computational Project, November 4Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19762) Google Scholar). Comparison of several fungal Tup1 proteins reveals the presence of a conserved 10-kDa N-terminal domain containing residues that have been found to mediate tetramerization ofS. cerevisiae Tup1 (12.Varanasi U.S. Klis M. Mikesell P.B. Trumbly R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6707-6714Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 20.Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Nature. 1994; 369: 758-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) and interaction with Ssn6 (20.Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Nature. 1994; 369: 758-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The corresponding domain of S. cerevisiae Tup1 containing residues 1–91 (Sc N91 Tup1) was expressed and purified, and its oligomeric state was assayed by sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation. Typical data collected at one initial loading concentration and at three different speeds are shown in Fig.1 A. These data, as well as additional data collected at different initial loading concentrations (data not shown), were well described by a model for a single homogeneous species (“Experimental Procedures,” Equation 1) as evaluated by randomness of the residuals and minimization of the variance (Fig. 1 A). The single species model yielded an average molecular mass of 43,000 Da ± 1500, which compared with the calculated monomer molecular mass of 11,088 Da, strongly suggests that Sc N91 Tup1 self-associates as a tetramer. To examine whether monomer, dimer, or octamer species were also present, the data were also fit to models describing monomer-dimer-tetramer, monomer-tetramer, and monomer-tetramer-octamer equilibria. Attempts to fit the data to each of these models were unsuccessful as reflected in increased variances as well as unrealistic values for equilibrium constants. We therefore conclude that the tetramer is the predominant species of Sc N91 Tup1 and that this tetramer is not in a detectable reversible equilibrium with other species. Carrico and Zitomer (39.Carrico P.M. Zitomer R.S. Genetics. 1998; 148: 637-644PubMed Google Scholar) identified a Tup1 mutant protein with leucine 62 replaced by an arginine, L62R, which is unable to form a complex with Ssn6 or to repress expression of hypoxic and glucose-repressed reporter genes. Repression of the a-mating type reporter gene, however, is unaffected by this substitution. To better understand the effects of this mutation, we used equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation to examine whether the mutation Leu-62 → Arg impairs the ability of Sc N91 Tup1 to form a tetramer. Data collected for one loading concentration of Sc mut62 Tup1 at three different speeds are shown in Fig. 1 B. These data with additional data at two other loading concentrations (data not shown) fit best to a model with a single species of molecular mass 40,000 ± 1000 Da. Because the calculated monomer molecular mass of Sc mut62 Tup1 is 11,131 Da, the predominant oligomeric state of Sc mut62 Tup1 is a tetramer, as was observed for the wild-type fragment. In light of the 4500 Da difference between the observed molecular mass and the theoretical one, it is possible that some monomer or dimer states are also present in solution. However, attempts to fit the data to monomer-dimer-tetramer, monomer-tetramer, or dimer-tetramer models were unsuccessful, as shown again by increased variances and unrealistic values for equilibrium constants. These results show that the tetramerization of the N-terminal domain of Tup1 is very stable and is not in a reversible equilibrium with lower oligomeric states. They also demonstrate that the mutation L62R, which weakens the interaction with Ssn6, does not notably impair the tetramerization of Tup1. A surface plasmon resonance-based biosensor assay was used to carry out a kinetic analysis of the Tup1-Ssn6 interaction. The protein fragments assayed were those that had been previously shown to be the minimal domains required for the two proteins to bind to one another (11.Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 821-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 20.Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Nature. 1994; 369: 758-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). An Ssn6 fragment consisting of the first three TPR motifs (residues 31–149) and preceded by an N-terminal His tag was immobilized on a Ni2+-coated biosensor chip surface (see “Experimental Procedures”). The binding of the Tup1 protein to the surface of the chip and its subsequent dissociation were monitored by surface plasmon resonance, which yields a signal proportional to the mass detected. The sensorgram in Fig. 2 A shows the binding of the Sc N91 Tup1 fragment to the immobilized Ssn6 3 TPR fragment. As a control for the specificity of the interaction, this was compared with the binding of Tup1 to a surface coupled with the N-terminal domain of the E. coli AraC protein fused to a His tag (Fig. 2 A) and to a Ni2+-coated surface lacking immobilized protein (Fig. 2 A). Binding of Tup1 to either surface was negligible. Furthermore, a Tup1 fragment containing the WD region of the protein but lacking the N-terminal residues that interact with Ssn6 (Sc WD Tup1), did not bind to the immobilized Ssn6 3TPR fragment, even at high concentrations (Fig. 2 B). Binding of Sc N91 Tup1 to the immobilized Ssn6 3 TPR fragment was studied over a Sc N91 Tup1 concentration range of 2–15 μm. Fig. 3 Ashows representative sensorgrams of association and dissociation at various Sc N91 Tup1 concentrations. These data were analyzed by simultaneous global fitting of both association and dissociation phases for all sets of concentrations, using the model AB 219 A+B and assuming a single site interaction between a Tup1 tetramer and Ssn6 (“Experimental Procedures,” Equation 1). The best fit was achieved by considering the first three minutes of the dissociation (χ2 = 17.5, Table I). According to this fit, the dissociation rate,kd , was equal to 8 × 10−4s−1, and"

VHL engages in a nucleocytoplasmic shuttle, which is required for its function. Here, we pursue our investigation to identify mechanisms by which VHL-green fluorescent protein (VHL-GFP) is exported from the nucleus. We show that nuclear export of VHL-GFP in living cells requires ongoing RNA polymerase II activity, and is mediated by mechanisms that are temperature-sensitive and energy-dependent. In vitro nuclear export of VHL-GFP is inhibited by nuclear pore-specific lectins, requires ATP hydrolysis and polyadenylated mRNAs, and occurs with kinetics that are similar to those of proteins containing a nuclear export signal. Biochemical fractionation has revealed that nuclear export of VHL-GFP occurs by way of a Ran-dependent pathway. Size exclusion column chromatography and deletion mutant analysis suggest that VHL-GFP does not require assembly with one of its associated proteins, cullin-2, to engage in nuclear export. These results demonstrate that nuclear export of VHL-GFP is Ran-mediated and ATP hydrolysis-dependent. They also suggest that sequences outside the elongin C binding box may function as a nuclear export domain, potentially providing a novel role for this region of VHL frequently mutated in renal cell carcinoma.

VHL patients develop a wide variety of tumors including retinal angioma, central nervous system hemangioblastoma, pheochromocytoma, and renal clear cell carcinoma (RCC). Biallelic VHL gene defects are also found in the sporadic form of these tumors, including RCC, the most common type of kidney cancer in human (4.Foster K. Prowse A. van den Berg A. Fleming S.

In addition, the reintroduction of VHL in VHL-negative RCC restored their ability to regulate levels of hypoxia-inducible mRNAs (10.Gnarra J.R. Zhou S. Merrill M.J. Wagner J.R. Krumm A.

The VHL mRNA produces two proteins from alternative in-frame methionines of 213 and 160 amino acids that do not share sequence similarity with other proteins, thus giving no clues as to their functions (both forms will be referred to as “VHL”) (16.Blankenship C Naglich J.G.

VHL assembles into a core heterotetrameric complex with three other associated proteins: elongin B, elongin C, and cullin-2 (VBC/Cul-2) (12.Lonergan K.M. Iliopoulos O. Ohh M. Kamura T. Conaway R.C.

Structural similarity between elongin C and cullin-2 with two components of a yeast E3-ubiquitin ligase complex, SKP1 and CDC53, respectively, has led to the suggestion that VBC/Cul-2 may play a role in protein ubiquitination (20.Kibel A.

Skowyra D. Moreland R.J. Iliopoulos O. Lane W.S. Kaelin W.G. Elledge S.J. Conaway R.C. Harper J.W. Conaway J.W.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1822-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). One potential target of VBC/Cul-2-mediated degradation is the hypoxia-inducible factor-α subunit, a protein involved in the regulation of several hypoxia-inducible mRNAs (25.Maxwell P.H.

Disruption of VBC/Cul-2 by tumor-derived mutations results in the abnormal stabilization, and accumulation, of vascular endothelial growth factor, Glut-1, and transforming growth factor-α mRNAs, suggesting a role for the complex in the processing of these transcripts (12.Lonergan K.M.

Another intriguing characteristic of VHL is that it is able to localize to the nucleus and the cytoplasm, and shuttle between these two compartments (9.Iliopoulos O. Kibel A. Gray S. Kaelin W.G. Nat.

Cancer. 1998; 78: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). VHL shuttling is sensitive to ongoing RNA polymerase II activity, but is not affected by treatment with leptomycin B, a drug that affects CRM1-mediated nuclear export of protein containing a classical, leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES; Refs. 33.Nishi K. Yoshida M. Fujiwara D. Nishikawa M. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6320-6324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 34.Wolff B. Sanglier J.J. Wang Y. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 139-147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Likewise, VHL was unable to function as a negative regulator of Glut-1 levels when it was fused to a classical NES and induced to shuttle in a leptomycin B-sensitive, but transcription-insensitive, manner (29.Lee S. Neumann M. Stearman R. Stauber R. Pause A. Pavlakis G.N. Klausner R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1486-1497Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggested that VHL might export from the nucleus through a yet undescribed pathway. Therefore, we decided to pursue our studies on VHL subcellular trafficking by investigating the mechanisms involved in its regulated nuclear export. We show that VHL nuclear export occurs through a Ran-mediated and ATP hydrolysis-dependent pathway. VHL exports from the nucleus bound to complexes containing cullin-2, but appears to be able to mediate its own nuclear export and that of an inert green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter. These results provide evidence that VHL contains a nuclear export domain, which might play a role in nuclear export of the VBC/Cul-2 complex. The 786-0 (VHL-negative) and HeLa cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). The VHL-GFP cell line corresponds to a 786-0 stably transfected with the VHL-GFP fusion protein as described elsewhere (29.Lee S. Neumann M. Stearman R. Stauber R. Pause A. Pavlakis G.N. Klausner R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1486-1497Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum in a 37 °C, humidified, 5% CO2-containing-atmosphere incubator. Transient transfections of HeLa cells were performed overnight using a standard calcium phosphate method. The human VHL cDNA, which codes for a 213-amino acid VHL protein, was subcloned into pcDNA3.1(−) (Invitrogen) vector. A Flag epitope tag (DYKDDDDK) was added to the N terminus of the VHL cDNA open reading frame. A cDNA coding for an enhanced fluorescence version of the GFP (Fred25; Ref. 35.Stauber R. Gaitanaris G.A. Pavlakis G.N. Virology. 1995; 213: 439-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) was subcloned at the C terminus VHL to produce the VHL-GFP fusion protein. A deletion mutant of the last 56 amino acids was also fused to GFP to produce the ΔC157-GFP fusion protein. The VHL moiety was also replaced by a full-length cullin-2 cDNA (21.Pause A. Lee S. Worrell R.A. Chen D.Y.T. Burgess W.H. Linehan W.M. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2156-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar) to produce cullin-2-GFP. The open reading frame of chicken pyruvate kinase (PK) fused to GFP (PK-GFP), and two GFP in tandem (GFP-GFP), were cloned into pcDNA3.1(−). The NLS fusion proteins were produced by fusing the strong NLS of simian virus 40 (SV40; Ref. 36.Kalderon D. Roberts B.L. Richardson W.D. Smith A.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 499-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1843) Google Scholar) large T antigen (PKKKRKKV; NLS) to the C terminus of GFP. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The nuclear export assay was essentially as described (37.Melchior F. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 88: 265-273PubMed Google Scholar, 38.Melchior F. Paschal B. Evans J. Gerace L. J.

Cells were grown to confluence, washed with PBS and incubated 1 min in the presence of transport buffer containing 20 mm HEPES pH 7.3, 110 mm KOAc, 5 mm NaOAc, 2 mmMg(OAc)2, 1 mm EGTA, and 2 mm DTT. The cells were permeabilized at 4 °C for 5 min in the presence of transport buffer containing 50 μg/ml digitonin and a protease inhibitor mixture including 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin. Cells were washed several times with transport buffer and protease inhibitor mixture for 15 min at 4 °C. Cells were incubated for the indicated time, generally 30–45 min, at 20 °C in the presence of the standard reaction mixture that included transport buffer, HeLa cytosol, 2 mm ATP, 2 mm GTP, and an ATP-regenerating system (5 mm creatine phosphate and 20 units/ml creatine phosphokinase). Where indicated, ATP and GTP were omitted or replaced with AMP-PNP and GMP-PNP at 2 mm, respectively. Wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) was added, as indicated, at a concentration of 200 μg/ml. The overall volume of the reaction mixture was 0.5–1 ml. For the preincubation experiments, permeabilized cells were incubated 15 min at 4 °C in the presence of transport buffer, followed by an incubation of 30 min at 20 °C in the presence of transport buffer and 2 mm ATP, 2 mm GTP, and an ATP-regenerating system before the addition of the standard reaction mixture. Reactions were stopped by washing the cells several times with ice-cold transport buffer. For biochemical analysis of export, cells were trypsinized, washed in PBS, permeabilized in the presence of transport buffer with 50 μg/ml digitonin for 5 min at 4 °C supplemented with the protease inhibitor mixture, and subsequently washed several times with cold transport buffer for 15 min at 4 °C. Nuclei were aliquoted in 1.5-ml tubes and treated as described above. Export was terminated by centrifugation at 300 × g at 4 °C for 2 min to separate nuclei from the supernatant. Nuclei were lysed in the presence of 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 137 mm NaCl with protease mixture for 30 min at 4 °C, or with 4% SDS in PBS. 4× SDS-sample buffer was added to aliquots of nuclear lysates and supernatant, which were separated on SDS-PAGE, and blotted onto nitrocellulose using standard methods. Blots were blocked with 5% milk powder in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, incubated with the indicated antibodies at a concentration of 1 μg/ml for 16 h at 4 °C, washed, and incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-coupled donkey anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibody (1:5000) for 60 min at room temperature. The enhanced chemiluminescence system was used to detect signal (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Blots were also incubated with other antibodies; an anti-p27 antibody at 1:1000 (Transduction Laboratories) and an anti-cyclin B antibody at 1:1000 (Santa Cruz) and a rabbit anti-cullin-2 antibody at 1:5000. Nuclear GFP fluorescence images were captured using a Zeiss Axiovert S100TV microscope with a C-Apochromat 40× water immersion objective, equipped with an Empix digital charge-coupled device (CCD) camera using Northern Eclipse software. Images were manipulated with Northern Eclipse, NIH Image, and Adobe Photoshop software as described elsewhere (29.Lee S. Neumann M. Stearman R. Stauber R. Pause A. Pavlakis G.N. Klausner R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1486-1497Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, relative nuclear signals were measured as followed. Images were obtained with identical integration time, usually 0.5–3 s at a 2 by 2 binning with an electronic gain of 2. Images were always taken under nonsaturating conditions. Three random images containing between 30 and 45 independent nuclei, which could be observed with Hoechst staining, were captured within 30–45 s. GFP images were always taken before the Hoechst images to minimize any possible bleaching effect. Hoechst positive regions were used to identify and measure GFP signal in the different nuclei. Reactions were standardized using an arbitrary value of 100%, which corresponded to signal obtained immediately after the 15-min washing step at 4 °C. Approximately 90% of nuclei were positive for GFP signal over background, whereas 10% of nuclei showed either weak or no fluorescence signal. Values were average from three independent experiments, always using a new 100% standard in each experiment. For the time lapse imaging, images were captured as described above but with one main difference to eliminate bleaching that occurs during the repeated exposure to 488 nm light. Bleaching was measured at ∼ 2% per picture and taken into account for quantification. One ml of HeLa cytosol was loaded on a Superdex S-200 column equilibrated with 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.3) and 10 mm NaCl using a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min and collecting 25 fractions of 0.5 ml. Half of each other fractions were added to ATP/GTP and an ATP regeneration system to test for nuclear export of VHL-GFP. Aliquots of 50 μl of some of the fractions were also separated on SDS-PAGE, blotted on nitrocellulose, and incubated in the presence of anti-Ran antibody (Transduction Laboratories). Recombinant Ran and RanG19V were a kind gift from Dr. Mary Dasso (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) and added to the export reaction at a concentration of 100 μg/ml. For experiments shown in Fig. 5, Ran was produced as described (41.Michael W.M. Eder P.S. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3587-3598Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Briefly, bacteria expressing Ran were pelleted and resuspended in 1/20 volume of transport buffer and a mixture of protease inhibitor. The bacterial suspension was lysed by sonication, and the lysate was centrifuged at maximum speed in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge for 30 min. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 80,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was either used directly or diluted 1:1 in transport buffer immediately before using in transport reaction. Higher dilution of the lysate resulted in a marked loss of nuclear export of VHL-GFP. Bacterial lysate alone did not support VHL-GFP nuclear export in vitro (see Fig. 3 A).Figure 3Identification of the small GTPase Ran as the major activity in HeLa cytosolic extract that stimulates in vitro nuclear export of VHL-GFP. A, cytosolic factor requirement for VHL-GFP nuclear export in vitro. Digitonin permeabilized 786-0 cells expressing VHL-GFP were incubated for 30 min at 20 °C in the presence of transport buffer supplemented with 2 mm each ATP/GTP, an ATP regeneration system and either with 2 mg/ml (+lysate) or without (−lysate) HeLa cytosolic extract, or with 2 mg/ml each of extract from 786-0 RCC cells (+kidney lysate), Cos-7 cells, mouse NIH 3T3 cells, and E. coli cells. Quantitative analysis is shown. B, profile of VHL-GFP nuclear export activity of fractions collected from a Superdex-200 column. Twenty-five fractions of ∼0.5 ml were collected at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. Reaction mixtures contained transport buffer, 2 mm each ATP/GTP, an ATP regeneration system, and 20% of each other fractions. Molecular sizes (MW) for fractions represent values obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and are based on the flow rate. VHL-GFP nuclear export was measured semiquantitatively on 14 of the 25 fractions in comparison with 4 °C transport buffer control and scored as: −, no or only slight export; +/−, detectable export; and ++, export levels similar to those obtained with HeLa extract. An aliquot of 50 μl of each fraction was separated on SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and incubated with an anti-Ran antibody. Ran migrates at about 25 kDa and eluted from the Superdex-200 column in the 10–60-kDa range, although longer exposure revealed the presence of Ran in fractions 5–12. C, effect of purified recombinant Ran on VHL-GFP in vitronuclear export. VHL-GFP-expressing 786-0 cells were permeabilized with digitonin and incubated for 30 min with transport buffer, 2 mm each ATP/GTP, an ATP regeneration system, and either without (−Ran, a) or with 100 μg/ml Ran (+Ran, b) at 20 °C or with Ran but at 4 °C (+Ran, 4 °C, c). D, biochemical analysis of Ran-dependent VHL-GFP nuclear export in vitro. 786-0 cells expressing VHL-GFP were trypsinized, washed in PBS, and permeabilized with digitonin. Nuclei were incubated at 20 °C with transport buffer containing 2 mm ATP/GTP, an ATP regeneration system without (−Ran) or with (+Ran) 100 μg/ml recombinant Ran. Reaction time was either 0 or 30 min, as indicated. Nuclei were collected by centrifugation and separated from the supernatant fraction. Equal aliquots of nuclear (N) and supernatant (S) fractions were separated on SDS-PAGE. Blots were incubated with an anti-FLAG M2 antibody, to detect VHL-GFP. E, effect of Ran on VHL-GFP nuclear export after 30-min preincubation of permeabilized cells with ATP/GTP. Permeabilized cells were washed for the standard 15 min at 4 °C and then incubated for another 30 min at 20 °C in transport buffer containing 2 mm ATP/GTP and an ATP regeneration system. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold transport buffer and incubated for 30 min at 20 °C in transport buffer, 2 mm ATP/GTP, an ATP regeneration system, and either without (−Ran,a) or with (+Ran, b) at 100 μg/ml.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have previously reported that nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of VHL-GFP is insensitive to leptomycin B treatment raising the possibility that nuclear export of VHL-GFP occurs through a CRM-1-independent pathway (29.Lee S. Neumann M. Stearman R. Stauber R. Pause A. Pavlakis G.N. Klausner R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1486-1497Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it was unclear if nuclear export of VHL-GFP was the outcome of simple passive diffusion through the nuclear pore complex or if it required energy-dependent mechanisms. The dependence on NTP hydrolysis would suggest that VHL-GFP might utilize a specific, transporter-mediated nuclear export pathway (42.Nigg E.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). Two independent strategies were developed to test if energy is required for nuclear export of VHL-GFP in living cells. First, transiently transfected HeLa cells were incubated in the presence of the RNA polymerase II inhibitor DRB, which induced VHL-GFP to change its steady state distribution from cytoplasmic to mainly nuclear (Fig.1 A, a andb; see also Ref. 29.Lee S. Neumann M. Stearman R. Stauber R. Pause A. Pavlakis G.N. Klausner R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1486-1497Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reactivation of RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription, by washing away DRB, caused VHL-GFP to reestablish a predominately cytoplasmic distribution (Fig.1 A, c) without any changes in level of fluorescence (data not shown and Ref. 29.Lee S. Neumann M. Stearman R. Stauber R. Pause A. Pavlakis G.N. Klausner R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1486-1497Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As these experiments are performed in the presence of cycloheximide, the return of VHL-GFP to the cytoplasm can only be explained by the ability of existing molecules to export from the nucleus. The redistribution of VHL-GFP to the cytoplasm is inhibited when cells are incubated at 4 °C or in the presence of metabolic poisons (Fig. 1 A, d ande), suggesting that nuclear export of VHL-GFP is an energy-dependent process. The ability of the VHL-GFP fusion protein to export from the nucleus is mediated by the VHL moiety, since replacing it by another GFP (GFP-GFP) resulted in a fusion protein whose localization was unaffected by DRB or metabolic poisons (data not shown; Ref. 35.Stauber R. Gaitanaris G.A. Pavlakis G.N. Virology. 1995; 213: 439-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The second approach consisted of a strategy by which VHL-GFP was forced to localize exclusively to the nucleus by way of its fusion to the strong, temperature-sensitive, and energy-dependent SV40 nuclear import signal (VHL-GFP-NLS; Fig. 1, B and C (a); Ref. 36.Kalderon D. Roberts B.L. Richardson W.D. Smith A.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 499-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1843) Google Scholar). We reasoned that VHL-GFP-NLS would accumulate in the cytoplasm upon incubation of cells at 4 °C, or in the presence of metabolic poisons, since the fusion protein would fail to reimport in these conditions. VHL-GFP-NLS localized exclusively in the nucleus even in conditions where NLS activity was inhibited (Fig. 1 C,b and c), suggesting that it is unable to passively diffuse out of the nucleus. The VHL moiety was replaced by another GFP to produce the GFP-GFP-NLS fusion protein whose mass and nuclear localization were similar to that of VHL-GFP-NLS (60 kDa; Fig.1, B and C (d)). In contrast to VHL-GFP-NLS, GFP-GFP"
https://openalex.org/W2040738425,"We found that antitumor drugs such as cytotrienin A, camptothecin, taxol, and 5-fluorouracil induced the activation of a 36-kDa protein kinase (p36 myelin basic protein (MBP) kinase) during apoptosis in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells. This p36 MBP kinase, which phosphorylates MBP in an in-gel kinase assay, results from the caspase-3-mediated proteolytic cleavage of MST/Krs protein, a mammalian Ste20-like serine/threonine kinase. Herein the correlation between cytotrienin A-induced apoptosis and the activation of MST/Krs proteins was examined in human tumor cell lines, including leukemia-, lung-, epidermoid-, cervix-, stomach-, and brain-derived cell lines. In cytotrienin A-sensitive cell lines, we observed a strong activation of p36 MBP kinase by cleavage of the C-terminal regulatory domain of full-length MST/Krs proteins by caspase-3. When the kinase-inactive mutant form of MST/Krs protein was overexpressed in cytotrienin A-sensitive HL-60 cells, the cytotrienin A-induced apoptosis was partially inhibited. Because cytotrienin A also activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase, we examined the effect of the expression of dominant negative c-Jun on cytotrienin A-induced apoptosis. The expression of dominant negative c-Jun also partially inhibited cytotrienin A-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, coexpression of kinase-inactive MST/Krs protein and dominant negative c-Jun completely suppressed cytotrienin A-induced apoptosis. These findings suggest that the proteolytic activation of MST/Krs and c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation are involved in cytotrienin A-induced apoptosis in human tumor cell lines.

Pathol. 1991; 32: 223-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar). It is morphologically distinct from necrosis in many of its characteristic changes as follows: DNA fragmentation, chromatin condensation, membrane blebbing, and cell shrinkage. Antitumor agents also induce apoptosis in some cancer cells both in vitro andin vivo, indicating that apoptosis plays a very important role in cancer chemotherapy (3.Kaufmann S.H. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5870-5878PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Meyn R.E. Stephens L.C. Hunter N.R. Milas L. Anti-Cancer Drugs. 1995; 6: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, the biochemical mechanism of apoptosis induction by antitumor agents is not yet fully understood.Previous studies indicate that the apoptotic process is triggered by the activation of a caspase cascade (1.Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4536) Google Scholar, 5.Nicholson D.W. Thornbery N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2175) Google Scholar). Caspases are a family of cysteine proteases expressed ubiquitously in multicellular organisms as latent pro-enzyme forms. Activation of pro-caspases is an obligatory step in the execution of apoptosis, and this activation takes place by proteolytic cleavage. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, three apoptosis-related genes have been cloned,ced-3, ced-4, and ced-9 (6.Hengartner M.O. Horvitz H.R. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1994; 4: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The former two genes are required for execution of the death program, whereas ced-9 prevents cell death. Mammalian homologues of Ced-3 and Ced-9 proteins have been identified as the interleukin-1β-converting enzyme cysteine protease (termed caspase-1) and Bcl-2, respectively (7.Yuan J. Shaham S. Ledoux S. Ellis H.M. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1993; 75: 641-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2233) Google Scholar, 8.Hengartner M.O. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 665-676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). The Ced-4 protein is homologous to the human protein Apaf-1, which participates in the activation of caspase-3 (9.Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2726) Google Scholar, 10.Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar). Caspase-3, an important effector caspase, is responsible for the cleavage of crucial substrates such as structural proteins, signaling proteins, and transcription-regulating proteins involved in the apoptotic process (1.Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4536) Google Scholar, 5.Nicholson D.W. Thornbery N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2175) Google Scholar). In particular, the fact that caspases regulate the activity of several protein kinases indicates that protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation mechanisms may play an important role in the initiation and progression of apoptosis. However, the role of individual targets in the common apoptotic signaling pathway triggered by anticancer agents is still uncertain.Cytotrienin A (Fig. 1), a novel ansamycin antitumor agent, was isolated from Streptomyces sp. as an apoptosis inducer (11.Kakeya H. Zhang H.-P. Kobinata K. Onose R. Onozawa C. Kudo T. Osada H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1997; 50: 370-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 12.Zhang H.-P. Kakeya H. Osada H. Tetrahedron Lett. 1997; 38: 1789-1792Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Recently, we have found that JNK1 and a 36-kDa kinase (termed p36 MBP kinase) are activated during the cytotrienin A-induced apoptosis in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells (13.Kakeya H. Onose R. Osada H. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4888-4894PubMed Google Scholar). This p36 MBP kinase is an active proteolytic product of the MST2/Krs1 and MST1/Krs2 protein kinases and were originally cloned by virtue of their homology to the budding yeast Ste20 kinase (13.Kakeya H. Onose R. Osada H. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4888-4894PubMed Google Scholar). Two other groups (14.Graves J.D. Gotoh Y. Draves K.E. Ambrose D. Han D.K.M. Wright M. Chernoff J. Clark E.A. Krebs E.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2224-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar,15.Lee K.-K. Murakawa M. Nishida E. Tsubuki S. Kawashima S.-I. Sakamaki K. Yonehara S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3029-3037Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) have also reported that MST1/Krs2 is cleaved by a caspase-3-like activity during Fas-induced apoptosis. Notably, Graves et al. (14.Graves J.D. Gotoh Y. Draves K.E. Ambrose D. Han D.K.M. Wright M. Chernoff J. Clark E.A. Krebs E.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2224-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) extensively examined the involvement of MST1/Krs2 together with mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade during apoptosis. It is possible that most apoptotic signals including the Fas-mediated signal and the cytotrienin-induced signal activate several pathways for apoptosis in a target cell. Unlike these apoptosis inducers, MT-21 (3-acetyl-4,5-dimethyl-5-octyloxy-3-pyrrolin-2-one), our synthetic apoptosis inducer, activates the signal from caspase-3, MST/Krs to JNK in a rather simple manner (16.Kakeya H. Onozawa C. Sato M. Arai K. Osada H. J. Med. Chem. 1997; 40: 391-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 17.Watabe M. Kakeya H. Osada H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5211-5220Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have investigated the caspase-mediated proteolytic activation of MST/Krs proteins in cytotrienin A-sensitive and -resistant human tumor cell lines.DISCUSSIONIn our previous studies (11.Kakeya H. Zhang H.-P. Kobinata K. Onose R. Onozawa C. Kudo T. Osada H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1997; 50: 370-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 12.Zhang H.-P. Kakeya H. Osada H. Tetrahedron Lett. 1997; 38: 1789-1792Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we identified a novel anticancer drug, named cytotrienin A, which is an ansamycin with a unique 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid in the molecule. Moreover, cytotrienin A induces apoptosis in human leukemia HL-60 cells via activation of p36 MBP kinase, an active proteolytic fragment of MST/Krs proteins (13.Kakeya H. Onose R. Osada H. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4888-4894PubMed Google Scholar). The MST/Krs proteins are Ste20-related protein kinases and are classified in the germinal center kinase subfamily (20.Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 162-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The germinal center kinase subfamily of p21-activated protein kinase-like kinases, which play regulatory roles in diverse cellular phenomena such as morphogenesis, stress-response, and proliferation, comprises at least 9 distinct members (germinal center kinase, HPK1, NIK, MST1/Krs2, MST2/Krs1, KHS, SOK1, Sps1p, and Nrk1p) (20.Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 162-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Very little is known about the regulation and function of these kinases, including the MST/Krs proteins. All of the antitumor agents that were used in the present study induced the activation of the MST/Krs proteins and DNA fragmentation in HL-60 cells (Fig. 2). As MST/Krs proteins might be a general component of apoptosis induction by antitumor agents, we investigated the relationship between the expression and proteolytic activation of MST/Krs proteins in response to anticancer agents, including cytotrienin A, in various human tumor cell lines.In HL-60 and Jurkat cells, which are highly sensitive to cytotrienin A, robust expression and proteolytic activation of MST/Krs proteins by caspase-3 were observed (Table I and Figs. 3 and 4). In contrast, cytotrienin A-resistant cell lines such as WI-38, A549, A431, HeLa, SH-SY5Y, and SMS-KCN expressed a very low amount of MST/Krs proteins, and there was no detectable proteolytic activation of MST/Krs proteins (Table I and Figs. 3 and 4). These effects of cytotrienin A are not dependent on the doubling time of each tumor cell line (data not shown). Although MKN74 cells expressed high levels of MST2/Krs1 and showed resistance to cytotrienin A treatment, there was no detectable proteolytic activation of MST/Krs by caspases (Fig. 3 B). K562 cells are also cytotrienin A-sensitive, but no activation of p36 MBP kinase was induced by cytotrienin A-treatment. K562 cells possess a Philadelphia chromosome with a translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 that generates the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase by the fusion of Bcr sequences upstream of the second exon of c-Abl. Bcr-Abl is known to inhibit chemotherapeutic drug-induced apoptosis (18.Amarante-Mendes G.P. McGahon A.J. Nishioka W.K. Afar D.EH Witte N.O. Green D.R. Oncogene. 1996; 16: 1383-1390Crossref Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Considering this, it may be possible that Bcr-Abl acts as an inhibitor of the signal that activates MST/Krs proteins and that there is a different signal for cytotrienin A-induced apoptosis not affected by Bcr-Abl. These results suggest that the proteolytic activation of MST/Krs proteins rather than expression level might correlate with apoptosis. There appears to be no correlation between the expression level of crucial components of the apoptotic program such as caspase-3, Bcl-2, and Bax (1.Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4536) Google Scholar, 21.Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar, 22.Chresta C.M. Masters J.R.W. Hickman J.A. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1834-1841PubMed Google Scholar) and the cytotrienin A sensitivity of the tested human tumor cell lines. To date, we have only examined the expression and activation of MST/Krs proteins in a limited number of cell lines in response to a small number of antitumor agents. A more systematic analysis of the expression and the activation of MST/Krs proteins should be helpful in studies aimed at finding new antitumor agents and testing the sensitivity of antitumor agents in human tumor cells.MST/Krs proteins consist of two family members, MST2/Krs1 and MST1/Krs2. Both proteins undergo caspase-mediated cleavage during apoptosis. MST2/Krs1 and MST/Krs2 possess consensus recognition sites for caspase-3, 319DELD322S and323DEMD326S, respectively (13.Kakeya H. Onose R. Osada H. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4888-4894PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Graves J.D. Gotoh Y. Draves K.E. Ambrose D. Han D.K.M. Wright M. Chernoff J. Clark E.A. Krebs E.G.

As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, a synthetic inhibitor of caspase-3, Z-Asp-CH2-DCB, blocked proteolytic activation of both MST2/Krs1 and MST1/Krs2 proteins in cytotrienin A-sensitive human tumor cell lines, indicating that caspase-3 activation is necessary for the activation of p36 MBP kinase. In addition, we have shown that in both HL-60 and Jurkat cells, ROS induced by treatment with cytotrienin A play an important role in the caspase-mediated activation of p36 MBP kinase (Fig. 4, A andB). These results indicate that MST/Krs proteins are responsive to oxidative stress. Apoptosis induced by MT-21, a synthetic apoptosis inducer, is also blocked by N-acetylcysteine, a radical scavenger (17.Watabe M. Kakeya H. Osada H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5211-5220Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), supporting our present studies. SOK-1, another germinal center kinase family member, is directly activated via autophosphorylation triggered by ROS, but the kinase is not activated by growth factors, alkylating agents, cytokines, or environmental stresses such as heat shock and osmotic stress (26.Pombo C.M. Bonventre J.V. Molnar A. Kyriakis J. Force T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4537-4546Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Although MST/Krs proteins are also activated by ROS, the mechanism of activation of MST/Krs proteins is apparently different from that of SOK-1. Therefore, MST/Krs activation may be an important event in response to oxidative stress in human tumor cell lines.To demonstrate a role for MST/Krs in cytotrienin A-induced apoptosis, we constructed expression vectors for kinase-inactive MST/Krs proteins by mutating a conserved Lys residue in an ATP binding pocket as Creasyet al. (19.Creasy C.L. Ambrose D.M. Chernoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21049-21053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) reported previously. We expected that the overexpression of kinase-inactive MST/Krs proteins could compete with endogenous MST/Krs proteins and function in a dominant negative fashion. As a result, the overexpression of kinase-inactive MST/Krs proteins may inhibit cytotrienin A-induced apoptosis. Indeed, the overexpression of the kinase-inactive MST/Krs proteins partially suppressed cytotrienin A-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5 A). On the other hand, the overexpression of the dominant negative c-Jun also partially suppressed cytotrienin A-induced apoptosis (Fig.5 B). We have previously shown that overexpression of kinase-inactive MST/Krs proteins inhibited apoptosis induced by treatment with MT-21 and that MST/Krs proteins also act upstream of JNK during MT-21-induced apoptosis (17.Watabe M. Kakeya H. Osada H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5211-5220Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). If both MST/Krs and JNK were located on the same signal cascade during cytotrienin A-induced apoptosis, the cotransfection of kinase-inactive MST/Krs and dominant negative c-Jun would also show strong inhibition of DNA fragmentation (Fig. 5 B). However, this linear model is contradicted by the following data: the activation of MST/Krs (p36) by cytotrienin A treatment was almost completely suppressed by the overexpression of kinase-inactive MST/Krs (Fig. 5 C), but the activation of JNK was not suppressed by the overexpression of kinase-inactive MST/Krs (Fig. 5 D). In addition, we previously reported that a caspase inhibitor, Z-Asp, suppressed MST/Krs activation but not JNK activation (13.Kakeya H. Onose R. Osada H. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4888-4894PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is more likely that JNK activation by cytotrienin A is independent of the caspase-MST/Krs signal and that two different signals from MST/Krs and JNK are required for a full induction of apoptosis by cytotrienin A. We previously reported that radical scavengers such as N-acetylcysteine and reduced glutathione suppressed cytotrienin A-induced activation of JNK and MST/Krs induced by cytotrienin A (13.Kakeya H. Onose R. Osada H. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4888-4894PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, two different signaling pathways may be divided downstream of ROS and upstream of the caspase cascade. Considering these results, both the activation of JNK and the caspase-mediated cleavage of MST/Krs proteins appear to be important for the induction of cell death by antitumor agents (Fig.6). This schematic model incorporates the previous reports that MST/Krs proteins function upstream of JNK (13.Kakeya H. Onose R. Osada H. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4888-4894PubMed Google Scholar,14.Graves J.D. Gotoh Y. Draves K.E. Ambrose D. Han D.K.M. Wright M. Chernoff J. Clark E.A. Krebs E.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2224-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). It suggests that there are several signaling pathways for JNK activation in response to stimulants.Figure 6A schematic model for apoptosis induction by cytotrienin A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Apoptosis is induced by a wide variety of cellular stresses, including DNA damage, UV radiation, ionizing radiation, and oxidative stress (1.Nagata S.

Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2175) Google Scholar). Caspases are a family of cysteine proteases expressed ubiquitously in multicellular organisms as latent pro-enzyme forms. Activation of pro-caspases is an obligatory step in the execution of apoptosis, and this activation takes place by proteolytic cleavage. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, three apoptosis-related genes have been cloned,ced-3, ced-4, and ced-9 (6.Hengartner M.O. Horvitz H.R. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1994; 4: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The former two genes are required for execution of the death program, whereas ced-9 prevents cell death. Mammalian homologues of Ced-3 and Ced-9 proteins have been identified as the interleukin-1β-converting enzyme cysteine protease (termed caspase-1) and Bcl-2, respectively (7.Yuan J. Shaham S. Ledoux S. Ellis H.M. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1993; 75: 641-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2233) Google Scholar, 8.Hengartner M.O. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 665-676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). The Ced-4 protein is homologous to the human protein Apaf-1, which participates in the activation of caspase-3 (9.Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2726) Google Scholar, 10.Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar). Caspase-3, an important effector caspase, is responsible for the cleavage of crucial substrates such as structural proteins, signaling proteins, and transcription-regulating proteins involved in the apoptotic process (1.Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4536) Google Scholar, 5.Nicholson D.W. Thornbery N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2175) Google Scholar). In particular, the fact that caspases regulate the activity of several protein kinases indicates that protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation mechanisms may play an important role in the initiation and progression of apoptosis. However, the role of individual targets in the common apoptotic signaling pathway triggered by anticancer agents is still uncertain. Cytotrienin A (Fig. 1), a novel ansamycin antitumor agent, was isolated from Streptomyces sp. as an apoptosis inducer (11.Kakeya H. Zhang H.-P. Kobinata K. Onose R. Onozawa C. Kudo T. Osada H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1997; 50: 370-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 12.Zhang H.-P. Kakeya H. Osada H. Tetrahedron Lett. 1997; 38: 1789-1792Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Recently, we have found that JNK1 and a 36-kDa kinase (termed p36 MBP kinase) are activated during the cytotrienin A-induced apoptosis in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells (13.Kakeya H. Onose R. Osada H. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4888-4894PubMed Google Scholar). This p36 MBP kinase is an active proteolytic product of the MST2/Krs1 and MST1/Krs2 protein kinases and were originally cloned by virtue of their homology to the budding yeast Ste20 kinase (13.Kakeya H. Onose R. Osada H. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4888-4894PubMed Google Scholar). Two other groups (14.Graves J.D. Gotoh Y. Draves K.E. Ambrose D. Han D.K.M. Wright M. Chernoff J. Clark E.A. Krebs E.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2224-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar,15.Lee K.-K. Murakawa M. Nishida E. Tsubuki S. Kawashima S.-I. Sakamaki K. Yonehara S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3029-3037Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) have also reported that MST1/Krs2 is cleaved by a caspase-3-like activity during Fas-induced apoptosis. Notably, Graves et al. (14.Graves J.D. Gotoh Y. Draves K.E. Ambrose D. Han D.K.M. Wright M. Chernoff J. Clark E.A. Krebs E.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2224-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) extensively examined the involvement of MST1/Krs2 together with mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade during apoptosis. It is possible that most apoptotic signals including the Fas-mediated signal and the cytotrienin-induced signal activate several pathways for apoptosis in a target cell. Unlike these apoptosis inducers, MT-21 (3-acetyl-4,5-dimethyl-5-octyloxy-3-pyrrolin-2-one), our synthetic apoptosis inducer, activates the signal from caspase-3, MST/Krs to JNK in a rather simple manner (16.Kakeya H. Onozawa C. Sato M. Arai K. Osada H. J. Med. Chem. 1997; 40: 391-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 17.Watabe M. Kakeya H. Osada H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5211-5220Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have investigated the caspase-mediated proteolytic activation of MST/Krs proteins in cytotrienin A-sensitive and -resistant human tumor cell lines. DISCUSSIONIn our previous studies (11.Kakeya H. Zhang H.-P. Kobinata K. Onose R. Onozawa C. Kudo T. Osada H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1997; 50: 370-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 12.Zhang H.-P. Kakeya H. Osada H. Tetrahedron Lett. 1997; 38: 1789-1792Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we identified a novel anticancer drug, named cytotrienin A, which is an ansamycin with a unique 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid in the molecule. Moreover, cytotrienin A induces apoptosis in human leukemia HL-60 cells via activation of p36 MBP kinase, an active proteolytic fragment of MST/Krs proteins (13.Kakeya H. Onose R. Osada H. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4888-4894PubMed Google Scholar). The MST/Krs proteins are Ste20-related protein kinases and are classified in the germinal center kinase subfamily (20.Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 162-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The germinal center kinase subfamily of p21-activated protein kinase-like kinases, which play regulatory roles in diverse cellular phenomena such as morphogenesis, stress-response, and proliferation, comprises at least 9 distinct members (germinal center kinase, HPK1, NIK, MST1/Krs2, MST2/Krs1, KHS, SOK1, Sps1p, and Nrk1p) (20.Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 162-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Very little is known about the regulation and function of these kinases, including the MST/Krs proteins. All of the antitumor agents that were used in the present study induced the activation of the MST/Krs proteins and DNA fragmentation in HL-60 cells (Fig. 2). As MST/Krs proteins might be a general component of apoptosis induction by antitumor agents, we investigated the relationship between the expression and proteolytic activation of MST/Krs proteins in response to anticancer agents, including cytotrienin A, in various human tumor cell lines.In HL-60 and Jurkat cells, which are highly sensitive to cytotrienin A, robust expression and proteolytic activation of MST/Krs proteins by caspase-3 were observed (Table I and Figs. 3 and 4). In contrast, cytotrienin A-resistant cell lines such as WI-38, A549, A431, HeLa, SH-SY5Y, and SMS-KCN expressed a very low amount of MST/Krs proteins, and there was no detectable proteolytic activation of MST/Krs proteins (Table I and Figs. 3 and 4). These effects of cytotrienin A are not dependent on the doubling time of each tumor cell line (data not shown). Although MKN74 cells expressed high levels of MST2/Krs1 and showed resistance to cytotrienin A treatment, there was no detectable proteolytic activation of MST/Krs by caspases (Fig. 3 B). K562 cells are also cytotrienin A-sensitive, but no activation of p36 MBP kinase was induced by cytotrienin A-treatment. K562 cells possess a Philadelphia chromosome with a translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 that generates the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase by the fusion of Bcr sequences upstream of the second exon of c-Abl. Bcr-Abl is known to inhibit chemotherapeutic drug-induced apoptosis (18.Amarante-Mendes G.P. McGahon A.J. Nishioka W.K. Afar D.EH Witte N.O. Green D.R. Oncogene. 1996; 16: 1383-1390Crossref Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Considering this, it may be possible that Bcr-Abl acts as an inhibitor of the signal that activates MST/Krs proteins and that there is a different signal for cytotrienin A-induced apoptosis not affected by Bcr-Abl. These results suggest that the proteolytic activation of MST/Krs proteins rather than expression level might correlate with apoptosis. There appears to be no correlation between the expression level of crucial components of the apoptotic program such as caspase-3, Bcl-2, and Bax (1.Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4536) Google Scholar, 21.Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar, 22.Chresta C.M. Masters J.R.W. Hickman J.A. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1834-1841PubMed Google Scholar) and the cytotrienin A sensitivity of the tested human tumor cell lines. To date, we have only examined the expression and activation of MST/Krs proteins in a limited number of cell lines in response to a small number of antitumor agents. A more systematic analysis of the expression and the activation of MST/Krs proteins should be helpful in studies aimed at finding new antitumor agents and testing the sensitivity of antitumor agents in human tumor cells.MST/Krs proteins consist of two family members, MST2/Krs1 and MST1/Krs2. Both proteins undergo caspase-mediated cleavage during apoptosis. MST2/Krs1 and MST/Krs2 possess consensus recognition sites for caspase-3, 319DELD322S and323DEMD326S, respectively (13.Kakeya H. Onose R. Osada H. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4888-4894PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Graves J.D. Gotoh Y. Draves K.E. Ambrose D. Han D.K.M. Wright M. Chernoff J. Clark E.A. Krebs E.G.

A. 1996; 93: 10099-10104Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 25.Creasy C.L. Chernoff J. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 167: 303-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, a synthetic inhibitor of caspase-3, Z-Asp-CH2-DCB, blocked proteolytic activation of both MST2/Krs1 and MST1/Krs2 proteins in cytotrienin A-sensitive human tumor cell lines, indicating that caspase-3 activation is necessary for the activation of p36 MBP kinase. In addition, we have shown that in both HL-60 and Jurkat cells, ROS induced by treatment with cytotrienin A play an important role in the caspase-mediated activation of p36 MBP kinase (Fig. 4, A andB). These results indicate that MST/Krs proteins are responsive to oxidative stress. Apoptosis induced by MT-21, a synthetic apoptosis inducer, is also blocked by N-acetylcysteine, a radical scavenger (17.Watabe M. Kakeya H. Osada H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5211-5220Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), supporting our present studies. SOK-1, another germinal center kinase family member, is directly activated via autophosphorylation triggered by ROS, but the kinase is not activated by growth factors, alkylating agents, cytokines, or environmental stresses such as heat shock and osmotic stress (26.Pombo C.M. Bonventre J.V. Molnar A. Kyriakis J. Force T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4537-4546Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Although MST/Krs proteins are also activated by ROS, the mechanism of activation of MST/Krs proteins is apparently different from that of SOK-1. Therefore, MST/Krs activation may be an important event in response to oxidative stress in human tumor cell lines.To demonstrate a role for MST/Krs in cytotrienin A-induced apoptosis, we constructed expression vectors for kinase-inactive MST/Krs proteins by mutating a conserved Lys residue in an ATP binding pocket as Creasyet al. (19.Creasy C.L. Ambrose D.M. Chernoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21049-21053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) reported previously. We expected that the overexpression of kinase-inactive MST/Krs proteins could compete with endogenous MST/Krs proteins and function in a dominant negative fashion. As a result, the overexpression of kinase-inactive MST/Krs proteins may inhibit cytotrienin A-induced apoptosis. Indeed, the overexpression of the kinase-inactive MST/Krs proteins partially suppressed cytotrienin A-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5 A). On the other hand, the overexpression of the dominant negative c-Jun also partially suppressed cytotrienin A-induced apoptosis (Fig.5 B). We have previously shown that overexpression of kinase-inactive MST/Krs proteins inhibited apoptosis induced by treatment with MT-21 and that MST/Krs proteins also act upstream of JNK during MT-21-induced apoptosis (17.Watabe M. Kakeya H. Osada H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5211-5220Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). If both MST/Krs and JNK were located on the same signal cascade during cytotrienin A-induced apoptosis, the cotransfection of kinase-inactive MST/Krs and dominant negative c-Jun would also show strong inhibition of DNA fragmentation (Fig. 5 B). However, this linear model is contradicted by the following data: the activation of MST/Krs (p36) by cytotrienin A treatment was almost completely suppressed by the overexpression of kinase-inactive MST/Krs (Fig. 5 C), but the activation of JNK was not suppressed by the overexpression of kinase-inactive MST/Krs (Fig. 5 D). In addition, we previously reported that a caspase inhibitor, Z-Asp, suppressed MST/Krs activation but not JNK activation (13.Kakeya H. Onose R. Osada H. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4888-4894PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is more likely that JNK activation by cytotrienin A is independent of the caspase-MST/Krs signal and that two different signals from MST/Krs and JNK are required for a full induction of apoptosis by cytotrienin A. We previously reported that radical scavengers such as N-acetylcysteine and reduced glutathione suppressed cytotrienin A-induced activation of JNK and MST/Krs induced by cytotrienin A (13.Kakeya H. Onose R. Osada H. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4888-4894PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, two different signaling pathways may be divided downstream of ROS and upstream of the caspase cascade. Considering these results, both the activation of JNK and the caspase-mediated cleavage of MST/Krs proteins appear to be important for the induction of cell death by antitumor agents (Fig.6). This schematic model incorporates the previous reports that MST/Krs proteins function upstream of JNK (13.Kakeya H. Onose R. Osada H. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4888-4894PubMed Google Scholar,14.Graves J.D. Gotoh Y. Draves K.E. Ambrose D. Han D.K.M. Wright M. Chernoff J. Clark E.A. Krebs E.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2224-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). It suggests that there are several signaling pathways for JNK activation in response to stimulants. In our previous studies (11.Kakeya H. Zhang H.-P. Kobinata K. Onose R. Onozawa C. Kudo T. Osada H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1997; 50: 370-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 12.Zhang H.-P.

https://openalex.org/W2069607910,"Ras plays an important role in a variety of cellular functions, including growth, differentiation, and oncogenic transformation. For instance, Ras participates in the activation of Raf, which phosphorylates and activates mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK), which then phosphorylates and activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), a mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase. Activation of MAP kinase appears to be essential for propagating a wide variety of extracellular signals from the plasma membrane to the nucleus. N17Ras, a GDP-bound dominant negative mutant, is used widely as an interfering mutant to assess Ras function in vivo. Surprisingly, we observed that expression of N17Ras inhibited the activity and phosphorylation of Elk-1, a physiological substrate of MAP kinases, in response to phorbol myristate acetate. The activity and phosphorylation of the MAP kinase hemagglutinin epitope (HA)-ERK1 were not affected by N17Ras in response to the same stimulus. Additionally, expression of N17Ras, but not L61S186Ras, a GTP-bound interfering mutant, inhibited MEK-induced Elk-1 phosphorylation, suggesting that inhibition of Elk-1 may be unique to GDP-bound Ras mutants. Finally, we observed that V12Ras-induced focus formation in NIH3T3 cells is inhibited by coexpression of GDP-bound Ras mutants, such as N17, A15, and N17N69. Therefore, N17Ras and V12 Ras may be codominant with respect to Elk-1 activation and cellular transformation. These results indicate that N17Ras appears to have at least two distinguishable functions: interference with endogenous Ras activation and inhibition of Elk-1 and transfomation. Furthermore, our data imply the possibility that GDP-bound Ras, like N17Ras, may have a direct role in signal transduction.

Oncogenic activation stabilizes Ras in a GTP-bound form, which is therefore constitutively active. Approximately 30% of all human tumors contain activating mutations in one of three Ha-ras genes (H, K, andNRas) (1.Lowy D.R. Willumsen B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 851-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar, 2.Katz M.E. McCormick F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Expression of active Ras mutants in established cell lines can lead to cellular transformation, and the same mutants cooperate with the Myc oncoprotein to transform primary cells, demonstrating a key role for Ras in cellular transformation (3.Land H. Parada L.F. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1983; 304: 596-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1965) Google Scholar). Genetic studies in Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans have established that Ras plays critical roles in several developmental events, including photoreceptor differentiation and vulval development (2.Katz M.E. McCormick F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Furthermore, microinjection of neutralizing Ras antibodies or expression of dominant negative Ras mutants demonstrated that Ras function is required for cell proliferation in response to serum and growth factors (4.Mulcahy L.S. Smith M.R. Stacey D.W. Nature. 1985; 313: 241-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, 5.Feig L.A. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3235-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). GTP-Ras has been shown to interact physically with numerous downstream targets and to activate several different signaling pathways (1.Lowy D.R. Willumsen B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 851-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar, 2.Katz M.E. McCormick F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). One of the best characterized Ras-activated pathways is the Raf-MEK1-ERK pathway, also known as the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade (6.Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar). Ras directly binds Raf in a GTP-dependent manner, and this interaction appears to be critical for the activation of Raf. Activated Raf phosphorylates and activates MEK, which in turn phosphorylates and activates the MAP kinase, ERK. Activation of ERK is essential for numerous Ras-induced cellular responses including transcription activation of immediate early genes, such as c-fos(6.Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar, 7.Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 8.Hill C.S. Treisman R.

The promoter of the proto-oncogene c-fos has been characterized extensively and is now considered a paradigm of transcription regulation in response to extracellular signals, including serum (7.Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 9.Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). The serum response element (SRE) within the c-fos promoter confers serum responsiveness to a basal promoter and functions via a transcription factor complex consisting of a dimeric serum response factor and, in some cases, an associated ternary complex factor (TCF) family member (7.Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 9.Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). One well characterized member of the TCF family is a ubiquitously expressed 62-kDa protein, Elk-1. MAP kinases phosphorylate numerous serine and threonine residues in the COOH-terminal transactivation domain of Elk-1 and in doing so, increase its transactivation potential (10.Marais R. Wynne J.

TCFs are thought to play significant roles in the induction of c-fos in response to oncogenic Ras and a variety of growth factors and cytokines (10.Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 381-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar, 11.Gille H. Sharrocks A.D. Shaw P.E.

Thus, phosphorylation of TCFs by activated MAP kinases reveals a linear pathway from Ras activation to transcriptional regulation. N17Ras is a dominant negative Ras mutant that binds GDP with preferential affinity over GTP. This property allows N17Ras to inhibit endogenous Ras activation by sequestering Ras-GEFs (5.Feig L.A. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3235-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 19.Chen S.Y. Huff S.Y. Lai C.C. Der C.J. Powers S.

Biol. 1999; 19: 6297-6305Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Expression of N17Ras can effectively inhibit serum-dependent cell proliferation, and this effect can be reversed by coexpression of oncogenic Ras or Ras-GEFs (5.Feig L.A. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3235-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 20.Quilliam L.A. Kato K. Rabun K.M. Hisaka M.M. Huff S.Y. Campbell-Burk S. Der C.J. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1996; 271: 11076-11082sAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Therefore, N17Ras has been proposed to inhibit selectively wild-type, but not oncogenic, Ras (23.Stacey D.W. Feig L.A. Gibbs J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4053-4064Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In contrast to N17Ras, L61S186 is a cytoplasmic, GTP-bound interfering Ras mutant (23.Stacey D.W. Feig L.A. Gibbs J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4053-4064Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 27.Michaeli T. Field J. Ballester R. O'Neill K. Wigler M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3039-3044Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). L61S186Ras interferes with signaling via a mechanism that is likely to involve titration of effectors away from the endogenous, membrane-associated Ras. Consistent with this, L61S186Ras appears to block signaling from both wild-type and oncogenic Ras (23.Stacey D.W. Feig L.A. Gibbs J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4053-4064Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that N17Ras should always be recessive to V12Ras. However, the dogma that the active GTP-bound form of Ras is dominant with respect to GDP-Ras is somewhat perplexing. For instance, a single copy of an active Ha-ras gene, in the presence of a single copy of a wild-type Ha-ras gene, is not sufficient to transform Rat-1 cells (28.Finney R.E. Bishop J.M. Science. 1993; 260: 1524-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Furthermore, loss of a normal copy ofras has been observed in numerous tumors containing active mutant ras alleles (29.Guerrero I. Villasante A. Corces V. Pellicer A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7810-7814Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 30.Diamond L.E. Guerrero I. Pellicer A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2233-2236Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 31.Bremner R.

These observations suggest that the absence of normal Ras gene product may facilitate transformation by the remaining activated mutant ras allele. Moreover, a GDP-bound Ras mutant, N17Ras, can effectively block transformation or neuronal survival induced by oncogenic Ras mutants (5.Feig L.A. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3235-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 25.John J. Rensland H. Schlichting I. Vetter I. Borasio G.D. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 923-929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We examined the effects of expressing the dominant interfering Ras mutant, N17Ras, on growth factor and phorbol ester-induced signaling. Phosphorylation and activation of Elk-1, a well known MAP kinase substrate, in response to PMA was specifically inhibited by N17Ras expression. However, MAP kinase activity stimulated by phorbol esters was not affected by N17Ras. Expression of either N17Ras or A15Ras, another GDP-bound interfering mutant, inhibited Elk-1 activation induced by V12Ras. The ability of N17Ras to inhibit Elk-1 requires Ras membrane association. In contrast, the ability to inhibit Ras activation is not required for N17Ras to inhibit Elk-1 because N17N69Ras, a noninterfering GDP-bound Ras mutant, retains the ability to block Elk-1. Furthermore, we observed that focus formation in NIH3T3 cells induced by GTP-Ras (V12Ras) is inhibited by N17Ras although it does not affect the nucleotide loading of V12Ras. These observations suggest that N17Ras may have functions in addition to interfering with endogenous Ras activation. COS-1 and CV-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). NIH3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transfections were performed using either DEAE-dextran as described previously (33.Sugimoto T. Stewart S. Han M. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1717-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) or LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) as recommended by the manufacturer. Expression vectors encoding Ras mutants were constructed by amplifying the appropriate mutant cDNA (templates encoding mutant Ha-Ras cDNAs were generously provided by Dr. L. Quilliam, Indiana University) by polymerase chain reaction followed by subcloning them into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) or pcDNA3-HA (33.Sugimoto T. Stewart S. Han M. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1717-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The identities of all constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Expression vectors encoding Elk-1, HA-ERK1, active MEK1 (MEK1*), active MEK3 (MEK3-DE), p38 MAP kinase, and V12Ras have been described (33.Sugimoto T. Stewart S. Han M. Guan K.L.

Pessin (University of Iowa), Y. Zhao (University of Michigan), and P. Stork (Oregon Health Sciences University), respectively. In general, CV-1 or NIH3T3 cells in 3.5-cm wells were transfected with 50 ng of Gal4 TCF chimeras (10.Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 381-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar, 18.Janknecht R. Hunter T.

Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar), 100 ng of a 5× Gal4-luciferase reporter, and 100–250 ng of each expression vector. c-fos luciferase (16.Hill C.S. Marais R. John S. Wynne J. Dalton S. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 395-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), 4× AP-1 luciferase (Stratagene), and 5× NF-κB luciferase (Stratagene) reporter genes were typically used at a concentration of 0.25 μg/3.5-cm well. Total DNA was kept constant by the addition of the appropriate amount of pcDNA3.1 for all transfections. Luciferase assays were performed as described previously (33.Sugimoto T. Stewart S. Han M. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1717-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and normalized for transfection efficiency and using a cotransfected β-galactosidase expression vector. Whole cell extracts were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore), and blotted with the indicated antibodies according to standard methods. α-ERK has been described (37.Zheng C.F. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19947-19952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); α-active MAP kinase was purchased from Promega; α-Elk-1 and α-phospho-383 Elk-1 were purchased from New England Biolabs; α-HA was purchased from Babco; α-FLAG was purchased from Sigma; α-Ha-Ras C-20 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. ERK kinase assays were performed as described previously (33.Sugimoto T. Stewart S. Han M. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1717-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). For RSK1 kinase assays, HA-tagged RSK1 was transfected into COS-1 cells as indicated in the figure legend and immunoprecipitated with α-HA antibody. Immunoprecipitated RSK1 activity was assayed using the S6 kinase assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) and quantified by scintillation counting. 36 h post-transfection, cells were metabolically labeled with 0.5 mCi/ml32PO4 for 4 h. Cells were solublized in buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2 containing a mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors). Ras was immunoprecipitated with α-Ras C-20 antibody or α-HA followed by extensive washing in lysis buffer and elution of bound nucleotides. Determination of the ratio of GDP versus GTP bound to each Ras mutant was performed as described (38.Gibbs J.B. Schaber M.D. Schofield T.L. Scolnick E.M. Sigal I.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6630-6634Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Focus formation assays were performed essentially as described previously (39.Clark G.J. Cox A.D. Graham S.M. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 395-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Briefly, low passage NIH3T3 cells were transfected with 50 ng of V12Ras with various Ras mutants (0.5 μg, except N17N69Ras, 1 μg). 24 h post-transfection, cells were trypsinized and plated in 10-cm dishes. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum and antibiotics. Fresh medium was added every 4 days. 14 days post-transfection foci were stained with methylene blue. Ras-transformed morphology was examined under a light microscope (39.Clark G.J. Cox A.D. Graham S.M. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 395-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). To understand more clearly the functions of Ras in MAP kinase-mediated transcriptional activation, we tested the dominant interfering Ras mutant, N17Ras (5.Feig L.A. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3235-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar), on Gal4-ElkC activity in CV-1 and COS-1 cells. In these cell lines PMA-stimulated ERK activity is not affected by N17Ras expression (40.Marais R. Light Y. Mason C. Paterson H. Olson M.F. Marshall C.J. Science. 1998; 280: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 41.Ueda Y. Hirai S. Osada S. Suzuki A. Mizuno K. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23512-23519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 42.de Vries-Smits A.M. Burgering B.M. Leevers S.J. Marshall C.J. Bos J.L.

Cell. 1992; 71: 335-342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). We observed that expression of N17Ras effectively blocked reporter gene activity, both under basal and PMA-stimulated conditions, in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.1 A, hatched bars). In addition, expression of a dominant negative version of the ERK activator MEK1, dnMEK (44.Zheng C.F. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1123-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), also significantly decreased normalized Gal4-ElkC activity (Fig. 1 A, open bars). In addition, we tested N17KRas and N17NRas, dominant interfering versions of the two other human Ras isoforms. Like Ha-Ras, expression of increasing amounts of dominant negative K or NRas inhibited PMA-induced Gal4-ElkC activity. However, expression of N17Rap1b, a closely related small GTPase, did not inhibit Gal4-ElkC activity (Fig. 1 B), suggesting that the inhibitory effect on Elk-1 we observe may be specific to dominant negative Ras mutants. These results suggest that both Ras and MAP kinase activation are required for Gal4-ElkC activity in response to PMA. We performed similar cotransfection experiments using a c-fos promoter reporter gene that requires intact TCF DNA binding sites for PMA or growth factor inducible activation (16.Hill C.S. Marais R. John S. Wynne J. Dalton S. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 395-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). PMA treatment of c-fos luciferase-transfected CV-1 cells resulted in an increase in normalized reporter gene activity (Fig.1 C). Like Gal4-ElkC, PMA-induced c-fos luciferase activity was reduced significantly by expression of N17Ras (Fig.1 C, compare columns 2 and 4). In contrast, expression of N17Ras resulted in little inhibition of either AP-1 or NF-κB reporter gene activity in response to PMA (Fig.1 C, compare columns 6 and 8 andcolumns 10 and 12). These data indicate that N17Ras selectively inhibits the induction of c-fos, but not AP-1 or NF-κB reporters. The above data are surprising because N17Ras has been reported to have no effect on ERK activation induced by PMA (40.Marais R. Light Y. Mason C. Paterson H. Olson M.F. Marshall C.J.

A simple explanation for the strong inhibitory effect of N17Ras on TCF-dependent reporter activity is that, in contrast to previous reports, N17Ras may block the activation of MAP kinase in our cell lines in response to PMA. To test this possibility, we expressed HA-tagged ERK1 (HA-ERK1) in COS-1 cells and measured PMA- or EGF-induced HA-ERK1 activity in an immunocomplex kinase assay using myelin basic protein as a substrate. Expression of N17Ras, which resulted in >80% inhibition of Gal4-ElkC reporter activity, had no effect on PMA-stimulated HA-ERK1 activity (Fig.2 A, compare columns 3 and 6). EGF-stimulated HA-ERK1 activity, however, was inhibited by N17Ras (Fig. 2 A, compare columns 2and 5). In contrast to N17Ras, dnMEK expression blocked both PMA- and EGF-stimulated HA-ERK1 activity (Fig. 2 A,columns 2 and 8). The activation state of ERK was also determined using a phosphorylation state-specific antibody (α-pERK). This antibody specifically recognizes the dual threonine/tyrosine-phosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2. The ERK polyclonal antibodies (α-ERK) used were raised against recombinant ERK1 and recognize endogenous ERK1 (Fig. 2 B,middle bands), transfected HA-ERK1 (Fig. 2 B,upper bands), and weakly recognize ERK2 (Fig. 2 B,lower bands). Expression of N17Ras had no effect on HA-ERK1 phosphorylation induced by PMA (Fig. 2 B, compare lanes 3 and 6). In contrast, N17Ras strongly inhibited EGF-stimulated HA-ERK1 phosphorylation (Fig. 2 B, comparelanes 4 and 7). Similar results were observed in CV-1 cells (data not shown). In addition, we performed a time course from 0 to 8 h monitoring HA-ERK1 phosphorylation in response to PMA in the presence or absence of N17Ras. Expression of N17Ras had little effect on HA-ERK1 phosphorylation from 0 to 8 h of PMA treatment (Fig. 2 C). Together, these results support the idea that the two stimuli tested, EGF and PMA, are likely to activate ERK by distinct mechanisms, only one of which is sensitive to inhibition by N17Ras, as is the case with EGF (40.Marais R. Light Y. Mason C. Paterson H. Olson M.F. Marshall C.J. Science. 1998; 280: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). This is consistent with previously published reports that N17Ras expression does not interfere with the activation of ERK in response to PMA treatment in COS-1 cells (40.Marais R. Light Y. Mason C. Paterson H. Olson M.F. Marshall C.J. Science. 1998; 280: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 41.Ueda Y. Hirai S. Osada S. Suzuki A. Mizuno K. Ohno S. J. Biol.

However, these results do not explain our observation that PMA-stimulated Elk-1 activity is inhibited by N17Ras, because Elk-1 is a direct target of active MAP kinases. We also examined the effects N17Ras on the activity of another ERK substrate, RSK1. RSK1 is a serine/threonine kinase whose activity is enhanced upon phosphorylation by ERK in vivo (35.Zhao Y. Bjorbaek C. Moller D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29773-29779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 45.Wood K.W. Sarnecki C. Roberts T.M. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 68: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). N17Ras had little effect on HA-RSK activity as determined by an immunocomplex kinase assay, both under basal and PMA-stimulated conditions. In contrast, expression of dominant negative MEK1 significantly abrogated PMA-stimulated HA-RSK1 activity (Fig.2 D). These observations indicate that HA-RSK activity is not inhibited by N17Ras, although ERK activation appears to be required for RSK activity. Previous reports have established that the transactivation activity of Elk-1, as well as other TCF members, is enhanced by MAP kinase phosphorylation at specific Ser/Thr residues in its activation domain (13.Cavigelli M. Dolfi F. Claret F.X. Karin M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5957-5964Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 14.Price M.A. Cruzalegui F.H. Treisman R.

In the case of Elk-1, phosphorylation at serine 383 leads to a significant enhancement of its trans-activation activity (10.Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 381-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar, 11.Gille H. Sharrocks A.D. Shaw P.E.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 951-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Using an Elk-1 phosphoserine 383-specific antibody, we observed that N17Ras reduced PMA-stimulated serine 383 phosphorylation of Elk-1 (Fig. 2 E). N17S186Ras, which is exclusively cytosolic (data not shown), was unable to inhibit Elk-1 phosphorylation, suggesting that membrane localization of N17Ras may be important for its ability to inhibit Elk-1 (Fig. 2 E). These results support our above observation that N17Ras expression specifically reduces TCF transcription activity and further demonstrate that N17Ras inhibits Elk-1. We tested whether the inhibition of Elk-1 is a common feature of dominant interfering Ras mutants or unique to N17Ras. L61S186Ras is a cytosolic GTP-bound Ras mutant that dominantly interferes with Ras signaling (23.Stacey D.W"
https://openalex.org/W1969870278,"CD11d encodes the latest α-subunit of the leukocyte integrin family to be discovered, and it is expressed predominantly in myelomonocytic cells. We have isolated a genomic clone that contains CD11d and showed this gene to be 11,461 bp downstream and oriented in the same direction as the relatedCD11c gene. CD11d transcription begins 69–79 nucleotides upstream of the ATG codon. Transfection analysis ofCD11d-luc reporter constructs revealed that the −173 to +74 region is sufficient to confer leukocyte-specific expression of luciferase in myelomonocytic cells (THP1 and HL60), B-cells (IM9), and T-cells (Jurkat). Transfection analysis showed that down-regulation of CD11d expression by phorbol ester was myelomonocyte-specific and is mediated by one or morecis-elements within the −173 to +74 region. In vitro DNase I footprint analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift analysis showed that Sp1 and Sp3 bind at −63 to −40. Deletion of the Sp-binding site significantly reduced CD11d promoter activity. Overexpression of either Sp1 or Sp3 in THP1 cells led to activation of the CD11d promoter even in the presence of phorbol ester, whereas down-regulation of either factor by antisense oligonucleotides decreased CD11d promoter activity. In contrast, overexpression of Sp3 in IM9 and Jurkat cells down-regulatedCD11d promoter expression. In vivo genomic footprinting revealed that the −63 to −40 region is bound by a Sp protein in unstimulated HL60 cells but not in phorbol ester-stimulated HL60 cells. In contrast, this site is bound in both unstimulated and phorbol ester-stimulated IM9 and Jurkat cells. Together, these results show that myelomonocyte-specific phorbol ester down-regulation ofCD11d is mediated through both Sp1 and Sp3."
https://openalex.org/W2145176206,"We demonstrate that two Myb-binding sites of the mouse plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase-1 (PMCA1) promoter are required for G1/S cell cycle stage-associated repression of PMCA1 promoter activity. Nuclear run-on experiments revealed G1/S-associated repression of PMCA1transcription. Ribonuclease protection assays revealed two transcription initiation sites between two Myb-binding sites in thePMCA1 promoter. Gel shift assays showed that c-Myb can bind to wild-type but not point mutated Myb binding sequences of thePMCA1 promoter. Transient transfection assays using cell cycle-synchronized vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) andPMCA1 promoter-luciferase constructs showed a 2-fold decrease in reporter activity at G1/S as compared with G0. Overexpression of wild-type c-Myb severely repressedPMCA1 promoter activity at both G0 and G1/S while co-transfection of a dominant negative c-Myb, or a construct encoding an anti-c-Myb neutralizing antibody, completely abolished the repression seen at G1/S. Single nucleotide substitutions in the first, second, or both Myb-binding sites alleviated the G1/S-associated repression ofPMCA1 promoter activity in transformed rat VSMC and primary mouse VSMC cultures. We conclude that c-Myb mediates G1/S-associated transcriptional repression of thePMCA1 Ca2+ pump in rodent VSMC by direct binding to the PMCA1 promoter.

Atchley W.R. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 74-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar)). Myb box proteins carry out a variety of functions including positive and negative transcriptional regulation, modulation of mRNA stability (2.Bein K. Ware J.A. Simons M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21423-21429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and the regulation of telomere length (3.Cooper J.P. Nimmo E.R. Allshire R.C. Cech T.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). They have diversified enormously in plants where they represent the largest known regulatory gene family (4.Romero I. Fuertes A. Benito M.J. Malpica J.M. Leyva A. Paz-Ares J. Plant J. 1998; 14: 273-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, only three family members (A-, B-, and c-myb) are known, of whichc-myb and its encoded gene product c-Myb have been well characterized. The c-Myb DNA-binding domain recognizes the consensus hexanucleotide sequence (C/T)AAC(G/T)G. c-Myb also contains transactivation and C-terminal negative regulatory domains. c-Myb expression is vitally important for the control of cell proliferation in a variety of cell types, and c-Myb is also involved in the regulation of apoptosis (reviewed in Ref. 5.Weston K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC)1 express c-Myb at the late G1 phase of the cell cycle (6.Simons M. Morgan K.G.

As contractile cells they are capable of effecting vascular tone. However, as proliferative cells they participate in vaso-occlusive processes such as atherosclerosis and post-angioplasty restenosis (8.Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9930) Google Scholar). In studying the mechanisms regulating VSMC proliferation, we have focused on the role played by c-Myb in the regulation of intracellular Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i) at the G1/S cell cycle interface. We have shown that c-Myb activity regulates [Ca2+]i in both VSMC and fibroblasts (9.Husain M. Jiang L. See V. Bein K. Simons M. Alper S.L. Rosenberg R.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1947-C1959Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Husain M. Bein K. Jiang L. Alper S.L. Simons M. Rosenberg R.D. Circ.

Physiol. 1997; 173: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Experiments employing either wild-type or dominant negative forms of c-Myb, in which cell cycle-associated Ca2+ homeostasis was monitored, implicated the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA) family of Ca2+ efflux pumps as critical mediators of c-Myb-dependent [Ca2+]i (9.Husain M. Jiang L. See V. Bein K. Simons M. Alper S.L. Rosenberg R.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1947-C1959Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Husain M. Bein K. Jiang L. Alper S.L. Simons M. Rosenberg R.D. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 617-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).The PMCAs are high affinity, low capacity, Ca2+ pumps that extrude cytosolic Ca2+ to the extracellular space (12.Penniston J.T.

Garcia-Martin E. Zecca A. Guidi F. Carafoli E. Acta Physiol. Scand. Suppl. 1998; 643: 265-273PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Brandt P. Neve R.L. Kammesheidt A. Rhoads R.E. Vanaman T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4376-4385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Western blot analysis has shown PMCA1 expression to exceed that of PMCA4(19.Stauffer T.P. Guerini D. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12184-12190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar).It is known that Ca2+ transporting membrane proteins play a major role in modulating Ca2+ signaling (20.Carafoli E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 395-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar). Indeed, the resting [Ca2+]i in many cell types is critically regulated by the level of PMCA activity (9.Husain M. Jiang L. See V. Bein K. Simons M. Alper S.L. Rosenberg R.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1947-C1959Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Furukawa K. Tawada Y. Shigekawa M. J. Biol.

However, despite the obvious importance of PMCAs to cellular Ca2+ handling, little is known of the mechanisms regulating their expression. A study on rat endothelial cells suggested that PMCA1 is regulated at the transcriptional level via a protein kinase C-dependent pathway (23.Kuo T.H. Wang K.K. Carlock L. Diglio C. Tsang W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2520-2525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our studies on VSMC showed that expression levels of PMCA1 are inversely correlated with levels of c-Myb activity, such that suppression of c-Myb activity led to 2–4-fold increases in the level of PMCA1 mRNA and protein (10.Husain M. Bein K. Jiang L. Alper S.L. Simons M. Rosenberg R.D. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 617-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These manipulations resulted in a 30% reduction in mean resting [Ca2+]i, a 42% decrease in mean S phase entry, and a 36% decrease in the mean cell proliferation rate of synchronized rat VSMC populations (10.Husain M. Bein K. Jiang L. Alper S.L. Simons M. Rosenberg R.D. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 617-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that a direct 2-fold overexpression of PMCA1, independent of any manipulation of c-Myb activity, resulted in similarly significant reductions in [Ca2+]i, G1 to S transitions, and rate of cell proliferation (9.Husain M. Jiang L. See V. Bein K. Simons M. Alper S.L. Rosenberg R.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1947-C1959Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Having demonstrated the physiological importance of PMCA1 regulation in VSMC, we now examine more closely the molecular interaction between c-Myb and thePMCA1 gene.Du et al. (24.Du Y. Carlock L. Kuo T.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 302-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) have previously cloned and sequenced 1010 bp of the mouse PMCA1 promoter. In their series of primer-extension and promoter-reporter assays carried out in mouse neural cells, they found the PMCA1 promoter to lack a TATA box, possess numerous SP1 sites, one long GC repeat within a CpG island, and an untranslated first exon that was at least 19 kilobases away from the translational start within exon 2. We have re-cloned and sequenced a 975-bp fragment of the above murine PMCA1promoter and have defined two VSMC-specific transcription initiation sites located between a pair of Myb-binding sites: Myb-binding site-1 and site-2 at positions +440 and +528, respectively (numbering is relative to the neural cell-specific transcriptional start site). We used ribonuclease protection assays, gel shift, and luciferase reporter assays to delineate the function of these two Myb-binding sites in the mouse PMCA1 promoter. Our experiments involved restriction digested deletants, single substitution point mutants in one or both Myb-binding sites, and effector constructs expressing either c-Myb, a dominant negative form of c-Myb, or an anti-Myb neutralizing antibody. Our studies show that the repression of the murine PMCA1gene at the G1/S interface of rodent VSMC requires both Myb-binding sites flanking the two transcriptional initiation sites.DISCUSSIONResults of numerous studies have revealed that the c-Myb transcription factor regulates [Ca2+]i during the G0 to S phase cell cycle progression of VSMC and fibroblasts (6.Simons M. Morgan K.G. Parker C. Collins E. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 627-632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Brown K.E. Kindy M.S. Sonenshein G.E. J. Biol.

Overexpression of wild-type c-Myb has been shown to increase [Ca2+]i at both the G0 and G1/S cell cycle stages as compared with control transfected cells (10.Husain M. Bein K. Jiang L. Alper S.L. Simons M. Rosenberg R.D. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 617-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), while the use of dominant negative c-Myb mutants demonstrated that reductions in c-Myb activity abolished the normal rise in both resting and stored [Ca2+]i as cells moved to the G1/S transition (10.Husain M. Bein K. Jiang L. Alper S.L. Simons M. Rosenberg R.D. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 617-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This latter effect was due to a marked increase in the Nae + -independent Ca2+ efflux rate, and was associated with important reductions in the rate of S-phase entry and cell proliferation (9.Husain M. Jiang L. See V. Bein K. Simons M. Alper S.L. Rosenberg R.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1947-C1959Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was subsequently shown that c-Myb activity levels are inversely related to mRNA and protein levels of PMCA1 (9.Husain M. Jiang L. See V. Bein K. Simons M. Alper S.L. Rosenberg R.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1947-C1959Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which normally show a ∼50% reduction at G1/S as compared with G0. Overexpression of PMCA1, independent of any manipulations in c-Myb activity, also resulted in increased rates of Ca2+efflux and significant reductions in [Ca2+]i, G1/S progression and proliferation (9.Husain M. Jiang L. See V. Bein K. Simons M. Alper S.L. Rosenberg R.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1947-C1959Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, abolition of the normal repression of endogenous PMCA1 expression at G1/S, by either dominant negative c-Myb constructs or overexpression of a transfected PMCA1, prevented the normal fall in the Ca2+ efflux rate and disabled the accumulation of intracellular Ca2+ (9.Husain M. Jiang L. See V. Bein K. Simons M. Alper S.L. Rosenberg R.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1947-C1959Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Husain M. Bein K. Jiang L. Alper S.L. Simons M. Rosenberg R.D. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 617-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Together, the above data led to our definition of the PMCA1 Ca2+ efflux pump as an end-effector of the c-Myb-dependent elevation in [Ca2+]i critically required for G1/S transitions in VSMC.Previous investigations into PMCA1 gene regulation have suggested the existence of agonist- and tissue-specific signaling pathways (23.Kuo T.H. Wang K.K. Carlock L. Diglio C. Tsang W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2520-2525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Du Y. Carlock L. Kuo T.H. Arch. Biochem.

Phorbol ester or angiotensin II treatments of non-synchronized rat aortic endothelial cell cultures were shown to produce protein kinase C-dependent increases inPMCA1 mRNA (8–20-fold) and protein (3–4-fold) within 4–6 h of agonist treatment (23.Kuo T.H. Wang K.K. Carlock L. Diglio C. Tsang W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2520-2525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A protein kinase A-dependent pathway was implicated in both cAMP- and thapsigargin-induced increases in PMCA1 expression in non-synchronized endothelial cells derived from resistance vessels of the rat brain (40.Kuo T.H. Liu B.F. Diglio C. Tsang W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 428-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Of interest, rat aortic endothelial cells did not show increases in PMCA1 levels in response to these latter agents (40.Kuo T.H. Liu B.F. Diglio C. Tsang W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 428-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Non-synchronized mouse neuroblastoma cells also responded to a 4-h treatment with phorbol ester by exhibiting a 5-fold increase in steady state PMCA1 mRNA (24.Du Y. Carlock L. Kuo T.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 302-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Importantly, the regulation of this response appeared to depend on transcriptional activation of thePMCA1 gene via a core promoter segment (−442 to +169) of the murine PMCA1 gene (24.Du Y. Carlock L. Kuo T.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 302-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). When cell cycle-synchronized rat VSMC are studied, the early stages of G1 progression (i.e. 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 h post-serum stimulation) also show significantly increased levels of PMCA1 mRNA as compared with either G0 or G1/S levels (9.Husain M. Jiang L. See V. Bein K. Simons M. Alper S.L. Rosenberg R.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1947-C1959Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of interest, these elevations in PMCA1 expression are coincident with the expression of early-response genes and with known mitogen-mediated elevations in [Ca2+]i (41.Berridge M.J. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). The above studies suggest that a variety of signal transduction pathways, early response genes, and/or transient increases in [Ca2+]iduring the early part of G0 to G1 progression may act to increase PMCA1 expression. However, the subsequent down-regulation of PMCA1 levels and PMCA1-mediated Ca2+ efflux rates at the G1/S interface (9.Husain M. Jiang L. See V. Bein K. Simons M. Alper S.L. Rosenberg R.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1947-C1959Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) requires an opposing effect on PMCA1 expression at this point in the cell cycle. The present study has elucidated a molecular mechanism through which c-Myb mediates this opposing effect.While it has recently been shown that c-Myb activity can decrease the half-life of thrombospondin 2 mRNA in mouse fibroblasts, the mechanism through which c-Myb mediated this effect was not elucidated (2.Bein K. Ware J.A. Simons M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21423-21429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Bein et al. (2.Bein K. Ware J.A. Simons M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21423-21429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) have speculated that c-Myb may transactivate the expression of a labile ribonuclease which in turn could account for the enhanced degradation of thrombospondin 2 mRNA. Although a c-Myb-dependent reduction in the stability of PMCA1 mRNA could conceivably contribute to the down-regulation of steady state PMCA1 mRNA levels at the G1/S interface, the findings of the present study suggest a transcriptional mechanism of PMCA1 regulation. Our nuclear run-on data show at least a 25% decrease in the rate ofPMCA1 transcription at G1/S as compared with G0 (data not shown). As it is difficult to document 2-fold differences in transcription rates with nuclear run-on assays, the above result is likely an underestimate of the reduction inPMCA1 transcription.Using MatInspector V2.2 (36.Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2421) Google Scholar), our analysis of the human PMCA1 gene sequence reveals two putative c-Myb-binding sites at position +988 and +1182. Indeed, a comparison of the human and murine PMCA1 promoter regions has revealed several other similarities as well (16.Hilfiker H. Strehler-Page M.A. Stauffer T.P. Carafoli E. Strehler E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19717-19725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both genes share features such as a large first intron (20–30 kilobases), a translational start in exon 2, and now two putative Myb-binding sites downstream of transcriptional start. Of interest, comparisons between pig and human PMCA1 cDNA sequences also show a high degree of sequence homology (85–90%) (16.Hilfiker H. Strehler-Page M.A. Stauffer T.P. Carafoli E. Strehler E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19717-19725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While an apparently significant mismatch at the exon 1-exon 2 interface is due to an exon in pig PMCA1 cDNA being absent from the human sequence, the missing human exon (termed exon 1*) is actually located in intron 1 of the human gene (16.Hilfiker H. Strehler-Page M.A. Stauffer T.P. Carafoli E. Strehler E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19717-19725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hilfiker et al.(16.Hilfiker H. Strehler-Page M.A. Stauffer T.P. Carafoli E. Strehler E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19717-19725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have speculated that some vertebrate tissues may expressPMCA1 with exon 1* as the first exon instead of exon 1 by virtue of an additional downstream promoter. Indeed, multiple SP1-binding sites and a consensus CCAAT box are present upstream of exon 1* in intron 1 of the human PMCA1 gene (16.Hilfiker H. Strehler-Page M.A. Stauffer T.P. Carafoli E. Strehler E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19717-19725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Although the 5′ regulatory region of the murine PMCA1 gene does have certain characteristics typical of housekeeping genes, such as the absence of a TATA box, multiple SP1-binding sites, and a high frequency of CpG dinucleotides (42.Bird A.P. Nature. 1986; 321: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (2992) Google Scholar), our data point to further complexity within this region. An earlier study (24.Du Y. Carlock L. Kuo T.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 302-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) of thePMCA1 promoter in mouse neural cells showed the presence of a neural-specific core promoter element (inactive in our VSMC line) while our data point to an additional promoter active in VSMC further downstream. More importantly, when the region spanning +301 to +557 was deleted (deletant pΔmyb1+2), we found a 60% reduction in luciferase activity at both G0 and G1/S when compared with the wild-type promoter which implies the loss of a major promoter element. This deletant lacks both Myb-binding sites and should not have been down-regulated at the G1/S stage via Myb-mediated repression. Also, this deletant's down-regulation at G0, when c-Myb levels are low, further suggests loss of a promoter element. Indeed, MatInspector analysis confirms that the region deleted from pΔmyb1+2 contains putative binding sites for several transcription factors including SP1, AP1, AP4, MyoD, MZF1, CREB, and a GC box element. Hence the lowering of luciferase activities at G0 and G1/S in this deletant is most likely due to the loss of a major cis-acting regulatory module promoting transcription initiation at +475 and +485. Deletion of the smooth muscle-specific promoter from pΔmyb1+2 does not lead to a complete loss of transcriptional activity in this mutant and we speculate that this may be due to the presence of a cryptic promoter element in the remaining 5′-flanking region within this mutant construct. There are many reports in the literature documenting the activation of cryptic promoters either upstream (43.Melton D.W. McEwan C. McKie A.B. Reid A.M.

Biochem. 1994; 225: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) of the major native promoter once this major promoter has been deleted or inactivated. Thus our data, together with those reported earlier (24.Du Y. Carlock L. Kuo T.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 302-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), suggest the presence of two promoters in the mouse PMCA1 gene: one element (spanning −256 to −118) active in neural cells and the other (between +301 to +485) active in VSMC.The preceding discussion has shown that the presence of multiple promoter elements with distinct transcriptional start sites is possible in the human PMCA1 gene and highly probable in the murine gene. This is analogous to the recent realization from transgenic mouse studies that multiple, independent, cis-regulatory modules are required to direct the developmental expression of muscle-specific genes. More specifically, a gene may have one promoter for skeletal muscle expression, another for cardiac expression, and one or more for expression in smooth muscle cells of various types (53.Firulli A.B. Olson E.N. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 364-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The tissue-specific activation of each promoter element would then be accomplished by unique sets of transcription factors. Indeed, this type of combinatorial regulation of gene expression appears to be a general strategy for tissue-specific expression in other genes as well (54.Simpson E.R. Michael M.D. Agarwal V.R.

https://openalex.org/W2317557552,"The simian double strand DNA tumor virus SV40 encodes the 90-kDa multi-functional protein, large T antigen (LT). LT functions by binding to DNA, as well as to many cellular target proteins such as p53 and retinoblastoma protein (pRB). We report here the identification of a cellular heat shock protein, HSP90, as a previously undescribed LT-associated protein. Immunoprecipitates by anti-HSP90 antibodies from LT-expressing cell lysates contained LT protein, as revealed by Western blotting. Conversely, anti-LT antibody co-immunoprecipitated HSP90. Co-immunoprecipitation of HSP90 and LT was observed even after complete immuno-depletion of p53, indicating that the association of LT with HSP90 is p53-independent. LT-HSP90 complexes can be reconstituted from purified HSP90 and unfolded-LT in vitro in an ATP-independent manner but not from HSP90 and native LT, suggesting that non-mature conformation of LT is required for the efficient association with HSP90. Moreover, geldanamycin, an anti-tumor drug that specifically binds and inhibits HSP90, reduced the intracellular concentration of LT by destabilizing newly synthesized LT. The above results suggest that HSP90 associates with immature forms of LT both in vivo and in vitro, and thus might assist LT in the formation of a functional, mature structure."

https://openalex.org/W2048888448,"Expression of the transcription unit early region 2 (E2) is of crucial importance for adenoviruses because this region encodes proteins essential for viral replication. Here, we demonstrate that the E1A12S protein of the oncogenic adenovirus serotype 12 activates the E2 promoter in dependence of the N terminus and the conserved region 1. Activation is mediated through a cAMP-response element that is bound by CREB-1 and ATF-1. Moreover, the Ad12 E2 promoter is inducible by protein kinase A and repressed by either a dominant-negative cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) mutant or the highly specific protein kinase A inhibitor protein underscoring the participation of CREB-1/ATF-1 in promoter activation. E1A12S binds to CREB-1 and ATF-1 in dependence of the N terminus and CR1 and is recruited to the E2 cAMP-response element through both cellular transcription factors. Most interestingly, point mutations revealed that E1A12S domains essential for binding to CREB-1/ATF-1 and for activation of the Ad12 E2 promoter are also essential for binding to the CREB-binding protein. Due to these data and results obtained in DNA-dependent protein-protein interaction assays, we propose a model in which the cAMP-independent activation of the Ad12 E2 promoter is mediated through a ternary complex consisting of CREB-1/ATF-1, E1A12S, and CREB-binding protein, which assembles on the E2 cAMP-response element.

In addition, these proteins modulate the expression of specific cellular genes in infected cells to facilitate viral reproduction (4.Bayley S.T. Mymryk J.S. Int. J. Oncol. 1994; 5: 425-444PubMed Google Scholar). E1A proteins are also able to act as oncoproteins that cooperate with Ad early region 1B oncogene products to transform rodent cells in culture and, depending on the serotype, to induce tumors in immunocompetent animals (e.g. Ad12; see Ref. 5.Williams J. Williams M. Liu C. Telling G. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 199/III: 149-177Google Scholar). Ad12 E1A gives rise to five proteins from which the 266R protein (translated from a 13 S mRNA; henceforth referred to as E1A13S) and the 235R protein (translated from a 12 S mRNA; E1A12S) are the predominant species (6.Brockmann D. Esche H. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 199/III: 81-112Google Scholar). Both proteins are translated in the same reading frame but differ in a short stretch of 31 aa called CR3 that is absent in E1A12S. CR3 is one of three E1A regions (CR1, CR2, and CR3) that are highly conserved among Ad serotypes (7.Kimelmann D. Miller J.S. Porter D. Roberts B.E. J. Virol. 1985; 53: 399-409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Besides the non-conserved N terminus, the CRs contain most of the gene regulatory functions necessary for viral reproduction and transformation (6.Brockmann D. Esche H. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 199/III: 81-112Google Scholar). Due to the lack of a sequence-specific DNA binding activity (8.Ferguson B. Kripple B. Andrisani O. Jones N. Westphal H. Rosenberg M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 2653-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), E1A proteins modulate gene expression through protein/protein interactions with cellular factors. The bZip family of transcription factors that is involved in cellular proliferation, differentiation, transformation, and stress response (9.Angel P. Imagawa M. Chiu R. Stein B. Imbra R.J. Rahmsdorf H.J. Jonat C. Herrlich P. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 49: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2155) Google Scholar, 10.Canman C. Kastan M.B.

Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2310) Google Scholar) is one important target for E1A. This family includes the Jun, Fos, and ATF proteins as well as cAMP-responsive transcription factors like CREB-1. To fulfill their gene regulatory functions these factors form either homo- (e.g. CREB-1/CREB-1) or selected heterodimers (e.g. CREB-1/ATF-1), which bind to specific response elements in the promoter of target genes (11.Karin M. Liu Z.-G. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2310) Google Scholar, 12.Montminy M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 807-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). Several studies have shown that transcriptional regulation through this family of transcription factors is accompanied by binding to cellular cofactors like p300 and CBP (13.Snowden A.W. Perkins N.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 55: 1947-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The cAMP/PKA pathway is involved in a number of physiological processes including intermediary metabolism, gene expression, and cellular proliferation (12.Montminy M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 807-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar, 14.Taylor S.S. Buechler J.A. Yonemoto W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 971-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). In response to cell surface signals, intracellular cAMP levels are raised enabling the rapid dissociation of the regulatory and catalytic subunits of the PKA holoenzyme in the cytoplasm followed by the passive translocation of the active catalytic subunit into the nucleus. Here, PKA phosphorylates the cellular transcription factor CREB at Ser-133. Phospho-CREB on its turn recruits the cellular coactivator CBP to the CRE which leads to the transcriptional activation of cAMP-dependent target genes (12.Montminy M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 807-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). E1A positively or negatively modulates the PKA pathway through interaction with CBP. By targeting CBP and disrupting transcription factor-coactivator complexes, E1A is able to repress cAMP-dependent transcription (15.Arany Z. Newsome D. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Eckner R. Nature. 1995; 374: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 16.Lundblad J.R. Kwok R.P.S. Laurance M.E. Harter M.L. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1995; 374: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). For instance, by binding to p300 or CBP the Ad2/Ad5 E1A12S protein prevents the transactivation function of CREB in transient expression assays using either the rat somatostatin CRE in a heterologous promoter context (15.Arany Z. Newsome D. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Eckner R. Nature. 1995; 374: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), a truncated somatostatin promoter (16.Lundblad J.R. Kwok R.P.S. Laurance M.E. Harter M.L. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1995; 374: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar), or the intact interleukin-6 promoter (15.Arany Z. Newsome D. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Eckner R. Nature. 1995; 374: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has been shown that the Ad2/Ad5 E1A12S protein activates the human PCNA promoter via CREB (17.Lee B.H. Mathews M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4481-4486Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Moreover, using the CREB/ATF recognition sequence of the fibronectin promoter, Lee et al. (18.Lee J.-S. Zhang X. Shi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17666-17674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the Ad2/Ad5 E1A12S protein activates or down-regulates CREB-mediated reporter gene expression in a cell type-specific manner. Although many Ad promoters contain CREs, viral gene expression can occur independently of cAMP stimulation (19.Sassone-Corsi P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7192-7196Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 20.Flint J. Shenk T. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1989; 23: 141-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). It is therefore of interest to understand how viral genome expression takes places to find out (i) the composition of protein complexes binding to these CREs and (ii) the regulation of the activity of these complexes through E1A irrespective of cAMP. Here we present evidence that Ad12 E1A12S activates the E2 promoter through a CRE (E2-CRE, located at nucleotides −99 to −92 relative to the transcriptional start site) dependent on the N terminus and CR1. The E2-CRE is bound by CREB-1 and ATF-1. Mutational analyses revealed that the transactivation of the Ad12 E2 promoter through E1A12S correlates with the binding of the adenoviral protein to CREB-1/ATF-1 and with the ability of the viral protein to associate with the CREB coactivator CBP. Most interestingly, CREB-1 and ATF-1 recruit E1A12S to the E2-CRE, and the amount of E1A12S bound to the CREB-1·E2-CRE complex is increased 2–4-fold in the presence of CBP. On the basis of these results we propose a model in which transcriptional activation of the Ad12 E2 promoter is attributed to the assembly of a quaternary complex consisting of CREB-1/ATF-1, E1A12S, the cellular coactivator CBP, and the E2-CRE. The expression vector pRc/RSV-235R encoding the E1A12S protein of Ad 12 E1A was described elsewhere (21.Brockmann D. Tries B. Esche H. Virology. 1990; 179: 585-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). E1A12S deletion or point mutants were generated by PCR using wild type pRc/RSV-235R as template and respective primers that contain HindIII sites at their 5′-ends. After digesting withHindIII amplified mutant DNA was cloned into pRc/RSV (Invitrogen). The following mutants were constructed: ΔN/235R (lacking aa 1–29 of E1A12S), ΔCR1/235R (lacking aa 39–79), Δ1–79/235R (lacking aa 1–79), R2G/235R (substitution of arginine at position 2 by glycine), D16A/235R (substitution of asparagine at position 16 by alanine), I18P/235R (substitution of isoleucine at position 18 by proline), L19S/235R (substitution of leucine at position 19 by serine), and D24A/235R (substitution of asparagine at position 24 by alanine). Bacterial expression vectors encoding the various E1A12Sproteins as fusions were constructed by cloning their cDNAs amplified by PCR into the BamHI site of the prokaryotic GST fusion expression vector pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). His6-E1A12S was cloned by introducing the cDNA for the Ad12 E1A12S into the BamHI site of the vector pQE-8 (Qiagen). To express CREB-1 by in vitrotranscription/translation, its cDNA was cloned by PCR into the pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen) using pRc/RSV-CREB-1 as template. AHindIII-NotI fragment obtained from pRc/RSV-CBP was cloned into the vector pCR3.1 (Invitrogen) to generate pCR3.1-CBP. This plasmid was used for in vitro transcription/translation of full-length CBP. The plasmid pRc/CMV-A-CREB encodes a dominant-negative inhibitor of CREB (22.Ahn S. Olive M. Aggarwal S. Krylov D.

PGEX-CBP was constructed by cloning a BamHI fragment from pRc/RSV-CBP into the bacterial expression vector pGEX-2T. CBP fragments expressing exclusively the KIX-domain (CBPKIX, aa 461–682) or the minimal KIX domain interacting with the KID domain of CREB-1 (CBPmKIX; aa 586–666; see Ref. 12.Montminy M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 807-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar) were generated by PCR using respective primers and cloned into pGEX-2T. To generate E2Ad12-(420 bp)-CAT, a 420-bp fragment corresponding to nt 25,921 to 25,501 of the Ad12 genome (24.Sprengel J. Schmitz B. Heuss-Neitzel D. Zock C. Doerfler W. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 379-389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR using Ad12 DNA as template and cloned into the basal CAT reporter construct pBL-CAT3 (25.Luckow B. Schütz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 10: 5490Crossref Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). E2Ad12-(389 bp)-CAT, E2Ad12-(324 bp)-CAT, E2Ad12-(215 bp)-CAT, and E2Ad12-(140 bp)-CAT were cloned in a similar manner using respective primers. E2Ad12ΔE2F-(140 bp)-CAT, E2Ad12ΔCRE-(140 bp)-CAT, E2Ad12pmE2F-(140 bp)-CAT, E2Ad12pmCRE-(140 bp)-CAT, and E2Ad12pmTATA-(140 bp)-CAT were obtained by PCR using E2Ad12-(140 bp)-CAT as template and primers that resulted in the complete deletion or point mutation (Fig. 1) of either the E2F site, the CRE or the TATA box. The sequence of all constructs was verified using the ALF sequencing system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). KB (human oral epidermoid carcinoma), human embryo kidney (HEK) cells transformed with the Ad12 EcoRI-C fragment; see Ref. 26.Whittaker J.L. Byrd P.J. Grand R.J.A. Gallimore P.H. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 1981; 23: 175-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar) cells were grown at 37 °C (5% CO2) as monolayer cultures in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. For transient expression assays 1 μg of the respective Ad12 E2 reporter construct was cotransfected with different amounts of the respective expression vectors into 2.5 × 105 KB cells as indicated in the figures using the LipofectAMINE method according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). The transfection was stopped after 5 h. 24 h later cells were harvested and lysed by the freeze and thaw treatment. The protein concentration was analyzed by the Bradford method (28.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216377) Google Scholar). Equal amount of protein was used to determine CAT activity (29.Gorman C. Merlino G. Willingham M. Pastan L. Howard B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6777-6781Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). The percentage of acetylated chloramphenicol was quantified using the automatic TLC linear analyzer of Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany. Nuclear extracts were prepared from KB cells as described (30.Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar). For gel retardation assays (31.Fried M. Crothers D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6505-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1686) Google Scholar, 32.Garner M. Revzin A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 3047-3060Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar) an Ad12 E2-CRE oligonucleotide (5′-(GGG)TTGTTG TGACGTCA CTTTTCCC-3′, representing nt −105 to −84 of the Ad12 E2 promoter corresponding to nt 25,611 to 25,590 of the Ad12 genome) was synthesized (MWG Biotechnology). For radioactively end-labeling three guanosines were synthesized at the 5′-ends of the oligonucleotides and filled in using [α-32P]dCTP and the Klenow fragment ofEscherichia coli DNA polymerase (33.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The binding reaction was performed in 20 μl in the presence of 10 mmHepes/KOH, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 1 μg of salmon sperm DNA using 3 μg of nuclear extract, and 1 ng of 32P-end-labeled Ad12 E2-CRE oligonucleotide for 20 min at RT. The incubation mixtures were loaded on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed at 200 V in 0.5× TBE. For antibody perturbation analyses, nuclear extracts were preincubated with 2 μg of the appropriate antibody at 4 °C overnight. The following antibodies were used: anti-ATF-1 (C41–5.1), anti-CREB-1 (C-21, cross-reactive with ATF-1), anti-CREB-1 (X-12), anti-ATF-2 (C-19), and anti-c-Jun (KM-1) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For competition experiments a 10- or 100-fold molar excess of the respective unlabeled competitor was added simultaneously with the32P-labeled Ad12 E2-CRE-oligonucleotide to the binding reaction. As competitors the following were used: a CRE somatostatin promoter oligonucleotide (5′-CGCCTCCTTGGC TGACGTCA GAGAGAGAGTTT-3′, nt −60 to −29 of the rat somatostatin promoter; see Ref. 34.Montminy M.R.

The GST leader protein and GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21 bacteria and purified from the soluble fraction of the bacterial lysate as described previously (36.Brockmann D. Bury C. Kröner G. Kirch H.-C. Esche H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10754-10763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For GST-pull-down assays with in vitro transcribed/translated 35S-labeled ATF-1 and CREB-1, 25 μg of the appropriate GST-E1A fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with 100,000 cpm ofin vitro translated CREB-1 or ATF-1. Binding reactions were performed in PC+150 buffer (20 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.9, 150 mm KCl, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.5 mm Pefabloc (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 2 μg/μl BSA) for 1 h at RT. After extensive washings interacting proteins were eluted with SDS-sample buffer, resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and visualized by fluorography. 35S-Labeled ATF-1, CREB-1, CBP, and E1A12S were synthesized using T7 or SP6 RNA polymerase (Promega) and the TNT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Induction of His6-E1A12S expression and purification of the fusion protein via nickel-chelate affinity chromatography were performed as described by Qiagen. GST-pull-down assays using purified full-length GST-CBP or respective GST-CBP fragments (50 μg) and purified His6-E1A12S (2 μg) were performed as described above. Interaction was analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-Ad12 E1A antiserum (see below). 9.2 × 106 COS7 cells were transfected by electroporation with 15 μg of the wild type or mutant E1A12S expression vectors as described (37.Melkonyan H. Sorg C. Klempt M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4356-4357Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) except that 10 mm glucose and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol were included in the electroporation buffer. For immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed 72 h later in lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.9, 100 mmKCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaF, 0.5 μg/μl BSA, 0.5 mm Pefabloc, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) by rocking for 30 min at 4 °C. Whole cell extracts (1 mg) were precleared with normal rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 60 μl of protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. Precleared extracts were then incubated with an anti-CBP rabbit polyclonal antiserum (A-22; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), an anti-CREB antiserum (Ab240; see Ref. 38.Yamamoto K.K. Gonzalez G.A. Menzel P. Rivier J. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1990; 60: 611-617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), or an anti-ATF1 mouse monoclonal antibody (FI-1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose at 4 °C overnight. Immune complexes were collected, washed three times in 1 ml of lysis buffer without BSA, eluted in 1× SDS-sample buffer, and resolved on 13% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis proteins were transferred to a Hybond C-extra nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the membrane was probed with the anti-Ad12 E1A antiserum as described previously (39.Lipinski K.S. Fax P. Wilker B. Hennemann H. Brockmann D. Esche H. Virology. 1999; 255: 94-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Enhanced chemiluminescence was carried out using the Super Signal Ultra Chemiluminescence detection system (Pierce). For Western blot analyses 10% of the whole cell extract prepared from transfected cells was used. For DNA-dependent protein-protein interaction analyses, a 5′-biotinylated oligonucleotide containing the Ad12 E2-CRE recognition motif (corresponding to nt −113 to −80 of the Ad12 E2 promoter) was synthesized with a C24-atom spacer to reduce steric hindrance (Metabion, Martinsried, Germany): 5′-TACTCATCTTGTTG TGACGTCA CTTTTCCCGCC-3′. Purified, double-stranded oligonucleotide (1 μg) was incubated within vitro translated ATF-1 or CREB-1 and 25 μl of a slurry of neutravidin-agarose (Pierce) in PC+150 buffer (20 mmHepes/KOH pH 7.9, 150 mm KCl, 12.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.5 mm Pefabloc (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 2 μg/μl BSA) for 1 h at RT. Thereafter DNA-protein complexes were collected and washed three times with 1 ml of PC+150 buffer. DNA-protein complexes were then incubated in PC+150 buffer with35S-labeled E1A12S and/or CBP, respectively. Bound complexes were pelleted and washed three times with 1 ml of PC+150 buffer, eluted in 1× SDS-sample buffer, resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and visualized by fluorography. The putative Ad12 E2 promoter region as described by Sprengel et al. (see Ref. 24.Sprengel J. Schmitz B. Heuss-Neitzel D. Zock C. Doerfler W. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 379-389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; nt 25,921 to 25,501 of the Ad12 genome) was analyzed for transcription factor binding sites using the TFSearch version 3.1 program (40.Heinemeyer T. Wingender E. Reuter L. Hermjakob H. Kel A.E. Kel O.V. Ignatieva E.V. Ananko E.A. Podkolodnaya O.A. Kolpakov F.A. Podkolodny N.L. Kolchanov N.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 364-370Crossref Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). A CRE (E2-CRE; nt −99 to −92 relative to the transcriptional start site) as well as one consensus E2F recognition sequence (nt −89 to −82) were identified (Fig.1). Moreover, a TATA box is located at position nt −29 to −24 (Fig. 1). To analyze to what extent these binding sites contribute to basal as well as E1A12S-mediated activation of the Ad12 E2 promoter and whether promoter elements not identified by computer analyses participate too, we performed transient expression assays. 5′-Progressive Ad12 E2 promoter truncations and point mutants were constructed, and the activity of the resulting E2Ad12-CAT reporter constructs was determined after cotransfection with an E1A12S expression vector (pRc/RSV-235R) in KB cells. E2Ad12-(420 bp)-CAT containing the full-length Ad12 E2 promoter displayed a low basal CAT activity if transfected without E1A12S into KB cells (Fig. 1). Cotransfection of pRc/RSV-235R led to a 5.3-fold induction of CAT gene expression (Fig.1). CAT gene expression strictly depends on E2 promoter sequences because the basic reporter construct pBL-CAT3 showed neither a basal nor an E1A12S-induced CAT gene expression (Fig. 1). Promoter truncations up to nt −140 (E2Ad12-(389 bp)-CAT, E2Ad12-(324 bp)-CAT, E2Ad12-(215 bp)-CAT, and E2Ad12-(140 bp)-CAT) did not interfere with basal or with E1A12S-induced reporter activity (Fig. 1). However, deletion or point mutations of the E2-CRE (E2Ad12ΔCRE-(140 bp)-CAT and E2Ad12pmCRE-(140 bp)-CAT) resulted in a transcriptional inactive reporter construct (Fig. 1). In contrast to the mutations in the CRE, deletion or point mutants of the E2F-binding site (E2Ad12ΔE2F-(140 bp)-CAT and E2Ad12pmE2F-(140 bp)-CAT) did not prevent basal nor E1A12S-activated CAT gene expression although E1A12S-mediated activation of E2Ad12pmE2F-(140 bp)-CAT was reduced compared with the E2 wild type reporter construct (Fig. 1). These data indicate that the E2F-binding site is of secondary importance for E2 promoter activation in transient expression assays in KB cells. As expected, point mutations in the TATA box led to a loss of basal as well as E1A12S-induced reporter gene expression (Fig. 1). Thus, we conclude that (i) nt −420 to −140 are dispensable for the activation of the Ad12 E2 promoter through E1A12Sand (ii) the E2-CRE at position nt −99 to −92 and the TATA box at position −29 to −24 are essential elements for promoter activation. However, the participation of the E2F site in promoter activation is not yet clear and is currently under investigation. Recently, we have identified the very N terminus (aa 1–29) and CR1 of E1A12S as independent transactivation domains (41.Lipinski K.S. Kröner-Lux G. Esche H. Brockmann D. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To determine whether both domains are involved in the activation of the Ad12 E2 promoter, we cotransfected E1A12S deletion mutants lacking the N terminus (aa 1–29; ΔN/235R), CR1 (aa 39–79; ΔCR1/235R), or aa 1–79 (Δ1–79/235R) with E2Ad12-(140 bp)-CAT in KB cells. CAT assays revealed that none of the E1A12S deletion mutants was able to induce reporter gene expression (Fig.2 B). Furthermore, using point mutants we identified three aa in the N terminus whose mutations led either to a greatly reduced (D16A/235R; Fig. 2 B) or to a loss (I18P/235R, L19S/235R; Fig. 2 B) of the transactivation potential of the N terminus. Contrary to this result, mutation of the arginine residue at position 2 (R2G/235R) or of the aspartic acid residue at position 24 (D24A/235R) had no influence on the transactivation potential. Both point mutants induced reporter gene expression with E1A12S wild type efficiency (Fig.2 B). Western blot analyses confirmed the comparable expression level of all E1A12S mutants in transiently transfected cells (Fig. 8 B) excluding that differences of the transactivation potentials were due to insufficient expression of the E1A mutant proteins.Figure 8Activation of the Ad12 E2 promoter through the E1A12S protein correlates with the binding of the adenoviral protein to the cellular coactivator CBP. A,the E1A12S protein binds to CBP in dependence of the N terminus and CR1. COS7 cells were transiently transfected with either the wild type or mutant E1A12S expression vectors as indicated. 72 h later cells were lysed, and precleared extracts were incubated with an anti-CBP (A-22) rabbit polyclonal antiserum. Immune complexes were analyzed on 13% SDS-polyacrylamide gels followed by Western blotting using the anti-Ad12 E1A antiserum. Lane 1 shows a Western blot using extracts from Ad12 E1-transformed cells (HEK; Ref. 26.Whittaker J.L. Byrd P.J. Grand R.J.A. Gallimore P.H. Mol. Cell.

A nuclear factor 1 (NF-1) -like element was identified in the proximal promoter region of rat, mouse, rabbit, and humanCYP1A2 genes through data base analysis. In vitro DNase I footprinting with a −211 to +81 probe from the ratCYP1A2 gene and nuclear extracts from rat liver and olfactory mucosa revealed a single protected region corresponding to the NF-1-like element at −129 to −111. Protein binding to this NF-1-like element was tissue-selective and was confirmed by in vivo footprinting in native chromatin from rat liver. Multiple DNA-binding complexes were detected in gel-shift assays using theCYP1A2 NF-1-like element and nuclear extracts from liver and olfactory mucosa, all of which were supershifted in the presence of an anti-NF1 antibody. The NF-1-like element was essential for transcriptional activity of the CYP1A2 gene in an in vitro transcription assay using nuclear extracts from the two tissues. Thus, members of the NF-1 family of transcription factors may play an important role in the tissue-selective expression of theCYP1A2 gene in the liver and olfactory mucosa.

Each tissue expresses a subset of xenobiotic-metabolizing P450 genes which determines, to a large extent, sensitivity of that organ to the toxicity of a given chemical compound. Variation in the levels of expression of P450 genes is one of the major contributing factors in interindividual and interspecies differences in susceptibility to environmental toxicants. Changes in P450 expression may result from alterations in those regulatory mechanisms, such as the transcriptional regulatory elements and the protein factors, which are potential targets for genetic polymorphism and cytotoxic events. However, despite recent progress in our understanding of xenobiotic-induced CYP gene expression, very limited advance has been made in identifying the elements and factors involved in the constitutive tissue- or cell-type-selective expression of xenobiotic-metabolizing P450s. CYP1A2 is constitutively expressed preferentially in the liver (1.Quattrochi L.C. Tukey R.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 66-71PubMed Google Scholar) and the olfactory mucosa (2.Ding X. Coon M.J.

Gallagher E.P. Bammler T.K. Kunze K.L. Pharmacogenetics. 1995; 5: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Tissue-specific gene expression may be regulated by cell-type-specific as well as ubiquitous transcription factors (21.Mitchell J.P Tijan R. Science. 1989; 245: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (2209) Google Scholar). Previous studies on the liver-selective expression of P450 genes in the CYP2family suggested that each P450 gene may be controlled by unique regulatory mechanisms (22.Gonzalez F.J. Lee Y.H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1112-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Little is known of the mechanisms involved in tissue-selective, constitutive expression of the CYP1A2gene. An early study found that a 1.8-kilobase pair mouseCyp1a2 5′-flanking sequence (−1843 to +52) was insufficient for constitutive expression of a reporter gene in mouse hepatoma Hepa-1 cells (23.Owens R.A. Nebert D.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 172: 1109-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). However, a recent study (6.Quattrochi L.C. Vu T. Tukey R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6949-6954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) identified two regions in the 5′-flanking sequence of the human CYP1A2 gene that were required for induction by 3-methylcholanthrene in transiently transfected human hepatoma cell line HepG2. One (−2532 to −2423) binds the AhR and the other (−2259 to −1987), which was subsequently shown to function as an enhancer (12.Quattrochi L.C. Shih H. Pickwell G.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 350: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), contains an AhR-binding site as well as two conserved AP-1 sites and a TATA box. In a similar study (24.Chung I. Bresnick E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 677-685PubMed Google Scholar), a proximal 42-bp (−72 to −31) DNA and a distal 259-bp (−2352 to −2094) DNA of the human CYP1A2 gene were found to be important for the constitutive expression of a reporter gene construct in transiently transfected HepG2 cells. The distal sequence contained three protein-binding sites, including an AP-1 site and a site for the liver specific transcription factor HNF-1 (25.Chung I. Bresnick E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 338: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The proximal sequence contains GC, CCAAT, and TATA boxes, but protein binding to these potential sites was not demonstrated (24.Chung I. Bresnick E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 677-685PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, recent studies with the AhR−/− mice indicated that targeted disruption of the AhR gene led to decreased constitutive expression of CYP1A2 in mouse liver (7.Fernandez-Salguero P. Pineau T. Hilbert D.M. McPhail T. Lee S.S. Kimura S. Nebert D.W. Rudikoff S. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Science. 1995; 268: 722-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar, 8.Schmidt J.V. Su G.H. Reddy J.K. Simon M.C. Bradfield C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6731-6736Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar), although it is not yet clear whether the partial dependence of constitutive CYP1A2 expression on the AhR resulted from direct or indirect mechanisms and whether it is unique to the liver. Recently, we have identified a conserved NF-1-like binding site (named the NPTA element) potentially involved in transcriptional activation and tissue-selective expression of rat CYP2A3, mouseCyp2a5, and human CYP2A6 genes in the olfactory mucosa (26.Zhang J. Ding X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23454-23462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The NPTA element interacts with unique proteins detected only in the olfactory mucosa. Interestingly, a survey of availableCYP gene 5′-flanking sequences revealed that an NF-1-like sequence was also present in the proximal promoter region of rat, mouse, rabbit, and human CYP1A2 genes. Because CYP1A2 is also expressed selectively in the olfactory mucosa, in addition to the liver, the present study was conducted to determine whether this NF-1-like sequence is also important for its transcriptional activation and tissue-selective expression. Thus, the proximal promoter region of rat CYP1A2 gene was analyzed using a number of approaches to demonstrate tissue-specific binding of nuclear proteins to this NF-1-like sequence and consequent transcriptional activation. Furthermore, olfactory mucosal and hepatic proteins bound to this NF-1-like sequence in the CYP1A2 gene were compared with the olfactory mucosal NPTA-binding proteins to determine whether the two genes share common regulatory pathways. Intact nuclei were isolated from liver of 2-month-old rats essentially as described elsewhere (26.Zhang J. Ding X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23454-23462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 27.Gorski K. Carneiro M. Schibler U. Cell. 1986; 47: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar, 28.Kim J. Kemper B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10287-10294Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) with modifications. Fresh tissues were dissected and immediately immersed in 100 volumes of cold 0.9% NaCl solution for 1 min. The tissues were minced into small pieces with a razor blade, washed sequentially in 10 volumes of an ice-cold washing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.7, containing 150 mm NaCl and 15 mm sodium citrate) and 5 volumes of a homogenization buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.7, containing 10 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm spermidine, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.5% Tergitol NP-10, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and homogenized on ice in 3 volumes of the homogenization buffer in a Dounce homogenizer for 4–6 strokes with pestle B and then 6–8 strokes with pestle A. The homogenates were filtered through two layers of cheesecloth and, following dilution with 8 tissue volumes of 2.2 m sucrose in the homogenization buffer, applied to a 10-ml cushion of 2 m sucrose in homogenization buffer and spun at 24,000 rpm for 60 min at 2 °C in a prechilled SW28 rotor. The resultant nuclear pellet was resuspended in 10 volumes of a DNase I digestion buffer (15 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.7, containing 0.5 mm spermidine, 0.15 mm spermine, 80 mm KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5 mmCaCl2) and spun again at 3000 rpm for 5 min in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge. The purified nuclei were resuspended in the DNase I digestion buffer at about 5 absorbance unit (at 260 nm)/ml and treated with 4–30 unit/ml DNase I (Promega) on ice for 5 min. The reaction was terminated by incubating with 1/5 volume of a DNase I stop buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, containing 200 mm NaCl, 30 mm EDTA, 1.2% SDS, and 1 mg/ml proteinase K) at 50 °C for 50 min. The samples were then treated with DNase-free RNase A (40 μg/ml) at 42 °C for 1 h and extracted once with an equal volume of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25/24/1). The isolated DNA was further digested with HindIII (which does not cut in theCYP1A2 proximal promoter region) to reduce viscosity, purified again by extraction, and used as templates in ligation-mediated PCR as described below. Ligation-mediated PCR was performed essentially as described by Mueller and Wold (29.Mueller P.R. Wold B. Science. 1989; 246: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar), with some modifications. A nested set of three primers specific to the rat CYP1A2 gene were used for amplifying the antisense strand (Primers 1–3, see Fig.2 C), with the same linker primers and ligation adaptors as described previously (29.Mueller P.R. Wold B. Science. 1989; 246: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). First strand DNA synthesis with primer 1 and denatured genomic DNA from DNase I-treated nuclei, PCR amplification with primer 2 and the linker primer, and labeling reaction with32P-labeled primer 3 were all performed with use of Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). The PCR products were extracted, and the footprints were analyzed by electrophoresis through a 6% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea DNA sequencing gel as described (26.Zhang J. Ding X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23454-23462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). DNA sequence G ladder was produced by ligation-mediated PCR (29.Mueller P.R. Wold B. Science. 1989; 246: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar) of purified rat liver genomic DNA that had been treated with 1% dimethyl sulfate and piperidine according to Maxam and Gilbert (30.Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9013) Google Scholar). To determine DNase I sensitivity of isolated genomic DNA, a sample of the DNA (20 μg) in 200 μl of a digestion buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.7, containing 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) was treated with 1–3 × 10−4 units of DNase I at room temperature for 5 min. The reaction was stopped by mixing with an equal volume of a stop solution (200 mm NaCl, 30 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml tRNA). The DNA sample was purified by extraction prior to ligation-mediated PCR. Procedures for in vitro transcription have been described recently (26.Zhang J. Ding X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23454-23462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), as modified from Ueno and Gonzalez (31.Ueno T. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4495-4505Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and Tamura et al. (32.Tamura T. Konishi Y. Makino Y. Mikoshiba K. Methods Com. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 10: 312-319Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Plasmids used as templates in in vitro transcription assays were constructed in pCR-Script vector (Stratagene). Plasmid p1A2–412 was constructed by inserting a −412 to +293 fragment of the ratCYP1A2 gene at the SrfI site of the vector; this fragment was obtained by PCR using rat genomic DNA as a template and primers (sense, 5′-ccctatctgcctctgtgggga-3′; antisense, 5′-gctttggtgttctgatggacaga-3′) designed according to the published sequence (33.Sogawa K. Gotoh O. Kawajiri K. Harada T. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5026-5032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid p1A2–412/M was made by site-directed mutation of p1A2–412 to convert a “CA” dinucleotide (−115 and −114) to an “AG” using the Transformer Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit fromCLONTECH. The mutagenesis experiment was performed as described previously for CYP2A3 promoter analysis (26.Zhang J. Ding X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23454-23462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), with use of two mismatched oligonucleotide primers: one containing the intended sites of mutation in CYP1A2 promoter (5′-gggatcatggcttgaagcagagaattg-3′) and the other containing a mutation in the unique EcoRI site in the vector (5′-ttgatatcgaagtcctgcagcc-3′). A control plasmid, p2A3–254 (26.Zhang J. Ding X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23454-23462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), was used in experiments with olfactory mucosa, and another control plasmid, pTTR-3000/2A6, containing a full-length CYP2A6 cDNA driven by a 3-kilobase pair TTR promoter fragment (34.Yan C. Costa R.H. Darnell Jr., J.E. Chen J. Van Dyke T.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 869-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), was used in experiments with liver. The CYP2A6 cDNA fragment was cloned by RNA-PCR from human hepatic RNA and the TTRpromoter fragment (−3000 to +20, lacking the ATG codon) was derived as a SalI/HindIII fragment from a pTTR-CAT plasmid obtained from Dr. Robert H. Costa of the University of Illinois at Chicago. The structures of all promoter constructs were verified by sequencing. The oligonucleotide probes used for detecting CYP1A2, CYP2A3, and CYP2A6 transcripts in S1 nuclease protection assays were complementary to +28 to +51 of the CYP1A2 gene, +1 to +51 of the CYP2A3 gene, and +10 to +42 of the CYP2A6 cDNA. The sizes of the protected fragments detected in S1 nuclease assays were estimated from the positions of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide fragments analyzed on the same gels, as described previously (26.Zhang J. Ding X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23454-23462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). All oligonucleotides were synthesized by the Molecular Genetics Core of the Wadsworth Center. Detailed procedures for the preparation and purification of 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probes for gel-shift assays, [32P]ATP end-labeled PCR primers, and single-stranded DNA probes for S1 nuclease protection assays have been described previously (26.Zhang J. Ding X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23454-23462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). 32P-labeled, double-stranded cDNA probes for DNase I footprinting experiments were prepared by PCR with one 5′-end-labeled primer (coding strand, 5′-gatatttatctccatggacccagaa-3′; or noncoding strand, 5′-cctttctgtgtgtctgtatgga-3′) and one unlabeled primer of the complementary strand with the p1A2–412 plasmid as a template. All animals were obtained from breeding stocks maintained at the Wadsworth Center. Pooled tissues from 2-month-old male Wistar rats (four/group) were used for the preparation of crude and enriched nuclear extracts as described previously (26.Zhang J. Ding X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23454-23462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobility shift and supershift assays were performed as described recently (26.Zhang J. Ding X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23454-23462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For supershift experiments, 2 μl of a control rabbit serum or a polyclonal rabbit anti-CTF1 serum (35.Mermod N. O'Neill E.A. Kelly T.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1989; 58: 741-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar) kindly provided by Dr. Naoko Tanese of New York University Medical Center was incubated at room temperature with the nuclear extracts from either liver or olfactory mucosa for 1 h before the addition of the labeled probe (1A2pm). In vitro DNase I footprinting analyses were performed with the Core Footprinting System from Promega, as described earlier (26.Zhang J. Ding X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23454-23462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). DNA sequence analyses were performed by the Molecular Genetics Core of the Wadsworth Center using an automated sequencer from Applied Biosystems (Model 373A, Foster City, CA). Protein concentration in nuclear extracts was determined using BCA reagent (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The concentrations of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probes were estimated based on the amounts of starting material in the labeling reactions, whereas the concentration of 32P-labeled PCR products for footprinting experiments were estimated from the band intensity on ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels using known amounts of DNA as standards. Approximately 1.2 kilobase pairs of rat CYP1A2 promoter and 5′-flanking sequences have been reported previously (33.Sogawa K. Gotoh O. Kawajiri K. Harada T. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5026-5032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A single NF-1-like element, located at −129 to −111, was found by searching the TRANSFAC data base (36.Heinemeyer T. Wingender E. Reuter I. Hermjakob H. Kel A.E. Kel O.V. Ignatieva E.V. Ananko E.A. Podkolodnaya O.A. Kolpakov F.A. Podkolodny N.L. Kolchanov N.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar) using the TFSEARCH program, 2Y. Akiyama, TFSEARCH: Searching Transcription Factor Binding Sites,http://www.rwcp.or.jp/papia. with the threshold set at 85.0 (Fig. 1). Similar sequences were also found in the proximal promoter region of mouseCyp1a2, at −130 to −112 (37.Gonzalez F.J. Kimura S. Nebert D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5040-5049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), rabbit CYP1A2, at −122 to −104 (38.Strom D.K. Postlind H. Tukey R.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 294: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and human CYP1A2, at −129 to −111 (39.Ikeya K. Jaiswal A.K. Owens R.A. Jones J.E. Nebert D.W. Kimura S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1399-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In all four genes, the NF-1-like element is located at about 80 bp upstream of a conserved TATA box. However, the NF-1-like element is not present in the human CYP1A2 proximal promoter sequence reported by another group (1.Quattrochi L.C. Tukey R.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 66-71PubMed Google Scholar), as a result of a single nucleotide deletion (Fig. 1). Nevertheless, sequence analysis of humanCYP1A2 proximal promoter region with genomic DNA derived from 100 individuals (50 each Caucasian and African American) did not detect the variant allele at the NF-1-like element (data not shown), suggesting that it is rare. A comparison of the CYP1A2NF-1-like element with the NPTA element in the CYP2A3 gene revealed significant homology at sites critical for NPTA binding (26.Zhang J. Ding X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23454-23462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The presence of a highly conserved NF-1 site in the proximal promoter region of rat, mouse, and rabbit CYP1A2 genes suggests potential functional importance in gene regulation, because the three orthologous genes are all known to be expressed tissue selectively and abundantly in the liver and olfactory mucosa. To determine whether this NF-1-like element interacts with DNA-binding proteins, in vitro DNase I footprinting analysis was performed using a −211 to +81 probe from the rat CYP1A2 gene with nuclear extracts from different rat tissues. As shown in Fig.2 A, a single, unambiguous DNase I footprint (−109 to −131) was identified on the noncoding strand with nuclear extracts from rat liver and olfactory mucosa, but not with those from testis and kidney. However, a partial protection of the same site was observed with extracts from the lung. Similar results were observed with a probe labeled on the coding strand, with the protected region at −129 to −107 (Fig. 2 B). The specificity of protein binding to this site was confirmed by using an unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide, 1A2pm (corresponding to −133 to −107, Fig. 2 C), which comprises the protected sequence, and two other oligonucleotides, 1A2pmmut1 and 1A2pmmut2 (Fig.2 D), which contain dinucleotide mutations in the critical regions for NF-1 (40.Gronostajski R.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5545-5559Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 41.Gronostajski R.M. Adhya S. Nagata K. Guggenheimer R.A. Hurwitz J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 964-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and NPTA binding (26.Zhang J. Ding X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23454-23462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2,A and B, the footprint was completely abolished when 1A2pm was added at 80× excess but was only partially removed or not affected by the addition of 1A2pmmut1 and 1A2pmmut2, respectively. Binding of nuclear proteins to the NF-1-like element in the ratCYP1A2 gene was confirmed by in vivo DNase I footprinting experiments. The sequence of the proximal promoter region (33.Sogawa K. Gotoh O. Kawajiri K. Harada T. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5026-5032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the location of the three primers used for ligation-mediated PCR are shown in Fig. 2 C. In contrast to a single protected region (−129 to −107) detected in in vitro experiments, several footprints were revealed by in vivo footprinting (Fig. 3) on the noncoding strand in the native chromatin of rat liver, as compared with the DNase I digestion pattern of protein-free, purified rat genomic DNA. The footprints shown were reproducible, even with different DNase I concentrations. The most prominent footprint (−95 to −131 bp) contained the NF-1-like sequence, but the boundaries extended beyond those detected by in vitro footprinting. Additional footprints were detected both upstream and downstream of the NF-1-like element, including one (−21 to −34 bp) corresponding to a TATA box (42.Wefald F.C. Devlin B.H. Williams R.S. Nature. 1990; 344: 260-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and a weaker one (−87 to −65) containing sequences similar to GATA-1- or GATA-2-binding sites (43.Merika M. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3999-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Highly conserved binding sites for the Nkx-2.5 factor (44.Chen C.Y. Schwartz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15628-15633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) and the AP-4 protein (45.Hu Y.F. Luscher B. Admon A. Mermod N. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1741-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) are also present in this region, as shown in Fig.2 C, but corresponding footprints were not found. No unambiguous in vivo footprints were detected in rat olfactory mucosa or lung (data not shown) most likely because of the heterogeneous cell types present in these tissues and the use of the highly sensitive PCR procedure. The tissue-selective expression of nuclear proteins bound to theCYP1A2 NF-1-like binding site was investigated in gel-shift experiments with nuclear extracts from rat liver, olfactory mucosa, testis, kidney, and lung. As shown in Fig.4 A, with the 1A2pm probe, prominent protein-DNA complexes were detected with nuclear extracts from liver and olfactory mucosa but not in the other tissues examined. Weak signals were observed with lung extracts, which had much slower mobilities than the major bands detected in liver and olfactory mucosa. These observations are consistent with the results from DNase I footprint assays and with CYP1A2 being predominantly expressed in liver and olfactory mucosa but not the other tissues. Multiple bands were detected with nuclear extracts from both liver and olfactory mucosa, but there were clear differences in the banding patterns between the two samples (Fig. 4 A, lanes 1 and 2); the most predominant complex formed with olfactory proteins, which had the highest mobility of all bands detected, was undetectable in the liver. The other bands also had subtle differences in mobilities between the two tissues. Binding specificity was demonstrated by nearly complete inhibition of binding activities of liver (Fig. 4 B) and olfactory (Fig.4 C) nuclear extracts by unlabeled 1A2pm probe but not by two mutated oligonucleotides (1A2pmmut1 and 1A2pmmut2) or unrelated oligonucleotide competitors (data not shown). These results indicate that liver and olfactory nuclear proteins interacting with the NF-1-like element in rat CYP1A2 gene may be different. To determine potential interactions between CYP2A3NPTA-binding proteins and proteins bound to the CYP1A2NF-1-like element, competition experiments were performed with labeled 1A2pm and 2A3pm probes, respectively, and nuclear"

https://openalex.org/W2315880968,"Gene amplification is frequently present in human tumors, although specific target genes relevant to many amplified loci remain unidentified. An expression cloning assay enabled identification of a candidate oncogene derived from human chromosome 3p14.1. The cDNA retrieved from morphologically transformed cells contained the full-length protein coding region and detected an abundant transcript in the same cells. Sequence analysis revealed identity with the wild-type sequence of p44S10, a highly conserved subunit of the 26S proteasome that exhibits similarity to the Arabidopsis fus6/cop11 family of signaling molecules. p44S10 gene copy number and mRNA expression were increased in association with segmental 1.8 - 11-fold chromosomal gains in cutaneous malignant melanoma cell lines (5/13; 40%) and tumors (2/40; 5%), and in breast cancer MCF-7 cells. Likewise, malignant progression of human radial growth phase WM35 melanoma cells was associated with amplification and increased expression of endogenous p44S10, and increased expression of p44S10 was sufficient to induce proliferation of WM35 cells in vivo. The results demonstrate segmental copy number gains within chromosome 3p in cutaneous malignant melanoma and suggest that deregulation of a proteasome regulatory particle subunit may contribute to the malignant phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2332152864,"Allelic deletions of multiple chromosome 17q loci in sporadic ovarian cancer of epithelial origin suggest that inactivation of tumor suppressor gene(s) in these regions may be important for ovarian tumorigenesis. To further define the pattern of allelic imbalance in epithelial ovarian tumors of different histologies, a PCR-based assay was used to assess loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of polymorphic markers representative of TP53, BRCA1, NME1 and GH1, and region 17q23-25. LOH was observed for at least one marker in 68% of malignant tumors (n=60) and in 18% tumors of borderline malignancy (n=11), but not in benign tumors (n=5). The highest frequency of LOH in malignant tumors (64%) was observed with D17S801 on 17q25. Ten of 39 malignant ovarian tumors displaying LOH of at least one 17q marker, displayed a LOH pattern enabling the determination of a minimal region of overlapping deletion defined by D17S795 and D17S801. One borderline tumor also displayed an interstitial LOH pattern that overlapped this 17q25 minimal region of deletion. The histologies of malignant tumors displaying a pattern indicative of interstitial 17q deletions were of the endometrioid, clear cell and mucinous epithelial types. As the minimal region of overlap defined by these tumors overlap regions deleted in malignant tumors of all histologic types, and in a tumor of borderline malignancy, the 17q25-tumor suppressor may be implicated in the development of all types of epithelial ovarian tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2318746276,"In order to study interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family mediation of cell growth regulation, we established U937 cell lines stably transfected with a truncated form of IRF-2 lacking the transcriptional repressor domain. The truncated IRF-2 contained the DNA binding domain (DBD) and bound the ISRE. Phenotypically, the IRF-2 DBD transfectants exhibited reduced cell growth, altered morphology and increased cell death. Consistent with alterations in growth characteristics, the IRF-2 DBD transfectants constitutively expressed higher levels of the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF1/Cip1 than did control clones. The level of p21WAF1/Cip1 expression was positively correlated with the level of DBD expressed, as well as with the level of growth inhibition in these clones. DBD expression also correlated with expression of other members of the growth regulatory complex, cyclin dependent kinase 2 and cyclin A, but not proliferating cell nuclear antigen. These results imply active repression by IRF-2 to keep p21WAF1/Cip1 transcriptionally silent."
