Despite such importance, the crystal structure of nanoconfined water remains largely unknown. Here we report high-resolution electron microscopy of mono- and few- layers of water confined between two graphene sheets, an archetypal example of hydrophobic confinement. Confined water is found to form square ice at room temperature - a phase with symmetry principally different from the conventional tetrahedral geometry of hydrogen bonding. The square ice has a high packing density with a lattice constant of 2.83 angstrom and during TEM observation assembles in bi- and tri- layer crystallites exhibiting AA stacking. Our findings are important for understanding of interfacial phenomena and, in particular, shed light on ultrafast transport of water through hydrophobic nanocapillaries. Our MD simulations show that square ice is likely to be common inside hydrophobic nanochannels, independent of their exact atomic makeup."

https://openalex.org/W2025621984,"Observations of an ultrafast accretion-disk wind in the X-ray spectrum of a nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxy support the theory that such winds affect the evolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies. Francesco Tombesi et al. report the detection of a powerful accretion-disk wind with a mildly relativistic velocity in the X-ray spectrum of IRAS F11119+3257, a nearby (z = 0.189) optically classified type 1 ultraluminous infrared galaxy hosting a powerful molecular outflow. The energetics of these winds are consistent with the suggestion that active galactic nuclei winds can provide an efficient way to transfer energy to the interstellar medium and support the theory that such winds affect the evolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies. Powerful winds driven by active galactic nuclei are often thought to affect the evolution of both supermassive black holes and their host galaxies, quenching star formation and explaining the close relationship between black holes and galaxies1,2. Recent observations of large-scale molecular outflows3,4,5,6,7,8 in ultraluminous infrared galaxies support this quasar-feedback idea, because they directly trace the gas from which stars form. Theoretical models9,10,11,12 suggest that these outflows originate as energy-conserving flows driven by fast accretion-disk winds. Proposed connections between large-scale molecular outflows and accretion-disk activity in ultraluminous galaxies were incomplete3,4,5,6,7,8 because no accretion-disk wind had been detected. Conversely, studies of powerful accretion-disk winds have until now focused only on X-ray observations of local Seyfert galaxies13,14 and a few higher-redshift quasars15,16,17,18,19. Here we report observations of a powerful accretion-disk wind with a mildly relativistic velocity (a quarter that of light) in the X-ray spectrum of IRAS F11119+3257, a nearby (redshift 0.189) optically classified type 1 ultraluminous infrared galaxy hosting a powerful molecular outflow6. The active galactic nucleus is responsible for about 80 per cent of the emission, with a quasar-like luminosity6 of 1.5 × 1046 ergs per second. The energetics of these two types of wide-angle outflows is consistent with the energy-conserving mechanism9,10,11,12 that is the basis of the quasar feedback1 in active galactic nuclei that lack powerful radio jets (such jets are an alternative way to drive molecular outflows)."
https://openalex.org/W2101836435,"The detection of a single photon from a laser interacting with an atomic ensemble is shown to produce entanglement of almost 3,000 atoms; in contrast to previous production of multi-atom entanglement, the highly non-classical nature of the present entangled state is verified by measurement of a negative quasiprobability distribution. Entanglement is the crucial resource that quantum technologies harness for classically impossible applications. Large ensembles of entangled particles promise to be useful in quantum metrology, but they are difficult to produce. Vladan Vuletić and colleagues demonstrate how the detection of a single photon from a laser interacting with an atomic ensemble can produce entanglement of almost 3,000 atoms. Entanglements of atomic ensembles with many atoms have been produced before, but they showed only weak signs of non-classicality, as quantified by the Wigner function. The entangled atoms described here, however, show a negative Wigner function and are thus highly non-classical, providing a realistic route to 'Schrödinger's cat' states in large atomic ensembles. The result has yet to be optimized to yield a quantum advantage in metrology applications but it is an important step towards this goal. Quantum-mechanically correlated (entangled) states of many particles are of interest in quantum information, quantum computing and quantum metrology. Metrologically useful entangled states of large atomic ensembles have been experimentally realized1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10, but these states display Gaussian spin distribution functions with a non-negative Wigner quasiprobability distribution function. Non-Gaussian entangled states have been produced in small ensembles of ions11,12, and very recently in large atomic ensembles13,14,15. Here we generate entanglement in a large atomic ensemble via an interaction with a very weak laser pulse; remarkably, the detection of a single photon prepares several thousand atoms in an entangled state. We reconstruct a negative-valued Wigner function—an important hallmark of non-classicality—and verify an entanglement depth (the minimum number of mutually entangled atoms) of 2,910 ± 190 out of 3,100 atoms. Attaining such a negative Wigner function and the mutual entanglement of virtually all atoms is unprecedented for an ensemble containing more than a few particles. Although the achieved purity of the state is slightly below the threshold for entanglement-induced metrological gain, further technical improvement should allow the generation of states that surpass this threshold, and of more complex Schrödinger cat states for quantum metrology and information processing. More generally, our results demonstrate the power of heralded methods for entanglement generation, and illustrate how the information contained in a single photon can drastically alter the quantum state of a large system."

https://openalex.org/W2119356526,"This study determined the contribution of extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling to the protective adaptation of human skeletal muscle known as the repeated-bout effect (RBE). Muscle biopsies were obtained 3 hours, 2 days, and 27 days following an initial bout (B1) of lengthening contractions (LCs) and 2 days following a repeated bout (B2) in 2 separate studies. Biopsies from the nonexercised legs served as controls. In the first study, global transcriptomic analysis indicated widespread changes in ECM structural, deadhesive, and signaling transcripts, 3 hours following LC. To determine if ECM remodeling is involved in the RBE, we conducted a second study by use of a repeated-bout paradigm. TNC immunoreactivity increased 10.8-fold following B1, was attenuated following B2, and positively correlated with LC-induced strength loss (r(2) = 0.45; P = 0.009). Expression of collagen I, III, and IV (COL1A1, COL3A1, COL4A1) transcripts was unchanged early but increased 5.7 ± 2.5-, 3.2 ± 0.9-, and 2.1 ± 0.4-fold (P < 0.05), respectively, 27 days post-B1 and were unaffected by B2. Likewise, TGF-β signaling demonstrated a delayed response following LC. Satellite cell content increased 80% (P < 0.05) 2 days post-B1 (P < 0.05), remained elevated 27 days post-B1, and was unaffected by B2. Collectively, the data suggest sequential ECM remodeling characterized by early deadhesion and delayed reconstructive activity that appear to contribute to the RBE."
https://openalex.org/W2064825879,"The continued development and utility of molecular dynamics simulations requires improvements in both the physical models used (force fields) and in our ability to sample the Boltzmann distribution of these models. Recent developments in both areas have made available multi-microsecond simulations of two proteins, ubiquitin and Protein G, using a number of different force fields. Although these force fields mostly share a common mathematical form, they differ in their parameters and in the philosophy by which these were derived, and previous analyses showed varying levels of agreement with experimental NMR data. To complement the comparison to experiments, we have performed a structural analysis of and comparison between these simulations, thereby providing insight into the relationship between force-field parameterization, the resulting ensemble of conformations and the agreement with experiments. In particular, our results show that, at a coarse level, many of the motional properties are preserved across several, though not all, force fields. At a finer level of detail, however, there are distinct differences in both the structure and dynamics of the two proteins, which can, together with comparison with experimental data, help to select force fields for simulations of proteins. A noteworthy observation is that force fields that have been reparameterized and improved to provide a more accurate energetic description of the balance between helical and coil structures are difficult to distinguish from their ""unbalanced"" counterparts in these simulations. This observation implies that simulations of stable, folded proteins, even those reaching 10 microseconds in length, may provide relatively little information that can be used to modify torsion parameters to achieve an accurate balance between different secondary structural elements."
https://openalex.org/W1978116622,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS, endotoxin, pyrogen) constitutes a very troubling contaminant of crude phage lysates produced in Gram-negative bacteria. Toxicity of LPS depends on the strong innate immunity response including the cytokines. Therefore, its removal is important for bacteriophage applications. In this paper, we present a procedure for extractive removal of endotoxin from bacteriophage preparations with water immiscible solvents (1-octanol or 1-butanol). During extraction most of the phage lytic activity is retained in the aqueous phase, while endotoxin accumulates in the organic solvent. The levels of endotoxin (expressed as endotoxin units, EU) in the aqueous bacteriophage-containing fraction determined by limulus amebocyte lysate or EndoLISA assay were exceptionally low. While the initial endotoxin levels in the crude phage lysates ranged between 103 and 105 EU/ml the average level after organic extraction remaining in the aqueous fraction was 5.3 EU/ml. These values when related to phage titers decreased from 103-105 EU/109 PFU (plaque forming units) down to an average of 2.8 EU/109 PFU. The purification procedure is scalable, efficient and applicable to all the bacteriophages tested: T4, HAP1 (E. coli) and F8 (P. aeruginosa)."

https://openalex.org/W2067338512,"The anti-inflammatory mechanisms of the sulfated polysaccharidic fraction obtained from red marine alga Gracilaria cornea (Gc-FI) were investigated using a paw edema model induced in rats by different inflammatory agents (carrageenan, dextran, serotonin, bradykinin, compound 48/80 or L-arginine). Gc-FI at the doses of 3, 9 or 27 mg/kg, subcutaneously - s.c., significantly inhibited rat paw edema induced by carrageenan and dextran, as confirmed by myeloperoxidase and Evans’ blue assessments, respectively. Gc-FI (9 mg/kg, s.c.) inhibited rat paw edema induced by histamine, compound 48/80 and L-arginine. Additionally, Gc-FI (9 mg/kg, s.c.) inhibited Cg-induced edema in animals with intact mast cells but did not inhibit that with degranulated mast cells by compound 48/80, revealing a protective role on mast cell membranes. Gc-FI down-regulated the IL-1β, TNF-α and COX-2 mRNA and protein levels compared with those of the carrageenan group, based on qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry analyses. After inhibition with ZnPP IX, a specific heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) inhibitor, the anti-inflammatory effect of Gc-FI was not observed in Cg-induced paw edema, suggesting that the anti-inflammatory effect of Gc-FI is, in part, dependent on the integrity of the HO-1 pathway. Gc-FI can target a combination of multiple points involved in inflammatory phenomena."

In this study, we examined the mechanism for its degradation using purified Pah1 and isolated proteasomes. Pah1 expressed in S. cerevisiae or Escherichia coli was not degraded by the 26S proteasome, but by its catalytic 20S core particle, indicating that its degradation is ubiquitin-independent. The degradation of Pah1 by the 20S proteasome was dependent on time and proteasome concentration at the pH optimum of 7.0. The 20S proteasomal degradation was conserved for human lipin 1 phosphatidate phosphatase. The degradation analysis using Pah1 truncations and its fusion with GFP indicated that proteolysis initiates at the N- and C-terminal unfolded regions. The folded region of Pah1, in particular the haloacid dehalogenase-like domain containing the DIDGT catalytic sequence, was resistant to the proteasomal degradation. The structural change of Pah1, as reflected by electrophoretic mobility shift, occurs through its phosphorylation by Pho85-Pho80, and the phosphorylation sites are located within its N- and C-terminal unfolded regions. Phosphorylation of Pah1 by Pho85-Pho80 inhibited its degradation, extending its half-life by ∼2-fold. The dephosphorylation of endogenously phosphorylated Pah1 by the Nem1-Spo7 protein phosphatase, which is highly specific for the sites phosphorylated by Pho85-Pho80, stimulated the 20S proteasomal degradation and reduced its half-life by 2.6-fold.

Hydrolysis of plasma triglycerides by LPL can be disrupted by the protein angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4), and ANGPTL4 has been shown to inactivate LPL in vitro. However, in vivo LPL is often complexed to glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high density lipoprotein-binding protein 1 (GPIHBP1) on the surface of capillary endothelial cells. GPIHBP1 is responsible for trafficking LPL across capillary endothelial cells and anchors LPL to the capillary wall during lipolysis. How ANGPTL4 interacts with LPL in this context is not known. In this study, we investigated the interactions of ANGPTL4 with LPL-GPIHBP1 complexes on the surface of endothelial cells. We show that ANGPTL4 was capable of binding and inactivating LPL complexed to GPIHBP1 on the surface of endothelial cells. Once inactivated, LPL dissociated from GPIHBP1. We also show that ANGPTL4-inactivated LPL was incapable of binding GPIHBP1. ANGPTL4 was capable of binding, but not inactivating, LPL at 4 °C, suggesting that binding alone was not sufficient for ANGPTL4's inhibitory activity. We observed that although the N-terminal coiled-coil domain of ANGPTL4 by itself and full-length ANGPTL4 both bound with similar affinities to LPL, the N-terminal fragment was more potent in inactivating both free and GPIHBP1-bound LPL. These results led us to conclude that ANGPTL4 can both bind and inactivate LPL complexed to GPIHBP1 and that inactivation of LPL by ANGPTL4 greatly reduces the affinity of LPL for GPIHBP1.Background: Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) function is modified by interactions with its transporter GPIHBP1 and the inhibitor angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4).Results: ANGPTL4 inactivated GPIHBP1-bound LPL.

https://openalex.org/W2061599085,"Binding of α5β1 and αvβ3/β5 integrin receptors on the endothelium to their fibronectin substrate in the extracellular matrix has been targeted as a possible means of blocking tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth. However, clinical trials of blocking antibodies and peptides have been disappointing despite promising preclinical results, leading to questions about the mechanism of the inhibitors and the reasons for their failure. Here, using tissue-specific and inducible genetics to delete the α5 and αv receptors in the endothelium or their fibronectin substrate, either in the endothelium or globally, we show that both are dispensable for tumor growth, in transplanted tumors as well as spontaneous and angiogenesis-dependent RIP-Tag-driven pancreatic adenocarcinomas. In the nearly complete absence of fibronectin, no differences in vascular density or the deposition of basement membrane laminins, ColIV, Nid1, Nid2, or the TGFβ binding matrix proteins, fibrillin-1 and -2, could be observed. Our results reveal that fibronectin and the endothelial fibronectin receptor subunits, α5 and αv, are dispensable for tumor angiogenesis, suggesting that the inhibition of angiogenesis induced by antibodies or small molecules may occur through a dominant negative effect, rather than a simple functional block."

https://openalex.org/W2003284471,"Rising concentrations of nitrous oxide (N2O) in the atmosphere are causing widespread concern because this trace gas plays a key role in the destruction of stratospheric ozone and it is a strong greenhouse gas. The successful mitigation of N2O emissions requires a solid understanding of the relative importance of all N2O sources and sinks. Stable isotope ratio measurements (δ15N-N2O and δ18O-N2O), including the intramolecular distribution of 15N (site preference), are one way to track different sources if they are isotopically distinct. ‘Top-down’ isotope mass-balance studies have had limited success balancing the global N2O budget thus far because the isotopic signatures of soil, freshwater, and marine sources are poorly constrained and a comprehensive analysis of global N2O stable isotope measurements has not been done. Here we used a robust analysis of all available in situ measurements to define key global N2O sources. We showed that the marine source is isotopically distinct from soil and freshwater N2O (the continental source). Further, the global average source (sum of all natural and anthropogenic sources) is largely controlled by soils and freshwaters. These findings substantiate past modelling studies that relied on several assumptions about the global N2O cycle. Finally, a two-box-model and a Bayesian isotope mixing model revealed marine and continental N2O sources have relative contributions of 24–26% and 74–76% to the total, respectively. Further, the Bayesian modeling exercise indicated the N2O flux from freshwaters may be much larger than currently thought."
https://openalex.org/W1980670479,"Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), including gefitinib, are effective for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with EGFR mutations. However, these patients eventually develop resistance to EGFR-TKI. The goal of the present study was to investigate the involvement of autophagy in gefitinib resistance. We developed gefitinib-resistant cells (PC-9/gef) from PC-9 cells (containing exon 19 deletion EGFR) after long-term exposure in gefitinib. PC-9/gef cells (B4 and E3) were 200-fold more resistant to gefitinib than PC-9/wt cells. Compared with PC-9/wt cells, both PC-9/gefB4 and PC-9/gefE3 cells demonstrated higher basal LC3-II levels which were inhibited by 3-methyladenine (3-MA, an autophagy inhibitor) and potentiated by chloroquine (CQ, an inhibitor of autophagolysosomes formation), indicating elevated autophagy in PC-9/gef cells. 3-MA and CQ concentration-dependently inhibited cell survival of both PC-9wt and PC-9/gef cells, suggesting that autophagy may be pro-survival. Furthermore, gefitinib increased LC3-II levels and autolysosome formation in both PC-9/wt cells and PC-9/gef cells. In PC-9/wt cells, CQ potentiated the cytotoxicity by low gefitinib (3nM). Moreover, CQ overcame the acquired gefitinib resistance in PC-9/gef cells by enhancing gefitinib-induced cytotoxicity, activation of caspase 3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. Using an in vivo model xenografting with PC-9/wt and PC-9/gefB4 cells, oral administration of gefitinib (50 mg/kg) completely inhibited the tumor growth of PC-9/wt but not PC-9/gefB4cells. Combination of CQ (75 mg/kg, i.p.) and gefitinib was more effective than gefitinib alone in reducing the tumor growth of PC-9/gefB4. Our data suggest that inhibition of autophagy may be a therapeutic strategy to overcome acquired resistance of gefitinib in EGFR mutation NSCLC patients."
https://openalex.org/W1974343039,"Covalent cross-linking of fibrin chains is required for stable blood clot formation, which is catalyzed by coagulation factor XIII (FXIII), a proenzyme of plasma transglutaminase consisting of catalytic A (FXIII-A) and non-catalytic B subunits (FXIII-B). Herein, we demonstrate that FXIII-B accelerates fibrin cross-linking. Depletion of FXIII-B from normal plasma supplemented with a physiological level of recombinant FXIII-A resulted in delayed fibrin cross-linking, reduced incorporation of FXIII-A into fibrin clots, and impaired activation peptide cleavage by thrombin; the addition of recombinant FXIII-B restored normal fibrin cross-linking, FXIII-A incorporation into fibrin clots, and activation peptide cleavage by thrombin. Immunoprecipitation with an anti-fibrinogen antibody revealed an interaction between the FXIII heterotetramer and fibrinogen mediated by FXIII-B and not FXIII-A. FXIII-B probably binds the γ-chain of fibrinogen with its D-domain, which is near the fibrin polymerization pockets, and dissociates from fibrin during or after cross-linking between γ-chains. Thus, FXIII-B plays important roles in the formation of a ternary complex between proenzyme FXIII, prosubstrate fibrinogen, and activator thrombin. Accordingly, congenital or acquired FXIII-B deficiency may result in increased bleeding tendency through impaired fibrin stabilization due to decreased FXIII-A activation by thrombin and secondary FXIII-A deficiency arising from enhanced circulatory clearance.Background: The B subunit of factor XIII (FXIII-B) was previously thought to inhibit fibrin cross-linking by preventing thrombin-mediated activation of the A subunit (FXIII-A).Results: FXIII-B accelerated FXIII-A activation and subsequent fibrin cross-linking by formation of an FXIII-A, fibrinogen, and thrombin ternary complex.Conclusion: FXIII-B accelerated fibrin cross-linking.Significance: FXIII-B deficiency leads to impaired fibrin stabilization.

Depletion of FXIII-B from normal plasma supplemented with a physiological level of recombinant FXIII-A resulted in delayed fibrin cross-linking, reduced incorporation of FXIII-A into fibrin clots, and impaired activation peptide cleavage by thrombin; the addition of recombinant FXIII-B restored normal fibrin cross-linking, FXIII-A incorporation into fibrin clots, and activation peptide cleavage by thrombin. Immunoprecipitation with an anti-fibrinogen antibody revealed an interaction between the FXIII heterotetramer and fibrinogen mediated by FXIII-B and not FXIII-A. FXIII-B probably binds the γ-chain of fibrinogen with its D-domain, which is near the fibrin polymerization pockets, and dissociates from fibrin during or after cross-linking between γ-chains. Thus, FXIII-B plays important roles in the formation of a ternary complex between proenzyme FXIII, prosubstrate fibrinogen, and activator thrombin. Accordingly, congenital or acquired FXIII-B deficiency may result in increased bleeding tendency through impaired fibrin stabilization due to decreased FXIII-A activation by thrombin and secondary FXIII-A deficiency arising from enhanced circulatory clearance. Background: The B subunit of factor XIII (FXIII-B) was previously thought to inhibit fibrin cross-linking by preventing thrombin-mediated activation of the A subunit (FXIII-A). Results: FXIII-B accelerated FXIII-A activation and subsequent fibrin cross-linking by formation of an FXIII-A, fibrinogen, and thrombin ternary complex. Conclusion: FXIII-B accelerated fibrin cross-linking. Significance: FXIII-B deficiency leads to impaired fibrin stabilization."

Here, we use mangrove propagules with a wide variety of morphologies to investigate the interaction between water and wind as a driver of passive dispersal. We imposed 16 combinations of wind and hydrodynamic conditions in a flume tank, using propagules of six important mangrove species (and genera), resulting in a set of dispersal morphologies that covers most variation present in mangrove propagules worldwide. Additionally, we discussed the broader implications of the outcome of this flume study on the potential of long distance dispersal for mangrove propagules in nature, applying a conceptual model to a natural mangrove system in Gazi Bay (Kenya). Overall, the effect of wind on dispersal depended on propagule density (g l-1). The low-density Heritiera littoralis propagules were most affected by wind, while the high-density vertically floating propagules of Ceriops tagal and Bruguiera gymnorrhiza were least affected. Avicennia marina, and horizontally floating Rhizophora mucronata and C. tagal propagules behaved similarly. Morphological propagule traits, such as the dorsal sail of H. littoralis, explained another part of the interspecific differences. Within species, differences in dispersal velocities can be explained by differences in density and for H. littoralis also by variations in the shape of the dorsal sail. Our conceptual model illustrates that different propagule types have a different likelihood of reaching the open ocean depending on prevailing water and wind currents. Results suggest that in open water, propagule traits (density, morphology, and floating orientation) appear to determine the effect of water and wind currents on dispersal dynamics. This has important implications for inter- and intraspecific variation in dispersal patterns and the likelihood of reaching suitable habitat patches within a propagule's viable period."

In its active form, MDM2 forms homodimers as well as heterodimers with the homologous protein murine double minute 4 (MDMX), both of which are thought to occur through their respective C-terminal RING (really interesting new gene) domains. In this study, using multiple MDM2 mutants, we show evidence suggesting that MDM2 homo- and heterodimerization occur through distinct mechanisms because MDM2 RING domain mutations that inhibit MDM2 interaction with MDMX do not affect MDM2 interaction with WT MDM2. Intriguingly, deletion of a portion of the MDM2 central acidic domain selectively inhibits interaction with MDM2 while leaving intact the ability of MDM2 to interact with MDMX and to ubiquitinate p53. Further analysis of an MDM2 C-terminal deletion mutant reveals that the C-terminal residues of MDM2 are required for both MDM2 and MDMX interaction. Collectively, our results suggest a model in which MDM2-MDMX heterodimerization requires the extreme C terminus and proper RING domain structure of MDM2, whereas MDM2 homodimerization requires the extreme C terminus and the central acidic domain of MDM2, suggesting that MDM2 homo- and heterodimers utilize distinct MDM2 domains.

https://openalex.org/W2032132846,"Oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC) has a high mortality rate and the incidence is rising worldwide. Despite advances in treatment, the disease lacks specific prognostic markers and treatment modality. The spreading of OTSCC is dependent on the tumor microenvironment and involves tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Although the presence of TAMs is associated with poor prognosis in OTSCC, the specific mechanisms underlying this are still unknown. The aim here was to investigate the effect of macrophages (Mfs) on HSC-3 tongue carcinoma cells and NF-kappaB activity. We polarized THP-1 cells to M1 (inflammatory), M2 (TAM-like) and R848 (imidazoquinoline-treated) type Mfs. We then investigated the effect of Mfs on HSC-3 cell migration and NF-kappaB activity, cytokine production and invasion using several different in vitro migration models, a human 3D tissue invasion model, antibody arrays, confocal microscopy, immunohistochemistry and a mouse invasion model. We found that in co-culture studies all types of Mfs fused with HSC-3 cells, a process which was partially due to efferocytosis. HSC-3 cells induced expression of epidermal growth factor and transforming growth factor-beta in co-cultures with M2 Mfs. Direct cell-cell contact between M2 Mfs and HSC-3 cells induced migration and invasion of HSC-3 cells while M1 Mfs reduced HSC-3 cell invasion. M2 Mfs had an excess of NF-kappaB p50 subunit and a lack of p65 subunits both in the presence and absence of HSC-3 cells, indicating dysregulation and pro-tumorigenic NF-kappaB activation. TAM-like cells were abundantly present in close vicinity to carcinoma cells in OTSCC patient samples. We conclude that M2 Mfs/TAMs have an important role in OTSCC regulating adhesion, migration, invasion and cytokine production of carcinoma cells favouring tumor growth. These results demonstrate that OTSCC patients could benefit from therapies targeting TAMs, polarizing TAM-like M2 Mfs to inflammatory macrophages and modulating NF-kappaB activity."
https://openalex.org/W2007456133,"Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 1 (NOD1) and NOD2 are cytosolic pattern recognition receptors playing pivotal roles in innate immune signaling. NOD1 and NOD2 recognize bacterial peptidoglycan derivatives iE-DAP and MDP, respectively and undergoes conformational alternation and ATP-dependent self-oligomerization of NACHT domain followed by downstream signaling. Lack of structural adequacy of NACHT domain confines our understanding about the NOD-mediated signaling mechanism. Here, we predicted the structure of NACHT domain of both NOD1 and NOD2 from model organism zebrafish (Danio rerio) using computational methods. Our study highlighted the differential ATP binding modes in NOD1 and NOD2. In NOD1, γ-phosphate of ATP faced toward the central nucleotide binding cavity like NLRC4, whereas in NOD2 the cavity was occupied by adenine moiety. The conserved 'Lysine' at Walker A formed hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) and Aspartic acid (Walker B) formed electrostatic interaction with ATP. At Sensor 1, Arg328 of NOD1 exhibited an H-bond with ATP, whereas corresponding Arg404 of NOD2 did not. 'Proline' of GxP motif (Pro386 of NOD1 and Pro464 of NOD2) interacted with adenine moiety and His511 at Sensor 2 of NOD1 interacted with γ-phosphate group of ATP. In contrast, His579 of NOD2 interacted with the adenine moiety having a relatively inverted orientation. Our findings are well supplemented with the molecular interaction of ATP with NLRC4, and consistent with mutagenesis data reported for human, which indicates evolutionary shared NOD signaling mechanism. Together, this study provides novel insights into ATP binding mechanism, and highlights the differential ATP binding modes in zebrafish NOD1 and NOD2."
https://openalex.org/W2074159558,"We advance a theory-driven approach to stereotype structure, informed by connectionist theories of cognition. Whereas traditional models define or tacitly assume that stereotypes possess inherently Group → Attribute activation directionality (e.g., Black activates criminal), our model predicts heterogeneous stereotype directionality. Alongside the classically studied Group → Attribute stereotypes, some stereotypes should be bidirectional (i.e., Group ⇄ Attribute) and others should have Attribute → Group unidirectionality (e.g., fashionable activates gay). We tested this prediction in several large-scale studies with human participants (NCombined = 4,817), assessing stereotypic inferences among various groups and attributes. Supporting predictions, we found heterogeneous directionality both among the stereotype links related to a given social group and also between the links of different social groups. These efforts yield rich datasets that map the networks of stereotype links related to several social groups. We make these datasets publicly available, enabling other researchers to explore a number of questions related to stereotypes and stereotyping. Stereotype directionality is an understudied feature of stereotypes and stereotyping with widespread implications for the development, measurement, maintenance, expression, and change of stereotypes, stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination."

Upon activation by TGF-β, receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads), Smad2 and Smad3, form a heteromeric complex with co-Smad (Smad4) and translocate into the nucleus where the complex regulates the transcription of target genes by recruiting other co-regulators (2.Yan X. Liu Z. Chen Y. Regulation of TGF-β signaling by Smad7.Acta Biochim. Biophys. Sin. 2009; 41: 263-272Crossref Scopus (310) Google Scholar).

In both experiments pBIND having Renilla luciferase was also transfected and used as transfection control. pGL3-Smad7 Firefly luciferase activity was normalized against Renilla luciferase, and the normalized luciferase activities (relative light units) were plotted as the average (±S.D.) of triplicate samples from typical experiments (SigmaPlot). Total RNA was isolated from in vitro differentiated T cells or mononuclear cells isolated from the mice brain by the TRIzol method, and 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed with the Verso cDNA Synthesis kit (Thermo Scientific) according to manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was amplified with gene-specific primers using the DyNAmo ColorFlash SYBR Green R kit (Thermo Scientific) and 18 S mRNA as a control. The relative -fold change was calculated by using the formula 2−ΔΔCt. Cell lysates were prepared by treating cells with cell lysis buffer; protein levels in the samples were estimated in a Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). For immunoblotting, 30 μg of total protein extract was resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P; Millipore). Membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk and incubated overnight with primary antibodies followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. The blots were developed with Luminata Forte Western HRP substrate (Millipore). For flow cytometry all antibodies were used according to manufacturer instructions and titrated as required. Staining of cell surface markers CD4, CD44, and CD62L was performed as described previously (25.Chandra V. Mahajan S. Saini A. Dkhar H.K. Nanduri R. Raj E.B. Kumar A. Gupta P. Human IL10 gene repression by Rev-erbα ameliorates Mycobacterium tuberculosis clearance.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 10692-10702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Intracellular and nuclear staining was performed for IL17A, IFNγ, and Foxp3 according to manufacturer instructions (Intracellular Fixation and Permeabilization Buffer Set, Foxp3/Transcription Factor Buffer Set; eBioscience). All samples were acquired by gating on CD4 cells. Samples were acquired on BD FACSAria and analyzed by using FlowJo software. ELISA for IL10 (BD Bioscience) was used to analyze supernatants from 3–4-day cultures. ChIP and re-ChIP was performed as described previously (26.Lambert J.R. Nordeen S.K. Analysis of steroid hormone-induced histone acetylation by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay.Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 176: 273-281PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 106 cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde, and the reaction was quenched with 125 mm glycine. The samples were washed twice with ice-cold 1× PBS and then dissolved in 200 μl of SDS lysis buffer. The cells were sonicated to obtain the appropriate lengths of DNA fragments. Immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-VDR, anti-RXR, anti-phospho-Smad3 (p-Smad3), and anti-HDAC2 antibodies. The immune complexes were collected by centrifugation and washed with low salt wash buffer, high salt wash buffer, LiCl wash buffer, and finally with 1× Tris-EDTA. The immunoprecipitated DNA was eluted in elution buffer and purified by ethanol precipitation, and the purified DNA was amplified with Smad7 promoter-specific primers. The following primers were used in the ChIP assay: mouse GAPDH promoter forward (5′-ACCAGGGAGGGCTGCAGTCC-3′) and reverse (5′-TCAGTTCGGAGCCCACACGC-3′); Smad7 promoter vitamin D response element (VDRE) forward (5′-TATCCTCAGACCTGCTCCAC-3′ and reverse 5′-AGCCAGCAGACCTGCTTA-3′). Primers corresponding to Smad binding element (SBE) on Smad7 promoter are forward (5′-TCTTCCGATTTCCCCCTG-3′) and reverse (5′-TCCCTCTGCTCGGCTGGTT-3′). Primers spanning the BamH I site, which lies in between the VDRE and SBE on Smad7 promoter, are forward (5′-TTCTCCAGGCAGTCCTAGAA-3′) and reverse (5′-GGTTAGTGGCCCGATTTAG-3′). 5′-End labeling of annealed oligonucleotides was performed with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and [γ-32P]ATP. pFLAG-mVDR and pFLAG-mRXR plasmids were transcribed and translated using the TNT Quick Coupled Transcription Translation System according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA binding to recombinant proteins was assessed usingminimal amounts of probe as described earlier (25.Chandra V. Mahajan S. Saini A. Dkhar H.K. Nanduri R. Raj E.B. Kumar A. Gupta P. Human IL10 gene repression by Rev-erbα ameliorates Mycobacterium tuberculosis clearance.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 10692-10702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For competition experiments, a molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide was added to compete out the DNA binding. Gel shift immunoassays were performed with 0.4 μg of anti-VDR antibody (Thermo Scientific) or 0.4 μg of anti-RXR antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The oligonucleotide sequence corresponding to the site −1031 to −1046 on Smad7 promoter (5′-GAAGGAATAAACTCTCTGACCCTAAGCAGG-3′ and 5′-CCTGCTTAGGGTCAGAGAGTTTATTCCTTC-3′) were used as a test. Mouse osteopontin oligonucleotides 5′-GATCCACAAGGTTCACGAGGTTCACGTCTG-3′ and 5′-CAGACGTGAACCTCGTGAACCTTGTGGATC-3′ were used as positive control. Negative control sequences were also attempted to rule out nonspecific binding. Mutant oligonucleotide 5′-GAAGGAATAAACTCTCTGAAAATAAGCAGG-3′ and 5′-CCTGCTTATTTTCAGAGAGTTTATTCCTTC-3′ were also used for performing EMSA. EAE was induced in 8-week-old C57BL/6 female mice by subcutaneous injection at 2 sites with 100 μl of an emulsion containing 100 μg of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) peptide (amino acids 33–55) in complete Freund's adjuvant. 200 ng of pertussis toxin was injected intraperitoneally on the day of immunization and 2 days thereafter. From day 4, mice received on alternate days either 300 ng of 1,25(OH)2D3 in soybean oil or vehicle (control) intraperitoneally until the disease progression reached its peak. The mice were scored daily for clinical signs of EAE on the basis of the following scale: 0 = no clinical sign, 1 = loss of tail tonicity, 2 = flaccid tail, 3 = partial hind limb paralysis, 4 = total hind limb paralysis, and 5 = fore and hind limb paralysis. Spleen and lymph nodes were collected from mice, and single cell suspensions were prepared. These cells were re-stimulated with 20 μg of MOG peptide before intracellular staining. Mono nuclear cells were isolated from brain by Percoll gradient (30%:70%) as mentioned in previous literature (27.Spanier J.A. Nashold F.E. Olson J.K. Hayes C.E.

Two-tailed Student's t tests were performed to obtain p values. Statistical significance was established at p < 0.05 (*). Although previous studies have highlighted the significant role played by Smad proteins in Treg- and Th17-cell development (11.Martinez G.J. Zhang Z. Chung Y. Reynolds J.M. Lin X. Jetten A.M.

Immunol. 2010; 185: 842-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), the related expression of Smads in these cells has not been studied. In this work we examined the relative expression of effector Smads in Treg and Th17 cells differentiated from naïve CD4 T lymphocytes isolated from mice, and real time qPCR analyses were performed to determine the expression levels of Smad2, Smad3, Smad4, and Smad7 in Treg and Th17 cells compared with those in naïve CD4+ T lymphocytes cultured in the presence of IL-2 (Th0) (Fig. 1A). Compared with Treg cells, Th17 cells expressed significantly less Smad3, although the expression of Smad7 was significantly elevated in Th17 cells. The significant expression of Smad3 in Tregs and of Smad7 in Th17 suggests of a functional role of these Smad proteins in these cell types. 1,25(OH)2D3 has been shown to inhibit Th17 cells differentiation, but the mechanism is not fully understood (30.Chang J.H. Cha H.R. Lee D.S. Seo K.Y. Kweon M.N. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 inhibits the differentiation and migration of T(H)17 cells to protect against experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e12925Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). 1,25(OH)2D3 has been reported to suppress Th17 function by restricting the expression of IL17 (31.Joshi S. Pantalena L.C. Liu X.K. Gaffen S.L. Liu H. Rohowsky-Kochan C. Ichiyama K. Yoshimura A. Steinman L. Christakos S. Youssef S. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 ameliorates Th17 autoimmunity via transcriptional modulation of interleukin-17A.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2011; 31: 3653-3669Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Here we examined the possible participation of Smad proteins in 1,25(OH)2D3-mediated inhibition of Th17 cell differentiation. We used qPCR to investigate the effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 on the expression of Smads in naïve T cells cultured in the presence of TGF-β and IL6 with or without 1,25(OH)2D3. Treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 induces the expression of Smad3 while at the same time suppressing the expression of Smad7 in these cells (Fig. 1B). This treatment also induced the expression of VDR, Foxp3, and suppressed the expression of il17a (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, we evaluated the role of VDR in the 1,25(OH)2D3-mediated modulation of Smad3 and Smad7 expression in a VDR-knockdown background (Fig. 1D). Interestingly, 1,25(OH)2D3 modulation of these Smads was abrogated in the knockdown background of VDR. Hence, it is clear that 1,25(OH)2D3 modulates Smad3 and Smad7 gene expression via VDR (Fig. 1D). A similar pattern was also observed for Smad3, p-Smad3, and Smad7 protein levels (Fig. 1E). To elucidate whether VDR modulates Smad expression through a genomic mechanism, a bioinformatics search for the presence of a VDRE was performed on the proximal promoters of Smad3 and Smad7 by using NubiScan and also validated manually (32.Podvinec M.

We found a putative VDRE at position −1031 to −1046 from the transcription start site on the minus strand of Smad7 promoter; however, we could not identify any VDRE on the Smad3 promoter (Fig. 2A) (33.Russell J.

https://openalex.org/W2110803384,"Recent genome wide association studies have linked tribbles pseudokinase 1 (TRIB1) to the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). Based on the observations that increased expression of TRIB1 reduces secretion of VLDL and is associated with lower plasma levels of LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, higher plasma levels of HDL cholesterol and reduced risk for myocardial infarction, we carried out a high throughput phenotypic screen based on quantitative RT-PCR assay to identify compounds that induce TRIB1 expression in human HepG2 hepatoma cells. In a screen of a collection of diversity-oriented synthesis (DOS)-derived compounds, we identified a series of benzofuran-based compounds that upregulate TRIB1 expression and phenocopy the effects of TRIB1 cDNA overexpression, as they inhibit triglyceride synthesis and apoB secretion in cells. In addition, the compounds downregulate expression of MTTP and APOC3, key components of the lipoprotein assembly pathway. However, CRISPR-Cas9 induced chromosomal disruption of the TRIB1 locus in HepG2 cells, while confirming its regulatory role in lipoprotein metabolism, demonstrated that the effects of benzofurans persist in TRIB1-null cells indicating that TRIB1 is sufficient but not necessary to transmit the effects of the drug. Remarkably, active benzofurans, as well as natural products capable of TRIB1 upregulation, also modulate hepatic cell cholesterol metabolism by elevating the expression of LDLR transcript and LDL receptor protein, while reducing the levels of PCSK9 transcript and secreted PCSK9 protein and stimulating LDL uptake. The effects of benzofurans are not masked by cholesterol depletion and are independent of the SREBP-2 regulatory circuit, indicating that these compounds represent a novel class of chemically tractable small-molecule modulators that shift cellular lipoprotein metabolism in HepG2 cells from lipogenesis to scavenging."

However, the functional significance of such phosphorylation seems to be context-dependent and largely remains unknown. We previously demonstrated that Chk1 interacts with the MCM complex (25.Han X. Aslanian A. Fu K. Tsuji T. Zhang Y. The interaction between checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) and the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) complex is required for DNA damage-induced Chk1 phosphorylation.J.

Here we report that human Chk1 phosphorylates MCM3 mainly at Ser-205, and this phosphorylation keeps normal DNA replication under control through negatively controlling the replication fork progression. Replicative stress induces Chk1 phosphorylation followed by its release from chromatin where Ser-205 phosphorylation of MCM3 mainly occurs. As a result, the level of Ser-205 phosphorylated MCM3 is reduced by replicative stress. The reduction in Ser-205 phosphorylation of MCM3 is accompanied with the generation of long stretches of single strand DNA (ssDNA), the critical platform for maximal activation of ATR. This seems to be important for subsequent Chk1 phosphorylation and likely the amplification and maintenance of replication checkpoint. HEK293T, HeLa, U2-OS, and A549 cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). HEK293T cells were transfected with calcium phosphate, whereas other cell lines were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) or X-tremeGENE (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturers' protocols.

HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing differently tagged MCM constructs for 48 h, lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm DTT, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40), and sonicated. The supernatants were immunoprecipitated (IPed) with anti-HA antibodies overnight and collected with Protein A/G beads (Thermo Scientific). The beads were incubated with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (CIAP; New England Biolabs) at 37 °C for 1 h and then used as the substrate to incubate with His-Chk1 purified from baculovirus sf9 cells. The in vitro kinase reaction was assembled in reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 25 mm β-glycerol phosphatase, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm DTT) with or without 10 mm ATP for 30 min at 37 °C.

A scale bar was taken under the same condition (100× oil lens). We focused on the second track that is stained with the green color as it represents ongoing DNA replication forks. The length of the DNA replication track was calibrated by using NIH ImageJ software and adjusted by a scale bar of 10 μm. The experiments were performed two times in duplicate. A minimum of 100 tracks was measured in each duplicate. Data represent median and S.D. HA-MCM3 WT or mutants underwent in vitro phosphorylation by His-Chk1, were separated by SDS-PAGE, and were Coomassie-stained. The bands were excised and in-gel trypsin-digested, and peptides were extracted with 50% acetonitrile in 5% formic acid and then resuspended in 0.1% formic acid. The analysis of the resulting peptides was performed with an Orbitrap Elite hybrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron, San Jose, CA) equipped with a Waters nanoACQUITY UPLC system (Waters, Taunton, MA). Spectra were recorded by data-dependent methods with an alternative full scan followed by 20 MS/MS scans. Data were analyzed using Mascot Daemon (Matrix Science, Boston, MA) with a setting of 10 ppm for parent ions and 0.8 Da for product ions. Carbamidomethylation of Cys residues was set as a fixed modification, and oxidation of Met and phosphorylation on Ser, Thr, and Tyr residues were set as variable modifications. Phosphorylation sites were further verified by manual examination of each tandem mass spectrum of phosphopeptides. We recently reported that Chk1 interacts with the MCM complex in cells (25.Han X.

Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 24716-24723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Because Chk1 is a Ser/Thr protein kinase, which preferentially phosphorylates proteins at RXX(S/T) sites similarly to PKA (3.Zhang Y. Hunter T. Roles of Chk1 in cell biology and cancer therapy.Int. J. Cancer. 2014; 134: 1013-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 32.Chen P. Luo C. Deng Y. Ryan K. Register J. Margosiak S. Tempczyk-Russell A. Nguyen B. Myers P. Lundgren K. Kan C.C.

The 1.7 Å crystal structure of human cell cycle checkpoint kinase Chk1: implications for Chk1 regulation.Cell. 2000; 100: 681-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), we asked whether Chk1 could phosphorylate any member of the MCM complex. To this end, we overexpressed tagged MCM proteins in HEK293T cells, IPed with antibodies against the corresponding tag, and treated the IP beads with CIAP to remove pre-existing phosphorylation events. We used the dephosphorylated beads as the substrate and His-Chk1 purified from baculovirus as the kinase to perform the in vitro kinase assay. A fragment of Cdc25C containing a known Chk1 phosphorylation site, Ser-216, fused to GST was used as the positive control. To detect any potential phosphorylation signal of MCMs, we used a mixture of phospho-Ser/Thr antibodies (containing an equal ratio of anti-Ser(P)-216-Cdc25C, the known Chk1 target; anti-RRX(pS/pT) (where pS is phosphoserine and pT is phosphothreonine), the substrate for PKA; pan-anti-Ser(P)/Thr(P); and anti-Tyr(P)/Thr(P)-Cdc2). This antibody mixture readily detected phosphorylation of Cdc25C (Fig. 1A, lane 14). Remarkably, we observed that MCM3 and to a much lesser extent MCM4, -5, and -7 were phosphorylated (Fig. 1A, lane 10). We also detected phosphorylation of non-MCM proteins (e.g. the band marked with an asterisk in Fig. 1, A and C), likely coming from IP, by Chk1 or associating kinases. We noticed that MCM3 proteins were already phosphorylated in cells (Fig. 1B, without CIAP treatment). However, the level of phospho-MCM3 in cells was much lower than that from the in vitro kinase reaction (Fig. 1C, lanes 1 and 5, between short and long exposure, indicated by the arrow), suggesting that Chk1 robustly phosphorylates MCM3 in vitro. To determine whether the observed MCM3 phosphorylation is dependent on Chk1, we pretreated His-Chk1 proteins with a specific Chk1 inhibitor, PF-003946901 (33.Zhang Y.W. Brognard J. Coughlin C. You Z. Dolled-Filhart M. Aslanian A. Manning G. Abraham R.T. Hunter T. The F box protein Fbx6 regulates Chk1 stability and cellular sensitivity to replication stress.Mol. Cell. 2009; 35: 442-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), prior to the in vitro kinase reaction. The results showed that phosphorylation of MCM3 was significantly reduced by the Chk1 inhibitor (Fig. 1C, lanes 5 and 6, short exposure, band indicated by the arrow). The inhibitor did inhibit the catalytic activity of Chk1 as indicated by the disappearance of the slow migrating band of His-Chk1 arising from its own autophosphorylation (Fig. 1C, lanes 5 and 6, the anti-Chk1 blot, band denoted by the arrowhead). To further confirm that MCM3 phosphorylation is dependent on the catalytic activity of Chk1, we carried out in vitro kinase assays using either WT or kinase-dead D148A Chk1 proteins as the kinase. The results showed that, unlike the WT, the kinase-dead Chk1 failed to phosphorylate MCM3 (Fig. 2A), suggesting that MCM3 phosphorylation is dependent on the catalytic activity of Chk1. To confirm these results in vivo, we treated HEK293T cells expressing HA-MCM3 WT with the Chk1 inhibitor and examined MCM3 phosphorylation by immunoblotting. The results showed that the Chk1 inhibitor reduced phosphorylation of HA-MCM3 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). Such reduction was not due to inhibition of expression of Chk1 or HA-MCM3 proteins (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, the level of phosphorylated endogenous MCM3 protein was also reduced by the Chk1 inhibitor (Fig. 2C). To confirm the effect of the Chk1 inhibitor in cell culture, we monitored the protein level of a known downstream cell cycle target of Chk1, Cdc25A. Cdc25A undergoes Chk1-dependent phosphorylation followed by proteasome-dependent degradation (34.S⊘rensen C.S. Syljuåsen R.G. Falck J. Schroeder T. Rönnstrand L. Khanna K.K. Zhou B.B. Bartek J. Lukas J. Chk1 regulates the S phase checkpoint by coupling the physiological turnover and ionizing radiation-induced accelerated proteolysis of Cdc25A.Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 247-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Thus, if Chk1 is inhibited, we expected to observe an increase in the protein level of Cdc25A. Our data showed that this is indeed the case (Figs. 2, B and C). To preclude the possibility that such changes were due to altered cell cycle distribution by the Chk1 inhibitor, we monitored the cell cycle profile in the presence of the Chk1 inhibitor. The results did not reveal an obvious cell cycle change even after 12 h of Chk1 inhibitor treatment (Fig. 2D). We also noticed that the Chk1 inhibitor did not completely block MCM3 phosphorylation, suggesting that other kinases might also phosphorylate MCM3 albeit to a much lesser degree. Together, these data suggest that MCM3 phosphorylation is mainly dependent on Chk1. We next sought to determine the phosphorylation site(s) of MCM3 by Chk1. We first asked which region of MCM3 contains the phosphorylation signal. We generated four fragments targeting different regions of human MCM3 (Fig. 3A; note that new analysis identified an additional 45 residues at the N terminus of human MCM3 with GenBankTM accession number NM_002388.4; thus the FL MCM3 is 853 amino acids, not the previously reported 808 amino acids). We overexpressed HA-tagged MCM3 FL or the four fragments into HEK293T cells, IPed with anti-HA antibodies, and examined protein phosphorylation using the anti-Ser(P)/Thr(P) mixture. We repeatedly observed that fragment 1, but not the other three fragments, was phosphorylated to an extent similar to the FL (Fig. 3B, lanes 1 and 4, and data not shown). Protein sequence analysis revealed that human MCM3 contains a potential Chk1 phosphorylation site at Ser-205 in fragment 1 (also see Fig. 4A). Thus, we mutated Ser-205 to Ala in HA-MCM3 FL or fragment 1. As a control, we mutated Ser-419 of MCM3 to Ala because Ser-419 also matches to the consensus phosphorylation site of Chk1. We then measured phosphorylation of HA-MCM3 FL (WT, S205A, or S419A) and fragment 1 (WT or S205A). The results showed that mutating Ser-205 to Ala completely abolished phosphorylation of both the FL and the fragment 1 of MCM3 (Fig. 3B, lanes 1 and 2 and lanes 4 and 5). In contrast, the S419A mutation had almost no effect (Fig. 3B, lanes 1 and 3). To determine whether Ser-205 is the major phosphorylation site of MCM3 by Chk1, we performed an in vitro kinase assay using HA-MCM3 WT or the S205A mutant as the substrate in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. The results showed that the level of phosphorylated S205A mutant was significantly lower than that of the WT (Fig. 3C).FIGURE 4Ser-205 is the major site of MCM3 phosphorylated by Chk1. A, HA-MCM3 WT proteins were collected by IP from HEK293T cells, treated with CIAP, used in the in vitro kinase reaction, and run on SDS-PAGE, and the corresponding band was excised and used for mass spectrometry analyses. Phosphorylation was detected for the peptide 203–222 (one of the following four residues: Tyr-204, Ser-205, Thr-208, and Thr-209). B, HEK293T cells were transfected with HA-MCM3 FL (WT, S205A, or ASDLAA) for 48 h, IPed with anti-HA antibodies, and blotted with the anti-Ser(P)/Thr(P) mixture. The same membrane was stripped and reblotted with anti-HA antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further confirm these results, we isolated HA-MCM3 WT proteins after in vitro kinase reaction and identified its phosphorylation sites by mass spectrometry. Even without peptide enrichment, we detected a number of phosphopeptides of MCM3 (such as Thr-243, Thr-428, Thr-719, Ser-337, Ser-717, Ser-756, and Ser-773), indicating that 1) the phosphosignal of these peptides was abundant and 2) Chk1 and likely other kinases from the co-IP phosphorylated MCM3. Among them, a peptide (203–222) contains the above identified Chk1 consensus site, Ser-205 (Fig. 4A). However, the mass spectrometric results can only demonstrate that one of four sites in this peptide (Tyr-204, Ser-205, Thr-208, or Thr-209) is phosphorylated (Fig. 4A). To determine which one of the four sites is phosphorylated, w"

However, much less attention has been paid to the physiologic actions of IAPP on pancreatic β cells, which secrete this peptide together with insulin upon glucose stimulation. Here, we aimed to explore the signaling pathways and mitogenic actions of IAPP on β cells. We show that IAPP activated Erk1/2 and v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (Akt) at the picomolar range (10-100 pM) in mouse pancreatic islets and MIN6 β cells cultured at low glucose concentrations. In contrast, IAPP decreased the induction of these pathways by high glucose levels. Consistently, IAPP induced a 1.7-fold increase of β-cell proliferation at low-glucose conditions, whereas it reduced β-cell proliferation at high glucose levels. Strikingly, the specific antagonist of the IAPP receptor AC187 (100 nM) decreased the activation of Erk1/2 and Akt and reduced β-cell proliferation by 24% in glucose-stimulated β cells, uncovering a key role of endogenously released IAPP in β-cell responses to glucose. We conclude that exogenously added IAPP exerts a dual effect on β-cell mitogenic signaling and proliferation, depending on the glucose concentration. Importantly, secreted IAPP contributes to the signaling and mitogenic response of β cells to glucose through an autocrine mechanism.— Visa, M., Alcarraz-Vizán, G., Montane, J., Cadavez, L., Castaño, C., Villanueva-Peñacarrillo, M.

To survey the viral strains, genotyping assays for the natural polymorphisms in two latent EBV genes, EBNA2 and LMP1, were performed and consisted of real-time PCR on EBNA2 to distinguish type 1 and 2 viruses, fluorescent-based 30-bp typing assay on LMP1 to distinguish deletion and wild type LMP1, and fluorescent-based heteroduplex tracking assays on both EBNA2 and LMP1 to distinguish defined polymorphic variants. No discernible differences were observed between IM patients and AS. Multiple viral strains were acquired early at the start of infection. Stable persistence of dominant EBV strains in the same tissue compartment was observed throughout the longitudinal samples. LMP1-defined strains, China 1, China 2 and Mediterranean+, were the most common strains observed. EBNA2-defined groups 1 and 3e predominated the PBMC and saliva compartments. Concordance of EBNA2 and LMP1 strains between PBMC and saliva suggested ready interchange of viruses between circulating B cell and epithelial cell pools, whilst discordance of viral strains observed between plasma and PBMC/saliva indicated presence of viral pools in other undetermined tissue compartments. Taken together, the results indicated that the distribution, persistence and interchange of viral strains among the tissue compartments are more complex than those proposed by the current model of EBV life cycle."

This regulatory pathway controls the transcription of the foxA ferrioxamine receptor gene through the extracytoplasmic function sigma factor σFoxI. In the absence of ferrioxamine, the activity of σFoxI is inhibited by the transmembrane anti-sigma factor FoxR. Upon binding of ferrioxamine by the FoxA receptor, FoxR is processed by a complex proteolytic cascade leading to the release and activation of σFoxI.

This autoproteolytic event, which is widespread among CSS anti-sigma factors, produces two distinct domains that interact and function together to transduce the presence of the signal. In this work, we provide evidence that the self-cleavage of FoxR is not an enzyme-dependent process but is induced by an N-O acyl rearrangement.

https://openalex.org/W2002667252,"Knowledge of processes leading to crop damage is central to devising rational approaches to disease management. Multiple experiments established that infection of hop cones by Podosphaera macularis was most severe if inoculation occurred within 15 to 21 days after bloom. This period of infection was associated with the most pronounced reductions in alpha acids, cone color, and accelerated maturation of cones. Susceptibility of cones to powdery mildew decreased progressively after the transition from bloom to cone development, although complete immunity to the disease failed to develop. Maturation of cone tissues was associated with multiple significant affects on the pathogen manifested as reduced germination of conidia, diminished frequency of penetration of bracts, lengthening of the latent period, and decreased sporulation. Cones challenged with P. macularis in juvenile developmental stages also led to greater frequency of colonization by a complex of saprophytic, secondary fungi. Since no developmental stage of cones was immune to powdery mildew, the incidence of powdery mildew continued to increase over time and exceeded 86% by late summer. In field experiments with a moderately susceptible cultivar, the incidence of cones with powdery mildew was statistically similar when fungicide applications were made season-long or targeted only to the juvenile stages of cone development. These studies establish that partial ontogenic resistance develops in hop cones and may influence multiple phases of the infection process and pathogen reproduction. The results further reinforce the concept that the efficacy of a fungicide program may depend largely on timing of a small number of sprays during a relatively brief period of cone development. However in practice, targeting fungicide and other management tactics to periods of enhanced juvenile susceptibility may be complicated by a high degree of asynchrony in cone development and other factors that are situation-dependent."

We have taken a genetic approach to determine the impact of Timp3 loss on two mouse models of breast cancer. Interestingly, MMTV-PyMT Timp3−⁄− mice have delayed tumor onset and 36% of MMTV-Neu Timp3−⁄− mice remain tumor free. TIMP3 is a regulator of TNF signaling and similar to Timp3, Tnf or Tnfr1 loss delays early tumorigenesis. The tumor suppression in Timp3 null mice requires Tnfr1, but does not result in alterations in the local immune compartment. In the mammary gland, Timps are highly expressed in the stroma and through the transplantation of tumor cells we observe that Timp3 deficiency in the host is sufficient to delay the growth of early, but not advanced tumor cells. Together our data is the first to identify a tumor promoting role of endogenous Timp3 in vivo, the spatial and temporal windows of this effect, and its dependence on Tnfr1."

Therefore, it can be difficult to identify morphological and/or physiological traits responsible for enhancing performance in a given habitat.

However, physiological traits related to performance have been less well studied. We experimentally reared juvenile damselfish, Acanthochromis polyacanthus, under different water flow regimes to test 1) whether aspects of swimming physiology and morphology show plastic responses to water flow, 2) whether trait divergence correlates with swimming performance and 3) whether flow environment relates to performance differences observed in wild fish. We found that maximum metabolic rate, aerobic scope and blood haematocrit were higher in wave-reared fish compared to fish reared in low water flow. However, pectoral fin shape, which tends to correlate with sustained swimming performance, did not differ between rearing treatments or collection sites. Maximum metabolic rate was the best overall predictor of individual swimming performance; fin shape and fish total length were 3.3 and 3.7 times less likely than maximum metabolic rate to explain differences in critical swimming speed. Performance differences induced in fish reared in different flow environments were less pronounced than in wild fish but similar in direction. Our results suggest that exposure to water motion induces plastic physiological changes which enhance swimming performance in A. polyacanthus. Thus, functional relationships between fish morphology and performance across flow habitats should also consider differences in physiology."
https://openalex.org/W2081255427,"Alu elements and long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1 or L1) are two major human intersperse repetitive sequences. Lower Alu methylation, but not LINE-1, has been observed in blood cells of people in old age, and in menopausal women having lower bone mass and osteoporosis. Nevertheless, Alu methylation levels also vary among young individuals. Here, we explored phenotypes at birth that are associated with Alu methylation levels in young people. In 2010, 249 twenty-years-old volunteers whose mothers had participated in a study association between birth weight (BW) and nutrition during pregnancy in 1990, were invited to take part in our present study. In this study, the LINE-1 and Alu methylation levels and patterns were measured in peripheral mononuclear cells and correlated with various nutritional parameters during intrauterine and postnatal period of offspring. This included the amount of maternal intake during pregnancy, the mother's weight gain during pregnancy, birth weight, birth length, and the rate of weight gain in the first year of life. Catch-up growth (CUG) was defined when weight during the first year was >0.67 of the standard score, according to WHO data. No association with LINE-1 methylation was identified. The mean level of Alu methylation in the CUG group was significantly higher than those non-CUG (39.61% and 33.66 % respectively, P < 0.0001). The positive correlation between the history of CUG in the first year and higher Alu methylation indicates the role of Alu methylation, not only in aging cells, but also in the human growth process. Moreover, here is the first study that demonstrated the association between a phenotype during the newborn period and intersperse repetitive sequences methylation during young adulthood."

One of the recruitment mechanisms involves the formation of extended, hyaluronan-rich pericellular coats on local fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and epithelial cells. In the present work, we studied how IL-1β turns on the monocyte adhesion of the hyaluronan coat on human keratinocytes. IL-1β did not influence hyaluronan synthesis or increase the amount of pericellular hyaluronan in these cells. Instead, we found that the increase in the hyaluronan-dependent monocyte binding was associated with the CD44 of the keratinocytes. Although IL-1β caused a small increase in the total amount of CD44, a more marked impact was the decrease of CD44 phosphorylation at serine 325. At the same time, IL-1β increased the association of CD44 with ezrin and complex formation of CD44 with itself. Treatment of keratinocyte cultures with KN93, an inhibitor of calmodulin kinase 2, known to phosphorylate Ser-325 in CD44, caused similar effects as IL-1β (i.e. homomerization of CD44 and its association with ezrin) and resulted in increased monocyte binding to keratinocytes in a hyaluronan-dependent way. Overexpression of wild type CD44 standard form, but not a corresponding CD44 mutant mimicking the Ser-325-phosphorylated form, was able to induce monocyte binding to keratinocytes. In conclusion, treatment of human keratinocytes with IL-1β changes the structure of their hyaluronan coat by influencing the amount, post-translational modification, and cytoskeletal association of CD44, thus enhancing monocyte retention on keratinocytes.Background: Interleukin-1β recruits leukocytes at the site of inflammation.Results: The interleukin-1β-induced hyaluronan coat increased monocyte binding to keratinocytes through ezrin-associated CD44 homomers, enabled by reduced serine 325 phosphorylation.Conclusion: The organization of the cell surface hyaluronan coat is controlled by phosphorylation of CD44.Significance: Interleukin-1β release in inflamed tissues triggers signals that increase hyaluronan-dependent leukocyte binding.

CD44 is a single-pass transmembrane glycoprotein (reviewed in Refs. 1.Thorne R.F. Legg J.W. Isacke C.M.

Due to alternative splicing, numerous variant forms of CD44 are expressed in a cell- and tissue-specific fashion. Also, posttranslational modifications like N- and O-glycosylation, attachment of sulfated glycosaminoglycans (chondroitin, heparan, or keratan sulfate) in the extracellular domain, and palmitoylation and phosphorylations on the cytoplasmic side add to the diversity of the molecule (1.Thorne R.F.

Up to 10 variant exons can be included in the membrane proximal ectodomain, whereas the globular N terminus, called the link domain, contains the hyaluronan binding site (1.Thorne R.F. Legg J.W.

In addition, another splicing site close to the C terminus produces a variant with a shortened intracellular tail, expressed in chondrocytes (1.Thorne R.F. Legg J.W. Isacke C.M.

Hyaluronan, a ubiquitous multimillion-dalton molecular mass linear glycosaminoglycan, is the main extracellular ligand of CD44.

Cancer. 2004; 4: 528-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although all isoforms contain the link module, the ability of CD44 to bind hyaluronan depends on the cell type (15.Tzircotis G. Thorne R.F. Isacke C.M. Chemotaxis towards hyaluronan is dependent on CD44 expression and modulated by cell type variation in CD44-hyaluronan binding.J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 5119-5128Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Some cells that express CD44 are not able to bind hyaluronan at all, whereas CD44 in cells like lymphocytes can be induced to bind hyaluronan, and constitutive hyaluronan binding is also found in some cell types (16.Lesley J. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. Hyman R. Hyaluronan binding by cell surface CD44.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26967-26975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of CD44 to bind hyaluronan is influenced by alternative splicing and post-translational modifications as described above (1.Thorne R.F. Legg J.W. Isacke C.M.

On the other hand, CD44 itself can act as a signaling molecule by forming complexes with EGF receptor, ErbB2, TGF-β, PDGF receptor, and Src or by binding to the cytoskeleton (reviewed in Refs. 2.Toole B.P.

Due to the complexity of CD44 interactions, it has been assigned many functions, including lymphocyte homing, cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation. These functions are important in physiological and pathological processes like wound healing, inflammation, and cancer (1.Thorne R.F. Legg J.W. Isacke C.M. The role of the CD44 transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains in co-ordinating adhesive and signalling events.J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 2.Toole B.P. Hyaluronan-CD44 interactions in cancer: paradoxes and possibilities.Clin. Cancer Res. 2009; 15: 7462-7468Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Involvement in the inflammatory process is probably the most important function of CD44 because it can enhance leukocyte recruitment and resolve inflammation (21.Johnson P. Ruffell B. CD44 and its role in inflammation and inflammatory diseases.Inflamm. Allergy Drug Targets. 2009; 8: 208-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Cytokines released in inflamed tissues enhance homing of lymphocytes by stimulating their CD44 expression and ability to bind hyaluronan, thereby facilitating their rolling on the hyaluronan bound to CD44 in endothelial cells (21.Johnson P. Ruffell B. CD44 and its role in inflammation and inflammatory diseases.Inflamm. Allergy Drug Targets. 2009; 8: 208-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Cytokines also activate hyaluronan synthesis in inflamed tissues (reviewed in Refs. 22.Jiang D. Liang J. Noble P.W. Hyaluronan as an immune regulator in human diseases.Physiol. Rev. 2011; 91: 221-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar and 23.Oikari S. Jokela T.A. Tammi R.H. Tammi M.I. Karamanos N. Extracellular Matrix: Pathobiology and Signaling. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin2012: 39-65Google Scholar), creating adhesive temporary matrices and pericellular coats, often called hyaluronan cables (reviewed in Refs. 24.Day A.J. de la Motte C.A. Hyaluronan cross-linking: a protective mechanism in inflammation?.Trends Immunol. 2005; 26: 637-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar and 25.Petrey A.C. de la Motte C.A. Hyaluronan, a crucial regulator of inflammation.Front. Immunol. 2014; 5: 101Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Not only the amount of hyaluronan but also the inflammation-specific structure of the hyaluronan coat is important for leukocyte adhesion, because the normal, stable hyaluronan matrix is not adhesive for leukocytes. Hyaluronan cables associate with other molecules, like IαI, versican, and TSG-6, which are supposed to stabilize the cable structures and enhance the ability of leukocyte CD44 to bind them. However, the presence of the cable-associated molecules varies between cell types, and it is not fully understood which of them or whether any of them are crucial for the formation of the monocyte-adhesive coats (24.Day A.J. de la Motte C.A. Hyaluronan cross-linking: a protective mechanism in inflammation?.Trends Immunol. 2005; 26: 637-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Although more conspicuous in mesenchymal cells, cable-like structures have also been found in epithelial cells (26.Jokela T.A. Lindgren A. Rilla K. Maytin E. Hascall V.C. Tammi R.H. Tammi M.I.

In the present work, we studied whether IL-1β exerts a similar effect in keratinocytes and how this CD44 is associated with the formation of the cytokine-induced, extended hyaluronan coats observed previously in these cells (26.Jokela T.A.

Our data show that besides slightly increasing CD44 expression, IL-1β blocked phosphorylation of CD44 at serine 325 while at the same time it increased CD44 homomeric complexes and binding of CD44 to ezrin. These changes in CD44 phosphorylation, self-association, and cytoskeletal attachment apparently induced the extended hyaluronan coats that enhanced hyaluronan-dependent monocyte adhesion. Human keratinocytes (HaCaT) (34.Boukamp P. Petrussevska R.T. Breitkreutz D. Hornung J. Markham A. Fusenig N.E. Normal keratinization in a spontaneously immortalized aneuploid human keratinocyte cell line.J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 761-771Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used in the present study. These cells are able to form differentiated epidermis when subjected to signals from the dermis (35.Breitkreutz D. Schoop V.M. Mirancea N. Baur M. Stark H.J. Fusenig N.E. Epidermal differentiation and basement membrane formation by HaCaT cells in surface transplants.Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 75: 273-286Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They were cultured in DMEM (high glucose; Euroclone, Pero, Italy) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (HyClone, Logan, UT), 2 mm l-glutamine (Euroclone), 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Euroclone). U937 cells, originally derived from a human histiocytic lymphoma, were grown in suspension culture in RPMI medium with l-glutamine (Euroclone) and 5% FBS. The HaCaT cells were treated with IL-1β (10 ng/ml; BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA) for 4 or 20 h to induce an extended hyaluronan coat. To inhibit calmodulin signaling, a specific inhibitor of CAMKII (KN-93, 2.5–25.0 μm; Calbiochem) was used. To interfere with hyaluronan binding to CD44, the cells were incubated for 20 h with 0.2 mg/ml hyaluronan decasaccharides (a gift of Seikagaku Kogyo Co., Tokyo, Japan). To increase CD44 expression, we utilized a CD44 construct, which contained no variant exons, designed and cloned as described before (36.Neame S.J. Isacke C.M. Phosphorylation of CD44 in vivo requires both Ser323 and Ser325, but does not regulate membrane localization or cytoskeletal interaction in epithelial cells.EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4733-4738Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The CD44 cDNA constructs were cloned in pSRα plasmids. In addition to the wild type, standard CD44 construct, we used a mutant (CD44-S325D) in which serine 325 was changed to aspartic acid, mimicking a phosphate group at this position. An empty pSRα plasmid was used as a control. These plasmids are a generous gift from Dr. Clare Isacke. Plasmid transfections were done with ExGen 500 reagent according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer (Fermentas, Leon-Rot, Germany). HaCaT cells were seeded on 24-well plates and cultured close to confluence, followed by a 20-h incubation with IL-1β or KN-93. When studying the effects of CD44 overexpression, HaCaT cells were cultured on 24- or 48-well plates, transfected, and subjected for the binding assay 48 h after the transfection. The U937 monocytes suspended into cold medium were layered on top of the keratinocyte cultures (200,000 or 1,000,000 monocytes/well), followed by a 1-h incubation at 4 °C. To assess the amount of U937 cells specifically bound to hyaluronan, parallel cultures were treated with Streptomyces hyaluronidase (5 turbidity-reducing units/ml; Seikagaku Kogyo Co.) for 5–10 min at room temperature. Thereafter, the hyaluronidase-treated and non-treated cultures were both washed once with cold medium and fixed with Histochoice MB (Amresco, Solon, OH) for 20 min at room temperature. The number of bound monocytes were counted per microscopic field using a ×20 objective. Hyaluronan-dependent adhesion was calculated by subtracting the numbers of monocytes bound to hyaluronidase-treated cultures from those bound to non-treated cultures. For hyaluronan assays, HaCaT cells were cultured on 24-well plates and treated with IL-1β (10 ng/ml) and KN93 (10 and 25 μm) for 20 and 6 h, respectively. The media were collected, and the cell layers were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution, combining the wash with the medium. After release with trypsin, the cells were pelleted and counted for normalization, whereas the supernatants containing the cell-associated hyaluronan were boiled for 10 min to inactivate the trypsin. Hyaluronan contents in the media and trypsinates were measured using an enzyme-linked sorbent assay, performed as described earlier (37.Hiltunen E.L. Anttila M. Kultti A. Ropponen K. Penttinen J. Yliskoski M. Kuronen A.T. Juhola M. Tammi R. Tammi M. Kosma V.M. Elevated hyaluronan concentration without hyaluronidase activation in malignant epithelial ovarian tumors.Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6410-6413PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 96-well Maxisorp plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated with a 1 μg/ml concentration of the hyaluronan binding complex of the aggrecan G1 domain and link protein (HABC) prepared in our laboratory (38.Tammi R.

Hyaluronan standards (1–50 ng/ml) and samples diluted into 1% BSA in PBS were incubated in the wells for 1 h at 37 °C. After washes, the wells were sequentially incubated with 1 μg/ml biotinylated HABC and horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin (1:20,000 in PBS; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by a 10-min incubation at room temperature with TMB substrate solution (0.01% 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma) and 0.005% H2O2 in 0.1 m sodium acetate, 1.5 mm citric acid buffer. The reaction was stopped with 50 μl of 2 m H2SO4, and the absorbances were measured at 450 nm. HaCaT cells were plated on 8-well chamber slides (Nalge Nunc, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and grown for 2 days before the treatments. The cultures were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 1% BSA in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, for 10 min, and stained for hyaluronan using overnight incubation with biotinylated HABC (3 μg/ml in 1% BSA), followed by a 1-h incubation in FITC-labeled streptavidin (1:1,000; Vector Laboratories). For visualization of hyaluronan on live cells, the hyaluronan binding complex tagged with a fluorescent group (Alexa Fluor® 568) (5 μg/ml) was added to the culture medium and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C as described earlier. Before imaging, DRAQ5TM DNA dye (2.5 μm, Biostatus Ltd., Leicestershire, UK) was added to label the nuclei. HaCaT cells were cultured in 8-well chamber slides for 2 days after plating, changed into fresh medium, and subjected to the treatments. The cultures were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h at 4 °C for Ser-325-phosphorylated CD44 and with 2% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature for total CD44 and ezrin. Thereafter, the cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 1% BSA for 10 min, followed by overnight incubations with the primary antibodies at 4 °C and with the fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. The following primary and secondary antibodies were used: anti-CD44 (Hermes 1, Iowa Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa city, IA (1:100) and Hermes 3, a gift from Dr. Sirpa Jalkanen, University of Turku, Finland (1:200)), anti-Ser(P)-325-CD44 (18E2, a gift from Dr. Clare Isacke; 1:3 to 1:10), anti-ezrin (Labvision, Fremont, CA; 1:100), mouse non-immune IgG (Vector Laboratories), rabbit non-immune IgG (Vector Laboratories), rat non-immune IgG (Sigma), FITC or Texas Red anti-mouse IgG (Vector Laboratories; 1:200), Texas Red anti-rat antibody (Vector Laboratories; 1:200), and Texas Red anti-rabbit antibody (Vector Laboratories; 1:200). For dual stainings, the appropriate primary and secondary antibodies were added at the same time. The cells were mounted using Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). The fluorescent images were obtained either with an UltraView confocal scanner (PE-Wallac-LSR, Oxford, UK), built on a Nikon TE300 microscope, or with a Zeiss Axio Observer inverted microscope equipped with a Zeiss LSM 700 confocal module (Carl Zeiss Microimaging GmbH). For live cell imaging, a Zeiss XL-LSM S1 incubator with temperature and CO2 control was utilized. Image processing was performed using either ImageJ version 1.32 (National Institutes of Health) or ZEN 2009 software (Carl Zeiss Microimaging). For the PLA, HaCaT cells cultured in chamber slides were treated with IL-1β, KN-93, and hyaluronan decasaccharides (HA10) and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, followed by blocking for 20 min in 1% BSA with or without 0.1% Triton X-100 at room temperature. The PLA was done according to the manufacturer's instructions (Duolink II, Olink Bioscience, Uppsala, Sweden). For the detection of homomeric CD44 complexes, anti-CD44 antibody (Millipore, Billerica, MA) was labeled with the Duolink II PLUS and MINUS probes (1:100). For CD44-ezrin complexes, a cytoplasmic CD44 antibody (rabbit polyclonal, 1:300; a generous gift of Dr. Osamu Nagano and Dr. Hideyuki Saya) (39.Okamoto I. Tsuiki H. Kenyon L.C. Godwin A.K. Emlet D.R.

The specificity of the staining was controlled with non-immune mouse (Sigma) and rabbit (Vector Laboratories) IgG. Following overnight incubation at 4 °C, the samples for CD44-ezrin complexes were first treated with secondary antibodies against mouse and rabbit IgG, labeled with PLUS and MINUS probes, respectively (Duolink II), whereas the CD44-CD44 complexes continued directly to the ligation and amplification, using red detection reagents. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (1 μg/ml; Sigma). The specimens were imaged using a ×40, numerical aperture 1.3 oil or ×63, numerical aperture 1.4 oil objectives in the Zeiss confocal microscope.

https://openalex.org/W2027765942,"The dynamin family of GTPases has been implicated as novel regulators of the acrosome reaction, a unique exocytotic event that is essential for fertilization. Dynamin activity during the acrosome reaction is accompanied by phosphorylation of key serine residues. We now tested the hypothesis that glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) is the protein kinase responsible for dynamin phosphorylation at these phosphosites in mouse spermatozoa. Pharmacologic inhibition of GSK3 in mature mouse spermatozoa (CHIR99021: IC50 = 6.7 nM) led to a significant reduction in dynamin phosphorylation (10.3% vs. 27.3%; P < 0.001), acrosomal exocytosis (9.7% vs. 25.7%; P < 0.01), and in vitro fertilization (53% vs. 100%; P < 0.01). GSK3 was shown to be present in developing germ cells where it colocalized with dynamin in the peri-acrosomal domain. However, additional GSK3 was acquired by maturing mouse spermatozoa within the male reproductive tract, via a novel mechanism involving direct interaction of sperm heads with extracellular structures known as epididymal dense bodies. These data reveal a novel mode for the cellular acquisition of a protein kinase and identify a key role for GSK3 in the regulation of sperm maturation and acrosomal exocytosis.—Reid, A.T., Anderson, A.L., Roman, S.

https://openalex.org/W2006760747,"Degarelix is a gonadrotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor (GnRHR) antagonist used in patients with prostate cancer who need androgen deprivation therapy. GnRHRs have been found in extra-pituitary tissues, including prostate, which may be affected by the GnRH and GnRH analogues used in therapy. The direct effect of degarelix on human prostate cell growth was evaluated. Normal prostate myofibroblast WPMY-1 and epithelial WPE1-NA22 cells, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)-1 cells, androgen-independent PC-3 and androgen-dependent LNCaP prostate cancer cells, as well as VCaP cells derived from a patient with castration-resistant prostate cancer were used. Discriminatory protein and lipid fingerprints of normal, hyperplastic, and cancer cells were generated by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MS). The investigated cell lines express GNRHR1 and GNRHR2 and their endogenous ligands. Degarelix treatment reduced cell viability in all prostate cell lines tested, with the exception of the PC-3 cells; this can be attributed to increased apoptosis, as indicated by increased caspase 3/7, 8 and 9 levels. WPE1-NA22, BPH-1, LNCaP, and VCaP cell viability was not affected by treatment with the GnRH agonists leuprolide and goserelin. Using MALDI MS, we detected changes in m/z signals that were robust enough to create a complete discriminatory profile induced by degarelix. Transcriptomic analysis of BPH-1 cells provided a global map of genes affected by degarelix and indicated that the biological processes affected were related to cell growth, G-coupled receptors, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, angiogenesis and cell adhesion. Taken together, these data demonstrate that (i) the GnRH antagonist degarelix exerts a direct effect on prostate cell growth through apoptosis; (ii) MALDI MS analysis provided a basis to fingerprint degarelix-treated prostate cells; and (iii) the clusters of genes affected by degarelix suggest that this compound, in addition to its known use in the treatment of prostate cancer, may be efficacious in BPH."
https://openalex.org/W2159104813,"High serum levels of the pro-inflammatory adipokine resistin have been associated with decreased renal function in the general population. The goal of this study was to investigate whether such association is also present among diabetic subjects, who are at increased risk of renal function loss.The cross-sectional association between serum resistin levels and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was investigated in 1,560 type 2 diabetic (T2D) patients of European ancestry comprised in two different cohorts: 762 patients from San Giovanni Rotondo (SGR; Italy) and 798 patients from Boston (US).Serum resistin was inversely associated with eGFR in SGR [β (SE) for one SD of resistin increment = -1.01 (0.70) ml/min/1.73 m(2), p = 0.019] and in Boston [β (SE) = -5.31 (0.74) ml/min/1.73 m(2), p < 0.001] samples, as well as in the two studies combined [β (SE) = -3.42 (0.52) ml/min/1.73 m(2), p < 0.001]. The association was unaffected by adjustment for smoking habits, BMI, waist circumference, diabetes duration, HbA1c, insulin treatment, hypertension and lipid-lowering therapy: β (SE) for one SD of resistin increment = -1.07 (0.70), p = 0.02; -5.50 (0.88), p < 0.001; and -2.81 (0.55) ml/min/1.73 m(2), p < .001, in SGR, Boston and the two studies combined, respectively. The association was significantly stronger in men than in women (p for resistin-by-gender interaction = 0.003). For each resistin SD increment, the odds of having eGFR < 0 ml/min/1.7 3m(2) increased by 22% (OR = 1.22; 95% CI 1.02-1.44; p = 0.025) in SGR sample, 69% (OR = 1.69; 95% CI 1.38-2.07; p < 0.001) in Boston sample, and 47% (OR = 1.47; 95% CI 1.29-1.68; p < 0.001) in the two studies considered together.

https://openalex.org/W2045790470,"Cordyceps pruinosa (CP) is often used as Traditional Chinese Medicine, but the substance basis of its medicinal properties is unclear. In this study, two compounds were isolated from CP cultures by column chromatography, and identified as cordycepin and N6-(2-hydroxyethyl)-adenosine (HEA) by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance. In order to understand the efficacy of these two substances as potential therapeutic agents, it is necessary to explore their binding with proteins. The molecular mechanisms of interaction between cordycepin, HEA and human serum albumin (HSA) were studied using UV and fluorescence spectroscopy. The bingding constants between HSA and cordycepin were 4.227, 3.573 and 3.076 × 10(3)·at 17, 27 and 37°C respectively, and that of HSA and HEA were 27.102, 19.409 and 13.002 × 10(3)·at the three tempretures respectively. Both cordycepin and HEA can quench the intrinsic fluorescence of HSA via static quenching, and they can bind with HSA to form complexes with a single binding site. The interaction forces between cordycepin and HSA were determined as electrostatic and hydrophobic, and those of HEA and HSA were hydrogen bonding and van der Waals forces. Using Foster's equation, the distance between fluorophores of cordycepin and HSA, and HEA and HSA are estimated to be 5.31 nm and 4.98 nm, respectively. In this study, cordycepin was isolated for the first time from CP, and will provide a new source of cordycepin and expand the use of this taxon. The interaction mechanisms between cordycepin and HSA was studied for the first time, which will provide a useful guide for the clinical application of cordycepin. The pharmacological importance of this study is to understand the interaction of HSA with cordycepin and HEA, which will be essential for the future designing of drugs based on the two compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2164008502,"We tagged 82 lactating northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus) with tri-axial accelerometers and magnetometers on two eastern Bering Sea islands (Bogoslof and St. Paul) with contrasting population trajectories. Using depth data, accelerometer data and spectral analysis we classified time spent diving (30%), resting (~7%), shaking and grooming their pelage (9%), swimming in the prone position (~10%) and two types of previously undocumented rolling behavior (29%), with the remaining time (~15%) unspecified. The reason for the extensive rolling behavior is not known. We ground-truthed the accelerometry signals for shaking and grooming and rolling behaviors—and identified the acceleration signal for porpoising—by filming tagged northern fur seals in captivity. Speeds from GPS interpolated data indicated that animals traveled fastest while in the prone position, suggesting that this behavior is indicative of destination-based swimming. Very little difference was found in the percentages of time spent in the categorical behaviors with respect to breeding islands (Bogoslof or St. Paul Island), forager type (cathemeral or nocturnal), and the region where the animals foraged (primarily on-shelf <200m, or off-shelf > 200m). The lack of significant differences between islands, regions and forager type may indicate that behaviors summarized over a trip are somewhat hardwired even though foraging trip length and when and where animals dive are known to vary with island, forager type and region."

https://openalex.org/W2047868937,"Background To study the severity of diabetic neuropathy, diabetic retinopathy and grades of diabetic foot syndrome for correlations with corneal subbasal nerve plexus (SBP) changes in Congolese patients with type 2 diabetes. Methodology/Principal Findings Twenty-eight type 2 diabetes patients with diabetes-related foot ulceration were recruited in a diabetic care unit in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo. Corneal SBP was investigated by confocal laser-scanning microscopy to analyse nerve fibre density (NFD) [µm/ µm²], number of branches [n] and number of connectivity points [n]. Foot ulceration was graded using the Wagner ulcer classification. Corneal sensitivity (Cochet-Bonnet), Neuropathy Symptom Score (NSS), Neuropathy Disability Score (NDS), ankle-brachial index (ABI) and ophthalmological status were evaluated. Foot ulceration was ranked as mild (Wagner 0-1: 13 patients/46.4%), moderate (Wagner 2-3: 10 patients/35.7%) and severe (Wagner 4-5: 5 patients/17.9%). The correlation between Wagner Score and NFD (p=0.017, r = - 0,454), NDS and NFD (p=0,039, r = - 0.400) as well as Wagner Score and HbA1c (p=0,007, r = - 0.477) was stated. Significant differences in confocal SBP parameters were observed between Wagner 0-1 and Wagner 4 5 (number of branches (p=0.012), number of connectivity points (p=0.001), nerve fibre density (p=0.033)) and ABI (p=0.030), and between Wagner 2-3 and Wagner 4-5 (number of branches (p=0.003), number of connectivity points (p=0.005) and nerve fibre density (p=0.014)). Differences in NDS (p=0.001) and corneal sensation (p=0.032) were significant between Wagner 0-1 and Wagner 2-3. Patients with diabetic retinopathy had significantly longer diabetes duration (p=0.03) and higher NDS (p=0.01), but showed no differences in SBP morphology or corneal sensation. Conclusions/Significance While confirming the diabetic aetiology of foot ulceration due to medial arterial calcification, this study indicates that the grade of diabetic foot syndrome correlates with corneal SBP changes and corneal sensation in patients in sub-Saharan Africa."

We therefore sought to establish the feasibility of a telomerase-based assay for detecting and isolating live melanoma CTCs. Methods The telomerase-based CTC assay utilizes an adenoviral vector that, in the presence of elevated human telomerase activity, drives the amplification of green fluorescent protein. Tumor cells are then identified via an image processing system. The protocol was tested on melanoma cells in culture or spiked into control blood, and on samples from patients with metastatic melanoma. Genetic analysis of the isolated melanoma CTCs was then performed for BRAF mutation status. Results The adenoviral vector was effective for all melanoma cell lines tested with sensitivity of 88.7% (95%CI 85.6-90.4%) and specificity of 99.9% (95%CI 99.8-99.9%). In a pilot trial of patients with metastatic disease, CTCs were identified in 9 of 10 patients, with a mean of 6.0 CTCs/mL. At a cutoff of 1.1 CTCs/mL, the telomerase-based assay exhibits test performance of 90.0% sensitivity and 91.7% specificity. BRAF mutation analysis of melanoma cells isolated from culture or spiked control blood, or from pilot patient samples was found to match the known BRAF mutation status of the cell lines and primary tumors. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first report of a telomerase-based assay effective for detecting and isolating live melanoma CTCs. These promising findings support further studies, including towards integrating into the management of patients with melanoma receiving multimodality therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2025870891,"The transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) or prion diseases are a group of fatal neurodegenerative disorders characterised by the accumulation of a pathological form of a host protein known as prion protein (PrP). The validation of abnormal PrP detection techniques is fundamental to allow the use of high-throughput laboratory based tests, avoiding the limitations of bioassays. We used scrapie, a prototype TSE, to examine the relationship between infectivity and laboratory based diagnostic tools. The data may help to optimise strategies to prevent exposure of humans to small ruminant TSE material via the food chain. Abnormal PrP distribution/accumulation was assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC), Western blot (WB) and ELISA in samples from four animals. In addition, infectivity was detected using a sensitive bank vole bioassay with selected samples from two of the four sheep and protein misfolding cyclic amplification using bank vole brain as substrate (vPMCA) was also carried out in selected samples from one animal. Lymph nodes, oculomotor muscles, sciatic nerve and kidney were positive by IHC, WB and ELISA, although at levels 100-1000 fold lower than the brain, and contained detectable infectivity by bioassay. Tissues not infectious by bioassay were also negative by all laboratory tests including PMCA. Although discrepancies were observed in tissues with very low levels of abnormal PrP, there was an overall good correlation between IHC, WB, ELISA and bioassay results. Most importantly, there was a good correlation between the detection of abnormal PrP in tissues using laboratory tests and the levels of infectivity even when the titre was low. These findings provide useful information for risk modellers and represent a first step toward the validation of laboratory tests used to quantify prion infectivity, which would greatly aid TSE risk assessment policies."
https://openalex.org/W2077148761,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded small RNAs (EBERs) are the most highly expressed transcripts in all EBV-associated tumors and are involved in both lymphoid and epithelioid carcinogenesis. Our previous study on Chinese isolates from non-endemic area of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) identified new EBER variants (EB-8m and EB-10m) which were less common but relatively more frequent in NPC cases than healthy donors. In the present study, we determined the EBER variants in NPC cases and healthy donors from endemic and non-endemic areas of NPC within China and compared the EBER variants, in relation to the genotypes at BamHI F region (prototype F and f variant), between population groups and between two areas. According to the phylogenetic tree, four EBER variants (EB-6m, EB-8m, EB-10m and B95-8) were identified. EB-6m was dominant in all population groups except for endemic NPC group, in which EB-8m was dominant. EB-8m was more common in endemic NPC cases (82.0%, 41/50) than non-endemic NPC cases (33.7%, 32/95) (p<0.0001), and it was also more frequent in healthy donors from endemic area (32.4%, 24/74) than healthy donors from non-endemic area (1.1%, 1/92) (p<0.0001). More importantly, the EB-8m was more prevalent in NPC cases than healthy donors in both areas (p<0.0001). The f variant, which has been suggested to associate with endemic NPC, demonstrated preferential linkage with EB-8m in endemic isolates, however, the EB-8m variant seemed to be more specific to NPC isolates than f variant. These results reveal high prevalence of EBER EB-8m variant in endemic NPC cases, suggesting an association between NPC development and EBV isolates carrying EB-8m variant. Our finding identified a small healthy population group that shares the same viral strain which predominates in NPC cases. It could be interesting to carry extensive cohort studies following these individuals to evaluate the risk to develop NPC."
https://openalex.org/W1987993826,"Biological variation is commonly measured at two basic levels: variation within individual communities, and the distribution of variation over communities or within a metacommunity. We develop a classification for the measurement of biological variation on both levels: Within communities into the categories of dispersion and diversity, and within metacommunities into the categories of compositional differentiation and partitioning of variation. There are essentially two approaches to characterizing the distribution of trait variation over communities in that individuals with the same trait state or type tend to occur in the same community (describes differentiation tendencies), and individuals with different types tend to occur in different communities (describes apportionment tendencies). Both approaches can be viewed from the dual perspectives of trait variation distributed over communities (CT perspective) and community membership distributed over trait states (TC perspective). This classification covers most of the relevant descriptors (qualified measures) of biological variation, as is demonstrated with the help of major families of descriptors. Moreover, the classification is shown to open ways to develop new descriptors that meet current needs. Yet the classification also reveals the misclassification of some prominent and widely applied descriptors: Dispersion is often misclassified as diversity, particularly in cases where dispersion descriptor allow for the computation of effective numbers; the descriptor GST of population genetics is commonly misclassified as compositional differentiation and confused with partitioning-oriented differentiation, whereas it actually measures partitioning-oriented apportionment; descriptors of β-diversity are ambiguous about the differentiation effects they are supposed to represent and therefore require conceptual reconsideration."
https://openalex.org/W1997793071,"Background HIV-infected individuals are at increased risk of right and left heart dysfunction. N-terminal-pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), a marker of cardiac ventricular strain and systolic dysfunction, may be associated with all-cause mortality in HIV-infected women. The aim of this study was to determine if elevated levels of NT-proBNP is associated with increased mortality in HIV-infected women. Design Prospective cohort study. Methods and Results We measured NT-proBNP in 936 HIV-infected and 387 age-matched HIV-uninfected women early (10/11/94 to 7/17/97) and 1082 HIV-infected and 448 HIV-uninfected women late (4/1/08 to 10/7/08) in the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) periods in the Women’s Interagency HIV Study. An NT-proBNP >75th percentile was more likely in HIV-infected persons, but only statistically significant in the late period (27% vs. 21%, unadjusted p = 0.03). In HIV-infected participants, NT-proBNP>75th percentile was independently associated with worse 5-year survival in the early HAART period (HR 1.8, 95% CI 1.3–2.4, p<0.001) and remained a predictor of mortality in the late HAART period (HR 2.8, 95% CI 1.4–5.5, p = 0.002) independent of other established risk covariates (age, race/ethnicity, body mass index, smoking, hepatitis C serostatus, hypertension, renal function, and hemoglobin). NT-proBNP level was not associated with mortality in HIV-uninfected women. Conclusion NT-proBNP is a novel independent marker of mortality in HIV-infected women both when HAART was first introduced and currently. As NT-proBNP is often associated with both pulmonary hypertension and left ventricular dysfunction, these findings suggest that these conditions may contribute significantly to adverse outcomes in this population, requiring further definition of causes and treatments of elevated NT-proBNP in HIV-infected women."
https://openalex.org/W1992910599,"Background Increasing burden of STDs is one of China’s major public health concerns. However, only a limited number of studies have ever investigated the prevalence of these STDs, particular for genital warts and its correlates among heterosexual males attending STD clinics in China. In order to fill this gap, we conducted a cross-sectional study among MSCs in Jiangmen, China, between the years of 2009 and 2010. Method The eligible participants were recruited from several STD-clinics in public hospitals. We collected demographic information and behaviors of the participants. After HIV and syphilis testing, we further checked whether the participants had genital warts and genital herpes. In addition, urine samples were collected from part of the participants for CT and NG testing. Results Of the 533 eligible participants, over three-fifths were aged 35 or below, nearly three quarters had no college degree, over three-fifths were residence of Jiangmen. The prevalence of HIV, syphilis, genital warts, genital herpes, CT and NG were 0.19%, 7.50%, 7.32%, 5.25%, 9.73% and 6.19%, respectively. Living with family members (versus living alone), no STD-related service in past year, experiencing STDs related symptoms in past year, and sex with FSWs in last three months were positively associated with genital warts, with adjusted ORs of 5.54 (95% CI 1.94–15.81), 2.26 (95% CI 1.08–4.74), 1.99 (95% CI 1.00–3.99) and 2.01 (95% CI 1.00–4.04), respectively. Conclusion Our study indicates that the prevalence of STDs among MSCs in Jiangmen was high, which may further spread HIV among MSCs. Targeted interventions that focused on STDs related services uptake should be implemented urgently."

Major microsporidian structural proteins, such as the spore wall protein (SWP), are known to be involved in host invasion. In this study, the reactivity of the monoclonal antibody 2B10 was tested against an endospore protein of N. bombycis with a molecular weight size at 50-kDa, using Western blotting. The antigen was purified after immunoprecipitation and was further identified as EOB13320 according to MALDI-TOF MS assay. We found that EOB13320 locates to the surface of the different developmental stages of the parasite, mostly the sporoblast stage and the mature spore after immunoelectron microscopy examination. EOB13320 was also widely distributed in the developing endospore, especially at the sporoblast stage. This endospore protein also accumulated in the cytoplasm of both the merogony and sporoblast stages. These results imply that EOB13320 detected by monoclonal antibody 2B10 is expressed throughout the life cycle of the parasite, notably during the stage when the endospore is formed, and that this protein is important for spore-coat formation and parasite maintenance. Our study could be instrumental in the understanding of spore wall formation and will help to gain greater insight into the biology of this parasite."
