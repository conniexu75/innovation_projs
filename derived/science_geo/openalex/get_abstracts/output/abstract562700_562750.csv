https://openalex.org/W2440302195,"Local mRNA translation mediates the adaptive responses of axons to extrinsic signals, but direct evidence that it occurs in mammalian CNS axons in vivo is scant. We developed an axon-TRAP-RiboTag approach in mouse that allows deep-sequencing analysis of ribosome-bound mRNAs in the retinal ganglion cell axons of the developing and adult retinotectal projection in vivo. The embryonic-to-postnatal axonal translatome comprises an evolving subset of enriched genes with axon-specific roles, suggesting distinct steps in axon wiring, such as elongation, pruning, and synaptogenesis. Adult axons, remarkably, have a complex translatome with strong links to axon survival, neurotransmission, and neurodegenerative disease. Translationally co-regulated mRNA subsets share common upstream regulators, and sequence elements generated by alternative splicing promote axonal mRNA translation. Our results indicate that intricate regulation of compartment-specific mRNA translation in mammalian CNS axons supports the formation and maintenance of neural circuits in vivo."

Functional connectivity analysis indicated a flow of contextual information from the hippocampus to prefrontal cortex upon the rat's entry into the spatial context. Conversely, upon the onset of object sampling, the direction of information flow reversed, consistent with prefrontal control over the retrieval of context-appropriate hippocampal memory representations."

To investigate how the ER-associated Degradation (ERAD) machinery can accomplish retrotranslocation of a misfolded luminal protein domain across a lipid bilayer, we have reconstituted retrotranslocation with purified S. cerevisiae proteins, using proteoliposomes containing the multi-spanning ubiquitin ligase Hrd1. Retrotranslocation of the luminal domain of a membrane-spanning substrate is triggered by autoubiquitination of Hrd1. Substrate ubiquitination is a subsequent event, and the Cdc48 ATPase that completes substrate extraction from the membrane is not required for retrotranslocation. Ubiquitination of lysines in Hrd1’s RING-finger domain is required for substrate retrotranslocation in vitro and for ERAD in vivo.

Our results suggest that Hrd1 forms a ubiquitin-gated protein-conducting channel. Misfolded proteins in the ER are disposed of by a process called ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) (for review, see Christianson and Ye, 2014Christianson J.C. Ye Y. Cleaning up in the endoplasmic reticulum: ubiquitin in charge.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2014; 21: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and probably in all other eukaryotic cells, substrates are degraded by three different ERAD pathways (ERAD-L, -M, and -C), depending on whether their misfolded domain is localized in the ER lumen, within the membrane, or on the cytosolic side of the ER membrane (Carvalho et al., 2006Carvalho P.

Misfolded proteins are sorted by a sequential checkpoint mechanism of ER quality control.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Most substrates of these ERAD pathways are polyubiquitinated on the cytosolic side of the ER membrane, but they employ distinct ubiquitin ligase complexes. ERAD-L substrates use the RING-finger ubiquitin ligase Hrd1 in complex with three other membrane proteins (Hrd3, Usa1, and Der1) and a luminal protein (Yos9). ERAD-M substrates also use Hrd1, but only a subset of the other components. ERAD-C substrates require Doa10, another RING-finger ligase. A fourth ERAD pathway has recently been identified that disposes of inner nuclear membrane proteins (Foresti et al., 2014Foresti O. Rodriguez-Vaello V. Funaya C. Carvalho P.

It uses a RING-finger ligase that comprises three membrane proteins (Asi1, 2, and 3). All ERAD pathways converge on the cytosolic side, where they require components of the ubiquitination machinery and an ATPase complex consisting of Cdc48, Ufd1, and Npl4. The Cdc48 complex is thought to move polyubiquitinated substrates into the cytosol, where they are ultimately degraded by the proteasome (Bays et al., 2001Bays N.W. Wilhovsky S.K. Goradia A.

Many aspects of ERAD remain unclear, but arguably the most important unresolved question is how a misfolded protein crosses the ER membrane. This question is particularly relevant for ERAD-L substrates, which have to be inserted into the luminal side of the ER membrane, moved through the membrane, and extracted on the cytosolic side. It seems unlikely that these ERAD substrates are moved directly through the lipid bilayer. Rather, like in other cases of protein translocation, transport probably occurs through a conduit or channel formed by integral membrane proteins (Collinson et al., 2015Collinson I. Corey R.A.

Several multi-spanning membrane proteins have been proposed as channel candidates. These include the Sec61 channel that is normally involved in “forward” translocation of proteins from the cytosol into the ER (Pilon et al., 1997Pilon M. Schekman R. Römisch K.

A membrane protein complex mediates retro-translocation from the ER lumen into the cytosol.Nature. 2004; 429: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar), and the Hrd1 ubiquitin ligase (Carvalho et al., 2010Carvalho P. Stanley A.M. Rapoport T.A. Retrotranslocation of a misfolded luminal ER protein by the ubiquitin-ligase Hrd1p.Cell. 2010; 143: 579-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Hrd1 seems to be a major component of the retrotranslocation channel, as its overexpression in S. cerevisiae bypasses the other membrane components (Hrd3, Usa1, and Der1) (Carvalho et al., 2010Carvalho P. Stanley A.M. Rapoport T.A. Retrotranslocation of a misfolded luminal ER protein by the ubiquitin-ligase Hrd1p.Cell. 2010; 143: 579-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), whereas overexpression of these proteins, does not bypass the Hrd1 requirement. In overexpressing Hrd1 cells, the downstream cytosolic components, including the Cdc48 complex, are still needed. Hrd1 overexpression makes substrate selection less specific, but the cells remain viable (Denic et al., 2006Denic V. Quan E.M. Weissman J.S. A luminal surveillance complex that selects misfolded glycoproteins for ER-associated degradation.Cell. 2006; 126: 349-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, Hrd1 itself is polyubiquitinated and degraded (Gardner et al., 2000Gardner R.G. Swarbrick G.M. Bays N.W. Cronin S.R. Wilhovsky S. Seelig L. Kim C. Hampton R.Y. Endoplasmic reticulum degradation requires lumen to cytosol signaling. Transmembrane control of Hrd1p by Hrd3p.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). These results suggest that Hrd1 is the only membrane component required for a basic ERAD-L process. However, since these experiments were performed with intact cells, they do not exclude the possibility that other, unidentified membrane proteins form the retrotranslocon or cooperate with Hrd1. In vitro reconstitution experiments with purified components are crucial to identify the retrotranslocation channel and elucidate the role of Hrd1. We have recently made progress toward the goal of reconstituting ERAD with purified components by recapitulating substrate recognition, polyubiquitination, and recruitment of the Cdc48 complex in detergent (Stein et al., 2014Stein A. Ruggiano A. Carvalho P. Rapoport T.A. Key steps in ERAD of luminal ER proteins reconstituted with purified components.Cell. 2014; 158: 1375-1388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We also demonstrated Cdc48-dependent membrane extraction of a polyubiquitinated protein. However, the proteoliposomes contained a pre-assembled complex of Hrd1 and a soluble ERAD-L substrate in which at least one segment of the substrate was exposed to the outside of the vesicles before addition of Cdc48 complex. Because the misfolded substrate was not exclusively in the lumen of the vesicles, this system was inappropriate to study the retrotranslocation of a substrate across the membrane. Thus, the mechanism of the most important step in ERAD, the retrotranslocation of a polypeptide, has not yet been clarified. The lack of a retrotranslocation assay also makes it impossible to test whether Hrd1 forms a retrotranslocon, and if so, how it is gated. Here, we have recapitulated Hrd1-dependent retrotranslocation using membrane-spanning substrates. We show that autoubiquitination of Hrd1 on several lysines of its RING-finger domain allows the misfolded luminal domain of a substrate to move across the membrane. The Cdc48 ATPase complex is not required for retrotranslocation. Our results indicate that Hrd1 forms a ubiquitin-gated protein-conducting channel. Other membrane-spanning ubiquitin ligases in the ER may function in an analogous manner. Our previous experiments employed a well-established soluble ERAD-L substrate, misfolded carboxypeptidase Y (CPY∗), which differs from the native protein by a single point mutation (Finger et al., 1993Finger A. Knop M. Wolf D.H. Analysis of two mutated vacuolar proteins reveals a degradation pathway in the endoplasmic reticulum or a related compartment of yeast.Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). However, this substrate is difficult to use in retrotranslocation assays, as it needs to be exclusively located inside proteoliposomes at the beginning of the reaction. This is technically demanding, none the least because the reconstituted vesicles have a small internal volume. To circumvent this problem, we used a membrane-spanning substrate. CPY∗ was fused to a C-terminal transmembrane (TM) segment derived from the multi-spanning protein Pdr5, followed by a short tail (CPY∗-TM; Figure 1A) (Taxis et al., 2003Taxis C. Hitt R. Park S.H. Deak P.M. Kostova Z. Wolf D.H. Use of modular substrates demonstrates mechanistic diversity and reveals differences in chaperone requirement of ERAD.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35903-35913Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In contrast to CPY∗, CPY∗-TM can be reconstituted with high efficiency into proteoliposomes because the TM segment preferentially partitions into the lipid bilayer. The protein is expected to sit in the lipid bilayer in both orientations (Figure 1B). These proteoliposomes can be used to establish a retrotranslocation assay in which the movement of the CPY∗ domain from the lumen to the outside of the vesicles can be observed (see scheme in Figure 1B). We first characterized CPY∗-TM in vivo. A variant of CPY∗-TM with lysines in the cytosolic tail has been reported to be an ERAD-M substrate, as its degradation in S. cerevisiae was found to be dependent on Hrd1, but not Der1 (Taxis et al., 2003Taxis C. Hitt R. Park S.H. Deak P.M. Kostova Z. Wolf D.H. Use of modular substrates demonstrates mechanistic diversity and reveals differences in chaperone requirement of ERAD.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35903-35913Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Degradation of our CPY∗-TM substrate was dependent on Hrd1 and partially on Der1, as shown by cycloheximide-chase experiments (Figure 1C; representative blot in Figure S1A). The deletion of DOA10 had no effect. Soluble CPY∗ and membrane-bound KWW were tested in parallel and, as reported (Knop et al., 1996Knop M. Finger A. Braun T. Hellmuth K. Wolf D.H. Der1, a novel protein specifically required for endoplasmic reticulum degradation in yeast.EMBO J. 1996; 15: 753-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, Vashist and Ng, 2004Vashist S. Ng D.T.W. Misfolded proteins are sorted by a sequential checkpoint mechanism of ER quality control.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), behaved as pure ERAD-L substrates, since they were completely dependent on both Hrd1 and Der1 (data not shown). Thus, it seems that CPY∗-TM can use both ERAD-L and -M pathways. We reasoned that CPY∗-TM might be converted into a pure ERAD-L substrate by replacing the TM segment of the multi-spanning integral membrane protein Pdr5 with the TM segment of the single-spanning Spt23 protein. Indeed, this substrate (CPY∗-TM2) became completely dependent on Hrd1 and Der1 (Figure 1D; representative blot in Figure S1B). These results support the idea that ERAD-L substrates are misfolded in luminal domains, whereas ERAD-M substrates have unfavorable sequence features inside the membrane (Carvalho et al., 2006Carvalho P. Goder V. Rapoport T.A. Distinct ubiquitin-ligase complexes define convergent pathways for the degradation of ER proteins.Cell. 2006; 126: 361-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). It should be noted that the TMs and C-terminal tails of CPY∗-TM and CPY∗-TM2 do not contain lysines to which ubiquitin chains could be attached (Figure S1C). CPY∗-TM, but not CPY∗-TM2, has a single serine in the tail, which could serve as an alternative modification site. Thus, most or all ubiquitination occurs in the CPY∗ domain of the substrates. We tested whether purified CPY∗-TM and CPY∗-TM2 interact with purified Hrd1, as observed previously for CPY∗ (Stein et al., 2014Stein A. Ruggiano A. Carvalho P. Rapoport T.A. Key steps in ERAD of luminal ER proteins reconstituted with purified components.Cell. 2014; 158: 1375-1388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The proteins were labeled with a fluorescent dye at the C terminus using sortase (Popp et al., 2007Popp M.W. Antos J.M. Grotenbreg G.M. Spooner E. Ploegh H.L. Sortagging: a versatile method for protein labeling.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 707-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, Stein et al., 2014Stein A. Ruggiano A. Carvalho P. Rapoport T.A. Key steps in ERAD of luminal ER proteins reconstituted with purified components.Cell. 2014; 158: 1375-1388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and incubated with increasing concentrations of Hrd1 immobilized on beads. CPY∗-TM and CPY∗-TM2 bound to Hrd1 with an apparent affinity in the nanomolar range, although not as strongly as CPY∗ (Figure 1E). In contrast, CPY-TM and CPY-TM2 (a fusion of wild-type CPY to the same C-terminal domains as in CPY∗-TM and CPY∗-TM2) did not bind as efficiently (Figure 1E). These results confirm that Hrd1 has a higher affinity for misfolded proteins (Stein et al., 2014Stein A. Ruggiano A. Carvalho P. Rapoport T.A. Key steps in ERAD of luminal ER proteins reconstituted with purified components.Cell. 2014; 158: 1375-1388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and indicate that Hrd1 primarily recognizes the luminal CPY∗ domain. Next, Hrd1 was incubated with the substrates in the presence of purified ubiquitination machinery, i.e., ubiquitin activating enzyme Uba1 (E1), ubiquitin conjugating enzyme Ubc7 (E2), its activator Cue1, ubiquitin, and ATP. Polyubiquitination was observed with CPY∗-TM and CPY∗-TM2, but not with CPY-TM or CPY-TM2 (Figures 1F and 1G), indicating that the discrimination between unfolded and folded proteins is more pronounced in the ubiquitination reaction than in the binding assay. To examine the Hrd1-substrate interaction in a membrane context, we reconstituted fluorescently labeled CPY∗-TM (red, DyLight680) and Hrd1 (blue, DyLight800) into proteoliposomes (Figure 2A). CPY∗-TM was added to a mixture of phosphatidylcholine and Triton X-100, the detergent was removed with Bio-Beads, and the vesicles floated in a glycerol gradient. They were then incubated with Hrd1 at a low concentration of the detergent decyl maltose neopentyl glycol (DMNG), such that the liposomes were only partially solubilized and Hrd1 reconstituted into them in a unidirectional manner (see scheme in Figure 2A). The detergent was removed and the vesicles were floated again in a glycerol gradient. Both the labeled substrate and Hrd1 floated to the same position in the gradient (Figure 2B). Essentially, all Hrd1 molecules were oriented with their C terminus on the outside of the vesicles, as demonstrated by the accessibility of a unique TEV protease recognition motif in the cytosolic domain; cleavage was observed regardless of whether the vesicles were intact or solubilized with detergent (Figure 2C). The orientation of Hrd1 is equivalent to that in ER membranes, with the outside of vesicles corresponding to the cytosol. Incubation of the proteoliposomes with the ubiquitination machinery resulted in the polyubiquitination of both CPY∗-TM and Hrd1 (Figure 2D). As observed previously in detergent, autoubiquitination was faster and more complete than substrate ubiquitination (see also Stein et al., 2014Stein A. Ruggiano A. Carvalho P. Rapoport T.A. Key steps in ERAD of luminal ER proteins reconstituted with purified components.Cell. 2014; 158: 1375-1388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In the absence of any one of the components of the ubiquitination machinery, the modification reaction was abolished or, in the case of Cue1, reduced. The rate of Hrd1p autoubiquitination was about the same in the presence or absence of substrate (Figure S2A). Similar results were obtained with proteoliposomes containing labeled CPY∗-TM2 and Hrd1 (Figure S2B). The efficiency of polyubiquitination was slightly lower (50% modified for CPY∗-TM2 versus 60% for CPY∗-TM, respectively), but the ratio of the two membrane topologies, determined by protease protection, was about the same for both constructs (Figure S2C). CPY∗-TM was used in the initial characterization of the in vitro system described below, but most experiments were also performed with CPY∗-TM2. Substrate and Hrd1 have to be located in the same vesicle for substrate ubiquitination to occur, as no modification was observed when CPY∗-TM and Hrd1 were reconstituted into separate vesicles (Figure 2E). Moreover, when proteoliposomes containing CPY∗-TM were incubated with soluble CPY∗, only the membrane-bound substrate was modified (Figure 2F). These results show that substrate is only polyubiquitinated when it interacts with Hrd1 in the same membrane. We used reconstituted proteoliposomes containing membrane-bound substrate and Hrd1 to test whether the CPY∗ domain moves from the inside to the outside of the vesicles, i.e., retrotranslocates through the membrane (see scheme in Figure 1B). We first prepared vesicles with C-terminally sortase-labeled CPY∗-TM in both orientations (blue, DyLight800; see scheme in Figure 3A). After reconstitution, the vesicles were incubated again with sortase and a peptide coupled to DyLight680, so that the color was switched in all CPY∗-TM molecules that had their C terminus on the outside (Figure 3A, red). Finally, Hrd1 was incorporated into the liposomes as before. This procedure generates Hrd1-containing proteoliposomes in which the two differently oriented substrate populations carry distinct labels. The labeled substrate molecules were in the same vesicles as streptavidin-binding peptide (SBP)-tagged Hrd1, as both the blue and red CPY∗-TM molecules were quantitatively captured by streptavidin beads (Figure S3A). Co-reconstitution was also tested in the converse experiment, in which the vesicles were captured through interaction with substrate (Figure S3B). To this end, CPY∗-TM molecules with their C terminus on the outside were color-switched from DyLight800 to Alexa488 (green) using sortase. After incorporation of DyLight680-labeled Hrd1, the vesicles were incubated with antibodies to Alexa488 and protein G beads. Labeled substrate and Hrd1 were quantitatively bound to the beads (Figure S3B), confirming that they were in the same vesicles.Figure S3Characterization of Proteoliposomes Used in Retrotranslocation Assays, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Proteoliposomes (PLsomes) containing SBP-tagged Hrd1 and CPY∗-TM in both orientations (labeled with DyLight680 or DyLight800) were incubated with streptavidin or control beads.

Substrate molecules that have their C terminus on the outside were color-switched from green (Alexa488) to red (DyLight680) using sortase. All vesicles were pre-incubated with Alexa488-quenching antibody and ubiquitin machinery (no ATP). After time “0,” the indicated components were added. Note that Alexa488 fluorescence was only quenched when Triton X-100 (X100) was added, indicating that there is no leakage of antibody into the PLsomes, and that the C terminus is not moved across the membrane. (E) The samples in (D) were analyzed for polyubiquitination of red (DyLight680) substrate. (F) PLsomes were prepared that contain unlabeled Hrd1 and CPY∗-TM2 in both orientations. Substrate molecules that have their C terminus on the outside were color-switched from blue (DyLight800) to red (DyLight680) using sortase. CPY∗-TM2 also contained an additional lysine-attached green dye (Alexa488) to which a quenching antibody is available. The vesicles were incubated with antibody and ubiquitination machinery in the absence of ATP. The sample was placed in a fluorescence plate reader, ATP was added (open arrow), and the decrease in fluorescence was followed over time. A control was performed by addition of Triton X-100 (X100) before the reaction (open arrow). Each sample received Triton X-100 after the reaction (closed arrow).

However, these sequences have only been studied in the context of spatial tasks and never in humans. Here, we recorded magnetoencephalography (MEG) while human subjects performed a novel non-spatial reasoning task. The task required selecting paths through a set of six visual objects. We trained pattern classifiers on the MEG activity elicited by direct presentation of the visual objects alone and tested these classifiers on activity recorded during periods when no object was presented. During these object-free periods, the brain spontaneously visited representations of approximately four objects in fast sequences lasting on the order of 120 ms. These sequences followed backward trajectories along the permissible paths in the task. Thus, spontaneous fast sequential representation of states can be measured non-invasively in humans, and these sequences may be a fundamental feature of neural computation across tasks."

Proteins display the capacity to fold, often into well packed three-dimensional structures, and to carry out biologically essential activities such as catalysis, signal transmission, and allosteric regulation. The amino acid sequence reflects the constraints arising from these properties, and considerable prior work has focused on understanding how the sequence encodes folding and biochemical function (Anfinsen, 1973Anfinsen C.B.

For instance, proteins must arise through a random, iterative, stepwise process of mutation and selection, and they must be capable of adaptive variation as conditions of fitness vary in the environment. These considerations may place unique and yet unknown “design” constraints on evolved proteins, a missing aspect of our current understanding. An example of such a constraint might be functional connectivity in adaptive paths—the requirement that adaptation between fitness peaks proceeds through intermediates that maintain function above the threshold of selection (Smith, 1970Smith J.M. Natural selection and the concept of a protein space.Nature. 1970; 225: 563-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar).

Robustness, evolvability, and neutrality.FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 1772-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). One such property is conditional neutrality, a special case in which mutations have no significant effect in the existing genetic or environmental background but have a significant effect upon subsequent changes in either the genome or environment (Draghi et al., 2010Draghi J.A. Parsons T.L. Wagner G.P. Plotkin J.B. Mutational robustness can facilitate adaptation.Nature. 2010; 463: 353-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, Draghi and Plotkin, 2011Draghi J.A.

Robustness, evolvability, and neutrality.FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 1772-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Such variations are “cryptic” in the sense that they hide their effects on fitness until exposed in the right setting and can therefore accumulate and pre-exist in populations as standing genetic variations (Luria and Delbrück, 1943Luria S.E. Delbrück M. Mutations of Bacteria from Virus Sensitivity to Virus Resistance.Genetics. 1943; 28: 491-511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because conditionally neutral mutations arise without selection and only express their fitness advantages upon subsequent events, they are said to be pre-adaptive (or “exaptive”; Gould and Vrba, 1982Gould S.J. Vrba E.S. Exaptation - a Missing Term in the Science of Form.Paleobiology. 1982; 8: 4-15Crossref Scopus (2783) Google Scholar) and represent a pool of variants that can facilitate the emergence of novel adaptive phenotypes. Indeed, conditional neutrality has been convincingly demonstrated to facilitate adaptation both theoretically (Draghi et al., 2010Draghi J.A. Parsons T.L. Wagner G.P. Plotkin J.B. Mutational robustness can facilitate adaptation.Nature. 2010; 463: 353-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) and experimentally (Hayden et al., 2011Hayden E.J. Ferrada E. Wagner A. Cryptic genetic variation promotes rapid evolutionary adaptation in an RNA enzyme.Nature. 2011; 474: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and, conceptually, represents the key link between the two major driving forces for genetic variation in populations: neutral drift and selection (Draghi and Plotkin, 2011Draghi J.A. Plotkin J.B. Molecular evolution: Hidden diversity sparks adaptation.Nature. 2011; 474: 45-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Understanding the prevalence and structural principles of conditional neutrality in protein molecules represents a key step in linking biophysical variation at the molecular level to evolutionary viability. In this work, we carry out a series of experiments and simulations in the PSD95, DLG1, ZO-1 (PDZ) family of protein interaction modules to explore the prevalence, structural origin, importance, and mechanism of conditional neutrality. We show that conditional neutrality emerges from a distributed network of physically contiguous amino acids that permits a specific set of distantly positioned residues to unlock new structural and functional states at the ligand binding site. These adaptive positions are contained within the PDZ protein sector—a conserved and coevolving network of amino acid positions in the entire protein family (Halabi et al., 2009Halabi N. Rivoire O.

Poelwijk F.J. Raman A. Gosal W.S. Ranganathan R. The spatial architecture of protein function and adaptation.Nature. 2012; 491: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). These findings allow us to propose basic structural principles of adaptation, and they open the hypothesis that the capacity to adapt may be the origin of allosteric mechanisms in proteins. A case study of protein adaptation is evident in PSD95pdz3, a member of the PDZ protein family (Harris and Lim, 2001Harris B.Z. Lim W.A. Mechanism and role of PDZ domains in signaling complex assembly.J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3219-3231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Sheng and Sala, 2001Sheng M. Sala C. PDZ domains and the organization of supramolecular complexes.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). PDZ domains are roughly 100-amino acid mixed α/β folds that typically recognize the C-terminal region of target proteins at a groove formed between the β2 strand and α2 helix (Figure 1A); for simplicity, we refer to this groove as the “active site.” Ligand specificity is largely defined by the amino acid sequence in the last four positions (numbered in reverse order from the carboxyl terminus [position 0]), with the major determinant of specificity being the identity of the residue at the antepenultimate (−2) position (Songyang et al., 1997Songyang Z.

For example, class I domains bind ligands with a consensus of -X-S/T-X-ϕ-COOH (X is any amino acid, ϕ is hydrophobic) and class II domains with a consensus of -X-ϕ-X-ϕ-COOH. PSD95pdz3 is an archetypical class I domain, binding its cognate ligand (-TKNYKQTSV-COOH, derived from the cysteine-rich interactor of PDZ (CRIPT) (Niethammer et al., 1998Niethammer M. Valtschanoff J.G. Kapoor T.M. Allison D.W. Weinberg R.J. Craig A.M. Sheng M. CRIPT, a novel postsynaptic protein that binds to the third PDZ domain of PSD-95/SAP90.Neuron. 1998; 20: 693-707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) with an affinity (indicated by the equilibrium dissociation constant, Kd = 0.8μM) that is 45-fold higher than to a class-switching mutant peptide (T-2F, -TKNYKQFSV-COOH, specifying a Thr-to-Phe substitution at the −2 position) (Figure 1B). Because PDZ domains operate with dissociation constants in the 1–15μM range (Stiffler et al., 2007Stiffler M.A. Chen J.R. Grantcharova V.P. Lei Y. Fuchs D. Allen J.E. Zaslavskaia L.A. MacBeath G. PDZ domain binding selectivity is optimized across the mouse proteome.Science. 2007; 317: 364-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), this dynamic range represents a physiologically significant degree of specificity. Previous work shows that a double mutant of PSD95pdz3 (G330T,H372A) displays a near-complete reversal of specificity for these two peptides (McLaughlin et al., 2012McLaughlin Jr., R.N. Poelwijk F.J. Raman A. Gosal W.S. Ranganathan R. The spatial architecture of protein function and adaptation.Nature. 2012; 491: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). It shows roughly a 45-fold preference for the T-2F ligand and an affinity (Kd = 0.5μM) that is similar to that of the wild-type protein for the CRIPT ligand (Figure 1B). These data frame a minimal instance of the problem of adaptive mutational paths. H372A and G330T represent two distinct strategies for achieving the class-switching specificity change. Position 372 is directly located at the ligand binding site and interacts with the residue at the −2 position of the target peptide. For example, in PSD95pdz3, the histidine residue at this position makes a hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group on the −2 threonine side chain of the ligand (Figure 1C), an interaction that is thought to represent the basis for the Ser/Thr specificity of class I PDZ domains (Doyle et al., 1996Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Crystal structures of a complexed and peptide-free membrane protein-binding domain: molecular basis of peptide recognition by PDZ.Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, the H372A mutation shows a substantial (34-fold) loss of affinity for the CRIPT ligand (Figure 1B). It also shows gain of function for the T-2F ligand, and, thus, this single active site mutation on its own provides a partially class-switching phenotype (13-fold T-2F preference) that is then enhanced by the G330T mutation to quantitatively complete the specificity switch. In contrast, the G330T-first path is strikingly different. Position 330 is positioned on a surface loop (β 2-β 3) behind the active site and makes no direct interactions with ligand (Figures 1A and 1C), but mutation at this site creates a dual-function protein capable of binding both the CRIPT ligand and the T-2F ligand with equally high affinity (Figure 1B). In the language of evolutionary biology, G330T is a potential example of a “conditionally neutral” or cryptic mutation (Draghi et al., 2010Draghi J.A. Parsons T.L. Wagner G.P. Plotkin J.B. Mutational robustness can facilitate adaptation.Nature. 2010; 463: 353-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, Hayden et al., 2011Hayden E.J. Ferrada E. Wagner A. Cryptic genetic variation promotes rapid evolutionary adaptation in an RNA enzyme.Nature. 2011; 474: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, Wagner, 2005Wagner A. Robustness, evolvability, and neutrality.FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 1772-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar)—essentially neutral with regard to existing function (binding of the CRIPT ligand) but significantly favorable with regard to a new function (binding of the class-switching T-2F ligand). Subsequent acquisition of the H372A mutation establishes class II specificity by reducing the affinity for the class I CRIPT ligand (Figure 1B). To test the notion that G330T acts as a functional bridge between class specificities, we measured the binding of wild-type, G330T, H372A, and the double-mutant protein to a library of all possible peptide ligands defined by randomizing the C-terminal four amino acid positions (204 = 160,000 total ligands). This analysis is made possible by a quantitative bacterial two-hybrid (BTH) assay for PDZ function in which transcription of a reporter gene is tuned to be linearly proportional to the binding free energy of PSD95pdz3 to target ligands (Figure S1; McLaughlin et al., 2012McLaughlin Jr., R.N. Poelwijk F.J. Raman A. Gosal W.S. Ranganathan R. The spatial architecture of protein function and adaptation.Nature. 2012; 491: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The reporter gene is chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT), and thus the binding profile of any PDZ variant over the full space of all ligands can be assessed simply by selecting bacterial cells carrying the BTH on chloramphenicol and deep sequencing of the library before and after selection. The binding between PDZ and each ligand is given by ΔEx, the normalized log ratio of observing ligand x in the selected and unselected libraries (Experimental Procedures; Figure S1). We obtained excellent counting statistics for 154,521 of the 160,000 possible ligands for all four PSD95pdz3 variants (Table S1)—a near-complete global profile of ligand specificity over the adaptive path defined by the G330T,H372A double mutant. Hierarchical clustering of a few top binding sequences provides an intuitive preview of the full dataset (Figure 2A). Consistent with the data in Figure 1B, PSD95pdz3 binds ligands with T/S preference at the −2 position (class I), H372A and the double mutant bind ligands with hydrophobic amino acids at −2 (class II), and G330T binds ligands in both classes. The full dataset is very high-dimensional and impossible to directly visualize. Accordingly, we used principal components analysis (PCA) to project all peptides bound with better than 15 μM affinity by any of the four PSD95pdz3 variants (2,359 total) onto a two-dimensional space based on their profile of binding (Figure 2C). This low-dimensional projection is well justified. The first two principal components (V1 and V2) capture nearly 97% of the total variance representing relationships between the 2,359 ligands with physiologically relevant affinity (Figure 2B). The principal components also have clear biochemical meaning. V1 separates ligands by amino acid preference at the class-defining −2 position (S/T [class I] to left of the origin, bulky hydrophobic [class II] to the right), and V2 separates ligands by a combination of preference at both −2 and −3 (Figure 2C). Thus, the PCA provides a statistically accurate and intuitive representation of ligand specificity over the adaptive path. Figure 3 shows the binding profiles of wild-type, G330T,H372A, and the double mutant variants of PSD95pdz3 projected onto the two-dimensional space. With the 15 μM cutoff for physiological relevance, the wild-type exclusively binds peptides in the class I space (Figure 3A), and both H372A and the double mutant bind ligands exclusively in the class II space (Figures 3C and 3D). This confirms that both the H372A single mutant and the double mutant are able to switch class specificity. In contrast, G330T shows a distinct binding profile that provides a link between the space of class I and class II ligands (Figure 3B). Thus, G330T is indeed a functional bridge—a single mutation that makes PSD95pdz3 capable of recognizing both classes of ligands. Amino acid profiles of ligands bound by the four PSD95pdz3 variants over a range of threshold binding affinities reinforce these findings (Figure S2). These data also provide a data-rich illustration of the concept of conditional neutrality—a mutation that preserves existing function while opening up new functions; in this case, binding to physiologically distinct ligand variants.Figure S2Sequence Profiles of Ligand Peptides Bound by PDZ Variants along the Adaptive Path, Related to Figures 2 and 3Show full captionEach panel shows the pattern of amino acid preferences at ligand positions (labeled −3 to 0) as a “sequence logo” plot for the PDZ variant and affinity cutoff indicated.

Note that G330T is not a “generalist” or “promiscuous” protein in any typical sense. It maintains high-affinity binding and only recognizes 846 ligands of 154,521 total, a number that is in the same range as the other, more class-specific PSD95pdz3 variants (Table S1). It also recognizes ligands only in the lower half of the ligand space spanned by the top principal components (Figure 3B), showing that the effect is mainly in the shape, rather than the breadth, of the binding profile. Thus, G330T is a targeted class-bridging mutation capable of providing a near-neutral path from the native class I ligand (CRIPT) to a specific region of class II specificity. Subsequent acquisition of H372A to make the double mutant then localizes and reconfigures the binding specificity completely in the class II space (Figure 3D). Which path—G330T first or H372A first—is evolutionarily more likely to achieve the specificity switch defined by the double mutant in PSD95pdz3? Given that H372A provides a partial class switch in just one mutation (Figure 1B), it is important to understand what advantage (if any) there is in the class-bridging phenotype of G330T as an intermediate in the adaptive path. To study this, we carried out computational simulations of evolutionary dynamics between the wild-type and G330T,H372A double mutant states over a range of mutation rates and ligand-switching rates. Each trial of simulation is initiated with a population of wild-type PSD95pdz3 genotypes (N = 1000), which is large given the small number of genotypes considered (four; Figure 4A). At each generation, single mutations between genotypes are allowed with a probability μ and double mutations with probability μ2, the target ligand switches between the class I CRIPT peptide and the class II T-2F peptide every τ generations, and fitness at every generation is defined as a fraction-bound of ligand determined from the experimentally defined equilibrium dissociation constants (Figure 1B). The total ligand concentration is set to 10μM, a value in the middle of the specificity range of wild-type PSD95pdz3—the relevant regime for non-trivial dynamics. In essence, this simulation gives an opportunity to study how the flux between the two paths to the double mutant state depends on both internal parameters (mutation rate and population size) and external parameters (environmental switching between the two class-distinct ligands). A representative simulation trajectory at one particular mutation and ligand-switching rate illustrates properties of the adaptive process (Figure 4B). In this case, τ = 500 and Nμ = 1, meaning that the ligand switches every 500 generations, and one single mutation is made, on average, at every generation. As expected, the wild-type genotype (black trace) is the most fit in the presence of the class I CRIPT ligand, with a small fraction of other genotypes stochastically occurring in the population according to the mutation rate and on their fitness relative to the wild-type. Switching to the T-2F ligand causes the population to ultimately switch to the double mutant state (blue), the genotype that is most fit for the T-2F ligand under these simulation conditions. However, the path of switching can show considerable trial-by-trial variability with regard to intermediates. For example, in this trajectory, G330T (green) is more prevalent in trial 1 and H372A (red) more prevalent in trial 2. Averaged over many trials of switching (∼500 events) from CRIPT to T-2F, we find that G330T is by far the preferred path of adaptation to the double-mutant state given the selected mutation and ligand-switching rates (Figure 4D). How can we understand this result mechanistically? Because both G330T and H372A can bind the T-2F ligand about equally well (Figure 1B), the path simply depends on the relative availability of these genotypes in the population at the moment of switching (Figure 4B, insets). This property, in turn, depends on the fitness of G330T and H372A while in the CRIPT environment, a factor that heavily favors G330T over H372A (Figure 1B; KdG330T=2.2±0.33μM and KdH372A=26.9±6.3μM). As a consequence, G330T typically comprises the majority of the cryptic genetic variation in the CRIPT environment, more likely to be present and able to support transition to the double-mutant state when the environment switches to T-2F. How does this result depend on mutation rate and the switching rate of target ligand? Simulations show that conversion to the double-mutant state is only achieved over a certain regime of ligand-switching rate. This makes sense: if ligand switches too rapidly to permit fixation of the double mutant, the population converges to the only genotype that is fit for the average of both ligand environments—G330T (Figure S3). However, in any regime of ligand-switching rate in which the double mutant fixes in the population, G330T is always more preferred than H372A in mediating adaptation (Figures 4C–4E). This is true when mutations are rare (Nμ << 1; Figure 4C) and when mutations are abundant (Nμ >> 1; Figure 4E). Thus, it is the neutral, class-bridging genotype rather than the direct class-switching genotype that represents the likely intermediate in adaptation to new ligand class specificity. But how “neutral” does a mutation have to be to be statistically preferred over a class-switching mutant such as H372A in mediating adaptation? Indeed, even G330T is not strictly neutral in the CRIPT environment (KdG330T=2.2±0.33μM and KdWT=0.8±0.09μM); this is the reason why it is considerably less competitive than the wild-type (Figure 4B). To study this, we carried out a series of simulations in which we examined the effect of varying the affinity of G330T for the CRIPT ligand from near wild-type (1μM) to that of the class-switching mutant (26.9μM; Figure 1B). The data show that, given the conditions of the simulation,"

The aim of this study was to determine the estimated average protein requirement and recommended protein intake in endurance athletes during an acute 3-d controlled training period using the indicator amino acid oxidation method. After 2-d of controlled diet (1.4 g protein/kg/d) and training (10 and 5km/d, respectively), six male endurance-trained adults (28±4 y of age; Body weight, 64.5±10.0 kg; VO2peak, 60.3±6.7 ml·kg-1·min-1; means±SD) performed an acute bout of endurance exercise (20 km treadmill run) prior to consuming test diets providing variable amounts of protein (0.2-2.8 g·kg-1·d-1) and sufficient energy. Protein was provided as a crystalline amino acid mixture based on the composition of egg protein with [1-13C]phenylalanine provided to determine whole body phenylalanine flux, 13CO2 excretion, and phenylalanine oxidation. The estimated average protein requirement was determined as the breakpoint after biphasic linear regression analysis with a recommended protein intake defined as the upper 95% confidence interval. Phenylalanine flux (68.8±8.5 μmol·kg-1·h-1) was not affected by protein intake. 13CO2 excretion displayed a robust bi-phase linear relationship (R2 = 0.86) that resulted in an estimated average requirement and a recommended protein intake of 1.65 and 1.83 g protein·kg-1·d-1, respectively, which was similar to values based on phenylalanine oxidation (1.53 and 1.70 g·kg-1·d-1, respectively). We report a recommended protein intake that is greater than the RDA (0.8 g·kg-1·d-1) and current recommendations for endurance athletes (1.2-1.4 g·kg-1·d-1). Our results suggest that the metabolic demand for protein in endurance-trained adults on a higher volume training day is greater than their sedentary peers and current recommendations for athletes based primarily on nitrogen balance methodology.ClinicalTrial.gov NCT02478801."

We performed a genome-wide DNA methylation quantitative trait locus (mQTL) analysis in human adipose tissue of 119 men, where 592,794 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were related to DNA methylation of 477,891 CpG sites, covering 99% of RefSeq genes. SNPs in significant mQTLs were further related to gene expression in adipose tissue and obesity related traits. We found 101,911 SNP-CpG pairs (mQTLs) in cis and 5,342 SNP-CpG pairs in trans showing significant associations between genotype and DNA methylation in adipose tissue after correction for multiple testing, where cis is defined as distance less than 500 kb between a SNP and CpG site. These mQTLs include reported obesity, lipid and type 2 diabetes loci, e.g. ADCY3/POMC, APOA5, CETP, FADS2, GCKR, SORT1 and LEPR. Significant mQTLs were overrepresented in intergenic regions meanwhile underrepresented in promoter regions and CpG islands. We further identified 635 SNPs in significant cis-mQTLs associated with expression of 86 genes in adipose tissue including CHRNA5, G6PC2, GPX7, RPL27A, THNSL2 and ZFP57. SNPs in significant mQTLs were also associated with body mass index (BMI), lipid traits and glucose and insulin levels in our study cohort and public available consortia data. Importantly, the Causal Inference Test (CIT) demonstrates how genetic variants mediate their effects on metabolic traits (e.g. BMI, cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)) via altered DNA methylation in human adipose tissue.

https://openalex.org/W2466778429,"People in Western cultures are poor at naming smells and flavors. However, for wine and coffee experts, describing smells and flavors is part of their daily routine. So are experts better than lay people at conveying smells and flavors in language? If smells and flavors are more easily linguistically expressed by experts, or more “codable”, then experts should be better than novices at describing smells and flavors. If experts are indeed better, we can also ask how general this advantage is: do experts show higher codability only for smells and flavors they are expert in (i.e., wine experts for wine and coffee experts for coffee) or is their linguistic dexterity more general? To address these questions, wine experts, coffee experts, and novices were asked to describe the smell and flavor of wines, coffees, everyday odors, and basic tastes. The resulting descriptions were compared on a number of measures. We found expertise endows a modest advantage in smell and flavor naming. Wine experts showed more consistency in how they described wine smells and flavors than coffee experts, and novices; but coffee experts were not more consistent for coffee descriptions. Neither expert group was any more accurate at identifying everyday smells or tastes. Interestingly, both wine and coffee experts tended to use more source-based terms (e.g., vanilla) in descriptions of their own area of expertise whereas novices tended to use more evaluative terms (e.g., nice). However, the overall linguistic strategies for both groups were en par. To conclude, experts only have a limited, domain-specific advantage when communicating about smells and flavors. The ability to communicate about smells and flavors is a matter not only of perceptual training, but specific linguistic training too."
https://openalex.org/W2462201052,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by degeneration of upper motor neurons (UMN) arising from the motor cortex in the brain and lower motor neurons (LMN) in the brainstem and spinal cord. Cerebral changes create differences in brain activity captured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), including the spontaneous and simultaneous activity occurring between regions known as the resting state networks (RSNs). Progressive neurodegeneration as observed in ALS may lead to a disruption of RSNs which could provide insights into the disease process. Previous studies have reported conflicting findings of increased, decreased, or unaltered RSN functional connectivity in ALS and do not report the contribution of UMN changes to RSN connectivity. We aimed to bridge this gap by exploring two networks, the default mode network (DMN) and the sensorimotor network (SMN), in 21 ALS patients and 40 age-matched healthy volunteers. An UMN score dichotomized patients into UMN+ and UMN- groups. Subjects underwent resting state fMRI scan on a high field MRI operating at 4.7 tesla. The DMN and SMN changes between subject groups were compared. Correlations between connectivity and clinical measures such as the ALS Functional Rating Scale—Revised (ALSFRS-R), disease progression rate, symptom duration, UMN score and finger tapping were assessed. Significant group differences in resting state networks between patients and controls were absent, as was the dependence on degree of UMN burden. However, DMN connectivity was increased in patients with greater disability and faster progression rate, and SMN connectivity was reduced in those with greater motor impairment. These patterns of association are in line with literature supporting loss of inhibitory interneurons."

These observations demonstrate that in a range of organisms, including insects, fish, and mammals, early olfactory information is represented as spatio-temporal patterns of glomerular activity. How these activity patterns are decoded by the brain to guide odor-evoked behavior, however, remains largely unknown. Olfactory research in Drosophila melanogaster has provided elements of answer to this question. Using behavioral genetics, attraction, and aversion to specific odors have been linked to the activation of one or a few glomeruli in the antennal lobe (AL) (Ai et al., 2010Ai M. Min S. Grosjean Y.

A single population of olfactory sensory neurons mediates an innate avoidance behaviour in Drosophila.Nature. 2004; 431: 854-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). These observations suggest a labeled-line coding strategy, in which individual glomeruli convey signals of specific ethological relevance for the animal and their activation triggers the execution of hard-wired behavioral programs. However, it remains uncertain whether this is a property of a specialized subset of glomeruli or constitutes a general coding principle in the AL. More importantly, how compound signals from multiple glomeruli are integrated to determine the valence of odors, including mixtures of odors commonly found in natural environments, is poorly understood (Kreher et al., 2008Kreher S.A. Mathew D. Kim J. Carlson J.R. Translation of sensory input into behavioral output via an olfactory system.Neuron. 2008; 59: 110-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Another open question is the coding beyond absolute odor valence. Flies, for example, choose the less aversive odor when forced to make a choice between two inherently aversive stimuli (Tully and Quinn, 1985Tully T. Quinn W.G. Classical conditioning and retention in normal and mutant Drosophila melanogaster.J. Comp. Physiol. A Neuroethol. Sens. Neural Behav. Physiol. 1985; 157: 263-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). Moreover, studies in humans have shown that the evaluation of relative odor valence changes depending on the context (Clepce et al., 2014Clepce M. Neumann K. Martus P. Nitsch M. Wielopolski J. Koch A. Kornhuber J. Reich K. Thuerauf N. The psychophysical assessment of odor valence: does an anchor stimulus influence the hedonic evaluation of odors?.Chem. Senses. 2014; 39: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). How relative valence is computed in the brain and how it is modulated according to the context remains elusive, although a recent study showed that divisive normalization can explain context-dependent choice behavior in primates (Louie et al., 2013Louie K. Khaw M.W. Glimcher P.W. Normalization is a general neural mechanism for context-dependent decision making.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 6139-6144Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Here, we used a combination of optical imaging and behavioral techniques to address these questions systematically. We used two-photon imaging to monitor Ca2+ signals in the whole AL in response to a diverse set of odors. Comparing these data with odor-evoked behavioral responses allowed us to formulate a decoding model describing how innate olfactory behavior is dictated by the population of projection neurons (PNs), the AL output neurons, in a quantitative manner. We found that a weighted sum of normalized PN responses can recapitulate observed behavior and predict responses to novel odors, including mixtures and odors at different concentrations. The valence assigned to individual glomeruli in our analysis is consistent with previous findings; however, the contribution of individual glomeruli to the behavioral output is small, indicating that odor valence is not dominated by a few privileged glomeruli but depends on pooling small contributions over a large number of glomeruli. This conclusion is further supported by genetic silencing and optogenetic activation of individual olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) types, which evoked modest biases in behavior in accordance with the model predictions. Strikingly, behavioral responses were altered when the same odors were tested in different olfactory contexts. Our decoding model captured this adaptive behavior and correctly predicted that the relative preference of pairs of odors could switch depending on the olfactory context. These results highlight the ability of the olfactory system to adapt to the statistics of its olfactory environment, similarly to the visual and auditory systems (Kohn, 2007Kohn A. Visual adaptation: physiology, mechanisms, and functional benefits.J. Neurophysiol. 2007; 97: 3155-3164Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, Wark et al., 2007Wark B. Lundstrom B.N. Fairhall A. Sensory adaptation.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2007; 17: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). We first sought to characterize odor-evoked behavioral responses by monitoring the behavior of tethered flies in a flight-simulator arena. The arena was equipped with a closed-loop feedback system that allowed animals to virtually adjust their heading direction by modulating the amplitudes of their left and right wing beats (Figures 1A and S1). A change in heading direction was accompanied by a corresponding rotation of the visual and olfactory landscapes, defining a virtual-reality-like environment for the animal to navigate. Olfactory stimuli were delivered in the form of a plume, spanning 45° in azimuth, which flies were free to exit or re-enter by adjusting their heading direction (Figure 1B). The valence of olfactory stimuli in this setup could thus be assessed by monitoring the tendency to navigate in or out of the odor plume. We initially characterized odor-evoked behavior in this assay using a set of six odorants, which we expected on the basis of prior reports (Knaden et al., 2012Knaden M. Strutz A. Ahsan J. Sachse S. Hansson B.S. Spatial representation of odorant valence in an insect brain.Cell Rep. 2012; 1: 392-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, Semmelhack and Wang, 2009Semmelhack J.L. Wang J.W. Select Drosophila glomeruli mediate innate olfactory attraction and aversion.Nature. 2009; 459: 218-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) and preliminary experiments to be either strongly attractive or aversive, and three control stimuli (mineral oil, water, and air). Flies often exited aversive odors by producing a fast saccadic turn (Figure 1C). Similar avoidance behavior was not observed in response to air, for which trajectories only showed occasional low-amplitude saccades. Attractive odors, on the other hand, evoked a reduction in turning rate and a tendency to navigate in the odor for a longer time. To quantify these responses, we defined a measure of olfactory preference termed valence index (VI) as the proportion of time spent outside the odor plume. When computed relative to the time of odor application, instantaneous VIs increased monotonically and showed consistent trends extending beyond the period of odor application (Figure 1D). Given that attractive and aversive VIs were best separated near the end of the odor application period, we scored each odor using the mean VI value in the last 1 s of odor application (Figure 1E; our results are largely independent of the choice of the scoring period, see Figure S1). Of the six tested odors, two attractive and three aversive odors evoked significant responses compared with air (Figure 1E). Solvents also evoked mildly attractive responses. Attraction to humidified air has been documented and is strongly reduced by the mutation of Orco (Lin et al., 2015Lin C.C. Prokop-Prigge K.A. Preti G. Potter C.J. Food odors trigger Drosophila males to deposit a pheromone that guides aggregation and female oviposition decisions.eLife. 2015; 4: e08688Google Scholar). Attraction to mineral oil also likely depends on the olfactory system, as mineral oil evoked sparse but significant glomerular activity in our measurements (see Figure 2D), and blocking synaptic transmission in Orco-dependent ORNs evoked a small increase in VI (Figure S2). To further examine responses to diverse odors, we screened odor-evoked responses to a panel of 84 odors, consisting of 36 pure odorants, 4 of which were sampled at 4 different concentrations, and 36 binary mixtures of attractive and aversive odors at various ratios (Table S1). Odors were sampled in sets of 6 and delivered sequentially in each experiment. To verify that the baseline behavior was consistent across different odor sets, we included mineral oil in every experiment. VI values for the 36 pure odorants showed a nearly continuous array of responses (Figure 1F). After correcting for multiple comparisons, 3 odorants were significantly more attractive, and 13 were more aversive, than mineral oil. When compared to air, odors were almost symmetrically split into two sides (Figure 1F). These results demonstrate that flies exhibit both attraction and aversion in response to a variety of odors in our assay. Inspection of individual flight trajectories (Figure 1C) revealed that escape responses to aversive stimuli can be remarkably fast. Because flight orientation is controlled by the relative amplitude of wing beats, we computed the absolute difference between the left and the right wing-beat amplitudes (ΔWBA). As expected, air did not evoke noticeable changes in ΔWBA (Figure 1G). In contrast, aversive odors evoked a sharp, transient increase in ΔWBA, whereas attractive odors evoked a slower, sustained decrease. VI values were tightly correlated with the cumulative ΔWBA (Figure 1G, inset), confirming that our behavioral measure reflects an active, stimulus-evoked modulation of the turning rate. To estimate the response latency, we fitted ΔWBA for an aversive odor with a sum of exponentials (Figure 1G). The fitted curve deflected (10% rise time) 200 ms after the first contact with the odor, indicating that the time required to perceive, process, and respond to an aversive stimulus is shorter than 200 ms. We next examined PN activity in response to the same panel of odors under identical odor delivery conditions. In the fly AL, inputs from ORNs are segregated into ∼50 glomeruli, all of which are identifiable across individuals (Couto et al., 2005Couto A. Alenius M. Dickson B.J.

Because PNs in the same glomerulus transmit highly correlated information (Kazama and Wilson, 2009Kazama H. Wilson R.I. Origins of correlated activity in an olfactory circuit.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 1136-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), each glomerulus can be considered as a unit of output. Therefore, the entire olfactory information transmitted from the AL can be obtained by monitoring PN activity in a mere ∼50 dimensional space. To achieve this, we expressed the calcium sensor GCaMP6f (Chen et al., 2013Chen T.-W. Wardill T.J. Sun Y. Pulver S.R. Renninger S.L. Baohan A. Schreiter E.R. Kerr R.A. Orger M.B.

GCaMP fluorescence in the entire AL was imaged at ∼1.7 Hz using two-photon microscopy in response to the 84 odors in our dataset. To account for brain movement during recordings and variability in AL morphology across animals, we registered all images to a template AL (Figure 2B), and the fluorescence in each glomerulus was extracted by averaging over the spatial extent of the corresponding glomerulus in the template (Figure S3). Consistent with previous reports, glomeruli exhibited various tuning breadths: a glomerulus responded on average to 22% ± 16% (mean ± SD) of all tested odors. Similarly, odors recruited on average 8 ± 5 of the 37 glomeruli (Figures 2C and 2D). The rapidity of aversive responses suggests that animals rely on the instantaneous, spatial dimension of PN responses to make perceptual decisions. This requires that a single “snapshot” of the PN response contain sufficient information to categorize odorants. To verify this, we trained a linear classifier to predict odor identity based on PN responses in a single imaging frame. Because each odor was presented four times in each animal, we used data from three trials to train the classifier and the remaining trial to test classification performance. As expected, classification accuracy was close to chance level before odor application, and increased shortly after odor onset (∼150 ms after odor contact; Figure 2E), peaking near 65% over time (∼1.3–3.7 s after odor contact). It is worth noting that the onset of this increase in classification accuracy matches well with the onset of the aversive response. Performance decayed after odor offset; however, it remained well above chance level throughout the recording period (13 s beyond odor offset), suggesting that residual PN responses carry a significant amount of information about past stimuli. Comparing behavioral and imaging data showed that PN responses in a number of glomeruli exhibited significant linear correlations with VI (Figure S4), suggesting some degree of linearity in the transformation from PN responses to behavior. The total AL activity, however, only correlated weakly with behavior (Figure S4), indicating that the intensity of AL activation is not the sole determinant of odor valence. To examine the relationship in more detail, we focused on mixture data and asked whether behavioral and physiological responses vary in proportion to the mixing ratio of the components. VI scaled linearly with the mixing ratio (Figure 3A). This trend was paralleled in PN activity: linearly regressing the vectors of PN responses on the mixing ratio lead to a very accurate description of PN data (R2 of fit 0.6–0.97; Figure 3B). These results suggest a linear relationship between PN responses and behavior. Linear models are widely used to examine the relationships between neuronal activity and behavior. In larval Drosophila, a linear model based on the activity of ORNs was successful in predicting behavioral responses to a panel of 26 odorants (Kreher et al., 2008Kreher S.A. Mathew D. Kim J. Carlson J.R. Translation of sensory input into behavioral output via an olfactory system.Neuron. 2008; 59: 110-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). To test whether this framework could explain our data quantitatively, we constructed a decoding model (referred to as linear model) in which the VI is calculated as a weighted sum of glomerular activity (Figure 4A). We fit the model parameters using regularized linear regression (see Experimental Procedures) with training data, and examined its predictive power with test data not used in the fitting procedure. Prediction performance was evaluated using the R2 coefficient (see Experimental Procedures). Unexpectedly, we found that while the model could accurately describe the training data, it performed poorly at predicting the test data (Figure 4B). We reasoned that a possible cause for the failure of the linear model is that odorants were delivered in sets of six in our experiments: the response to one of the odors in the set may be affected by the experience of the other five odors, for example, through sensory adaptation. To test this, we constructed a second decoding model (referred to as normalization model) in which glomerular outputs were passed through a nonlinear normalization step before the summation (Figure 4A). Normalization is meant to represent adaptation to the statistics of the olfactory environment and was minimally modeled using a mean subtraction followed by a rescaling by the SD of each glomerulus’ response to the odor set, both of which commonly describe neuronal adaptation (Baccus and Meister, 2002Baccus S.A.

Sclar G. Freeman R.D. Contrast gain control in the cat’s visual system.J. Neurophysiol. 1985; 54: 651-667PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, this form of normalization is compatible with the linearity observed in response to mixtures. We fit the model parameters using the same procedure as for the linear model. Notably, we found that the normalization model not only accurately described the training data, but also yielded accurate predictions of the test data (Figure 4B). This prediction performance was highly significant (permutation test, p < 0.002), suggesting that the normalization operation renders the relationship between the predictors (glomerular activation) and the dependent variable (VI) more linear. We next tested how the performance varied with the number of glomeruli included in the list of predictors. Because sampling all possible subsets of 37 glomeruli would be computationally prohibitive, we tested instead a multitude (742,700) of randomly chosen subsets. The average prediction performance increased monotonically with the number of glomeruli (Figure 4C, top graph). Importantly, even when restricted to only the best subset of each size (Figure 4C, bottom graph; see Supplemental Experimental Procedures for definition of best subsets), the performance continuously increased up to intermediate sizes (∼20 glomeruli) before slight overfitting occurred. These results suggest that the majority of glomeruli carry information about the dependent variable. A final model was constructed by averaging the sets of glomerulus weights obtained in the cross-validation procedure. This resulted in a balanced number of 18 attractive and 19 aversive glomeruli (Figure 4D). We confirmed that the model accurately explained the responses to pure odors and mixtures (Figure 4E), and further challenged the model with an additional set of test data consisting of four odors at three different concentrations. Again, while the linear model failed to predict these data quantitatively, the normalization model gave accurate predictions (Figure 4E). These results demonstrate strong correlation, but not causality, between glomerular response and behavioral output. To test the causal relationship, it is necessary to perturb glomerular activity and assess the impact of the manipulation on the behavior. To achieve this in a highly glomerulus-specific manner, we genetically silenced synaptic input to glomeruli by expressing tetanus toxin (TNT), a potent blocker of vesicular release (Sweeney et al., 1995Sweeney S.T. Broadie K. Keane J. Niemann H. O’Kane C.J. Targeted expression of tetanus toxin light chain in Drosophila specifically eliminates synaptic transmission and causes behavioral defects.Neuron. 1995; 14: 341-351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar), in ORNs using Or-Gal4 drivers, which drive virtually no expression outside the target ORNs (Couto et al., 2005Couto A.

Genetic and functional subdivision of the Drosophila antennal lobe.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1548-1553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). We targeted five different glomeruli: DM1, DM4, DM5, DC3, and VC1. These particular glomeruli were chosen in part on the basis of their established attractive or aversive role, and partly based on the predictions of our model. In an attempt to evoke larger effects, we tested two lines in which TNT was co-expressed in three different ORN types. A first set (glomerulus DM5, DC3, and VC1) was chosen to evoke changes toward more attractive VI values and a second set (glomerulus DM4, VA2, and VA4) was selected to induce more aversive responses. A number of results supported the conclusion that behavior is determined by the summed activity of many glomeruli. First, in accordance with the prediction that blocking input to a small number of glomeruli should have limited behavioral effect, VIs in flies expressing TNT in one or three glomeruli were not substantially different from those in the control flies (Figure 5A). Notably, blockade of synaptic transmission in DM1 or DM5 ORNs, which abolished attraction or aversion to different concentrations of apple cider vinegar in walking flies (Semmelhack and Wang, 2009Semmelhack J.L. Wang J.W. Select Drosophila glomeruli mediate innate olfactory attraction and aversion.Nature. 2009; 459: 218-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), did not remove innate responses to this as well as other odors in our experiments (Figure 5A). To rule out the possibility of an incomplete effect of TNT, we expressed TNT in either DM1 or DM5 ORNs while expressing GCaMP3 (Tian et al., 2009Tian L. Hires S.A. Mao T. Huber D. Chiappe M.E.

We identified a SIRT6 mutant (G60A) that possesses efficient defatty-acylase activity but has substantially decreased deacetylase activity in vitro and no detectable deacetylase activity in cells. The G60A mutant has a decreased ability to bind NAD(+), but the presence of fatty-acyl lysine peptides restores NAD(+) binding, explaining the retention of the defatty-acylase activity. Using this mutant, we found that the defatty-acylase activity of SIRT6 regulates the secretion of numerous proteins. Notably, many ribosomal proteins were secreted via exosomes from Sirt6 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and these exosomes increased NIH 3T3 cell proliferation compared with control exosomes. Our data indicate that distinct activities of SIRT6 regulate different pathways and that the G60A mutant is a useful tool to study the contribution of defatty-acylase activity to SIRT6's various functions."

The psychometric properties are the basis of the extensive use of these instruments such as the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC). For this study, Sina Weibo statuses were analyzed via rater coding and Simplified Chinese version of LIWC (SCLIWC), in order to evaluate the validity of SCLIWC in detecting psychological expressions in Weibo statuses (n = 60) and in identifying the psychological meaning of a single Weibo status (n = 11). Significant correlations between human ratings and SCLIWC scores and the high sensitivities of capturing single statuses with certain expressions identified by raters, proved the validity of SCLIWC in detecting psychological expressions. The results also suggested that, the efficiency of SCLIWC in detecting psychological expressions of SNS short texts could be higher if using status count scoring method, rather than the word count method as the common usage of LIWC. However, SCLIWC may not perform well in identifying the psychological meaning of a single piece of SNS short text because of its over-identification of target expressions. This study provided primary evidence of validity of SCLIWC, as well as the proper way of using it efficiently on SNS short texts."
https://openalex.org/W2441946812,"Persistent accumulation of misfolded proteins causes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, a prominent feature in many neurodegenerative diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Here we report the identification of homeodomain interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) as the essential link that promotes ER-stress-induced cell death via the IRE1α-ASK1-JNK pathway. ER stress, induced by tunicamycin or SOD1G93A, activates HIPK2 by phosphorylating highly conserved serine and threonine residues (S359/T360) within the activation loop of the HIPK2 kinase domain. In SOD1G93A mice, loss of HIPK2 delays disease onset, reduces cell death in spinal motor neurons, mitigates glial pathology, and improves survival. Remarkably, HIPK2 activation positively correlates with TDP-43 proteinopathy in NEFH-tTA/tetO-hTDP-43ΔNLS mice, sporadic ALS and C9ORF72 ALS, and blocking HIPK2 kinase activity protects motor neurons from TDP-43 cytotoxicity. These results reveal a previously unrecognized role of HIPK2 activation in ER-stress-mediated neurodegeneration and its potential role as a biomarker and therapeutic target for ALS.Video AbstracteyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiI0YzQ2MTQ4OTNlZmMwMzQ4Zjg1YTllYTg1ZDgwZjg3ZSIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc5MjcyMzQyfQ.Jc2bvI18MfHcnVnpiyrHxQ7skURgQM6QWO_qWJo5qBJTId3L2yOUdT3DPRjaCvh8sxh2DQP8WEKxx6vI94e39ruFgj2X8_ZjqPJYxvaPRNZbIaTWPbiRDRk4gKOuI_fVk3_YoMpFip44pnZ3_IQ46EORRCwu50MWFFHykKSSSrQGxZg718_HhkIPVEfpEU8UL-Gp6nKXuQ6JMd5FQzuuYcp4nVAJHezM0RETmwYowXxT59p8ecwxqYZMZ4fImDV40gmO3zamI8On4d1ktDDLc0pdkb-2bqj_FsR0CLmLKbpV_alpcKy8P3CQvuwQMN3PYYPHEjcf96NLBWSYFEvHMw(mp4, (5.83 MB) Download video"
https://openalex.org/W2431280174,"Noxious pH triggers pungent taste and nocifensive behavior. While the mechanisms underlying acidic pH sensation have been extensively characterized, little is known about how animals sense alkaline pH in the environment. TMC genes encode a family of evolutionarily conserved membrane proteins whose functions are largely unknown. Here, we characterize C. elegans TMC-1, which was suggested to form a Na+-sensitive channel mediating salt chemosensation. Interestingly, we find that TMC-1 is required for worms to avoid noxious alkaline environment. Alkaline pH evokes an inward current in nociceptive neurons, which is primarily mediated by TMC-1 and to a lesser extent by the TRP channel OSM-9. However, unlike OSM-9, which is sensitive to both acidic and alkaline pH, TMC-1 is only required for alkali-activated current, revealing a specificity for alkaline sensation. Ectopic expression of TMC-1 confers alkaline sensitivity to alkali-insensitive cells. Our results identify an unexpected role for TMCs in alkaline sensation and nociception."

Hsp90 functions as a molecular clamp that closes and opens in response to the binding and hydrolysis of ATP. Crystallographic studies have defined distinct conformational states of the mechanistic core, implying structural changes that have not yet been observed in solution. Here we engineered one-nanometer fluorescence probes based on photoinduced electron transfer into the yeast Hsp90 to observe these motions. We found that the ATPase activity of the chaperone was reflected in the kinetics of specific structural rearrangements at remote positions that acted cooperatively. Nanosecond single-molecule fluorescence fluctuation analysis uncovered that critical structural elements that undergo rearrangement were mobile on a sub-millisecond time scale. We identified a two-step mechanism for lid closure over the nucleotide-binding pocket.

In the present study, we use neuron-specific approaches to test the following two hypotheses: (1) a postsynaptic AMPK → PAK pathway drives state-dependent excitatory synaptic plasticity in AgRP neurons, and (2) the plasticity brought about by this AMPK → PAK pathway accounts for effects of AMPK on energy balance. AMPK activity in the hypothalamus, including the arcuate nucleus (ARC), is higher in fasted versus refed mice (Minokoshi et al., 2004Minokoshi Y. Alquier T. Furukawa N. Kim Y.B. Lee A. Xue B. Mu J. Foufelle F. Ferré P. Birnbaum M.J. et al.AMP-kinase regulates food intake by responding to hormonal and nutrient signals in the hypothalamus.Nature. 2004; 428: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). However, since AgRP neurons are just one of many subpopulations of neurons in the ARC, and since the other neurons have opposite or unrelated functions, it is unknown if fasting increases AMPK activity specifically in AgRP neurons. To monitor activity selectively in AgRP neurons, we constructed a cre-dependent adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing FLAG-tagged α2 AMPK (Figure 1A) and stereotaxically injected it into the ARC of Agrp-IRES-Cre mice (Figure 1B). Mice were then studied in the fed or fasted state (food was removed at 9 a.m. and assays were performed 24 hr later). AgRP neuron-specific α2 AMPK was then immunoprecipitated (Figure 1C) and assayed for kinase activity as described previously (Dagon et al., 2012Dagon Y. Hur E. Zheng B. Wellenstein K. Cantley L.C. Kahn B.B. p70S6 kinase phosphorylates AMPK on serine 491 to mediate leptin’s effect on food intake.Cell Metab. 2012; 16: 104-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, Minokoshi et al., 2004Minokoshi Y.

Birnbaum M.J. et al.AMP-kinase regulates food intake by responding to hormonal and nutrient signals in the hypothalamus.Nature. 2004; 428: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). Of note, AMPK activity was increased more than 2-fold in AgRP neurons of fasted versus fed mice (Figure 1D). Thus, marked fasting-feeding regulation of AMPK occurs specifically in AgRP neurons. To stimulate AMPK selectively in AgRP neurons, we constructed and stereotaxically injected cre-dependent AAV co-expressing mCherry and a constitutively active (CA) mutant (H150R) of the γ1 subunit of AMPK (Minokoshi et al., 2004Minokoshi Y. Alquier T. Furukawa N. Kim Y.B. Lee A. Xue B. Mu J. Foufelle F. Ferré P. Birnbaum M.J. et al.AMP-kinase regulates food intake by responding to hormonal and nutrient signals in the hypothalamus.Nature. 2004; 428: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar) into the ARC of Agrp-IRES-Cre mice (Figures 1E and 1F). We chose this mutant over CA truncated α2 AMPK lacking the autoinhibitory domain (AID) to preserve the normal subcellular localization of activated AMPK. Expression occurred in a pattern consistent with AgRP neurons (Figure 1G) and increased α2 AMPK activity in the ARC (Figure 1H). To assess effects of AMPK activation on synaptic plasticity, we injected AAV-DIO-CA-AMPK unilaterally into the ARC of Agrp-IRES-Cre, Npy-hrGFP mice (Figure 1I) and then assessed various parameters, within the same mice in the ad libitum fed state, in CA-AMPK-expressing (mCherry+, hrGFP+) versus “control” non-expressing (hrGFP+) AgRP neurons (Figure 1J). As AgRP neurons co-express neuropeptide Y (NPY), the Npy-hrGFP BAC transgene allows visualization of AgRP neurons (van den Pol et al., 2009van den Pol A.N. Yao Y. Fu L.Y. Foo K. Huang H. Coppari R. Lowell B.B. Broberger C. Neuromedin B and gastrin-releasing peptide excite ARC neuropeptide Y neurons in a novel transgenic mouse expressing strong Renilla green fluorescent protein in NPY neurons.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 4622-4639Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). We employed two-photon laser scanning microscopy combined with whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology (Kozorovitskiy et al., 2012Kozorovitskiy Y. Saunders A. Johnson C.A. Lowell B.B. Sabatini B.L. Recurrent network activity drives striatal synaptogenesis.Nature. 2012; 485: 646-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) to analyze synaptic plasticity of AgRP neurons (Figure 1K). CA-AMPK expression in fed mice increased dendritic spines (Figures 1L and 1M) and the frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) (Figures 1N and 1O), but not their amplitude (Figure 1P). CA-AMPK expression also activated AgRP neurons, as judged by their depolarization (Figures 1Q and 1R) and increased firing rate (Figures 1Q and 1S). Furthermore, in animals bilaterally injected with AAV-DIO-CA-AMPK, the amount of food eaten (Figure 1T), body weight (Figure 1U), and body fat (Figure 1V) also increased. Thus, activation of AMPK in AgRP neurons increases dendritic spines and excitatory synaptic transmission, AgRP neuron firing rate, and consequently hunger. To inhibit AMPK activity selectively in AgRP neurons, we next constructed and stereotaxically injected cre-dependent AAV co-expressing mCherry and dominant negative (DN) kinase dead (K45R) α2 AMPK (Minokoshi et al., 2004Minokoshi Y. Alquier T. Furukawa N. Kim Y.B. Lee A. Xue B. Mu J. Foufelle F. Ferré P. Birnbaum M.J. et al.AMP-kinase regulates food intake by responding to hormonal and nutrient signals in the hypothalamus.Nature. 2004; 428: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar) into the ARC of Agrp-IRES-Cre mice (Figures 2A and 2B ). Expression occurred in a pattern consistent with AgRP neurons (Figure 2C) and lowered total α2 AMPK activity in the ARC (Figure 2D) where AgRP neurons are located. Of note, DN-AMPK expression did not cause death of AgRP neurons (Figure S1, available online). To assess effects of AMPK inhibition on synaptic plasticity, we injected AAV-DIO-DN-AMPK unilaterally into the ARC of Agrp-IRES-Cre, Npy-hrGFP mice (Figure 2E) and then assessed various parameters, within the same mice, in DN-AMPK-expressing (mCherry+, hrGFP+) versus control non-expressing (hrGFP+) AgRP neurons (Figure 2F). In control AgRP neurons, as previously observed (Liu et al., 2012Liu T. Kong D. Shah B.P. Ye C. Koda S. Saunders A. Ding J.B. Yang Z. Sabatini B.L. Lowell B.B. Fasting activation of AgRP neurons requires NMDA receptors and involves spinogenesis and increased excitatory tone.Neuron. 2012; 73: 511-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), fasting increased dendritic spines (Figures 2G and 2H) and the frequency of mEPSCs (Figures 2I and 2J), but not their amplitude (Figure 2K). Fasting also activated control AgRP neurons, as judged by their depolarization (Figures 2L and 2M), and increased firing rate (Figures 2L and 2N). Notably, these effects of fasting on both synaptic plasticity and activation of AgRP neurons were absent in DN-AMPK-expressing AgRP neurons (Figure 2G–2N). Also, in animals bilaterally injected with AAV-DIO-DN-AMPK, the amount of food eaten following 24 hr fasting was reduced (Figure 2O). Thus, activation of AMPK in AgRP neurons is both sufficient (CA-AMPK studies; Figure 1) and necessary (DN-AMPK studies; Figure 2) for fasting-induced effects on plasticity, AgRP neuron activation, and consequently hunger. We then considered AMPK targets that could regulate synaptic plasticity. A recent unbiased screen for α2 AMPK substrates identified p21-activated protein kinase (specifically the PAK2 isoform) (Banko et al., 2011Banko M.R. Allen J.J. Schaffer B.E. Wilker E.W. Tsou P.

PAKs are serine/threonine kinases regulated by GTPases of the Rac1 and Cdc42 family (Bokoch, 2003Bokoch G.M. Biology of the p21-activated kinases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 743-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). The group 1 members of PAKs (PAKs 1, 2, and 3) are typified by a common N-terminal AID and are highly homologous throughout (Bokoch, 2003Bokoch G.M. Biology of the p21-activated kinases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 743-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). AMPK phosphorylates serine 20 of PAK2, and this appears to be necessary for AMPK-induced phosphorylation of the PAK2 substrate, myosin regulatory light chain (MRLC) (Banko et al., 2011Banko M.R. Allen J.J. Schaffer B.E. Wilker E.W. Tsou P. White J.L. Villén J. Wang B. Kim S.R.

Cell. 2011; 44: 878-892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Of note, a phosphorylation site mapping program (http://scansite.mit.edu) strongly suggests that AMPK also phosphorylates PAK1 (on serine-21), but likely not PAK3 (on serine-20), which lacks an AMPK phosphorylation consensus motif (Banko et al., 2011Banko M.R. Allen J.J. Schaffer B.E. Wilker E.W. Tsou P. White J.L. Villén J. Wang B. Kim S.R.

Cell. 2011; 44: 878-892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). We performed RT-PCR on disassociated, single AgRP neurons and detected Pak1, Pak2, and Pak3 mRNAs, respectively, in 100%, 50%, and 90% of AgRP neurons (Figure 3A). We focused our efforts on PAK2 because of the availability of reagents that readily detect its serine-20 phosphorylation, and prior work establishing that it is a downstream target of AMPK (Banko et al., 2011Banko M.R. Allen J.J. Schaffer B.E. Wilker E.W. Tsou P. White J.L. Villén J. Wang B. Kim S.R. Sakamoto K. et al.Chemical genetic screen for AMPKα2 substrates uncovers a network of proteins involved in mitosis.Mol. Cell. 2011; 44: 878-892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In the ARC, fasting, which increases AMPK activity (Figure 3B), increased serine-20 phosphorylation of PAK2 (Figure 3C) and also threonine-508/505 phosphorylation of the PAK target, LIM kinase 2 (LIMK2) (Figure 3D). Of note, this fasting-induced increase in LIMK phosphorylation occurred specifically in AgRP neurons (Figure 3E). Importantly, PAK2 co-precipitates with α2 AMPK from protein lysates of the ARC, indicating that the two interact in cells within the ARC (Figure 3F). We next injected into the mediobasal hypothalamus an adenovirus expressing, independently of cre, HA-tagged CA-γ1 AMPK (Minokoshi et al., 2004Minokoshi Y. Alquier T. Furukawa N. Kim Y.B. Lee A. Xue B. Mu J. Foufelle F. Ferré P. Birnbaum M.J. et al.AMP-kinase regulates food intake by responding to hormonal and nutrient signals in the hypothalamus.Nature. 2004; 428: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 3G, CA-γ1 AMPK in the hypothalamus increased phosphorylation of PAK2 and LIMK2. We further constructed an AAV viral vector expressing DN-AMPK and mCherry independently of cre and similarly injected it into the mediobasal hypothalamus (Figure 3H). As shown in Figures 3I–3K, hypothalamic expression of DN-AMPK significantly attenuated fasting-induced phosphorylation of LIMK2, as evidenced by either immunofluorescence (Figures 3I and 3J) or western blotting (Figure 3K). Thus, increased AMPK activity is required for fasting-induced phosphorylation of the major PAK target, LIMK2. Using the immortalized hypothalamic cell line, GT1-7 (Mellon et al., 1990Mellon P.L. Windle J.J. Goldsmith P.C. Padula C.A. Roberts J.L. Weiner R.I. Immortalization of hypothalamic GnRH neurons by genetically targeted tumorigenesis.Neuron. 1990; 5: 1-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar), we confirmed that two known activators of AMPK, reduced energy state (glucose starvation) and a cell-permeable AMP analog (AICAR), increased serine-20 phosphorylation of PAK2 (Figure 3L) and phosphorylation of acetyl CoA carboxylase on the well-known AMPK phosphorylation site. Likewise, expression of CA-AMPK also increased serine-20 phosphorylation (Figure 3M). Finally, AMPK activation by AICAR increased phosphorylation of the PAK2 target, LIMK2 (Figure 3N; “Empty” lanes), and overexpression of wild-type PAK2 greatly augmented this effect (Figure 3N; PAK2WT lanes). Importantly, this augmentation was not seen following overexpression of a phospho-defective S20A mutant of PAK2 (Figure 3N; PAK2S20A lanes). In total, these studies and those of Banko et al. (Banko et al., 2011Banko M.R. Allen J.J. Schaffer B.E. Wilker E.W. Tsou P. White J.L. Villén J. Wang B. Kim S.R.

Cell. 2011; 44: 878-892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) demonstrate that AMPK phosphorylates serine-20 on PAK2, that this is associated with increased phosphorylation of the PAK2 targets LIMK2 (this study) and MRLC (Banko et al., 2011Banko M.R. Allen J.J. Schaffer B.E. Wilker E.W. Tsou P. White J.L. Villén J. Wang B. Kim S.R.

Cell. 2011; 44: 878-892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), and that the ability of serine 20 to be phosphorylated by AMPK is necessary for AMPK-induced increased activity of PAK2 on LIMK2 (this study) and MRLC (Banko et al., 2011Banko M.R. Allen J.J. Schaffer B.E. Wilker E.W. Tsou P. White J.L. Villén J. Wang B. Kim S.R.

Cell. 2011; 44: 878-892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Furthermore, our study demonstrates that AMPK regulation of PAK2 occurs in neurons. Of note, given the sequence homology between PAK1 and PAK2, such AMPK regulation may also occur for PAK1, which was not assessed in the current study due to unavailability of antibodies against serine-21 phosphorylated PAK1. Since all three PAKs are expressed in AgRP neurons (Figure 3A) and since PAK1, in addition to PAK2, could mediate the effects of AMPK on synaptic plasticity in AgRP neurons, we generated a cre-dependent AAV co-expressing EGFP and the AID of PAK1(DN-PAK) (Figure 4A ). Of note, overexpressed DN-PAK binds to the catalytic domain of all three group 1 PAKs, preventing their activation (Hayashi et al., 2004Hayashi M.L. Choi S.Y. Rao B.S. Jung H.Y. Lee H.K. Zhang D. Chattarji S. Kirkwood A. Tonegawa S. Altered cortical synaptic morphology and impaired memory consolidation in forebrain- specific dominant-negative PAK transgenic mice.Neuron. 2004; 42: 773-787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Hence, DN-PAK will inhibit all three PAKs in AgRP neurons. This DN-PAK virus was then stereotaxically injected into the ARC of Agrp-IRES-Cre mice (Figure 4B). Expression of AAV-DIO-DN-PAK, as indicated by EGFP fluorescence, occurred in a pattern consistent with AgRP neurons (Figure 4C). To assess effects of PAK inhibition on synaptic plasticity, we injected AAV-DIO-DN-PAK into the ARC of Agrp-IRES-Cre mice and assessed various parameters, in the fasted state, in DN-PAK-expressing neurons. Control AgRP neurons for these studies were from uninjected fasted Npy-hrGFP mice. Of note, PAK inhibition of AgRP neurons in fasted mice decreased dendritic spines (Figures 4D and 4E) and greatly reduced the frequency of mEPSCs (Figures 4F and 4G), but not their amplitude (Figure 4H). In addition, PAK inhibition decreased the activity of AgRP neurons, as judged by their hyperpolarization (Figures 4I and 4J), and decreased firing rate (Figure 4K). To determine if PAK activity was required for AMPK’s effects on plasticity, we injected one side of the ARC with AAV-DIO-CA-AMPK alone and the other with a 1:1 mix of both AAV-DIO-CA-AMPK and AAV-DIO-DN-PAK (Figures 4L and 4M). Importantly, in ad libitum fed Agrp-IRES-Cre mice, the ability of CA-AMPK to increase mEPSC frequency (Figure 4O, left bar, CA-AMPK alone, as previously seen in Figure 1O) was blocked by simultaneous inhibition of PAK"
https://openalex.org/W2461324679,"WRKY transcription factors play important roles in responses to environmental stress stimuli. Using a genome-wide domain analysis, we identified 287 WRKY genes with 343 WRKY domains in the sequenced genome of Brassica napus, 139 in the A sub-genome and 148 in the C sub-genome. These genes were classified into eight groups based on phylogenetic analysis. In the 343 WRKY domains, a total of 26 members showed divergence in the WRKY domain, and 21 belonged to group I. This finding suggested that WRKY genes in group I are more active and variable compared with genes in other groups. Using genome-wide identification and analysis of the WRKY gene family in Brassica napus, we observed genome duplication, chromosomal/segmental duplications and tandem duplication. All of these duplications contributed to the expansion of the WRKY gene family. The duplicate segments that were detected indicated that genome duplication events occurred in the two diploid progenitors B. rapa and B. olearecea before they combined to form B. napus. Analysis of the public microarray database and EST database for B. napus indicated that 74 WRKY genes were induced or preferentially expressed under stress conditions. According to the public QTL data, we identified 77 WRKY genes in 31 QTL regions related to various stress tolerance. We further evaluated the expression of 26 BnaWRKY genes under multiple stresses by qRT-PCR. Most of the genes were induced by low temperature, salinity and drought stress, indicating that the WRKYs play important roles in B. napus stress responses. Further, three BnaWRKY genes were strongly responsive to the three multiple stresses simultaneously, which suggests that these 3 WRKY may have multi-functional roles in stress tolerance and can potentially be used in breeding new rapeseed cultivars. We also found six tandem repeat pairs exhibiting similar expression profiles under the various stress conditions, and three pairs were mapped in the stress related QTL regions, indicating tandem duplicate WRKYs in the adaptive responses to environmental stimuli during the evolution process. Our results provide a framework for future studies regarding the function of WRKY genes in response to stress in B. napus."
https://openalex.org/W2465440697,"Introduction To observe the early change of metabolic tumor heterogeneity during chemoradiotherapy and to determine its prognostic value for patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods From January 2007 to March 2010, 58 patients with NSCLC were included who were received 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET/CT before and following 40 Gy radiotherapy with the concurrent cisplatin-based chemotherapy (CCRT). Primary tumor FDG uptake heterogeneity was determined using global and local scale textural features extracted from standardized uptake value (SUV) histogram analysis (coefficient of variation [COV], skewness, kurtosis, area under the curve of the cumulative SUV histogram [AUC-CSH]) and normalized gray-level co-occurrence matrix (contrast, dissimilarity, entropy, homogeneity). SUVmax and metabolic tumor volume (MTV) were also evaluated. Correlations were analyzed between parameters on baseline or during treatments with tumor response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Results Compared with non-responders, responders showed significantly greater pre-treatment COV, contrast and MTV (AUC = 0.781, 0.804, 0.686, respectively). Receiver-operating-characteristic curve analysis showed that early change of tumor textural analysis serves as a response predictor with higher sensitivity (73.2%~92.1%) and specificity (80.0%~83.6%) than baseline parameters. Change in AUC-CSH and dissimilarity during CCRT could also predict response with optimal cut-off values (33.0% and 28.7%, respectively). The patients with greater changes in contrast and AUC-CSH had significantly higher 5-year OS (P = 0.008, P = 0.034) and PFS (P = 0.007, P = 0.039). In multivariate analysis, only change in contrast was found as the independent prognostic factor of PFS (HR 0.476, P = 0.021) and OS (HR 0.519, P = 0.015). Conclusions The metabolic tumor heterogeneity change during CCRT characterized by global and local scale textural features may be valuable for predicting treatment response and survival for patients with locally advanced NSCLC."
https://openalex.org/W2434115490,"Corticothalamic projection neurons (CThPN) are a diverse set of neurons, critical for function of the neocortex. CThPN development and diversity need to be precisely regulated, but little is known about molecular controls over their differentiation and functional specialization, critically limiting understanding of cortical development and complexity. We report the identification of a set of genes that both define CThPN and likely control their differentiation, diversity, and function. We selected the CThPN-specific transcriptional coregulator Fog2 for functional analysis. We identify that Fog2 controls CThPN molecular differentiation, axonal targeting, and diversity, in part by regulating the expression level of Ctip2 by CThPN, via combinatorial interactions with other molecular controls. Loss of Fog2 specifically disrupts differentiation of subsets of CThPN specialized in motor function, indicating that Fog2 coordinates subtype and functional-area differentiation. These results confirm that we identified key controls over CThPN development and identify Fog2 as a critical control over CThPN diversity."
https://openalex.org/W2471994457,"Characterization of three DUF89 subfamilies representing all domains of life reveals that members function as metal-dependent phosphatases that help eliminate a wide range of damaged phosphometabolites. DUF89 family proteins occur widely in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, but their functions are unknown. Here we define three DUF89 subfamilies (I, II, and III), with subfamily II being split into stand-alone proteins and proteins fused to pantothenate kinase (PanK). We demonstrated that DUF89 proteins have metal-dependent phosphatase activity against reactive phosphoesters or their damaged forms, notably sugar phosphates (subfamilies II and III), phosphopantetheine and its S-sulfonate or sulfonate (subfamily II-PanK fusions), and nucleotides (subfamily I). Genetic and comparative genomic data strongly associated DUF89 genes with phosphoester metabolism. The crystal structure of the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) subfamily III protein YMR027W revealed a novel phosphatase active site with fructose 6-phosphate and Mg2+ bound near conserved signature residues Asp254 and Asn255 that are critical for activity. These findings indicate that DUF89 proteins are previously unrecognized hydrolases whose characteristic in vivo function is to limit potentially harmful buildups of normal or damaged phosphometabolites."
https://openalex.org/W2462073641,"Atypical protein kinase Cι (PKCι) is an oncogene in lung and ovarian cancer. The PKCι gene PRKCI is targeted for frequent tumor-specific copy number gain (CNG) in both lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) and ovarian serous carcinoma (OSC). We recently demonstrated that in LSCC cells PRKCI CNG functions to drive transformed growth and tumorigenicity by activating PKCι-dependent cell autonomous Hedgehog (Hh) signaling. Here, we assessed whether OSC cells harboring PRKCI CNG exhibit similar PKCι-dependent Hh signaling. Surprisingly, we find that whereas PKCι is required for the transformed growth of OSC cells harboring PRKCI CNG, these cells do not exhibit PKCι-dependent Hh signaling or Hh-dependent proliferation. Rather, transformed growth of OSC cells is regulated by PKCι-dependent nuclear localization of the oncogenic transcription factor, YAP1. Lentiviral shRNA-mediated knockdown (KD) of PKCι leads to decreased nuclear YAP1 and increased YAP1 binding to angiomotin (AMOT), which sequesters YAP1 in the cytoplasm. Biochemical analysis reveals that PKCι directly phosphorylates AMOT at a unique site, Thr750, whose phosphorylation inhibits YAP1 binding. Pharmacologic inhibition of PKCι decreases YAP1 nuclear localization and blocks OSC tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Immunohistochemical analysis reveals a strong positive correlation between tumor PKCι expression and nuclear YAP1 in primary OSC tumor samples, indicating the clinical relevance of PKCι-YAP1 signaling. Our results uncover a novel PKCι-AMOT-YAP1 signaling axis that promotes OSC tumor growth, and provide a rationale for therapeutic targeting of this pathway for treatment of OSC."

https://openalex.org/W2465985002,"Genomic selection is focused on prediction of breeding values of selection candidates by means of high density of markers. It relies on the assumption that all quantitative trait loci (QTLs) tend to be in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) with at least one marker. In this context, we present theoretical results regarding the accuracy of genomic selection, i.e., the correlation between predicted and true breeding values. Typically, for individuals (so-called test individuals), breeding values are predicted by means of markers, using marker effects estimated by fitting a ridge regression model to a set of training individuals. We present a theoretical expression for the accuracy; this expression is suitable for any configurations of LD between QTLs and markers. We also introduce a new accuracy proxy that is free of the QTL parameters and easily computable; it outperforms the proxies suggested in the literature, in particular, those based on an estimated effective number of independent loci (Me). The theoretical formula, the new proxy, and existing proxies were compared for simulated data, and the results point to the validity of our approach. The calculations were also illustrated on a new perennial ryegrass set (367 individuals) genotyped for 24,957 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In this case, most of the proxies studied yielded similar results because of the lack of markers for coverage of the entire genome (2.7 Gb)."
https://openalex.org/W2471304467,"Rapid accumulation and availability of gene expression datasets in public repositories have enabled large-scale meta-analyses of combined data. The richness of cross-experiment data has provided new biological insights, including identification of new cancer genes. In this study, we compiled a human gene expression dataset from ∼40,000 publicly available Affymetrix HG-U133Plus2 arrays. After strict quality control and data normalisation the data was quantified in an expression matrix of ∼20,000 genes and ∼28,000 samples. To enable different ways of sample grouping, existing annotations where subjected to systematic ontology assisted categorisation and manual curation. Groups like normal tissues, neoplasmic tissues, cell lines, homoeotic cells and incompletely differentiated cells were created. Unsupervised analysis of the data confirmed global structure of expression consistent with earlier analysis but with more details revealed due to increased resolution. A suitable mixed-effects linear model was used to further investigate gene expression in solid tissue tumours, and to compare these with the respective healthy solid tissues. The analysis identified 1,285 genes with systematic expression change in cancer. The list is significantly enriched with known cancer genes from large, public, peer-reviewed databases, whereas the remaining ones are proposed as new cancer gene candidates. The compiled dataset is publicly available in the ArrayExpress Archive. It contains the most diverse collection of biological samples, making it the largest systematically annotated gene expression dataset of its kind in the public domain."
https://openalex.org/W2463489502,"Adenovirus is one of the most important causative agents of iatrogenic infections derived from contaminated medical devices or finger contact. In this study, we investigated whether nitrogen gas plasma, generated by applying a short high-voltage pulse to nitrogen using a static induction thyristor power supply (1.5 kilo pulse per second), exhibited a virucidal effect against adenoviruses. Viral titer was reduced by one log within 0.94 min. Results from detection of viral capsid proteins, hexon and penton, by Western blotting and immunochromatography were unaffected by the plasma treatment. In contrast, analysis using the polymerase chain reaction suggested that plasma treatment damages the viral genomic DNA. Reactive chemical products (hydrogen peroxide, nitrate, and nitrite), ultraviolet light (UV-A) and slight temperature elevations were observed during the operation of the gas plasma device. Viral titer versus intensity of each potential virucidal factor were used to identify the primary mechanism of disinfection of adenovirus. Although exposure to equivalent levels of UV-A or heat treatment did not inactivate adenovirus, treatment with a relatively low concentration of hydrogen peroxide efficiently inactivated the virus. Our results suggest the nitrogen gas plasma generates reactive chemical products that inactivate adenovirus by damaging the viral genomic DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2472440440,"Introduction Tobacco use is associated with insulin resistance and incident diabetes. Given the racial/ethnic differences in smoking patterns and incident type 2 diabetes our objective was to evaluate the association between tobacco use and insulin resistance (IR) as well as incident type 2 diabetes mellitus in a contemporary multiethnic cohort. Methods and Results We studied 5,931 Multi- Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) participants who at baseline were free of type 2 diabetes (fasting glucose ≥7.0 mmol/l (126 mg/dl) and/or use of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications) categorized by self-reported tobacco status and reclassified by urinary cotinine (available in 58% of participants) as never, current or former tobacco users. The association between tobacco use, IR (fasting plasma glucose, insulin, and the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)) and incident diabetes over 10 years was evaluated using multivariable linear regression and Cox proportional hazards models, respectively. Mean age of the participants was 62 (±10) years, 46% were male, 41% Caucasian, 12% Chinese, 26% African American and 21% Hispanic/Latino. IR biomarkers did not significantly differ between current, former, and never cigarette users (P >0.10) but showed limited unadjusted differences for users of cigar, pipe and smokeless tobacco (All P <0.05). Fully adjusted models showed no association between dose or intensity of tobacco exposure and any index of IR. When stratified into participants that quit smoking vs. those who continued smoking during the 10-year study there was no difference in serum glucose levels or frequency of diabetes. In fully adjusted models, there was no significant difference in diabetes risk between former or current cigarette smokers compared to never smokers [HR (95% CI) 1.02 (0.77,1.37) and 0.81 (0.52,1.26) respectively]. Conclusion In a contemporary multi-ethnic cohort, there was no independent association between tobacco use and IR or incident type 2 diabetes. The role smoking plays in causing diabetes may be more complicated than originally thought and warrants more in-depth large contemporary multi-ethnic studies."
https://openalex.org/W2423440312,"Theoretical studies have indicated that nestedness and modularity—non-random structural patterns of ecological networks—influence the stability of ecosystems against perturbations; as such, climate change and human activity, as well as other sources of environmental perturbations, affect the nestedness and modularity of ecological networks. However, the effects of climate change and human activities on ecological networks are poorly understood. Here, we used a spatial analysis approach to examine the effects of climate change and human activities on the structural patterns of food webs and mutualistic networks, and found that ecological network structure is globally affected by climate change and human impacts, in addition to current climate. In pollination networks, for instance, nestedness increased and modularity decreased in response to increased human impacts. Modularity in seed-dispersal networks decreased with temperature change (i.e., warming), whereas food web nestedness increased and modularity declined in response to global warming. Although our findings are preliminary owing to data-analysis limitations, they enhance our understanding of the effects of environmental change on ecological communities."
https://openalex.org/W2435900373,"Beige adipocytes are special cells situated in the white adipose tissue. Beige adipocytes, lacking thermogenic cues, morphologically look quite similar to regular white adipocytes, but with a markedly different response to adrenalin. White adipocytes respond to adrenergic stimuli by enhancing lipolysis, while in beige adipocytes adrenalin induces mitochondrial biogenesis too. A key step in the differentiation and function of beige adipocytes is the deacetylation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARγ) by SIRT1 and the consequent mitochondrial biogenesis. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an upstream activator of SIRT1, therefore we set out to investigate the role of AMPK in beige adipocyte differentiation using human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hADMSCs) from pericardial adipose tissue. hADMSCs were differentiated to white and beige adipocytes and the differentiation medium of the white adipocytes was supplemented with 100 μM [(2R,3S,4R,5R)-5-(4-Carbamoyl-5-aminoimidazol-1-yl)-3,4-dihydroxyoxolan-2-yl]methyl dihydrogen phosphate (AICAR), a known activator of AMPK. The activation of AMPK with AICAR led to the appearance of beige-like morphological properties in differentiated white adipocytes. Namely, smaller lipid droplets appeared in AICAR-treated white adipocytes in a similar fashion as in beige cells. Moreover, in AICAR-treated white adipocytes the mitochondrial network was more fused than in white adipocytes; a fused mitochondrial system was characteristic to beige adipocytes. Despite the morphological similarities between AICAR-treated white adipocytes and beige cells, functionally AICAR-treated white adipocytes were similar to white adipocytes. We were unable to detect increases in basal or cAMP-induced oxygen consumption rate (a marker of mitochondrial biogenesis) when comparing control and AICAR-treated white adipocytes. Similarly, markers of beige adipocytes such as TBX1, UCP1, CIDEA, PRDM16 and TMEM26 remained the same when comparing control and AICAR-treated white adipocytes. Our data point out that in human pericardial hADMSCs the role of AMPK activation in controlling beige differentiation is restricted to morphological features, but not to actual metabolic changes."
https://openalex.org/W2467727256,"Effectors play significant roles in the success of pathogens. Recent advances in genome sequencing have revealed arrays of effectors and effector candidates from a wide range of plant pathogens. Yet, the vast majority of them remain uncharacterized. Among the ~500 Candidate Secreted Effector Proteins (CSEPs) predicted from the barley powdery mildew fungal genome, only a few have been studied and shown to have a function in virulence. Here, we provide evidence that CSEP0081 and CSEP0254 contribute to infection by the fungus. This was studied using Host-Induced Gene Silencing (HIGS), where independent silencing of the transcripts for these CSEPs significantly reduced the fungal penetration and haustoria formation rate. Both CSEPs are likely required during and after the formation of haustoria, in which their transcripts were found to be differentially expressed, rather than in epiphytic tissue. When expressed in barley leaf epidermal cells, both CSEPs appears to move freely between the cytosol and the nucleus, suggesting that their host targets locate in these cellular compartments. Collectively, our data suggest that, in addition to the previously reported effectors, the barley powdery mildew fungus utilizes these two CSEPs as virulence factors to enhance infection."

https://openalex.org/W2468616401,"Antibody-mediated immune effector functions play an essential role in the anti-tumor efficacy of many therapeutic mAbs. While much of the effort to improve effector potency has focused on augmenting the interaction between the antibody-Fc and activating Fc-receptors expressed on immune cells, the role of antibody binding interactions with the target antigen remains poorly understood. We show that antibody intrinsic affinity to the target antigen clearly influences the extent and efficiency of Fc-mediated effector mechanisms, and report the pivotal role of antibody binding valence on the ability to regulate effector functions. More particularly, we used an array of affinity modulated variants of three different mAbs, anti-CD4, anti-EGFR and anti-HER2 against a panel of target cell lines expressing disparate levels of the target antigen. We found that at saturating antibody concentrations, IgG variants with moderate intrinsic affinities, similar to those generated by the natural humoral immune response, promoted superior effector functions compared to higher affinity antibodies. We hypothesize that at saturating concentrations, effector function correlates most directly with the amount of Fc bound to the cell surface. Thus, high affinity antibodies exhibiting slow off-rates are more likely to interact bivalently with the target cell, occupying two antigen sites with a single Fc. In contrast, antibodies with faster off-rates are likely to dissociate each binding arm more rapidly, resulting in a higher likelihood of monovalent binding. Monovalent binding may in turn increase target cell opsonization and lead to improved recruitment of effector cells. This unpredicted relationship between target affinity and effector function potency suggests a careful examination of antibody design and engineering for the development of next-generation immunotherapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2468437291,"Although MUC13, a transmembrane mucin, is aberrantly expressed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and generally correlates with increased expression of HER2, the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Herein, we found that MUC13 co-localizes and interacts with HER2 in PDAC cells (reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, proximity ligation, co-capping assays) and tissues (immunohistofluorescence). The results from this study demonstrate that MUC13 functionally interacts and activates HER2 at p1248 in PDAC cells, leading to stimulation of HER2 signaling cascade, including ERK1/2, FAK, AKT and PAK1 as well as regulation of the growth, cytoskeleton remodeling and motility, invasion of PDAC cells-all collectively contributing to PDAC progression. Interestingly, all of these phenotypic effects of MUC13-HER2 co-localization could be effectively compromised by depleting MUC13 and mediated by the first and second EGF-like domains of MUC13. Further, MUC13-HER2 co-localization also holds true in PDAC tissues with a strong functional correlation with events contributing to increased degree of disorder and cancer aggressiveness. In brief, findings presented here provide compelling evidence of a functional ramification of MUC13-HER2: this interaction could be potentially exploited for targeted therapeutics in a subset of patients harboring an aggressive form of PDAC."
https://openalex.org/W2466735279,"Background Front-of-pack (FOP) nutrition labels are considered helpful tools to help consumers making healthier food choices, thus improving their diet. In France, the implementation of a FOP nutrition label–the 5-Colour Nutrition Label (5-CNL)–is currently under consideration. Our objective was to investigate dietary profiles in a French adult population using the 5-CNL, and to assess its potential impact in improving the diet through substitution of foods. Methods and Findings Subjects included in the NutriNet-Santé cohort, who had completed three 24-h dietary records were included in this cross-sectional analysis. Mutually exclusive clusters of individuals were identified using the percentage of energy derived from foods of each of the 5-CNL colours as input variables. Three scenarios of substitution of foods for healthier alternative using the 5-CNL were tested. Food group and dietary intakes, socio-demographic and lifestyle data were compared across clusters using ANOVAs or Chi-square tests, as appropriate. We identified three mutually exclusive dietary profiles: ‘Healthy’ (N = 28 095, 29.3% of the sample), with high consumption of fruit, vegetables, whole cereals and fish; ‘Western’ (N = 33 386, 34.8%); with high consumption of sweetened beverages, breakfast cereal, cheese, fatty and sugary foods; ‘Traditional’ (N = 34 461, 35.1%), with high consumption of potatoes, bread, meat and dairy desserts. Overall, substitutions strategies led to an increase in the number of subjects reaching the recommended intakes in energy, macro and micronutrients. Increases were particularly high in the ‘Western’ pattern for lipids and saturates intakes: from 16.2% reaching the recommended amount for lipids (13.5% for saturates) to 60.6% and 85.7% respectively. Conclusion The use of the 5-CNL as an indicator of food choice meaningfully characterizes clusters of dietary habits and appears as an effective tool to help improving the nutritional quality of the diet."
https://openalex.org/W2465757865,"Objectives Assessment of the clinical severity of Fabry disease (FD), an X-linked, rare, progressive disorder based on a genetic defect in alpha-galactosidase is challenging, especially regarding cardiac involvement. The aim of the study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) in discriminating FD patients with cardiac involvement in a large FD patient cohort. Methods cTnI levels were measured with a contemporary sensitive assay in plasma samples taken routinely from FD patients. The assay was calibrated to measure cTnI levels ≥0.01 ng/ml. Elevated cTnI values (cut-off ≥0.04 ng/ml) were correlated with clinical data. Results cTnI was assessed in 62 FD patients (median age: 47 years, males: 36%). Elevated cTnI levels were detected in 23 (37%) patients. Patients with a cTnI elevation were older (median 55 years versus 36 years, p<0.001). Elevated cTnI levels were associated with the presence of a LVH (16/23 versus 1/39; OR 65.81, CI: 6.747–641.859; p<0.001). In almost all patients with a left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) elevated cTnI levels were detected (16/17, 94%). Absolute cTnI levels in patients with LVH were higher than in those without (median 0.23 ng/ml versus 0.02 ng/ml; p<0.001). A cTnI level <0.04ng/ml had a high negative predictive value regarding the presence of a LVH (38/39, 97%). In a control group of non-FD patients (n = 17) with LVH (due to hypertension) none showed cTnI levels ≥0.01 ng/ml. Conclusions Elevated cTnI levels are common in FD patients, reflecting cardiac involvement. FD patients might benefit from a continuous cTnI monitoring."
https://openalex.org/W2467397695,"Objective In developed countries with westernized diets, the excessive consumption of added sugar in beverages and highly refined and processed foods is associated with increased risk for obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. As a major constituent of added sugars, fructose has been shown to cause a variety of adverse metabolic effects, such as impaired insulin sensitivity, hypertriglyceridemia, and oxidative stress. Recent studies have shown that ketohexokinase isoform C is the key enzyme responsible in fructose metabolism that drive’s fructose's adverse effects. The objective of this study was to identify botanical ingredients with potential for inhibitory activity against ketohexokinase-C and fructose-induced metabolic effects by using a series of in vitro model systems. Methods Extracts from 406 botanicals and 1200 purified phytochemicals were screened (initial concentration of 50 μg/mL and 50 μM, respectively) for their inhibitory activity using a cell free, recombinant human ketohexokinase-C assay. Dose response evaluations were conducted on botanical extracts and phytochemicals that inhibited ketohexokinase-C by > 30% and > 40%, respectively. Two different extract lots of the top botanical candidates were further evaluated in lysates of HepG2 cells overexpressing ketohexokinase-C for inhibition of fructose-induced ATP depletion. In addition, extracts were evaluated in intact Hep G2 cells for inhibition of fructose-induced elevation of triglyceride and uric acid production. Results Among the botanical extracts, phloretin (Malus domestica) extracts were the most potent (IC50: 8.9–9.2 μg/mL) followed by extracts of Angelica archangelica (IC50: 22.6 μg/mL—57.3 μg/mL). Among the purified phytochemicals, methoxy-isobavachalcone (Psoralea corylifolia, IC50 = 0.2 μM) exhibited the highest potency against ketohexokinase isoform C activity followed by osthole (Angelica archangelica, IC50 = 0.7 μM), cratoxyarborenone E (Cratoxylum prunifolium, IC50 = 1.0 μM), and α-/γ-mangostin (Cratoxylum prunifolium, IC50 = 1.5 μM). Extracts of Angelica archangelica, Garcinia mangostana, Petroselinum crispum, and Scutellaria baicalensis exhibited ketohexokinase inhibitory activity and blocked fructose-induced ATP depletion and fructose-induced elevation in triglyerides and uric acid. Conclusions Angelica archangelica, Garcinia mangostana, Petroselinum crispum, and Scutellaria baicalensis were the top four botanical candidiates identified with inhibitory activity against ketohexokinase-C. Future studies are needed to show proof of mechanism and the efficacy of these botanical extracts in humans to blunt the negative metabolic effects of fructose-containing added sugars."

We generated a transgenic mouse line with lens-specific expression of a fluorescent reporter driven by the alphaA crystallin promoter. Fetal fibroblasts were isolated from transgenic fetuses, reprogrammed to iPS cells, and differentiated to lentoid bodies exploiting the specific fluorescence of the lens cell-specific reporter.

This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of increasing the influenza VCR of adults with type 2 diabetes in Turkey to 20%.A decision-analytic model was adapted to Turkey using data derived from published sources. Direct medical costs and indirect costs due to productivity loss were included in the societal perspective. The time horizon was set at 1 year to reflect the seasonality of influenza.Increasing the VCR for adults with type 2 diabetes to 20% is predicted to avert an additional 19,777 influenza cases, 2376 hospitalizations, and 236 deaths. Associated influenza costs avoided were estimated at more than 8.3 million Turkish Lira (TRY), while the cost of vaccination would be more than TRY 8.4 million. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was estimated at TRY 64/quality-adjusted life years, which is below the per capita gross domestic product of TRY 21,511 and therefore very cost-effective according to World Health Organization guidelines. Factors most influencing the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio were the excess hospitalization rate, inpatient cost, vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization, and influenza attack rate. Increasing the VCR to >20% was also estimated to be very cost-effective.Increasing the VCR for adults with type 2 diabetes in Turkey to ≥20% would be very cost-effective."

We evaluated the efficacy and safety of FDC versus loose formulation (LF) TB treatment regimens for treatment of pulmonary TB (PTB) in the context of actual medical practice in prevailing conditions within programmatic settings in five sites in two high TB-burden African countries. Methods A two-arm, single-blind, randomized clinical trial comparing FDCs with separate LFs involving 1000 adults newly diagnosed with culture positive PTB was conducted at five sites in two African countries between 2007 and 2011. Participants were randomized to receive daily treatment with anti-TB drugs given as either FDC or separate LFs for 24 weeks (intensive phase– 8 weeks of isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide; continuation phase– 16 weeks of rifampicin and isoniazid). Primary outcome measures were microbiological cure and safety at the end of six months’ treatment; pre-specified non-inferiority margin for difference in cure rate was 4%. The primary efficacy analysis was based on the modified intent to treat (mITT) cohort comprising all randomized patients with a positive baseline culture result for TB and who received at least one dose of study treatment. Patients missing end of treatment culture results were considered failures. Further analyses were done in which mITT patients without an end of treatment (EOT) culture were excluded in a complete case analysis (mITTcc) and a per protocol cohort analysis defined as mITTcc patients who received at least 95% of their intended doses and had an EOT culture result. Results In the mITT analysis, the cure rate in the FDC group was 86.7% (398/459) and in the LF group 85.2% (396/465) (difference 1.5-% (90% confidence interval (CI) (-2.2%– 5.3%)). Per Protocol analysis showed similar results: FDC 98.9% (359/363) versus LF 96.9% (345/356), (difference 2.0% (90% CI: 0.1%– 3.8%)). The two arms showed no significant differences in terms of safety, early culture conversion and patient adherence to treatment. Interpretation The comparison of the two drug regimens satisfied the pre-specified non-inferiority criterion. Our results support the WHO recommendations for the use of FDC in the context of actual medical practice within health services in high TB-endemic countries.

https://openalex.org/W2474925785,"Asexual reproduction, including parthenogenesis in which embryos develop within a female without fertilization, is assumed to confer advantages over sexual reproduction, which includes a “cost of males.” Sexual reproduction largely predominates in animals, however, indicating that this cost is outweighed by the genetic and/or ecological benefits of sexuality, including the acquisition of advantageous mutations occurring in different individuals and the elimination of deleterious mutations. But the evolution of sexual reproduction remains unclear, because we have limited examples that demonstrate the relative success of sexual lineages in the face of competition from asexual lineages in the same environment. Here we investigated a sympatric occurrence of sexual and asexual reproduction in the pineapple mealybug, Dysmicoccus brevipes. This pest invaded southwestern Japan, including Okinawa and Ishigaki Islands, in the 1930s in association with imported pineapple plants. Our recent censuses demonstrated that on Okinawa sexually reproducing individuals can coexist with and even dominate asexual individuals in the presence of habitat and resource competition, which is considered to be severe for this nearly immobile insect. Molecular phylogeny based on partial DNA sequences in the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes, as well as the endosymbiotic bacterial genome, revealed that the asexual lineage diverged from a common sexual ancestor in the relatively recent past. In contrast, only the asexual lineage exhibiting obligate apomictic thelytoky was discovered on Ishigaki. Co-existence of the two lineages cannot be explained by the results of laboratory experiments, which showed that the intrinsic rate of increase in the sexual lineage was not obviously superior to that of the asexual lineage. Differences in biotic and/or abiotic selective forces operating on the two islands might be the cause of this discrepancy. This biological system offers a unique opportunity to assess the relative success of sexual versus asexual lineages with an unusual morphology and life cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2440257421,"Cerebral vasculature is often the target of stroke studies. However, the vasculature supplying the eye might also be affected by ischemia. The aim of the present study was to investigate if the transient global cerebral ischemia (GCI) enhances vascular effect of endothelin-1 (ET-1) and 5-hydroxytryptamine/serotonin (5-HT) on the ophthalmic artery in rats, leading to delayed retinal damage. This was preformed using myography on the ophthalmic artery, coupled with immunohistochemistry and electroretinogram (ERG) to assess the ischemic consequences on the retina. Results showed a significant increase of ET-1 mediated vasoconstriction at 48 hours post ischemia. The retina did not exhibit any morphological changes throughout the study. However, we found an increase of GFAP and vimentin expression at 72 hours and 7 days after ischemia, indicating Müller cell mediated gliosis. ERG revealed significantly decreased function at 72 hours, but recovered almost completely after 7 days. In conclusion, we propose that the increased contractile response via ET-1 receptors in the ophthalmic artery after 48 hours may elicit negative retinal consequences due to a second ischemic period. This may exacerbate retinal damage after ischemia as illustrated by the decreased retinal function and Müller cell activation. The ophthalmic artery and ET-1 mediated vasoconstriction may be a valid and novel therapeutic target after longer periods of ischemic insults."
https://openalex.org/W2470468583,"Background Automated digital microscopy has the potential to improve the diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB), particularly in settings where molecular testing is too expensive to perform routinely. The cost-effectiveness of TB diagnostic algorithms using automated digital microscopy remains uncertain. Methods Using data from a demonstration study of an automated digital microscopy system (TBDx, Applied Visual Systems, Inc.), we performed an economic evaluation of TB diagnosis in South Africa from the health system perspective. The primary outcome was the incremental cost per new TB diagnosis made. We considered costs and effectiveness of different algorithms for automated digital microscopy, including as a stand-alone test and with confirmation of positive results with Xpert MTB/RIF (‘Xpert’, Cepheid, Inc.). Results were compared against both manual microscopy and universal Xpert testing. Results In settings willing to pay $2000 per incremental TB diagnosis, universal Xpert was the preferred strategy. However, where resources were not sufficient to support universal Xpert, and a testing volume of at least 30 specimens per day could be ensured, automated digital microscopy with Xpert confirmation of low-positive results could facilitate the diagnosis of 79–84% of all Xpert-positive TB cases, at 50–60% of the total cost. The cost-effectiveness of this strategy was $1280 per incremental TB diagnosis (95% uncertainty range, UR: $340-$3440) in the base case, but improved under conditions likely reflective of many settings in sub-Saharan Africa: $677 per diagnosis (95% UR: $450-$935) when sensitivity of manual smear microscopy was lowered to 0.5, and $956 per diagnosis (95% UR: $40-$2910) when the prevalence of multidrug-resistant TB was lowered to 1%. Conclusions Although universal Xpert testing is the preferred algorithm for TB diagnosis when resources are sufficient, automated digital microscopy can identify the majority of cases and halve the cost of diagnosis and treatment when resources are more scarce and multidrug-resistant TB is not common."
https://openalex.org/W2470471923,"Habitat selection that has fitness consequences has important implications for conservation activities. For example, habitat characteristics that influence nest success in birds can be manipulated to improve habitat quality with the goal of ultimately improving reproductive success. We examined habitat selection by the threatened streaked horned lark (Eremophila alpestris strigata) at both the breeding-site (territory) and nest-site scales. Larks were selective at both spatial scales but with contrasting selection. At the territory scale, male larks selected sparsely vegetated grasslands with relatively short vegetation. At the nest-site scale, female larks selected sites within territories with higher vegetation density and more perennial forbs. These nest-site scale choices had reproductive consequences, with greater nest success in areas with higher densities of perennial forbs. We experimentally manipulated lark habitat structure in an attempt to mimic the habitat conditions selected by larks by using late summer prescribed fires. After the burn, changes in vegetation structure were in the direction preferred by larks but habitat effects attenuated by the following year. Our results highlight the importance of evaluating habitat selection at spatial scales appropriate to the species of interest, especially when attempting to improve habitat quality for rare and declining species. They also highlight the importance of conducting restoration activities in a research context. For example, because the sparsely vegetated conditions created by fire attenuate, there may be value in examining more frequent burns or hotter fires as the next management and research action. We hope the design outlined in this study will serve as an integrated research and management example for conserving grassland birds generally."
https://openalex.org/W2462173628,"An alternative method for deriving typicality judgments, applicable in young children that are not familiar with numerical values yet, is introduced, allowing researchers to study gradedness at younger ages in concept development. Contrary to the long tradition of using rating-based procedures to derive typicality judgments, we propose a method that is based on typicality ranking rather than rating, in which items are gradually sorted according to their typicality, and that requires a minimum of linguistic knowledge. The validity of the method is investigated and the method is compared to the traditional typicality rating measurement in a large empirical study with eight different semantic concepts. The results show that the typicality ranking task can be used to assess children's category knowledge and to evaluate how this knowledge evolves over time. Contrary to earlier held assumptions in studies on typicality in young children, our results also show that preference is not so much a confounding variable to be avoided, but that both variables are often significantly correlated in older children and even in adults."
https://openalex.org/W2472291757,"Heparanase is an endoglycosidase that participates in morphogenesis, tissue repair, heparan sulphates turnover and immune response processes. It is over-expressed in tumor cells favoring the metastasis as it penetrates the endothelial layer that lines blood vessels and facilitates the metastasis by degradation of heparan sulphate proteoglycans of the extracellular matrix. Heparanase may also affect the hemostatic system in a non-enzymatic manner, up-regulating the expression of tissue factor, which is the initiator of blood coagulation, and dissociating tissue factor pathway inhibitor on the cell surface membrane of endothelial and tumor cells, thus resulting in a procoagulant state. Trying to check the effect of heparanase on heparin, a highly sulphated glycosaminoglycan, when it activates antithrombin, our results demonstrated that heparanase, but not proheparanase, interacted directly with antithrombin in a non-covalent manner. This interaction resulted in the activation of antithrombin, which is the most important endogenous anticoagulant. This activation mainly accelerated FXa inhibition, supporting an allosteric activation effect. Heparanase bound to the heparin binding site of antithrombin as the activation of Pro41Leu, Arg47Cys, Lys114Ala and Lys125Alaantithrombin mutants was impaired when it was compared to wild type antithrombin. Intrinsic fluorescence analysis showed that heparanase induced an activating conformational change in antithrombin similar to that induced by heparin and with a KD of 18.81 pM. In conclusion, under physiological pH and low levels of tissue factor, heparanase may exert a non-enzymatic function interacting and activating the inhibitory function of antithrombin."

There have been occasional reports of substandard generic medicines, especially in resource-limiting settings where policies to control quality may be less rigorous. As HIV treatment in Thailand depends mostly on affordable generic antiretrovirals (ARV), we performed quality assurance testing of several generic ARV available from different sources in Thailand and a source from Vietnam.We sampled Tenofovir 300mg, Efavirenz 600mg and Lopinavir/ritonavir 200/50mg from 10 primary hospitals randomly selected from those participating in the National AIDS Program, 2 non-government organization ARV clinics, and 3 private drug stores. Quality of ARV was analyzed by blinded investigators at the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Science, Chulalongkorn University. The analysis included an identification test for drug molecules, a chemical composition assay to quantitate the active ingredients, a uniformity of mass test and a dissolution test to assess in-vitro drug release. Comparisons were made against the standards described in the WHO international pharmacopeia.A total of 42 batches of ARV from 15 sources were sampled from January-March 2015. Among those generics, 23, 17, 1, and 1 were Thai-made, Indian-made, Vietnamese-made and Chinese-made, respectively. All sampled products, regardless of manufacturers or sources, met the International Pharmacopeia standards for composition assay, mass uniformity and dissolution. Although local regulations restrict ARV supply to hospitals and clinics, samples of ARV could be bought from private drug stores even without formal prescription.Sampled generic ARVs distributed within Thailand and 1 Vietnamese pharmacy showed consistent quality. However some products were illegally supplied without prescription, highlighting the importance of dispensing ARV for treatment or prevention in facilities where continuity along the HIV treatment and care cascade is available."
