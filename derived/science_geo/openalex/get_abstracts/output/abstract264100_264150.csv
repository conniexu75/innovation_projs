https://openalex.org/W2095129637,"This scientific age too readily assumes that whatever knowledge may be incorporated in the artifacts of technology must be derived from science. This assumption is a bit of modern folklore that ignores the many nonscientific decisions, both large and small, made by technologists as they design the world we inhabit. Many objects of daily use have clearly been influenced by science, but their form and function, their dimensions and appearance, were determined by technologists- craftsmen, designers, inventors, and engineers-using nonscientific modes of thought. Carving knives, comfortable chairs, lighting fixtures, and motorcycles are as they are because over the years their designers and makers have established shape, style, and texture. Many features and qualities of the objects that a"

This reduction, which was determined from measurements with the backscattered ultraviolet experiment on the Nimbus 4 satellite, is interpreted as being due to the catalytic destruction of ozone by odd-nitrogen compounds (NOx) produced by the event."
https://openalex.org/W2051855449,An endemic sapotaceous tree Calvaria major found on the island of Mauritius is nearly extinct because its seeds apparently required passage through the digestive tract of the now-extinct dodo Raphus cucullatus to overcome persistent seed coat dormancy caused by a specially thickened endocarp.
https://openalex.org/W1973921234,"Crystals of CdGeO(3) grown at a pressure of 65 kilobars are tetragonal and have an ordered, garnet-like crystal structure with cadmium occupying the dodecahedral and octahedral sites, and germanium the octahedral and tetrahedral sites. The crystal structure (a = 12.406 +/- 1 angstroms, c = 12.256 +/- 1 angstroms, and space group 14,/a) has been refined by least-squares analysis to an R (discrepancy index) of 0.073. Two high-pressure phases of CaGeO(3) were synthesized, one isotypic with tetragonal CdGeO(3) (a = 12.514 +/- 3 angstroms, c = 12.358 +/- 3 angstroms), and the other isotypic with perovskite."
https://openalex.org/W2061908621,"The variability of the carbon-13/carbon-12 ratio in honeys was evaluated preliminary to use of the ratio to detect the addition of high-fructose corn syrup to honey. Eighty-four honey samples representing 34 states and including 37 floral types from 17 plant families were analyzed. The mean value of the per mil increment in carbon-13 (delta13C) for all samples is -25.2 per mil, and the coefficient of variation is 3.7 percent. This is the smallest variation yet encountered for a honey constituent or physical property. The range and magnitude of the values suggest that the floral sources are C(3) plants."
https://openalex.org/W1971052002,"Quantitative data from over 500 concentrates of suspended particulate material has been summarized statistically for the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Caribbean Sea. From clear ocean water a majority of samples were in the range of 0 to 9.9 milligrams per 200 liters and the next largest number were in the range of 10 to 19.9 milligrams per 200 liters. Certain areas of cloudy or nepheloid water, observed photographically, contain relatively more samples in heavier concentration ranges and have larger mean values than clear ocean water."

https://openalex.org/W2078276254,"The pistillate flower of Carica papaya is a pleurogynous unisexual form derived intraspecifically from a perigynous bisexual ancestor. It is a morphological anomaly in that the ovary consists of two cycles of carpels which, in the ancestor, arise on the receptacle at different levels as dissimilar orders of organs. The bulk of the pentamerous ovary and the dorsal carpellary vascular system are derived from a cycle of five stamens in the ancestor. The ventral carpellary system is inherited intact from the ancestor which has normal morphology in the sense that the carpels consist of a single cycle of sporophylls."
https://openalex.org/W1996826653,Analysis of all available observations of faint objects near Saturn during the 1966 passage of the earth through the plane of Saturn's rings suggests the existence of at least one previously undiscovered satellite of Saturn. The data support the previously published orbit for Janus. These satellites may be major members of an extended ring.

Although the volumes of the military wastes are very large, they are on the average almost 100 times more dilute than projected commercial high-level wastes."

https://openalex.org/W2060143001,"Early Investigators As this has been announced to be a centenary year for glacial geology, a few words of explanation may be needed. The relevancy of 1928 as a centenary of glacial geology is based on the fact that two important investigations of glaciers date from the year 1828. That year marks the beginning of glacial studies by Jean de Charpentier, who with Louis Agassiz took high rank in early investigations and who led Agassiz to take up glacial studies. His most important work, “Essai sur les Glaciers,” was not published until 1841, but for several years previous he had presented the results of his investigations before Swiss scientific societies. In 1828 also occurred the first publication by F. J. Hugi, a bold mountaineer, of results of his studies of Alpine glaciers, entitled “Beobachtungen in den Alphen.” 2 His studies brought out many facts about the structure and condition of . . ."
