https://openalex.org/W2145835877,"Proteins that permanently reside in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) must somehow be distinguished from newly synthesized secretory proteins, which pass through this compartment on their way out of the cell. Three luminal ER proteins whose sequence is known, grp78 (""BiP""), grp94, and protein disulphide isomerase, share the carboxy-terminal sequence Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu (KDEL). We show that deletion (or extension) of the carboxyl terminus of grp78 results in secretion of this protein when it is expressed in COS cells. Conversely, a derivative of chicken lysozyme containing the last six amino acids of grp78 fails to be secreted and instead accumulates in the ER. We propose that the KDEL sequence marks proteins that are to be retained in the ER and discuss possible retention mechanisms."

https://openalex.org/W1984979458,"The parasite Plasmodium falciparum, like neoplastic cells, develops resistance to multiple structurally unrelated drugs. If the mechanisms by which P. falciparum and neoplastic cells become resistant are similar, then it may be possible to reverse the resistance in the two types of cells by the same pharmacological agents. Verapamil, a calcium channel blocker, completely reversed chloroquine resistance in two chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum clones from Southeast Asia and Brazil. Verapamil reversed chloroquine resistance at the same concentration (1 X 10(-6)M) as that at which it reversed resistance in multidrug-resistant cultured neoplastic cells. This same concentration of verapamil had no effect on chloroquine-sensitive parasites. Hence, chloroquine resistance in P. falciparum may fit the criteria for the multidrug-resistant phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2026059959,"The gene corresponding to the S. cerevisiae cell division cycle mutant cdc25 has been cloned and sequenced, revealing an open reading frame encoding a protein of 1589 amino acids that contains no significant homologies with other known proteins. Cells lacking CDC25 have low levels of cyclic AMP and decreased levels of Mg2+-dependent adenylate cyclase activity. The lethality resulting from disruption of the CDC25 gene can be suppressed by the presence of the activated RAS2val19 gene, but not by high copy plasmids expressing a normal RAS2 or RAS1 gene. These results suggest that normal RAS is dependent on CDC25 function. Furthermore, mutationally activated alleles of CDC25 are capable of inducing a set of phenotypes similar to those observed in strains containing a genetically activated RAS/adenylate cyclase pathway, suggesting that CDC25 encodes a regulatory protein. We propose that CDC25 regulates adenylate cyclase by regulating the guanine nucleotide bound to RAS proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1641182372,"The binding of Shiga toxin isolated from the bacterium Shigella dysenteriae type 1 to a series of glycolipids and to cells or cell homogenates has been studied. Bound toxin was detected using either 125I-labeled toxin or specific monoclonal antibody and 125I-labeled anti-antibody. Overlay of toxin on thin-layer chromatograms with separated glycolipids and binding to glycolipids coated in microtiter wells established that the toxin specifically bound to Gal alpha 1-4Gal beta (galabiose) placed terminally or internally in the oligosaccharide chain. No glycolipid shown to lack this sequence binds the toxin. Most of the glycolipids with internally placed galabiose were not active, indicating a sterical hindrance for toxin access to the binding epitope. Binding of toxin to HeLa cells in monolayers could be inhibited by preincubation of the toxin with galabiose covalently linked to bovine serum albumin (BSA), but not with free oligosaccharides containing galabiose or with lactose coupled to BSA. This demonstrated that the inhibition is specifically dependent on galabiose and requires multivalency of the disaccharide to be efficient. The inhibitory effect was successively enhanced by increasing the substitution on BSA (7, 18, and 25 mol of galabiose/mol of BSA). The BSA-coupled galabiose could also prevent the cytotoxic effect on HeLa cells (detachment of killed cells). There are cell lines with a dense number of receptor sites, but which are resistant to toxin action (uptake and inhibition of protein synthesis) which may suggest two types of receptor substances which are functionally different and unevenly expressed. In analogy with the mechanism earlier formulated for cholera toxin, we propose glycolipid-bound, bilayer-close galabiose as the functional receptor for membrane penetration of the toxin, while galabiose bound in glycoproteins affords binding sites but is not able to mediate penetration."
https://openalex.org/W2007320153,"The “labeled pathways” hypothesis predicts that axon fascicles in the embryonic neuropil are differentially labeled by surface recognition molecules used for growth cone guidance. To identify candidates for such recognition molecules, we generated monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that recognize surface antigens expressed on subsets of axon fascicles in the grasshopper embryo. The 3B11 and 8C6 MAbs immunoprecipitate 70- and 95-kd membrane glycoproteins called fasciclin I and II, respectively, which are expressed on different subsets of axon fascicles during development. These two glycoproteins are expressed regionally on particular portions of embryonic axons in correlation with their patterns of fasciculation, dynamically during the period of axon outgrowth in a manner consistent with a role in growth cone guidance, and at other times and places during embryogenesis, suggesting multiple developmental roles."

https://openalex.org/W2037738220,"Transcription of the yeast HO gene requires five genes, SWI1, 2, 3, 4, 5. We present evidence that some SWI products activate HO by antagonizing negative regulatory activities encoded by the SIN genes. sin− mutants (defining six genes) were identified because they express HO in the absence of particular SWI products. We argue that SWI5 activates HO by antagonizing SIN3 and that SWI4 activates HO by antagonizing SIN6. HO is expressed in sin3− daughter cells, hence we infer that the SIN3 product represses HO in wild-type daughter cells and that SWI5 and SIN3 are responsible for the cell-lineage-dependent expression of HO. HO is transcribed only when all types of repression are absent: in mother cells, where SWI5 antagonizes SIN3; in late G1, when SWI4 antagonizes SIN6; and in a or α cells, where a1-α2 repression is absent."

https://openalex.org/W1566077296,"This study identifies and partially characterizes an insulin-sensitive glycophospholipid in H35 hepatoma cells. The incorporation of [3H]glucosamine into cell lipids was investigated. A major labeled lipid was purified by sequential thin layer chromatography using first an acid followed by a basic solvent system. After hydrochloric acid hydrolysis and sugar analysis by thin layer chromatography, 80% of the radioactivity in the purified lipid was found to comigrate with glucosamine. H35 cells were prelabeled with [3H]glucosamine for either 4 or 24 h and treated with insulin causing a dose-dependent stimulation of turnover of the glycophospholipid which was detected within 1 min. The purified glycolipid was cleaved by nitrous acid deamination indicating that the glucosamine C-1 was linked to the lipid moiety through a glycosidic bond. [14C]Ethanolamine, [3H]inositol, and [3H]sorbitol were not incorporated into the purified glycolipid. The incorporation of various fatty acids into this glycolipid was also studied. [3H]Palmitate was found to be preferentially incorporated while myristic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, and arachidonic acid were either not incorporated or incorporated less than 10% of palmitate. The purified glycolipid labeled with [3H]palmitate was cleaved by treatment with phospholipase A2 but was resistant to mild alkali hydrolysis suggesting the presence of a 1-hexadecyl,2-palmitoyl-glyceryl moiety in the purified lipid. Treatment of labeled glycophospholipid with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C from Staphylococcus aureus generated a compound migrating as 1-alkyl,2-acyl-glycerol and a polar head group with a size in the range from 800 to 3500. These findings coupled with the nitrous acid deamination demonstrate that glucosamine was covalently linked through a phosphodiester bond to the glyceryl moiety of the purified glycolipid. These findings suggest that insulin acts on this glycophospholipid by stimulating an insulin-sensitive phospholipase C. This unique glycophospholipid may play an important role in insulin action by serving as precursor of insulin-generated mediators."
https://openalex.org/W1598006501,"Phosphoinositide hydrolysis was studied in a washed membrane preparation of 1321N1 astrocytoma cells prelabeled with [3H]inositol. GTP gamma S stimulated the formation of [3H]inositol mono-, bis-, and trisphosphate ([3H]InsP, [3H]InsP2, and [3H]InsP3) with a half-maximal effect on [3H]InsP formation at 5 microM. Carbachol increased the accumulation of [3H]inositol phosphates only in the presence of added guanine nucleotide. Calcium increased [3H]InsP3 accumulation over a range of concentrations (10 nM-3 mM free calcium). When 1321N1 cells were treated with phorbol ester (100 nM 4 beta-phorbol 12 beta-myristate 13 alpha-acetate (PMA)) prior to preparation of the membranes, the maximal [3H]InsP formation induced by GTP gamma S or GTP gamma S plus carbachol was decreased by 50-75%. In contrast, the response to a maximal calcium concentration presumed to activate phospholipase C directly was minimally inhibited (approximately 15%). PMA treatment did not affect muscarinic receptor affinity for carbachol or the effect of GTP on agonist binding. PMA treatment was also without effect on the breakdown of exogenous [3H]InsP3 in homogenates, permeabilized cells, and membranes, indicating that the InsP3-phosphatase was not the site of phorbol ester action. PMA treatment inhibited [3H] InsP3 formation only in membranes and not in cytosol prepared from the same cells, suggesting a membrane site of PMA action. Membranes were also required to demonstrate GTP gamma S-stimulated [3H]InsP3 formation although calcium-stimulated [3H]InsP3 formation was demonstrable in both membranes and cytosol. The addition of purified protein kinase C to the membranes mimicked the effect of PMA treatment to decrease GTP gamma S-stimulated [3H]InsP3 production. These data indicate that the effect of PMA on phosphoinositide metabolism is demonstrable in a cell-free system and that it can be mimicked by protein kinase C. We suggest that the ability of PMA to block GTP gamma S-stimulated formation of [3H]InsP3 results from inhibition of the G protein interaction with phospholipase C."
https://openalex.org/W1494647602,"The hypothalamic neuropeptide gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulates luteinizing hormone secretion via receptor-mediated activation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis to yield inositol phosphates and diacylglycerol. Application of anion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography together with absorbance and radiochemical flow detection has enabled both the characterization and quantitative estimation of pituitary cell inositol phosphates and phosphoinositides. In cultured pituitary cells, GnRH caused a rapid and progressive rise in the formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and of higher polyphosphoinositols corresponding to inositol tetrakisphosphate, pentakisphosphate, and hexakisphosphate. The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate formed during GnRH action was dephosphorylated predominantly via inositol 4-monophosphate rather than the expected metabolite, inositol 1-monophosphate. The catabolism of inositol 4-monophosphate, like that of inositol 1-monophosphate, was inhibited by lithium. For these reasons and because it was the major metabolite of [3H] inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate in permeabilized gonadotrophs, inositol 4-monophosphate appears to represent a specific marker for ligand-stimulated inositol polyphosphate formation and metabolism. The marked and sustained elevations of inositol 4-monophosphate and inositol 1,4-bisphosphate in GnRH-stimulated gonadotrophs indicate that polyphosphoinositides rather than phosphatidylinositol are the preferred substrates of phospholipase C during GnRH action."
https://openalex.org/W1584103877,"We recently described the insulin-dependent release of a carbohydrate substance from plasma membranes which regulated certain intracellular enzymes (Saltiel, A. R., and Cuatrecasas, P. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 83, 5793-5797). This enzyme-modulating substance appeared to arise from the phosphodiesterase hydrolysis of a novel inositol-containing glycolipid. This is supported by observations that insulin stimulated the rapid generation of [3H]myristate-labeled diacylglycerol in cultured BC3Hl myocytes. Myristoyl diacylglycerol production in these cells was unaffected by epinephrine, although arachidonate-labeled diacylglycerol was rapidly produced in response to stimulation by this alpha-1 adrenergic agent. The production of distinct species of diacylglycerol was apparently due to hormonally specific hydrolysis of different precursors. A novel glycolipid was identified on silica TLC or high pressure liquid chromatography which served as a substrate for the insulin-stimulated phosphodiesterase reaction. This glycolipid was metabolically labeled with radioactive inositol, glucosamine, and myristic acid, suggesting a phosphatidylinositol (PI)-glycan structure. Treatment of this glycolipid with a PI-specific phospholipase C resulted in the generation of two products: an inositol phosphate-glycan which modulated the activity of the low Km cAMP phosphodiesterase and myristoyl diacylglycerol. Insulin caused the rapid hydrolysis of the PI-glycan, which was then apparently resynthesized. These data further suggest that insulin stimulates the activity of a phospholipase C which selectively hydrolyzes a novel PI-glycan, releasing a carbohydrate enzyme modulator as well as a unique species of diacylglycerol."
https://openalex.org/W1512035925,"recA protein binding to duplex DNA is a complicated, multistep process. The final product of this process is a stably bound complex of recA protein and extensively unwound double-stranded DNA. recA monomers within the complex hydrolyze ATP with an apparent kcat of approximately 19-22 min-1. Once the final binding state is achieved, binding and ATP hydrolysis by this complex becomes pH independent. The weak binding of recA protein to duplex DNA reported in previous studies does not, therefore, reflect an intrinsically unfavorable binding equilibrium. Instead, this apparent weak binding reflects a slow step in the association pathway. The rate-limiting step in this process involves the initiation rather than the propagation of DNA binding and unwinding. This step exhibits no dependence on recA protein concentration at pH 7.5. Extension or propagation of the recA filament is fast relative to the overall process. Initiation of binding is pH dependent and represents a prominent kinetic barrier at pH 7.5. ATP hydrolysis occurs only after the duplex DNA is unwound. The binding density of recA protein on double-stranded DNA is approximately one monomer/4 base pairs. A model for this process is presented. These results provide an explanation for several paradoxical observations about recA protein-promoted DNA strand exchange. In particular, they demonstrate that there is no thermodynamic requirement for dissociation of recA protein from the heteroduplex DNA product of strand exchange."
https://openalex.org/W171024714,"The receptor-mediated uptake of rat hypercholesterolemic very low density lipoproteins (beta VLDL) and rat chylomicron remnants was studied in monolayer cultures of the J774 and P388D1 macrophage cell lines and in primary cultures of mouse peritoneal macrophages. Uptake of 125I-beta VLDL and 125I-chylomicron remnants was reduced 80-90% in the presence of high concentrations of unlabeled human low density lipoproteins (LDL). Human acetyl-LDL did not significantly compete at any concentration tested. Uptake of 125I-beta VLDL and 125I-chylomicron remnants was also competitively inhibited by specific polyclonal antibodies directed against the estrogen-induced LDL receptor of rat liver. Incubation in the presence of anti-LDL receptor IgG, but not nonimmune IgG, reduced specific uptake greater than 80%. Anti-LDL receptor IgG, 125I-beta VLDL, and 125I-chylomicron remnants bound to two protein components of apparent molecular weights 125,000 and 111,000 on nitrocellulose blots of detergent-solubilized macrophage membranes. Between 70-90% of 125I-lipoprotein binding was confined to the 125,000-Da peptide. Binding of 125I-beta VLDL and 125I-chylomicron remnants to these proteins was competitively inhibited by anti-LDL receptor antibodies. Comparison of anti-LDL receptor IgG immunoblot profiles of detergent-solubilized membranes from mouse macrophages, fibroblasts, and liver, and normal and estrogen-induced rat liver demonstrated that the immunoreactive LDL receptor of mouse cells is of a lower molecular weight than that of rat liver. Incubation of J774 cells with 1.0 micrograms of 25-hydroxycholesterol/ml plus 20 micrograms of cholesterol/ml for 48 h decreased 125I-beta VLDL uptake and immuno- and ligand blotting to the 125,000- and 111,000-Da peptides by only 25%. Taken together, these data demonstrate that uptake of beta VLDL and chylomicron remnants by macrophages is mediated by an LDL receptor that is immunologically related to the LDL receptor of rat liver."
https://openalex.org/W164399989,"The mechanism of matrix vesicle (MV) formation by growth plate chondrocytes in primary cell culture was assessed both by using drugs which interfere with assembly or disassembly of microfilaments and microtubules, as well as by comparison of the composition of chondrocyte microvilli with MV. Cytochalasin D, which is known to inhibit assembly of actin microfilaments, was found to stimulate the release of alkaline phosphatase-rich MV. This stimulatory effect was confirmed by studies with [3H]palmitate- and 32P-prelabeled cells which showed that cytochalasin D enhanced the release of labeled MV. In contrast, phalloidin, which blocks disassembly of microfilaments, suppressed release of cellular alkaline phosphatase into MV. The phospholipid composition of vesicles released by cells treated with cytochalasin D and phalloidin was virtually identical with that of the controls. In contrast, colchicine, which interferes with the assembly of microtubules, was found to cause fragmentation of the cells, producing large vesicles significantly different in lipid composition from MV. Microscopic studies revealed that cytochalasin D caused marked rounding and retraction of the cells, with evidence of actin withdrawal from the cell periphery. This led to cell surface blebbing and formation of small zeiotic bodies at the tips of cell processes. In contrast, phalloidin enhanced and stabilized the actin network within the cells. Chemical analysis of microvilli prepared from isolated chondrocytes revealed high levels of alkaline phosphatase and a phospholipid composition almost identical to MV. Electrophoretic profiles of microvillar proteins were again like that of MV, except for the presence of high levels of actin. This cytoskeletal protein was nondetectable in MV. Taken together with the effects of the drugs, the data indicate that cell surface microvilli are the precursors of MV and that retraction of the supporting microfilament network is essential for the release of these structures."
https://openalex.org/W1490645937,"The effect of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate on the phosphorylation of the ras p21 protein was studied by metabolically labeling cultured cells with [32P]orthophosphate and using a monoclonal antibody to immunoprecipitate the protein. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (100 nM) induced phosphorylation of cKi-ras p21 in a mouse adrenocortical cell line (Yl) expressing high levels of cKi-ras with exon 4B. Phosphorylation was detected at 10 min and was maximal at 2 h. The ras protein was not phosphorylated in response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in NIH 3T3 cells expressing activated cHa-ras or vHa-ras. In vitro, protein kinase C phosphorylated cKi-ras in a phosphatidylserine and diolein-dependent manner. Both in intact cells and in vitro the amino acid phosphorylated was serine. Analysis of p21 from NIH 3T3 cells expressing a variety of ras proteins indicated that phosphorylation occurs within a domain encoded by exon 4B of cKi-ras. Phosphorylation affected neither the binding nor the GTPase activity of the ras protein. We conclude that cKi-ras is a substrate for protein kinase C and that the site of phosphorylation is likely to be serine 181 encoded by exon 4B."

https://openalex.org/W1542808802,"Using 500-MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy we have investigated the branch specificity that bovine colostrum CMP-NeuAc:Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc-R alpha 2----6-sialyltransferase shows in its sialylation of bi-, tri-, and tetraantennary glycopeptides and oligosaccharides of the N-acetyllactosamine type. The enzyme appears to highly prefer the galactose residue at the Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----2Man alpha 1----3 branch for attachment of the 1st mol of sialic acid in all the acceptors tested. The 2nd mol of sialic acid becomes linked mainly to the Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----2Man alpha 1----6 branch in bi- and triantennary substrates, but this reaction invariably proceeds at a much lower rate. Under the conditions employed, the Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----6Man alpha 1----6 branch is extremely resistant to alpha 2----6-sialylation. A higher degree of branching of the acceptors leads to a decrease in the rate of sialylation. In particular, the presence of the Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----6Man alpha 1----6 branch strongly inhibits the rate of transfer of both the 1st and the 2nd mol of sialic acid. In addition, it directs the incorporation of the 2nd mol into tetraantennary structures toward the Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----4Man alpha 1----3 branch. In contrast, the presence of the Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----4Man alpha 1----3 branch has only minor effects on the rates of sialylation and, consequently, on the branch preference of sialic acid attachment. Results obtained with partial structures of tetraantennary acceptors indicate that the Man beta 1----4GlcNAc part of the core is essential for the expression of branch specificity of the sialyltransferase. The sialylation patterns observed in vivo in glycoproteins of different origin are consistent with the in vitro preference of alpha 2----6-sialyltransferase for the Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----2Man alpha 1----3 branch. Our findings suggest that the terminal structures of branched glycans of the N-acetyllactosamine type are the result of the complementary branch specificity of the various glycosyltransferases that are specific for the acceptor sequence Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc-R."
https://openalex.org/W1538897965,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) was shown previously to stimulate the growth of human FS-4 fibroblasts. Here we show that human recombinant TNF can increase the binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF) to these cells. Incubation with TNF resulted in a 40-80% increase in the number of EGF-binding sites with no apparent change in receptor binding affinity. The increase in EGF binding was apparent 8-12 h after the addition of TNF. TNF also increased the amount of EGF receptor protein immunoprecipitated from cells labeled with [35S]methionine. Stimulation of EGF receptor protein synthesis was demonstrable 2-4 h following TNF treatment. TNF increased EGF binding with a dose-response relationship similar to that reported earlier for the mitogenic action. Increased expression of EGF receptors, due to enhanced synthesis of the EGF receptor protein, may be functionally related to the mitogenic action of TNF in human fibroblasts."

https://openalex.org/W2120778672,"We have developed an assay in S. cerevisiae in which clones of cells that contain intact dicentric minichromosomes are visually distinct from those that have rearranged to monocentric minichromosomes. We find that the instability of dicentric minichromosomes is apparently due to mitotic nondisjunction accompanied by occasional structural rearrangements. Monocentric minichromosomes arising by rearrangement of the plasmid are rapidly selected in the population since dicentric minichromosomes depress the rate of cell division. We show that the ability of one centromere to compete with another in dicentric minichromosomes requires the presence of both of the conserved structural elements, CDE II and CDE III. Dicentric minichromosomes can be stabilized if one of the centromeres on the molecule is functionally hypomorphic because of mutations in CDE II even though these mutant centromeres are highly efficient in monocentric molecules. Stable dicentric molecules can also be produced by decreasing the space between two wild-type centromeres on the same molecule. These results suggest plausible pathways for changes in chromosome number that accompany evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1970948283,"We show that a single myogenic progenitor cell in vitro generates two types of myoblasts committed to two distinct myogenic cell lineages. Using fast and slow myosin heavy chain isoform content to define myotube type, we found that myogenic cells from fetal quail (day 10 in ovo) formed two types of myotubes in vitro: fast and mixed fast/slow. Clonal analysis showed that these two types of myotubes were formed from two types of myoblasts committed to distinct fast and fast/slow lineages. Serial subcloning demonstrated that the initial myoblast progeny of an individual myogenic progenitor cell were in the fast lineage, whereas later progeny were in the fast/slow lineage. Fast and slow myosin expression within particular myotubes reflects the genetic processes underlying myoblast commitment to diverse myogenic lineages."

https://openalex.org/W1547173735,"Following DNA strand exchange, recA protein remains associated with the heteroduplex DNA product of the reaction. This association exists without significant changes (as measured by nuclease protection, topological state of the heteroduplex DNA, and rates of ATP hydrolysis) for at least 30 min after strand exchange is complete. The heteroduplex DNA is unwound as a result of this association to an extent at least as great as the unwinding observed when recA protein is bound to duplex DNA at pH 6.35. The extensive unwinding, in combination with the rates of ATP hydrolysis reported elsewhere, provide evidence that recA protein binding is contiguous throughout the heteroduplex DNA. This binding is disrupted upon challenge with heterologous single-stranded DNA, with rapid migration of recA protein to the challenging DNA. These results are discussed in relation to the mechanism of recA protein-promoted branch migration."
https://openalex.org/W2141518405,"The direct interaction between phospholipids and sarcotoxin IA, a potent bactericidal protein of Sarcophaga peregrina, was studied using authentic sarcotoxin IA, its synthetic derivatives, and various liposomes. Results showed that sarcotoxin IA interacted with liposomes constituted from acidic phospholipids, resulting in the release of glucose trapped in these liposomes. The amidated carboxyl-terminal of this protein was found to be important for this interaction. Liposomes constituted from total phospholipids of Escherichia coli became less susceptible to sarcotoxin IA with an increase in their cholesterol content. Since bacterial membranes do not contain cholesterol, this finding may partly explain the selective toxicity of sarcotoxin I to bacteria."

Oligonucleotide-directed deletion was used to show that only the second domain has an essential function in membrane assembly.

https://openalex.org/W1514770164,"Metabolism of 32-hydroxy-24,25-dihydrolanosterol (lanost-8-ene-3 beta,32-diol), a posturated intermediate of the 14 alpha-demethylation (removal of C-32) of 24,25-dihydrolanosterol (lanost-8-en-3 beta-ol), by a reconstituted system consisting of yeast cytochrome P-450 which catalyzes lanosterol 14 alpha-demethylation (cytochrome P-45014DM) (Yoshida, Y., and Aoyama, Y. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 1655-1660 and Aoyama, Y., Yoshida, Y., and Sato, R. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 1661-1666) and NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase was studied. The reconstituted system converted both 32-hydroxy-24,25-dihydrolanosterol and 24,25-dihydrolanosterol to 4,4-dimethyl-5 alpha-cholesta-8,14-dien-3 beta-ol, the 14 alpha-demethylated product of the latter. The metabolism of these compounds was inhibited by a low concentration of ketoconazole which is a potent cytochrome P-45014DM inhibitor. Affinity of cytochrome P-45014DM for 32-hydroxy-24,25-dihydrolanosterol was about 20 times higher than for 24,25-dihydrolanosterol and the cytochrome metabolized the former about 4 times faster than the latter under the experimental conditions. Spectral analysis suggested that the 32-hydroxyl group of 32-hydroxy-24,25-dihydrolanosterol interacted with the heme iron of the oxidized cytochrome and this interaction might support the high affinity of this compound for the cytochrome. These lines of evidence indicate that 32-hydroxy-24,25-dihydrolanosterol is the intermediate of the 14 alpha-demethylation of 24,25-dihydrolanosterol by cytochrome P-45014DM. It is also clear that the cytochrome catalyzes further metabolism of the 32-hydroxylated intermediate to the 14 alpha-demethylated product with higher efficiency than the 32-hydroxylation of the substrate. Cytochrome P-45014DM is thus classified as lanosterol C14-C32 lyase."
https://openalex.org/W1602431108,"Prorenin is an inactive form of the aspartic protease renin. Like pepsinogen, it is activated at low pH. The kinetics of acid activation of prorenin were studied in human amniotic fluid and plasma and in preparations of purified prorenin isolated from amniotic fluid and plasma. Conversion of prorenin (pR) into active renin (R) appeared to be a two-step process involving the generation of an intermediary form of activated prorenin (pRa). The pR—pRa step is an acid-induced reversible change in the conformation of the molecule, and the pRa—R step is proteolytic. pRa—R conversion occurred in amniotic fluid at low pH by the action of an endogenous aspartic protease. In plasma pRa—R conversion occurs after restoration of pH to neutral and is caused by the serine protease plasma kallikrein. pRa—R conversion did not occur in purified preparations of prorenin. Thus, in contrast to pepsinogen, the acid-induced reversible conformational change is not followed by autocatalysis. pRa of amniotic fluid and plasma could be separated from R by affinity chromatography on Cibacron blue F3GA-agarose, and R but not pRa was detected by an immunoassay using monoclonal antibodies reacting with R and not with pR. The first-order rate constant for pR—pRa conversion depends on the protonation of a polar group (or groups) with pK approximately 3.4, the rate constant being proportional to the fraction of pR molecules that have this group protonated. This is analogous to the reversible acid-induced conformational change of pepsinogen that occurs before its proteolytic conversion into pepsin. kcat/Km for pRa—R conversion by plasmin and plasma kallikrein at pH 7.4 and 37 degrees C was 7.8 × 10(6) and 5.2 × 10(6) M-1 min-1, respectively, which was about 50-70 times greater than for pR—R conversion. The susceptibility of pRa to proteolytic attack is high enough for the intrinsic factor XII-kallikrein pathway to cause rapid pRa—R conversion at 37 degrees C even in whole blood with its abundance of serine protease inhibitors.

This system consists of two proteins encoded in plasmid genes REP1 and REP2 and a cis-active noncoding locus, designated REP3. We have raised antibodies against a REP1 beta-galactosidase fusion protein and used them to identify the authentic REP1 protein in plasmid-bearing yeast cells. We find that REP1 protein is located exclusively in the nucleus and co-purifies with a karyoskeletal protein subfraction operationally and morphologically equivalent to the nuclear matrix-pore complex-lamina fraction of higher cells. The carboxyl half of the REP1 protein exhibits strong sequence homology to myosin heavy chain, vimentin, and nuclear lamins A and C, indicating a fibrous structure for the protein. From these observations, we suggest that REP1 protein may promote plasmid partitioning by intercalating into the nuclear lamina of the host cell to provide dispersed anchorage sites for attachment of plasmid molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1608390185,"We have isolated two unlinked yeast genes complementing the cell division cycle mutant cdc25-1, one containing the wild type allele CDC25 and the other acting as an extragenic suppressor of the cdc25-1 lesion if present on a multicopy plasmid. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the suppressor gene has revealed an open reading frame that encodes a 45,000-dalton protein belonging to the protein kinase family. The cdc25-suppressing protein kinase (PK-25) shows 48% sequence similarity to the catalytic subunit (CA) of mammalian cAMP-dependent protein kinase and 27-31% similarity to cyclic nucleotide-independent enzymes, including the yeast CDC28 gene product. The PK-25 gene was targeted by integrative transformation into a chromosomal region unlinked to the CYR2 site, the structural gene of CA. The cdc25-suppressing protein kinase is also functionally different from CA, since cyr2 strains deficient in the free catalytic subunit remain temperature sensitive if transformed with a multicopy plasmid containing the PK-25 gene. Furthermore, a deficiency of the cAMP-binding regulatory subunit (RA) caused by the bcy1 mutation fails to suppress the cdc25 mutation, indicating that PK-25 does not interact with the cAMP receptor protein. Our data suggest that the cdc25 suppressor gene encodes a cAMP-independent protein kinase involved in the control of the cell cycle start."
https://openalex.org/W1541743572,"Renin was completely purified from human kidney cortex employing a rapid three-step procedure which included homogenization and ammonium sulfate precipitation, aminohexyl-pepstatin affinity chromatography, and affinity chromatography using a synthetic octapeptide renin inhibitor (H-77) with a reduced peptide bond (-CH2-NH- instead of -CO-NH-) between Leu5-Leu6, Three kg of cortex dissected from 10 kg of human cadaver kidney yielded 1.7 +/- 0.5 mg of protein (mean +/- S.E. for five procedures) with a specific activity of 1094 +/- 166 Goldblatt units/mg of protein and an overall recovery of 52 +/- 2%. Both gel filtration high performance liquid chromatography and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) revealed a molecular weight of 44,000, although Mr = 22,000 and 18,000 bands were also identified by SDS-PAGE. The pH optima with sheep angiotensinogen were 5.5 and 7.8 and the Km was 0.31 microM. With pure human substrate the pH optimum was 6.0 and the Km was 1.15 microM. Enzyme activity was inhibited by two different anti-human renal renin antibodies. Amino-terminal sequencing demonstrated a leucine residue at the 1-position. Sequencing of 15 additional amino acids agreed with that predicted from the gene sequence and indicated that prorenin is converted to renin following cleavage at the carboxyl end of two basic residues, Lys-2 Arg-1. As with SDS-PAGE analysis, high performance liquid chromatography in the presence of 6 M urea demonstrated Mr = 44,000, 22,000, and 18,000 bands. Immunoblot studies revealed that all of these bands cross-reacted with antihuman renin antibody. Amino-terminal sequencing indicated the Mm = 22,000 band is the amino terminus and the Mr = 18,000 band the carboxyl terminus of Mr = 44,000 renin. In the aqueous phase, these subunits bound to H-77 suggesting that they represent components of the active enzyme complex. Unlike mouse renin, there was no evidence of disulfide bonds. These results raise the question of whether human renin circulates as a subunit aggregation as well as a single chain protein. This may serve as a possible mechanism to regulate renin activity in plasma and tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1595183559,"A full-length human phenylalanine hydroxylase cDNA has been recombined with a prokaryotic expression vector and introduced into Escherichia coli. Transformed bacteria express phenylalanine hydroxylase immunoreactive protein and pterin-dependent conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine. Recombinant human phenylalanine hydroxylase produced in E. coli has been partially purified, and biochemical studies have been performed comparing the activity and kinetics of the recombinant enzyme with native phenylalanine hydroxylase from human liver. The optimal reaction conditions, kinetic constants, and sensitivity to inhibition by aromatic amino acids are the same for recombinant phenylalanine hydroxylase and native phenylalanine hydroxylase. These data indicate that the recombinant human phenylalanine hydroxylase is an authentic and complete phenylalanine hydroxylase enzyme and that the characteristic aspects of phenylalanine hydroxylase enzymatic activity are determined by a single gene product and can be constituted in the absence of any specific accessory functions of the eukaryotic cell. The availability of recombinant human phenylalanine hydroxylase produced in E. coli will expedite physical and chemical characterization of human phenylalanine hydroxylase which has been hindered in the past by inavailability of the native enzyme for study."
https://openalex.org/W1571712687,"Oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis was used to systematically shorten the hydrophobic region within the signal peptide of the Escherichia coli outer membrane protein OmpA. DNA encoding the wild type and mutant OmpA signal peptides were then fused in frame to DNA encoding the mature regions of Staphylococcus aureus nuclease A and TEM beta-lactamase. The ability of these signal peptides to direct processing of the resulting hybrid proteins was dependent on both their length and the protein to which they were fused. Deletion of two or more residues progressively slowed processing of pro-OmpA-nuclease. By contrast, pro-OmpA-beta-lactamase was less sensitive to the length of the hydrophobic region than to the nature of the deleted residue(s). Deletion of an Ala residue tended to reduce processing efficiency of pro-OmpA-beta-lactamase, while deletion of an Ile residue, together with the Ala residue, resulted in improvement. The loss of either 3 or 4 residues abolished processing of both hybrids. These data indicate that both the length as well as the identity of residues in the hydrophobic region are important. The relative importance of these two factors depends on the mature region of the protein being secreted."
https://openalex.org/W1604032569,"An RNA polymerase holoenzyme containing sigma 32, the heat-shock sigma subunit, has been purified from heat-shocked Escherichia coli cells, and its functional properties including the promoter selectivity have been analyzed using the in vitro mixed transcription system. The holoenzyme correctly recognized a heat-shock promoter for the groE gene and efficiently initiated transcription at the same site as that found in vivo. The enzyme was, however, unable to recognize the promoters which are usually transcribed by the regular holoenzyme (E sigma 70), such as tufB, nusA, supP, lacUV5, araS, rpsA, recA, rplJ, dnaQ, rnh, and trp promoters. On the other hand, the regular holoenzyme did not recognize the groE promoter. These observations altogether indicate that strict difference exists in the promoter selectivity between two molecular species of the RNA polymerase holoenzyme. The groE transcription in vitro was not affected significantly within the temperature range from 32 to 42 degrees C. The two sigma subunits could be replaced in vitro on the same core enzyme, supporting the view that the spectrum of gene expression in E. coli is under a dynamic control by intracellular levels of individual sigma subunits."
https://openalex.org/W91855966,"A synthetic peptide corresponding to the signal sequence of wild type Escherichia coli lambda-receptor protein (LamB) inhibits in vitro translocation of precursors of both alkaline phosphatase and outer membrane protein A into E. coli membrane vesicles (half-maximal inhibition at 1-2 microM). By contrast, the inhibitory effect was nearly absent in a synthetic peptide corresponding to the signal sequence from a mutant strain that harbors a deletion mutation in the LamB signal region and displays an export-defective phenotype for this protein in vivo. Two peptides derived from pseudorevertant strains that arose from the deletion mutant and exported LamB in vivo were found to inhibit in vitro translocation with effectiveness that correlated with their in vivo export ability. Controls indicated that these synthetic signal peptides did not disrupt the E. coli membrane vesicles. These results can be interpreted to indicate that the presequences of exported proteins interact specifically with a receptor either in the E. coli inner membrane or in the cytoplasmic fraction. However, biophysical data for the family of signal peptides studied here reveal that they will spontaneously insert into a lipid membrane at concentrations comparable to those that cause inhibition. Hence, an indirect effect mediated by the lipid bilayer of the membrane must be considered."
https://openalex.org/W1646976215,"Abstract A radioactive, photoactive Vinca alkaloid, N-(p-azido-[3,5-3H]-benzoyl)-N'-beta-aminoethylvindesine [( 3H]NABV) with pharmacological and biological activities similar to vinblastine was synthesized and used to identify specific Vinca alkaloid macromolecular interactions in calf brain homogenate by photoaffinity labeling. The most prominent photolabeled species were 54.3- and 21.5-kDa polypeptides. The Vinca alkaloid-binding specificity of these polypeptides was confirmed by competitive blocking of specific photolabeling by vinblastine but not by colchicine or daunorubicin. The 54.3- and 21.5-kDa polypeptides exhibited specific half-maximum saturable photolabeling at 2.1 and 0.95 X 10(-7) M [3H]NABV, respectively. Relative vinblastine and NABV association constants (Ka vinblastine/Ka NABV) for the 54.3- and 21.5-kDa polypeptides were estimated to be 0.86 and 1.4, respectively. The 54.3-kDa component was found in both high speed (100,000 X g; 1 h) pellet and supernatant fractions, whereas the 21.5-kDa component was located primarily in the high speed pellet. Photolabeling of both components was maximal after 12-min UV light exposure, linear up to 120 micrograms of homogenate protein and only slightly affected by the nitrene scavenger p-aminobenzoic acid. The 54.3-kDa polypeptides of [3H]NABV-photolabeled calf brain high speed supernatant and detergent-solubilized high speed pellet fractions were identified as tubulin subunits by immunoprecipitation with monoclonal antibodies to alpha- or beta-tubulin subunits. Although the identity and function of the 21.5-kDa polypeptide is not known, this polypeptide may have a role in membrane-related effects of the Vinca alkaloids. These results demonstrate that [3H]NABV is an attractive tool for identifying and characterizing specific high affinity vinblastine cellular polypeptide acceptors which may initiate or mediate known and unknown mechanisms of Vinca alkaloid action."
https://openalex.org/W1605966225,"The complexes formed between Escherichia coli single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSBP) and the heavy atom-modified single-stranded polynucleotides poly(5-BrU) and poly(5-HgU) are investigated using optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) methods. In these complexes the triplet state properties of the tryptophan residues are subjected to the external heavy atom effect generated by bromine and mercury atoms and are characterized by a shortened triplet state lifetime and the appearance of the otherwise dark [D] + [E] slow passage ODMR signal. These features provide direct evidence for close range interactions between tryptophan residue(s) and the nucleotide bases in the complexes. The extent of the triplet state lifetime reduction in the case of the SSBP-poly(5-HgU) complex together with steric considerations of the complex structure is consistent only with a van der Waals contact between the perturbed molecule and the heavy atom perturber by means of a stacking interaction. Fast passage ODMR measurements show a lifetime for a sublevel of the perturbed tryptophan chromophore(s) in this complex on the order of 1 ms. The amplitude-modulated phosphorescence microwave double resonance technique captures selectively the broadened and red-shifted phosphorescence spectrum of the heavy atom-perturbed tryptophan residue(s). This work supports a model for the binding of SSBP to single-stranded polynucleotides in which the bases are inserted into hydrophobic regions of the protein, where they are likely to undergo stacking interactions with the indole moiety of buried tryptophan residues."
https://openalex.org/W1606764002,"We have carried out photoaffinity labeling of the ras p21 protein, a ras oncogene product, with [alpha-32P]GTP. Based on our studies, a sensitive, rapid, and specific assay for the detection of multiple forms of ras p21 has been developed. The specificity of this protocol is shown by (a) sensitivity of affinity labeling of ras p21 to known inhibitors of GTP binding and (b) immunoprecipitation of affinity labeled protein with anti-ras p21 serum. Detection and semiquantitation of ras p21 by this method is accomplished in less than 24 h and requires as little as 100,000 cells or about 5 mg of tissue sample from skin tumor, liver, and mammary tumor tissues. Furthermore, using this approach, we were able to detect the selective loss of one species of ras p21 in transplanted Morris hepatoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W1564334329,"Degradation of serum amyloid A (SAA) was studied in the isolated perfused rat liver. Radioiodinated SAA was reconstituted with high density lipoproteins (HDL) and administered to rats. Plasma was taken 1 h later, and the HDL were isolated for use as tracer. HDL-bound 125I-SAA was cleared from the plasma of intact animals at a rate similar to SAA in native human HDL. Catabolism of SAA and HDL apoproteins was studied in parallel in the perfused liver. In a 3-h perfusion, 21% of SAA was degraded in contrast to 13% of apoC-III, 7% of apoA-I, and 6% of apoA-II. SAA1 (47% in 3 h) was degraded more rapidly than SAA5 (37%) although their in vivo clearance rates were similar. Degradation of SAA was inhibited when lipoproteins were added to the perfusate. At a protein concentration of 0.15 mg/ml, low density lipoproteins inhibited 47%, HDL 62%, and SAA-rich HDL 75%. Lipid-free normal HDL (0.3 mg/ml perfusate) did not appreciably affect SAA degradation; however, delipidated SAA-rich HDL (0.3 mg of protein/ml; 0.02 mg of SAA/ml) inhibited SAA degradation by 40%. Isolated perfused mouse liver proved more effective than rat liver in degrading SAA (5.3% versus 2.8%/g of liver/h). Degradation appeared to be mediated by cell-associated enzymes since perfusate, which had been recirculated through the liver for 3 h, accounted for less than 15% of the total degradation. Partial (38%) hepatectomy did not significantly reduce apoA-I clearance but reduced that of SAA by 16%, providing additional evidence for hepatic SAA catabolism. We conclude from these studies that SAA is catabolized independently of other HDL proteins, that association with lipoproteins retards SAA clearance, and that SAA catabolism is, in part, a specific process."
https://openalex.org/W2416858685,"Various lengths of oligoribonucleotides corresponding to regions flanking the initiation site of the A1 promoter of the T7 delta D111 template were examined in order to determine their ability to function as primers of transcription for the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase from Escherichia coli. The oligoribonucleotides which functioned as primers were also examined as precursors for the formation of a stable ternary complex (enzyme X DNA template X oligoribonucleotide product) by systematically extending each primer with one or more specific cognate substrate nucleotide triphosphates. A stable ternary complex (resistant to a salt jump challenge) was formed whenever the primer oligoribonucleotide and augmenting nucleotide triphosphate(s) allowed the formation of the normal third phosphodiester bond of the transcript to occur on the enzyme surface. An oligoribonucleotide (a cognate having the correct base-pairing substituents) containing the preformed third phosphodiester bond does not function as a primer. For example the cognate oligoribonucleotide corresponding to the region flanking the A1 promoter of the T7 delta D111 is: formula; see text The limit primer is the oligoribonucleotide trimer AUC (+1...+3). Other acceptable primers are constructed by adding to this limit primer, cognate bases in the negative registry. The oligonucleotide containing one base added to this limit primer in the positive registry (e.g. AUCG) is completely inactive as a primer. We have also demonstrated these phenomena for the A2 and the A3 promoter of the T7 template."
https://openalex.org/W1538642905,"Purified DNA polymerase III holoenzyme (holoenzyme) was separated by glycerol gradient sedimentation into the beta subunit and the subassembly that lacks it (pol III). In the presence of ATP, beta subunit dimer dissociated from holoenzyme with a KD of 1 nM; in the absence of ATP, the KD was greater than 5 nM. The beta subunit was known to remain tightly associated in the holoenzyme upon formation of an initiation complex with a primed template and during the course of replication. With separation from the template, holoenzyme dissociated into beta and pol III. Cycling to a new template depended on the reformation of holoenzyme. Holoenzyme was in equilibrium with pol III and the beta subunit in crude enzyme fractions as well as in pure preparations."
https://openalex.org/W1486742670,"In the presence of ATP, the beta subunit of the Escherichia coli DNA polymerase III holoenzyme can induce a stable initiation complex with the other holoenzyme subunits and primed DNA that is capable of highly processive synthesis. We have recently demonstrated that the ATP requirement for processive synthesis can be bypassed by an excess of the beta subunit (Crute, J., LaDuca, R., Johanson, K., McHenry, C., and Bambara, R. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 11344-11349). To examine the complex formed with excess beta subunit, and the lengths of the products of processive synthesis, we have designed a uniquely primed DNA template. Poly(dA)4000 was tailed with dCTP by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase and the resulting template annealed to oligo(dG)12-18. In the presence of excess beta, the lengths of processively extended primers nearly equaled the full-length of the DNA template. Similar length synthesis occurred in the presence or absence of spermidine or single-stranded DNA-binding protein. When the beta subunit was present at normal holoenzyme stoichiometry it could induce highly processive synthesis without ATP, although inefficiently. Both ATP and excess beta increased the amount of initiation complex formation, but complexes produced with excess beta did so without the time delay observed with ATP, suggesting different mechanisms for formation. Almost 50% of initiation complexes formed without ATP survived a 30-min incubation with anti-beta IgG, reflecting a stability similar to those formed with ATP. The ability to form initiation complexes in the absence of ATP permitted the demonstration that cycling of the holoenzyme to a new primer, after chain termination with a dideoxynucleotide, is not affected by the presence of ATP."
https://openalex.org/W1560195179,A high-affinity calcium-dependent calmodulin-binding protein (CaMBP) has been isolated from Electrophorus electricus main electric organ. This 55-kDa CaMBP has been purified to homogeneity by ion exchange and calmodulin-Sepharose affinity chromatography and electrophoretic elution from preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. Antibodies against the 55-kDa CaMBP were raised in sheep and were affinity purified. A 47-kDa high-affinity CaMBP species was demonstrated by limited protease digestion and immunoblot analysis to be derived from the 55-kDa CaMBP. The 55-kDa CaMBP has also been isolated from skeletal muscle. It is not detectable by immunoblot analysis in nonexcitable tissues. Characterization of the 55-kDa high-affinity calmodulin-acceptor protein may further elucidate the role of calcium-calmodulin in the regulation of bioelectricity.
https://openalex.org/W1487815161,"An 19F NMR probe has been attached to the reactive sulfhydryl SH1 of the globular heads of rabbit skeletal heavy meromyosin. It serves as a sensitive monitor of the conformational state of the heads of heavy meromyosin in a manner similar to that seen for subfragment-1 (Shriver, J.W., and Sykes, B.D. (1982) Biochemistry 21, 3022-3028; Tollemar, U., Cunningham, K., and Shriver, J.W. (1986) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 873, 243-251). The NMR spectra indicate that there are at least two states for the heads in the SH1 region. The energetics of the interconversion of the two states of heavy meromyosin (HMM) differs significantly from that of S-1. In HMM in the absence of divalent cations, there are two reversible paths between the low temperature and high temperature states with a hysteresis-like behavior. One path is consistent with the head groups behaving independently and similar to S-1 alone. The second path indicates a coupling of the globular head region observed in S-1 with a second region forming a distinctly different cooperative unit. Upon addition of Ca(II) the hysteresis effect is lost and only the second cooperative unit is observed. Two explanations are offered for these results: the globular heads in HMM may couple with the S-2 segment, or the two globular heads of HMM may couple to form a larger cooperative unit. The ability to stabilize the larger cooperative unit with a divalent metal ion implicates a role for the LC2 light chain in coupling regions of the myosin molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1521761805,Abstract A hydrodynamic study of protein S4 from Escherichia coli 30 S ribosomal subunits indicates that this protein is moderately asymmetric. A sedimentation coefficient of 1.69 S and a diffusion coefficient of 7.58 X 10(-7) cm2/s suggest that S4 has an axial ratio of about 5:1 using a prolate ellipsoidal model. This structure should give a radius of gyration of about 29-30 A from small-angle neutron or small-angle x-ray scattering studies. This study has utilized quasi-elastic light scattering as an analytical tool to obtain a diffusion coefficient as well as a method to monitor sample quality. Using quasi-elastic light scattering in this manner allows an assessment of problems associated with protein purity which may be responsible for the many disparate results reported for ribosomal proteins and especially protein S4.
