https://openalex.org/W2085619452,"The immune responses of inbred mice to a related series of three synthetic polypeptide antigens are genetically controlled traits which are closely correlated with the genotype for the major histocompatibility (H-2) locus. All strains of the same H-2 type exhibit the same pattern of immune response, independent of the remainder of a given strain's genetic background. There is marked antigen-specific polymorphism between strains of different H-2 types with respect to their patterns of response."
https://openalex.org/W2008998085,"Electron microscopy of heteroduplex DNA molecules, composed of one strand of Escherichia coli phage lambda(+) DNA annealed to the complementary DNA strand of a lambda deletion or substitution mutant, permits visualization, as well as precise measurements and mapping, of the unpaired single-stranded regions of nonhomology in the otherwise double-stranded molecules. In the lambdab2 mutant, the central segment (13 percent) of the lambda(+) DNA molecule is shown to be deleted. In the hybrid phages lambda(i434) and lambda(i21) a segment of the right arm of the lambda(+) genome (5.5 or 7.6 to 9 percent) is replaced by the corresponding immunity regions of phage 434 (3.3 percent or phage 21 (4 percent) DNA. The b5 region in the lambdab5 mutant appears to be identical to the i(21) segment. From these data it is possible to estimate the size and posiion of those lambda genes which are replaced by the i(434) and i(21) segments. The method permits preparing complete physical maps of viral genomes with a precision heretofore unattainable."
https://openalex.org/W2063926661,"Frozen protein and nucleic acid solutions at -35°C show relatively narrow (100 milligauss) proton nuclear magnetic resonance signals which are assignable to water that is sufficiently mobile to reduce the dipolar broadening normally associated with solids. Hydration was found to be 0.3 to 0.5 gram of water per gram of protein. Nucleic acids are three to five times as hydrated as proteins. Conformational changes in solution produce detectable changes in line-width or amount of ""bound"" water, or both. The very fact that the water signals can be observed by high resolution nuclear magnetic resonance suggests that it is not ""ice-like"" in any literal sense, although it is clearly less mobile than liquid water at the same temperature. A simple model is described which considers both surface hydration and trapped water."

https://openalex.org/W2016071773,"The nitrate concentration (weighted average) in stream water from an experimentally deforested watershed increased from 0.9 milligram per liter before removal of the vegetation to 53 milligrams per liter 2 years later. This nitrate mobilization, presumably due to increased microbial nitrification, was equivalent to all of the other net cationic increases and anionic decreases observed in tae drainage water."

https://openalex.org/W1991337980,A thin-layer chromatographic analysis of Drosophila melanogaster revealed a lipid to be found almost exclusively in the adult male. The compound or class of compounds having an RF close to that of methyl oleate is present in substantial amounts and is located predominantly in the ejaculatory bulb. It appears from genetic studies that the formulation of the lipid is not mediated by the Y chromosome.

https://openalex.org/W1967024534,"When a major portion of the intracellular K+ in frog muscle is reversibly replaced by Na+, the extra Na+ gained by the cells does not show the nuclear magnetic resonance signal that free Na+ does. The data contradict the membrane theory but are in accord with the concept that the bulk of intracellular K+ is adsorbed."
https://openalex.org/W2087495059,"The density of the cytoplasmic DNA of two strains of ""petite"" mutants of yeast, obtained by treatment with acriflavin and with ultraviolet light, was examined in cesium chloride density-gradient centrifugation and in all cases appeared to be less than that of the wild type. A cytoplasmic respiratory-deficient strain, treated with additional acriflavin, can show a further shift of the position of the satellite band, always in the direction of reduction of density. Also, from the p(+) x p(-) cross, p(-) strains can be recovered in which the density of the satellite DNA is different from the density of the parent p(-) strain. This finding suggests the existence of recombination in cytoplasmic DNA moleciules."

https://openalex.org/W2076212535,HeLa cell microsomes incorporate labeled amino acids in vitro into acid-soluble proteins which have the same electrophoretic mobility as histones isolated from tile purified HeLa cell nuclei. The capacity to Svnthesize histones in vitro is dependent on deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis in the cells from which the microsonal fraction is prepared.
https://openalex.org/W2142311440,"Two short-term cyclic events, buccal oscillations and ventilatory cycles, occur in the bullfrog's respiration. Dutring ventilation the frog fills the buccal cavity with air, then blows the pulmonary contents through the buccal cavity, and finally closes the nostrils while pumnping the buccal contents into the lungs. The pulmonary efflux streams by the buccal contents with minimal mixing, and relatively pure air is pumped into the lungs. Buccal oscillations serve mainly to flush out the buccal cavity between ventilatory cycles."

https://openalex.org/W2004261413,"Selective destruction of small lymphocytes in the thymusdependent areas of lymph nodes and thymocytes was observed in mice infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. These changes were clearly evident in lymphoid and splenic tissue 3 days after infection and in the thymus by day 7. The destructive changes paralleled growth of the virus in these organs. The findings show that infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus can temporarily cause the equivalent effect of neonatal thymectomy, that is, a ""viral thymectomy,"" which appears to be related to the ability of this virus to cause persistent infection."
https://openalex.org/W1978610097,"Two new products were isolated from uracil irradiated with ultraviolet light in frozen aqueous solution. As judged by mass, nuclear magnetic resonance, and ultraviolet and infrared spectra, one is a photopolymer, U(3) and the structure of the other is probably 6-4'-[ pyrimidin-2'-one]-uracil. Formations of these products between pyrimidine bases are apparently common photoreactions, and may be important to the study of the photochemistry and photobiology of nucleic acids."
https://openalex.org/W1989264163,"PROLONGED observation of labelled macrophages within inflammatory reactions in the ear chambers of rabbits has led to the suggestion that some of these cells may be very long lived1,2. Objective evidence in favour of the existence of long lived macrophages has, however, been lacking. In addition, study of granulomata induced by complete Freund adjuvant indicates a high rate of turnover of participating macrophages, with no evidence of persistence beyond 1–2 weeks of the mononuclear cells that originally emigrated into the lesion from the circulation3. We have found a similar high rate of turnover among the macrophages in chronic inflammatory reactions provoked by B. pertussis vaccine or paraffin oil."
https://openalex.org/W2080438313,Ozone injury to Bel W3 tobacco and pinto bean plants increases with increasing humidity. The degree of plant injury sustained correlates well with porometer measurements; this indicates that the size of stomatal apertures increases with increasing humidity. Humidity may therefore influence plant response to all pollutants and may account in part for the greater sensitivity of plants to ozone-type injury in the eastern United States compared with the same species of plants grown in the Southwest. with those grown in the Southwest.

https://openalex.org/W2054790372,"Spore heat resistance is largely an inducible property, chemically reversible between a sensitive and resistant state. Therefore, the constitutive assumption and common practices based on it, such as direct testing of spores for heat resistance without prior treatment and the assumption of logarithmic death for spores in general, are no longer appropriate. A new approach is reported to the reduction of heating severity for a given survivor reduction of bacterial spores suspended in complex biological mixtures at their ordinary pH. Heating time advantages amount to severalfold and do not involve antimicrobial additives."

https://openalex.org/W2024869412,"Paramyosin paracrystals formed with divalent cations have a 725-angstrom axial period and show simple negative staining patterns in the electron microscope. The structure of the aggregates is interpreted in terms of an array of polar molecules about 1275 angstroms long, with ""gaps"" and ""overlaps"" in the molecular assembly. Antiparallel relations between molecules lead to the assembly of paracrystals with opposite polarity at either end. Implications of the in vitro structures for filaments containing paramyosin in muscle are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2041230949,"Airborne sound and substrate vibration each elicit electrical responses below the surface of the tectum in species of three families of snakes. Tones of 50 to 1000 hertz evoke responses independently of substrate vibration. Sensitivity to locally applied sound is present over much of the body surface. This sensitivity is attributed to the auditory nerve, because it is not altered by spinal section but is eliminated by destruction of the inner ear."
https://openalex.org/W2087227977,"The rate of cell division decreases as tobacco leaves grow, and older leaves grow without any cell divisions. Disks were cut from leaves having differing degrees of cell division at various developmental stages. In the chlorenchy, induced susceptibility to photodestruction of chloroplasts was used to measure sensitivity to gamma radiation as a function of the rate of cell division. The same biological effect can thereby be studied both in dividing and in nondividing tissues of the same morphological and physiological cell types. The radiosensitivities were approximately the same, irrespective of the extent of cell divisions."
https://openalex.org/W2044914047,An image analysis computer has been used to count and measure goblet cells in the epithelium of the bronchiolar tree of rats exposed to sulfur dioxide vapor. A technique was developed which enabled a bioassay of the irritant effects of the gas.

https://openalex.org/W2066891023,A new activity of the teleost caudal neurosecretory system is described. Extracts of the urophysis of the mudsucker Gillichthys mirabilis and of the trout Salmo gairdnerii cause rhythmic contractions of the isolated urinary bladder of the trout. The dose-related response provides the basis for a quantitative bioassay of this urophysial principle.
https://openalex.org/W2074736964,Purines are actively accumulated by the isolated rabbit choroid plexus by a specific saturable transport mechanism. In vivo this system probably serves to excrete the purine catabolities of brain from cerebrospinal fluid into blood.
https://openalex.org/W2052612464,An effect of material from the caudal neurosecretory system of a teleost on the isolated toad bladder is described. Urophysial breis from Gillichthys mirabilis result in dose-related water movement across the bladder. As little as one one-hundredth of a urophysis induces a threefold increase in osmotic water movement.

https://openalex.org/W2062980692,"Chick interferon from allantoic fluid, virus-induced and partly purified, consists of several active components of different charge. The components are separable by elution at different pH values from a carboxymethyl-Sephadex column; they also occupy different pH zones in electrofocusing gradients. Most of the interferon is, however, isoelectric near neutrality."

https://openalex.org/W2049039066,The transport time of gas from the larynx to pulmonary alveolar capillary blood was directly measured by injecting a bolus of carbon monoxide into the inspired airstream of dogs and photoelectrically monitoring the formation of carboxyhemoglobin in the capillaries on the surface of the lung. The rapidity of transit (0.3 second) implies that gas transport during inspiration is facilitated by an interaction between bulk flow and diffusion.
