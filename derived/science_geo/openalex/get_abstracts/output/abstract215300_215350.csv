A measure of difference was found between the sclera, which behaved as ordinary mammalian collagen1–5, and the cornea, which showed a lower hydrothermal stability, in the sense that it shortened at a lower temperature than sclera or skin collagen."

After administration to rats, about 30 % of the radioactivity was recovered in urine and about 8% in feces. 3. The labeled products in urine consisted almost exclusively of more polar metabolites. 4. The main labeled urinary metabolite has been shown to be 2,3-dinorprostaglandin Fi,. 10 MINUTES AcknowledgmentsThe authors are greatly indebted to Dr. R. Ryhage for the mass spectrometric analyses. The technical assistance of Miss C. Carlon and Miss U. Hedin is gratefully 0 acknowledged. REFERENCES FIG. 4. Gas-liquid chromatography of the hydrogenated tri- acetate of Metabolite II.

Neamine and kanamycin have only a moderate effect, whereas streptomycin and dihydrostreptomycin are inactive3,4."

https://openalex.org/W1996429151,"THE lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) agent, detectable by increased levels of plasma or serum LDH in inoculated test mice, was found in association with a variety of transplanted murine tumours by Riley et al.1. Various estimations of its size by filtration methods have been suggested. These include diameters of 2 mµ, approximately 45 mµ, and 55 mµ (refs. 2, 3 and 4, respectively). In an attempt to resolve these conflicting observations, electron microscopic investigations of the LDH agent were initiated, and this report describes preliminary findings."
