https://openalex.org/W2110265246,"The inference of transcriptional networks that regulate transitions into physiological or pathological cellular states remains a central challenge in systems biology. A mesenchymal phenotype is the hallmark of tumour aggressiveness in human malignant glioma, but the regulatory programs responsible for implementing the associated molecular signature are largely unknown. Here we show that reverse-engineering and an unbiased interrogation of a glioma-specific regulatory network reveal the transcriptional module that activates expression of mesenchymal genes in malignant glioma. Two transcription factors (C/EBPbeta and STAT3) emerge as synergistic initiators and master regulators of mesenchymal transformation. Ectopic co-expression of C/EBPbeta and STAT3 reprograms neural stem cells along the aberrant mesenchymal lineage, whereas elimination of the two factors in glioma cells leads to collapse of the mesenchymal signature and reduces tumour aggressiveness. In human glioma, expression of C/EBPbeta and STAT3 correlates with mesenchymal differentiation and predicts poor clinical outcome. These results show that the activation of a small regulatory module is necessary and sufficient to initiate and maintain an aberrant phenotypic state in cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2091232725,"The bacterial and archaeal genomes that have been sequenced to date were chosen for sequencing based mainly on their physiology, which is fine but has resulted in a distinct phylogenetic bias. An alternative approach has been taken in the Genomic Encyclopedia of Bacteria and Archaea (GEBA) project, which advocates choosing genomes based on the organism's phylogenetic position, with the aim filling in the gaps in sequencing along on bacterial and archaeal branches of the tree of life. The value of this approach has been demonstrated by a pilot study of the genome sequences of 56 culturable species selected to maximize phylogenetic coverage. Analysis of the sequences provides insights into phylogenetics, protein function and genome annotation. There are now nearly 1,000 completed bacterial and archaeal genomes available, but as most of them were chosen for sequencing on the basis of their physiology, the data are limited by a highly biased phylogenetic distribution. To explore the value added by choosing microbial genomes for sequencing on the basis of their evolutionary relationships, the genomes of 56 species of Bacteria and Archaea selected to maximize phylogenetic coverage are now sequenced and analysed. Sequencing of bacterial and archaeal genomes has revolutionized our understanding of the many roles played by microorganisms1. There are now nearly 1,000 completed bacterial and archaeal genomes available2, most of which were chosen for sequencing on the basis of their physiology. As a result, the perspective provided by the currently available genomes is limited by a highly biased phylogenetic distribution3,4,5. To explore the value added by choosing microbial genomes for sequencing on the basis of their evolutionary relationships, we have sequenced and analysed the genomes of 56 culturable species of Bacteria and Archaea selected to maximize phylogenetic coverage. Analysis of these genomes demonstrated pronounced benefits (compared to an equivalent set of genomes randomly selected from the existing database) in diverse areas including the reconstruction of phylogenetic history, the discovery of new protein families and biological properties, and the prediction of functions for known genes from other organisms. Our results strongly support the need for systematic ‘phylogenomic’ efforts to compile a phylogeny-driven ‘Genomic Encyclopedia of Bacteria and Archaea’ in order to derive maximum knowledge from existing microbial genome data as well as from genome sequences to come."
https://openalex.org/W2133963438,"The clinical efficacy of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase inhibitors in EGFR-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is limited by the development of drug-resistance mutations, including the gatekeeper T790M mutation. Strategies targeting EGFR T790M with irreversible inhibitors have had limited success and are associated with toxicity due to concurrent inhibition of wild-type EGFR. All current EGFR inhibitors possess a structurally related quinazoline-based core scaffold and were identified as ATP-competitive inhibitors of wild-type EGFR. Here we identify a covalent pyrimidine EGFR inhibitor by screening an irreversible kinase inhibitor library specifically against EGFR T790M. These agents are 30- to 100-fold more potent against EGFR T790M, and up to 100-fold less potent against wild-type EGFR, than quinazoline-based EGFR inhibitors in vitro. They are also effective in murine models of lung cancer driven by EGFR T790M. Co-crystallization studies reveal a structural basis for the increased potency and mutant selectivity of these agents. These mutant-selective irreversible EGFR kinase inhibitors may be clinically more effective and better tolerated than quinazoline-based inhibitors. Our findings demonstrate that functional pharmacological screens against clinically important mutant kinases represent a powerful strategy to identify new classes of mutant-selective kinase inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2141856502,"Somatic cells can be reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by defined factors. However, the low efficiency and slow kinetics of the reprogramming process have hampered progress with this technology. Here we report that a natural compound, vitamin C (Vc), enhances iPSC generation from both mouse and human somatic cells. Vc acts at least in part by alleviating cell senescence, a recently identified roadblock for reprogramming. In addition, Vc accelerates gene expression changes and promotes the transition of pre-iPSC colonies to a fully reprogrammed state. Our results therefore highlight a straightforward method for improving the speed and efficiency of iPSC generation and provide additional insights into the mechanistic basis of the reprogramming process."
https://openalex.org/W2135640980,"Multiple somatic rearrangements are often found in cancer genomes; however, the underlying processes of rearrangement and their contribution to cancer development are poorly characterized. Here we use a paired-end sequencing strategy to identify somatic rearrangements in breast cancer genomes. There are more rearrangements in some breast cancers than previously appreciated. Rearrangements are more frequent over gene footprints and most are intrachromosomal. Multiple rearrangement architectures are present, but tandem duplications are particularly common in some cancers, perhaps reflecting a specific defect in DNA maintenance. Short overlapping sequences at most rearrangement junctions indicate that these have been mediated by non-homologous end-joining DNA repair, although varying sequence patterns indicate that multiple processes of this type are operative. Several expressed in-frame fusion genes were identified but none was recurrent. The study provides a new perspective on cancer genomes, highlighting the diversity of somatic rearrangements and their potential contribution to cancer development. It has been known for decades that many tumours contain genomic rearrangements, but little is known about their causes and effects. Using new 'paired-end' sequencing technologies, Stephens et al. have now mapped the chromosome rearrangements in human breast cancers at high resolution. They find more rearrangements than previously recognized, most of them intrachromosomal rather than interchromosomal. Tandem duplications were remarkably common in some breast cancers but essentially absent from others, and may reflect a novel mutator phenotype. Multiple somatic rearrangements are often found in cancer genomes, but the underlying processes of rearrangement and the effects of this are unclear. A paired-end sequencing strategy is now used to map somatic rearrangements in human breast cancer genomes. More rearrangements in some breast cancers are found than previously recognized, including frequent tandem duplications that may reflect a specific defect in DNA maintenance."

https://openalex.org/W2098591455,"Obesity and insulin resistance are associated with deposition of triglycerides in tissues other than adipose tissue. Previously, we showed that a missense mutation (I148M) in PNPLA3 (patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing 3 protein) is associated with increased hepatic triglyceride content in humans. Here we examined the effect of the I148M substitution on the enzymatic activity and cellular location of PNPLA3. Structural modeling predicted that the substitution of methionine for isoleucine at residue 148 would restrict access of substrate to the catalytic serine at residue 47. In vitro assays using recombinant PNPLA3 partially purified from Sf9 cells confirmed that the wild type enzyme hydrolyzes emulsified triglyceride and that the I148M substitution abolishes this activity. Expression of PNPLA3-I148M, but not wild type PNPLA3, in cultured hepatocytes or in the livers of mice increased cellular triglyceride content. Cell fractionation studies revealed that ∼90% of wild type PNPLA3 partitioned between membranes and lipid droplets; substitution of isoleucine for methionine at position 148 did not alter the subcellular distribution of the protein. These data are consistent with PNPLA3-I148M promoting triglyceride accumulation by limiting triglyceride hydrolysis. Obesity and insulin resistance are associated with deposition of triglycerides in tissues other than adipose tissue.

These data are consistent with PNPLA3-I148M promoting triglyceride accumulation by limiting triglyceride hydrolysis. Triglycerides are the major energy storage molecules in eukaryotes. In mammals, triglycerides are stored primarily in adipose tissue, which serves as an energy buffer during long term caloric depletion. Under conditions of sustained caloric excess, the deposition of triglycerides in non-adipose tissues may increase substantially, particularly in the liver. The extent of triglyceride accumulation varies markedly among individuals, ranging from less than 1% to more than 50% of liver weight in the general population (1.Browning J.D. Szczepaniak L.S. Dobbins R. Nuremberg P. Horton J.D. Cohen J.C. Grundy S.M. Hobbs H.H. Hepatology. 2004; 40: 1387-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (2934) Google Scholar). A variety of factors are associated with deposition of fat in the liver, including obesity, diabetes, insulin resistance, and alcohol ingestion, but the factors responsible for the wide individual differences in susceptibility to hepatic steatosis are not known (2.Browning J.D. Horton J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). Recently, we identified a nonsynonymous polymorphism in PNPLA3 (I148M) that is strongly associated with hepatic fat content and with elevated serum levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, which are markers of liver inflammation. Subsequent studies have confirmed the association of this allele with hepatic fat content, elevated circulating liver enzyme levels, and liver injury (3.Yuan B. Neuman R. Duan S.H. Weber J.L.

Taken together, these studies support the notion that sequence differences in PNPLA3 lead to both fat deposition and inflammation in the liver. The mechanism by which variation in PNPLA3 affects liver triglyceride content is not known. PNPLA3, alternatively referred to as adiponutrin, encodes a 481-amino acid protein of unknown function that belongs to the patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing family (8.Baulande S. Lasnier F. Lucas M. Pairault J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33336-33344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The progenitor of the family, patatin, is a major protein of potato tubers and has nonspecific lipid acyl hydrolase activity (9.Galliard T. Biochem. J. 1971; 121: 379-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). PNPLA3 is most closely related to PNPLA2 (adipose triglyceride lipase), which encodes the major triglyceride hydrolase of adipose tissue (10.Kienesberger P.C. Oberer M. Lass A. Zechner R. J. Lipid Res. 2009; 50: S63-S68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 11.Wilson P.A. Gardner S.D. Lambie N.M. Commans S.A. Crowther D.J. J.

Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 2477-2487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), but overexpression of PNPLA3 in human embryonic kidney cells is not associated with any change in cellular triglycerides (13.Lake A.C. Sun Y. Li J.L. Kim J.E. Johnson J.W. Li D. Revett T. Shih H.H. Liu W. Paulsen J.E. Gimeno R.E. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 2477-2487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), and small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of PNPLA3 does not affect the triglyceride content of 3T3-L1 cells (14.Kershaw E.E. Hamm J.K. Verhagen L.A. Peroni O. Katic M. Flier J.S. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 148-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Thus, it remains unclear if PNPLA3 functions as a triglyceride hydrolase in vivo. The tissue distribution and subcellular localization of PNPLA3 also have not been fully defined. Initially identified as a transcript restricted to the adipose lineage (8.Baulande S. Lasnier F. Lucas M. Pairault J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33336-33344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar); subsequent studies indicated that PNPLA3 is also expressed in other tissues, including the liver (13.Lake A.C.

Chem. 2001; 276: 33336-33344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) reported that recombinant PNPLA3 pelleted completely with the membrane fraction after ultracentrifugation at 150,000 × g. Immunolocalization studies using confocal microscopy localized epitope-tagged recombinant PNPLA3 to membranes (but not lipid droplets) in cultured adipocytes (8.Baulande S. Lasnier F. Lucas M. Pairault J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33336-33344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). These results were interpreted as being consistent with the prediction that PNPLA3 is an integral membrane protein with four transmembrane domains (8.Baulande S. Lasnier F. Lucas M. Pairault J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33336-33344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). To examine the role of PNPLA3 in triglyceride metabolism and elucidate the mechanism by which the I148M substitution affects liver fat content, we expressed wild type and mutant forms of the protein in Sf9 cells, in cultured hepatocytes, and in livers of mice. Our data indicate that PNPLA3 is a lipid droplet protein that can catalyze the hydrolysis of triglycerides in vitro. Overexpression of wild type PNPLA3 had little effect on triglyceride concentration in hepatocytes, but the I148M mutation promoted triglyceride accumulation when fatty acid acylation was inhibited, as did expression of an isoform of PNPLA3 containing a substitution in the catalytic site (S47A). These findings are consistent with the I148M substitution interfering with hepatic triglyceride hydrolysis and thus promoting hepatic steatosis. Rabbit anti-PNPLA3 polyclonal antibodies were raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 20 amino acids of human PNPLA3 (VPAGAEGLSTFPSFSLEKSL).

Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (6040) Google Scholar) was used to construct a homology model of the patatin-like domain of human PNPLA3 from this alignment, with the x-ray structure of heartleaf horsenettle patatin (Protein Data Bank code 1oxw) (18.Rydel T.J.

The model was visualized in PyMOL (19.DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific, LLC, Palo Alto, CA2002Google Scholar). The cDNA for human PNPLA3 was inserted upstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter/enhancer elements in pcDNA3.1- TOPO-V5-His (Invitrogen). Single nucleotide changes were introduced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. A V5-epitope tag (GKPIPNPLLGLDST) was placed at the C terminus of each plasmid construct except for PNPLA3-S47A. To produce recombinant baculoviruses, the human PNPLA3 cDNA was inserted into a pFASTBac1 vector (Invitrogen). A FLAG tag (DYKDDDDK) and a tandem array of 10 histidines were inserted at the C terminus of PNPLA3 using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Baculoviruses were prepared using the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system protocol (Invitrogen) for Sf9 cells. Conditioned medium from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells was used as a viral stock. Sf9 cells obtained from Invitrogen were grown to a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml (Grace's medium, Sigma) and infected (multiplicity of infection of 2) with recombinant baculovirus. Partially purified PNPLA3 was prepared as described by Jenkins et al. (12.Jenkins C.M. Mancuso D.J. Yan W. Sims H.F. Gibson B. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48968-48975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Seventy-two hours after infection, cells were centrifuged at 2600 × g for 15 min and resuspended in 30 ml of lysis buffer (25 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.8, containing 20% (v/v) glycerol and 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). Cells were lysed by sonication (1-s bursts, 40% power, 30 times with a Branson Digital Sonifier 450 (Danbury, CT)) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to separate cytosolic and membrane fractions. The cytosolic fraction (2 mg/ml) was mixed with 3 ml of cobalt-resin (Pierce) for 2 h at 4 °C and then loaded into an Econo-column (1.5 × 10 cm; Bio-Rad). The column was washed with 10 column volumes of lysis buffer plus 500 mm NaCl. PNPLA3 was eluted using an imidazole gradient (0–200 mm) in lysis buffer, and fractions containing the highest concentration of PNPLA3, as determined by Western blotting (see below), were used in the enzymatic assays. Triolein emulsions were prepared by sonicating 1.5 mg of unlabeled triolein (Sigma), 20 × 106 cpm of [9,10-3H]triolein (60 μCi/μmol), and 40 μg of egg yolk phosphatidylcholine (Sigma) in 1 ml of 170 mm potassium phosphate (K2HPO4), pH 7.0, containing 200 μm sodium taurocholate. After sonication, disodium EDTA and dithiothreitol were added to the emulsion to a final concentration of 4 mm. For each assay, 100 μl of the substrate, [9,10-3H]triolein, was mixed with partially purified PNPLA3 (20–80 μg οf protein) in a glass tube to a final concentration of 60 μm [9,10-3H]triolein. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min before the addition of 100 μl of butanol. The mixture was vortexed and then separated by centrifugation at 400 × g for 10 min. A total of 20 μl of the extracted lipids was loaded onto TLC plates and developed using chloroform/methanol/30% NH4OH (65/25/5) as the mobile phase. The lipids were visualized with iodine vapor, and the free fatty acid bands were scraped from the plates and quantitated by scintillation counting. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay according to the manufacturer's protocol (Bio-Rad). An equivalent proportion (by volume) of each cell fraction was added to 5× sample loading buffer (0.313 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% SDS, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 50% glycerol, 0.4 m dithiothreitol) to a final concentration of 1×. After heating to 95 °C for 5 min, the proteins were size-fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE at 150 V and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences) at 100 V for 1 h (20.Romeo S. Yin W. Kozlitina J. Pennacchio L.A. Boerwinkle E. Hobbs H.H. Cohen J.C. J. Clin. Invest. 2009; 119: 70-79PubMed Google Scholar). The membranes were incubated in TBST buffer (0.05 m Tris, 0.138 m NaCl, 2.7 μm KCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 8.0) with 5% dry nonfat milk (Nestle) at 4 °C overnight before adding the primary antibodies. Monoclonal anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen) and a polyclonal anti-calnexin antibody (Stressgen, Ann Arbor, MI) were diluted 1:5,000 in TBST buffer with 5% dry nonfat milk and incubated with membranes for 60 min. Membranes were washed three times for 10 min each in TBST buffer. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG or sheep anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences) was diluted (1:10,000) in TBST buffer plus 5% dry milk and incubated with membranes for 60 min. Membranes were subject to three 10-min washes in TBST and visualized using SuperSignal-enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). To generate cells that stably express PNPLA3, a human hepatoma cell line (HuH-7) was transfected with plasmids expressing wild type or mutant PNPLA3-V5. Three days after transfection, cells were passaged at low density in DMEM with 10% FCS containing 1 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Medium was changed every 2 days. After 7 days, cells were suspended with trypsin, counted, and seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 2 cells/well in DMEM with 10% FCS containing 1 mg/ml G418. Wells were inspected with a light microscope. Those wells containing a single colony were treated with trypsin, and the cells were transferred to 48-well plates. Once cells reached 80% confluence, they were split into 6-well plates, and expression of PNPLA3 was confirmed by immunoblotting. HuH-7 cells were grown to 90% confluence in DMEM with 10% FCS plus 100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and infected with recombinant adenoviruses (pShuttle, Clontech). After 48 h the medium was replaced with serum-free DMEM with 1 μCi of [14C]palmitic acid. After 4 h, the medium was changed to DMEM with 10% FCS, and 20 and 44 h later, the lipids were extracted from cells with chloroform/methanol using the method of Bligh and Dyer (21.Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42878) Google Scholar). The lipids were separated by TLC using hexanes/diethyl ether/acetic acid (80/20/2) and visualized with iodine vapor and with also with phosphorimaging (Storm 820 PhosphorImager, Amersham Biosciences). Bands were also scraped from the TLC plate, and the radioactivity was counted using a scintillation counter. In another set of experiments, HuH-7 cells were infected with recombinant adenoviruses for 48 h and then treated with 100 μm oleate and 1 μCi of [14C]palmitic acid and allowed to grow for 24 h. After 24 h, the medium was changed to DMEM and 10% FCS plus 5 μm triacsin C (Sigma), an inhibitor of long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (22.Omura S. Tomoda H. Xu Q.M. Takahashi Y. Iwai Y. J. Antibiot. 1986; 39: 1211-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). At timed intervals, the lipids were extracted from cells and analyzed by TLC as described above. The relative intensities of the bands on the TLC plate were quantitated using phosphorimaging. The signal from cells expressing wild type PNPLA3 at the zero time point was assigned a value of 1. Male C57Bl/6J mice purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) were housed in colony cages (≤5 mice/cage) maintained on a 12-h light/12-h dark daily cycle and fed standard chow diets (catalog number 7001; 4% fat, Harlan Teklad, Madison, WI). Five groups of six 12-week-old mice each were injected with 1.25 × 1011 recombinant adenoviral particles. Three days after injection, mice were sacrificed after a 4-h fast, and the liver and blood were collected. Lipids were extracted from 100–200 mg of frozen liver samples using the Folch and Lees method (23.Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Triglyceride, free fatty acid, total cholesterol, cholesteryl ester, free cholesterol, and phosphatidylcholine were measured using enzymatic assays (Infinity, Thermo Electron Corp. (Louisville, CO) and Wako Inc. (Richmond, VA)) and normalized to sample weight. Serum levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, triglyceride, cholesterol, and glucose were measured using the Vitros 250 system (GMI, Inc.). All research protocols were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas. For Oil Red O staining, the liver was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 2 days and equilibrated in 10% sucrose for 12 h and then in 18% sucrose for 12 h at 4 °C prior to cryosectioning. Cryosections of liver stored at −80 °C were brought to room temperature and air-dried for at least 2 h and then fixed in methanol-free 4% paraformaldehyde. Slides were washed with distilled water three times and then incubated for 10 min in 0.18% Oil Red O (Sigma) prepared in 60% isopropyl alcohol (24.Sheehan D.C. Hrapchak B.B. Theory and Practice of Histotechnology. 2nd Ed. Mosby, St. Louis1980: 205Google Scholar). The slides were washed in distilled water five times. Nuclei were counterstained with hematoxylin, and coverslips were affixed with aqueous mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). For cell fractionation studies, transfected cells were disrupted by passage through a 27-gauge needle in 450 μl of Buffer A (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.0, 250 mm sucrose, and 1 mm EDTA with protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)). Cell lysates were centrifuged (1000 × g), and membranes were isolated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of Buffer A, and equal proportions of the supernatant and pellet were analyzed by immunoblotting. For membrane extraction experiments, the membrane fractions prepared as described above were divided into four equal parts and centrifuged at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h. The membrane pellets were resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and incubated on ice for 1 h in buffer containing either 1 m NaCl, 0.2 m Na2CO3 (pH 11.3), 1% Triton X-100, or 2% SDS (pH 7.4). Soluble and insoluble fractions were separated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h. Lipid droplets were isolated from HuH-7 cell lines that stably expressed wild type PNPLA3 and PNPLA3-I148M as described (25.Brasaemle D.L. Wolins N.E. Current Protocols in Cell Biology. Wiley Interscience, New York2006: 3.15.1-3.15.12Google Scholar), except that cells were disrupted by passage through a 21-gauge needle 25 times, and the homogenates were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to pellet nuclei and unbroken cells. The supernatant was removed, and 100 μl was retained for immunoblot analysis. The remaining postnuclear supernatant was adjusted to a concentration of 20% sucrose using Buffer C (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA) plus 60% sucrose and added to the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube. A step gradient was constructed by overlaying the postnuclear supernatant with 5 ml of Buffer C plus 5% sucrose followed by Buffer C alone. The tube was clamped and centrifuged at 28,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the lipid layer was isolated by slicing the tube, combined with 20 volumes of −80 °C acetone, and stored overnight at −20 °C. The precipitated proteins were pelleted by centrifugation at 4,300 × g for 1 h at 4 °C and then resuspended in Buffer C plus 1% SDS. The lipid droplet proteins and postnuclear supernatant were subjected to immunoblotting using an anti-V5 antibody and monoclonal anti-ADRP antibody (Fitzgerald Industries International, Concord, MA). Experiments were also conducted using a modification of this protocol in which lipid droplets were isolated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g. HuH-7 cells were grown on glass coverslips. The cells were washed with PBS and then incubated for 4 h at 37 °C in serum-free medium with 6 × 109 recombinant adenoviral particles. The cells were refed with DMEM with 10% FCS in the presence or absence of oleate-conjugated albumin (400 μm). The following day, cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, quenched in 1% (w/v) l-glycine in PBS for 10 min, and permeabilized in 0.05% (w/v) Triton X-100 (Pierce) in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Fixed/permeabilized cells were then blocked for 30 min in PBS plus 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 0.025% (w/v) Triton X-100. Cells were stained with the anti-V5 antibody (dilution 1:500) overnight at 4 °C followed by a 1-h incubation at room temperature with Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen) (2 μg/ml) and 1 μg/ml of boron dipyrromethene (Invitrogen). Both incubations with the primary and secondary antibodies were followed by three 5-min washes in PBS with 0.025% Triton X-100. The coverslips were rinsed in PBS prior to mounting with a 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole-containing mounting medium (Vectashield, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and imaged on a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope using an HCX PL APO ×63/1.40–0.60 oil objective. A structural model of the patatin-like domain of PNPLA3 was developed to examine the effect of substituting methionine for isoleucine at residue 148. In this model, the side chain of the isoleucine at residue 148 is located adjacent to the Ser47-Asp166 catalytic dyad (Fig. 1) and comprises part of a hydrophobic substrate-binding groove in the active site. Substitution of methionine for isoleucine is not predicted to alter the orientation of the catalytic dyad, but the longer side chain of methionine restricts access of substrate to the catalytic serine, thus inactivating PNPLA3. To test this prediction, we expressed both the wild type and the mutant forms of the enzyme in Sf9 cells and determined the effect of the substitution on the ability of the enzyme to hydrolyze triglyceride, as described previously by Jenkins et al. (12.Jenkins C.M. Mancuso D.J. Yan W. Sims H.F. Gibson B. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48968-48975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Wild type PNPLA3 hydrolyzed emulsified triolein (Fig. 2A) in both a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, PNPLA3-I148M did not catalyze triglyceride hydrolysis at any enzyme level or time point examined (Fig. 2B). To determine if the mutant isoform of PNPLA3 inhibited the activity of the wild type protein, equal amounts of partially purified wild type and mutant PNPLA3 were added to the substrate. The triglyceride hydrolase activity was intermediate between the wild type and mutant preparations (Fig. 2C). Thus, the mutant protein did not inhibit the activity of the wild type enzyme, at least in vitro. These findings are consistent with the prediction that the substitution of methionine for isoleucine at residue 148 of PNPLA3 limits access of substrate to the catalytic residues. To determine the effect of the I148M substitution in vivo, we used recombinant adenoviruses to overexpress wild type and mutant forms of human PNPLA3 in the livers of mice (Fig. 3). Oil Red O staining of the liver sections revealed that overexpression of wild type PNPLA3 had no discernable effect on liver triglyceride content or distribution. Both the number and size of the lipid droplets in mice expressing wild type PNPLA3 were similar to those observed in animals infected with vector alone (Fig. 3A). Similarly, infection with virus expressing the S453I allele, a sequence variation associated with lower hepatic triglyceride content in humans (26.Romeo S. Kozlitina J. Xing C. Pertsemlidis A. Cox D. Pennacchio L.A. Boerwinkle E. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. Nat. Genet. 2008; 40: 1461-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (2255) Google Scholar), did not affect the pattern or amount of Oil Red O staining. Enzymatic measurements of tissue triglyceride levels confirmed that there was no change in hepatic triglyceride content in these mice (Fig. 3C). In contrast to these results, administration of viruses expressing PNPLA3-I148M or a catalytically dead form of the enzyme (S47A) was associated with a dramatic increase in the number of lipid droplets (Fig. 3A) and in the tissue levels of triglycerides and cholesterol esters (Fig. 3C). The size of the lipid droplets tended to be larger in the mice expressing either PNPLA3-I148M or PNPLA3-S47A. Similar levels of recombinant protein were expressed in the livers of mice receiving wild type and I148M viruses (Fig. 3B). (No V5 tag was present on the PNPLA3-S47A construct, so the protein was not detected by immunoblotting in this experiment). No significant differences were found in the levels of hepatic free fatty acids, phospholipids, or free cholesterol in any of the mice in this study (Fig. 3C and Table 1). Similar results were obtained in ob/ob mice, which have high levels of liver triglycerides. Hepatic steatosis in these animals was not altered by overexpression of wild type PNPLA3 and was exacerbated by the mutant proteins (I148M and S47A) (supplemental Fig. 1).TABLE 1Characterization of liver and serum lipids and enzymes in mice infected with recombinant adenoviruses expressing wild type or mutant PNPLA3Empty adenovirusPNPLA3 adenovirusWild typeI148MS453IS47ABody weight (g)27.5 ± 2.528.2 ± 1.027.2 ± 1.627.4 ± 1.028.1 ± 2.4Liver/body weight (×100)5.2 ± 0.25.4 ± 0.45.63 ± 0.35.28 ± 0.15.49 ± 0.3LiverTriglyceride (mg/g)12.7 ± 5.613.5 ± 2.948.4 ± 11.313.5 ± 2.042.5 ± 10.1Phosphotidylcholine (mg/g)15.3 ± 0.514.2 ± 0.814.2 ± 0.915.5 ± 1.214.9 ± 0.9Free fatty acids (μmol/g)9.3 ± 1.58.5 ± 1.98.7 ± 0.98.8 ± 1.210.7 ± 1.8Cholesterol esters (mg/g)0.2 ± 0.00.3 ± 0.0.10.5 ± 0.10.1 ± 0.00.5 ± 0.2Free cholesterol (mg/g)2.1 ± 0.11.9 ± 0.12.0 ± 0.12.1 ± 0.22.1 ± 0.1Cholesterol (mg/g)2.3 ± 0.12.2 ± 0.12.4 ± 0.22.3 ± 0.22.6 ± 0.2BloodAlanine aminotransferase (units/liter)53.3 ± 13.0102.8 ± 42.592.2 ± 29.4128.7 ± 63.185.5 ± 30.8Aspartate aminotransferase (units/li"

https://openalex.org/W2076687053,"Oxidative stress in skeletal muscle is a hallmark of various pathophysiologic states that also feature increased reliance on long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) substrate, such as insulin resistance and exercise. However, little is known about the mechanistic basis of the LCFA-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) burden in intact mitochondria, and elucidation of this mechanistic basis was the goal of this study. Specific aims were to determine the extent to which LCFA catabolism is associated with ROS production and to gain mechanistic insights into the associated ROS production. Because intermediates and by-products of LCFA catabolism may interfere with antioxidant mechanisms, we predicted that ROS formation during LCFA catabolism reflects a complex process involving multiple sites of ROS production as well as modified mitochondrial function. Thus, we utilized several complementary approaches to probe the underlying mechanism(s). Using skeletal muscle mitochondria, our findings indicate that even a low supply of LCFA is associated with ROS formation in excess of that generated by NADH-linked substrates. Moreover, ROS production was evident across the physiologic range of membrane potential and was relatively insensitive to membrane potential changes. Determinations of topology and membrane potential as well as use of inhibitors revealed complex III and the electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) and ETF-oxidoreductase, as likely sites of ROS production. Finally, ROS production was sensitive to matrix levels of LCFA catabolic intermediates, indicating that mitochondrial export of LCFA catabolic intermediates can play a role in determining ROS levels."

The mechanism by which ACF mobilizes nucleosomes remains poorly understood. Here we report a single-molecule FRET study that monitors the remodelling of individual nucleosomes by ACF in real time, revealing previously unknown remodelling intermediates and dynamics. In the presence of ACF and ATP, the nucleosomes exhibit gradual translocation along DNA interrupted by well-defined kinetic pauses that occurred after approximately seven or three to four base pairs of translocation. The binding of ACF, translocation of DNA and exiting of translocation pauses are all ATP-dependent, revealing three distinct functional roles of ATP during remodelling. At equilibrium, a continuously bound ACF complex can move the nucleosome back-and-forth many times before dissociation, indicating that ACF is a highly processive and bidirectional nucleosome translocase. The ATP-dependent chromatin remodeller ACF generates regularly spaced nucleosomes, but the mechanism of nucleosome mobilization remains poorly understood.

https://openalex.org/W2011958170,"Evenly spaced nucleosomes directly correlate with condensed chromatin and gene silencing. The ATP-dependent chromatin assembly factor (ACF) forms such structures in vitro and is required for silencing in vivo. ACF generates and maintains nucleosome spacing by constantly moving a nucleosome towards the longer flanking DNA faster than the shorter flanking DNA. How the enzyme rapidly moves back and forth between both sides of a nucleosome to accomplish bidirectional movement is unknown. Here we show that nucleosome movement depends cooperatively on two ACF molecules, indicating that ACF functions as a dimer of ATPases. Further, the nucleotide state determines whether the dimer closely engages one or both sides of the nucleosome. Three-dimensional reconstruction by single-particle electron microscopy of the ATPase–nucleosome complex in an activated ATP state reveals a dimer architecture in which the two ATPases face each other. Our results indicate a model in which the two ATPases work in a coordinated manner, taking turns to engage either side of a nucleosome, thereby allowing processive bidirectional movement. This novel dimeric motor mechanism differs from that of dimeric motors such as kinesin and dimeric helicases that processively translocate unidirectionally and reflects the unique challenges faced by motors that move nucleosomes. The ATP-dependent chromatin remodeller ACF generates and maintains nucleosome spacing by constantly moving a nucleosome towards the longer flanking DNA faster than the shorter flanking DNA. But how the enzyme moves back and forth between both sides of a nucleosome to accomplish bidirectional movement is unknown.

https://openalex.org/W2045318822,"Synaptic degeneration, including impairment of synaptic plasticity and loss of synapses, is an important feature of Alzheimer disease pathogenesis. Increasing evidence suggests that these degenerative synaptic changes are associated with an accumulation of soluble oligomeric assemblies of amyloid beta (Abeta) known as ADDLs. In primary hippocampal cultures ADDLs bind to a subpopulation of neurons. However the molecular basis of this cell type-selective interaction is not understood. Here, using siRNA screening technology, we identified alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor subunits and calcineurin as candidate genes potentially involved in ADDL-neuron interactions. Immunocolocalization experiments confirmed that ADDL binding occurs in dendritic spines that express surface AMPA receptors, particularly the calcium-impermeable type II AMPA receptor subunit (GluR2). Pharmacological removal of the surface AMPA receptors or inhibition of AMPA receptors with antagonists reduces ADDL binding. Furthermore, using co-immunoprecipitation and photoreactive amino acid cross-linking, we found that ADDLs interact preferentially with GluR2-containing complexes. We demonstrate that calcineurin mediates an endocytotic process that is responsible for the rapid internalization of bound ADDLs along with surface AMPA receptor subunits, which then both colocalize with cpg2, a molecule localized specifically at the postsynaptic endocytic zone of excitatory synapses that plays an important role in activity-dependent glutamate receptor endocytosis. Both AMPA receptor and calcineurin inhibitors prevent oligomer-induced surface AMPAR and spine loss. These results support a model of disease pathogenesis in which Abeta oligomers interact selectively with neurotransmission pathways at excitatory synapses, resulting in synaptic loss via facilitated endocytosis. Validation of this model in human disease would identify therapeutic targets for Alzheimer disease."
https://openalex.org/W2040430939,"'Blue stragglers' are massive stars in clusters — where all the stars are pretty much the same age — that at their luminosity, should have evolved to become giants and white dwarfs. They are thought to be normal main-sequence stars that have gained mass through either transfer between binary companions or direct collision and merger between two stars. A study of the highly crowded star cluster M 30 suggests that both of these mechanisms are at work during the dramatic phase of the cluster core collapse. Two distinct parallel sequences of blue stragglers are present in M 30, a 'bluer' population arising from direct stellar collisions and a 'redder' one from the evolution of close binaries. Observations of the 21 blue stragglers in the old open cluster NGC 188 show that 16 (76%) are currently in binary systems, a frequency three times that found among normal solar-type main-sequence stars. Most of the NGC 188 blue stragglers are rotating faster than normal main-sequence stars of the same surface temperatures. In News & Views, Melvyn Davies reflects on what these two studies say about the origin of blue stragglers. 'Blue straggler' stars lie on or near the main sequence of star clusters and are sufficiently massive that they should have evolved into white dwarfs long ago. Two possible mechanisms have been proposed for their formation: mass transfer between binary companions and stellar mergers resulting from direct collisions between two stars. Here, two distinct parallel sequences of blue stragglers are reported in the globular cluster M 30, one arising from the evolution of close binaries, the other from direct collisions. Stars in globular clusters are generally believed to have all formed at the same time, early in the Galaxy’s history1. ‘Blue stragglers’ are stars massive enough2 that they should have evolved into white dwarfs long ago. Two possible mechanisms have been proposed for their formation: mass transfer between binary companions3 and stellar mergers resulting from direct collisions between two stars4. Recently the binary explanation was claimed to be dominant5. Here we report that there are two distinct parallel sequences of blue stragglers in M 30. This globular cluster is thought to have undergone ‘core collapse’, during which both the collision rate and the mass transfer activity in binary systems would have been enhanced6. We suggest that the two observed sequences are a consequence of cluster core collapse, with the bluer population arising from direct stellar collisions and the redder one arising from the evolution of close binaries that are probably still experiencing an active phase of mass transfer."
https://openalex.org/W1998225262,"The antiapoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family are expressed at high levels in many types of cancer. However, the mechanism by which Bcl-2 family proteins regulate apoptosis is not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate the interaction of Bcl-2 with the outer mitochondrial membrane protein, voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1). A direct interaction of Bcl-2 with bilayer-reconstituted purified VDAC was demonstrated, with Bcl-2 decreasing channel conductance. Expression of Bcl-2-GFP prevented apoptosis in cells expressing native but not certain VDAC1 mutants. VDAC1 sequences and amino acid residues important for interaction with Bcl-2 were defined through site-directed mutagenesis. Synthetic peptides corresponding to the VDAC1 N-terminal region and selected sequences bound specifically, in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, to immobilized Bcl-2, as revealed by the real-time surface plasmon resonance. Moreover, expression of the VDAC1-based peptides in cells over-expressing Bcl-2 prevented Bcl-2-mediated protection against staurosporine-induced apoptotic cell death. Similarly, a cell-permeable VDAC1-based synthetic peptide was also found to prevent Bcl-2-GFP-mediated protection against apoptosis. These results point to Bcl-2 as promoting tumor cell survival through binding to VDAC1, thereby inhibiting cytochrome c release and apoptotic cell death.

Still, the proposed structure of the recombinant refolded protein has been questioned (31.Colombini M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2009; 34: 382-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Apparently, VDAC1 adopts a β-barrel architecture composed of 19 β-strands with an α-helix positioned horizontally midway within the pore, proposed to regulate the conductance of ions and metabolites passing through the VDAC1 pore (28.Bayrhuber M. Meins T. Habeck M. Becker S. Giller K. Villinger S. Vonrhein C. Griesinger C. Zweckstetter M. Zeth K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 15370-15375Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). However, biochemical and biophysical approaches point to the N-terminal α-helix as alternatively being exposed to the cytoplasm (32.De Pinto V. Messina A. Accardi R. Aiello R. Guarino F.

These reports and other findings thus suggest that the N-terminal region of VDAC1 constitutes a mobile component of the protein, exhibiting motion during voltage gating (37.Mannella C.A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Moreover, such mobility of the N-terminal VDAC1 α-helix may modulate the accessibility of apoptosis-regulating proteins of the Bcl-2 family (i.e. Bax and Bcl-xL) to their binding sites on VDAC1 (38.Shi Y. Chen J. Weng C. Chen R. Zheng Y. Chen Q. Tang H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 989-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Recently, we have demonstrated that the antiapoptotic proteins, hexokinase (HK) and Bcl-2, interact with the N-terminal region of VDAC1 to inhibit mitochondria-mediated apoptosis (16.Abu-Hamad S. Arbel N. Calo D. Arzoine L. Israelson A. Keinan N. Ben-Romano R. Friedman O. Shoshan-Barmatz V. J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 1906-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 19.Arzoine L.

Cytochrome c release induced by Bax and Bim was found to be inhibited by anti-VDAC antibodies (43.Shimizu S. Matsuoka Y. Shinohara Y. Yoneda Y. Tsujimoto Y. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 237-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), whereas Bid (but not Bax) was shown to modify the conductance of VDAC channels (44.Rostovtseva T.K. Antonsson B. Suzuki M.

The interaction of Bcl-xL with VDAC1 was also demonstrated using NMR spectroscopy (18.Malia T.J. Wagner G. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 514-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 29.Hiller S.

Bcl-xL was further shown to modify the oligomerization state of VDAC1, as revealed by chemical cross-linking of micelle-bound VDAC1, shifting the equilibrium from the trimeric to the dimeric state (18.Malia T.J. Wagner G. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 514-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 29.Hiller S. Garces R.G. Malia T.J. Orekhov V.Y. Colombini M. Wagner G.

Chem. 2008; 283: 13482-13490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that VDAC1 interacts with both Bax and Bcl-xL to form a tertiary complex and that Bcl-xL interacts with VDAC via a putative loop region of VDAC1 (38.Shi Y. Chen J. Weng C. Chen R. Zheng Y. Chen Q. Tang H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 989-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In addition, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL were proposed to interact with VDAC to block As2O3-induced VDAC dimerization (45.Zheng Y. Shi Y. Tian C. Jiang C. Jin H. Chen J. Almasan A. Tang H. Chen Q. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1239-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). These results indicate that Bcl-2 family proteins regulate VDAC-mediated apoptosis and hence, the release of apoptogenic proteins from mitochondria. In this study, through various experimental approaches, we demonstrate the interaction of Bcl-2 with VDAC and the subsequent modulation of apoptosis. Purified Bcl-2(ΔC23) reduced channel conductance of native but not mutated VDAC1 reconstituted into a planar lipid bilayer (PLB). Using site-directed mutagenesis, we identified VDAC1 domains that are involved in the interaction of the protein with Bcl-2 to confer protection against apoptosis. These VDAC1 domains were used as templates for creating VDAC1-based recombinant and synthetic peptides. The interaction of such peptides with Bcl-2 was demonstrated using surface plasmon resonance or when peptide expression prevented Bcl-2-mediated protection against cell death. These results thus offer new insight into the function of VDAC in mediating Bcl-2 antiapoptotic activity, actions that promote the survival of tumor cells.

The four VDAC1 loop-shaped peptides, i.e. AP-W to DP-W, were designed to be flanked by a tryptophan zipper motif, namely the SWTWE amino acid sequence, at the N terminus of the peptide and the KWTWK sequence at the C terminus of the peptide. The presence of these sequences induces the formation of a stable β-hairpin. See supplemental data for additional information.

Synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to these sequences and containing AgeI and NotI restriction sites were cloned into the GFP-less pEGFP plasmid. Sequence fidelity was confirmed by sequencing. T-REx-293 cells, corresponding to transformed primary human embryonal kidney cells expressing the tetracycline repressor (Invitrogen), were maintained in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C with 5% CO2.

Gincel D. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 39: 279-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). For recombinant VDAC1 purification, mVDAC1 and E72Q-mVDAC1 were expressed in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae M22-2 por1 mutant strain (46.Zaid H. Abu-Hamad S. Israelson A. Nathan I. Shoshan-Barmatz V. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) and purified from mitochondria as was rat liver mitochondria VDAC. DNA encoding Bcl-2(ΔC23) cloned in the pHisparallel1 vector and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells. Bacteria were grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.4, exposed to a heat shock of 40 °C for 2 h, followed by induction of expression with isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside for 30–60 min at 20 °C. Following sonication and centrifugation, the soluble fraction (∼5–10% of the total expressed Bcl-2(ΔC23)) was purified by chromatography using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (5 ml). Bcl-2(ΔC23) was eluted from the column by a linear gradient of imadazol (10–500 mm). Purified Bcl-2(ΔC23) in 300 mm NaCl was stored in aliquots at −80 °C. Single and multiple channel current recording and data analysis were carried out as described previously (47.Gincel D. Zaid H. Shoshan-Barmatz V. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Briefly, a PLB was prepared from soybean asolectin dissolved in n-decane (50 mg/ml). Purified VDAC (∼1–10 ng) was added to the chamber defined as the cis side containing 1 or 0.5 m NaCl. After one or a few channels were inserted into the PLB, excess protein was removed by prefusing the cis chamber with ∼20 volumes of solution to prevent further incorporation. Following several recordings of channel activity at different voltages, purified Bcl-2(ΔC23) (∼1–2 μg) was added, and currents through the channel were again recorded. Recordings were made under voltage clamp using a Bilayer Clamp BC-535B amplifier (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT). Currents were measured with respect to the trans side of the membrane (ground). The currents were low pass-filtered at 1 kHz and digitized on-line using a Digidata 1440-interface board and Clampex 10.2 software (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). The interaction of purified Bcl-2(ΔC23) with membrane-bound peptide arrays was assayed following membrane washing (3 times, 10 min each) with Tris-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4), followed by a 3-h incubation with blocking buffer (Tris-buffered saline containing low-fat dry milk, 3.5%, w/v). The membranes were then incubated overnight with purified Bcl-2(ΔC23) (2 μm in blocking buffer) at 4 °C. Following extensive membrane washing with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20, Bcl-2(ΔC23) binding was detected using monoclonal anti-Bcl-2 antibodies and HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG as a secondary antibody.

The N-terminal and DP peptides were dissolved in water, whereas the other peptides were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR), using the ProteOn-XPR36 system (Bio-Rad) was employed to study the interactions of VDAC1-based synthetic peptides with purified Bcl-2(CΔ23). Purified Bcl-2(CΔ23) and rabbit IgG were immobilized onto a GLM sensor surface, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The peptides were diluted in running buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.005% Tween 20, 4% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide, phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4) and injected onto the sensor chip at varying concentrations, at a flow rate of 40 μl/min. All experiments were carried out at 25 °C. Responses (resonance units) were monitored using the ProteOn imaging system and related software tools. Signals were normalized using appropriate controls. To determine the extent of apoptosis, cells were subjected to staining with acridine orange and ethidium bromide, as described previously (46.Zaid H. Abu-Hamad S. Israelson A. Nathan I.

https://openalex.org/W1966052933,"Ficolins are oligomeric innate immune recognition proteins consisting of a collagen-like region and a fibrinogen-like recognition domain that bind to pathogen- and apoptotic cell-associated molecular patterns. To investigate their carbohydrate binding specificities, serum-derived L-ficolin and recombinant H- and M-ficolins were fluorescently labeled, and their carbohydrate binding ability was analyzed by glycan array screening. L-ficolin preferentially recognized disulfated N-acetyllactosamine and tri- and tetrasaccharides containing terminal galactose or N-acetylglucosamine. Binding was sensitive to the position and orientation of the bond between N-acetyllactosamine and the adjacent carbohydrate. No significant binding of H-ficolin to any of the 377 glycans probed could be detected, providing further evidence for its poor lectin activity. M-ficolin bound preferentially to 9-O-acetylated 2-6-linked sialic acid derivatives and to various glycans containing sialic acid engaged in a 2-3 linkage. To further investigate the structural basis of sialic acid recognition by M-ficolin, point mutants were produced in which three residues of the fibrinogen domain were replaced by their counterparts in L-ficolin. Mutations G221F and A256V inhibited binding to the 9-O-acetylated sialic acid derivatives, whereas Y271F abolished interaction with all sialic acid-containing glycans. The crystal structure of the Y271F mutant fibrinogen domain was solved, showing that the mutation does not alter the structure of the ligand binding pocket. These analyses reveal novel ficolin ligands such as sulfated N-acetyllactosamine (L-ficolin) and gangliosides (M-ficolin) and provide precise insights into the sialic acid binding specificity of M-ficolin, emphasizing the essential role of Tyr(271) in this respect."

https://openalex.org/W2059148293,"De novo lipogenesis (DNL) is paradoxically up-regulated by its end product, saturated fatty acids (SAFAs). We tested the hypothesis that SAFA-induced up-regulation of DNL reflects coordinate up-regulation of elongation and desaturation pathways for disposal of SAFAs and production of monounsaturated fatty acids to protect cells from SAFA toxicity. Human preadipocytes were differentiated in vitro for 14 days with [U-(13)C]palmitate (0-200 microM) to distinguish exogenous fatty acids from those synthesized by DNL. Exogenous palmitate up-regulated DNL (p < 0.001) concomitantly with SCD and elongation (each p < 0.001). Adipocytes from some donors were intolerant to high palmitate concentrations (400 microM). Palmitate-intolerant cells showed lower TG accumulation. They had lower expression of SCD mRNA and less monounsaturated fatty acids in TG, emphasizing the importance of desaturation for dealing with exogenous SAFAs. There was greater [U-(13)C]palmitate incorporation in phospholipids. SCD knockdown with small interfering RNA caused down-regulation of DNL and of expression of DNL-related genes, with reduced membrane fluidity (p < 0.02) and insulin sensitivity (p < 0.01), compared with scrambled small interfering RNA controls. There was preferential channeling of DNL-derived versus exogenous palmitate into elongation and of DNL-derived versus exogenous stearate into desaturation. DNL may not act primarily to increase fat stores but may serve as a key regulator, in tandem with elongation and desaturation, to maintain cell membrane fluidity and insulin sensitivity within the human adipocyte."
https://openalex.org/W2129409686,"Increasing adipocyte size as well as numbers is important in the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes, with adipocytes being generated from mesenchymal precursor cells. This process includes the determination of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) into preadipocytes (PA) and the differentiation of PA into mature fat cells. Although the process of differentiation has been highly investigated, the determination in humans is poorly understood. In this study, we compared human MSC and human committed PA on a cellular and molecular level to gain further insights into the regulatory mechanisms in the determination process. Both cell types showed similar morphology and expression patterns of common mesenchymal and hematopoietic surface markers. However, although MSC were able to differentiate into adipocytes and osteocytes, PA were only able to undergo adipogenesis, indicating that PA lost their multipotency during determination. WNT-5a expression showed significantly higher levels in MSC compared with PA suggesting that WNT-5a down-regulation might be important in the determination process. Indeed, incubation of human MSC in medium containing neutralizing WNT-5a antibodies abolished their ability to undergo osteogenesis, although adipogenesis was still possible. An opposite effect was achieved using recombinant WNT-5a protein. On a molecular level, WNT-5a was found to promote c-Jun N-terminal kinase-dependent intracellular signaling in MSC. Activation of this noncanonical pathway resulted in the induction of osteopontin expression further indicating pro-osteogenic effects of WNT-5a. Our data suggest that WNT-5a is necessary to maintain osteogenic potential of MSC and that inhibition of WNT-5a signaling therefore plays a role in their determination into PA in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2127539800,"Bleomycin is used in combination with other antineoplastic agents to effectively treat lymphomas, testicular carcinomas, and squamous cell carcinomas of the cervix, head, and neck. However, resistance to bleomycin remains a persistent limitation in exploiting the full therapeutic benefit of the drug with other types of cancers. Previously, we documented that the Saccharomyces cerevisiae L-carnitine transporter Agp2 is responsible for the high affinity uptake of polyamines and of the polyamine analogue bleomycin-A5. Herein, we document that the human L-carnitine transporter hCT2 encoded by the SLC22A16 gene is involved in bleomycin-A5 uptake, as well as polyamines. We show that NT2/D1 human testicular cancer cells, which highly express hCT2, are extremely sensitive to bleomycin-A5, whereas HCT116 human colon carcinoma cells devoid of detectable hCT2 expression or MCF-7 human breast cancer cells that only weakly express the permease showed striking resistance to the drug. NT2/D1 cells accumulated fluorescein-labeled bleomycin-A5 to substantially higher levels than HCT116 cells. Moreover, L-carnitine protected NT2/D1 cells from the lethal effects of bleomycin-A5 by preventing its influx, and siRNA targeted to hCT2 induced resistance to bleomycin-A5-dependent genotoxicity. Furthermore, hCT2 overexpression induced by transient transfection of a functional hCT2-GFP fusion protein sensitized HCT116 cells to bleomycin-A5. Collectively, our data strongly suggest that hCT2 can mediate bleomycin-A5 and polyamine uptake, and that the rate of bleomycin-A5 accumulation may account for the differential response to the drug in patients."

ERK1/2 are important signaling molecules regulating cellular growth and differentiation. The ERK1/2 signaling pathway is implicated in cardiac development and hypertrophy. However, the role of ERK1/2 in the development of atherosclerosis, particularly in macrophage cholesterol homeostasis, is unknown. In this study, we investigated the effects of ERK1/2 activity on macrophage ABCA1 expression and cholesterol efflux. Compared with a minor effect by inhibition of other kinases, inhibition of ERK1/2 significantly increased macrophage cholesterol efflux to apoAI and HDL. In contrast, activation of ERK1/2 reduced macrophage cholesterol efflux and ABCA1 expression. The increased cholesterol efflux by ERK1/2 inhibitors was associated with the increased ABCA1 levels and the binding of apoAI to cells. The increased ABCA1 by ERK1/2 inhibitors was due to increased ABCA1 mRNA and protein stability. The induction of ABCA1 expression and cholesterol efflux by ERK1/2 inhibitors was concentration-dependent. The mechanism study indicated that activation of liver X receptor (LXR) had little effect on ERK1/2 expression and activation. ERK1/2 inhibitors had no effect on macrophage LXRα/β expression, whereas they did not influence the activation or the inhibition of the ABCA1 promoter by LXR or sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP). However, inhibition of ERK1/2 and activation of LXR synergistically induced macrophage cholesterol efflux and ABCA1 expression.

Anti-atherogenic properties of ABCA1 have been well investigated in both humans and animal models. In humans, mutations in ABCA1 expression cause Tangier disease, which is characterized by very low levels of serum HDL cholesterol, rapid catabolism of apoAI, severe cholesteryl ester accumulation in peripheral tissues, and a high risk of development of coronary heart disease (14.Brooks-Wilson A.

The heterodimer of LXR/retinoid X receptor binds to the LXR response element (LXRE) in the proximal region of ABCA1 gene promoter and induces ABCA1 transcription. Thus, synthetic LXR ligands can inhibit the development of atherosclerosis in animal models (21.Joseph S.B. McKilligin E. Pei L. Watson M.A. Collins A.R. Laffitte B.A. Chen M. Noh G. Goodman J.

Hajjar D.P. Han J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 2129-2138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In macrophages, SREBP1 suppresses ABCA1 expression in an E-box-independent manner (19.Zeng L. Liao H. Liu Y. Lee T.S. Zhu M. Wang X. Stemerman M.B. Zhu Y. Shyy J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48801-48807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Most of the oxysterols can suppress SREBPs. Therefore, they increase ABCA1 expression. Interestingly, some oxysterols, such as 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol, function as LXR ligands and SREBP suppressors simultaneously. The simultaneous activation of LXR and inactivation of SREBP by this type of oxysterols synergistically induce ABCA1 expression. In addition to transcription factors, the cellular ABCA1 levels are also regulated by post-translational mechanisms. ABCA1 is a molecule with a half-life of ∼1–2 h. Thus, the decreased ABCA1 degradation by apoAI results in increased ABCA1 levels, whereas the enhanced ABCA1 degradation by unsaturated fatty acids decreases ABCA1 levels (25.Arakawa R. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22426-22429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 26.Wang Y. Oram J.F. J. Biol.

Extracellular signal regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) or p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinases (p44/42 MAPK) belong to a highly conserved family of Ser-Thr protein kinases and have been were characterized to function through the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK1/2 cascade (27.Sebolt-Leopold J.S. Herrera R. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 937-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar). ERK1/2 are implicated in wide cellular processes, such as in embryogenesis, differentiation, proliferation, and cell death (28.Pearson G. Robinson F. Beers Gibson T. Xu B.E. Karandikar M. Berman K. Cobb M.H. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 153-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (3523) Google Scholar). ERK1/2 are ubiquitously expressed in all tissues/cell types and are strongly activated by multiple stimuli, including growth factors, such as epithelial growth factor (EGF) (28.Pearson G. Robinson F. Beers Gibson T. Xu B.E. Karandikar M. Berman K. Cobb M.H. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 153-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (3523) Google Scholar). In fact, overexpression or constitutive activation of ERK1/2 pathway can lead to progression of several cancers. Inhibitors of ERK1/2 have been investigated as potential therapeutic targets for cancer treatment (27.Sebolt-Leopold J.S. Herrera R. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 937-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar). ERK1/2 have also been demonstrated to play a role in several aspects of cardiac system, such as cardiac development, hypertrophy, and protection (29.Wang Y. Circulation. 2007; 116: 1413-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear if ERK1/2 play an important role in macrophage cholesterol metabolism and trafficking as well as the development of atherosclerosis. In this study, we investigated the effects of ERK1/2 activity on macrophage free cholesterol efflux and ABCA1 expression. We found that inhibition of ERK1/2 greatly increased macrophage free cholesterol efflux to apoAI and HDL. This increased cholesterol efflux was associated with ABCA1 expression. Further, the increased macrophage ABCA1 expression occurred by enhancing ABCA1 stability at both mRNA and protein levels. Although ERK1/2 inhibitor-induced ABCA1 expression was independent of LXR activation, ERK1/2 inhibitor, and LXR ligand synergistically induced macrophage cholesterol efflux and ABCA1 expression. Our studies reported herein describe a new function for ERK1/2 in cholesterol trafficking processes. Inhibitors for different kinases were purchased from CalBiochemistry (San Diego, CA). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich except as indicated. Rabbit anti-ABCA1 polyclonal antibody was obtained from Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO). Rabbit anti-total ERK1/2 and phospho-ERK1/2 polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Rabbit anti-LXRα and LXRβ polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Acetylated low density lipoprotein, HDL, and apoAI were prepared as described (24.Zhou X. He W. Huang Z. Gotto Jr., A.M. Hajjar D.P. Han J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 2129-2138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 30.Brinton E.A. Eisenberg S. Breslow J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 262-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The SDS-PAGE analysis indicated that the prepared HDL did not contain apoE. RAW cells, a murine macrophage cell line, were purchased from ATCC (Rockville, MD) and cultured in complete RPMI medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 50 μg/ml of penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. At ∼90% confluence, cells were switched to serum-free medium and received treatment. To collect peritoneal macrophages, C57 wild-type mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were injected with 3 ml of 4% thioglycolate and maintained with access to water and normal chow for 5 days. Peritoneal macrophages were collected from the mouse abdomen by lavage with PBS. Cells were cultured in complete RPMI medium for 3 h, and all floating cells were removed. Adhesive cells were continued to be cultured with complete RPMI medium for additional 2 days and then treated as indicated. Macrophages in 12-well plates were labeled in macrophage serum-free medium (Invitrogen, 1.5 ml/well) containing 50 μg/ml acetylated low density lipoprotein (used as the carrier for free cholesterol labeling) and 150 nCi/ml [3H]cholesterol for 24 h. After treatment, cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated for 1 h in serum-free medium, then switched to serum-free medium or medium containing purified apoAI (10 μg/ml) or HDL (15 μg/well). After 5-h incubation at 37 °C, medium from each well was collected for determination of radioactivity in supernatants. The remaining cells were lysed by addition of 0.2 n NaOH, and the lysate was determined for protein content which was used to normalize cholesterol efflux (dpm/μg of protein). Total cellular RNA was extracted from cells in 60-mm dishes and used to determine expression of ABCA1 mRNA by Northern blot and quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR. The Northern blot was performed as described previously (31.Han J. Hajjar D.P. Zhou X. Gotto Jr., A.M. Nicholson A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23582-23586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and the probe for mouse ABCA1 mRNA was generated by reverse transcription-PCR with the following primers: forward, 5′-TGGACATCCTGAAGCCAG-3′, and backward, 5′-TTCTTCCCACATGCCCT-3′. To quantitative analyze ABCA1 transcript, 1 μg of total RNA was used to synthesize the first strand DNA with oligo(dT)18. The real-time PCR was performed by using SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and the following primers. Abca1: forward, 5′-CTCAGTTAAGGCTGCTGCTG-3′; backward, 5′-TCAGGCGTACAGAGATCAGG-3′; Gapdh: forward, 5′-ACAACTTTGGCATTGTGGAA-3′; backward, 5′-GATGCAGGGATGATGTTCTG-3′. The quantitative results for ABCA1 were normalized by the levels of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA. Whole cellular proteins were extracted as follows: after treatment cells were washed twice with cold PBS, then scraped and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 μg/ml aprotinin/leupeptin). Lysate was sonicated for 20 cycles, then microcentrifuged for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to a new test tube and stored at −20 °C. Nuclear proteins were extracted as described (32.Zerivitz K. Akusjärvi G. Gene Anal. Tech. 1989; 6: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, cells were firstly suspended in cold buffer A (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 50 μg/ml aprotinin/leupeptin) and incubated on ice for 20 min followed by centrifugation for 5 min with a Microfuge (Beckman) at 3,000 rpm and 4 °C. The resultant pellet of nuclei was washed once with buffer A and then buffer B (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 50 μg/ml aprotinin/leupeptin). The nucleic pellet was re-suspended in buffer C (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 50 μg/ml aprotinin/leupeptin) and incubated on ice for 1 h with vortex several times. The suspension was centrifuged for 30 min at 14,000 rpm and 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and stored at −20 °C. After the content was determined by Lowry method, whole cellular or nuclear proteins were loaded and separated on a 7% (for determination of ABCA1) or 12% (for determination of the rest proteins) SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto nylon enhanced nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with a solution of 0.1% Tween 20/PBS (PBS-T) containing 5% fat-free milk for 1 h, then incubated with primary antibody for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C followed by washing for 3 × 10 min with PBS-T buffer. The blot was re-blocked with PBS-T containing 5% milk followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG for 1 h at room temperature. After washing 3 × 10 min with PBS-T, the membrane was incubated for 1 min in a mixture of equal volumes of Western blot chemiluminescence reagents 1 and 2 and then exposed to film before development. After treatment, macrophages were scraped and washed twice with PBS containing 1% fetal calf serum. Approximately 1 × 106 cells from each sample were blocked for 30 min at room temperature with PBS containing 5% goat serum. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated with rabbit anti-ABCA1 antibody (1:100) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then incubated with goat anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated IgG (1:50) for 45 min at room temperature. After washing with PBS, cells were subjected to flow cytometric evaluation. To determine the binding of apoAI to macrophages, purified apoAI was fluorescein-conjugated with a reactive succinimidyl ester of carboxyl fluorescein by using a labeling kit from Princeton Separations (Adelphia, NJ). After lift, cells were washed twice with PBS and then incubated with 10 μg/ml of labeled apoAI in serum-free medium for 2 h at 37 °C. After washed twice with PBS, cells were used to determine the binding of apoAI by FACS. cDNA encoding nuclear form of mouse SREBP1a (N-terminal 1–460 amino acids) was generated by PCR using the clone purchased from Invitrogen (cDNA clone MGC:66503 IMAGE:6824948) as template DNA and following primers: forward, 5′-ACTCAGATCTCGATGGACGAGCTGGCCTTCG-3′; backward, 5′-CCGCGGTACCCTAGACCTGGCTATCCTCAAAGG-3′. After sequence was confirmed, the PCR product was digested with BglII and KpnI followed by subcloning into an expression vector, pEGFP-C2 (pEGFP-nSREBP1a). Mouse ABCA1 promoters were constructed by PCR with mouse genomic DNA and following primers. For ABCA1 promoter A (from −179 to +227): forward, 5′-TAGCCTCGAGGTCGCCGGTTTAAGGGGCG-3′; backward, 5′-TGCCAAGCTTCCTCTTACCTGTTTTCCACTTTG-3′; for ABCA1 promoter B (from −113 to +227): forward, 5′-TAGCCTCGAGCAGAGGCCGGGAACGGGGCG-3′, and backward was same as in promoter A. After sequence was confirmed, the PCR product was digested by XhoI and HindIII followed by ligation with pGL4 luciferase reporter vector (Promega, Madison, WI), transformed, and amplified. To analyze ABCA1 promoter activity, ∼95% confluent 293 cells in 24-well plates were transfected with DNA for ABCA1 promoter, nSREBP1a and Renilla (for internal normalization) by using LipofectamineTM 2000 (Invitrogen). After 24 h of transfection plus treatment, cells were lysed, and cellular lysate was used to determine the activity of firefly and Renilla luciferases by using the Dual-Luciferase® Reporter Assay System from Promega. The siRNA against mouse ERK1 and ERK2, and the scrambled siRNA were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. RAW cells (∼80% confluence) in a 6-well plate were transfected with siRNA of ERK1 and ERK2 (an equal amount of each was mixed), and scrambled siRNA using TransIT-TKO transfection kit from Mirusbio (Madison, WI). After 24-h transfection, total protein was extracted from cells, and we then assessed total ERK1/2 and ABCA1 protein levels by Western blot. All experiments were repeated at least three times, and representative results are presented. Data generated from the free cholesterol efflux, the activity of ABCA1 promoters, and the real-time PCR were analyzed by paired t test (n = 4). To investigate if the inhibition of a kinase affects macrophage free cholesterol efflux, cells were pre-labeled with [3H]cholesterol and separately received treatment with inhibitors for various kinases. Cells were also treated with an LXR ligand, T0901317, as a positive control. After overnight treatment free cholesterol efflux from macrophages to apoAI in response to these reagents was determined (Fig. 1A). Inhibition of ERK1/2 by PD98059 (40 μm, IC50 values were 4 and 50 μm for ERK1 and ERK2, respectively) induced free cholesterol efflux to apoAI at a comparable level as an LXR ligand (∼4-fold). Another inhibitor of ERK1/2, U0126 (2 μm, IC50 values were 72 and 58 nm for ERK1 and ERK2, respectively) also markedly increased macrophage free cholesterol efflux (∼3-fold). In contrast, inhibition of other kinases, such as protein kinase C by calphostin C (1 μm, IC50 50 nm), protein kinase A (PKA) by myristoylated PKA inhibitor amide 14–22 (1 μm, IC50 50 nm), p38 α, β, and δ MAPKs (p38 MAPK) by SB203580 (1 μm, IC50 34 nm), and c-Jun N-teminal kinases (JNKs) by JNK inhibitor II (2 μm; IC50 values were 40 and 90 nm for JNK-1/2 and JNK-3, respectively) did not influence macrophage free cholesterol efflux to apoAI. Therefore, enhancement of macrophage cholesterol efflux to apoAI appears to be ERK1/2 inhibition-selective. In addition to apoAI, HDL also functions as an acceptor for ABCA1- mediated cholesterol efflux. To determine if the inhibition of ERK1/2 increases free cholesterol efflux to HDL, pre-labeled macrophages received the same treatment as in Fig. 1A overnight followed by assessment of macrophage free cholesterol efflux to HDL. The similar observations obtained for apoAI showed that inhibition of ERK1/2, but not of other kinases, increased macrophage cholesterol efflux to HDL (Fig. 1B). To further determine the effects of ERK1/2 activity on macrophage cholesterol efflux, pre-labeled cells were treated with EGF to increase ERK1/2 activity followed by assessment of cholesterol efflux to apoAI (Fig. 1C). In contrast to the inhibition, the activation of ERK1/2 by EGF significantly suppressed the macrophage free cholesterol efflux. Taken together, results in these experiments (Fig. 1, A–C) suggest that ERK1/2 activity can affect macrophage cholesterol efflux processes. ABCA1 is an important molecule regulating cellular free cholesterol efflux to apoAI and HDL. To determine if ERK1/2 inhibitor-induced macrophage free cholesterol efflux is due to increased ABCA1 levels, cells were treated with different kinase inhibitors. Changes in ABCA1 mRNA in response to these reagents were assessed by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR. Consistent with the effects on cholesterol efflux, ERK1/2 inhibitors (PD98059 and U0126) increased ABCA1 mRNA levels. In contrast, inhibition of PKA, protein kinase C, p38 MAPK, and JNKs had little effect on ABCA1 mRNA levels (Fig. 2A). To study if the increased macrophage ABCA1 mRNA levels by ERK1/2 inhibitors can lead to an increase in cell surface ABCA1 protein, after treatment cells were determined for surface ABCA1 protein levels by FACS (Fig. 2B). Clearly, inhibition of ERK1/2 by PD98059 and U0126 elevated cell surface ABCA1 protein levels. However, inhibition of other kinases had no effect on cell surface ABCA1 protein levels. Associated with the changes in cell surface ABCA1 protein, the binding of apoAI to cells, which is the initial step in ABCA1-mediated free cholesterol efflux, was also selectively increased by ERK1/2 inhibitors, but not by inhibitors for other kinases (Fig. 2C). In contrast to inhibition of ERK1/2, activation of ERK1/2 by EGF reduced macrophage ABCA1 protein levels in a concentration-dependent manner suggesting the reduced macrophage cholesterol efflux by EGF is, at least partially, attributed to the EGF-inhibited ABCA1 expression (Fig. 2D). To study the physiological relevance of ERK1/2 inhibitors on macrophage ABCA1 expression and whether the induction of macrophage ABCA1 expression is dependent on the concentration of ERK1/2 inhibitors, we isolated peritoneal macrophages from wild-type mice and treated them with PD98059 and U0126. Results in Fig. 3A show that both PD98059 and U0126 increased peritoneal macrophage ABCA1 expression. The inductive effect of ERK1/2 inhibitor on ABCA1 expression is semi-concentration-dependent. The maximal induction values of primary macrophage ABCA1 expression by PD98059 and U0126 were 20 and 2 μm, respectively (Fig. 3A). To further confirm the effect of ERK1/2 inhibition on macrophage ABCA1 expression, cells were transfected with siRNA against ERK1 and ERK2. Results in Fig. 3B indicated that the reduced ERK1/2 protein expression by siRNA increased ABCA1 protein expression. In addition, the study with ERK1/2 inhibitor concentrations demonstrated that the increase in macrophage cholesterol efflux was concentration-dependent (Fig. 3C). To study the dynamic effects of ERK1/2 inhibitors on cholesterol efflux, we studied efflux by incubating cells in medium containing apoAI for different time periods"

Viruses have exploited the sumoylation pathway to advance their own replication by evolving several ways to perturb the host sumoylation apparatus. However, there has been no report of virally encoded enzymes directly involved in catalyzing the sumoylation reaction. Here, we report that the K-bZIP protein encoded by Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a SUMO E3 ligase with specificity toward SUMO2/3. K-bZIP is a nuclear factor that functions to modulate viral gene expression and to prolong the G1 phase, allowing viral transcription and translation to proceed at the early stage of infection. In addition to functioning as a transcriptional factor, we show that K-bZIP carries a SIM (SUMO-interacting motif), which specifically binds to SUMO-2/3 but not SUMO-1. K-bZIP catalyzes its own SUMO modification as well as that of its interacting partners such as the cellular tumor suppressor proteins p53 and Rb, both in vitro and in vivo.

IntroductionIncreasing evidence indicates that sumoylation, i.e. post-translational modification of proteins by the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) 2The abbreviations used are: SUMOsmall ubiquitin-like modifierKSHVKaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirusIEimmediate-earlywtwild typeGSTglutathione S-transferasePBSphosphate-buffered salineHAhemagglutininSIMSUMO-interacting motifTCLtotal cell lysate. plays a central role in cellular signal transduction. Like phosphorylation, sumoylation is rapid and reversible. In a manner similar to the binding of phosphorylated tyrosine by signal molecules carrying Src homology 2 (SH2) and phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domains, sumoylated proteins are specifically engaged by proteins with a SUMO-interacting motif (SIM). Modulation of sumoylation has a profound effect on protein-protein interactions and the propagation of cellular signals. Viruses have evolved different mechanisms to exploit the host sumoylation pathway to create a cellular environment that is favorable for viral replication by modulating the functions of viral and cellular proteins (reviewed in Ref. 1.Wilson V.G. Rangasamy D. Virus Res. 2001; 81: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Many viral proteins are themselves sumoylated, and this post-translational modification affects specific functions of these targets. For DNA tumor viruses, the immediate-early and early gene products, which include transcriptional factors, are often sumoylated. Examples include immediate-early 1 (IE 1) and immediate-early 2 (IE 2) proteins of cytomegalovirus (CMV) (2.Müller S. Dejean A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5137-5143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Hofmann H. Flöss S. Stamminger T. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2510-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), E1 and E2 of human papillomavirus (HPV) (4.Rosas-Acosta G. Langereis M.A. Deyrieux A. Wilson V.G. Virology. 2005; 331: 190-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 5.Wu Y.C. Deyrieux A.F. Wilson V.G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2007; 35: 1433-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), BZLF1 of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (6.Adamson A.L. Kenney S. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2388-2399Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), and K-bZIP of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) (7.Izumiya Y. Ellison T.J. Yeh E.T. Jung J.U. Luciw P.A. Kung H.J. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 9912-9925Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Some viral proteins indirectly modulate the sumoylation status of specific cellular proteins. For example, the HPV E7 protein and adenovirus E1A protein block sumoylation of the cellular tumor suppressor Rb (8.Ledl A. Schmidt D. Müller S. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 3810-3818Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Additionally, the KSHV viral protein kinase (ORF36) inhibits the sumoylation of KAP-1 (9.Chang P.C. Fitzgerald L.D. Van Geelen A. Izumiya Y. Ellison T.J. Wang D.H. Ann D.K. Luciw P.A. Kung H.J. Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 5681-5689Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Viruses can also affect global sumoylation of cellular proteins by directly modulating the cellular SUMO machinery. Avian adenovirus Gam1 protein inhibits the SUMO E1-activating enzyme by targeting the SAE1/SAE2 (AOS1/UBA2) heterodimer to cullin RING ligases (CRLs) and promoting SAE1 ubiquitylation and degradation (10.Boggio R. Passafaro A. Chiocca S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 15376-15382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Here, we describe a unique mechanism by which a virus directly modulates sumoylation via the expression of a virally encoded SUMO E3 ligase.Analogous to ubiquitylation, conjugation of SUMO to target proteins is a multistep process involving an E1-activating enzyme heterodimer SAE1/SAE2, an E2-conjugating enzyme Ubc9 (ubiquitin-like protein SUMO-1-conjugating enzyme 9), and an E3 ligase, which is believed to provide specificity for the sumoylation pathway (11.Geiss-Friedlander R. Melchior F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 947-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (1333) Google Scholar). In stark contrast to ubiquitin E3 ligases, which number in the hundreds to thousands, there are very few cellular SUMO E3 ligases. These include the PIAS (protein inhibitor of activated STATS) family (12.Bischof O. Schwamborn K. Martin N. Werner A. Sustmann C. Grosschedl R. Dejean A. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 783-794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 13.Kahyo T. Nishida T. Yasuda H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 713-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), the RanBP2 (Ran-binding protein 2) family (14.Pichler A. Gast A. Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Melchior F. Cell. 2002; 108: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar), and the Pc2 (polycomb 2) family (15.Kagey M.H. Melhuish T.A. Wotton D. Cell. 2003; 113: 127-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). These ligases share the common properties of binding to 1) the SUMO moiety via their SIM domains, 2) Ubc9, the E2 conjugating enzyme, and 3) substrates to which SUMO is subsequently covalently attached. The ability of these ligases to catalyze the sumoylation reaction is demonstrated by reconstituted in vitro sumoylation reactions using purified proteins, including the enzymes, E1, E2, and E3, substrate target proteins, and SUMO proteins. PIAS family members contain a RING domain commonly found in ubiquitin ligases, whereas RanBP2 and Pc2 do not share this feature. Although expression of certain viral proteins has been associated with sumoylation of cellular proteins in vivo, a clear demonstration of a viral protein with SUMO E3 ligase activity has not previously been reported.KSHV, a gamma herpesvirus, is the causative agent for Kaposi's sarcoma as well as primary effusion lymphoma and multicentric Castleman's disease (16.Chang Y. Cesarman E. Pessin M.S. Lee F. Culpepper J. Knowles D.M. Moore P.S. Science. 1994; 266: 1865-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (4926) Google Scholar, 17.Dupin N. Fisher C. Kellam P. Ariad S. Tulliez M.

This virus encodes two major transcriptional factors, K-Rta and K-bZIP (KSHV basic-leucine-zipper). K-Rta is a strong transactivator and a trigger of lytic replication (18.Lukac D.M. Garibyan L. Kirshner J.R. Palmeri D. Ganem D. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 6786-6799Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 19.Sun R. Lin S.F. Gradoville L. Yuan Y. Zhu F. Miller G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 10866-10871Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar), whereas K-bZIP is a strong transcriptional repressor that attenuates the activity of K-Rta (20.Izumiya Y. Lin S.F. Ellison T. Chen L.Y. Izumiya C. Luciw P. Kung H.J. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 1441-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We previously reported that K-bZIP is highly sumoylated at a single lysine residue (Lys-158) and that its repressive activity depends on sumoylation (7.Izumiya Y. Ellison T.J. Yeh E.T. Jung J.U. Luciw P.A. Kung H.J. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 9912-9925Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 21.Izumiya Y. Izumiya C. Van Geelen A. Wang D.H. Lam K.S. Luciw P.A. Kung H.J. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 1072-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Upon phosphorylation of K-bZIP at Thr-111 by either the cell cycle protein CDK2 or the viral protein kinase (ORF36), the sumoylation of K-bZIP is inhibited; thus, phosphorylation converts K-bZIP from functioning as a transcriptional repressor to a transactivator (21.Izumiya Y. Izumiya C. Van Geelen A. Wang D.H. Lam K.S. Luciw P.A. Kung H.J. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 1072-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). K-bZIP is a nuclear protein distributed in the nucleoplasm as well as in PML bodies (7.Izumiya Y. Ellison T.J. Yeh E.T. Jung J.U. Luciw P.A. Kung H.J. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 9912-9925Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This viral protein has multiple interacting partners, including the cellular tumor suppressor p53 (22.Park J. Seo T. Hwang S. Lee D. Gwack Y. Choe J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 11977-11982Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 23.Yamanegi K. Tang S. Zheng Z.M. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 14207-14221Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and is a modulator of p53 and its recruitment to PML bodies (24.Katano H. Ogawa-Goto K. Hasegawa H. Kurata T. Sata T. Virology. 2001; 286: 446-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The latter process is likely to be SUMO-related because PML bodies are storage sites for sumoylated proteins (25.Shen T.H. Lin H.K. Scaglioni P.P. Yung T.M. Pandolfi P.P. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 331-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Sumoylation of most transcriptional factors results in a reduction of their transactivation activities. However, p53 is a rare exception, because sumoylation increases its transcriptional activity on target promoters (26.Gostissa M. Hengstermann A. Fogal V. Sandy P. Schwarz S.E. Scheffner M. Del Sal G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6462-6471Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 27.Rodriguez M.S. Desterro J.M. Lain S. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Hay R.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6455-6461Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). In addition to its activity as a transcriptional factor, K-bZIP plays a role in viral genome replication (28.AuCoin D.P. Colletti K.S. Cei S.A. Papousková I. Tarrant M. Pari G.S. Virology. 2004; 318: 542-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and G1 cell cycle arrest (29.Wu F.Y. Tang Q.Q. Chen H. ApRhys C. Farrell C. Chen J. Fujimuro M. Lane M.D. Hayward G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 10683-10688Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 30.Izumiya Y. Lin S.F. Ellison T.J. Levy A.M. Mayeur G.L. Izumiya C. Kung H.J. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 9652-9661Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 31.Wu F.Y. Wang S.E. Tang Q.Q. Fujimuro M. Chiou C.J. Zheng Q. Chen H. Hayward S.D. Lane M.D. Hayward G.S. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 8893-8914Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that these activities of K-bZIP, taken together, provide a cellular environment conducive for the expression of viral early genes (reviewed in Ref. 32.Flemington E.K. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4475-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar).In this study, using purified components required for SUMO modification, we provide evidence that K-bZIP is a SIM-containing poly-SUMO-specific E3 ligase. Overexpression of K- bZIP increased global sumoylation of cellular proteins in a SUMO-2/3- and SIM-dependent manner. Enhancement of the sumoylation of p53 by K-bZIP was accompanied by the recruitment of K-bZIP to p53 target promoters, and an increase in SUMO-2/3 content at these promoters. Cumulatively, these events lead to an increase of p21, providing an additional mechanism whereby K-bZIP expression prolongs the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Perhaps the most significant finding of this study is the first demonstration of a viral protein, which functions as a SUMO-2/3 E3 ligase.DISCUSSIONA large body of evidence supports a role for sumoylation in replication of many viruses. This post-translational modification modulates subcellular localization, transcriptional activity, stability and ability to interact with other proteins (40.Huh Y.H. Kim Y.E. Kim E.T. Park J.J. Song M.J. Zhu H. Hayward G.S. Ahn J.H. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 10444-10454Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 41.Wu Y.C. Bian X.L. Heaton P.R. Deyrieux A.F. Wilson V.G. Virology. 2009; 387: 176-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). A handful of viruses have evolved means to directly regulate the host SUMO machinery. For example, avian adenovirus Gam1 interacts with and inhibits SUMO E1 activity (42.Boggio R. Colombo R. Hay R.T. Draetta G.F. Chiocca S. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 549-561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), Ebola Zaire virus VP35 interacts with SUMO E2 Ubc9 and E3 PIAS to stimulate their activity (43.Chang T.H. Kubota T. Matsuoka M. Jones S. Bradfute S.B. Bray M. Ozato K. PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5: e1000493Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), and herpes simplex virus ICP0 co-localizes SENP1 de-sumoylase with PML (44.Bailey D. O'Hare P. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 2951-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thus these viral proteins are likely to produce a global effect on the host SUMO status during viral replication. In this report, we show for the first time that a virus encodes a SUMO E3 ligase.A SUMO ligase is defined by its ability to 1) bind Ubc9, SUMO, and a substrate, and 2) catalyze the sumoylation of the substrate both in vivo and in vitro. Previously, we showed that K-bZIP associates with Ubc9 (7.Izumiya Y. Ellison T.J. Yeh E.T. Jung J.U. Luciw P.A. Kung H.J. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 9912-9925Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Here, we have demonstrated that K-bZIP contains a SIM, which binds SUMO-2 and SUMO-3, but not SUMO-1, both in vitro and in vivo. SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 are highly homologous (97% identity in the mature form), whereas SUMO-1 is more distantly related (48% identity to SUMO-2, and 46% to SUMO-3). SUMO-2 and -3 can form poly-chain structures, whereas SUMO-1 is usually added in monomeric form. SUMO-1 is found in nucleoli, nuclear envelopes, and cytoplasmic foci, whereas SUMO-2/3 are associated with chromatin. As such, these proteins are likely to convey different signals and exert distinct functions. All previously characterized cellular SUMO E3 ligases, such as RanBP2, PIAS, and Pc2, bind all three SUMO paralogues non-discriminatorily. K-bZIP, on the other hand, appears to be highly selective toward SUMO-2/3. MCAF-1, which has an identical core SIM motif (VIDLT) as K-bZIP, also shows selectivity toward SUMO-2/3 (36.Sekiyama N. Ikegami T. Yamane T. Ikeguchi M. Uchimura Y. Baba D. Ariyoshi M. Tochio H. Saitoh H. Shirakawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 35966-35975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 45.Hecker C.M. Rabiller M. Haglund K. Bayer P. Dikic I. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16117-16127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). The KD for K-bZIP SIM/SUMO-2/3 (∼0.2 μm) is 10-fold less than that of K-bZIP SIM/SUMO-1 (∼2 μm). This measure is comparable to the 1.3 μmKD value reported for MCAF-1 SIM/SUMO-2/3 and 14 μm for MCAF-1 SIM/SUMO-1 interaction (36.Sekiyama N. Ikegami T. Yamane T. Ikeguchi M. Uchimura Y. Baba D. Ariyoshi M. Tochio H. Saitoh H. Shirakawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 35966-35975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Likewise, USP25, a ubiquitin-specific protease which selectively binds SUMO-2/3 possesses a TNVIDLT motif (Fig. 1B) (46.Meulmeester E. Kunze M. Hsiao H.H. Urlaub H. Melchior F. Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 610-619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), and these seven amino acids are sufficient to confer the selectivity toward SUMO-2/3. These data are in good agreement with our finding. On the other hand, PIASxa which carries the core VIDLT motif is known to display E3 ligase activity for all three paralogues. Thus, the preference toward SUMO-2/3 is also influenced by the surrounding amino acid sequences. Further structural studies are required to resolve these issues.To demonstrate that K-bZIP functions as an E3 ligase, the ability of this viral protein to catalyze sumoylation was demonstrated in cell-free reconstituted sumoylation reactions. We showed that p53 and Rb, two K-bZIP-interacting proteins, are sumoylated in the presence of K-bZIP, and further, that the conjugation depended on an intact SIM domain of K-bZIP with a preference for SUMO-2/3 modification. The increased sumoylation of p53 was also shown in TREx-F-K-bZIP inducible cells in a SIM domain-dependent manner. This increased sumoylation is supported by heightened transactivation activity of p53 toward a reporter gene driven by p53-responsive element mediated by wild-type K-bZIP, but not the SIM mutant. Our data are consistent with earlier work showing that sumoylated p53 is more transcriptionally active (26.Gostissa M. Hengstermann A. Fogal V. Sandy P. Schwarz S.E. Scheffner M. Del Sal G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6462-6471Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 27.Rodriguez M.S. Desterro J.M. Lain S. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Hay R.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6455-6461Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar) and that K-bZIP is able to enhance the transactivation activity of p53 (23.Yamanegi K. Tang S. Zheng Z.M. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 14207-14221Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In this regard, a recent report by Li et al. (39.Li T. Santockyte R. Shen R.F. Tekle E. Wang G. Yang D.C. Chock P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36221-36227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) showed that expression of SUMO-2/3, but not SUMO-1, induces p53 activity with consequent cellular senescence, and that treatment of cells with H2O2 induced SUMO-2/3, but not SUMO-1, resulting in p53-mediated growth arrest. Growth arrest is a common outcome associated with the early phase of herpesvirus infection (reviewed in Ref. 32.Flemington E.K. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4475-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and provides an optimal environment for the virus to transcribe and translate viral RNA before the onset of viral DNA replication. At the same time, this viral-mediated growth arrest protects host cells from undergoing apoptosis. For KSHV, K-bZIP performs similar functions (29.Wu F.Y. Tang Q.Q. Chen H. ApRhys C. Farrell C. Chen J. Fujimuro M. Lane M.D. Hayward G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 10683-10688Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 30.Izumiya Y. Lin S.F. Ellison T.J. Levy A.M. Mayeur G.L. Izumiya C. Kung H.J. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 9652-9661Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 31.Wu F.Y. Wang S.E. Tang Q.Q. Fujimuro M. Chiou C.J. Zheng Q. Chen H. Hayward S.D. Lane M.D. Hayward G.S. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 8893-8914Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Previously, we have shown that K-bZIP expression induced growth arrest via the inactivation of CDK2 (30.Izumiya Y. Lin S.F. Ellison T.J. Levy A.M. Mayeur G.L. Izumiya C. Kung H.J. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 9652-9661Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Here we provide an additional possible mechanism by which K-bZIP induces growth arrest, i.e. by activating p53 pathway via sumoylation of this cell regulatory protein. Many p53 target genes are induced by K-bZIP in a SUMO-dependent manner. Perhaps the most striking finding is that K-bZIP is recruited to p53 target sites in a SIM-dependent manner, suggesting that the SUMO-rich environment stabilizes the complex between p53 and K-bZIP, and the K-bZIP presence ensures the sumoylated status of p53.Why does KSHV encode a SUMO-2/3 E3 ligase? Dynamic sumoylation of host and viral proteins is thought to play an important role in herpesvirus replication. The assembly and disassembly of PML bodies (or ND10) at herpesvirus replication complexes are SUMO-dependent (47.Boggio R. Chiocca S. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2006; 9: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Condensation of viral chromatin to achieve a latent, heterochromatin state is likely to be facilitated by sumoylation (48.Uchimura Y. Ichimura T. Uwada J. Tachibana T. Sugahara S. Nakao M. Saitoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23180-23190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and the reverse is true for reactivation. Exploitation of the SUMO pathway for viral replication may be especially important for KSHV, because this virus encodes not only a SUMO ligase (K-bZIP, as reported here) but also a SUMO-dependent ubiquitin ligase, K-Rta, which degrades SUMO and sumoylated proteins. 3Y. Izumiya, C. Izumiya, M. Pochampalli, M. Campbell, P. A. Luciw, and H.-J. Kung, data to be published. Overexpression of K-Rta leads to disassembly of PML bodies and reactivation of the latent genome, presumably by providing a SUMO-depleted environment. We showed previously that K-bZIP is an interacting partner and a modulator of K-Rta, thus counter-balancing the transactivation activity of K-Rta (20.Izumiya Y. Lin S.F. Ellison T. Chen L.Y. Izumiya C. Luciw P. Kung H.J. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 1441-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Moreover, during viral replication, depending on the relative levels of K-Rta and K-bZIP, the abundance of SUMO-2/3 and SUMO-conjugated proteins might be modulated, thereby allowing the viral replication to proceed or in some cases, enabling viral latency to be established. Another intriguing role of K-bZIP, as a modulator of gene expression, might well be to facilitate the degradation functions of K-Rta, by “marking” the proteins to be targeted with SUMO-2/3 conjugation. The latter scenario is supported by a recent report showing that KSHV LANA2 increases PML sumoylation and facilitates its degradation by a cellular ligase (49.Marcos-Villar L. Lopitz-Otsoa F. Gallego P. Muñoz-Fontela C. González-Santamaria J. Campagna M. Shou-Jiang G. Rodriguez M.S. Rivas C. J. Virol. 2009; 83: 8849-8858Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Additional studies are required to understand the critical regulatory interplay between these two major KSHV factors, the K-bZIP repressor and the K-Rta transactivator.In summary, we report the discovery of K-bZIP as the first viral SUMO-2/3 E3 ligase, which critically depends on an intact SIM for its enzymatic function. We also demonstrate its ability to catalyze the sumoylation and modulate the transactivation of p53, which, in turn, modulates the assembly of a sumoylated complex near p53 transcriptional target sites, all in a SIM-dependent manner. IntroductionIncreasing evidence indicates that sumoylation, i.e. post-translational modification of proteins by the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) 2The abbreviations used are: SUMOsmall ubiquitin-like modifierKSHVKaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirusIEimmediate-earlywtwild typeGSTglutathione S-transferasePBSphosphate-buffered salineHAhemagglutininSIMSUMO-interacting motifTCLtotal cell lysate. plays a central role in cellular signal transduction. Like phosphorylation, sumoylation is rapid and reversible. In a manner similar to the binding of phosphorylated tyrosine by signal molecules carrying Src homology 2 (SH2) and phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domains, sumoylated proteins are specifically engaged by proteins with a SUMO-interacting motif (SIM). Modulation of sumoylation has a profound effect on protein-protein interactions and the propagation of cellular signals. Viruses have evolved different mechanisms to exploit the host sumoylation pathway to create a cellular environment that is favorable for viral replication by modulating the functions of viral and cellular proteins (reviewed in Ref. 1.Wilson V.G. Rangasamy D. Virus Res. 2001; 81: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Many viral proteins are themselves sumoylated, and this post-translational modification affects specific functions of these targets. For DNA tumor viruses, the immediate-early and early gene products, which include transcriptional factors, are often sumoylated. Examples include immediate-early 1 (IE 1) and immediate-early 2 (IE 2) proteins of cytomegalovirus (CMV) (2.Müller S. Dejean A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5137-5143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Hofmann H. Flöss S. Stamminger T. J.

Virol. 2001; 75: 2388-2399Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), and K-bZIP of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) (7.Izumiya Y. Ellison T.J. Yeh E.T. Jung J.U. Luciw P.A. Kung H.J. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 9912-9925Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Some viral proteins indirectly modulate the sumoylation status of specific cellular proteins. For example, the HPV E7 protein and adenovirus E1A protein block sumoylation of the cellular tumor suppressor Rb (8.Ledl A. Schmidt D. Müller S. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 3810-3818Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Additionally, the KSHV viral protein kinase (ORF36) inhibits the sumoylation of KAP-1 (9.Chang P.C. Fitzgerald L.D. Van Geelen A. Izumiya Y. Ellison T.J. Wang D.H. Ann D.K. Luciw P.A. Kung H.J. Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 5681-5689Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Viruses can also affect global sumoylation of cellular proteins by directly modulating the cellular SUMO machinery. Avian adenovirus Gam1 protein inhibits the SUMO E1-activating enzyme by targeting the SAE1/SAE2 (AOS1/UBA2) heterodimer to cullin RING ligases (CRLs) and promoting SAE1 ubiquitylation and degradation (10.Boggio R. Passafaro A. Chiocca S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 15376-15382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Here, we describe a unique mechanism by which a virus directly modulates sumoylation via the expression of a virally encoded SUMO E3 ligase.Analogous to ubiquitylation, conjugation of SUMO to target proteins is a multistep process involving an E1-activating enzyme heterodimer SAE1/SAE2, an E2-conjugating enzyme Ubc9 (ubiquitin-like protein SUMO-1-conjugating enzyme 9), and an E3 ligase, which is believed to provide specificity for the sumoylation pathway (11.Geiss-Friedlander R. Melchior F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 947-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (1333) Google Scholar). In stark contrast to ubiquitin E3 ligases, which number in the hundreds to thousands, there are very few cellular SUMO E3 ligases. These include the PIAS (protein inhibitor of activated STATS) family (12.Bischof O. Schwamborn K. Martin N. Werner A. Sustmann C. Grosschedl R. Dejean A. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 783-794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 13.Kahyo T. Nishida T. Yasuda H. Mol.

Cell. 2003; 113: 127-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). These ligases share the common properties of binding to 1) the SUMO moiety via their SIM domains, 2) Ubc9, the E2 conjugating enzyme, and 3) substrates to which SUMO is subsequently covalently attached. The ability of these ligases to catalyze the sumoylation reaction is demonstrated by reconstituted in vitro sumoylation reactions using purified proteins, including the enzymes, E1, E2, and E3, substrate target proteins, and SUMO protei"

Here, we show that T0901317 produces massive hypertriglyceridemia when given to mice lacking low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors (Ldlr−/− mice). Triglycerides ranged from 4000 to 6000 mg/dl, and the plasma turned milky. The median diameter of VLDL particles, measured by electron microscopy, increased from 43 to 112 nm, 87% exceeding 80 nm, the size of chylomicrons. Hypertriglyceridemia was prevented in Ldlr−/− recipient mice that lacked SREBP-1c (Ldlr−/−;Srebp-1c−/− double knock-out mice). In Ldlr−/− mice, T0901317 increased mRNAs not only for enzymes of fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis, but also for phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP), which transfers phospholipids into nascent VLDL, allowing particle expansion. The PLTP increase was blunted in Ldlr−/−;Srebp-1c−/− animals. When Ldlr−/−;Srebp-1c−/− mice received an adenovirus encoding Pltp, the hypertriglyceridemic response to T0901317 was partially restored and the VLDL size increased. We conclude that LXR agonists activate triglyceride synthesis and Pltp transcription by activating Srebp-1c. In concert with the increase in TG synthesis, the increased PLTP permits triglyceride incorporation into abnormally large VLDL, which are removed from plasma by LDL receptors.

https://openalex.org/W2088431330,"Compound A (CpdA), a dissociated glucocorticoid receptor modulator, decreases corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and luteneinizing hormone levels in rats. Whether this is due to transcriptional regulation by CpdA is not known. Using promoter reporter assays we show that CpdA, like dexamethasone (Dex), directly transrepresses these genes. Results using a rat Cbg proximal-promoter reporter construct in BWTG3 and HepG2 cell lines support a glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-dependent transrepression mechanism for CpdA. However, CpdA, unlike Dex, does not result in transactivation via glucocorticoid-responsive elements within a promoter reporter construct even when GR is co-transfected. The inability of CpdA to result in transactivation via glucocorticoid-responsive elements is confirmed on the endogenous tyrosine aminotransferase gene, whereas transrepression ability is confirmed on the endogenous CBG gene. Consistent with a role for CpdA in modulating GR activity, whole cell binding assays revealed that CpdA binds reversibly to the GR, but with lower affinity than Dex, and influences association of [(3)H]Dex, but has no effect on dissociation. In addition, like Dex, CpdA causes nuclear translocation of the GR, albeit to a lesser degree. Several lines of evidence, including fluorescence resonance energy transfer, co-immunoprecipitation, and nuclear immunofluorescence studies of nuclear localization-deficient GR show that CpdA, unlike Dex, does not elicit ligand-induced GR dimerization. Comparison of the behavior of CpdA in the presence of wild type GR to that of Dex with a dimerization-deficient GR mutant (GR(dim)) strongly supports the conclusion that loss of dimerization is responsible for the dissociated behavior of CpdA."

They intimately attach to host intestinal epithelial cells, trigger the effacement of intestinal microvilli, and cause diarrheal disease. Central to their pathogenesis is a type III secretion system (T3SS) encoded by a pathogenicity island called the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE). The T3SS is used to inject both LEE- and non-LEE-encoded effector proteins into the host cell, where these effectors modulate host signaling pathways and immune responses. Identifying the effectors and elucidating their functions are central to understanding the molecular pathogenesis of these pathogens. Here we analyzed the type III secretome of C. rodentium using the highly sensitive and quantitative SILAC (stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture)-based mass spectrometry. This approach not only confirmed nearly all known secreted proteins and effectors previously identified by conventional biochemical and proteomic techniques, but also identified several new secreted proteins. The T3SS-dependent secretion of these new proteins was validated, and five of them were translocated into cultured cells, representing new or additional effectors. Deletion mutants for genes encoding these effectors were generated in C. rodentium and tested in a murine infection model.

These complex protein export apparatus consist of a series of multicomponent, ring-shaped protein structures spanning the bacterial envelope, the extracellular space, and the host plasma membrane. They facilitate the direct delivery of bacterial virulence proteins (effectors) to the interior of the host cell. A key component of the T3SS is the needle complex, comprised of a basal body with multiple rings, an inner rod, and an external, protruding needle (3.Marlovits T.C. Kubori T. Lara-Tejero M. Thomas D. Unger V.M. Galán J.E. Nature. 2006; 441: 637-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar).

A large number of proteins are secreted by T3SSs, although the exact number varies considerably among pathogens. There are at least 4 categories of protein substrates, based on their secretion hierarchy. The needle and inner rod components (early substrates), required for the type III secretion of later substrates, are secreted first via the basal body to complete the assembly of the needle complex (4.Kimbrough T.G. Miller S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 11008-11013Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The needle complex then secretes the translocators (intermediate substrates) and effectors (late substrates). Because the translocators are needed for translocation of the effectors into host cells, they are presumably secreted ahead of the effectors. Some expression- and secretion-regulating proteins are also secreted via the T3SS in certain pathogens (1.Cornelis G.R. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2006; 4: 811-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). Because the effectors play vital roles in mediating infections and diseases by modulating or subverting host immune responses and cellular structures and functions, their identification and function elucidation are critical to our understanding of the pathogenesis mechanisms of these pathogens. The attaching/effacing (A/E) pathogens, including enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), and the mouse pathogen Citrobacter rodentium, use a T3SS encoded by the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE), a chromosomally located pathogenicity island, to colonize the host and cause disease (5.Nataro J.P.

Finlay B.B. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 3310-3319Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) was used for the translocation assay. The bacteria were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth or agar plates. MacConkey agar from OXOID (Hampshire, United Kingdom) was used for plating C. rodentium after in vivo mouse infections. DMEM from HyClone (Logan, UT) was used as the medium for inducing type III secretion. However, custom synthesized l-lysine- and l-arginine-deficient DMEM from Caisson Labs (Logan, UT) was used for analyzing the type III secretome of C. rodentium using SILAC. The mouse monoclonal antibody against the hemagglutinin (HA.11) epitope was purchased from Covance (Emeryville, CA), and mouse antibody against N-terminal His-tagged TEM-1 β-lactamase was from QED Bioscience (San Diego, CA). Primers used in this study are listed in supplemental Table S1. The sacB gene-based allelic exchange method was used to generate lysA and argH double in-frame deletion mutants in C. rodentium strain DBS100 using the suicide vector pRE118 (29.Edwards R.A. Keller L.H. Schifferli D.M. Gene. 1998; 207: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) as previously described (17.Deng W. Puente J.L. Gruenheid S. Li Y. Vallance B.A. Vázquez A. Barba J. Ibarra J.A. O'Donnell P. Metalnikov P. Ashman K. Lee S. Goode D. Pawson T. Finlay B.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 3597-3602Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). We first deleted lysA to generate DBS100ΔlysA. PCR was used to generate two fragments (1.2 and 1.4 kb, respectively) using primer pairs CRlysA-1/CRlysA-DR as well as CRlysA-DF/CRlysA-2 (supplemental Table S1). The PCR products were digested with KpnI/NheI and NheI/SacI, respectively, and cloned into pRE118 digested with KpnI/SacI in a 3-way ligation and transformed into E. coli SY327λpir. The resulting plasmid pRE118-ΔCRlysA contained 1.2 to 1.4 kb of flanking regions on both sides of lysA and the lysA gene with an internal in-frame deletion of about 83%. An NheI site was introduced into the deletion site. Plasmid pRE-ΔCRlysA was introduced into DBS100 by electroporation. After sucrose selection, C. rodentium colonies resistant to sucrose and sensitive to kanamycin were screened and verified for deletion of lysA by multiple PCRs, thus creating DBS100ΔlysA. Similarly, a suicide vector for deleting argH, pRE118-ΔCRargH, was generated using primer pairs CRargH-1/CRargH-DR and CRargH-DF/CRargH-2 (supplemental Table S1). About 85% of argH was deleted. This construct was introduced into DBS100ΔlysA to generate the double mutant ΔlysAΔargH using the same sucrose selection protocol. We subsequently introduced pRE118-ΔCRescN and pRE118-ΔCRsepD (17.Deng W. Puente J.L. Gruenheid S. Li Y. Vallance B.A. Vázquez A. Barba J. Ibarra J.A. O'Donnell P. Metalnikov P. Ashman K. Lee S.

U.S.A. 2004; 101: 3597-3602Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar) into ΔlysAΔargH to generate ΔlysAΔargHΔescN and ΔlysAΔargHΔsepD, respectively. Finally, pRE118-ΔCRescN was introduced into ΔlysAΔargHΔsepD to create ΔlysAΔargHΔsepDΔescN. A schematic diagram of the procedure for analyzing type III-secreted proteins using SILAC (20.Ong S.E. Mann M. Nat. Protocols. 2006; 1: 2650-2660Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar) is shown in Fig. 1A. DBS100 ΔlysAΔargH and ΔlysAΔargHΔescN were paired to identify type III-secreted proteins by “wild-type” (WT) C. rodentium, whereas DBS100 ΔlysAΔargHΔsepD and ΔlysAΔargHΔsepDΔescN were contrasted to identify type III-secreted proteins by the ΔsepD mutant, with all strains carrying plasmid pCRgrlA (17.Deng W. Puente J.L. Gruenheid S. Li Y. Vallance B.A. Vázquez A. Barba J. Ibarra J.A. O'Donnell P. Metalnikov P. Ashman K. Lee S. Goode D. Pawson T. Finlay B.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 3597-3602Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). The strains were grown in l-lysine- and l-arginine-deficient DMEM supplemented with either normal isotopic abundance (“light”) l-lysine and l-arginine for strains ΔlysAΔargHΔescN and ΔlysAΔargHΔsepDΔescN, or “heavy” [2H4]lysine and [13C6]arginine (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Cambridge, MA) for strains ΔlysAΔargH and ΔlysAΔargHΔsepD. The strains were grown in 3 ml of the supplemented DMEM overnight at 37 °C in a shaker at 225 rpm, and then subcultured 1:20 into 12 ml (3 ml per well) of the same, pre-warmed DMEM in a 6-well cell culture plate (Corning Inc.). The plate was incubated in a tissue culture incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C without shaking to induce type III secretion. After 6 h, the cultures for each strain were pooled together, and their optical density at 600 nm was measured. The cultures were centrifuged at 16,100 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant from ΔlysAΔargH was combined with that from ΔlysAΔargHΔescN in a 1:1 ratio normalized according to their A600 readings. The supernatant from ΔlysAΔargHΔsepD and ΔlysAΔargHΔsepDΔescN was pooled similarly. The combined supernatant was filtered through a Millex-GV13 filter unit (0.22 μm, Millipore) to remove any residual bacteria. Trichloroacetic acid was added to a final concentration of 10% to the supernatant to precipitate the proteins. The proteins were pelleted by spinning at 16,100 × g for 30 min in 2-ml Eppendorf SafeLock tubes, washed once with cold acetone, and dried in air. The protein pellet was solubilized in 6 m urea, 2 m thiourea in 10 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), and in-solution tryptic digestions were performed as described (30.Foster L.J. De Hoog C.L. Mann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 5813-5818Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). The samples were next diluted 2-fold with a solution of 1% trifluoroacetic acid, 3% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.5% (v/v) acetic acid, and desalted, concentrated, and filtered on C18 STop And Go Extraction tips (31.Rappsilber J. Ishihama Y. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 2003; 75: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (1833) Google Scholar), and then eluted directly into a 96-well plate. Peptide mixtures were analyzed on a 1100 series nanoflow high performance liquid chromatograph (Agilent) on-line coupled via a nanoelectrospray ion source (Proxeon, Odense, Denmark) to a linear trapping quadrupole-Orbitrap (LTQ-OrbitrapXL, ThermoFisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) tandem mass spectrometer (32.Chan Q.W. Howes C.G. Foster L.J. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2006; 5: 2252-2262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Briefly, peptides were injected directly onto a reversed phase (3 μm-diameter ReproSil-Pur C18, Dr. Maisch, Ammerbuch-Entringen, Germany) column manually packed into a 15 cm-long, 75 μm-inner diameter fused silica emitter. Peptides were eluted directly into the LTQ-OrbitrapXL using a linear gradient from 4.8% acetonitrile in 0.5% acetic acid to 24% acetonitrile in 0.5% acetic acid over 60 min at a flow rate of 200 nl/min. The LTQ-OrbitrapXL was set to acquire a full-range scan in the Orbitrap, from which the 5 most abundant multiply charged ions were selected for fragmentation in the LTQ (32.Chan Q.W. Howes C.G. Foster L.J. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2006; 5: 2252-2262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Peak lists of fragment ions were generated by Extract_MSN (version 3.2, ThermoFisher) using the default parameters. Monoisotopic peak and charge state assignments were checked by DTA Supercharge, part of the MSQuant suite of software (33.Mortensen P. Gouw J.W. Olsen J.V. Ong S.E. Rigbolt K.T. Bunkenborg J. Cox J. Foster L.J. Heck A.J. Blagoev B. Andersen J.S. Mann M. J. Proteome Res. 2010; 9: 393-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Fragment spectra were searched against a data base comprised of normal contaminants (e.g. keratins and albumin) and exogenous additives (e.g. trypsin and immunoglobulins), as well as translations of all open reading frames predicted in all six reading frames of the C. rodentium genome sequence (54,093 sequences, including reversed), using Mascot (version 2.2, Matrix Science) with the following parameters; trypsin specificity allowing up to one missed cleavage, cysteine carbamidomethylation as a fixed modification, [13C6]arginine and [2H4]lysine as appropriate for the particular experiment as variable modifications, ESI-trap fragmentation characteristics, 5-ppm mass tolerance for precursor ion masses, and 0.6 Da tolerance for fragment ion masses. Acceptance criteria for protein identifications were set so that only proteins identified by at least two unique peptides of seven or more amino acids with Mascot IonsScores >25 were accepted, criteria resulting in an estimated false discovery rate of less than 1%. Quantitative ratios were extracted from the raw data using MSQuant (version 1.4.3), which calculates an intensity weighted average of within spectra ratios from all spectra across the chromatographic peak of each peptide ion. For automatic quantification, only those proteins with a coefficient of variation less than 30% were accepted with no further verification. For proteins with high coefficient of variations or with only one quantified peptide in a particular experiment, the chromatographic peak assignment was manually verified or rejected. In the overall study the expression ratios for all proteins reported here were based on quantification of at least two peptides. Analytical variability of SILAC data in the types of experiments performed here is typically <20% in our hands and biological variability was addressed in these experiments by performing at least three independent replicates of each experiment. All peptide and protein information acquired in this study can be found in supplemental Tables S2–S4. C-terminal 2HA fusions were generated using the vector pTOPO-2HA (17.Deng W. Puente J.L. Gruenheid S. Li Y. Vallance B.A. Vázquez A. Barba J. Ibarra J.A. O'Donnell P. Metalnikov P. Ashman K. Lee S. Goode D. Pawson T. Finlay B.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 3597-3602Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). The coding regions with their immediate upstream regions, but without the stop codon, of C. rodentium nleK, ospB, espM2, espT, espX7, and EPEC rorf8 were amplified by PCR using primer pairs CRnleK-HAF/CRnleK-HAR, CRospB-HAF/CRospB-HAR, CRespM2-HAF/CRespM2-HAR, CRespT-HAF/CRespT-HAR, CRespX-HAF/CRespX-HAR, and EPr8-HAF/EPr8-HAR (supplemental Table S1), respectively, and then cloned as either a SacI/XhoI (for nleK, ospB, espM2, espT, and EPEC rorf8) or a KpnI/SalI (for espX7) fragment into SacI/XhoI or KpnI/XhoI-digested pTOPO-2HA. These constructs express fusion proteins with a double HA tag at their C termini. N-terminal translational fusions to TEM-1 β-lactamase were generated in pCX341 (a generous gift from I. Rosenshine, Hebrew University, Israel), a derivative of pCX340 (34.Charpentier X. Oswald E. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5486-5495Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 35.Mills E. Baruch K. Charpentier X. Kobi S. Rosenshine I. Cell Host Microbe. 2008; 3: 104-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The coding regions, without the stop codon, of C. rodentium nleK, ospB, espM2, espT, and espX7, and EPEC espZ and rorf8 were amplified by PCR using primer pairs TEM-CRnleKF/TEM-CRnleKR, TEM-CRospBF/TEM-CRospBR, TEM-CRespM2F/TEM-CRespM2R, TEM-CRespTF/TEM-CRespTR, CRespX-HAF/TEM-CRespXR, TEM-EPespZF/TEM-EPespZR, and TEM-EPr8F/TEM-EPr8R (supplemental Table S1), respectively, and then cloned as either an NdeI/EcoRI (for nleK, ospB, espT, espZ, and rorf8) or a KpnI/EcoRI (for espM2 and espX7) fragment into NdeI/EcoRI- or KpnI/EcoRI-digested pCX341 to generate pCRnleK-TEM, pCRospB-TEM, pCRespM2-TEM, pCRespT-TEM, pCRespX7-TEM, pEPespZ-TEM, and pEPr8-TEM. These constructs were introduced by electroporation into EPEC strain E2348/69 and its ΔescN mutant for translocation assays. Type III secretion assays for C. rodentium proteins were performed essentially as described before for EPEC (36.Zarivach R. Vuckovic M. Deng W. Finlay B.B. Strynadka N.C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Translocation of effectors into host cells was assayed using the TEM-1 β-lactamase translocation assay (34.Charpentier X. Oswald E. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5486-5495Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). EPEC wild-type and its ΔescN strains carrying N-terminal translational fusions to TEM-1 β-lactamase were used to infect HeLa cells (CCL2, American Type Culture Collection), translocation was detected by fluorescence microscopy using the fluorescent substrate CCF2-AM (Invitrogen), and fluorescence was quantified as previously described (34.Charpentier X. Oswald E. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5486-5495Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Using the same vector and sucrose selection procedure as described above for generating lysA and argH mutants, we constructed deletion constructs pRE118-ΔCRnleK, pRE118-ΔCRespM2, pRE118-ΔCRespT, pRE118-ΔCRespX7, and pRE118-ΔCRospB by cloning into pRE118 the PCR fragments generated using primer pairs CRnleK-1/DCRnleK-R and DCRnleK-F/CRnleK-2, CRespM2–1/DCRespM2-R and DCRespM2-F/CRespM2–2, CRespT-1/DCRespT-R and DCRespT-F/CRespT-2, CRespX-1/DCRespX-R and DCRespX-F/ CRespX-2, as well as CRospB-1/DCRospB-R and DCRospB-F/CRospB-2 (supplemental Table S1), respectively. About 87% of the coding region of nleK, 92% of espM2, 92% of espT, 93% of espX7, and 89% of ospB were deleted. These constructs were introduced into C. rodentium DBS100 by electroporation for allelic exchange and sucrose selection, and the respective deletion mutants, DBS100 ΔnleK, ΔespM2, ΔespT, ΔespX7, and ΔospB, were obtained and verified by multiple PCRs. Five to six-week-old female C57BL/6 and C3H/HeJ mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME), and housed in the animal facilities at the University of British Columbia in direct accordance with guidelines established by the Canadian Council on the Use of Laboratory Animals. All mouse experiments described here were approved by the University of British Columbia Animal Care Committee. Mice were infected by oral gavage with 100 μl of overnight C. rodentium cultures in LB broth (225 rpm at 37 °C) containing ∼3–5 × 108 bacteria. The C57BL/6 mice were sacrificed at 6 or 10 days post-infection. The whole colon, including luminal contents, was placed into 1 ml of sterile phosphate-buffered saline and homogenized with a MixerMill 301 (Retsch, Newtown, PA). Serial dilutions of the homogenate were plated on MacConkey (OXOID) agar plates. After incubation overnight at 37 °C, the C. rodentium colonies that display the distinctive morphology of a pink center with a white rim were enumerated. Tissues were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin overnight and then placed into 70% ethanol. Fixed tissues were embedded in paraffin and cut into 5-μm sections. Tissues were stained with hematoxylin and eosin by Wax-it Histology Services (Vancouver, BC), and subjected to pathological scoring (37.Coburn B. Li Y. Owen D. Vallance B.A. Finlay B.B. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 3219-3227Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Our aim was to use SILAC to identify proteins specifically secreted by the LEE-encoded T3SS in C. rodentium, i.e. the type III secretome. We have previously shown that, when grown statically in DMEM at 37 °C in a 5% CO2-containing environment, WT C. rodentium, EHEC,"
https://openalex.org/W2086575435,"Squalene belongs to the group of isoprenoids and is a precursor for the synthesis of sterols, steroids, and ubiquinones. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the amount of squalene can be increased by variation of growth conditions or by genetic manipulation. In this report, we show that a hem1Delta mutant accumulated a large amount of squalene, which was stored almost exclusively in cytoplasmic lipid particles/droplets. Interestingly, a strain bearing a hem1Delta deletion in a dga1Delta lro1Delta are1Delta are2Delta quadruple mutant background (QMhem1Delta), which is devoid of the classical storage lipids, triacylglycerols and steryl esters, and lacks lipid particles, accumulated squalene at similar amounts as the hem1Delta mutant in a wild type background. In QMhem1Delta, however, increased amounts of squalene were found in cellular membranes, especially in microsomes. The fact that QMhem1Delta did not form lipid particles indicated that accumulation of squalene solely was not sufficient to initiate proliferation of lipid particles. Most importantly, these results also demonstrated that (i) squalene was not lipotoxic under the conditions tested, and (ii) organelle membranes in yeast can accommodate relatively large quantities of this non-polar lipid without compromising cellular functions. In summary, localization of squalene as described here can be regarded as an unconventional example of non-polar lipid storage in cellular membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2025486291,"Five nontruncating missense APOB mutations, namely A31P, G275S, L324M, G912D, and G945S, were identified in heterozygous carriers of familial hypobetalipoproteinemia (FHBL) in the Italian population. To test that the FHBL phenotype was a result of impaired hepatic secretion of mutant apoB proteins, we performed transfection studies using McA-RH7777 cells stably expressing wild type or mutant forms of human apolipoprotein B-48 (apoB-48). All mutant proteins displayed varied impairment in secretion, with G912D the least affected and A31P barely secreted. Although some A31P was degraded by proteasomes, a significant proportion of it (although inappropriately glycosylated) escaped endoplasmic reticulum (ER) quality control and presented in the Golgi compartment. Degradation of the post-ER A31P was achieved by autophagy. Expression of A31P also decreased secretion of endogenous apoB and triglycerides, yet the impaired lipoprotein secretion did not lead to lipid accumulation in the cells or ER stress. Rather, expression of genes involved in lipogenesis was down-regulated, including liver X receptor α, sterol regulator element-binding protein 1c, fatty acid synthase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1, stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1, and lipin-1. These results suggest that feedback inhibition of hepatic lipogenesis in conjunction with post-ER degradation of misfolded apoB proteins can contribute to reduce fat accumulation in the FHBL liver.

The βα1 domain can bind to microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), an apoB-specific molecular chaperone that facilitates lipid recruitment during VLDL assembly (14.Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. Dashti N. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1401-1416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There are at least three MTP binding sites within the βα1 domain (residues 2–154, 430–570, and 512–721) (10.Mann C.J. Anderson T.A. Read J. Chester S.A. Harrison G.B. Köchl S. Ritchie P.J.

Although some studies have shown that secretion of the βα1 domain is independent of MTP (see Ref. 17.Dashti N. Manchekar M. Liu Y. Sun Z. Segrest J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 28597-28608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar and references cited within), there is no evidence showing that apoB-100 or apoB-48 can be secreted without the activity of MTP. VLDL assembly and maturation involve multiple lipidation steps that occur during trafficking of VLDL precursors throughout the ER/Golgi compartments (18.Olofsson S.O. Borèn J. J. Intern. Med. 2005; 258: 395-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The assembly process is highly dependent on the availability of lipids, mainly triacylglycerol (TAG). The activities of TAG synthesis enzymes, including DGAT1 (diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1) (19.Yamazaki T. Sasaki E. Kakinuma C. Yano T. Miura S. Ezaki O. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21506-21514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and lipin-1 (20.Bou Khalil M. Sundaram M. Zhang H.Y. Links P.H. Raven J.F. Manmontri B.

Increased de novo lipogenesis also contributes significantly to VLDL assembly/secretion. Regulation of hepatic lipogenesis requires a network of nuclear receptors that coordinately govern expression of the lipogenesis enzymes acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), fatty acid synthase (FAS), and SCD1 (stearoyl-CoA desaturase) (21.Musso G. Gambino R. Cassader M. Prog. Lipid Res. 2009; 48: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Transcription factors and co-factors regulating lipogenesis gene expression and VLDL production include liver X receptor α (LXRα) (22.Grefhorst A. Elzinga B.M. Voshol P.J. Plösch T. Kok T. Bloks V.W. van der Sluijs F.H. Havekes L.M. Romijn J.A. Verkade H.J. Kuipers F. J. Biol.

Because of the importance of the βα1 domain in VLDL assembly/secretion, we have searched for naturally occurring mutations within this domain that could affect apoB secretion. Recently, through molecular diagnosis of 110 Italian subjects with clinical diagnosis of FHBL, we discovered eight subjects carrying novel missense mutations, five of which occurred within the βα1 domain. The present studies showed that mutation A31P within the β-barrel severely impaired apoB secretion, and cells expressing the A31P mutant exhibited suppressed lipogenesis. Cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. Reagents for recombinant DNA experiments were obtained from New England Biolabs (Pickering, Canada). [2-3H]Glycerol (9.6 Ci/mmol) and [35S]methionine/cysteine (1,000 Ci/mmol) were obtained from GE Healthcare. [3H]Acetic acid (0.1 Ci/mmol) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Rabbit anti-mouse apoE antibody (used for immunoprecipitation) was obtained from BioDesign (Saco, ME). Horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-goat antibody and 3-methyladenine were obtained from Sigma. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG antibodies were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. MG132 was obtained from Calbiochem. Chemiluminescent substrates were purchased from Roche Applied Science. Trypsin was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). Antibodies against FAS and giantin (Abcam (Cambridge, MA)); ACC, phospho-ACC (at Ser79), calnexin, and actin (Millipore (Temecula, CA)); eIF2a and phospho-eIF2α (at Ser52) (Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA)); C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP or GADD153) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA)); and GRP78 (glucose-regulated protein 78) (Assay Designs (Ann Arbor, MI)) were purchased from the respective suppliers. Monoclonal antibody 1D1 against human apoB was a gift of Drs. Yves Marcel and Ross Milne (University of Ottawa Heart Institute). Anti-MTP antibody was a gift of Dr. Carol Shoulders (Medical Research Council Clinical Sciences Centre, Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK). Polyclonal antiserum against rat VLDL proteins (used for immunoprecipitation of rat apoB-100) was produced in our laboratory. The FHBL subjects were identified as probable heterozygous carriers during a survey of 110 consecutive individuals referred to the hospital for the presence of fatty liver associated with low plasma levels of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) and apoB (1.Tarugi P. Averna M. Di Leo E. Cefalù A.B. Noto D. Magnolo L. Cattin L. Bertolini S. Calandra S. Atherosclerosis. 2007; 195: e19-e27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The diagnosis of definite FHBL was based on three criteria: (i) LDL-C < 70 mg/dl and apoB < 50 mg/dl; (ii) exclusion of secondary hypocholesterolemia; and (iii) vertical transmission of the lipid and apoB phenotype in family. The diagnosis of probable heterozygous FHBL was made when reliable family data were unavailable. Sequencing of the APOB gene revealed pathogenic mutations in 54 subjects (1.Tarugi P. Averna M.

The majority of the mutations were located in the coding sequence of APOB. Fifty-one subjects were found to carry mutations causing the formation of truncated apoBs of various sizes (1.Tarugi P.

Three subjects were carriers of the previously described missense mutation R463W (6.Burnett J.R. Shan J. Miskie B.A. Whitfield A.J. Yuan J. Tran K. McKnight C.J. Hegele R.A. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13442-13452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), known to be the cause of FHBL. Five subjects (four with definite and one with probable FHBL) were heterozygous for rare non-conserved APOB gene mutations, namely G945S, A31P, L324M, G912D, and G275S (1.Tarugi P. Averna M.

The present study focused on these five mutations. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood (NucleoSpin Blood L, Macherey-Nagel, Duren, Germany). The entire APOB gene coding region, including the 5′-flanking region and at least 50 base pairs of intronic sequence at each intron-exon boundary (GenBankTM accession number AY324608.1, GI:32187678) were amplified by PCR and sequenced as previously described (24.Tarugi P. Lonardo A. Gabelli C. Sala F. Ballarini G. Cortella I. Previato L. Bertolini S. Cordera R. Calandra S. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1552-1561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sequences were detected on an ABI PRISM 3100 DNA sequencer, and results were analyzed with ABI PRISM SeqScape software (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK). Only a few members of the five kindred were available for DNA analysis. The APOB gene mutations found in the probands were screened in family members available for the study by sequencing the appropriate gene regions (25.Di Leo E. Magnolo L. Lancellotti S. Crocè L. Visintin L. Tiribelli C. Bertolini S. Calandra S. Tarugi P. J. Med. Genet. 2007; 44: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Sequence variants were confirmed by using a second independent amplification of the affected DNA region and resequencing in both directions. One hundred control subjects randomly selected among normolipidemic individuals of both sexes were screened for the mutations of the APOB gene found in FHBL patients by direct sequencing of the appropriate gene regions or by restriction enzyme digestion of PCR products. APOB gene mutations are described according to mutation nomenclature (available on the Human Genome Variation Society Web site) (26.den Dunnen J.T. Antonarakis S.E. Hum. Mutat. 2000; 15: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (1516) Google Scholar, 27.den Dunnen J.T. Paalman M.H. Hum. Mutat. 2003; 22: 181-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Nucleotide numbers are derived from APOB cDNA sequence (GenBankTM accession number NM_000384). Amino acid sequence changes in apoB are described according to the National Centre for Biotechnology Information reference sequence (NP_000375.2, GI:105990532). The apoE genotype was performed as described (28.Fasano T. Cefalù A.B. Di Leo E. Noto D. Pollaccia D. Bocchi L. Valenti V. Bonardi R. Guardamagna O. Averna M. Tarugi P. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2007; 27: 677-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Informed consent was obtained from all probands (or in the case of children from their parents) and their family members as well as from control subjects. The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia and is in accordance with ethical standards as formulated by the Helsinki Declaration of 1975 (revised in 1983). Blood samples were collected after an overnight fast. Plasma total cholesterol, TAG, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, LDL-C, apoA-I, and apoB levels were determined with enzymatic methods (Roche Applied Science) by using a Hitachi 912 autoanalyzer. Plasma lipoproteins were also separated by density gradient ultracentrifugation (24.Tarugi P. Lonardo A. Gabelli C. Sala F. Ballarini G. Cortella I. Previato L. Bertolini S. Cordera R. Calandra S. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1552-1561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated lipoprotein fractions were precipitated in 10% trichloroacetic acid and extracted with ethanol diethyl ether (3:2, v/v), and apolipoproteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (3.5/5–10% gel for apoB and 5–20% gel for other proteins) (24.Tarugi P.

The mutagenic primers used to introduce the A31P, G275S, L324M, G912D, and G945S mutations were listed in supplemental Table 1. The expression plasmids were purified by the Qiagen plasmid purification kit (Qiagen, Milano, Italy), and the APOB coding regions were authenticated by sequencing. Stable expression of all of the recombinant apoB-48 proteins was achieved using McA-RH7777 cells as described previously (29.Blackhart B.D. Yao Z.M. McCarthy B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8358-8360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 10% horse serum. Stable clones were selected with G418 (400 μg/ml), and those that showed secretion of apoB-48 mutants at similar levels were maintained in G418 (200 μg/ml) for experiments. Expression of apoB-48 and apoB-17 was determined by Western blotting of conditioned media using monoclonal antibody 1D1 that has an epitope at amino acids 401–582 of human apoB-100 (8.McLeod R.S. Zhao Y. Selby S.L. Westerlund J. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2852-2862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lipoproteins presented in the microsomal lumen or secreted into the media were fractionated into VLDL1, VLDL2, and other lipoproteins as described previously (30.Wang Y. McLeod R.S. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12272-12278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Subcellular fractionation of ER and Golgi microsome and analysis of endoglycosidase H (Endo H) sensitivity of apoB-48 proteins associated with the microsomes were performed as described previously (31.Tran K.

Cells were cultured in DMEM containing 20% FBS and 0.4 mm oleate for 2 h and harvested in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 20% sucrose, protease inhibitor mixture). The lysate samples were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C by gentle mixing, and the insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation (13,000 rpm, 4 °C, 15 min). An aliquot of the supernatant (750 μg of protein) was mixed with lysis buffer to a final volume of 1 ml. The samples were precleared by incubation with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (2 h, 4 °C) prior to incubation with monoclonal antibody 1D1 that had been coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B beads as described previously (30.Wang Y. McLeod R.S. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12272-12278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). After overnight incubation at 4 °C, the proteins were eluted and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis to quantify apoB, MTP, and GRP78. Post-translational stability and secretion efficiency of apoB (recombinant apoB-48 and endogenous apoB-100) were determined by pulse-chase experiments with [35S]methionine/cysteine as described previously (7.Burnett J.R. Zhong S. Jiang Z.G. Hooper A.J. Fisher E.A. McLeod R.S. Zhao Y. Barrett P.H. Hegele R.A. van Bockxmeer F.M. Zhang H. Vance D.E. McKnight C.J. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24270-24283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In some experiments, the post-translational stability and secretion of apoB-48 mass were determined in the presence of cycloheximide (10 μm) (32.Borén J. Graham L. Wettesten M. Scott J. White A. Olofsson S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9858-9867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells (in 60-mm dishes) were cultured in DMEM containing 20% FBS and 0.4 mm oleate for 0, 1, 2, and 4 h. Cycloheximide was added to the media at time 0. The cell and medium samples were collected at the indicated times, and the recombinant apoB-48 proteins were recovered from cells and media, respectively, by immunoprecipitation. After SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, the intensity of apoB-48 bands was quantified by scanning densitometry. Synthesis and secretion of TAG and phosphatidylcholine (PC) were determined by metabolic labeling of cells with either [3H]glycerol for 1 and 2 h in DMEM containing 20% FBS and 0.4 mm oleate or [3H]acetic acid for up to 8 h in DMEM containing 20% FBS. Extraction and analysis of lipids by thin layer chromatography were performed as described previously (20.Bou Khalil M. Sundaram M. Zhang H.Y. Links P.H. Raven J.F. Manmontri B. Sariahmetoglu M. Tran K. Reue K. Brindley D.N. Yao Z. J. Lipid Res. 2009; 50: 47-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Total cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were visualized by silver staining, and bands of interest were excised and subjected to in-gel digestion as described previously (33.Abu-Farha M. Lambert J.P. Al-Madhoun A.S. Elisma F. Skerjanc I.S. Figeys D. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2008; 7: 560-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) with modifications. The gel pieces (∼1 mm3) were washed with 50 mm NH4HCO3 and subsequently dehydrated in 50% acetonitrile (v/v) and 25 mm NH4HCO3 (at room temperature, 15 min). After aspirating the supernatant, the gel pieces were dried under vacuum and treated with 10 mm dithiothreitol (in 50 mm NH4HCO3) at 56 °C for 15 min to reduce disulfide bonds. Free -SH groups were alkylated with 100 mm iodoacetamide (in 50 mm NH4HCO3) for 15 min in darkness at room temperature. The gel pieces were dehydrated again in 50% acetonitrile (v/v) as described above and subjected to trypsin digestion (20 ng of trypsin/μl in 50 mm NH4HCO3) at 37 °C overnight. Peptides were extracted from the gel pieces with 5% formic acid (v/v) and 50% acetonitrile (v/v) with sonication in ice-cold aqueous solution and dried under vacuum. The peptide samples were stored at −20 °C prior to mass spectrometric analysis. The liquid chromatography-MS/MS was performed as described previously (34.Zhou H. Hou W. Denis N.J. Zhou H. Vasilescu J. Zou H. Figeys D. J. Proteome Res. 2009; 8: 556-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The resulting peptides from the gel bands were resolved in 5% formic acid and loaded on a 200 μm × 50-mm fused silica precolumn packed in house with 5 cm of 5-μm YMC ODS-A C18 beads (Waters Co. (Milford, MA)) using an 1100 micro-HPLC system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Following a desalting step, the flow was split, and peptides were eluted through a second 75 μm × 50-mm column packed with the same beads at ∼200 nl/min. The peptides were eluted using a 2-h gradient (5–80% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid) into an ESI LTQ linear ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron, Waltham, MA). MS/MS spectra were acquired in a data-dependent acquisition mode that automatically selected and fragmented the 10 most intense peaks from each mass spectrum generated. The acquired MS/MS spectra were searched against the mouse International Protein Index protein sequence data base (version 3.52, 39,906 protein sequences; European Bioinformatics Institute) augmented with the reversed sequence of each entry in the forward data base. Mascot 2.2.02 (Matrix Science) was used to search the protein sequence data base. The precursor and fragment mass tolerances for the LTQ data were set at 2.0 and 0.8 Da, respectively. Mascot cut-off scores were set to 30. Peptides ranked with a probability-based Mowse (expect) p < 0.05 were accepted. The false positive rate was controlled at <1%. The identified proteins with the expected molecular weight and at least two non-redundant peptides were accepted after rigorous filtration as described above. Isolation of RNA from cells, reverse transcription, and relative mRNA concentration determination by real-time RT-PCR were performed as described previously (20.Bou Khalil M. Sundaram M. Zhang H.Y. Links P.H. Raven J.F. Manmontri B. Sariahmetoglu M. Tran K. Reue K. Brindley D.N. Yao Z. J. Lipid Res. 2009; 50: 47-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Cyclophilin A was used as the real-time RT-PCR control. The primers used for RT-PCR were obtained from Sigma, and the sequences of the primers are listed in supplemental Table 2. The homology model of the N-terminal 930 amino acids of apoB-100 (apoB-20.5) was constructed using MODELLER 7.7 using standard parameters (35.Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10563) Google Scholar) and the coordinates of lamprey lipovitellin (36.Thompson J.R. Banaszak L.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9398-9409Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The sequences of apoB20.5 and lipovitellin were aligned using the Blast-2-Sequence program (37.Tatusova T.A. Madden T.L.

The “enhanced gating mode” appears to reflect protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation. Here we examine two candidates for PKC-δ phosphorylation sites in the human voltage-gated proton channel, HV1 (Hvcn1), Thr29 and Ser97, both in the intracellular N terminus. Channel phosphorylation was reduced in single mutants S97A or T29A, and further in the double mutant T29A/S97A, by an in vitro kinase assay with PKC-δ. Enhanced gating was evaluated by expressing wild-type (WT) or mutant HV1 channels in LK35.2 cells, a B cell hybridoma. Stimulation by phorbol myristate acetate enhanced WT channel gating, and this effect was reversed by treatment with the PKC inhibitor GF109203X. The single mutant T29A or double mutant T29A/S97A failed to respond to phorbol myristate acetate or GF109203X. In contrast, the S97A mutant responded like cells transfected with WT HV1.

This phosphorylation is crucial to activation of the proton conductance during the respiratory burst in phagocytes. Voltage-gated proton channels enable sustained superoxide anion (O2̇̄) production by NADPH oxidase during the respiratory burst in phagocytes. NADPH oxidase generates O2̇̄ by transferring electrons from NADPH in the cytosol across the membrane to reduce extracellular or phagosomal O2 to O2̇̄. O2̇̄ is the precursor to other reactive oxygen species that contribute to killing microbial invaders. The consequences of NADPH oxidase activity, in particular decreased internal pH (pHi) and membrane depolarization, are counteracted by H+ efflux through open voltage-gated proton channels (1.Henderson L.M.

This “enhanced gating mode” consists of four changes in proton channel properties, each of which increases the likelihood of channel opening under any given set of conditions. The channels open faster (smaller activation time constant, τact) 3The abbreviations used are: τactactivation time constantτtaildeactivation (tail current) time constantgHproton conductancegH-Vproton conductance-voltage relationshipIHsteady-state proton current amplitudeCGDchronic granulomatous diseaseGFXGF109203XHV1the human Hvcn1 voltage-gated proton channel gene productPKCprotein kinase CPMAphorbol myristate acetateWTwild typeBES2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]ethanesulfonic acid. and close more slowly (larger deactivation time constant, τtail), display increased maximum proton conductance (gH,max), and manifest a 40-mV hyperpolarizing shift of the entire proton conductance-voltage relationship (gH-V). The enhanced gating mode improves the efficiency of NADPH oxidase by minimizing the depolarization required to open enough proton channels to fully compensate the electrical consequences of NADPH oxidase activity (i.e. the electron current) (5.Murphy R.

The enhanced gating mode is induced by PMA, an activator of PKC, and is prevented and at least partially reversed by the PKC inhibitor GFX (9.Bankers-Fulbright J.L. Kita H. Gleich G.J. O'Grady S.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 189: 306-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 10.Morgan D. Cherny V.V. Finnegan A. Bollinger J. Gelb M.H. DeCoursey T.E. J. Physiol. 2007; 579: 327-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Although these results suggest regulation by PKC phosphorylation, they do not clarify whether the target of PKC is an accessory protein or the channel itself. This study identifies phosphorylation sites on the human proton channel molecule and determines their involvement in converting the proton channel to the enhanced gating mode. We find that a single residue, Thr29, in the intracellular N-terminal domain appears to be responsible for inducing enhanced gating. Evidently, enhanced gating reflects a phosphorylated state of the proton channel and does not require accessory proteins. Myc-tagged Hvcn1 was cloned by PCR in green fluorescent protein-bicistronic MigRI retroviral vector. Hvcn1 T29A/S97A, T29A, T29D, S97A, and S97D mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis of wild-type Hvcn1 sequence in MigRI vector using the Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) QuikChange technology. Sequences of primers used for mutagenesis are available upon request. Lentiviral particles were prepared as follows. Phoenix α packaging cell line was transfected with empty vector control and Hvcn1 MigRI plasmids by Ca2+ phosphate transfection. Viral supernatants were collected after 24, 36, and 48 h and frozen at −80 °C until use. LK35.2 cells were infected by spinoculation at 2300 rpm for 90 min in the presence of 4 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma Aldrich, Dorset, UK) three times over a period of 2 days. At day 3, highly green fluorescent-protein-positive cells were sorted on a FACSVantage with CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson, Oxford, UK) and used for patch clamp studies. HEK-293 cells were transfected with Myc-tagged Hvcn1, Hvcn1 T29A/S97A, Hvcn1 T29A, and Hvcn1 S97A MigRI constructs by Ca2+ phosphate. 24 h after transfection, cells were harvested and lysed (1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Hepes, 137 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3O4, 2 mm EDTA, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma Aldrich)) prior to immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) conjugated to protein G-Sepharose beads. Beads were then incubated in kinase assay buffer (20 mm Hepes, 1 mm EGTA, 0.4 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.05 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mg/ml phosphatidylinositol, 2.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 μm PMA, 40 mm PKC-δ (Cell Signaling Technology), 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (GE Healthcare)) for 20 min at 30 °C, prior to being suspended in 2× Laemmli buffer. Four-fifths of samples were loaded on an SDS-PAGE that was then dried in a gel dryer prior to exposure to x-ray film; one-fifth of samples was loaded on a separate SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted with anti-Myc as loading control. The recording and data analysis setups were as described previously (11.Morgan D. Cherny V.V. Murphy R. Xu W. Thomas L.L. DeCoursey T.E. J. Physiol. 2003; 550: 447-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Pipettes were made from 7052 glass (Garner Glass Co., Claremont, CA). Seals were formed with Ringer's solution (in mm: 160 NaCl, 4.5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 5 Hepes, pH 7.4) in the bath, and the potential was zeroed after the pipette was in contact with the cell. For perforated patch recording, the pipette and bath solutions (∼300 mosm) contained 130 mm tetramethylammonium methanesulfonate, 50 mm NH4+ in the form of 25 mm (NH4)2SO4, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm BES buffer, 1 mm EGTA and was titrated to pH 7.0 with tetramethylammonium hydroxide. The pipette solution included ∼500 μg/ml solubilized amphotericin B (∼45% purity; Sigma); the pipette tip was dipped in amphotericin-free solution. Experiments were done at 21 °C or at room temperature (20–25 °C). The τact was obtained by fitting the rising current with a single exponential function, ignoring the initial sigmoid component. The steady-state H+ current (IH) was extrapolated using the fitted time constant. Deactivation was quantified by fitting tail currents with a single exponential to obtain the τtail. The values obtained for IH along with reversal potential measured in each cell were used to calculate the gH-V relationship. Shifts in the gH-V relationship were assessed using plots like that in Fig. 2D and determining the shift by interpolation at the smallest reliable gH values (where the voltage dependence is steepest). In some situations, the voltage at which time-dependent proton current was first detected, Vthreshold, was used as a rough indicator of the position of the gH-V relationship (12.Musset B. Cherny V.V. Morgan D. Okamura Y. Ramsey I.S. Clapham D.E. DeCoursey T.E. J. Physiol. 2008; 586: 2477-2486Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We routinely waited for stable recording conditions, added PMA, and later introduced GFX and considered the response genuine if PMA increased and GFX decreased the current. That the observed PMA responses were genuine was strongly corroborated by their reversal by GFX. Thus, although proton currents might increase due to improved access through the patch membrane or other spurious causes, it is unlikely that such increases would be reversed by GFX. Cells that were judged, based on access resistance, to have spontaneously entered whole-cell configuration were excluded from analysis. Responses to PMA or GFX are presented as ratios such that 1.0 means no response and a larger number means a larger response. Thus, for PMA responses, IH(PMA)/IH(control) and τact(control)/τact(PMA) are given. For GFX responses, IH(PMA)/IH(GFX) and τact(GFX)/τact(PMA) are given. Shifts in the gH-V relationship were determined by interpolation of gH values at voltages just above threshold. Fig. 1A shows the positions of two candidates for PKC phosphorylation sites tested here, Thr29 and Ser97. These were identified by criteria determined by Fujii et al. (13.Fujii K. Zhu G. Liu Y. Hallam J. Chen L. Herrero J. Shaw S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 13744-13749Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Both occur in the N terminus on intracellular regions of the human voltage-gated proton channel (HV1) protein. It should be noted that because the structure of the proton channel is not known, the proximity of these sites to the membrane or to other parts of the channel is not established. Phosphorylation of these sites upon PMA stimulation was assessed in an in vitro kinase assay with recombinant PKC-δ. Fig. 1B shows that phosphorylation was reduced significantly when compared with WT HV1 for either single mutant S97A or T29A. Phosphorylation was further reduced in the double mutant T29A/S97A, which supports the conclusion that both sites are phosphorylated by PKC-δ. Identifying sites that might contribute to enhanced gating requires an expression system in which expressed proton channels respond to PMA. Although proton channels in human neutrophils and eosinophils respond dramatically to PMA (7.DeCoursey T.E. Cherny V.V. Zhou W. Thomas L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 6885-6889Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 14.DeCoursey T.E. Cherny V.V. DeCoursey A.G. Xu W. Thomas L.L. J. Physiol. 2001; 535: 767-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), HEK-293 cells transfected with the proton channel, Hvcn1, do not respond (12.Musset B. Cherny V.V. Morgan D. Okamura Y. Ramsey I.S. Clapham D.E. DeCoursey T.E. J. Physiol. 2008; 586: 2477-2486Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, we found that when Hvcn1 is expressed in the B lymphocytic cell line, LK35.2, the resulting proton current responds to PMA in a manner qualitatively like the response of human phagocytes (Fig. 2F). An advantage of the LK35.2 B lymphocytic line is that cells that were not transfected or transfected with empty vector had no detectable proton currents (n = 8), whereas LK35.2 cells transfected with Hvcn1 expressed large proton currents (Fig. 2A). The experimental approach is illustrated in Fig. 2F. Test pulses were applied, and then PMA was introduced, after which the proton current amplitude IH increased progressively over several minutes. On average, IH increased 2.4-fold during test pulses (Table 1). After application of a voltage clamp family and measurement of the reversal potential, Vrev, test pulses were again applied. Then GFX was added to the bath, and the enhanced proton current was progressively reduced toward its amplitude before stimulation.TABLE 1Effects of PMA and GFX on proton channel parameters (mean ± S.E.

Fig. 2D shows that PMA increased gH and shifted the gH-V relationship negatively. The mean shift of the gH-V relationship was −11 mV (Table 1). GFX reversed this shift substantially. The rate of channel opening increased after PMA stimulation; the time constant of H+ current activation, τact, became twice faster. Fig. 2E shows that the proportional change in τact was similar at all voltages. GFX reversed the change in τact (Fig. 2E). The effects of PMA and GFX on proton channel parameters are summarized in Table 1. In contrast with the responses of proton currents in human phagocytes, there was little slowing of deactivation (τtail). The differences in the PMA responses of LK35.2 cells when compared with human neutrophils may reflect the lack of NADPH oxidase activity in LK35.2 cells (15.Musset B. Cherny V.V. Morgan D. DeCoursey T.E. FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) (see “Discussion”). The two candidate phosphorylation sites were mutated to Ala individually (S97A and T29A) and together. We also studied mutants S97D and T29D designed as phosphorylation mimics. LK35.2 cells transfected with the double mutant proton channel (S97A/T29A) never responded detectably to PMA or GFX (n = 15). Similarly, no response was detected in the T29A (Fig. 2G) or T29D mutants, with the exception of a possible small response in 1 of 12 cells studied. However, the S97A and S97D mutants did respond (Table 1). Combined, these results strongly implicate Thr29 as the key phosphorylation site on the human proton channel. If Thr29 is the primary phosphorylation site, then the designed phosphorylation mimic T29D might already appear “activated,” in comparison with WT channels. In this scenario, the expectation would be that the threshold voltage, Vthreshold, would be more negative than WT. Examination of Vthreshold for such an effect revealed that the WT channel was first distinctly activated at +2.1 ± 2.2 mV (mean ± S.E., n = 17). Vthreshold in T29D expressing cells was −0.7 ± 4.4 mV (n = 7), a small shift in the expected direction but not significantly different. The effects of PMA and GFX on individual cells are clearly evident because each cell serves as its own control. In contrast, detecting a small difference in properties between populations of unstimulated cells may not be feasible. Alternatively, phosphorylation mimics (X → Glu or X → Asp) are not always distinguishable from simple alanine mutants (X → Ala) (16.Sumandea M.P. Pyle W.G. Kobayashi T. de Tombe P.P. Solaro R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35135-35144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The lack of response of Thr29 mutants suggests that the entire phosphorylation response is ascribable to phosphorylation of Thr29. However, we compared the responses in Ser97 mutants statistically to test the possibility that Ser97 might contribute measurably to the response (Table 1). Although the enhancement of proton channel gating by PMA and its reversal by GFX tended to be larger in WT controls than in Ser97 mutants, the difference failed to reach statistical significance for any parameter (whether S97A and S97D were compared with WT separately or together). However, the probability that all eight parameters would exhibit smaller responses in S97X than WT is <0.01. Thus, we cannot rule out that Ser97 may play a minor role or affect other functions of the channel. However, it is clear that phosphorylation of Thr29 is the major contributor to the enhanced gating of proton channels. Voltage-gated proton channels are necessary for a normal phagocyte respiratory burst; NADPH oxidase activity by neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes, macrophages, B lymphocytes and PLB-985 cells is greatly reduced when proton currents are inhibited by Zn2+ or other polyvalent metal cations (4.DeCoursey T.E.

Proton channels and NADPH oxidase are both activated during phagocytosis, but their interaction is complex, and the mechanism remains controversial (15.Musset B. Cherny V.V. Morgan D. DeCoursey T.E. FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The idea that the proton channel is part of the NADPH oxidase complex (26.Henderson L.M. Banting G. Chappell J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5909-5916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and is thus active de facto during NADPH oxidase activity (3.Bánfi B. Schrenzel J. Nüsse O. Lew D.P. Ligeti E. Krause K.H. Demaurex N. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) appears untenable in light of the demonstration of NADPH oxidase-generated electron current in phagocytes from Hvcn1-deficient mice (6.Morgan D. Capasso M. Musset B. Cherny V.V. Ríos E. Dyer M.J. DeCoursey T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 18022-18027Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Another view is that these two molecules are activated independently but by similar pathways (10.Morgan D. Cherny V.V. Finnegan A. Bollinger J. Gelb M.H. DeCoursey T.E. J. Physiol. 2007; 579: 327-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The suspicion that voltage-gated proton channels in leukocytes are activated by PKC phosphorylation (10.Morgan D. Cherny V.V.

J. 1992; 281: 697-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) is strongly supported by the present results. Furthermore, our data indicate that the channel protein itself is phosphorylated. The in vitro kinase assay detected phosphorylation of both Ser97 and Thr29. However, in our experimental system, Thr29 appeared to be responsible for the entire measurable response of proton channels. T29A or T29D mutants did not respond to PMA, nor did the double mutant T29A/S97A. In contrast, S97A or S97D mutants did respond to PMA, although their response may have been slightly weaker than that of WT channels (Table 1). These results do not resolve the physiological significance of phosphorylation of Ser97. That Ser97 was phosphorylated, yet S97A and S97D exhibited no deficit, is not without precedent. Many proteins have multiple phosphorylation sites of which only a fraction exert specific functional effects. For example, cardiac troponin T has four phosphorylation sites, of which only one exhibited functional defects upon mutation (16.Sumandea M.P. Pyle W.G. Kobayashi T. de Tombe P.P. Solaro R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35135-35144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Another protein with multiple phosphorylation sites is p47phox, whose phosphorylation is an absolute prerequisite for NADPH oxidase assembly and function. Individual mutation of 10 phosphorylated serines revealed just one mutation, S379A, that abolished activation, five Ser → Ala mutations that inhibited activation by ∼50%, and three that had no effect (29.El-Benna J. Dang P.M. Gougerot-Pocidalo M.A. Marie J.C. Braut-Boucher F. Exp. Mol. Med. 2009; 41: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In future studies, we will attempt to identify the PKC isoform that phosphorylates the proton channel. By criteria determined by Fujii et al. (13.Fujii K. Zhu G. Liu Y. Hallam J. Chen L. Herrero J. Shaw S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 13744-13749Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), Thr29 is a likely PKC-δ site, but ScanSite identifies Thr29 as a possible target for cAMP-dependent protein kinase, PKC-μ, Akt kinase, or calmodulin kinase. Ser97 is also identified by criteria determined by Fujii et al. (13.Fujii K. Zhu G. Liu Y. Hallam J. Chen L. Herrero J. Shaw S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

PKC-δ appears to be important in responses of human phagocytes (9.Bankers-Fulbright J.L. Kita H. Gleich G.J. O'Grady S.M. J. Cell.

Ramsey I.S. Clapham D.E. DeCoursey T.E. J. Physiol. 2008; 586: 2477-2486Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), do not respond at all. Hypothetical explanations for this variable response in different tissues include (a) different proton channel isoforms, (b) different signaling pathways, and (c) regulation of the channel by a separate molecule whose phosphorylation modulates proton channel behavior (15.Musset B. Cherny V.V. Morgan D. DeCoursey T.E. FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Our results do not support the existence of a separate regulatory molecule (other than NADPH oxidase; see next paragraph). Proton channels expressed in the B lymphocytic cell line LK35.2 were found to respond qualitatively like those in primary leukocytes, but the response was substantially less profound (Table 1). Each of the four main responses is weaker in LK35.2 cells than in neutrophils, but the most obvious differences are the lack of profound slowing of channel closing (τtail) and the smaller hyperpolarizing shift of the gH-V relationship. The requirements for a full phagocyte-like proton channel response are unclear. Circumstantial evidence suggests that a crucial factor is the presence or absence of NADPH oxidase activity. Neutrophils from chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) patients lack functional NADPH oxidase and also exhibit a reduced PMA response with no slowing of τtail and only an ∼10-mV hyperpolarization of the gH-V relationship (36.DeCoursey T.E.

We did not detect electron current in PMA-stimulated LK35.2 cells, consistent with low levels of NADPH oxidase activity (23.Capasso, M., Bhamrah, M. K., Henley, T., Boyd, R. S., Langlais, C., Cain, K., Dinsdale, D., Pulford, K., Khan, M., Musset, B., Cherny, V. V., Morgan, D., Gascoyne, R. D., Vigorito, E., DeCoursey, T. E., MacLennan, I. C., Dyer, M. J. (2010) Nat.

Human basophils also lack NADPH oxidase and exhibit PMA and GFX responses smaller than those of neutrophils or eosinophils and specifically lack a slowing of τtail (35.Musset B. Morgan D. Cherny V.V. MacGlashan Jr., D.W. Thomas L.L. Ríos E. DeCoursey T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 11020-11025Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thus, it is clear that a proton channel response is possible without NADPH oxidase, but the response differs in characteristic ways from that in cells with NADPH oxidase activity. The alternative postulate, that proton channels are preferentially phosphorylated by specific PKC isoforms that are more active in phagocytes, does not explain the meager response of CGD neutrophils (Table 1). In summary, enhanced gating of HV1 is primarily the result of phosphorylation at Thr29 by PKC. The magnitude and specific characteristics of the PMA response in LK35.2 cells closely resembled that in other cells lacking NADPH oxidase activity, suggesting that a crucial interaction between these molecules occurs in phagocytes. The identification of the location of the key phosphorylation site that activates phagocyte proton channels provides a rational target for modulation of innate immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W2036032013,"Our recent studies indicate that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress causes INS-1 cell apoptosis by a Ca(2+)-independent phospholipase A(2) (iPLA(2)beta)-mediated mechanism that promotes ceramide generation via sphingomyelin hydrolysis and subsequent activation of the intrinsic pathway. To elucidate the association between iPLA(2)beta and ER stress, we compared beta-cell lines generated from wild type (WT) and Akita mice. The Akita mouse is a spontaneous model of ER stress that develops hyperglycemia/diabetes due to ER stress-induced beta-cell apoptosis. Consistent with a predisposition to developing ER stress, basal phosphorylated PERK and activated caspase-3 are higher in the Akita cells than WT cells. Interestingly, basal iPLA(2)beta, mature SREBP-1 (mSREBP-1), phosphorylated Akt, and neutral sphingomyelinase (NSMase) are higher, relative abundances of sphingomyelins are lower, and mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi) is compromised in Akita cells, in comparison with WT cells. Exposure to thapsigargin accelerates DeltaPsi loss and apoptosis of Akita cells and is associated with increases in iPLA(2)beta, mSREBP-1, and NSMase in both WT and Akita cells. Transfection of Akita cells with iPLA(2)beta small interfering RNA, however, suppresses NSMase message, DeltaPsi loss, and apoptosis. The iPLA(2)beta gene contains a sterol-regulatory element, and transfection with a dominant negative SREBP-1 reduces basal mSREBP-1 and iPLA(2)beta in the Akita cells and suppresses increases in mSREBP-1 and iPLA(2)beta due to thapsigargin. These findings suggest that ER stress leads to generation of mSREBP-1, which can bind to the sterol-regulatory element in the iPLA(2)beta gene to promote its transcription. Consistent with this, SREBP-1, iPLA(2)beta, and NSMase messages in Akita mouse islets are higher than in WT islets."
https://openalex.org/W1968360648,"BRISC (Brcc36-containing isopeptidase complex) is a four-subunit deubiquitinating (DUB) enzyme that has a catalytic subunit, called Brcc36, that is a member of the JAMM/MPN(+) family of zinc metalloproteases. A notable feature of BRISC is its high specificity for cleaving Lys(63)-linked polyubiquitin. Here, we show that BRISC selectivity is not due to preferential binding to Lys(63)-linked polyubiquitin but is instead dictated by how the substrate isopeptide linkage is oriented within the enzyme active site. BRISC possesses a high affinity binding site for the ubiquitin hydrophobic surface patch that accounts for the bulk of the affinity between enzyme and substrate. Although BRISC can interact with either subunit of a diubiquitin conjugate, substrate cleavage occurs only when BRISC is bound to the hydrophobic patch of the distal (i.e. the ""S1"") ubiquitin at a ubiquitin-ubiquitin cleavage site. The importance of the Lys(63)-linked proximal (S1') ubiquitin was underscored by our finding that BRISC could not cleave the isopeptide bond joining a ubiquitin to a non-ubiquitin substrate. Finally, we also show that Abro1, another BRISC subunit, binds directly to Brcc36 and that the Brcc36-Abro1 heterodimer includes a minimal complex with Lys(63)-specific DUB activity."
https://openalex.org/W2007088638,"Calcineurin is a protein phosphatase that is uniquely regulated by sustained increases in intracellular Ca(2+) following signal transduction events. Calcineurin controls cellular proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and inducible gene expression following stress and neuroendocrine stimulation. In the adult heart, calcineurin regulates hypertrophic growth of cardiomyocytes in response to pathologic insults that are associated with altered Ca(2+) handling. Here we determined that calcineurin signaling is directly linked to the proper control of cardiac contractility, rhythm, and the expression of Ca(2+)-handling genes in the heart. Our approach involved a cardiomyocyte-specific deletion using a CnB1-LoxP-targeted allele in mice and three different cardiac-expressing Cre alleles/transgenes. Deletion of calcineurin with the Nkx2.5-Cre knock-in allele resulted in lethality at 1 day after birth due to altered right ventricular morphogenesis, reduced ventricular trabeculation, septal defects, and valvular overgrowth. Slightly later deletion of calcineurin with the alpha-myosin heavy chain Cre transgene resulted in lethality in early mid adulthood that was characterized by substantial reductions in cardiac contractility, severe arrhythmia, and reduced myocyte content in the heart. Young calcineurin heart-deleted mice died suddenly after pressure overload stimulation or neuroendocrine agonist infusion, and telemetric monitoring of older mice showed arrhythmia leading to sudden death. Mechanistically, loss of calcineurin reduced expression of key Ca(2+)-handling genes that likely lead to arrhythmia and reduced contractility. Loss of calcineurin also directly impacted cellular proliferation in the postnatal developing heart. These results reveal multiple mechanisms whereby calcineurin regulates cardiac development and myocyte contractility."

Importantly, the 4-1BB-4-1BBL pathway is a well known target for anti-cancer immunotherapy. Here we present the 2.3-A crystal structure of the extracellular domain of human 4-1BBL. The ectodomain forms a homotrimer with an extended, three-bladed propeller structure that differs from trimers formed by other members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily. Based on the 4-1BBL structure, we modeled its complex with 4-1BB, which was consistent with images obtained by electron microscopy, and verified the binding site by site-directed mutagenesis. This structural information will facilitate the development of immunotherapeutics targeting 4-1BB."
https://openalex.org/W1977805969,"The regulation of NFATc1 expression is important for osteoclast differentiation and function. Herein, we demonstrate that macrophage-colony-stimulating factor induces NFATc1 degradation via Cbl proteins in a Src kinase-dependent manner. NFATc1 proteins are ubiquitinated and rapidly degraded during late stage osteoclastogenesis, and this degradation is mediated by Cbl-b and c-Cbl ubiquitin ligases in a Src-dependent manner. In addition, NFATc1 interacts endogenously with c-Src, c-Cbl, and Cbl-b in osteoclasts. Overexpression of c-Src induces down-regulation of NFATc1, and depletion of Cbl proteins blocks NFATc1 degradation during late stage osteoclastogenesis. Taken together, our data provide a negative regulatory mechanism by which macrophage-colony-stimulating factor activates Src family kinases and Cbl proteins, and subsequently, induces NFATc1 degradation during osteoclast differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1978825205,"Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) regulates many biological processes, and aberrant TGF-beta signaling is implicated in tumor development. Smad3 is a central component of the TGF-beta signaling pathway, and once activated, Smad3 forms complexes with Smad4 or other receptor-regulated Smads, which accumulate in the nucleus to transcriptionally regulate TGF-beta target genes. Because Smad3 plays a significant role in mediating the activities of TGF-beta, we examined its regulation during tumor development using a well characterized tumor model. We demonstrate that Smad3 levels are dramatically reduced in the tumorigenic cell line transformed with activated H-Ras compared with the normal parental epithelial cells. Interestingly, we also observe a cell cycle-dependent regulation of Smad3 in both cell types, with high Smad3 levels in quiescent cells and a significant drop in Smad3 protein levels in proliferating cells. Smad3 is regulated at the mRNA level and at the level of protein stability. In addition, functional analysis indicates that down-regulation of Smad3 levels is required for the tumor cells to proliferate in the presence of TGF-beta, because ectopic expression of Smad3 in the tumorigenic cell line restores the growth inhibitory response to TGF-beta. In contrast, expression of high levels of Smad3 did not interfere with the ability of these cells to undergo epithelial to mesenchymal transition upon TGF-beta stimulation. Altogether, our results suggest that the level of Smad3 protein is an important determinant of the progression of tumorigenesis. High levels of Smad3 are required for the tumor suppressor activities of TGF-beta, whereas lower levels are sufficient for the tumor promoting functions."

TAK1 is expressed in proliferating C2C12 myoblasts, and its levels are reduced upon differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes. In vivo, TAK1 is predominantly expressed in developing skeletal muscle of young mice. However, the expression of TAK1 was significantly up-regulated in regenerating skeletal muscle of adult mice.

https://openalex.org/W2079715479,"Copper-transporting ATPase ATP7B is essential for human copper homeostasis and normal liver function. ATP7B has six N-terminal metal-binding domains (MBDs) that sense cytosolic copper levels and regulate ATP7B. The mechanism of copper sensing and signal integration from multiple MBDs is poorly understood. We show that MBDs communicate and that this communication determines the oxidation state and conformation of the entire N-terminal domain of ATP7B (N-ATP7B). Mutations of copper-coordinating Cys to Ala in any MBD (2, 3, 4, or 6) change the N-ATP7B conformation and have distinct functional consequences. Mutating MBD2 or MBD3 causes Cys oxidation in other MBDs and loss of copper binding. In contrast, mutation of MBD4 and MBD6 does not alter the redox status and function of other sites. Our results suggest that MBD2 and MBD3 work together to regulate access to other metal-binding sites, whereas MBD4 and MBD6 receive copper independently, downstream of MBD2 and MBD3. Unlike Ala substitutions, the Cys-to-Ser mutation in MBD2 preserves the conformation and reduced state of N-ATP7B, suggesting that hydrogen bonds contribute to interdomain communications.

IntroductionCopper is an essential trace element used as a cofactor by numerous enzymes, which take advantage of its low redox potential to catalyze electron transfer reactions. Perhaps because of this high reactivity, copper is kept under strict homeostatic control. The copper-transporting P-type ATPases (Cu-ATPases), ATP7A and ATP7B, are essential for maintaining cellular copper levels. These transporters deliver copper into the secretory pathway for the biosynthesis of cuproenzymes and facilitate export of excess copper from the cells. In humans, mutations in either ATP7A or ATP7B disrupt copper homeostasis and lead to the severe disorders Menkes disease and Wilson disease, respectively (1.Bertini I. Rosato A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 89-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Copper is not only transported by Cu-ATPases; it also acts as a regulator of their activity, post-translational modification, and intracellular localization (2.Lutsenko S. LeShane E.S. Shinde U. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2007; 463: 134-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The mechanism of copper-dependent regulation of Cu-ATPases is poorly understood.ATP7A and ATP7B are highly homologous proteins and share many aspects of function and regulation. In this study, we focus on ATP7B. Cu-ATPase ATP7B is a 165-kDa protein with eight transmembrane segments and most of the soluble parts exposed to the cytosol. The large cytosolic N-terminal domain of ATP7B (N-ATP7B) 2The abbreviations used are: N-ATP7BN-terminal domain of ATP7BMBDmetal-binding domainMBSmetal-binding siteMBPmaltose-binding proteinTCEPtris(carboxyethyl)phosphineEXAFSextended x-ray absorption fine structureCPM7-diethylamino-3-(4′-maleimidylphenyl)-4-methylcoumarinr.m.s.d.root mean square deviation. binds copper and plays a key role in regulation of ATP7B. The intracellular copper donor metallochaperone Atox1 docks to N-ATP7B, transfers copper, and stimulates the activity of ATP7B. N-ATP7B is also phosphorylated by a kinase in response to copper binding (3.Bartee M.Y. Ralle M. Lutsenko S. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 5573-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), houses the sequence determinants for the copper-dependent apical targeting of ATP7B (4.Guo Y. Nyasae L. Braiterman L.T. Hubbard A.L. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest.

It remains unknown whether all of these copper-induced events are directly coupled. It is also unclear how many copper-binding sites in N-ATP7B participate in each regulatory event or how signals from multiple copper-binding events are integrated, if at all.N-ATP7B contains six metal-binding subdomains (MBDs), each coordinating one copper between 2 Cys residues in an invariant CxxC motif (6.Lutsenko S.

These studies revealed that all MBDs have a ferridoxin-like βαββαβ-fold, with the copper-coordinating site situated in a solvent-exposed loop between the β1-strand and α1-helix (Fig. 1B). In individual recombinant MBDs, copper binding to this loop does not induce significant changes in the structure of MBDs: the loop takes on a more fixed, rigid state (9.Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. Rosenzweig A.C. Yatsunyk L.A. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 7423-7429Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), whereas the rest of the protein shows very minor changes. However, when copper binds to N-ATP7B, significant changes in secondary structure are detected by circular dichroism and proteolysis (3.Bartee M.Y. Ralle M. Lutsenko S. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 5573-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 7.DiDonato M. Hsu H.F. Narindrasorasak S. Que Jr., L. Sarkar B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1890-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Thus, very small structural alterations in individual MBDs upon copper binding are sufficient to trigger a rearrangement of the entire N-terminal domain.The mechanism by which copper regulates the N-ATP7B conformation is not obvious because, in N-ATP7B, the copper-binding sites of MBDs appear fairly exposed. Specifically, all MBDs in N-ATP7B can be labeled with the Cys-directed fluorescent probe, although with different efficiency (16.Yatsunyk L.A. Rosenzweig A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 8622-8631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 17.Walker J.M. Huster D. Ralle M. Morgan C.T. Blackburn N.J. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15376-15384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), indicating accessibility of sites to solvent. Similarly, all six sites in N-ATP7B can be loaded with copper in the presence of Cu-Atox1 (18.Walker J.M. Tsivkovskii R. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27953-27959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Although copper exchange between individual MBDs can occur in solution (8.Achila D. Banci L. Bertini I. Bunce J. Ciofi-Baffoni S. Huffman D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 5729-5734Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), such interdomain exchange is not essential for Atox1-mediated metalation of N-ATP7B (16.Yatsunyk L.A. Rosenzweig A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 8622-8631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).The above structural data showing relative exposure of metal- binding sites (MBSs) and the lack of significant structural changes upon copper binding appear at odds with the studies showing functional coupling between MBDs. In N-ATP7B, MBD2 is the preferential site for copper transfer from Atox1, and only after MBD2 is filled can other sites be loaded with copper (18.Walker J.M. Tsivkovskii R. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27953-27959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In the context of the full-length ATP7B, the CxxC-to-AxxA substitution within MBD2 completely disrupts the activation of ATP7B by Cu-Atox1 without altering protein ability to be activated by free copper (17.Walker J.M. Huster D. Ralle M. Morgan C.T. Blackburn N.J. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15376-15384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that MBD2 may act as a gateway for Atox1-mediated copper transfer to the rest of the protein and modulate access to other N-terminal MBDs.To better understand the relationship between MBDs in the context of a fully folded N-ATP7B, we characterized the effect of mutating individual sites on copper binding by N-ATP7B. Our studies revealed the key roles of MBD2 and MBD3 in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of N- ATP7B. We observed a tight packing of MBDs within N-ATP7B that depends on the ability of the CxxC-containing loops to form hydrogen bonds and that has important functional consequences. The interdomain contacts maintain the reduced state of MBSs as well as distinct conformations of loops connecting MBDs. Our results suggest a mechanism that allows for small perturbations in structure (because of mutation or copper binding) to alter the tertiary structure of the entire N-ATP7B.DISCUSSIONWe have demonstrated that the regulatory N-terminal domain of ATP7B is arranged with the MBDs in close contact and communication with each other. The tight packing of MBDs fixes the connecting loops in distinct conformations and allows for small structural changes in individual MBDs to be transmitted to other MBDs and modify the exposure of the connecting loops. The interdomain communication appears to require hydrogen bonding, which also contributes to the maintenance of the redox status of metal-binding Cys residues. MBD2, the site of primary copper transfer from Atox1 (when the fully folded N-ATP7B is used), along with MBD3 plays a central role in maintaining the conformation and reduced state of the entire N-terminal domain.NMR and crystal structures of individual MBDs show only minor differences between the copper-bound and apo forms (8.Achila D.

Ralle M. Lutsenko S. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 5573-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 7.DiDonato M. Hsu H.F. Narindrasorasak S. Que Jr., L. Sarkar B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1890-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Our data show that, even in the apo form, MBDs are packed tightly, albeit not rigidly, together. Copper binding to the CxxC site, which causes the inward movement of the loop, making it rigid and less exposed (13.Banci L. Bertini I. Del Conte R. D'Onofrio M. Rosato A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3396-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), appears to alter the contacts between MBDs (as do the Cys-to-Ala mutations) and induces changes in the structure of loops connecting MBDs. The change in loop structures/orientations is likely to be an important event in regulating ATP7B because it may expose sites for kinase-mediated phosphorylation located within the loops (3.Bartee M.Y.

Chem. 2006; 281: 14006-14014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) while burying residues that interact with the ATP-binding domain and disrupting interdomain interactions (27.Tsivkovskii R. MacArthur B.C. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2234-2242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). It is interesting that the conformational effects of mutating different MBDs (or sequential copper binding) are not identical as evidenced by distinct and stable proteolytic patterns. This diversity of consequences may be necessary for a fined-tuned response to various concentrations of copper and may explain the poorly understood need for multiple copper-binding sites in N-ATP7B.The effect of m2A and m3A mutations on the oxidation state and copper-binding ability of other MBDs was unexpected. The drastic difference between m2A and m2S was particularly striking. These results suggest that hydrogen bonding may be required for both the precise packing and maintenance of the reduced state of N-ATP7B. The flexibility of the metal-binding loop in MBD2 could be critical for allowing communications between MBDs (and between MBD and Atox1) (see Ref. 25.Rodriguez-Granillo A. Crespo A. Wittung-Stafshede P. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 5849-5863Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It is interesting to consider that the stabilization of a Cys residue in a more extended conformation through hydrogen bonding is likely to decrease the probability of forming disulfide bonds and thus preserve the reduced state of the MBDs. This view is supported by our observation that, in wild-type N-ATP7B, MBD2 is reduced and available for Cys labeling, whereas following proteolysis (when precise contacts are disrupted), MBD2 rapidly oxidizes and cannot be labeled with CPM (supplemental Fig. 7). Our data also suggest that some Cys residues could be oxidized irreversibly (supplemental Fig. 3B), possibly to sulfinic or sulfonic acid, as has been observed for other Cys-containing metalloproteins (29.Fujiwara N. Nakano M. Kato S. Yoshihara D. Ookawara T. Eguchi H. Taniguchi N. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 35933-35944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Although this may be a by-product of our expression system, these in vitro data raise an interesting question as to how the reduced state of N-ATP7B is maintained in a cell. A previous report on a copper-dependent interaction between N-ATP7B and glutaredoxin suggests one possible reduction mechanism (30.Lim C.M. Cater M.A. Mercer J.F. La Fontaine S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 348: 428-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).It is also intriguing that the m2A and m3A mutants have a similar increase in oxidation and loss of copper binding, whereas mutating both MBDs in tandem relieves this effect (FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5B). This observation suggests that, although both MBDs play an important role in regulating the status of other MBDs, they each do not have individual downstream partners. The proteolytic pattern of the m2/3A mutant is distinct from that of either m2A or m3A (supplemental Fig. 5B). It is possible that this distinct conformation favors the “proper” orientation of the remaining MBDs, although we did not explore this further in this study. It is clear that not every change in conformation is associated with increased susceptibility to oxidation. The m6A mutant had a similar proteolysis pattern to the m2A mutant (supplemental Fig. 5A), even though it bound copper and labeled with CPM at predicted levels. This suggests that the conformational changes in loops and redox sensitivity of MBSs are related but not dependent on one another and further demonstrates the unique role MBD2 plays in regulating access to other MBSs in N-ATP7B.We attribute the changes in the proteolytic pattern of the m2A mutant to be predominantly due to the dissociation of MBD3 and MBD1 from MBD2 and exposure of additional trypsin sites that are inaccessible when the domains are packed tightly together (Fig. 1A). This is supported by the increase in tryptophan fluorescence in the mutant, which we think is likely due to the exposure of the Trp residue in the loop connecting MBD1 and MBD2. We also observed some dissociation of MBD1 and MBD2 when the digested domain was separated on a native gel (Fig. 6A). Our ab initio structures (Fig. 9) provide a clue to the potential interaction between MBD1 and MBD2. The loop connecting the two domains seems to have some inherent α-helical tendencies, which could bring the two MBDs close together, but can also unfold and increase the distance between the MBDs. Molecular dynamics simulations of apo- and Cu-Atox1, which is a structural homolog of MBDs, suggest that copper binding may increase the flexibility of the portion of the MBD opposite from the metal-binding loop, thus influencing pairing of other MBDs (28.Rodriguez-Granillo A. Wittung-Stafshede P. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2008; 112: 4583-4593Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This change could be transmitted through the loop region, imparting more structure to the loop in the copper-bound state and bringing the MBDs closer together. Previous EXAFS analysis of copper-loaded N-ATP7B consistently showed a Cu–Cu distance of 2.6 Å (24.Ralle M. Lutsenko S. Blackburn N.J. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2004; 98: 765-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), indicative of close proximity between pairs of MBSs.In summary, we have presented a working model in which close packing of N-ATP7B allows cross-talk among MBSs. This interdomain communication is necessary for maintenance of reduced cysteines and proper copper acquisition. The MBD interactions may involve a hydrogen-bonding network that allows copper binding to be translated into larger structural rearrangements via the loops between the MBDs. These rearrangements are likely to play a major role in regulating ATPase activity as well as mediating interactions with cellular trafficking machinery. Maintaining the precise interdomain contacts could also be essential for success of high resolution structural studies of N-ATP7B, which, so far, have represented a significant challenge. IntroductionCopper is an essential trace element used as a cofactor by numerous enzymes, which take advantage of its low redox potential to catalyze electron transfer reactions. Perhaps because of this high reactivity, copper is kept under strict homeostatic control. The copper-transporting P-type ATPases (Cu-ATPases), ATP7A and ATP7B, are essential for maintaining cellular copper levels. These transporters deliver copper into the secretory pathway for the biosynthesis of cuproenzymes and facilitate export of excess copper from the cells. In humans, mutations in either ATP7A or ATP7B disrupt copper homeostasis and lead to the severe disorders Menkes disease and Wilson disease, respectively (1.Bertini I. Rosato A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 89-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Copper is not only transported by Cu-ATPases; it also acts as a regulator of their activity, post-translational modification, and intracellular localization (2.Lutsenko S. LeShane E.S. Shinde U. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2007; 463: 134-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The mechanism of copper-dependent regulation of Cu-ATPases is poorly understood.ATP7A and ATP7B are highly homologous proteins and share many aspects of function and regulation. In this study, we focus on ATP7B. Cu-ATPase ATP7B is a 165-kDa protein with eight transmembrane segments and most of the soluble parts exposed to the cytosol. The large cytosolic N-terminal domain of ATP7B (N-ATP7B) 2The abbreviations used are: N-ATP7BN-terminal domain of ATP7BMBDmetal-binding domainMBSmetal-binding siteMBPmaltose-binding proteinTCEPtris(carboxyethyl)phosphineEXAFSextended x-ray absorption fine structureCPM7-diethylamino-3-(4′-maleimidylphenyl)-4-methylcoumarinr.m.s.d.root mean square deviation. binds copper and plays a key role in regulation of ATP7B. The intracellular copper donor metallochaperone Atox1 docks to N-ATP7B, transfers copper, and stimulates the activity of ATP7B. N-ATP7B is also phosphorylated by a kinase in response to copper binding (3.Bartee M.Y. Ralle M. Lutsenko S. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 5573-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), houses the sequence determinants for the copper-dependent apical targeting of ATP7B (4.Guo Y. Nyasae L. Braiterman L.T. Hubbard A.L. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2005; 289: G904-G916Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and recognizes dynactin, a component of the trafficking machinery, in a copper-dependent manner (5.Lim C.M. Cater M.A. Mercer J.F. La Fontaine S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14006-14014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). It remains unknown whether all of these copper-induced events are directly coupled. It is also unclear how many copper-binding sites in N-ATP7B participate in each regulatory event or how signals from multiple copper-binding events are integrated, if at all.N-ATP7B contains six metal-binding subdomains (MBDs), each coordinating one copper between 2 Cys residues in an invariant CxxC motif (6.Lutsenko S.

Que Jr., L. Sarkar B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1890-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The six MBDs are connected by flexible loops of varying lengths (Fig. 1A). The three-dimensional structure of N-ATP7B is unknown; however, the structures of individual subdomains and two pairs (MBD3/4 and MBD5/6) have been solved (8.Achila D. Banci L. Bertini I. Bunce J.

Biol. 1998; 5: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). These studies revealed that all MBDs have a ferridoxin-like βαββαβ-fold, with the copper-coordinating site situated in a solvent-exposed loop between the β1-strand and α1-helix (Fig. 1B). In individual recombinant MBDs, copper binding to this loop does not induce significant changes in the structure of MBDs: the loop takes on a more fixed, rigid state (9.Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. Rosenzweig A.C. Yatsunyk L.A. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 7423-7429Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), whereas the rest of the protein shows very minor changes. However, when copper binds to N-ATP7B, significant changes in secondary structure are detected by circular dichroism and proteolysis (3.Bartee M.Y. Ralle M. Lutsenko S. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 5573-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 7.DiDonato M. Hsu H.F. Narindrasorasak S. Que Jr., L. Sarkar B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1890-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Thus, very small structural alterations in individual MBDs upon copper binding are sufficient to trigger a rearrangement of the entire N-terminal domain.The mechanism by which copper regulates the N-ATP7B conformation is not obvious because, in N-ATP7B, the copper-binding sites of MBDs appear fairly exposed. Specifically, all MBDs in N-ATP7B can be labeled with the Cys-directed fluorescent probe, although with different efficiency (16.Yatsunyk L.A. Rosenzweig A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 8622-8631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 17.Walker J.M. Huster D. Ralle M. Morgan C.T. Blackburn N.J. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15376-15384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), indicating accessibility of sites to solvent. Similarly, all six sites in N-ATP7B can be loaded with copper in the presence of Cu-Atox1 (18.Walker J.M. Tsivkovskii R. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27953-27959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Although copper exchange between individual MBDs can occur in solution (8.Achila D. Banci L. Bertini I. Bunce J. Ciofi-Baffoni S. Huffman D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 5729-5734Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), such interdomain exchange is not essential for Atox1-mediated metalation of N-ATP7B (16.Yatsunyk L.A. Rosenzweig A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 8622-8631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).The above structural data showing relative exposure of metal- binding sites (MBSs) and the lack of significant structural changes upon copper binding appear at odds with the studies showing functional coupling between MBDs. In N-ATP7B, MBD2 is the preferential site for copper transfer from Atox1, and only after MBD2 is filled can other sites be loaded with copper (18.Walker J.M. Tsivkovskii R. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27953-27959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In the context of the full-length ATP7B, the CxxC-to-AxxA substitution within MBD2 completely disrupts the activation of ATP7B by Cu-Atox1 without altering protein ability to be activated by free copper (17.Walker J.M. Huster D. Ralle M. Morgan C.T. Blackburn N.J. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15376-15384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that MBD2 may act as a gateway for Atox1-mediated copper transfer to the rest of the protein and modulate access to other N-terminal MBDs.To better understand the relationship between MBDs in the context of a fully folded N-ATP7B, we characterized the effect of mutating individual sites on copper binding by N-ATP7B. Our studies revealed the key roles of MBD2 and MBD3 in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of N- ATP7B. We observed a tight packing of MBDs within N-ATP7B that depends on the ability of the CxxC-containing loops to form hydrogen bonds and that has important functional consequences. The interdomain contacts maintain the reduced state of MBSs as well as distinct conformations of loops connecting MBDs. Our results suggest a mechanism that allows for small perturbations in structure (because of mutation or copper binding) to alter the tertiary structure of the entire N-ATP7B."
https://openalex.org/W2085618038,"HDAC10 belongs to the class II histone deacetylase family; however, its functions remain enigmatic. We report here that the HDAC10 protein complex contained deacetylated chaperone protein hsc70, and HDAC10 relieved repression of melanogenesis by decreasing the repressional activity of two transcriptional regulators, paired box protein 3 (Pax3) and KRAB-associated protein 1 (KAP1). HDAC10 physically interacted with Pax3 and KAP1 in a ternary complex and maintained Pax3 and KAP1 in a deacetylated state. Deacetylated Pax3 and KAP1 derepressed promoters of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) and melanocyte-specific tyrosinase-related protein 1 and 2 (TRP-1 and TRP-2), three genes of the melanogenesis cascade, in a trichostatin A-sensitive manner. Co-occupancy of melanogenic promoters by HDAC10, Pax3, and KAP1 only happened in cells of the melanocyte lineage, and KAP1 facilitated nuclear enrichment of HDAC10. Finally, cellular melanin content correlated directly with the expression level and activity of HDAC10. Our results not only show that HDAC10 regulates melanogenesis but also demonstrate that the transcriptional activities of Pax3 and KAP1 are intimately linked to their acetylation status."

Recent evidence suggests that intracellular Zn2+ functions as a signaling molecule, mediating a variety of important physiological phenomena. However, the immediate effectors of intracellular Zn2+ signaling are not well known. We show here that intracellular Zn2+ potently and reversibly activates large-conductance voltage- and Ca2+-activated Slo1 K+ (BK) channels. The full effect of Zn2+ requires His365 in the RCK1 (regulator of conductance for K+) domain of the channel. Furthermore, mutation of two nearby acidic residues, Asp367 and Glu399, also reduced activation of the channel by Zn2+, suggesting a possible structural arrangement for Zn2+ binding by the aforementioned residues. Extracellular Zn2+ activated Slo1 BK channels when coexpressed with Zn2+-permeable TRPM7 (transient receptor potential melastatin 7) channels. The results thus demonstrate that Slo1 BK channels represent a positive and direct effector of Zn2+ signaling and may participate in sculpting cellular response to an increase in intracellular Zn2+ concentration.

In this actin polymerization assay, only (R/W)16, (R/W)9, and R9 were found active. Therefore, these latter peptides were further tested for their capability to interact with actin in vitro and in 3T3-EF fibroblasts lacking zyxin focal adhesion points and stress fibers (27.Amsellem V.

The following peptides were obtained by solid-phase synthesis (t-butoxycarbonyl strategy) as described (28.Delaroche D. Aussedat B. Aubry S. Chassaing G. Burlina F. Clodic G. Bolbach G. Lavielle S.

Thymosin β4 (Tβ4) and actin were prepared as described earlier (29.Domanski M. Hertzog M. Coutant J. Gutsche-Perelroizen I. Bontems F. Carlier M.F. Guittet E. van Heijenoort C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23637-23645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 and NIH 3T3 EF cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum (Invitrogen), penicillin (100,000 IU/liter), and streptomycin (100,000 IU/liter) (PAA Laboratories) and selected with 25 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). ITC measurements were performed on a VP-ITC system (MicroCal). Peptides solutions at 100 μm in G buffer were titrated in 10-μl injections into 1.45 ml of a 10 μm actin solution in G buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% NaN3) at 25 °C. The duration of the injections was 20 s with an interval of 4 min between two injections. Data were fitted to a one-site binding model using the MicroCal Origin software to determine the Kd values of peptide-actin association. NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker Avance 600-mHz spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm TXI cryoprobe. 1.45 mm (R/W)16 and (R/W)9 peptide stock solutions were prepared in 90% H2O, 10% D2O G buffer. NMR samples of complexes between G actin and peptides were prepared by mixing 500 μl of 50 μm G-actin in G buffer with increasing amounts of peptide stock solution. It should be noted that G-actin polymerization in G buffer is negligible at this concentration. The binding was followed by one-dimensional 1H experiments at 298 K. Water resonance was suppressed using a WATERGATE sequence. Experiments were repeated at least three times independently. Competition experiments were done between a 1:1 complex Tβ4-G-actin in which Tβ4 was uniformly 15N-labeled and (R/W)16. The Tβ4-G-actin complex was prepared by mixing 550 μl of 50 μm G-actin in G buffer with 1.5 mg of [U-15N]Tβ4 (29.Domanski M. Hertzog M. Coutant J. Gutsche-Perelroizen I. Bontems F. Carlier M.F.

A small excess of Tβ4 was added to avoid polymerization of G-actin. (R/W)16 was added into this sample at different ratios (0; 0.2; 0.4; 0.6; 0.8; 1.0; 1.2). The titration was followed through the observation of the 1H-15N resonances of Tβ4 in a 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum correlation experiment performed at 298 K. The spectra were transformed with the software NMRPipe (30.Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11443) Google Scholar) and analyzed with SPARKY (46.Goddard T.D. Kneller D.G. SPARKY 3. University of California, San Francisco, CA2007Google Scholar). Pyrene-labeled and unlabeled actin monomers (3 μm) were mixed to obtain 10% pyrene-actin in G buffer. The polymerization reaction was started by the addition of 10× KMEI (500 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA and 100 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 7) in the absence or the presence of the peptides at the indicated concentration. Kinetics of polymerization was obtained by measurement of the fluorescence signal increase related to actin-pyrene incorporation into actin polymers (31.Cooper J.A. Walker S.B. Pollard T.D. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1983; 4: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Cells (105 cells/well) were seeded on the glass coverslips coated with fibronectin (10 μg/ml) in 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% newborn calf serum. After peptide incubation for 2 or 18 h, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed for 15 min with 3% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized for 5 min with 0.4% Triton X-100 before incubation with 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline. Anti-zyxin antibody (Synaptic Systems) (1/200) was incubated with cells for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were then incubated with phalloidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate (1/1000) (Sigma) and a donkey anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated to TRITC (1/100) (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were finally incubated with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (1.5 μg/ml) (Pierce) in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min in the dark at room temperature. Coverslips were mounted in Fluoromount for observation with a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-S, objective ×60 PLANFLUOR. Cells were seeded in 8-well Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nunc) on a glass coverslip (104 cells/well) in 400 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/10% newborn calf serum. Cells were incubated with the peptide in hermetic chamber at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere (Leica). Video recordings of EF cell migration were done on glass coverslips in parallel: 3T3 cells, EF cells, EF cells in the presence eof 5 or 10 μm (R/W)16. Phase contrast photographs were taken every 4 min for 18 h with a high resolution camera (Leica). The movements of the cells were analyzed with MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging, Downingtown, PA), allowing the reconstitution of each cell track and the measurement of the motility parameters. Cells were seeded (500 cells/dish) in complete culture medium supplemented with 1% methylcellulose (Methocel MC4000, Sigma) in triplicate into 35-mm dishes. Peptides were added every 3 days to cells incubated at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. After 3 weeks, pictures of each dish were taken, and clones with a diameter >120 μm were counted. Fibroblasts were grown nearly to confluence in the absence or the presence of 10 μm peptide. A linear wound was then made with a sterile 100-μl plastic pipette tip. Cells were additionally grown for 24 h before contrast phase microscopy observation. The putative interaction of (R/W)16, (R/W)9, and R9 with G-actin was first examined by ITC. All three peptides were found to interact with G-actin but with different affinity (Fig. 1, A1). The affinity for G-actin of (R/W)16 was higher than the one of (R/W)9 (Fig. 1, A2) or R9 (not shown), with Kd values of 0.4 and ∼10 μm, respectively. The enantiomeric form of (R/W)9, containing all d-amino acids, did not interact with G-actin (not shown). The interaction of (R/W)16 and (R/W)9 with actin was also examined by NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 1B). Fig. 1, B1, presents the signal of free G-actin (in red), free (R/W)9 (in blue), and free (R/W)16 (in black). The G-actin spectrum is best described as a large envelope of broad signals with a limited number of narrower resonances possibly corresponding to more dynamic regions of the protein and/or minor low molecular weight impurities in the preparation. This broad spectrum is expected for a 42-kDa folded protein. At the opposite, narrow lines and weak spectral dispersion spectra are detected for (R/W)9 and (R/W)16, which agree with small unfolded peptides without G-actin. The signals around 10 ppm correspond to the chemical shift of side chain protons of tryptophan. We use it to follow the behavior of the peptides in the presence of G-actin. No resonances characteristic of the free peptide were detected at the early stages of the titration of a 50 μm G-actin solution with (R/W)9 and (R/W)16 (Fig. 1, B2 and B3), whereas the 1H resonances of G-actin progressively disappeared upon the addition of up to 1 eq of one or the other peptide (Fig. 1, B2 for (R/W)16 and Fig. 1, B3 for (R/W)9). First, the disappearance of G-actin resonances upon peptide addition indicates the formation of large particles that can no longer be detected by liquid state NMR. The simultaneous disappearance of the peptide resonances confirmed a direct in vitro interaction of (R/W)16 and (R/W)9 with G-actin. 1H resonances characteristic of the free peptides and corresponding to a concentration of about 1 eq of peptide arise upon the addition of the 6th and 3rd eq of (R/W)16 and (R/W)9, respectively (Fig. 1, B1 and B2). (R/W)9 thus exhibits a lower affinity and/or a lower interaction stoichiometry than (R/W)16 for actin. Finally, the binding competition of (R/W)16 with Tβ4, a known actin sequestering peptide, was evaluated by NMR 1H-15N correlation spectra of 15N-labeled Tβ4. The large dispersion of amide resonances in the bound form of 15N-labeled Tβ4 is typical of a fully structured protein, whereas at the opposite, the free-form spectrum displays poor dispersion, indicating an unfolded peptide. The 15N and 1H resonances of Tβ4 bound to G-actin were gradually displaced toward the free form upon the addition of (R/W)16 (Fig. 1, C and D). Considering that the dissociation constant of thymosin β4 for G-actin is around 0.76 μm (19.Chereau D. Kerff F. Graceffa P. Grabarek Z. Langsetmo K. Dominguez R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 16644-16649Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), the ability of (R/W)16 to completely displace at a stoichiometry of 1:1:1 this actin-binding protein from G-actin is wholly compatible with the 0.4 μm dissociation constant obtained from ITC measurements. The cooperative global unbinding of thymosin β4 upon titration by (R/W)16 indicates that the binding site of (R/W)16 covers a fraction of the extended binding site of thymosin β4 that is crucial for the binding of the whole protein, that (R/W)16 modifies the structure of G-actin in such a way that it disrupts the binding of thymosin β4, or that (R/W)16 favors actin aggregation, thus impeding thymosin β4 binding. In any case, the results clearly show a direct interaction between (R/W)16 and G-actin. Fluorescence assays with 10% pyrene-labeled actin (31.Cooper J.A. Walker S.B. Pollard T.D. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1983; 4: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) were used to evaluate whether these peptides could directly affect actin polymerization dynamics. Up to 10 μm of the (R/W)9 and R9 peptides had no significant effect in these polymerization assays (not shown), whereas (R/W)16 could speed up the rate of actin polymerization (Fig. 2A). Indeed, the slope (Δfluorescence/Δt), determined at half-polymerization, was increased in a concentration-dependent manner from 0.97 for actin alone to 2.5 in the presence of 2 μm (R/W)16. At 5 μm (R/W)16, fluorescence signal increase was abolished, and a stable plateau was observed instead that corresponded to 14 ± 2% (four independent experiments) of the plateau reached by F-actin alone. The same experiments were repeated in the presence of 0.1% (15 μm) or 1% (150 μm) bovine serum albumin (Fig. 2B), a protein with an acidic pI value similar to actin, to decipher how these effects would be influenced by nonspecific conflicting interactions. At substoichiometric concentrations, the peptide did not increase the rate of actin polymerization in the presence of BSA, although the same plateau was reached. Above stoichiometry, at the opposite, reduced fluorescence intensity was always observed with a plateau 2-fold above G-actin fluorescence. A spin-down assay (Fig. 2C) was performed that demonstrates that F-actin was also formed under these conditions and in similar amounts when compared with actin alone and thus that actin polymerization was not inhibited. Differences in pyrene quenching are the molecular basis for the actin-pyrene polymerization assay. Indeed as G-actin structure is slightly modified in the polymer, pyrene is no longer exposed to quenching by adjacent tryptophan or tyrosine amino acids in F-actin. It has been shown that under heavy meromyosin binding, pyrene-labeled F-actin exhibits fluorescence decrease to values intermediate between those of G-actin and of F-actin alone (32.Kouyama T. Mihashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). In that study, it was assessed that the binding of meromyosin to F-actin alters the local conformation of each protomer, making it similar (but not identical) to that of G-actin. (R/W)16 could influence in the same way pyrene fluorescence through binding to lower affinity sites. This quenching would not be surprising because it has been shown that pyrene could be quenched by Trp or Arg (33.Yang H. Bohne C. J. Phys. Chem. 1996; 100: 14533-14539Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 34.Encinas M.V. Lissi E.A. Photochem. Photobiol. 1986; 44: 579-585Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar), the two amino acids that compose (R/W)16. The fact that no similar quenching was observed when the peptide was added to preformed F-actin observation could simply indicate a slight conformational change of the protomer upon F-actin formation in the presence of (R/W)16. Alternatively, lower affinity binding sites (occupied above stoichiometry) could lock the structure of G-actin in a conformation that does not prevent actin polymerization but inhibits pyrene fluorescence by local environmental changes of the fluorophore in the protomer. The inhibited rate increase at substoichiometric peptide concentrations, together with the fluorescence quenching at higher concentrations, in the presence of BSA are only apparently conflicting observations. (RW)16 binds (Kd value about 20 μm) competitively to BSA, which has a similar acidic pI value as actin (5.5 versus 5.2, respectively). This binding would make the peptide available at too low concentration for influencing the polymerization kinetic. Nevertheless, the association/dissociation kinetics of the peptide to BSA could still leave the peptide in excess available for the fluorescence quenching or, alternatively, the filament formed in the presence of an excess (RW)16 would simply, because of the conformational variations of the protomer, present a reduced fluorescence. Because (R/W)16, (R/W)9, and R9 had already been reported as cell-penetrating peptides (25.Derossi D. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 2: 84-87Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 28.Delaroche D. Aussedat B. Aubry S. Chassaing G. Burlina F. Clodic G. Bolbach G. Lavielle S. Sagan S. Anal.

U.S.A. 2000; 97: 13003-13008Crossref PubMed Scopus (1403) Google Scholar), we just examined with (R/W)9 whether the internalization level was similar in 3T3 and EF cells as in CHO-K1 cells. Mass spectrometry-based quantification assays (36.Burlina F. Sagan S. Bolbach G. Chassaing G. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2005; 44: 4244-4247Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) were done in parallel in the three cell lines. A similar intracellular quantity was measured in the three cell lines (supplemental Fig. S1); about 10 pmol (about 40 μm/cell) of (R/W)9 were measured after a 75-min incubation with 250,000 cells. This value dropped down to 3 pmol (about 10 μm/cell) after 18 h, as reported (28.Delaroche D. Aussedat B. Aubry S. Chassaing G. Burlina F. Clodic G. Bolbach G. Lavielle S. Sagan S. Anal. Chem. 2007; 79: 1932-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The effect of the peptides on cell viability or membrane integrity was then measured. Only the (R/W)16 peptide was found toxic and to affect the membrane integrity at concentrations ≥20 μm (supplemental Fig. S1, only cell viability is shown). To get insight into the effect of these peptides in cells, these peptides were tested in NIH-3T3 (3T3) and NIH-3T3-EF (EF) fibroblasts (27.Amsellem V. Kryszke M.H. Hervy M. Subra F. Athman R. Leh H. Brachet-Ducos C. Auclair C. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 304: 443-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These two cell lines differ markedly in their actin organization (27.Amsellem V. Kryszke M.H. Hervy M. Subra F. Athman R. Leh H. Brachet-Ducos C. Auclair C. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 304: 443-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). 3T3 fibroblasts have a star-flattened shape due to an organized actin filament network with thick stress fibers (Fig. 3). In these cells, zyxin is localized at focal adhesions and cell-to-cell contact points. On the other hand, 3T3 fibroblasts transformed with the EWS-FLI1 oncoprotein exhibit a complete disruption of their actin cytoskeleton, retaining very few stress fibers, focal adhesions, and cell-to-cell contacts (Fig. 3). In addition, zyxin is expressed at very low levels and remains diffusely distributed throughout the cytoplasm (27.Amsellem V. Kryszke M.H. Hervy M. Subra F. Athman R. Leh H. Brachet-Ducos C. Auclair C. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 304: 443-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Actin is predominantly diffused in the cytosol or bundled in lamellipodia. In addition, EF cells are characterized by a loss of cell-cell contacts, a cell polarization, and an increase in the cell motility. Finally, zyxin is underexpressed in EF cells when compared with 3T3 cells (27.Amsellem V. Kryszke M.H. Hervy M. Subra F. Athman R. Leh H. Brachet-Ducos C. Auclair C. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 304: 443-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Peptides were incubated at 10 μm for 18–24 h with EF cells before fixation and labeling of actin (phalloidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate), zyxin (monoclonal antibody, secondary antibody-TRITC), and the nuclei (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) before epifluorescence microscopy analysis (Fig. 4). The experiments were reproduced five times independently and always gave the same results. (R/W)16, (R/W)9, and R9 could induce stress fiber reorganization in EF cells (Fig. 3), whereas their potential effect in 3T3 cells was not visible (not shown). In addition, cell-cell contacts were re-established in the presence of these peptides in EF when compared with control 3T3 and EF cells (Fig. 3). The effect of the enantiomeric form of (R/W)9, containing all d-amino acids, was assayed in the same conditions. Although internalized in cells (not shown) without inducing cytotoxicity (supplemental Fig. S1), the d-amino acids containing peptide had no effect on actin organization in 3T3 and EF cells (Fig. 3). To define in a more quantitative manner the observation of the peptide-induced stress fiber formation made by fluorescence microscopy, different classes of cells according to their morphology were distinguished (Fig. 4). Cells resembling non-tumoral ones, with a star-flattened shape, actin cytoskeleton organized as stress fibers connected to the cell junctions, and zyxin localization at focal adhesion points, were classified as non-tumoral (N) cells. Cells with a rounded shape, actin bundles in lamellipodia, or diffuse actin and zyxin in the cytosol were classified as tumoral (T) cells. Remaining cells with an undefined shape with few cell-cell contacts, small stress fibers, and no zyxin specific localization were difficult to grade and described as undetermined (ND) cells. The non-tumoral cells were the major class for 3T3 cells, whereas the tumoral class best defined the EF cells (Fig. 4). After an 18–24-h incubation with 10 μm peptides, the repartition of the cells between the three classes was similar for (R/W)16, (R/W)9, and R9 (Fig. 4). When compared with the tumoral class, the non-tumoral class became major in the EF population incubated with the peptides (Fig. 4). About 35–40% of EF cells were ranked in the undetermined class. Similar results were obtained in the presence of jasplakinolide, although the undetermined class was much less populated than for the cell-penetrating peptides. Similar results were also obtained after a 2-h incubation instead of an 18-h incubation of the EF cells with the peptides. By contrast, the enantiomeric analogue (all d-amino acids) of the (R/W)9 peptide did not have any visible effect in these tumoral cells. Finally, the effects of the peptides (10 μm) on actin organization in 3T3 cells were not morphologically perceptible (Fig. 4). Therefore, the three peptides were effective (via a chiral recognition) to induce actin stress fibers, cell-cell contacts, and partial zyxin relocalization at focal adhesion points in tumoral EF cells. An increased motility associated with the absence of actin cytoskeleton organization and actin polymerization has been described for EF cells (27.Amsellem V. Kryszke M.H. Hervy M. Subra F. Athman R.

We found more than 400 proteins, including proteins with previously known acidic phospholipid-binding properties, and confirmed that several candidates, such as Coronin 1A, mDia1 (Diaphanous-related formin-1), PIR121/CYFIP2, EB2 (end plus binding protein-2), KIF21A (kinesin family member 21A), eEF1A1 (translation elongation factor 1α1), and TRIM2, directly bind to acidic phospholipids. Among such novel proteins, we provide evidence that Coronin 1A activity, which disassembles Arp2/3-containing actin filament branches, is spatially and temporally regulated by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2). Whereas Coronin 1A co-localizes with PI(4,5)P2 at the plasma membrane in resting cells, it is dissociated from the plasma membrane during lamellipodia formation where the PI(4,5)P2 signal is significantly reduced.

Janmey P.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 761-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 6.Yonezawa N. Nishida E. Iida K. Yahara I. Sakai H. J. Biol.

In vitro and structural studies showed that actin-binding sites of these ABPs are overlapped with PI(4,5)P2-binding sites and that the activity of ABPs is inhibited by PI(4,5)P2 (6.Yonezawa N.

Therefore, the activity of ABPs have thought to be inhibited by PI(4,5)P2 binding that occludes F-actin-binding sites and to be activated by PI(4,5)P2 hydrolysis when phospholipase C (PLC) is activated by receptor stimulation (5.Yin H.L. Janmey P.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 761-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Indeed, recent in vivo study have reported that Cofilin, an actin-severing protein, is inactivated at the plasma membrane in complex with PI(4,5)P2 instead of F-actin in resting cells (9.van Rheenen J.

Although most of lipid-binding domains and proteins have been mainly discovered by the functional analyses, a comprehensive identification of lipid-binding proteins using proteomic analysis may be an ideal approach to identify not only novel but unexpected lipid-binding proteins. Here, we have performed a proteomics approach using nano-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry combined with a liposome co-sedimentation method to identify potential acidic phospholipid-binding protein candidates from rat brain extracts. We identify more than 400 proteins, including several important proteins, such as Coronin 1A, mDia1 (Diaphanous-related formin-1), PIR121/CYFIP2, EB2 (end plus binding protein-2), KIF21A (kinesin family member 21A), eEF1A1 (translation elongation factor 1α1), and TRIM2 (tripartite RING finger protein), that bind directly to acidic phospholipids. Among such novel proteins, we investigate the role of lipid interaction by Coronin 1A. Coronins are actin-binding proteins involved in phagocytosis, chemotaxis, immune function, and lamellipodia formation (10.Uetrecht A.C. Bear J.E.

Coronin is believed to be a key regulator that contributes to actin disassembly (11.Brieher W.M. Kueh H.Y. Ballif B.A. Mitchison T.J. J.

Cell. 2009; 34: 364-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Together, it has been proposed that Coronin 1B promotes actin disassembly via coordination between the activities of Arp2/3 complex and Cofilin for lamellipodia formation (13.Cai L. Marshall T.W. Uetrecht A.C. Schafer D.A. Bear J.E. Cell. 2007; 128: 915-929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Moreover, Coronin 1B disassembles the Arp2/3 complex from actin filament branches and promotes the turnover of actin networks in lamellipodia (14.Cai L. Makhov A.M. Schafer D.A. Bear J.E. Cell. 2008; 134: 828-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms of how the actin disassembly by Coronins is regulated are poor understood. In this study, we provide evidence that Coronin 1A activity is spatially and temporally regulated by PI(4,5)P2. Phospholipids were purchased as follows: PE, PC, cholesterol, and PS were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids; phosphatidic acid and acidic lipids (Folch fraction 1) were obtained from Sigma; phosphoinositides were from Cell Signaling Technology; ionomycin, U73122, U73343, and rapamycin were from Sigma; mouse anti-hemagglutinin antibody was from Cell Signaling; Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated secondary antibody and Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated phalloidin were from Invitrogen; and rhodamine-conjugated actin was from Cytoskeleton. Rat brain extracts were obtained by homogenization using buffer A (50 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl). After centrifugation at 600 × g to remove intact cells and nuclei, the extracts were centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C in a TL100 rotor (Beckman) to obtain supernatants (cytosol fraction). The resulting pellets were resuspended with a high salt buffer (50 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 1 m NaCl) and centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 1 h. Obtained supernatants (membrane fraction) were dialyzed with buffer A overnight. The proteins in each gel slice were digested into peptides and extracted from the gel piece as described previously (18.Oyama M. Itagaki C. Hata H. Suzuki Y. Izumi T. Natsume T. Isobe T. Sugano S. Genome Res. 2004; 14: 2048-2052Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). After application of the peptide mixture to a C-18 column (800 μm inner diameter × 3 mm long), reversed phase separation of the captured peptides was done on a column (150 μm inner diameter × 75 mm long) filled with HiQ sil C18 (3-μm particles, 120-Å pores, KYA Technologies) using a direct nanoflow liquid chromatography system (Dina, KYA Technologies). The peptides were eluted with a linear gradient of acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid over 110 min at a flow rate of 200 nl/min and sprayed into a quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometer (Q-Tof-2, Micromass), according to the previous report (19.Oyama M. Kozuka-Hata H. Suzuki Y. Semba K. Yamamoto T. Sugano S. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2007; 6: 1000-1006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The tandem mass spectrometry signals were converted to text files using MassLynx (version 3.5, Micromass) and processed against the RefSeq (NCBI) rat protein data base (35,936 sequences; as of April 2, 2007) using the Mascot algorithm (version 2.2.04, Matrix Science) with the following parameters: variable modifications, oxidation (Met), N-acetylation, pyroglutamination (Gln); maximum missed cleavages, 1; peptide mass tolerance, 500 ppm; tandem mass spectrometry tolerance, 0.5 Da. Protein identification was based on the criteria of at least one tandem mass spectrometry data with Mascot scores that exceeded the thresholds (p < 0.05). Human Coronin 1A, PIR121 (1–200, 1–400, and 1–600 amino acids), the tail domain of KIF21A (1325–1674 amino acids), EB2, eEF1A1, TRIM2, and mouse mDia1 (66–570 and 744–1255 amino acids) were obtained by reverse transcription-PCR. These sequences were verified and subcloned into pGEX 6P-1 and -3 (GE Healthcare). Coronin 1A were also subcloned into humanized monomeric Azami Green vector (AG; MBL). pCMV-HA 2×PLCδ1 PH domain was prepared as described previously (20.Oikawa T. Itoh T. Takenawa T. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 157-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and was subcloned into monomeric tag red fluorescent protein vector (Evrogen) and pGFP C-1 vector (Clontech). pGEX-VCA of N-WASP was described previously (21.Park S.J. Suetsugu S. Sagara H. Takenawa T. Genes Cells. 2007; 12: 611-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). PM-FRB-CFP and mRFP-FKBP-5-ptase domain were provided by T. Balla (NICHD, Bethesda, MD). Mutagenesis was performed by PCR with mutated primers. GST fusion proteins were expressed in BL21 pLys strain and were purified using standard protocols. The GST tag of Coronin 1A was removed by PreScission Protease (GE Healthcare). Other GST fusion proteins were eluted by glutathione and dialyzed. Liposome co-sedimentation assay was performed as described previously (22.Tsujita K. Suetsugu S. Sasaki N. Furutani M. Oikawa T. Takenawa T. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Acidic lipids (total bovine brain lipids (Folch fraction 1; Sigma)) were suspended at 1 mg/ml in a binding buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), and liposomes were formed by vortex or sonication followed by hydration. Purified proteins (5 μg) were incubated with liposomes for 15 min at room temperature and were centrifuged at 60,000 rpm for 20 min at 25 °C in the TL100 rotor. Obtained supernatants and pellets were subject to SDS-PAGE, and the gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Liposomes with a defined maximum diameter were made by extrusion of liposomes through polycarbonate filter membranes (Avanti Polar Lipids). The F-actin co-sedimentation assay was performed as described previously (21.Park S.J. Suetsugu S. Sagara H. Takenawa T. Genes Cells. 2007; 12: 611-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). COS-1 cells and B16 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Transfection was performed using Lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For live cell imaging, cells were grown on poly-l-lysine-coated 35-mm glass bottom dishes and imaged at room temperature. Fluorescent images were taken through a microscope with a confocal microscopy system (FV1000, Olympus). Actin branching assay with total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy was performed as described previously (23.Amann K.J. Pollard T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 15009-15013Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Briefly, glass coverslips were incubated with 0.2 mg/ml N-ethylmaleimide-inactivated myosin to allow actin filament binding. Formation of actin branches was initiated in the presence of 0.8 μm actin (40% rhodamine-labeled), 25 nm Arp2/3 complex (21.Park S.J. Suetsugu S. Sagara H. Takenawa T. Genes Cells. 2007; 12: 611-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and 25 nm GST-VCA in freshly prepared TIRF buffer (20 mm imidazole, 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 30 mm glucose, 400 μm ATP, 40 μg/ml catalase, and 200 μg/ml glucose oxidase). The images were acquired for 20 min at 30-s intervals with a TIRF microscopy system (Olympus) and analyzed using the MetaMorph software. PI(4,5)P2 liposome-bound Coronin 1A was prepared by incubating purified Coronin 1A with 100 μm liposomes containing 10% PI(4,5)P2 for 10 min; ∼80% of Coronin 1A bound to PI(4,5)P2 liposomes (Fig. 3). To better understand the role of acidic phospholipids with respect to the lipid-protein interactions, we conducted a proteomics analysis and comprehensively identified proteins that selectively interact with acidic phospholipids. To isolate acidic phospholipid-binding proteins, rat brain cytosol (0.1 m NaCl extracts) and membrane fractions (high salt extracts, 1 m NaCl) were prepared and subjected to a co-sedimentation method using liposomes made of acidic phospholipid fractions from bovine brain (acidic liposomes). In our initial trials, we encountered problems such as nonspecific sedimentation of proteins because of significant affinities to neutral phospholipids and protein aggregation during the incubation step. To overcome this problem, rat extracts were initially incubated with “neutral liposomes” composed of PE and PC instead of acidic liposomes (Fig. 1A) and then centrifuged. As expected, Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining revealed a large amount of proteins that precipitated with the neutral liposomes after centrifugation (Fig. 1B). Thus, we repeated this preclearance step three times to eliminate the nonspecific sedimentations before incubating with acidic liposomes (Fig. 1B). Thereafter, a significant amount of proteins specifically precipitated with acidic liposomes as compared with neutral liposomes (Fig. 1B). Subsequently, these fractions were subjected to nano-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for protein identification. Our analysis revealed more than 400 proteins from the cytosol and 300 proteins from the membrane fraction (supplemental Tables S1 and S2). Interestingly, many of these proteins, such as those involved in transcription, translation, and in the ubiquitin pathway, have not been identified as having membrane-associated functions thus far (Fig. 2A). Moreover, many previously identified proteins included those containing already established phospholipid-binding domains, such as C2, PH, Fab1, YOTB, Vac1, EEA1, Phox homology, epsin N-terminal homology, Bin/amphiphysin/Rvs, and F-BAR/EFC, and some proteins such as dynamins and EHD (Eps15 homology domain)-containing proteins that are known to oligomerize on acidic membranes (supplemental Table S3), supporting the validity of our approach. The newly found potential acidic phospholipid-binding protein candidates were summarized according to their suggested functions (supplemental Table S4). We subsequently selected several proteins and checked their ability to bind acidic phospholipids (Fig. 2B). It was revealed that Coronin 1A, PIR121/CYFIP2, and mDia1 (Diaphanous-related formin-1), all of which play important roles in dynamic actin-remodeling events, directly bound to acidic liposomes but not to neutral liposomes (Fig. 2C). Deletion experiments narrowed down the lipid-binding site to the Rac-binding domain in PIR121 and a region covering both the formin homology-2 domain and the donor-acceptor-donor motif in mDia1 (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B). In addition, it was found that two microtubule-associated proteins, end plus binding protein-2 (EB2) and KIF21A (kinesin family member 21A), have significant affinities for acidic liposomes (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, translation eEF1A1 (elongation factor 1α1) exhibited significant binding affinities to acidic liposomes (Fig. 2C). TRIM2, a ring finger-containing ubiquitin ligase (24.Balastik M. Ferraguti F. Pires-da Silva A. Lee T.H. Alvarez-Bolado G. Lu K.P. Gruss P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 12016-12021Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), also bound specifically to acidic liposomes (Fig. 2C).FIGURE 2Identification of acidic phospholipid-binding proteins.A, classification of identified proteins (total number of proteins: cytosol fraction = 408; membrane fraction = 331). B, domain structures of new acidic phospholipid-binding proteins. C, liposome co-sedimentation assay. Proteins (5 μg) were incubated with synthetic PE/PC liposomes or acidic liposomes. Concentrations of lipids used for each proteins were as follows: Coronin 1A (0.2 mg/ml); PIR121 (0.5 mg/ml); mDia1 (0.5 mg/ml); KIF21A (0.5 mg/ml); EB2 (0.8 mg/ml); eEF1A (0.8 mg/ml); TRIM2 (0.4 mg/ml). After centrifugation, the supernatant (S) and the pellet (P) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. aa, amino acids.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The strong interaction of Coronin 1A with acidic phospholipids (Fig. 2C) prompted us to investigate the role of this actin regulatory protein with respect to its phospholipid-binding function. First, we tested whether Coronin 1A shows curvature-dependent binding because it was found that Coronin 1A bound to large multilamellar vesicles (vortexed liposomes) but not small unilamellar vesicles (sonicated liposomes) (data not shown). Indeed, Coronin 1A exhibited high affinity for low curvature liposomes with diameters larger than 200 nm (Fig. 3, A and B), consistent with the fact that Coronin 1A is localized at the plasma membrane (25.Gatfield J. Albrecht I. Zanolari B. Steinmetz M.O. Pieters J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2786-2798Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Next, on phospholipid specificity analysis, it was revealed that Coronin 1A preferentially bound to PI(4,5)P2 but not to other acidic phospholipids such as phosphatidic acid, PS, and phosphatidylinositol (PI) (Fig. 3, C and D). Among the poly-phosphorylated phosphoinositides, Coronin 1A exhibited the highest affinity for PI(4,5)P2, whereas other D5-phosphorylated poly-phosphorylated phosphoinositides such as PI(3,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 were also preferred (supplemental Fig. S2A). It is well known that both PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 can target their binding proteins to the plasma membrane; however, the concentration of PI(3,4,5)P3 is considerably lower than that of PI(4,5)P2 in resting cells. Thus, we examined in COS-1 cells whether the plasma membrane localization of Coronin 1A is mediated by an interaction with PI(4,5)P2. The elimination of PI(4,5)P2 by the treatment with ionomycin, a Ca2+ ionophore and a potent activator of PLCs (26.Várnai P. Balla T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar), resulted in the dissociation of AG-fused Coronin 1A from the plasma membrane (supplemental Fig. S3A and supplemental Video 1). Interestingly, the elimination of PI(4,5)P2 by activation of PLC resulted in membrane protrusion, in which Coronin 1A was subsequently localized (supplemental Fig. S3A). By contrast, inhibition of PI(3,4,5)P3 production by treatment with LY294002, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, did not alter AG-Coronin 1A localization (data not shown). In addition, AG-Coronin 1A showed a marked co-localization with HA-2×PLCδ1 PH domain, a specific marker for PI(4,5)P2, thus suggesting the possibility of plasma membrane interactions (Fig. 3E). Moreover, treatment with a PLC inhibitor, U73122, enhanced localization of AG-Coronin 1A at the plasma membrane, whereas a control reagent, U73343, did not (supplemental Fig. S3B). These data demonstrate that Coronin 1A localizes to the plasma membrane via PI(4,5)P2 binding. We next predicted that like Cofilin (7.Gorbatyuk V.Y. Nosworthy N.J. Robson S.A. Bains N.P. Maciejewski M.W. Dos Remedios C.G. King G.F. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 511-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), the lipid-binding site of Coronin 1A overlaps with the F-actin-binding site. To test this possibility, we mutated Arg-29 of Coronin 1A on the basis of a previously established finding that Arg-30 in Coronin 1B, which is a closely related isoform of Coronin 1A, is necessary for F-actin binding (27.Cai L. Makhov A.M. Bear J.E. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 1779-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). As expected, it was found that R29E mutation of Coronin 1A led to a simultaneous reduction of both F-actin- and lipid-binding abilities (Fig. 3F and supplemental Fig. S2B). Another mutant of Coronin 1A (Coronin 1A ΔCC), which lacks the coiled-coil region and has been predicted to lose its F-actin binding (27.Cai L. Makhov A.M. Bear J.E. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 1779-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), similarly showed reduced lipid-binding abilities (supplemental Fig. S2C). In this case, the coiled-coil region alone showed no affinity for liposomes (data not shown), indicating that the association of Coronin 1A with the membrane is enhanced by oligomerization. A more recent study has demonstrated that Coronin 1B retains the ability to disassemble Arp2/3-containing actin filament branches and thus promotes their turnover for efficient lamellipodia formation (14.Cai L. Makhov A.M. Schafer D.A. Bear J.E. Cell. 2008; 134: 828-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Although it is highly probable that this activity is strictly regulated in vivo, the precise mechanism remains poorly understood. We hypothesized that, like other ABPs such as Cofilin and Profilin (5.Yin H.L. Janmey P.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 761-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar), binding to PI(4,5)P2 regulated the activity of Coronin 1A. To address this hypothesis, we first examined the localizations of Coronin 1A and PI(4,5)P2 at the plasma membrane. We used a rapamycin-inducible system to reduce the PI(4,5)P2 level at the plasma membrane, which utilizes rapamycin-induced heterodimerization of the membrane-targeted FRB domain and the FKBP12-tagged-5-ptase domain (28.Varnai P. Thyagarajan B. Rohacs T. Balla T. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 29.Suh B.C. Inoue T. Meyer T. Hille B. Science. 2006; 314: 1454-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Upon addition of rapamycin, rapid reduction of PI(4,5)P2 and concurrent formation of membrane protrusion were observed (Fig. 4A and supplemental Video 2), consistent with a recent finding that PLC-dependent PI(4,5)P2 hydrolysis induced lamellipodia formation (9.van Rheenen J. Song X. van Roosmalen W. Cammer M. Chen X. Desmarais V. Yip S.C. Backer J.M. Eddy R.J. Condeelis J.S. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 1247-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). This treatment again induced a translocation of Coronin 1A to the extending lamellipodia (Fig. 4B and supplemental Video 3). These observations suggest that Coronin 1A may be activated on PI(4,5)P2 reduction and may subsequently promote lamellipodia formation to which it will localize. We further investigated whether the actin branch disassembling activity of Coronin 1A, which is important for rapid turnover of actin network thus efficient lamellipodia formation, is modulated by PI(4,5)P2. TIRF microscopy was used to visualize the branch formation of rhodamine-labeled actin in live observations (14.Cai L. Makhov A.M. Schafer D.A. Bear J.E. Cell. 2008; 134: 828-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 23.Amann K.J. Pollard T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 15009-15013Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). As expected, in the presence of Arp2/3 and its activator, the VCA region of N-WASP, extensive actin branch formation was observed (Fig. 5, A and B, and supplemental Video 4). Addition of Coronin 1A resulted in a smaller number of branches, indicating a strong disassembling activity (Fig. 5, A and B, and supplemental Video 5). Importantly, further addition of PI(4,5)P2 to the system effectively reversed the branch disassembly, resulting in similar branch numbers as the control (Fig. 5, A and B, and supplemental Video 6). PI(4,5)P2 by itself did not promote or inhibit actin branching (Fig. 5, A and B, and supplemental Video 7). These data suggest that the actin branch disassembling activity of Coronin 1A is regulated by a competitive mechanism, in which the F-actin-binding ability of Coronin 1A is hampered by PI(4,5)P2, because these binding sites are overlapped (Fig. 3F and supplemental Fig. S2B). Our powerful proteomics approach reveals that Coronin 1A, the critical regulator of branched actin network, is a novel phosphoinositide-binding protein. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that the both lipid and protein binding may be required for the plasma membrane localization of Coronin 1A, it was suggested that Coronin 1A binds directly to PI(4,5)P2 at the plasma membrane as observed in vitro (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, the reduction of PI(4,5)P2 caused the release of Coronin 1A from the plasma membrane in vivo (Fig. 4B and supplemental Fig. S3A). In addition, time lapse observation with TIRF microscopy reveals that the ability of Coronin 1A, which inhibits Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin branching, is antagonized by PI(4,5)P2 liposomes. These data indicate that the spatiotemporal regulation of Coronin 1A is achieved by PI(4,5)P2. A recent study has reported that Coronin 1B coordinates the activities of Arp2/3 complex and cofilin by recruiting Slingshot, which dephosphorylates and thus activates cofilin (13.Cai L. Marshall T.W. Uetrecht A.C. Schafer D.A. Bear J.E. Cell. 2007; 128: 915-929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In addition, Cofilin is inactivated at the plasma membrane by binding to PI(4,5)P2 (9.van Rheenen J. Song X. van Roosmalen W. Cammer M. Chen X. Desmarais V. Yip S.C. Backer J.M. Eddy R.J.

In light of these findings, we propose a plausible mechanism to explain how the cooperated activities of these two actin-depolymerizing factors are spatially and temporally regulated by PI(4,5)P2 (Fig. 5C). In this model, Coronin 1A localizes to the plasma membrane in resting cells together with Cofilin where they bind to PI(4,5)P2 and are therefore inactivated. This model is also supported by a recent study suggesting that a constitutive targeting of Coronin 1B to the plasma membrane strongly enhances its phosphorylation (14.Cai L. Makhov A.M. Schafer D.A. Bear J.E. Cell. 2008; 134: 828-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), which negatively regulates Coronin activity by reducing its affinity for the Arp2/3 complex (12.Föger N. Rangell L. Danilenko D.M. Chan A.C. Science. 2006; 313: 839-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 30.Cai L. Holoweckyj N. Schaller M.D. Bear J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31913-31923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Upon growth factor stimulation, activated PLC hydrolyzes PI(4,5)P2, thus inducing Coronin 1A and Cofilin translocations from the plasma membrane to the F-actin compartment of lamellipodia, where these molecules will be dephosphorylated by Slingshot. Consequently, this would enable them to promote actin branches disassembly spatially and temporally in a coordinated fashion between Arp2/3 complex dissociation and F-actin severance (Fig. 5C). In addition, Coronin 1A has been reported to form a complex with PLCγ1 and was implicated in Ca2+ mobilization (15.Mueller P. Massner J. Jayachandran R. Combaluzier B. Albrecht I. Gatfield J. Blum C. Ceredig R. Rodewald H.R. Rolink A.G. Pieters J. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that Coronin 1A might locally modulate inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate generation by connecting PLC to its substrate, PI(4,5)P2. Our proteomics identified more than 400 proteins that were precipitated with acidic phospholipids. Unexpectedly, we also noted that some typical acidic phospholipid-binding proteins like PLCδ1 were not found in the co-precipitated fractions. About 90 of the identified proteins are known acidic phospholipid-binding proteins or those with known acidic phospholipid-binding domains, such as PH, confirming the validity of our method. However, it should be noted that some proteins could be identified as results of nonspecific interactions with acidic phospholipids via merely their positively charged surfaces. In addition, it is difficult to discriminate between proteins that directly bind to acidic phospholipids and those in complex with such lipid-binding proteins. However, we believe that our proteomics data will be valuable tools as a useful and comprehensive list of potential acidic phospholipid-binding protein candidates for further validation of their lipid-binding abilities and biological significance. Our proteomics approach revealed important cytoskeletal regulators such as mDia1, PIR121/CYFIP2, and EB2 to be new acidic phospholipid-binding proteins (Fig. 2C). In addition, KIF21A may recognize its cargo by interacting with acidic phospholipids in a manner that is similar to the mechanism reported for Unc104 (31.Klopfenstein D.R. Tomishige M. Stuurman N. Vale R.D. Cell. 2002; 109: 347-358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Moreover, interaction of eEF1A1 with acidic phospholipids is intriguing given its proposed function in local translation (32.Liu G. Grant W.M. Persky D. Latham Jr., V.M. Singer R.H. Condeelis J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 579-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In this regard, PIR121/CYFIP2 is thought to be probably involved in not only the WAVE complex actin nucleation machinery (33.Eden S. Rohatgi R. Podtelejnikov A.V. Mann M. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 2002; 418: 790-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar) but also in the translation machinery, because Sra1/CYFIP1, an isoform of PIR121 (identified by our analysis [Table S4]), has been implicated in this process (34.Napoli I.

IntroductionGating is a fundamental property of all ion and solute channels, and of some transporters, and involves structural transitions that convert the protein from a nonconducting to a conducting state. Channel gating is controlled by specific stimuli, such as transmembrane voltage, a chemical ligand, or a mechanical signal (1.Kung C. Nature. 2005; 436: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), and the coupling between the signal recognition and gating is a major focus of current channel research. Channel activation is frequently rapid, often complex, and may involve multiple states either as unstable intermediates or as well defined stable conformations (2.Shapovalov G. Lester H.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 124: 151-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Channels may be required to respond to more than one signal and/or participate in adaptation processes, where they cease to conduct despite the continued exposure to the gating stimulus (3.Akitake B. Anishkin A. Sukharev S. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 125: 143-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 4.Martinac B. Buechner M. Delcour A.H. Adler J. Kung C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1987; 84: 2297-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). It is, therefore, necessary to detect gating under multiple conditions to understand channel mechanism and function. Patch clamp techniques, which measure the core properties of the channel signal sensitivity, conductance, open dwell time, selectivity, and adaptation, have become a major means to study channels in the membrane. However, this technology requires the channel to be ion-conducting and thus, cannot inform on structural conformations of the nonconducting states.Our understanding of protein conformational changes has been greatly facilitated by biophysical measurements of both native and mutant proteins. In particular, fluorescent probes have proved invaluable complements to spin probes in EPR and related techniques. Tryptophan exhibits natural fluorescence that is very sensitive to environmental changes (5.Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 3rd Ed. Springer, New York2006: 530-577Google Scholar). The peak position in the emission spectrum reflects the polarity of the immediate environment of the Trp residue, quenching by small water-soluble agents is a measure of the accessibility of the residue to the bulk water phase and anisotropy indicates the mobility of the Trp residue. Trp is a rare amino acid in proteins, and its role is often structural. Introduction of Trp is potentially disruptive to the structure of the protein because of its bulky side chain, but although it is the largest natural amino acid, it is small for a fluorophore, particularly when compared with spin labels usually used for EPR spectroscopy. Importantly, the Trp aromatic group is more closely attached to the backbone than is either a spin probe or other fluorophores, which are connected through an engineered Cys residue (see Fig. 1a). The danger for modified residues to “snorkel” into environments moderately remote from their backbone attachment site is significant. Consequently, because Trp fluorescence reports local changes in conformation of the protein, an understanding of the potential of this reporter is important, which we have investigated here in the small mechanosensitive channel, MscS.MscS responds to increases in tension in the membrane bilayer arising from sudden osmotic transitions (hypoosmotic shock). It can also be triggered to open by the insertion of amphipaths or lysophospholipids (e.g. lysophosphatidyl choline, LPC) 2The abbreviations used are: LPClysophosphatidylcholineDOPC1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholineDOPE1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamineDDMn-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranosideFRETFörster resonance energy transferPOPG1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1′-sn-glycerol)QYquantum yieldTMtransmembrane helix. into the membrane bilayer (6.Martinac B.

Physiol. 2004; 124: 151-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and results in the closed channel transitioning to an open state that conducts the passage of small solutes, which releases the tension in the membrane by lowering the osmotic gradient that drives water entry (9.Berrier C. Coulombe A. Szabo I. Zoratti M. Ghazi A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 559-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The structural organization of MscS is known through two complementary crystal structures: the wild type in a nonconducting state and a mutant, A106V, in an open state (10.Bass R.B. Strop P. Barclay M. Rees D.C. Science. 2002; 298: 1582-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 11.Steinbacher S. Bass R. Strop P. Rees D.C. Curr. Top.

Science. 2008; 321: 1179-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). MscS is a homoheptamer of 31-kDa subunits twisted around the central axis of the pore (Fig. 1b). Each subunit contributes three transmembrane helices (TM1–3). TM1 and TM2 form a paddle that is believed to sense the membrane tension; the TM3a helix lines the pore and TM3b, which lies along the membrane surface tangential to the axis of the pore, forms a resistor (12.Wang W. Black S.S. Edwards M.D. Miller S. Morrison E.L. Bartlett W. Dong C. Naismith J.H. Booth I.R. Science. 2008; 321: 1179-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The overall character of the pore is hydrophobic and residues Leu105 and Leu109 at the lower (cytoplasmic) end of the pore create a hydrophobic seal (10.Bass R.B. Strop P. Barclay M. Rees D.C. Science. 2002; 298: 1582-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 13.Anishkin A. Sukharev S. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 2883-2895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). We have proposed that the structural transition from closed to open involves the rotation and radial movement of the TM3a helices, and Ala106 is a critical residue due to its location at the interhelix interface, where, in the closed state, it interacts with Gly108 on the adjacent pore helix (14.Edwards M.D. Li Y. Kim S. Miller S. Bartlett W. Black S. Dennison S. Iscla I. Blount P. Bowie J.U. Booth I.R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Ala106 was mutated to valine, and this protein variant was found to crystallize in an open state of MscS (12.Wang W. Black S.S. Edwards M.D. Miller S. Morrison E.L. Bartlett W. Dong C. Naismith J.H. Booth I.R. Science. 2008; 321: 1179-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In this structure, Val106 is positioned in an open pocket created by rotation of the TM helices and their radial movement. The mutated residue is not conformationally constrained in the crystal structure. The A106V mutant channel retains function but requires greater pressure to open, and at least two open states are detected by application of increased pressure in patch clamp analysis (14.Edwards M.D. Li Y. Kim S. Miller S. Bartlett W. Black S. Dennison S. Iscla I. Blount P. Bowie J.U. Booth I.R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The current study was undertaken to determine whether Trp substitutions in the pore region could be used to monitor structural transitions associated with either mutation (A106V) or perturbation of the MscS-containing detergent micelles by lipids or LPC.DISCUSSIONCrystal structures of membrane proteins are often difficult to obtain and are almost exclusively not embedded into the natural lipid bilayer. This leads to unanswered mechanistic questions, even when multiple structures are available, as is the case for MscS. Ultimately, dynamic information is required that provides insights not only into the relevance of the crystal states but also into the potential conformational pathways undertaken during channel gating. Clues emerge from electrophysiology, but these are restricted to open and subconducting states. We show here that a Trp probe introduced within the pore of a channel can be used as a gating probe applying fluorescence spectroscopy.Replacing Leu105, which is one of the key seal residues in the pore of MscS, with Trp resulted in a functional and stable MscS complex. In the nonconducting (Ala106) crystal structure, the Leu residues are tightly packed, and it was a surprise that the protein tolerated the Trp substitution at this position, as introduction of Trp increases the volume by 72 Å3 per subunit (35.Richards F.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1977; 6: 151-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2323) Google Scholar). The L105W protein was clearly able to pack the Trp residues and attain a stable conformation as it could be solubilized by detergent and retained its heptameric structure. This is in contrast to L109W, which was expressed, integrated into the membrane and was functional but was unstable after detergent solubilization. The L105W substitution causes disruption of the open state, because stable openings were not observed in patch-clamp analysis. Steric hindrance caused by the Trp side chains may explain this observation, as in the Val106 (i.e. more open) structure the Leu105 side chains are separated by only ∼6 Å. Addition of the A106V mutation could produce stabilized channel openings in the membrane patch, consistent with the ability of MscS A106V to attain a long lived stable open state (14.Edwards M.D. Li Y. Kim S. Miller S. Bartlett W. Black S. Dennison S. Iscla I. Blount P. Bowie J.U. Booth I.R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar).A significant difference between the two mutants L105W/Ala106 and L105W/Val106 was detectable by fluorescence spectroscopy. Introduction of the A106V mutation causes the reporting Trp residue to reside in a more polar environment, to be more accessible from the bulk water phase, and less restricted in its side chain motions. These data are consistent with solubilization, allowing some relaxation of the subunit packing, causing the pore in the A106V mutant to be open more frequently than in the wild type. A fully and stable open state might be expected to cause more drastic effects on the fluorescence properties of the protein. However, only a small portion of the L105W/Val106 channels might be in the open state in solution. Our approach looking at averaged properties cannot resolve populations.In contrast to the finding that the MscS A106V mutation is found in an open conformation in crystals and when solubilized in solution, electrophysiological experiments indicate that it is more difficult to open when embedded in the membrane than wild type MscS. However, for two reasons, the conformer distribution in solution and the required membrane tension in electrophysiological experiments cannot be directly compared. The tension in the membrane in comparison to the micelle and direct interaction with detergent or lipid molecules is different, which, in turn, will change the energetically favorable conformations. Furthermore, the population of the open state depends on the required tension but also on the open dwell time of the channel. The observed growth inhibition suggests that occasional spontaneous gating leads to the formation of stable open channels. The most surprising observation was that lipids and LPC modified the behavior of the Trp residues in both L105W/Ala106 and L105W/Val106. The greatest change was observed for the former, and the observed properties of the Trp fluorescence in L105W/Ala106 were close to those observed for the effect of introducing the A106V mutation. The simplest interpretation of these data is that lipids and LPC cause structural modifications in both proteins, but that their effects on the Ala106 protein are to generate a more open state. Two immediate mechanisms may account for these changes. First, lipids and LPC could bind directly to MscS channels and thereby cause the structural change. The binding could influence the position of the sensor paddle and thereby cause an opening. Second, the detergent may exert some tension on the protein, which would account for the observation that the first crystallized forms of MscS and MscL are in closed states (10.Bass R.B. Strop P. Barclay M. Rees D.C. Science. 2002; 298: 1582-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 36.Chang G. Spencer R.H. Lee A.T. Barclay M.T. Rees D.C. Science. 1998; 282: 2220-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). Lipids or LPC may then modify the tension resulting in a transition to a more open state. This interpretation would be consistent with the observation that when A106V was crystallized, it was found to be in an open state (12.Wang W. Black S.S. Edwards M.D. Miller S. Morrison E.L. Bartlett W. Dong C. Naismith J.H. Booth I.R. Science. 2008; 321: 1179-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). A titration of LPC to L105W/Ala106 (supplemental Fig. S2) exhibited a half-saturation at ∼0.25 mm, which indicates that rather high amounts are required to observe the effect. The required concentration is also dependent on the detergent concentration. Both observations would support the second explanation that the effect is through the bulk phase rather than specific lipid-binding sites (37.Wilson M.L. Dahlquist F.W. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1920-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the purified MscS still has about three phospholipid molecules associated with each subunit, which corresponds to 30–40% of the boundary layer of lipid (supplemental Fig. S3) (38.Deitrich C.L. Raab A. Pioselli B. Thomas-Oates J.E. Feldmann J. Anal. Chem. 2007; 79: 8381-8390Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 39.Marsh D. Horváth L.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 267-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), consistent with phospholipids bound to MscS that are not removed under our purification regime.The Trp fluorescence data are all consistent with detergent solubilization, allowing the L105W/Val106 protein to move into a conformation closer to the open state. Given that this channel is predominantly in the closed state in cells and in membrane patches, the data are consistent with the channel in detergent experiencing a modified tension that is insufficient to generate the completely open state unless augmented by mutations that stabilize it. Thus, it is possible that the properties of the MscS channel proteins in detergent reflect an intermediate state, close to the closed state, that can be relaxed by lipids or LPC. This observation opens a novel pathway to analysis of MscS channels outside of membrane patches. It has to be stressed, to avoid confusion, that the observed effect of LPC is not related to experiments described earlier where LPC was introduced asymmetrically to one side of the lipid bilayer in liposomes to change the bilayer tension and cause an opening of the reconstituted MscS channel (8.Vásquez V. Sotomayor M. Cordero-Morales J. Schulten K. Perozo E. Science. 2008; 321: 1210-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 40.Vásquez V. Sotomayor M. Cortes D.M. Roux B. Schulten K. Perozo E. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 378: 55-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This is particularly clear as “normal” lipids in our experiments have the same effect as LPC.Finally, we have demonstrated that Trp, one of the smallest spectroscopic probes, is extremely useful as a conformational probe within the pore of a channel. It will allow researchers to detect channel gating independent from the patch clamp technique, for example, in reconstituted systems under changing conditions or in the living cell. These spectroscopic approaches will help to elucidate structural properties of unstable yet mechanistically important states of channels that are generally too unstable to crystallize. IntroductionGating is a fundamental property of all ion and solute channels, and of some transporters, and involves structural transitions that convert the protein from a nonconducting to a conducting state.

J. 2004; 86: 2883-2895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). We have proposed that the structural transition from closed to open involves the rotation and radial movement of the TM3a helices, and Ala106 is a critical residue due to its location at the interhelix interface, where, in the closed state, it interacts with Gly108 on the adjacent pore helix (14.Edwards M.D. Li Y. Kim S. Miller S. Bartlett W. Black S. Dennison S. Iscla I. Blount P. Bowie J.U. Booth I.R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Ala106 was mutated to valine, and this protein variant was found to crystallize in an open state of MscS (12.Wang W. Black S.S. Edwards M.D. Miller S. Morrison E.L. Bartlett W. Dong C. Naismith J.H. Booth I.R. Science. 2008; 321: 1179-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In this structure, Val106 is positioned in an open pocket created by rotation of the TM helices and their radial movement. The mutated residue is not conformationally constrained in the crystal structure. The A106V mutant channel retains function but requires greater pressure to open, and at least two open states are detected by application of increased pressure in patch clamp analysis (14.Edwards M.D. Li Y. Kim S. Miller S. Bartlett W. Black S. Dennison S. Iscla I. Blount P. Bowie J.U. Booth I.R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The current study was undertaken to determine whether Trp substitutions in the pore region could be used to monitor structural transitions associated with either mutation (A106V) or perturbation of the MscS-containing detergent micelles by lipids or LPC. Gating is a fundamental property of all ion and solute channels, and of some transporters, and involves structural transitions that convert the protein from a nonconducting to a conducting state. Channel gating is controlled by specific stimuli, such as transmembrane voltage, a chemical ligand, or a mechanical signal (1.Kung C. Nature. 2005; 436: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), and the coupling between the signal recognition and gating is a major focus of current channel research. Channel activation is frequently rapid, often complex, and may involve multiple states either as unstable intermediates or as well defined stable conformations (2.Shapovalov G. Lester H.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 124: 151-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Channels may be required to respond to more than one signal and/or participate in adaptation processes, where they cease to conduct despite the continued exposure to the gating stimulus (3.Akitake B. Anishkin A. Sukharev S. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 125: 143-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 4.Martinac B. Buechner M. Delcour A.H. Adler J. Kung C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1987; 84: 2297-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). It is, therefore, necessary to detect gating under multiple conditions to understand channel mechanism and function. Patch clamp techniques, which measure the core properties of the channel signal sensitivity, conductance, open dwell time, selectivity, and adaptation, have become a major means to study channels in the membrane. However, this technology requires the channel to be ion-conducting and thus, cannot inform on structural conformations of the nonconducting states. Our understanding of protein conformational changes has been greatly facilitated by biophysical measurements of both native and mutant proteins. In particular, fluorescent probes have proved invaluable complements to spin probes in EPR and related techniques. Tryptophan exhibits natural fluorescence that is very sensitive to environmental changes (5.Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 3rd Ed. Springer, New York2006: 530-577Google Scholar). The peak position in the emission spectrum reflects the polarity of the immediate environment of the Trp residue, quenching by small water-soluble agents is a measure of the accessibility of the residue to the bulk water phase and anisotropy indicates the mobility of the Trp residue. Trp is a rare amino acid in proteins, and its role is often structural. Introduction of Trp is potentially disruptive to the structure of the protein because of its bulky side chain, but although it is the largest natural amino acid, it is small for a fluorophore, particularly when compared with spin labels usually used for EPR spectroscopy. Importantly, the Trp aromatic group is more closely attached to the backbone than is either a spin probe or other fluorophores, which are connected through an engineered Cys residue (see Fig. 1a). The danger for modified residues to “snorkel” into environments moderately remote from their backbone attachment site is significant. Consequently, because Trp fluorescence reports local changes in conformation of the protein, an understanding of the potential of this reporter is important, which we have investigated here in the small mechanosensitive channel, MscS. MscS responds to increases in tension in the membrane bilayer arising from sudden osmotic transitions (hypoosmotic shock). It can also be triggered to open by the insertion of amphipaths or lysophospholipids (e.g. lysophosphatidyl choline, LPC) 2The abbreviations used are: LPClysophosphatidylcholineDOPC1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholineDOPE1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamineDDMn-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranosideFRETFörster resonance energy transferPOPG1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1′-sn-glycerol)QYquantum yieldTMtransmembrane helix. into the membrane bilayer (6.Martinac B.

Science. 2008; 321: 1210-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Gating is extremely rapid (2.Shapovalov G. Lester H.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 124: 151-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and results in the closed channel transitioning to an open state that conducts the passage of small solutes, which releases the tension in the membrane by lowering the osmotic gradient that drives water entry (9.Berrier C. Coulombe A. Szabo I. Zoratti M. Ghazi A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 559-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The structural organization of MscS is known through two complementary crystal structures: the wild type in a nonconducting state and a mutant, A106V, in an open state (10.Bass R.B. Strop P. Barclay M. Rees D.C. Science. 2002; 298: 1582-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 11.Steinbacher S. Bass R. Strop P. Rees D.C. Curr. Top.

Science. 2008; 321: 1179-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). MscS is a homoheptamer of 31-kDa subunits twisted around the central axis of the pore (Fig. 1b). Each subunit contributes three transmembrane helices (TM1–3). TM1 and TM2 form a paddle that is believed to sense the membrane tension; the TM3a helix lines the pore and TM3b, which lies along the membrane surface tangential to the axis of the pore, forms a resistor (12.Wang W.

The overall character of the pore is hydrophobic and residues Leu105 and Leu109 at the lower (cytoplasmic) end of the pore create a hydrophobic seal (10.Bass R.B. Strop P. Barclay M. Rees D.C.

DISCUSSIONCrystal structures of membrane proteins are often difficult to obtain and are almost exclusively not embedded into the natural lipid bilayer. This leads to unanswered mechanistic questions, even when multiple structures are available, as is the case for MscS. Ultimately, dynamic information is required that provides insights not only into the relevance of the crystal states but also into the potential conformational pathways undertaken during channel gating. Clues emerge from electrophysiology, but these are restricted to open and subconducting states. We show here that a Trp probe introduced within the pore of a channel can be used as a gating probe applying fluorescence spectroscopy.Replacing Leu105, which is one of the key seal residues in the pore of MscS, with Trp resulted in a functional and stable MscS complex. In the nonconducting (Ala106) crystal structure, the Leu residues are tightly packed, and it was a surprise that the protein tolerated the Trp substitution at this position, as introduction of Trp increases the volume by 72 Å3 per subunit (35.Richards F.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1977; 6: 151-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2323) Google Scholar). The L105W protein was clearly able to pack the Trp residues and attain a stable conformation as it could be solubilized by detergent and retained its heptameric structure. This is in contrast to L109W, which was expressed, integrated into the membrane and was functional but was unstable after detergent solubilization. The L105W substitution causes disruption of the open state, because stable openings were not observed in patch-clamp analysis. Steric hindrance caused by the Trp side chains may explain this observation, as in the Val106 (i.e. more open) structure the Leu105 side chains are separated by only ∼6 Å. Addition of the A106V mutation could produce stabilized channel openings in the membrane patch, consistent with the ability of MscS A106V to attain a long lived stable open state (14.Edwards M.D. Li Y. Kim S. Miller S. Bartlett W. Black S. Dennison S. Iscla I. Blount P. Bowie J.U. Booth I.R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar).A significant difference between the two mutants L105W/Ala106 and L105W/Val106 was detectable by fluorescence spectroscopy. Introduction of the A106V mutation causes the reporting Trp residue to reside in a more polar environment, to be more accessible from the bulk water phase, and less restricted in its side chain motions. These data are consistent with solubilization, allowing some relaxation of the subunit packing, causing the pore in the A106V mutant to be open more frequently than in the wild type. A fully and stable open state might be expected to cause more drastic effects on the fluorescence properties of the protein. However, only a small portion of the L105W/Val106 channels might be in the open state in solution. Our approach looking at averaged properties cannot resolve populations.In contrast to the finding that the MscS A106V mutation is found in an open conformation in crystals and when solubilized in solution, electrophysiological experiments indicate that it is more difficult to open when embedded in the membrane than wild type MscS. However, for two reasons, the conformer distribution in solution and the required membrane tension in electrophysiological experiments cannot be directly compared. The tension in the membrane in comparison to the micelle and direct interaction with detergent or lipid molecules is different, which, in turn, will change the energetically favorable conformations. Furthermore, the population of the open state depends on the required tension but also on the open dwell time of the channel. The observed growth inhibition suggests that occasional spontaneous gating leads to the formation of stable open channels. The most surprising observation was that lipids and LPC modified the behavior of the Trp residues in both L105W/Ala106 and L105W/Val106. The greatest change was observed for the former, and the observed properties of the Trp fluorescence in L105W/Ala106 were close to those observed for the effect of introducing the A106V mutation. The simplest interpretation of these data is that lipids and LPC cause structural modifications in both proteins, but that their effects on the Ala106 protein are to generate a more open state. Two immediate mechanisms may account for these changes. First, lipids and LPC could bind directly to MscS channels and thereby cause the structural change. The binding could influence the position of the sensor paddle and thereby cause an opening. Second, the detergent may exert some tension on the protein, which would account for the observation that the first crystallized forms of MscS and MscL are in closed states (10.Bass R.B. Strop P. Barclay M. Rees D.C. Science. 2002; 298: 1582-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 36.Chang G. Spencer R.H. Lee A.T. Barclay M.T. Rees D.C. Science. 1998; 282: 2220-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). Lipids or LPC may then modify the tension resulting in a transition to a more open state. This interpretation would be consistent with the observation that when A106V was crystallized, it was found to be in an open state (12.Wang W. Black S.S. Edwards M.D. Miller S. Morrison E.L. Bartlett W. Dong C. Naismith J.H. Booth I.R. Science. 2008; 321: 1179-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). A titration of LPC to L105W/Ala106 (supplemental Fig. S2) exhibited a half-saturation at ∼0.25 mm, which indicates that rather high amounts are required to observe the effect. The required concentration is also dependent on the detergent concentration. Both observations would support the second explanation that the effect is through the bulk phase rather than specific lipid-binding sites (37.Wilson M.L. Dahlquist F.W. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1920-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the purified MscS still has about three phospholipid molecules associated with each subunit, which corresponds to 30–40% of the boundary layer of lipid (supplemental Fig. S3) (38.Deitrich C.L. Raab A. Pioselli B. Thomas-Oates J.E. Feldmann J. Anal. Chem. 2007; 79: 8381-8390Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 39.Marsh D. Horváth L.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 267-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), consistent with phospholipids bound to MscS that are not removed under our purification regime.The Trp fluorescence data are all consistent with detergent solubilization, allowing the L105W/Val106 protein to move into a conformation closer to the open state. Given that this channel is predominantly in the closed state in cells and in membrane patches, the data are consistent with the channel in detergent experiencing a modified tension that is insufficient to generate the completely open state unless augmented by mutations that stabilize it. Thus, it is possible that the properties of the MscS channel proteins in detergent reflect an intermediate state, close to the closed state, that can be relaxed by lipids or LPC. This observation opens a novel pathway to analysis of MscS channels outside of membrane patches. It has to be stressed, to avoid confusion, that the observed effect of LPC is not related to experiments described earlier where LPC was introduced asymmetrically to one side of the lipid bilayer in liposomes to change the bilayer tension and cause an opening of the reconstituted MscS channel (8.Vásquez V. Sotomayor M. Cordero-Morales J. Schulten K. Perozo E. Science. 2008; 321: 1210-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 40.Vásquez V. Sotomayor M. Cortes D.M. Roux B. Schulten K. Perozo E. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 378: 55-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This is particularly clear as “normal” lipids in our experiments have the same effect as LPC.Finally, we have demonstrated that Trp, one of the smallest spectroscopic probes, is extremely useful as a conformational probe within the pore of a channel. It will allow researchers to detect channel gating independent from the patch clamp technique, for example, in reconstituted systems under changing conditions or in the living cell. These spectroscopic approaches will help to elucidate structural properties of unstable yet mechanistically important states of channels that are generally too unstable to crystallize.

In the present study, the molecular mechanism and the metabolic pathway of their production were determined.

Activation of PPARα resulted in the induction of Aldh3a2 and Akr1c18, both of which were confirmed as target genes through introduction of promoter luciferase reporter constructs into mouse livers in vivo.

Hepatic cytochromes P450, aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH3A2), and 21-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (AKR1C18) were found to be involved in this pathway. Activation of PPARα resulted in the induction of Aldh3a2 and Akr1c18, both of which were confirmed as target genes through introduction of promoter luciferase reporter constructs into mouse livers in vivo. This study underscores the power of mass spectrometry-based metabolomics combined with genomic and physiologic analyses in identifying downstream metabolic biomarkers and the corresponding upstream molecular mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2120679218,"The role played by long chain fatty acids (LCFA) in promoting energy expenditure is confounded by their dual function as substrates for oxidation and as putative classic uncouplers of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. LCFA analogs of the MEDICA (MEthyl-substituted DICarboxylic Acids) series are neither esterified into lipids nor beta-oxidized and may thus simulate the uncoupling activity of natural LCFA in vivo, independently of their substrate role. Treatment of rats or cell lines with MEDICA analogs results in low conductance gating of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP), with 10-40% decrease in the inner mitochondrial membrane potential. PTP gating by MEDICA analogs is accounted for by inhibition of Raf1 expression and kinase activity, resulting in suppression of the MAPK/RSK1 and the adenylate cyclase/PKA transduction pathways. Suppression of RSK1 and PKA results in a decrease in phosphorylation of their respective downstream targets, Bad(Ser-112) and Bad(Ser-155). Decrease in Bad(Ser-112, Ser-155) phosphorylation results in increased binding of Bad to mitochondrial Bcl2 with concomitant displacement of Bax, followed by PTP gating induced by free mitochondrial Bax. Low conductance PTP gating by LCFA/MEDICA may account for their thyromimetic calorigenic activity in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2062260658,"The sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor type 1 (S1P(1)) is important for the maintenance of lymphocyte circulation. S1P(1) receptor surface expression on lymphocytes is critical for their egress from thymus and lymph nodes. Premature activation-induced internalization of the S1P(1) receptor in lymphoid organs, mediated either by pharmacological agonists or by inhibition of the S1P degrading enzyme S1P-lyase, blocks lymphocyte egress and induces lymphopenia in blood and lymph. Regulation of S1P(1) receptor surface expression is therefore a promising way to control adaptive immunity. Hence, we analyzed potential cellular targets for their ability to alter S1P(1) receptor surface expression without stimulation. The initial observation that preincubation of mouse splenocytes with its natural analog sphingosine was sufficient to block Transwell chemotaxis to S1P directed subsequent investigations to the underlying mechanism. Sphingosine is known to inhibit protein kinase C (PKC), and PKC inhibition with nanomolar concentrations of staurosporine, calphostin C, and GF109203X down-regulated surface expression of S1P(1) but not S1P(4) in transfected rat hepatoma HTC(4) cells. The PKC activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate partially rescued FTY720-induced down-regulation of the S1P(1) receptor, linking PKC activation with S1P(1) receptor surface expression. FTY720, but not FTY720 phosphate, efficiently inhibited PKC. Cell-based efficacy was obvious with 10 nm FTY720, and in vivo treatment of mice with 0.3-3 mg/kg/day FTY720 showed increasing concentration-dependent effectiveness. PKC inhibition therefore may contribute to lymphopenia by down-regulating S1P(1) receptor cell surface expression independently from its activation."
https://openalex.org/W1978685179,"The inwardly rectifying potassium channel Kir6.2 assembles with sulfonylurea receptor 1 to form the ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channels that regulate insulin secretion in pancreatic beta-cells. Mutations in K(ATP) channels underlie insulin secretion disease. Here, we report the characterization of a heterozygous missense Kir6.2 mutation, G156R, identified in congenital hyperinsulinism. Homomeric mutant channels reconstituted in COS cells show similar surface expression as wild-type channels but fail to conduct potassium currents. The mutated glycine is in the pore-lining transmembrane helix of Kir6.2; an equivalent glycine in other potassium channels has been proposed to serve as a hinge to allow helix bending during gating. We found that mutation of an adjacent asparagine, Asn-160, to aspartate, which converts the channel from a weak to a strong inward rectifier, on the G156R background restored ion conduction in the mutant channel. Unlike N160D channels, however, G156R/N160D channels are not blocked by intracellular polyamines at positive membrane potential and exhibit wild-type-like nucleotide sensitivities, suggesting the aspartate introduced at position 160 interacts with arginine at 156 to restore ion conduction and gating. Using tandem Kir6.2 tetramers containing G156R and/or N160D in designated positions, we show that one mutant subunit in the tetramer is insufficient to abolish conductance and that G156R and N160D can interact in the same or adjacent subunits to restore conduction. We conclude that the glycine at 156 is not essential for K(ATP) channel gating and that the Kir6.2 gating defect caused by the G156R mutation could be rescued by manipulating chemical interactions between pore residues."
https://openalex.org/W1999774048,"Cytochrome c oxidase is a member of the heme-copper family of oxygen reductases in which electron transfer is linked to the pumping of protons across the membrane. Neither the redox center(s) associated with proton pumping nor the pumping mechanism presumably common to all heme-copper oxidases has been established. A possible conformational coupling between the catalytic center (Fe(a3)(3+)-Cu(B)(2+)) and a protein site has been identified earlier from ligand binding studies, whereas a structural change initiated by azide binding to the protein has been proposed to facilitate the access of cyanide to the catalytic center of the oxidized bovine enzyme. Here we show that cytochrome oxidase pretreated with a low concentration of azide exhibits a significant increase in the apparent rate of cyanide binding relative to that of free enzyme. However, this increase in rate does not reflect a conformational change enhancing the rapid formation of a Fe(a3)(3+)-CN-Cu(B)(2+) complex. Instead the cyanide-induced transition of a preformed Fe(a3)(3+)-N(3)-Cu(B)(2+) to the ternary complex of Fe(a3)(3+)-N(3) Cu(B)(2+)-CN is the most likely reason for the observed acceleration. Significantly, the slow rate of azide release from the ternary complex indicates that cyanide ligated to Cu(B) blocks a channel between the catalytic site and the solvent. The results suggest that there is a pathway that originates at Cu(B) and that, during catalysis, ligands present at this copper center control access to the iron of heme a(3) from the bulk medium."
https://openalex.org/W1988703123,"Equilibrative nucleoside transporters play essential roles in nutrient uptake, cardiovascular and renal function, and purine analog drug chemotherapies. Limited structural information is available for this family of transporters; however, residues in transmembrane domains 1, 2, 4, and 5 appear to be important for ligand and inhibitor binding. In order to identify regions of the transporter that are important for ligand specificity, a genetic selection for mutants of the inosine-guanosine-specific Crithidia fasciculata nucleoside transporter 2 (CfNT2) that had gained the ability to transport adenosine was carried out in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Nearly all positive clones from the genetic selection carried mutations at lysine 155 in transmembrane domain 4, highlighting lysine 155 as a pivotal residue governing the ligand specificity of CfNT2. Mutation of lysine 155 to asparagine conferred affinity for adenosine on the mutant transporter at the expense of inosine and guanosine affinity due to weakened contacts to the purine ring of the ligand. Following systematic cysteine-scanning mutagenesis, thiol-specific modification of several positions within transmembrane domain 4 was found to interfere with inosine transport capability, indicating that this helix lines the water-filled ligand translocation channel. Additionally, the pattern of modification of transmembrane domain 4 suggested that it may deviate from helicity in the vicinity of residue 155. Position 155 was also protected from modification in the presence of ligand, suggesting that lysine 155 is in or near the ligand binding site. Transmembrane domain 4 and particularly lysine 155 appear to play key roles in ligand discrimination and translocation by CfNT2.

One family of such proteins, the equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENTs 2The abbreviations used are: ENTequilibrative nucleoside transporterTMtransmembrane domainSCAMsubstituted cysteine accessibility methodSDsynthetic defined mediumMTSEA2-aminoethyl methanethiosulfonateMTSESsodium (2-sulfonatoethyl)methanethiosulfonateORFopen reading frameMITmyo-inositol transporterEC50effective concentration of drug inhibiting growth by 50%PBSphosphate-buffered salineHAhemagglutinin. ; SLC29), transports purine and pyrimidine nucleobases and nucleosides into eukaryotic cells (1.Hyde R.J.

In parasitic protozoa, such as Leishmania, Plasmodium, and trypanosomes, ENTs serve an essential function, because purines cannot be synthesized de novo by these organisms and must be obtained from the environment (2.Downie M.J. Kirk K. Mamoun C.B. Eukaryot. Cell. 2008; 7: 1231-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Mammalian ENTs are of particular interest in renal and cardiovascular function (adenosine transport (3.Elwi A.N. Damaraju V.L. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. Sawyer M.B. Cass C.E. Biochem.

All ENTs studied to date are predicted to be composed of 11 transmembrane-spanning segments (TMs), with a large loop between TM6 and -7 that, like the N terminus, is intracellular, whereas the C terminus projects extracellularly (Fig. 1) (9.Arastu-Kapur S.

All extracellular loops except the first are believed to be quite short, suggesting that ligand discrimination and binding probably depend on amino acid residues within the TMs that project into a water-filled channel. An ab initio structural model of LdNT1.1 predicts that all TMs except TM3, TM6, and TM9 are arranged about this central ligand translocation channel (8.Valdés R. Arastu-Kapur S. Landfear S.M. Shinde U. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 19067-19076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Additionally, mutational analysis by many groups indicates that TMs in the N-terminal half of ENTs (TM1, -2, -4, and -5) (Fig. 1) contribute to ligand affinity and specificity because mutations have been identified in these TMs that confer gain-of-function (increased affinity for particular ligands or inhibitors) or selective loss of affinity for a subset of ligands (Fig. 1). Many other point mutations have been described that lead to partial or complete loss of ENT function (8.Valdés R. Arastu-Kapur S. Landfear S.M. Shinde U. J. Biol.

However, the mutated residues have not been shown to specifically affect ligand binding rather than transporter structure or conformational changes required for ligand translocation. The most intriguing candidate for a ligand binding residue to date is Lys153 in TM4 of LdNT1.1, which when mutated to arginine confers a novel inosine affinity on this adenosine transporter (15.Valdés R. Liu W. Ullman B. Landfear S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22647-22655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This residue was not shown to be located in the ligand binding site, however. Here we show that transmembrane domain 4 lines the ligand translocation channel and helps to define the ligand binding site of an equilibrative nucleoside transporter, valuable information in the structural characterization of this ubiquitous and pharmacologically important protein family. We have identified Lys155 in TM4 (see Fig. 1, black circle) of the Crithidia fasciculata inosine-guanosine transporter CfNT2 (17.Liu W. Arendt C.S. Gessford S.K. Ntaba D. Carter N.S. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2005; 140: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) as a key residue influencing CfNT2 ligand specificity using an unbiased genetic selection for change-of-specificity mutations. Substitutions of asparagine and alanine at this position conferred adenosine transport capability on this transporter and reduced affinity for inosine and guanosine by weakening contacts between the transporter and the purine ring of the ligand, indicating a relaxing of specificity and a phenotype somewhat distinct from that of the orthologous LdNT1.1-K153R mutant (15.Valdés R. Liu W. Ullman B. Landfear S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22647-22655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Cysteine-scanning mutagenesis and thiol-specific modification (SCAM) of CfNT2 TM4 established that this TM lines the ligand translocation channel, which is consistent with the ab initio ENT model (8.Valdés R. Arastu-Kapur S. Landfear S.M. Shinde U. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 19067-19076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). SCAM also demonstrated that Lys155 is water-exposed, lies near the center of TM4 in CfNT2, and is protected from modification by the presence of substrate, intimating that it is located in or near the ligand binding site. Interestingly, the SCAM pattern of TM4 was not strictly helical between residues 152 and 156, opening up the possibility that TM4 is a “broken” helix that contacts ligand at this flexible linker, similar to some sodium-coupled transporters (SLC6), such as LeuT (18.Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1351) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli DH5α and TOP10 strains were used throughout (Invitrogen), and standard methods for recombinant DNA work were employed (19.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley Interscience, New York2002Google Scholar). The purine auxotrophic Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain YPH499 (MATa ura3-52 lys2-801 ade2-101 trp1-Δ63 leu2Δ1) was constructed by Sikorski and Hieter (20.Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Synthetic defined (SD) media were prepared according to standard methods. Microbiological media and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) tablets were obtained from Fisher and MP Biomedicals (Irvine, CA). Yeast were transformed by either the rapid or the high efficiency lithium acetate method (21.Gietz R.D. Woods R.A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2077) Google Scholar). The Leishmania donovani Δldnt1/Δldnt2 line, which lacks all purine nucleoside uptake capability (22.Liu W. Boitz J.M. Galazka J. Arendt C.S. Carter N.S. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem.

Parasites were transfected with plasmid DNA according to the method of Robinson and Beverley (23.Robinson K.A. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem.

Showalter M. Duncan R. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 130: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 50 μg/ml hygromycin (Roche Applied Science), 50 μg/ml phleomycin (RPI Research, Mt. Prospect, IL), and 25 μg/ml G418 (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) at 26 °C using adenine as a purine source. Hygromycin and phleomycin were the drugs employed in the selection of L. donovani Δldnt1/Δldnt2 (22.Liu W. Boitz J.M. Galazka J. Arendt C.S. Carter N.S. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2006; 150: 300-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were obtained from Invitrogen. 2-Aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSEA), sodium (2-sulfonatoethyl)methanethiosulfonate (MTSES), and isoguanosine were purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals, Inc. (North York, Ontario, Canada), 7-deazaguanosine was from ChemGenes (Wilmington, MA), and 2′,3′-dideoxyinosine was from ICN. [3H]Adenosine (30 Ci/mmol) and [3H]inosine (15 Ci/mmol) were obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. (St. Louis, MO). Virtually all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma and were of the highest grade available. All expression of CfNT2 derivatives and CfNT1 in yeast was driven from the high copy pRS426-Cu yeast-E. coli shuttle vector (25.Labbé S. Thiele D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 306: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), which allows copper-inducible expression of the inserted gene and contains a URA3-selectable marker. The construction of the pRS426-Cu-CfNT2 and pRS426-Cu-CfNT1 expression vectors is described by Liu et al. (17.Liu W. Arendt C.S. Gessford S.K. Ntaba D. Carter N.S. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2005; 140: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Leishmanial expression of CfNT2 and its cfnt2 mutant variants was from the pALTneo vector (26.Laban A. Tobin J.F. Curotto de Lafaille M.A. Wirth D.F. Nature. 1990; 343: 572-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) with an N-terminal HA tag, pALTneo-HA, as described (27.Arendt C.S. Ri K. Yates P.A. Ullman B. Anal. Biochem. 2007; 365: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The construction of the cysteineless cfnt2 gene (cfnt2ΔCys) is described by Arendt et al. (27.Arendt C.S. Ri K. Yates P.A. Ullman B. Anal. Biochem. 2007; 365: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). All point mutants were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis of pALTneo-HA-CfNT2 or pALTneo-HA-cfnt2ΔCys performed according to the QuikChange mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with primer design based on the method of Zheng et al. (28.Zheng L. Baumann U. Reymond J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: e115Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). Libraries of mutant cfnt2 molecules carried in the pRS426-Cu vector were constructed by mutagenic PCR followed by in vivo recombination and reconstitution of the expression vector within the yeast strain YPH499. The open reading frames of CfNT2 and cfnt2-G86V were subcloned into the E. coli vector pBluescript II KS(+) to provide PCR templates devoid of yeast sequences. Mutagenic PCR was conducted using the Diversify PCR random mutagenesis kit (Clontech) under conditions that were expected to produce 2.0 base changes per open reading frame (ORF), using pBluescript-CfNT2 (first and second rounds) or pBluescript-cfnt2-G86V (second round) as template. Two independent reaction mixtures were pooled, precipitated with ethanol in the presence of Pellet Paint (Invitrogen), and resuspended in a small volume of TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8) buffer to a concentration of ∼0.25 mg/ml. Within the pRS426-Cu-CfNT2 yeast expression vector, BglII and SphI restriction sites were engineered into the CfNT2 ORF ∼30 bp from the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. Digestion with BglII and SphI followed by gel purification yielded linear vector DNA containing 30 bp of 5′ and 3′ CfNT2 sequence, enough to allow homologous recombination with mutagenized PCR products and formation of a circular expression vector following co-transformation into yeast. YPH499 cells were transformed by the high efficiency lithium acetate method (21.Gietz R.D. Woods R.A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2077) Google Scholar) using 0.25–1.0 μg of PCR-derived mutagenesis library material to 1 μg of linear vector fragment. Cells were immediately plated on SD ura− ade−, 200 μm adenosine, 100 μm CuSO4 (first round of selection) or SD ura− ade−, 100 μm adenosine, 100 μm guanosine, 100 μm CuSO4 (second round of selection). An aliquot of cells was plated on SD ura− to allow quantitation of transformation yield. Initial positive clones were restreaked on the same medium originally used for the selection to verify colony formation. Testing of some positive clones on SD ade− medium showed that growth on adenosine-containing medium was not due to reversion of the ade2 locus. Additionally, plating on 5-fluoroorotic acid to select against the URA3-containing plasmid, followed by streaking on SD ade−, 200 μm adenosine, 100 μm CuSO4 revealed that growth on adenosine was dependent on the presence of the CfNT2 plasmid. pRS426-Cu-cfnt2 plasmids from promising clones were rescued by the smash and grab method (29.Hoffman C.S. Winston F. Gene. 1987; 57: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (2043) Google Scholar), followed by transformation of electrocompetent E. coli. Clones were sequenced to identify mutations, and plasmids of interest were retransformed into YPH499 for further study. All data presented were obtained with retransformed yeast strains. Log phase parasites (∼1 × 107 cells/ml) were washed twice with ice-cold PBS plus 10 mm glucose, brought to a density of 4 × 108 cells/ml, and incubated on ice with 1 mg/ml EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido)hexanoate; Pierce and Thermo Fisher Scientific) in PBS plus 10 mm glucose for 1 h with occasional mixing. Cells were then washed three times with ice-cold 50 mm glycine in PBS and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors) for 1 h on a rotator at 4 °C. After centrifugation for 10 min at 16,000 × g at 4 °C, the supernatant was collected and incubated with washed streptavidin-agarose beads (Pierce) for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer and resuspended in a small volume of 2× Laemmli loading buffer. After separation of proteins by 10% SDS-PAGE, transfer to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane, and blocking in 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS plus 1% Tween (PBST), the membrane was probed with anti-HA monoclonal antibodies (16B12, Covance (Princeton, NJ)) and by goat anti-mouse IgG1-HRP (Roche Applied Science) in 1% milk, PBST, followed by chemiluminescent detection (Western Lightning-ECL, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For detection of biotin-conjugated myo-inositol transporter (MIT) as a loading control, blots were reprobed in 1% milk, PBST with anti-L. donovani MIT polyclonal antiserum (a gift of Dr. S. Landfear, Oregon Health and Science University) and goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (Pierce). Densitometry was performed on developed films using AlphaEaseFC (version 4.0.0, Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA). Relative intensities of HA-cfnt2 spots compared with the HA-CfNT2 spot on each film were estimated after correcting for differences in intensities of MIT (loading control). Log phase parasites (∼1 × 107 cells/ml) were washed three times in ice-cold PBS plus 10 mm glucose and resuspended in the same buffer at a density of 2–4 × 108/ml. Cells were allowed to warm to room temperature for 15 min, and uptake of [3H]inosine or [3H]adenosine was measured by the oil-stop method (30.Aronow B. Kaur K. McCartan K. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem.

Briefly, 100 μl of the cell suspension were mixed with 100 μl of a 2× solution of ligand above a 200-μl cushion composed of a 33:7 mixture of 550 oil (Dow Corning, Midland, MI) to light paraffin oil (catalog number O-119, Fisher). At the desired intervals, cells were centrifuged through the oil cushion at 16,000 × g for 1 min. Following freezing of the sample on dry ice/ethanol, the bottoms of the tubes were clipped into scintillation tubes, and the cells were solubilized in 3 ml of Cytoscint (MP Biomedicals). Scintillation counting was performed after 24–48 h of solubilization and thorough mixing of the contents. For Km determinations, linear rates of uptake for Δldnt1/Δldnt2 pALTneo and Δldnt1/Δldnt2 pALTneo-HA-cfnt2-K155N cells were determined in parallel at six concentrations of [3H]inosine or [3H]adenosine over 2 min. Rates of uptake by vector-transfected cells were subtracted from cfnt2 rates at each concentration, and the corrected rates were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation and plotted in Prism 4.0 (Graphpad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). For competition assays, duplicate tubes containing 5 μm [3H]inosine plus a 500 μm concentration of a potential inhibitor and buffer-matched duplicate control tubes without inhibitor were assayed in parallel at a single time point within the linear range of uptake by the oil-stop method (10 s for Δldnt1/Δldnt2 pALTneo-HA-CfNT2 and 60 s for Δldnt1/Δldnt2 pALTneo-HA-cfnt2-K155N). Samples containing 5 mm unlabeled inosine were used to determine transporter-independent background uptake. Following scintillation counting, corrected uptake levels of parallel samples with and without inhibitor were compared with determined percentage inhibition as follows, (uptake with inhibitor − transporter-independent uptake)/(uptake without inhibitor − transporter-independent uptake). Relative inosine and adenosine uptake rates by various cfnt2-K155 mutant transporters, as summarized in Table 1, were measured and analyzed as follows. Uptake of 5 μm [3H]inosine into Δldnt1/Δldnt2 pALTneo-HA-cfnt2-K155 cells was determined in duplicate over a 4-min time course for each cell line, and rates were determined (pmol/min/107 cells) by linear regression analysis in Prism 4.0. The rates of 5 μm [3H]inosine uptake in the presence of 1 mm unlabeled inosine by each cell line were measured in parallel and subtracted from the rate of uptake in the absence of cold competitor. This transporter-mediated uptake was compared qualitatively among cell lines. Adenosine uptake by cfnt2-K155 cells was low, and the rate of 5 μm [3H]adenosine uptake was not significantly inhibited by the presence of 1 mm unlabeled adenosine. Therefore, linear rates of 5 μm [3H]adenosine uptake over 5 min were measured in duplicate for each cfnt2-K155 cell line and compared with the rate of uptake by vector-transfected cells (consistently 0.2–0.3 pmol/min/107 cells). Those cell lines that consistently had a linear rate of adenosine uptake more than 2 times higher than that of the vector-transfected cells scored at least one “+” on the qualitative scale. Those with a variable response from experiment to experiment were scored as “+/−”, and those that failed to show significant uptake above the vector background were scored as “−”.TABLE 1Adenosine and inosine uptake and analog toxicity by a panel of cfnt2-K155 mutants in L. donovani Δldnt1/Δldnt2Cell lineAdenosine, uptakeaUptake of 5 μm [3H]adenosine relative to vector cells (set to “−”), n = 2.Inosine uptakebUptake of 5 μm [3H]inosine relative to uptake in the presence of 1 mm unlabeled inosine, n = 2.Tubercidin EC50cEC50 values are expressed in μm (n = 3–5).Formycin B EC50cEC50 values are expressed in μm (n = 3–5).Vector−−89.1 ± 1318.9 ± 4.9CfNT1++++−0.0139 ± 0.00461.18 ± 0.14CfNT2−++++3.23 ± 1.20.0163 ± 0.0064cfnt2-K155N+++0.733 ± 0.230.363 ± 0.11cfnt2-K155A+++0.610 ± 0.200.0485 ± 0.018cfnt2-K155Q+/−+0.773 ± 0.300.0828 ± 0.032cfnt2-K155R++++5.74 ± 1.30.185 ± 0.085cfnt2-K155T−+1.62 ± 0.610.102 ± 0.037cfnt2-K155E−−1.90 ± 0.410.322 ± 0.11cfnt2-K155M−−3.01 ± 1.20.102 ± 0.043cfnt2-K155Y−−6.67 ± 0.912.41 ± 1.0cfnt2-K155L−−110. ± 1633.6 ± 5.4a Uptake of 5 μm [3H]adenosine relative to vector cells (set to “−”), n = 2.b Uptake of 5 μm [3H]inosine relative to uptake in the presence of 1 mm unlabeled inosine, n = 2.c EC50 values are expressed in μm (n = 3–5). Open table in a new tab For SCAM assays, aliquots of cells were treated at room temperature with 2.5 mm MTSEA or 10 mm MTSES in PBS plus 10 mm glucose for 10 min and used immediately for uptake experiments as described above. Triplicate measurements of uptake of 5 μm [3H]inosine were taken at a single time point within the linear range of uptake (1.5–5 min, depending on the particular mutant). Background uptake of 5 μm [3H]inosine by untreated cells in the presence of 5 mm unlabeled inosine was subtracted from all other values. In experiments in which protection by ligand was examined, experimental samples were supplemented with 1 mm inosine (from a 50 mm stock in PBS) 2 min prior to MTSES or MTSEA treatment. After 10 min of incubation, unreacted reagent and unlabeled ligand were removed by three washes with 1.5 ml of ice-cold PBS plus 10 mm glucose. Cell density was adjusted to 3–4 × 108/ml, and uptake of 1 μm [3H]inosine and 1 μm [3H]inosine plus 1 m unlabeled inosine was measured in triplicate at a single time point within the linear range of uptake as described above. In a 96-well plate, cells at 1 × 105 cells/ml were mixed with tubercidin or formycin B that had been diluted 2-fold over 11–15 wells. After ∼6 days of growth at 26 °C, Alamar Blue (Invitrogen) was added, and absorbance at 570 and 600 nm was measured at several time points. The percentage reduction of Alamar Blue was calculated as recommended by the manufacturer, and the time point that gave ∼100% reduction at low concentrations of drug (between 1.5 and 4.5 h) was used for calculations. The effective concentration of drug inhibiting growth by 50% (EC50) was determined by fitting the log-plotted data to a sigmoidal dose-response curve in Prism 4.0.

Mutation of ligand-binding residues can result in loss of ligand affinity and therefore loss of transporter function; however, many other types of mutations can also give a loss-of-function phenotype. Therefore, a selection for rare mutants that led to a gain of function, namely a change in ligand specificity, was used to identify regions of the C. fasciculata inosine/guanosine transporter CfNT2 that were specifically required for ligand discrimination rather than ligand translocation and/or proper protein folding. The genetic selection was performed using the yeast S. cerevisiae, an organism that lacks endogenous purine nucleoside transport activity (6.Arastu-Kapur S. Arendt C.S. Purnat T. Carter N.S.
