https://openalex.org/W2570617923,"The extraction of stereo-disparity information from two images depends upon establishing a correspondence between them. In this article we analyze the nature of the correspondence computation and derive a cooperative algorithm that implements it. We show that this algorithm successfully extracts information from random-dot stereograms, and its implications for the psychophysics and neurophysiology of the visual system are briefly discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2041083594,"In canaries and zebra finches, three vocal control areas in the brain are strikingly larger in males than in females. A fourth, area X of the lobus parolfactorius, is well developed in males of both species, less well developed in femal canaries, and absent or not recognizable in femal zebra finches. These size differences correlate well with differences in singing behavior. Males of both species learn song by reference to auditory information, and females do not normally sing. Exogenous testosterone induces singing in female canaries but not in female zebra finches. This is believed to be the first report of such gross sexual dimorphism in a vertebrate brain."

Since it is not susceptible to degradation by brain enzymes, low doses (5 to 10 micrograms) cause profound, long-lasting, morphine-like analgesia when microinjected into rat brain."
https://openalex.org/W1598110035,"A quantitative method is described for measuring the amount of plasminogen activator produced by rat ovarian granulosa cells following exposure to hormones in vivo or in vitro. The results confirm the previously reported observation (Beers, W. H., Strickland, S., and Reich, E. (1975) Cell 6, (387-394) that granulosa cells in vivo produce increasing amounts of plasminogen activator as the time of ovulation approaches and that the enzyme is produced only be cells obtained from follicles destined to ovulate. Inactive cells can be stimulated in vitro by gonadotropins to produce plasminogen activator. This response is time- and dose-dependent, and results in an increase of intracellular and extracellular enzyme. Studies of the specificity of this response indicate that preparations of follicle-stimulating hormone are much more effective than corresponding preparations of luteinizing hormone. The effect of other pituitary hormones is also presented. Molecules other than gonadotropins are also capable of stimulating the cells to produce the enzyme. Prostaglandins E1 and E2 and analogues of cAMP effectively stimulated the cells to produce plasminogen activator, cGMP and its analogues and prostaglandins F1a and F2a were without effect as were the six steroids studied. The inactive compounds also did not inhibit the response of the cells to gonadotropins. The granulosa cell plasminogen activator has been analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and has an apparent molecular weight of 75,000. By this and other criteria, the granulosa cell enzyme is similar to one of the species of plasminogen activators obtained from cultures of simian virus 40-transformed rat embryo fibroblasts."

The results indicated that the direction of cerebral lateralization could be indexed from a subject's handedness and hand posture during writing. In subjects with a normal writing posture, the linguistically specialized hemisphere was contralateral to the dominant hand, and the visuospatially specialized hemisphere was ipsilateral; the reverse was true in subjects with an ""inverted"" hand position during writing. Females and subjects having an inverted hand posture manifested smaller degrees of lateral differentiation than males and subjects with a typical hand posture."
https://openalex.org/W1603919509,"A first order calcium-dependent transition can be monitored by a decrease in the intrinsic fluorescence of the isolated pro (Fragment1) region of prothrombin. The maximum fluorescence change is -40% for Fragment 1, and only about -6% for whole prothrombin. The most remarkable features of this transition are its rate and activation energy. The half-life for the transition at 0 degrees is about 100 min, and the temperature dependence shows an activation energy of 21 kcal/mol. The rate constant for the forward reaction is zero order in calcium and is not affected by the presence of phospholipid membranes. The equilibrium for the transition, however, is affected by phospholipid. At 30 degrees, [Ca]eq (the calcium concentration where half of the protein has undergone the transition) is 0.4 mM and the Hill coefficient is 2.6. Under the same conditions but in the presence of phospholipid [Ca]eq is 0.24 mM and the Hill coefficient is about 4.5. The transition is triggered by binding 3 or 4 calcium ions. The rate of Fragment 1 binding to phospholipid vesicles was tested using gel filtration techniques at 0 degrees. The rate constants, activation energy, and [Ca]eq values for this process were shown to correspond to the properties of the fluorescence change. The rate constants, activation energy, and Hill coefficients for binding of whole prothrombin to phospholipid correspond to the same parameters for Fragment 1 but the [Ca]eq values are lower. At 0 degrees, the [Ca]eq is 0.19 mM for the prothrombin transition and 0.1 mM for the transition in the presence of phospholipid. These results demonstrate that Fragment 1 and prothrombin undergo a transition when exposed to calcium ions which necessarily precedes protein-phospholipid interactions. In addition to its role in determining the correct protein structure, calcium plays a second role in prothrombin-phos-pholipid interaction which is in the actual formation of the protein-phospholipid bond. The [Ca]eq for binding protein (after its transition) to phospholipid is about 0.06 mM."

https://openalex.org/W1584590512,"We have examined the question, is the carbohydrate moiety of ovalbumin attached to nascent chains or to the completed protein after its release from polyribosomes. Ovalbumin nascent chains have been isolated from hen oviduct by immunoprecipitation of ovalbumin-synthesizing polysomes and subsequent isolation of peptidyl-tRNA by DEAE-cellulose chromatography. Our results indicate that both glucosamine and mannose are incorporated into ovalbumin nascent chains by hen oviduct fragments. Although the asparagine to which the carbohydrates are attached is 10 amino acid residues from the NH2 terminus, the majority of the carbohydrate, if not all, is attached only to those peptide chains that have been essentially completed."
https://openalex.org/W1531987646,"The active protein components of initiation factor M2B (IF-M2B) have been resolved into two homogeneous factors. These proteins, IF-M2Balpha and IF-M2Bbeta, were purified 300- and 500-fold, respectively, with a yield of about 15% of the original starting activity. The low molecular weight (approximately 17,000) of these two proteins is in contrast with the much greater molecular weights that have been found for other initiation factors. IF-M2Balpha is also unique among the initiation factors in that it contains no tryptophan and is capable of self-association. Both proteins are required for model assays which utilize 40 S and 60 S subunits (poly(U)-directed polyphenylalanine synthesis or AUG-directed methionyl-puromycin synthesis). IF-M2Bbeta has been shown to be required for hemoglobin synthesis, however, the presence of high concentrations of IF-M2Balpha in the 100,000 X g lysate supernatant has precluded the demonstration of an IF-M2Balpha requirement in hemoglobin synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2136078990,"Fibroblasts obtained from healthy and diseased human gingiva were labeled with radioactive amino acids and the collagenous proteins synthesized were studied. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of untreated, reduced, and pepsin-treated proteins of the medium and cell extract showed that the collagenous proteins synthesized by these cells exist in the precursor form. Type I collagen was the chief constituent. In addition, cells from normal tissue synthesized type III collagen in amounts varying from 5 to 30%. Type III collagen was not detected in the cultures of fibroblasts from diseased tissue; however, an additional collagen fractionated between 2.5 to 5.0 M NaCl and accounted for 22 to 29% of the total. This collagen had an alpha1/alpha2 ratio of 8.6 and hydroxylysine/lysine ratio and cyanogen bromide peptide pattern were similar to that of alpha1[I]. It is concluded that the fibroblasts derived from disease gingiva synthesize a collagen of composition (alpha1)3, probably of type I."
https://openalex.org/W1527218301,"Transformed mouse fibroblasts, in which [3H]arachidonic acid was incorporated in the cellular lipids, released radioactive materials into the medium when stimulated by bradykinin and thrombin. Most of this released radioactivity was found in the landins; the remainder was present in the arachidonic acid fraction. When the cells stimulated by serum or when they were mechanically manipulated, not only prostaglandins but also high levels of arachidonic acid were released. Anti-inflammatory steroids, which decrease the availability of arachidonic acid, inhibited the stimulated release of prostaglandins caused by the vasoactive agents, suggesting that bradykinin and thrombin stimulated prostaglandin synthesis by increasing deacylation of the phospholipids. The efficiency of the conversion of the released arachidonic acid into prostaglandins appears to reflect the cellular proximity of the phospholipid deacylating activity and prostaglandin synthesizing system."

https://openalex.org/W1553386262,"Venom of the scorpion Leiurus quinquestriatus acts cooperatively with the alkaloids veratridine, aconitine, and batrachotoxin in activating the action potential Na+ ionophore. A small (Mr = 6700), basic (pI approximately 9.8), toxic polypeptide purified approximately 80-fold from this venom by ion exchange chromatography appears homogeneous by gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing and, like whole venom, acts cooperatively with the alkaloids veratridine, aconitine, and batrachotoxin to activate the action potential Na+ ionophore. The action of the scorpion toxin is slowly reversible. Concentration-response curves suggest interaction with a single class of sites with KD - 1.3 to 2.4 nM. The scorpion toxin is a poor activator of the Na+ ionophore when tested alone. However, treatment of cells sequentially with scorpion toxin followed by veratridine activates as well as treatment with both simultaneously suggesting that scorpion toxin binds in the absence of veratridine but does not activate the Na+ ionophore unless veratridine is present. In contrast, scorpion toxin causes 3- to 20-fold decreases in apparent KD for aconitine, veratridine, and batrachotoxin. The effect of the toxin is inhibited competitively by divalent cations and noncompetitively by tetrodotoxin (KI - 4 nM)."
https://openalex.org/W1623126220,"Rat liver microsomes contain a vitamin K-dependent carboxylase activity that converts specific glutamyl residues of microsomal prothrombin precursor to gamma-carboxyglutamic acid residues. This activity has now been solubilized by treatment with Triton X-100. The pentapeptide, Phe-Leu-Glu-Glu-Val, has been synthesized; and it has been demonstrated that, in the presence of this peptide, the solubilized microsomes catalyze a vitamin K-dependent incorporation of added H14CO3- into a low molecular weight trichloroacetic acid-soluble compound. The carboxylated product has been identified as peptide-bound gamma-carboxyglutamic acid by its chemical stability during acidic and alkaline hydrolysis and by co-chromatography of an alkaline hydrolysate of the product with authentic gamma-carboxyglutamic acid. The conditions for peptide carboxylation appear to be identical with those demonstrated for precursor carboxylation."
https://openalex.org/W1605767657,"Uptake of 125I-labeled diphtheria toxin and serologically related proteins by a sensitive human HeLa cell line and by a resistant mouse L929 cell line has been studied. The evidence suggests that there is an initial rapid reaction between a recognition site present on the toxin Fragment B and specific plasma membrane receptors on the sensitive cell (there are approximately 4000/HeLa cell). This initial interaction is followed by a slow irreversible process during which there is a major conformational alteration of the toxin molecule causing the enzymically active 22,000-dalton Fragment A to become exposed to the cytosol. We suggest that it is at this point that cleavage of the NH2-terminal disulfide bond occurs leading to release of Fragment A into the cytoplasm. The toxin Fragment B remains attached to the membrane, probably formed in a complex with receptor, and blocks entry of additional toxin molecules through the same site. Specific membrane receptors are lacking from mouse cells. Both HeLa cells and L929 cells internalize toxin, related nontoxic proteins, and inert molecules such as inulin nonspecifically into endocytotoc vesicles. At 30 degrees the bulk internalization of extracellular fluid is about 1.2% of their cell volume per h for both cell lines. Fragment A does not traverse the plasma membrane by a mechanism that depends on endocytosis. The interaction of diphtheria toxin with the sensitive cell membrane is discussed in relation to other protein toxins and certain glycopeptide tropic hormones in which relatively large, hydrophilic polypeptide fragments or subunits are presumed to traverse the target cell plasma membrane and reach the cytoplasm in biologically active form."
https://openalex.org/W1531774225,"Homogeneous S-adenosylhomocysteinase contains tightly bound NAD+. This NAD+ is not dissociable under nondenaturing conditions but can be removed by heat or acid denaturation. Addition of adenosine to the enzyme causes an increase in the absorption at 327 nm which we attribute to NADH formation. The enzyme also catalyzes the rapid exchange of the adenosine 4'-proton with solvent water. A mechanism is proposed for the reversible hydrolysis of S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine involving oxidation of position 3' of adenosine followed by alpha-beta elimination of L-homocysteine to give 3'-deto-4',5'-dehydro-5'-deoxyadenosine. This compound reacts with water in a Michael-type addition to form 3'-keto adenosine which is then re-reduced to adenosine."
https://openalex.org/W1885625352,"Previous studies have demonstrated that both the 105,000 X g soluble supernatant (S105) and microsomal membranes from rat liver are required for the enzymatic conversion of squalene to cholesterol (Scallen, T.J., Dean, W.J., and Schuster, M.W. (1968) J. Biol. Chem. 243, 5202). It was postulated that S105 contained a noncatalytic carrier protein which was required for this enzymatic process (Scallen, T. J., Schuster, M.W., and Dhar, A.K. (1971) J. Biol. Chem. 246, 224). Later evidence demonstrated that S105 contained at least two proteins which were required for the microsomal conversion of squalene to cholesterol (Scallen, T.J., Srikantaiah, M.V., Seetharam, B., Hansbury, E., and Gavey, K.L. (1974) Fed. Proc. 33, 1733). This article describes the purification and properties of the first of these soluble proteins, sterol carrier protein1 (SCP1), which has been purified 575-fold from rat liver S105. While SCP1 specifically activated the enzymatic conversion of squalene to lanosterol by liver microsomal membranes, SCP1 possessed no capacity to activate the microsomal conversion of [3H-A14,4-dimethyl-delta8-cholestenol to C27 sterols or of [3H]7-dehydrocholesterol to cholesterol. Lanosterol was identified by silicic acid chromatography and mass spectrometry. The formation of lanosterol was a hyperbolic function of the concentration of SCP1 present in the incubation mixture. The Km observed for SCP1 was similar to the Km observed for squalene. The formation of lanosterol from squalene required FAD. The addition of phosphatidylserine increased enzymatic activity; however, phosphatidylserine was not required for this conversion. SCP1 was catalytically inactive when it was incubated with [3H] squalene and cofactors in the absence of microsomes. Substantial evidence supports the hypothesis that SCP1 operates as a noncatalytic carrier protein for the water-insoluble substrate squalene in the enzymatic conversion of squalene to lanosterol by liver microsomal membranes."

https://openalex.org/W1600919994,"A lectin from Wistaria floribunda seeds which specifically binds to N-acetyl-D-galactosamine was purified to homogeneity as judged by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Its molecular weight was estimated to be 68,000 by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. It dissociated into subunits on reduction with 2-mercaptoethanol with concomitant loss of hemagglutinating activity. On oxidation in air, the subunits reassociated into the lectin molecules with hemagglutinating activity. Carboxymethylation of the subunits with iodoacetic acid prevented their reassociation on oxidation in air. The molecular weight of the subunits was 32,000, which is about one-half that of the native lectin, suggesting that the lectin consists of two subunits. The results total, NH2-terminal, and COOH-terminal amino acid analyses, and mapping of the tryptic digest of the lectin indicated that these two subunits were indistinguishable and were probably identical, and that they were linked together covalently through a single disulfide bond. Equilibrium dialysis experiments show that the lectin and its subunit molecules are divalent and monovalent, respectively, with respect to sugar binding. The lectin is a glycoprotein, containing 3.2% carbohydrate. The carbohydrate moiety is composed of mannose, galactose, and glucosamine is a molar ratio of 1:2:1 and these sugars seem to be linked as a single oligosaccharide chain to each subunit of the protein."

https://openalex.org/W1548719481,"Complex U, which contains the last two enzymes (orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.10) and orotidylate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.23)) of the six enzymes for the de novo biosynthesis of UMP, has been purified 200-fold from mouse Ehrlich ascites cells. The specific activity of the orotate phosphoribosyltransferase and the orotidylate decarboxylase activities of the complex were 0.115 and 0.290 mumol of product/mg of protein/min; the recovery of the activities was high being 20 to 30%. The rate of the two activities remained similar to that of the homogenate. At the sixth step of the fractionation, one can obtain a fraction that has lost phosphoribosyltransferase activity but retains decarboxylase activity. The apparent molecular weights, as determined by density gradient centrifugation, of the native complex and the fraction containing only decarboxylase activity are identical, 55,700 +/- 4,000. Both activities of complex U are labile to very mild treatments such as dilution, dialysis, or storage at 3 degrees. Dithiothreitol and 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PP-Rib-P), but not orotic acid or MgCl2, can stabilize either or both of the enzyme activities. The degree of stabilization by three of these chemicals varies with the reagent(s) used, with the nature of the treatment, and with the concentration of Complex U. When PP-Rib-P, Mg2+ and dithiothreitol are present in the diluting buffer the activity losses were slowed and then followed by a partial recovery of the phosphoribosyltransferase activity. Maximum activities of both enzymes are observed by adding undiluted complex to a complete reaction mixture without preincubation. The complex cannot be exposed to pH values of 4 or below, or pH 9 or above. The stability studies have led to the development of conditions that permit one, for the first time, to subject the complex to electrophoresis and to recover a large percentage of both enzyme activities, rather than only decarboxylase activity as has occurred in the past. The electrophoretic studies indicate that PP-Rib-P produces a complex whose conformation and/or net charge differ significantly from that of the complex in the absence of PP-Rib-P. Kinetic characteristics of the transferase are a pH optimum between 6.5 and 7.5, apparent Km values for orotate, PP-Rib-P, and Mg2+ of 1.9 muM, 16 muM, and 2.9 mM, respectively; for the decarboxylase, a sharp pH optimum of 7.0 is observed, and a Km value for orotidine 5'-phosphate of 0.8 muM."
https://openalex.org/W1994442763,"Photographic images obtained by the Kirlian technique are principally a record of corona activity during an exposure interval. Most of the variations in the images of the corona of a living subject who is in contact with the photographic film can be accounted for by the presence of moisture on or within the subject's surface. During exposure, moisture is transferred from the subject to the emulsion surface of the photographic film and causes an alteration of the electric charge pattern on the film, hence the electric field at the surface of the subject. As a result, large variations in the density of corona images, corona streamer trajectories, and image coloration can be brought about. The radial extent of corona images--that is, the range of corona streamers--is an inverse function of the resistance in the circuit formed by the high-voltage supply, the subject, and the film-electrode configuration. This is because the voltage at which corona is initiated is dependent on the rate of rise of the voltage impressed between the subject and the electrode, and the rate of rise is governed by the applied voltage waveform and the voltage drop across the resistance. The range of streamers is proportional to the corona onset voltage. However, we have not seen any influence of large changes in skin resistance on streamer range. Presumably, this is due to the shunting effect of skin capacitance. In general, the photographic response to moisture suggests that corona discharge photography may be useful in the detection and quantification of moisture in animate and inanimate specimens through the orderly modulation of the image due to various levels of moisture."

We have analyzed the translation products synthesized in the presence of different concentrations of m7G5'p and find that translation of all mRNAs is equally inhibited. To demonstrate the specificity of the inhibitor for RNAs with 5'-terminal m7G5' ppp... we show that specific translation products of satellite tobacco necrosis virus RNA, which does not have this 5' terminus, are synthesized in the presence of m7G5' p. Protein synthesis programmed by endogenous mRNA in a HeLa cell-free system is inhibited after a 10-min lag by m7G5' p. Other guanosine nucleotides without the 7-methyl group or with the phosphate in a different position are not inhibitor. We show that translation of all mRNAs is inhibited to a similar extent by m7G5'p in the HeLa cell-free system, by synthesizing 35S-labeled proteins in the presence of different inhibitory concentrations of this nucleotide and analyzing the translation products by electrophoresis and autoradiography. Translation of encephalomyocarditis virus RNA added to the HeLa cell-free system is not inhibited by m7g5p; this viral RNA does not have this nucleotide at the 5' terminus. This indicates that m7G5'p specifically inhibits translation of mRNAs with the 5' terminus m7G5'ppp... and suggests that initiation of translation of picornavirus RNA may proceed via a mechanism different from that of cellular mRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W1497557316,"Two peptide bonds of staphylococcal enterotoxin C, were hydrolyzed concurrently at quite different rates during limited digestion with trypsin. A Lys-Val at about position 92 in the disulfide loop was the first bond cleaved, followed by a Lys-Asx at about position 57 on the NH2-terminal side of the loop. Preparations of singly cleaved material (enterotoxin C1-T1) contained about 93% of the cleaved protein and 7% unreacted enterotoxin. Preparations of the doubly cleaved material (enterotoxin C1-T2) consisted of 98% enterotoxin C1-T2 and 2% enterotoxin C1-T1. In the absence of denaturant, enterotoxin C1-T2 behaved as a single particle. It gave a single peak on Sephadex G-75 with a sedimentation coefficient of 2.85 S and a molecular weight of 29,100 by sedimentation equilibrium. Circular dichroic spectra indicated only minor conformational differences between enterotoxins C1-T2 and C1. However conformational stability was significantly affected with the unfolding of enterotoxin C1-T2 in 4 M guanidine hydrochloride proceeding at about twice the rate of native enterotoxin. Enterotoxin C1-T2 was separated into 6,500 and 22,000 molecular weight polypeptides by gel filtration on Sepharose 6B in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride. Complementation (as measured by CD spectra, serologic activity and mitogenicity) of the two polypeptides was readily achieved from solution in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride by dialysis against phosphate buffer. The 22,000 molecular weight polypeptide was further separated into two peptides (Mr = 4,000 and 19,000 after alkylation of the reduced disulfide bridge. Summation of the amino acid composition of the constituent peptides of enterotoxin C1-T2 agreed well with the composition of enterotoxin C1. A comparison of the 6,500 and 4,000 molecular weight polypeptides from enterotoxin C1-T2 with structurally equivalent segments of enterotoxin B suggested structural homology between the two antigenic variants. Enterotoxins C1, C1-T1, and C1-T2 gave reactions of complete identity in Ouchterlony immunodiffusion and were indistinguishable in the quantitative precipitin reaction. Enterotoxins C1-T1 and C1-T2 were highly mitogenic but were slightly less potent than the native enterotoxin. Enterotoxin C1-T2 had equivalent emetic activity to enterotoxin C1 in rhesus monkeys. It is suggested that the exceptional lability to limited enzymic hydrolysis exemplified by enterotoxin C1 is associated with beta turn structures at protein surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W1503408062,"Abnormal lysyl residues can be detected in aspartate transaminase by following the rate of reaction of amino groups with KN14CO and the rate of enzymatic inactivation. Peptide isolation subsequent to carbamylation of the apoenzyme produces a peptide which is absent in the carbamylated holoenzyme. The composition of the carbamylated peptide matches that of a tryptic peptide containing the active site Lys-258. The holoenzyme retains full catalytic activity after carbamylation of its NH2-terminal alanine and lysyl residues other than Lys-258, which is protected by aldimine formation with pyridoxal phosphate. Apoenzyme prepared from KNCO-treated holoenzyme (apoenzyme') is susceptible to further carbamylation at Lys-258 with irreversible loss of catalytic activity. Carbamylation of the active site lysyl residue is 25 to 50 times more rapid than that of the other 18 lysyl residues of aspartate transaminase. The kinetics of inactivation by KNCO at different pH values served to determine the pH-independent second order rate constant (k) and the pK of the amino group of Lys-258. These values are pK = 7.98 +/- 0.08 and k = 146 +/- 5 M-1S-1, which are similar to the values determined for carbamylation of the NH2- terminal groups of human hemoglobin (Garner, M. H., Bogardt, R. A., and Gurd, E. R. N. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 4398-4404). The pK value for Lys-258 is as low as that for a group in the active site region which can perturb a 19F nuclear magnetic resonance probe inserted into that region (Martinez-Carrion, M., Slebe, J. C., Boettcher, B., and Relimpio, A. M. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 1853-1858). Apoenzyme carbamylated at Lys-258 can accept pyridoxal phosphate at the active site even though no Schiff base in formed. Furthermore, this active site carbamylated holoenzyme will form spectroscopically detectable enzyme-substrate complexes with amino acids. The complexes slowly convert to species with absorbance identical with that of enzyme in the pyridoxamine phosphate form."
https://openalex.org/W2287339747,"This paper presents evidence that earlier kinetic determinations of rat liver beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the reported rate-determining enzyme in cholesterol biogenesis, may have substantially underestimated the affinity of this enzyme for HMG-CoA. Nonlinear conversion of this substrate to mevalonic acid, with time, is shown under the conditions of a previous study, and it was concluded that velocities were limited at the lower substrate levels tested by an insufficient quantity of substrate. For this present study, conditions were established under which linearity of time versus product formation was observed, and the extent of conversion did not exceed 6% of the initial quantity of D isomer. These conditions gave a Michaelis-Menten constant of 1.01 +/- 0.12 muM for the D isomer, which is 3.5 to 40 times lower than those previously reported."

Cells were labeled in media containing [3H] adenosine and transferred to media containing no radioactive precursor and incubated further in the presence or absence of actinomycin D. After various times following the transfer of the cells, globin mRNA was isolated using a combination of oligo(dT)-cellulose affinity chromatography, sucrose density centrifugation, and globin cDNA (the complementary DNA copy of globin mRNA)-cellulose affinity chromatography. The size of the poly(A) region was determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the T1 and pancreatic RNase-resistant fragments. The prelabeled poly(A) region which initially comprises approximately 150 adenylate residues was found to become shorter with time, both in cells incubated in medium containing no radioactive precursor and in the presence of actinomycin D. After 9 h of incubation in the presence of actinomycin D, two major size classes of poly(A) were observed, one containing 35 to 45 adenylic acid residues and the other containing 55 to 65 residues. These two size classes are similar to those found in circulating reticulocytes suggesting that the poly(A) shortening observed in these cell incubation studies is similar to that which occurs in vivo. Two protein synthesis inhibitors, emetine and cycloheximide, were investigated with respect to their effect on poly(A) shortening. Neither drug inhibited the shortening of the poly(A) region of globin mRNA, suggesting that protein synthesis is not required for this process to occur."
https://openalex.org/W1592445058,"Nerve growth factor (NGF) receptors of rabbit superior cervical ganglia can be solubilized by treatment with detergents and readily assayed in the soluble state. Triton X-100 and deoxycholate reduce specific binding of NGF to ganglia membranes. In membranes treated with Triton X-100 (0.5 to 2.0%) the reduction in NGF binding by membranes is accompanied by a corresponding increase in binding in the supernatant fluid. NGF binding in soluble preparations can be rapidly assayed by precipitating NGF bound to receptors with polyethylene glycol under conditions in which unbound NGF is not precipitated. NGF binding to soluble preparations is saturable whether evaluated by the binding of 125I-NGF or by diluting 125I-NGF with native NGF. Using both techniques, the dissociation constant for NGF binding to soluble receptors is about 0.2 nM, the same as its dissociation constant from receptor sites in intact membranes. NGF binding to soluble receptors displays a high degree of peptide specificity, similar to receptor sites in intact membranes of superior cervical ganglia. A method of labeling NGF with 125I-3(4-hydroxyphenyl) propionic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester is described which leads to binding properties that are superior to those obtained with previously described 125I-NGF preparations."

https://openalex.org/W1583758158,"The data from chemical studies and electron microscopy suggest that Semliki Forest virus obtains its envelope by budding into the medium from the plasma membrane of the host cell. Biochemical evidence for this phenomenon, however, has not been published. Therefore, we undertook a series of pulse-chase studies so that we might quantitatively evaluate the importance of the budding mechanism in the morphogenesis of Semliki Forest virus. Baby hamster kidney cells (clone 13) were grown in culture and infected with Semliki Forest virus. The cells were exposed to [4,5-3H] leucine for 20 min and the subsequent incorporation of the label into virus proteins associated with cytoplasmic membranes and extracellular virus was determined. Initial experiments were conducted with microsomes and a precursor-product relationship was demonstrated between viral proteins in the microsomes and in extracellular virus. Further studies were performed with endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane preparations. Maximal incorporation of [3H] leucine was observed in the viral proteins located in the endoplasmic reticulum at the end of a 20-min pulse period; greater than 50% of this activity had disappeared within 2 h. The plasma membrane fraction contained no radioactivity at the end of the pulse period; subsequently, maximal labeling of the viral proteins in the plasma membrane occurred 4 h into the chase period and these labeled proteins had disappeared from this membrane 11 h after the pulse. At this time maximal incorporation of the labeled proteins into extracellular virus was observed. These data are consistent with a precursor-product relationship between the viral proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum which migrate to the plasma membrane and are subsequently incorporated into extracellular virus. All the radioactivity in the extracellular virus appears to have been derived from viral proteins associated with the plasma membrane of the cell. Therefore, mechanisms for the morphogenesis of Semliki Forest virus (in baby hamster kidney cells), other than budding from the plasma membrane, are unlikely to be of quantitative importance."
https://openalex.org/W1636063482,"Soluble and membrane-bound adenylate cyclase from the canine renal medulla are very slowly activated by guanosine 5'-(beta,gamma-imino)triphosphate (Gpp(NH)p) or fluoride. At 25 degrees, 8 to 10 h of incubation of the soluble enzyme, and 6 to 8 h of incubation of the membrane-bound enzyme are required to reach the maximal activity. The dependence of activation on concentration of Gpp(NH)p changes with time. Half-maximal activation of soluble adenylate cyclase occurs at 3 +/- 1 X 10(-6) M Gpp(NH)p if the activity is measured without preincubation with Gpp(NH)pp and at 4 +/- 2 X 10(-8) M if it is measured after 6 to 22 h of incubation with Gpp(NH)p at 25 degrees. The activation occurs over a rather broad range of nucleotide concentration and cannot, therefore, be simply interpreted to reflect a function of nucleotide binding. Two forms of soluble adenylate cyclase are resolved by Sepharose gel filtration. One form, with a Stokes radius of 71 A, is rapidly activated by Gpp(NH)p; the other, with a Stokes radius of 56 A, requires long incubation with Gpp(NH)p to be activated. The sedimentation coefficient of the two forms is 7.3 S. The apparent molecular weight of the rapidly activated form is 200,000 while that of the slowly activated form is 160,000. The interrelationship of these two species of adenylate cyclase is not clear and is under investigation."
https://openalex.org/W1597929613,"Experimental evidence showing specificity of rabbit reticulocyte initiation factor 3 (EIF-3) for selective initiation of mRNA translation is presented. A new cell-free system was developed from Crithidia fasciculata. The crude postmitochondrial supernatant fluid was treated with puromycin and 0.5 M KCl to dissociate mRNA from polysomes and ribosomes into subunits. The drug and salt were removed by gel filtration on Sephadex G-25. Additions of amino acids and energy source initiate protein synthesis. All synthesis starts at the initiation site. This treatment brought about a shift in MgCl2 optimum from 6 to 3 mM. Exogenously supplied rabbit reticulocyte globin mRNA is faithfully translated in this system. However, crithidial EIF-3 has a low affinity for globin mRNA as evidenced by a 6-fold increase in the rate of globin synthesis after the addition of rabbit reticulocyte EIF-3 in the range at which globin synthesis is linear to the amount of globin mRNA added to the system. It is also shown that in a reconstituted system in which ribosomal subunits are depleted from initiation factors, EIF-3 from rabbit reticulocytes has a higher affinity for globin mRNA, as measured by the formation of polysomes during the linear time of amino acid incorporation. These results are taken to indicate that initiation factor EIF-3 action should be considered as an enzyme catalyzed reaction for which various mRNAs serve as different substrate analogs. Therefore, specificity is most likely to be expressed as an affinity of enzyme to substrate and would show as rate difference rather than an all-or-none phenomenon."

Both the ATP- and ADP-dependent decarboxylation of oxalacetate and the carboxylation activity of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase are inhibited by 3-mercaptopicolinic acid while phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase are not inhibited. 3-Mercaptopicolinic acid inhibits the fixation of 14CO2 by illuminated P. maximum bundle sheath strands which is dependent upon oxalacetate and ATP but does not affect C3 photosynthesis in bundle sheath strands nor C4 photosynthesis in mesophyll cells. 3-Mercaptopicolinic acid treatment reduced P. maximum leaf photosynthesis 25% while raising the photosynthetic CO2 compensation point from near zero to 18 to 45 mul of CO2/liter of air."

https://openalex.org/W1499125641,"Human erythrocyte pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40, ATP-pyruvate phosphotransferase) was found to display a time-dependent activation (lag phase) in the reaction progress curves. The extent of this lag phase depended upon the treatment of the enzyme prior to assay. Preincubation of the enzyme with adenine nucleotides amplified the lag, whereas prior treatment with phosphoenolpyruvate diminished it. The activation process was first order in enzyme with the pseudo first order rate constants being a hyperbolic function of phosphoenolpyruvate concentration. The data provide evidence for a phosphoenol-pyruvate-mediated conversion of the enzyme to a more active form. Studies with the irreversible sulfhydryl inhibitor, N-ethylmaleimide (MalNEt), provided additional evidence for different conformational states of the enzyme induced by its substrates and effectors. Adenine nucleotides were found to promote inactivation by MalNEt and phosphoenolpyruvate protected against MalNEt. The possible metabolic significance of this hysteretic pyruvate kinase is discussed in relation to the known role of this enzyme in 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate metabolism (Rose, I.A. (1971) Exp. Eye Res. 11, 264-272)."
https://openalex.org/W1515741887,"Separation of adult rat bone marrow cells by the method of thin layer countercurrent distribution permits the analyses of 59Fe-tagged erythroid cells for the various multiple hemoglobins and the assignment of such hemoglobins to erythroid cells at different stages of their development. Of the six adult red cell hemoglobins, hemoglobin 5 is synthesized most actively in the earliest erythroid cell whereas hemoglobin 4 (the major hemoglobin of the red cell) is synthesized most actively in the latest erythroid cells, e.g. the reticulocyte. Experimental evidence also indicates that maturation of the erythroid cell is accompanied by a decreased rate of synthesis of hemoglobin 5. The earliest erythroid cells of the marrow contain two hemoglobins, 7 and 8, which are absent in the adult red cell. Similar studies with the guinea pig confirm the nonuniform biosynthesis of its two hemoglobins and suggest that the phenomenon may be a general one among mammalian multiple hemoglobins."
