https://openalex.org/W2612812586,"The sequence of the human genome encodes the genetic instructions for human physiology, as well as rich information about human evolution. In 2001, the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium reported a draft sequence of the euchromatic portion of the human genome. Since then, the international collaboration has worked to convert this draft into a genome sequence with high accuracy and nearly complete coverage. Here, we report the result of this finishing process. The current genome sequence (Build 35) contains 2.85 billion nucleotides interrupted by only 341 gaps. It covers approximately 99% of the euchromatic genome and is accurate to an error rate of approximately 1 event per 100,000 bases. Many of the remaining euchromatic gaps are associated with segmental duplications and will require focused work with new methods. The near-complete sequence, the first for a vertebrate, greatly improves the precision of biological analyses of the human genome including studies of gene number, birth and death. Notably, the human genome seems to encode only 20,000-25,000 protein-coding genes. The genome sequence reported here should serve as a firm foundation for biomedical research in the decades ahead."

Here, we report a draft genome sequence with long-range linkage and substantial anchoring to the 21 Tetraodon chromosomes. Genome analysis provides a greatly improved fish gene catalogue, including identifying key genes previously thought to be absent in fish. Comparison with other vertebrates and a urochordate indicates that fish proteins have diverged markedly faster than their mammalian homologues. Comparison with the human genome suggests approximately 900 previously unannotated human genes. Analysis of the Tetraodon and human genomes shows that whole-genome duplication occurred in the teleost fish lineage, subsequent to its divergence from mammals. The analysis also makes it possible to infer the basic structure of the ancestral bony vertebrate genome, which was composed of 12 chromosomes, and to reconstruct much of the evolutionary history of ancient and recent chromosome rearrangements leading to the modern human karyotype."

https://openalex.org/W1989136612,"A single double-strand break (DSB) induced by HO endonuclease triggers both repair by homologous recombination and activation of the Mec1-dependent DNA damage checkpoint in budding yeast1,2,3,4,5,6. Here we report that DNA damage checkpoint activation by a DSB requires the cyclin-dependent kinase CDK1 (Cdc28) in budding yeast. CDK1 is also required for DSB-induced homologous recombination at any cell cycle stage. Inhibition of homologous recombination by using an analogue-sensitive CDK1 protein7,8 results in a compensatory increase in non-homologous end joining. CDK1 is required for efficient 5′ to 3′ resection of DSB ends and for the recruitment of both the single-stranded DNA-binding complex, RPA, and the Rad51 recombination protein. In contrast, Mre11 protein, part of the MRX complex, accumulates at unresected DSB ends. CDK1 is not required when the DNA damage checkpoint is initiated by lesions that are processed by nucleotide excision repair. Maintenance of the DSB-induced checkpoint requires continuing CDK1 activity that ensures continuing end resection. CDK1 is also important for a later step in homologous recombination, after strand invasion and before the initiation of new DNA synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1964841658,"Inflammatory substances released by mast cells induce and maintain the allergic response. Mast cell differentiation and activation are regulated, respectively, by stem cell factor (SCF; also known as Kit ligand) and by allergen in complex with allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE). Activated SCF receptors and high-affinity receptors for IgE (FcvarepsilonRI) engage phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI(3)Ks) to generate intracellular lipid second messenger signals. Here, we report that genetic or pharmacological inactivation of the p110delta isoform of PI(3)K in mast cells leads to defective SCF-mediated in vitro proliferation, adhesion and migration, and to impaired allergen-IgE-induced degranulation and cytokine release. Inactivation of p110delta protects mice against anaphylactic allergic responses. These results identify p110delta as a new target for therapeutic intervention in allergy and mast-cell-related pathologies."

https://openalex.org/W2085270765,"The functional importance of the roughly 98% of mammalian genomes not corresponding to protein coding sequences remains largely undetermined. Here we show that some large-scale deletions of the non-coding DNA referred to as gene deserts can be well tolerated by an organism. We deleted two large non-coding intervals, 1,511 kilobases and 845 kilobases in length, from the mouse genome. Viable mice homozygous for the deletions were generated and were indistinguishable from wild-type littermates with regard to morphology, reproductive fitness, growth, longevity and a variety of parameters assaying general homeostasis. Further detailed analysis of the expression of multiple genes bracketing the deletions revealed only minor expression differences in homozygous deletion and wild-type mice. Together, the two deleted segments harbour 1,243 non-coding sequences conserved between humans and rodents (more than 100 base pairs, 70% identity). Some of the deleted sequences might encode for functions unidentified in our screen; nonetheless, these studies further support the existence of potentially 'disposable DNA' in the genomes of mammals."

https://openalex.org/W2050846920,"We recently reported that apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), the major protein component of high density lipoprotein, is a selective target for myeloperoxidase (MPO)-catalyzed nitration and chlorination in both and serum of subjects with cardiovascular disease. We further showed that the extent of both apoA-I nitration and chlorination correlated with functional impairment in reverse cholesterol transport activity of the isolated lipoprotein. Herein we used tandem mass spectrometry to map the sites of MPO-mediated apoA-I nitration and chlorination in vitro and in vivo and to relate the degree of site-specific modifications to loss of apoA-I lipid binding and cholesterol efflux functions. Of the seven tyrosine residues in apoA-I, Tyr-192, Tyr-166, Tyr-236, and Tyr-29 were nitrated and chlorinated in MPO-mediated reactions. Site-specific liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry quantitative analyses demonstrated that the favored modification site following exposure to MPO-generated oxidants is Tyr-192. MPO-dependent nitration and chlorination both proceed with Tyr-166 as a secondary site and with Tyr-236 and Tyr-29 modified only minimally. Parallel functional studies demonstrated dose-dependent losses of ABCA1-dependent cholesterol acceptor and lipid binding activities with apoA-I modification by MPO. Finally tandem mass spectrometry analyses showed that apoA-I in human atherosclerotic tissue is nitrated at the MPO-preferred sites, Tyr-192 and Tyr-166. The present studies suggest that site-specific modifications of apoA-I by MPO are associated with impaired lipid binding and ABCA1-dependent cholesterol acceptor functions, providing a molecular mechanism that likely contributes to the clinical link between MPO levels and cardiovascular disease risk.

Oxidatively modified LDL, but not native LDL, is taken up by macrophages via scavenger receptors that are not regulated by cellular cholesterol content to produce cholesterol-laden foam cells. Although the exact mechanisms of LDL oxidation that are proatherogenic in vivo are not known, myeloperoxidase (MPO)-mediated modification appears to be a likely contributor to the process (17Podrez E.A. Schmitt D. Hoff H.F. Hazen S.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 1547-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). MPO is a heme peroxidase that is produced by various phagocytes and utilizes hydrogen peroxide and chloride to generate chlorinating oxidants like HOCl to kill pathogens (18Hazen S.L. Hsu F.F.

Unlike LDL, however, HDL has antiatherosclerotic effects related to the maintenance of vascular homeostasis (26Ansell B.J. Navab M. Hama S. Kamranpour N. Fonarow G. Hough G. Rahmani S. Mottahedeh R.

One major antiatherosclerotic function of HDL is its participation in the reverse cholesterol transport process by acting as an acceptor of free cholesterol taken from peripheral tissues for ultimate delivery to the liver and other steroidogenic tissues. Several laboratories have reported that the oxidation of HDL in vitro alters its cholesterol acceptor function with both enhancement and inhibition in efflux noted, depending upon the oxidation system used (29Francis G.A.

Until recently, whether or not the major protein component of HDL, apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), was oxidized in vivo and if so by which pathway(s) were unknown. We have recently showed that apoA-I is a selective target for nitration and chlorination in human serum and within human atherosclerotic lesions (35Zheng L. Nukuna B. Brennan M-L. Sun M. Goormastic M. Settle M. Schmitt D. Fu X. Thomson L Fox P.L. Ischiropoulos H. Smith J.D. Kinter M. Hazen S.L. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 529-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Those experiments also found that serum apoA-I nitrotyrosine and chlorotyrosine content is increased in subjects with cardiovascular disease and that, in apoA-I isolated from cardiovascular disease patients, higher degrees of modification were inversely correlated with lower ABCA1-dependent reverse cholesterol transport activity of the lipoprotein particle (35Zheng L. Nukuna B. Brennan M-L. Sun M. Goormastic M. Settle M. Schmitt D. Fu X. Thomson L Fox P.L. Ischiropoulos H. Smith J.D. Kinter M. Hazen S.L. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 529-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Finally those studies showed that MPO selectively associates with apoA-I under physiologic conditions, such as in serum and within human atheroma, presumably through a specific interaction site mapped to the helix 8 region of the apoA-I sequence (35Zheng L. Nukuna B. Brennan M-L. Sun M. Goormastic M. Settle M. Schmitt D. Fu X. Thomson L Fox P.L. Ischiropoulos H. Smith J.D. Kinter M. Hazen S.L. J. Clin.

Singh P. McDonald T.O. Brunzell J. Chait A. Oram J.F. O'Brien K. Geary R.L. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol.

The purpose of the present studies was to establish the molecular events associated with MPO-mediated modification of apoA-I and specifically relate those events to alterations of apoA-I function. We mapped the sites of MPO-mediated nitration and chlorination with tandem mass spectrometry and now demonstrate the specific modification of two regions of the protein. We also established the hierarchy of modifications and report a co-localization of the preferred residue modified by both MPO-catalyzed chlorination and nitration with the previously identified MPO interaction site in the helix 8 region. A strong correlation was noted between dose-dependent progression of MPO-mediated site-specific modifications of apoA-I and loss of both ABCA1-dependent reverse cholesterol transport and inhibition of apoA1 lipid binding. We also showed that peroxynitrite (ONOO-) preferentially nitrates apoA-I at a site distinct from that modified by MPO and with no significant functional impairment in cholesterol efflux activity of the lipoprotein. Finally we used our in vitro observations to design targeted LC-tandem MS experiments that directly detected the nitration and chlorination of specific tyrosine residues in apoA-I isolated from human atheroma tissue. As a result, our data suggest a link between the degree of MPO-catalyzed site-specific apoA-I modifications and the loss of important antiatherosclerotic functions of HDL. MPO-catalyzed oxidative modification of apoA-I in the artery wall may thus contribute to the clinical association between MPO and cardiovascular disease. Whole blood was drawn from healthy donors who gave written informed consent for a study protocol approved by the institutional review board of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. HDL was isolated from human plasma (density range, 1.063–1.210 g/ml) using differential ultracentrifugation and extensively dialyzed in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) with 100 μm diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) in the dark at 4 °C. Delipidated and purified apoA-I was purchased from Biodesign International (Saco, ME) and used without further purification. The MPO-mediated modification reactions were carried out in a 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 100 μm DTPA, 1 mg/ml protein (apoA-I), 57 nm purified human MPO (donor: hydrogen peroxide, oxidoreductase, EC 1.11.1.7; A430/A280 ratio of 0.79), and either 1 mm nitrite (for the nitration reactions) or 100 mm chloride (for the chlorination reactions). The myeloperoxidase reactions were initiated by adding hydrogen peroxide at varying concentrations (0–200 μm) and carried out at 37 °C for 1 h. These reaction conditions included physiologically relevant amounts of MPO, chloride, and nitrite and hydrogen peroxide concentrations that ranged from physiologic to pathologic. The peroxynitrite and HOCl reactions were similarly carried out at 37 °C for 1 h in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 100 μm DTPA with the peroxynitrite and HOCl added to give final concentrations between 0 and 200 μm. In all reactions, the concentrations of the key reactants were verified spectrophotometrically using molar extinction coefficients of 170 cm-1 mm-1 at 430 nm for MPO, 39.4 cm-1m-1 at 240 nm for hydrogen peroxide, 350 cm-1m-1 at 292 nm for HOCl (NaOCl), and 1670 cm-1m-1 at 302 nm for peroxynitrite. The modified proteins were taken immediately for the apoA-I functional studies described below. An aliquot of each reaction was removed, precipitated with acetone, and separated by SDS-PAGE for the mass spectrometry experiments. Protein Digestion—The protein bands were digested according to an in-gel digestion procedure (37Kinter M. Sherman N.E. Protein Sequencing and Identification Using Tandem Mass Spectrometry. John Wiley and Sons, New York2000Crossref Google Scholar). Briefly the protein bands were cut from the gel and washed in 50% ethanol, 5% acetic acid prior to tryptic digestion with a modified, sequencing grade trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) overnight at room temperature. The peptides were extracted from the gel, evaporated to dryness, and reconstituted in either 1% acetic acid or 0.1% formic acid for analysis by capillary column HPLC-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. Identification of the Modification Sites—The detailed mapping and detection of the nitration and chlorination sites was carried out using an LCQ Deca ion trap mass spectrometer system (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA) equipped with a nanospray ionization source (Protana, Odense, Denmark). The source was operated under microspray conditions at a flow rate of 200 nl/min. The digests were analyzed by reversed-phase capillary HPLC using a 50-μm-inner diameter column with a 15-μm-inner diameter tip purchased from New Objective Corp. (Woburn, MA). The column was packed with ∼6 cm of C18 packing material (Phenomenex, Torrence, CA) and eluted using a 45-min gradient of increasing acetonitrile (2–70%) in 50 mm acetic acid. The data were acquired in the data-dependent mode, recording a mass spectrum and three collision-induced dissociation (CID) spectra in repetitive cycles (37Kinter M. Sherman N.E. Protein Sequencing and Identification Using Tandem Mass Spectrometry. John Wiley and Sons, New York2000Crossref Google Scholar). The program Sequest was used to compare all CID spectra recorded with the sequence of human apoA-I (National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) accession number 229513) and considering the appropriate changes in the tyrosine residue masses of +34 Da for chlorination and +45 Da for nitration. Site-specific quantitation experiments were performed on a QToFmicro-mass spectrometry system (Waters, Milford, MA) equipped with a CapLC HPLC system (Waters) with autoinjector. The electrospray ionization source was operated under microspray conditions at a flow rate of 600 nl/min. The digests were analyzed by reversed-phase capillary HPLC using a 75-μm-inner diameter column with a 19-μm-inner diameter nanospray source capillary. The column was packed with ∼15 cm of 10-μm C18 packing material (Phenomenex) and eluted using a 45-min gradient of increasing acetonitrile (2–70%) in 0.1% formic acid. Quantitation was achieved by using the Native Reference Peptide method developed for the site-specific quantitation of post-translational modifications (38Willard B.B. Ruse C.I. Keightley J.A. Bond M. Kinter M. Anal. Chem. 2003; 75: 2370-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 39Ruse C.I. Willard B. Jin J.P. Haas T. Kinter M. Bond M. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 1658-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) in the selected ion monitoring mode. For the selected ion monitoring experiments, full scans from m/z 300 to m/z 1600 were acquired with the time-of-flight mass analyzer of the quadrupole time-of-flight instrument, and mass chromatograms were constructed based on the m/z value of the different peptide ions of interest. The apoA-I peptides ATEHLSTLSEK and QGLLPVLESFK were used as native reference peptides. The relative quantity of each analyte peptide was determined by dividing the chromatographic peak area of that analyte peptide by the chromatographic peak area of the reference peptide. Cholesterol Efflux—The cholesterol efflux experiments were performed according to established procedures (40Smith J.D. Miyata M. Ginsberg M. Grigaux C. Shmookler E. Plump A.S. J. Biol.

The [3H]cholesterol-labeled AcLDL was prepared by incubating [3H]cholesterol for 30 min at 37 °C with the AcLDL and diluted in DGGB to give a final concentration of 50 μg/ml AcLDL with 0.33 μCi/ml [3H]cholesterol. The day after labeling, the cells were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.2% bovine serum albumin and incubated with 0.5 ml of DGGB with or without 0.1 mm 8-Br-cAMP for 16 h. After the 16-h incubation, 50 μg/ml HDL protein in 0.5 ml of DGGB with or without 8-Br-cAMP was added to each well. After a 4-h incubation at 37 °C, 100 μl of medium was removed and centrifuged, and the radioactivity was counted as a measure of the effluxed cholesterol in the media. The respective cells from each well were extracted with hexane/isopropanol (3:2, v/v), and the radioactivity was determined as a measure of the cholesterol retained in the cell. The percentage of cholesterol effluxed was calculated as the radioactivity in the medium divided by the total radioactivity (medium radioactivity plus cell radioactivity). Lipid Binding—An LDL aggregation assay, modified from a previously described assay (42Liu H. Scraba D.G. Ryan R.O. FEBS Lett. 1993; 316: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), was used to test apoA-I lipid binding. In a 96-well assay plate, 75 μg of LDL was mixed with or without 3 μg of control or modified apoA-I in a final volume of 200 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, with 150 mm NaCl and 2 mm CaCl2). Each reaction was performed in triplicate. The plate was then incubated in a SpectraMax plate reader (Amersham Biosciences) at 37 °C for 10 min. A 20-μl aliquot of diluted phospholipase C, derived from Bacillus cereus (Sigma catalog number P7147) and sufficient to induce aggregation in 1 h, or a buffer control was added to each well to hydrolyze the phospholipid polar head groups to make the LDL surface hydrophobic and initiate aggregation. Aggregation at 37 °C was monitored by absorbance at 478 nm, read every 2 min for a period of 1 h. ApoA-I lipid binding activity results in the inhibition of the LDL aggregation and was calculated from the aggregation rate (ΔA/min) during the rapid phase that occurred after a short time lag. The aggregation rate for the modified apoA-I was normalized to the rate of native apoA-I. ApoA-I Isolation—Human atheroma tissue was isolated from aortas obtained at autopsy within 10 h of death. The tissue was immediately rinsed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 100 μm DTPA and immediately frozen in 65 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, with 100 μm DTPA and 100 μm butylated hydroxytoluene under N2 at -80 °C until analysis. The DTPA was included as a metal chelator, and butylated hydroxytoluene was included as an antioxidant to prevent artifactual oxidation of the sample during the subsequent handling steps. Fatty streaks and intermediate lesions of human thoracic aorta were powdered using a stainless steel mortar and pestle at liquid nitrogen temperatures and mixed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 100 μm DTPA and a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma catalog number P8340) for 10 h at 4 °C. The suspended lesion sample was centrifuged, and the supernatant was used for apoA-I purification. For the purification, apoA-I was bound to an anti-HDL IgY resin (GenWay Biotech, San Diego, CA) and eluted in 0.1 m glycine (pH 2.5), and the eluate was neutralized by addition of 1 m Tris (pH 8.0). The neutralized sample was dissolved in sample loading buffer without heating, run in a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Criterion, Bio-Rad), and detected by Coomassie Blue staining. The SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that >90% of the protein recovered from the column was apoA-I. LC-Tandem MS Analysis—The immunoaffinity-isolated apoA-I band was cut from the gel and digested with trypsin as described above. The LC-tandem MS experiments used a ThermoFinnigan LTQ linear ion trap mass spectrometer with a Surveyor HPLC pump and autosampler system. Samples were injected onto a 10-cm × 75-μm-inner diameter capillary column that was eluted with a linear gradient of acetonitrile in 50 mm acetic acid at ∼1 μl/min. Selected reaction monitoring experiments were used to record the product ion spectra of molecular ions of peptides containing each modified tyrosine residue characterized in the mapping experiments. Chromatograms for those peptides were reconstructed by plotting the fragmentation of the molecular ions to the most abundant product ions in the respective CID spectra. Detection of the appropriate peptide was verified by the CID spectrum that was recorded at that retention time. Statistically significant differences were determined by either a one-way analysis of variance using a Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons test or a Student's t test. Statistical significant differences are reported when p < 0.05. Mapping the Nitration and Chlorination Sites in ApoA-I— Initial experiments focused on determining the tyrosine nitration sites in apoA-I produced by treating HDL with both an enzymatic modification system (MPO/H2O2/NO2−) with varying concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and a non-enzymatic system using varying concentrations of peroxynitrite. After each treatment, the proteins in HDL were precipitated with cold acetone and separated by SDS-PAGE, and the apoA-I band was cut from the gel for in-gel digestion with trypsin. The digest was analyzed by capillary column HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry using the data-dependent mode of the ion trap mass spectrometry system. Approximately 2000 CID spectra were recorded, and these spectra were searched for the spectra of modified peptides. The search routine was focused on the amino acid sequence of apoA-I and used a tyrosine residue mass difference of +45 Da to find the spectra of the nitrated peptides. These analyses detected peptides that covered 95% of the protein sequence, including peptides that contained all seven of the tyrosine residues in the mature apoA-I sequence. Two peptides containing nitrotyrosine residues (Tyr-192 and Tyr-166) were found in HDL treated with MPO/H2O2/NO2− at concentrations of hydrogen peroxide <50 μm. At higher hydrogen peroxide concentrations (>100 μm), additional nitrotyrosine-containing peptides (Tyr-29 and Tyr-236) could also be detected. The three remaining tyrosine residues are contained in peptides that were detected and sequenced in these analyses, but no corresponding nitrated form was found under any reaction condition that was tested. As a comparison, a similar reaction of HDL with 100 μm peroxynitrite gave nitrotyrosine modifications of the apoA-I at three tyrosine residues: Tyr-166, Tyr-18, and Tyr-236. Again the remaining tyrosine residues were detected in these analyses exclusively in the un-nitrated form. The CID spectra of the five nitrated peptides are shown in Fig. 1. For each peptide, the identity was established by the series of product ions recorded in the respective CID spectrum. A component of these CID spectra is the characteristic residue mass of the nitrotyrosine moiety (208 Da). Overall the combination of the peptide molecular weight measurements, the peptide sequence information in the CID spectra, and the known apoA-I amino acid sequence allowed unambiguous assignment of the nitrotyrosine positions.Fig. 4Dose-dependent apoA-I nitration and the impairment of reverse cholesterol transport activity. HDL was nitrated in a series of either MPO/H2O2/NO2− reactions with increasing amounts of H2O2 or peroxynitrite as indicated for 1.5 h. A, the effect of the nitration reactions on the ABCA1-dependent reverse cholesterol efflux of the HDL. The modified HDL from each reaction was subsequently incubated with murine RAW264.7 macrophages loaded with [3H]cholesterol-labeled AcLDL. These cells were treated with the modified HDL in the presence of cAMP to measure the ABCA1-dependent component of reverse cholesterol transport. After 4 h, media and cellular 3H was counted, and the percent efflux was calculated as the amount of [3H]cholesterol in the media divided by the total [3H]cholesterol (media + cel"

We have identified an Arabidopsis UBX domain-containing protein, PUX1, which functions to regulate the oligomeric structure of the Arabidopsis homolog of p97/CDC48, AtCDC48, as well as mammalian p97. PUX1 is a soluble protein that co-fractionates with non-hexameric AtCDC48 and physically interacts with AtCDC48 in vivo. Binding of PUX1 to AtCDC48 is mediated through the UBX-containing C-terminal domain. However, disassembly of the chaperone is dependent upon the N-terminal domain of PUX1. These findings provide evidence that the assembly and disassembly of the hexameric p97/CDC48 complex is a dynamic process. This new unexpected level of regulation for p97/CDC48 was demonstrated to be critical in vivo as pux1 loss-of-function mutants display accelerated growth relative to wild-type plants. These results suggest a role for AtCDC48 and PUX1 in regulating plant growth. p97/CDC48 is a highly abundant hexameric AAA-ATPase that functions as a molecular chaperone in numerous diverse cellular activities.

AAA proteins are characterized by the presence of one (type I) or two (type II) ATPase domains containing the Walker A and B motifs that are responsible for ATP binding and hydrolysis, respectively. The active form of many family members are ring-shaped oligomers, typically hexamers, that undergo conformational changes upon binding and hydrolysis of ATP. p97/CDC48 is an abundant type II hexameric AAA protein that functions in numerous diverse cellular activities including homotypic fusion of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi membranes (5Latterich M.

The functional versatility of p97/CDC48 appears to be mediated by multiple adapter/regulatory proteins that dictate the substrate specificity of this molecular chaperone. In the fusion of mammalian ER and Golgi membranes, a p97/CDC48 complex containing the adapter protein, p47, interacts with the t-SNARE, syntaxin 5 (6Rabouille C. Levine T.P. Peters J.M. Warren G.

Mammalian p97, p47, and another cofactor, the heterodimeric complex, Ufd1-Npl4, have also been found to regulate sequential steps during nuclear envelope assembly (13Hetzer M. Meyer H.H. Walther T.C.

Interestingly, p97/CDC48, the p97/CDC48-p47 complex, and Ufd1-Npl4 bind mono- and/or polyubiquitin chains (12Ye Y. Meyer H.H. Rapoport T.A. J.

It remains to be determined how their interaction with ubiquitin contributes to two seemingly distinct processes such as Golgi assembly and protein degradation. Binding of p47, Ufd1-Npl4, and another recently identified p97/CDC48 adapter, SVIP (29Nagahama M. Suzuki M. Hamada Y. Hatsuzawa K. Tani K. Yamamoto A. Tagaya M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 262-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), which is required for the maintenance of ER integrity, is mutually exclusive. These proteins appear bind to the N-terminal domains of p97/CDC48 thereby coupling the outside edge of the active hexameric barrel to its targets. In the case of p47, binding of the protein to the N terminus of p97/CDC48 is mediated through two contiguous sites; a C-terminal UBX domain and middle ∼100 amino acid region (amino acids 171–270) of undetermined structure (30Yuan X.

The domain is located typically at the C terminus. Recent work has shown that the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome encodes 7 UBX-containing proteins including the putative yeast ortholog of p47, Shp1p (21Kondo H. Rabouille C. Newman R. Levine T.P. Pappin D. Freemont P. Warren G. Nature. 1997; 388: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), the yeast Cui1–3p protein family, which are required for sporulation (32Decottignies A. Evain A. Ghislain M. Yeast. 2004; 21: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and proteins designated Ubx2, Ubx3, and Ubx5 (33Schuberth C. Richly H. Rumpf S. Buchberger A. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 818-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Similar to p47, all of the yeast UBX-containing proteins bind to CDC48 via UBX domains (32Decottignies A. Evain A. Ghislain M. Yeast. 2004; 21: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 33Schuberth C. Richly H. Rumpf S. Buchberger A. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 818-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Structural studies of the UBX domain of the human Fas-associated factor-1 (FAF1) (34Buchberger A. Howard M.J. Proctor M. Bycroft M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and p47 (30Yuan X. Shaw A. Zhang X. Kondo H. Lally J. Freemont P.S. Matthews S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) have shown that the UBX domain adopts a characteristic ubiquitin fold. In contrast to ubiquitin, the UBX domain lacks the C-terminal double glycine motif necessary for conjugation to target proteins. Our previous studies have suggested that the plant orthologs of p97/CDC48 and another structurally related member of the AAA ATPase, the N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein, NSF, function in distinct membrane fusion pathways at the plane of cell division to mediate plant cytokinesis (35Rancour D.M. Dickey C.E. Park S. Bednarek S.Y. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 1241-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The Arabidopsis p97/CDC48 and syntaxin 5 orthologs, AtCDC48 and SYP31, respectively, were found to colocalize at the division plane during cytokinesis and to interact in vitro and in vivo. To characterize further the function of AtCDC48 and SYP31 we have utilized affinity chromatography and MALDI-MS to identify plant proteins that interact with SYP31 and/or modulate the activity of AtCDC48. Here we show that one member of the plant UBX domain-containing protein family (PUX), PUX1, regulates AtCDC48 by inhibiting its ATPase activity and by promoting the disassembly of the active hexamer. Phenotypic analysis of pux1 plants revealed that the loss of PUX1 accelerated the growth of various plant organs including roots and inflorescence shoots. These results suggest that PUX1 functions as a regulator of AtCDC48 and that the activity of these two proteins is required for various cellular pathways important for plant growth and development. Affinity Chromatography, MALDI-Mass Spectrometry, and Protein Identification—GST and GST-SYP31-(41–281ΔTM) were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as before (35Rancour D.M. Dickey C.E.

Unbound material was removed and the column washed with 10 column volumes of TBS. The protein was coupled covalently to the resin using 20 mm dimethyl pimelimidate (DMP) in 200 mm sodium borate, pH 8.8, and quenched with Tris buffer as described previously (36Bar-Peled M.

Arabidopsis T87 suspension-cultured cell cytosol (T87 S150) was prepared as described (S150′; Rancour et al., Ref. 35Rancour D.M. Dickey C.E. Park S. Bednarek S.Y.

For the identification of AtCDC48/SYP31-interacting protein, immobilized GST/GST-SYP31 glutathione-Sepharose was incubated with S150 protein in binding buffer (MIB+DTT+PIC plus 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 and 1 mm ATP) at 4 °C for 1.5 h in 5-ml final volume at a final protein ratio of 0.25 mg of GST/GST-SYP31:13 mg of S150 protein. Bound protein complexes were collected by centrifugation of the resin and removal of unbound solution. The beads were washed with 9 ml of MIBDTT+0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and the final wash solution was removed with a 27-gauge needle and syringe. Protein was eluted from the beads with MIBDTT+0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 + 250 mm NaCl by incubation 25 min at 22 °C and then stored at –20 °C. Proteins were precipitated using trichloroacetic acid (10% w/v final), solubilized in 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and analyzed by preparative discontinuous SDS-PAGE (4% stacking; 10% resolving). Proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. Protein bands specific to GST-SYP31 but not present in the GST control sample were excised, washed, reduced with DTT, alkylated with iodoacetamide, digested with trypsin (sequencing grade; Promega, Madison, WI), and resulting peptides eluted and dried according to Jimenez et al.

PUX1 binding assays contained 10 μg/ml of purified AAA-ATPase in ATPase binding buffer (ATPaseBB: 20 mm HEPES/KOH pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100). The concentration of AtCDC48 in T87 cytosol (S150) was quantified by immunoblotting and scanning densitometry using E. coli expressed His6-T7-AtCDC48 as a standard. Therefore, 275 μg of S150 protein containing 1 μg (11.2 pmol) of AtCDC48 was utilized. Purified E. coli-expressed GST-PUX1 constructs were added in molar ratios to AtCDC48 of 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 mol and ratios of 1 and 2 for p97 and NSF, respectively. Reactions were incubated on ice for 30 min followed by affinity isolation using glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin. Bound complexes were washed three times with ATPaseBB and processed for SDS-PAGE. AtCDC48 samples were processed for immunoblotting with anti-AtCDC48 antibodies. NSF and p97 protein samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie R-250. Characterization of the Oligomeric Structure of AtCDC48/PUX1 Complexes—E. coli-expressed His6-AtCDC48, His6-p97, and GST-free PUX1 were used to examine the effect of GST-free PUX1 on the oligomeric status of these AAA-ATPases. To test the effect of full-length and PUX1-domain fragments on the oligomeric status of AtCDC48 and p97, PUX1-derived proteins were mixed with the AAA-ATPase at molar ratios of 1:3, 1:1, and 3:1 PUX1:AAA-ATPase and incubated in the absence or presence of exogenous nucleotides (1 mm final concentration for ATP, ADP, or AMP-PNP) for 30 min on ice prior to sucrose gradient fractionation. 30 μg of total protein was fractionated on a 5-ml 20–40% (w/w) sucrose gradient (20 mm HEPES/KOH pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Gradients were centrifuged at 128,000 × g in a SW50.1 rotor (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) for 18 h at 4 °C. The protein sedimentation standards used included ovalbumin (3.6 S, 43.5 kDa), bovine serum albumin (4.4 S, 66 kDa), and apoferritin (17.7S, 480 kDa). Standards were run on gradients parallel to samples. In addition, the refractive indices for gradient fractions were used to cross-reference peak assignments between gradients. Fractions were collected and analyzed as described (35Rancour D.M. Dickey C.E. Park S. Bednarek S.Y. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 1241-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).

Busse J.S. Dickey C. Rancour D.M. Bednarek S.Y. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 47-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The amplified product was cloned into pGEM-T easy (Promega) and sequenced using primers SB93 and SB94. An E. coli protein expression vector was constructed by subcloning an EcoRI PUX1 fragment from pGEMT-easy/PUX1-cDNA into pGEX4T-3 (Amersham Biosciences). This strategy resulted in the addition of 5 amino acids (DSLVI), encoded by flanking nucleotide sequence derived from the pGEMT-easy vector, into the linker between the GST and the N terminus of the PUX1. pGEX4T-3-PUX1 was expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLys at 37 °C using 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 3 h and affinity-purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B as described (35Rancour D.M.

E. coli-expressed GST-free PUX1 was generated from GST-PUX1 using a thrombin cleavage capture kit (Novagen). Protein samples were stored as aliquots at –80 °C. Polyclonal rabbit antibodies were generated against the GST-PUX1 fusion protein at Covance Research Products Inc. (Denver, PA) using standard protocols. Antiserum was cleared of anti-GST antibodies followed by affinity purification of anti-PUX1 antibodies on a DMP-coupled GST-PUX1/glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin as described (35Rancour D.M.

Arabidopsis T87 Subcellular Fractionation and PUX1 Purification— Protocols for subcellular and glycerol gradient fractionation of Arabidopsis cytosol were performed as described (35Rancour D.M. Dickey C.E. Park S. Bednarek S.Y. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 1241-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). For co-immunoprecipitation of PUX1 and AtCDC48, affinity-purified anti-PUX1 antibodies were bound and coupled chemically to Protein A-Sepharose beads at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml using DMP as above. Arabidopsis S150 (100 μg of protein) in MIB was cross-linked chemically using 0.5 mm 3,3′-dithio bis(sulfo-succinimidylpropionate) (DTSSP; fresh stock in dH2O; Pierce) for 30 min at 4 °C. Reactions were quenched by the addition of Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (final concentration of 50 mm) followed by a 20-min incubation at 4 °C. PUX1-containing protein complexes were immunoisolated using conjugated anti-PUX1 antibody protein-A-Sepharose (2 μg of antibody per reaction). Isolated protein complexes were washed three times with MIB, solubilized in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer supplemented with 100 mm DTT and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting against either AtCDC48 or PUX1. Immunoblot detection was performed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, ECL chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences), and exposure to film (Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Cloning and E. coli Protein Expression of His-tagged AtCDC48 and PUX1 Truncation Mutants—A His6-T7 epitope tag was generated by primer extension using complementary primers SB405 and SB406, and ligated into a SmaI restriction site 74-bp upstream of the endogenous translational start site of AtCDC48A in pPZP211 (41Hajdukiewicz P. Svab Z. Maliga P. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 989-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding His6-T7-tagged AtCDC48 was PCR-amplified using primers SB439/SB371, TA-cloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega) and sequenced using primers SB40, 42, 43, 62, 149, 407, and 408. A NdeI/NotI restriction fragment containing the His6-T7-AtCDC48 cDNA was cloned into pET29A for protein expression in E. coli. His6-T7-AtCDC48A protein was expressed in the ROSETTA (Novagen) strain of E. coli at 28 °C using 100 μm IPTG for 3 h and purified using Ni-NTA (Qiagen) as described (27Meyer H.H. Shorter J.G. Seemann J. Pappin D. Warren G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2181-2192Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) with the exception that 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol was used instead of DTT. GST-PUX1 truncation mutant constructs were generated by PCR amplification of cDNA fragments from pGEX4T-3-PUX1. Fragments were cloned into a modified pGEX4T-3 vector with a Tev protease cleavage site (pGEX4T-3-TEV) (42Chook Y.M. Jung A. Rosen M.K. Blobel G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6955-6966Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) using either BamHI/SalI or BamHI/EcoRI. The mutants were generated by PCR amplification using the following oligonucleotide sets: (a) N terminus (amino acids 1–100; primers SB227 and SB483), (b) UBX (amino acids 100–181; primers SB502 and SB484), (c) C terminus (amino acids 181–251; primers SB503 and SB228), (d) N terminus+UBX (amino acids 1–181; primers SB227 and SB484), and (e) UBX+C terminus (amino acids 100–251; primers SB502 and SB228). Proteins were expressed in ROSETTA E. coli at 37 °C using 100 μm IPTG induction for 3 h and affinity-purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B as described above. GST-free forms were generated by TEV protease treatment of glutathione-Sepharose bound GST fusion proteins in TBS pH7.4 overnight at 22 °C at a mass ratio of 1 μg of recombinant His6-TEV to 20 μg GST-protein. Recombinant His6-TEV was removed using Ni-NTA agarose, and the GST-free proteins were quantified and stored at –80 °C. The purity of all E. coli-expressed proteins was assessed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Kinetic Analysis of AtCDC48 Enzyme Activity—Kinetic analysis was performed with purified His6-T7-AtCDC48A protein expressed in E. coli. 50-μl assays were performed with 0.3 μg (0.067 μm) of His6-T7-AtCDC48A protein in reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES/NaOH pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT) with the specified ATP concentrations (0.05–0.2 mm) at 22 °C. Colorimetric detection of phosphate product release was performed as described (43Rowlands M.G. Newbatt Y.M. Prodromou C. Pearl L.H. Workman P. Aherne W. Anal.

Inhibition studies with purified E. coli-expressed GST-free PUX1 (0.048–0.576 μg of PUX1 protein; 0.034–0.402 μm) were performed using 15-min fixed point assays under reaction conditions described above. Isolation of pux1 T-DNA Insertion Mutants—PCR-based identification of T-DNA insertions in PUX1 was performed as described (44Krysan P.J. Young J.C. Tax F. Sussman M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Two independent insertion lines were identified in the Alpha population lines present at the Arabidopsis Knock-out Facility (Biotechnology Center, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI) using gene-specific PCR primers SB223 and SB224 and the T-DNA left border primer JL202 (SB58). DNA sequencing of the PCR-amplified products determined the T-DNA insertion positions within PUX1. Heterozygous pux1 plants were backcrossed to wild-type WS ecotype plants. Mutiplex PCR using primers SB223, 224, and 58 was used to confirm the genotypes of segregating plants. Plant Growth and Analysis—Surface-sterilized seed were either plated on"

https://openalex.org/W2080964493,"Cell adhesion molecules regulate a variety of endothelial cell functions such as migration, response to inflammation, and angiogenesis. Recently, activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM), a member of the Ig superfamily, has been detected in the primitive subsets of hematopoietic cells and endothelial cells during embryogenesis. ALCAM supports the development of hematopoietic cells as well as enhancing capillary tube formation in vitro. Here, we isolated a novel soluble isoform of ALCAM (sALCAM) that is produced via alternative splicing. sALCAM contains the single amino-terminal Ig-like domain of ALCAM and lacks a transmembrane domain. When expressed in cultured cells, sALCAM was properly secreted into the media. Both ALCAM and sALCAM are expressed in a variety of cultured human endothelial cells. Notably, their transcripts were differentially regulated in human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC) upon tumor necrosis factor-α stimulation. ALCAM significantly enhanced tube formation of endothelial-like yolk sac cells on Matrigel, whereas it inhibited their migration in vitro. sALCAM completely abolished these effects of ALCAM. Furthermore, sALCAM enhanced migration of mock-transfected endothelial-like yolk sac cells that do not express ALCAM, indicating that sALCAM has an independent effect on cell migration in addition to modulating ALCAM function. In addition, sALCAM significantly enhanced migration of HMVEC, whereas it inhibited tube formation of HMVEC on Matrigel. sALCAM demonstrated an ability to bind ALCAM and partially inhibited ALCAM-ALCAM homophilic interactions. Taken together, these data characterize a novel soluble isoform of ALCAM that may have ALCAM-dependent and ALCAM-independent functions, providing further insights regarding the role of this adhesion molecule in the regulation of endothelial cell function.

The major component of blood vessels is a single layer of endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells or mural cells. Secreted and membrane proteins expressed in endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells play particular roles in the physiology and pathophysiology of blood vessels. To identify secreted and membrane proteins expressed in endothelial cells, we performed signal sequence trap screening using a retrovirus-based expression cDNA library of human microvascular endothelial cells. One of the genes isolated encoded a novel putative secretory isoform of activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM), 1The abbreviations used are: ALCAM, activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule; sALCAM, soluble isoform of ALCAM; IL, interleukin; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; HMVEC, human lung microvascular endothelial cells; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; sCAM, soluble cell adhesion molecules.1The abbreviations used are: ALCAM, activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule; sALCAM, soluble isoform of ALCAM; IL, interleukin; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; HMVEC, human lung microvascular endothelial cells; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; sCAM, soluble cell adhesion molecules. also known as BEN, SC1, DM-GRASP, MEMD, HCA, and CD166 (1Pourquie O.

ALCAM is a type I membrane protein that belongs to the Ig superfamily, and it has five extracellular variable type and constant type Ig domains and a single transmembrane domain. Human ALCAM was initially isolated as a ligand of CD6, a cell surface receptor belonging to the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich protein superfamily (6Patel D.D. Wee S.F. Whichard L.P. Bowen M.A. Pesando J.M. Aruffo A. Haynes B.F. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1563-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). CD6 is expressed on the surface of mature T cell and chronic B cell lymphocytic leukemia. Expression of CD6 on T cells is up-regulated following activation, and previous reports suggest that CD6 modulates T cell receptor signaling (7Aruffo A. Bowen M.A. Patel D.D. Haynes B.F. Starling G.C. Gebe J.A. Bajorath J. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 498-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Therefore, binding of ALCAM to CD6 suggests that ALCAM may be involved in immune and/or inflammatory responses. In addition, ALCAM has been detected in a variety of cell types where it participates in heterophilic interactions with unknown ligands as well as homophilic interactions, suggesting that ALCAM has varied functions (8DeBernardo A.P. Chang S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 9Swart G.W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 81: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In fact, BEN/SC1/DM-GRASP, a chicken homologue of ALCAM, is expressed in the nervous systems and plays a role in axogenesis, neurite elongation, and synapse formation (2Burns F.R. von Kannen S. Guy L. Raper J.A. Kamholz J. Chang S. Neuron. 1991; 2: 209-220Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 10DeBernardo A.P. Chang S. Dev.

Although ALCAM is expressed in a variety of cell types and tissues, it is certainly expressed in subsets of cells involved in dynamic growth and migration, including developing neuronal cells, hematopoietic cells. Although its physiological function is still unclear, its unique expression pattern suggests that ALCAM is involved in cell differentiation and migration. Recently ALCAM expression has been detected in the fairly primitive subsets of hematopoietic cells and endothelial cells during embryogenesis (12Ohneda O. Ohneda K. Arai F. Lee J. Miyamoto T. Fukushima Y. Dowbenko D. Lasky L.A. Suda T. Blood. 2001; 98: 2134-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). ALCAM supports the development of hematopoietic progenitor cells and enhances the capillary tube formation of endothelial cells, suggesting that ALCAM is involved in both vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. Here we isolated a novel soluble isoform of ALCAM (sALCAM) that is produced via alternative splicing. sALCAM demonstrated an ALCAM-independent effect in endothelial cell assays as well as a regulatory effect on ALCAM function. sALCAM mRNA expression is differentially regulated from that of ALCAM upon inflammatory stimulation. These data suggest that sALCAM may modulate endothelial function through both ALCAM-dependent and ALCAM-independent pathways. Cloning of sALCAM—Signal sequence trap was performed as previously described (13Kojima T. Kitamura T. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 487-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Briefly, a library was constructed in the retrovirus vector pMX-SST employing cDNA derived from mRNA isolated from cultured human lung microvascular endothelial cells. The pMX-SST vector has a sequence encoding the constitutively active thrombopoietin receptor (MPL) downstream of the cloning site. When constitutive active MPL is expressed on the plasma membrane, it transmits a proliferative signal. The cDNA library was transfected into Phoenix-Eco packaging cells, and retroviruses carrying cDNA were collected. Interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent pro-B (Ba/F3) cells were infected with retrovirus followed by seeding on ten 96-multiwell plates (960 wells) in the absence of IL-3. Only Ba/F3 cells expressing the constitutively active MPL at the plasma membrane were able to grow in the absence of IL-3. IL-3-independent growth of Ba/F3 cells was observed in about 300 wells. Genomic DNA was extracted from these Ba/F3 clones, and PCR was performed using genomic DNA as a template and primers specific for the cloning vector. After electrophoresis of the PCR products, DNA was recovered and subjected to sequencing. Mouse sALCAM was identified through sequence data base searches (BC027280 and NT_096987.1 were used). The nucleotide sequence of the 3′-ends of human and mouse sALCAM was determined by 3′-rapid amplification cDNA ends using total RNA from human microvascular endothelial cells and the mouse endothelial cell line C166 cells, respectively. Semiquantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized from 2.5 μg of total RNA using the SuperScript first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen). The forward primer 5′-GCTAGTAACTGAGGACAACGTG-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-GAGCTTCTTATTCCTTCGGGCTG-3′ were used for ALCAM amplification. The forward primer 5′-ATACCTTGCCGACTTGACGTACCT-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-AAAGAACATGGTCTGGTACTGGCC-3′ were used for sALCAM amplification. The forward primer 5′-CCTTCATTGACCTCAACTACATGG-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-CCTGCTTCACCACCTTCTTGAT-3′ were used for GAPDH amplification. PCR conditions were optimized so that quantification of amplified material was in the linear phase of amplification. After 3 min of incubation at 95 °C, a PCR cycle of 95 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 45 s was used. PCR cycles of 28 times, 30 times, and 26 times were performed for amplification of ALCAM, sALCAM, and GAPDH, respectively. The size of the PCR product was 543 bp, 340 bp, and 687 bp for ALCAM, sALCAM and GAPDH, respectively. Purification of sALCAM and Western Blot Analysis—The coding region of human sALCAM was subcloned into the p3XFLAG-CMV-14 expression vector (Sigma) (sALCAM-p3XFLAG) and transfected into CHO cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). 24 h after transfection, fresh growth media were provided, and cells were further incubated for 24 h. Finally, the media were collected and subjected to purification of sALCAM using the FLAG-M purification kit (Sigma). Protein concentration was measured by Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad) based on the method of Bradford using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Protein generated in this fashion was employed for in vitro assays. For Western blot analysis, sALCAM-p3XFLAG was transfected into CHO cells in the same way, and cells were lysed in the CelLytic lysis reagent (Sigma). Cell lysate and conditioned culture media were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h in the presence or absence of PNGase F (QA-Bio, San Mateo, CA) as recommended by the manufacturer. Western blot analysis was performed using anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Stratagene) as described previously (14Ikeda K. Emoto N. Matsuo M. Yokoyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3514-3520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfection—The embryonic yolk sac cell (Pro5) was cultured as described previously (15Ishida T. Kundu R.K. Yang E. Hirata K. Ho Y.D. Quertermous T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34598-34604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The coding region of human ALCAM was subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) (ALCAM-pcDNA3) and transfected into Pro5 cells using Lipofectamine 2000. Independent clones of stable transfectants were selected in the presence of 1000 μg/ml G418 (Pro 5/ALCAM). Mock transfectants were generated by transfection of empty pcDNA3 plasmid (Pro 5/MOCK). CHO cells were cultured as described previously (16Ikeda K. Emoto N. Raharjo S.B. Nurhantari Y. Saiki K. Yokoyama M. Matsuo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32469-32477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Stable transfectants of ALCAM in CHO cells were generated as for the Pro5 cells (CHO/ALCAM and CHO/MOCK). Human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC) were obtained from Clonetics (San Diego, CA) and cultured on gelatin-coated dishes. For stimulation experiments, HMVEC were cultured in EGM-2 MV media (Clonetics) until they became confluent and then incubated in the basal media without supplements for 24 h followed by stimulation with the indicated concentration of stimulant for the indicated time. Wound-healing and Modified Boyden Chamber Assay—For the wound-healing assay, Pro5/MOCK and Pro5/ALCAM stable transfectants were grown to confluence in P60 dishes. A longitudinal scrape was made in the center of the dish with a pipette tip, and cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline. The initial images of cells were captured digitally, and thereafter cells were incubated in the media containing 5% fetal bovine serum in the presence or absence of 300 ng/ml sALCAM. After 24 h of incubation, images of cells were captured again, and the migration distance of the cells at the wound edge was measured for at least five points for each group. For the modified Boyden chamber assay, transwell inserts with 8-μm pores for a 24-well plate (Costar, Acton, MA) were used. Membranes were placed into the lower chamber containing 250 μl of migration buffer (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 1% bovine serum albumin). When HMVEC were used, membranes were coated with gelatin. 8 × 104 cells were seeded on the upper chamber in 500 μl of migration buffer in the presence or absence of sALCAM at the indicated concentration. For Pro5 cells migration, no chemoattractant was examined; for HMVEC migration 50 ng/ml vascular endothelial growth factor were used to induce migration. After 4 h of incubation, non-migratory cells on the top chamber were scraped off with cotton swabs, and migratory cells on the bottom surface were fixed with methanol followed by staining with hematoxylin. Membranes were cut off from the top chamber and mounted onto slide glass, and migratory cells were counted under a microscope in at least five independent fields. In Vitro Two-dimensional Tube Formation Assay on Matrigel—In vitro angiogenesis assays on Matrigel (BD Biosciences) were performed in 24-well plates coated with 200 μl of Matrigel. 5 × 104 Pro5 cells were plated on Matrigel in growth media in the presence or absence of 300 ng/ml sALCAM and incubated for 24 h. 1 × 105 human microvascular endothelial cells were plated on Matrigel in the presence or absence of 500 ng/ml sALCAM and incubated for 15 h. Tube lengths in each group were measured in four independent fields. sALCAM Binding Assay—The cording region of human ALCAM and nucleotides encoding a myc tag at its 3′-end was subcloned into a pME-18Sf expression vector that possesses the SRα viral promotor (16Ikeda K. Emoto N. Raharjo S.B. Nurhantari Y. Saiki K. Yokoyama M. Matsuo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32469-32477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) (ALCAM-myc-pME). ALCAM-myc-pME or empty pME vector was transfected into COS-7 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). 24 h after transfection, cells were incubated with 1 or 10 μg/ml sALCAM in the fresh culture media at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were rinsed with warmed culture media three times and then lysed in the CelLytic lysis reagent (Sigma). After the measurement of protein concentration, 30 μg of each cell lysate was subjected to Western blot analysis. Cell Aggregation Assay—Cell aggregation assay was performed as described previously (17Hirata K. Ishida T. Penta K. Rezaee M. Yang E. Wohlgemuth J. Quertermous T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16223-16231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Briefly, detached CHO/MOCK and CHO/ALCAM cells were washed with Ca2+-free Hanks' balanced salt solution twice and cells were suspended in Ca2+-free Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 2% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) to a final concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml. Cell suspensions were incubated in the presence or absence of 1 or 10 μg/ml sALCAM in 1.5 ml siliconized tubes with gentle rotation on the platform rotator for 30–90 min at 37 °C. Cells were evaluated on a hemocytometer, and the aggregates consisting of more than three cells were counted. Statistics—Differences between groups were analyzed using Student's t test; p < 0.05 was considered significant. All data are presented as mean ± S.E. as indicated. Isolation of Soluble ALCAM—Because secreted and transmembrane proteins play crucial roles in endothelial cell physiology, we employed the method of signal sequence trap using mRNA from HMVEC to isolate genes encoding such proteins. We obtained several novel genes, and one of them demonstrated high similarity to ALCAM. The nucleotide sequence of the coding region was identical to human ALCAM within the first 394 nucleotides, but then the sequence homology ended. Interestingly, immediately after the 394th nucleotide, an in-frame stop codon was identified such that this clone encoded a truncated form of ALCAM. This truncated protein would have 133 amino acids identical to amino-terminal ALCAM except two carboxyl-terminal amino acids and be comprised of a variable type immunoglobulin (Ig) domain alone (Fig. 1A). Because there was no encoded transmembrane domain in this form of ALCAM, we named it soluble ALCAM (sALCAM). We also identified several cDNA sequences in the GenBank™ data base (BC057809, BC041127, and BU952023) that could encode sALCAM, supporting our findings. Analysis of the genomic structure of human and mouse sALCAM loci suggested that sALCAM mRNA is produced from the same gene via alternative splicing (Fig. 1B). To determine the 3′-end of sALCAM, we performed 3′-rapid amplification cDNA ends using total RNA from human and mouse endothelial cells. Both human and mouse sALCAM transcripts were found to end in exon 3 (intron 2 for ALCAM), and the polyadenylation signal AATAAA was observed near the 3′-ends of both human (Fig. 1C) and mouse (data not shown) sALCAM transcripts. Expression of sALCAM—We examined the cell specificity of human ALCAM and sALCAM expression using semiquantitative PCR. Both ALCAM and sALCAM were expressed in a variety of cultured human cells, including endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells (Fig. 2A). Given that more PCR cycles were required to obtain detectable levels of sALCAM DNA than were required for ALCAM, it is likely that ALCAM is expressed at higher levels than sALCAM in all cell types examined. Then we further examined their regulated expression upon stimulation of HMVEC. With stimulation by inflammatory regulators, sALCAM and sALCAM expression was measured at 4, 12, and 24 h after stimulation. TNF-α was the only regulator that increased ALCAM expression and was noted after 4 h. However its effect was not observed at 12 and 24 h. On the other hand, sALCAM expression was moderately up-regulated with TNF-α treatment after 4 h, and its effect persisted even after 24 h. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) stimulation decreased expression of both ALCAM and sALCAM after 24 h, whereas vascular endothelial growth factor treatment did not show a significant effect. These data suggest that the mechanism for producing two alternative transcripts may be regulated (Fig. 2B). Then we investigated whether sALCAM is a secreted protein. For this purpose, recombinant sALCAM was expressed in CHO cells by transient transfection. A FLAG epitope tag was added at carboxyl-terminal for the detection of recombinant protein. sALCAM was detected in the conditioned culture media as well as cell lysate, indicating that sALCAM is secreted (Fig. 3A). The molecular weight of sALCAM in the media was different from sALCAM in the cell lysate, both of which were larger than the predicted molecular weight. Because sALCAM is predicted to have two N-linked glycosylation sites, we speculated that sALCAM undergoes post-translational modification. Therefore, we treated the cell lysate and the conditioned media with an endoglycosidase, PNGase F. After the deglycosylation, sALCAM in both cell lysate and media showed the same reduced molecular weight by Western blot analysis, indicating that sALCAM is glycosylated (Fig. 3A). For further studies, we purified FLAG-tagged sALCAM protein from cell culture media, and the purity was confirmed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (Fig. 3B). sALCAM Modulates Endothelial Cell Function—To examine the functions of ALCAM and sALCAM, we generated endothelial-like yolk sac cells (Pro5) stably expressing ALCAM. Pro5 cells did not express endogenous ALCAM (data not shown). We examined the role of ALCAM and sALCAM in migration with wound-healing and modified Boyden chamber assays. Because ALCAM expression is usually restricted to subsets of cells involved in dynamic growth and/or migration, including neural development, branching organ development, hematopoiesis, immune response, and tumor progression, we expected ALCAM to enhance cell migration (9Swart G.W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 81: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). However, Pro5 cells expressing ALCAM (Pro5/ALCAM) showed less migration than mock-transfected control cells (Pro5/MOCK) by both assays (Fig. 4, A and B). Interestingly, addition of sALCAM increased cell migration not only of Pro5/ALCAM but also of Pro5/MOCK, suggesting that sALCAM has an ALCAM-independent effect on cell migration (Fig. 4B). Notably, 200 ng/ml sALCAM showed a maximum effect on Pro5/MOCK migration, whereas 1000 ng/ml sALCAM demonstrated a maximum effect on Pro5/ALCAM migration. Moreover, with 1000 ng/ml sALCAM, there was no significant difference of migration between Pro5/MOCK and Pro5/ALCAM, suggesting that at this concentration sALCAM could inhibit the ALCAM-dependent inhibitory effect on cell migration. The ALCAM-independent effect of sALCAM was not observed in the wound-healing assay, presumably because of greater variability in this assay compared with the Boyden chamber assay. We then examined ALCAM expressing cells in a tube formation assay on Matrigel. Pro5/ALCAM showed significantly enhanced tube formation compared with Pro5/MOCK. This enhancement of tube formation was also abolished by sALCAM (Fig. 4, C and D). Next we explored if sALCAM has a similar effect on human primary endothelial cells. We examined the migration and tube formation capacity of HMVEC, which highly express ALCAM, in the presence or absence of sALCAM. Similar to the results with Pro5/ALCAM, sALCAM enhanced HMVEC migration in a dose-dependent manner, and 1000 ng/ml sALCAM showed maximum effect (Fig. 5A). sALCAM also inhibited tube formation of HMVEC on Matrigel (Fig. 5, B and C). These data suggest that native ALCAM also has a primary inhibitory effect on endothelial cell migration but supports in vitro tube formation, and that sALCAM has an ability to modulate endothelial cell function. sALCAM Has a Regulatory Effect on ALCAM Function—To explore whether sALCAM has an ability to bind ALCAM, we prepared COS cells expressing recombinant ALCAM-myc and incubated the cells with sALCAM. Binding was detected by Western blot analysis. No binding of sALCAM was observed at 1 μg/ml concentration. However, at 10 μg/ml concentration significant binding of sALCAM was observed to COS/ALCAM compared with COS/MOCK cells, suggesting that sALCAM has an ability to bind ALCAM (Fig. 6A). Then we examined cell aggregation assays using CHO cells stably expressing ALCAM (CHO/ALCAM). After 30 min of incubation, significant aggregations were observed in CHO/ALCAM, whereas almost no aggregation was observed in mock-transfected control cells (CHO/MOCK) (Fig. 6B). When CHO/ALCAM cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml sALCAM, there were significantly fewer cell aggregates than observed for the CHO/ALCAM cells, whereas 1 μg/ml sALCAM did not affect the formation of the cell aggregions (Fig. 6, B and C). These results suggest that sALCAM has a regulatory effect on ALCAM-ALCAM homophilic interaction. We have described the isolation and characterization of a novel soluble isoform of ALCAM. sALCAM has a single variable type Ig domain that is identical to the amino-terminal Ig domain of ALCAM. Because the amino-terminal Ig domain of ALCAM is the vital adhesive binding site for both ALCAM-ALCAM homophilic and ALCAM-CD6 heterophilic interactions, it was considered likely that sALCAM has a regulatory role in blocking native ALCAM function (7Aruffo A.

Chem. 2001; 276: 25783-25790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Studies reported here indicate that sALCAM modulates endothelial cell function presumably through both ALCAM-dependent and ALCAM-independent pathways and that its expression is differentially regulated upon inflammatory stimulation. ALCAM is a member of the Ig superfamily and has two variable type Ig domains followed by three constant type Ig domains in its extracellular region. The extracellular domains, or ectodomains, of adhesion molecules are important for specific ligand binding and molecular communication with cell surface proteins and extracellular matrix. It has been reported that these ectodomains can be released from the cell largely by proteolytic cleavage to yield soluble cell adhesion molecules (sCAM) (21Meager A. Bird C. Mire-Sluis A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1996; 191: 97-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Although the actual physiological roles of sCAM still remain to be elucidated, their capacity to bind the ligands suggest that they could act either as carrier molecules or as molecular buffers that neutralize excess ligand (21Meager A. Bird C. Mire-Sluis A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1996; 191: 97-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been reported that sCAM play particular roles in angiogenesis, cell migration, and tumor growth (21Meager A. Bird C. Mire-Sluis A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1996; 191: 97-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 22Koch A.E. Halloran M.M. Haskell C.J. Shah M.R. Polverini P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 517-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 23Morbidelli L. Brogelli L. Granger H.J. Ziche M. Life Sci. 1998; 62: PL7-PL11PubMed Google Scholar, 24Gho Y.S. Kleinman H.K.

Although proteolytic cleavage is the most common mechanism for the formation of sCAM, some are produced by alternative splicing such as that seen with PECAM and P-selectin (26Johnston G.I. Bliss G.A. Newman P.J. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21381-21385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Ishiwata, N., Takio, K., Katayama, M., Watanabe, K., Titani, K., Ikeda, Y., and Handa, M.

Chem. 1994; 269: 17183-17191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both soluble PECAM and P-selectin are produced by skipping a single exon encoding a transmembrane domain. Therefore they contain the whole structure of extracellular domain. In contrast, although it is also produced via alternative splicing, sALCAM contains only a part of ectodomain of membrane-bound ALCAM. Furthermore, this is the first report that expression of a sCAM is differentially regulated from that of its membrane-bound counterpart. TNF-α demonstrated moderate and persistent up-regulation of sALCAM expression in HMVEC, although it showed minimal early effect on ALCAM expression. Because TNF-α is a potent proinflammatory cytokine, sALCAM may play an important role in the response of endothelial cells to inflammation. ALCAM is a ligand for CD6 that is involved in T cell activation, and ALCAM expression is induced in T cells following activation (7Aruffo A. Bowen M.A. Patel D.D. Haynes B.F. Starling G.C. Gebe J.A. Bajorath J. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 498-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Moreover, much higher levels of ALCAM have been detected in monocyte lineage cells in synovial fluids of rheumatoid arthritis patient than those in resting monocytes (31Levesque M.C. Heinly C.S. Whichard L.P. Patel D.D. Arthritis Rheum. 1998; 41: 2221-2229Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These findings strongly suggest that ALCAM is involved in the pathophysiology of inflammation. Furthermore, we identified that ALCAM expression was up-regulated in the atherosclerotic aorta from apo-E knock-out mouse (data not shown). Given that inflammation plays crucial roles in atherosclerosis, ALCAM and sALCAM may play particular roles in the development of atherosclerosis (32Schwartz C.J. Valente A.J. Sprague E.A. Kelley J.L. Suenram C.A. Rozek M.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1985; 454: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 33Ross R. N. Engl. J.

On the other hand PMA, a protein kinase C activator, reduced both ALCAM and sALCAM expression in HMVEC. Lately, it has been reported that protein kinase C plays a dominant role in cytoskeleton-dependent ALCAM-mediated adhesion (35Nelissen J.M. Peters I.M. de Grooth B.G. van Kooyk Y. Figdor C.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2057-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 36Zimmerman A.W. Nelissen J.M. Van Emst-De Vries S.E. Willems P.H. De Lange F. Collard J.G. Van Leeuwen F.N. Figdor C.G. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2841-2852Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). PMA strongly reduced cytoskeleton-dependent ALCAM-mediated adhesion in myelomonocytic KG1 cells by reducing protein kinase C expression. However, PMA did not affect ALCAM expression in KG1 cells, indicating that reduction of ALCAM expression in HMVEC is a cell-specific effect of PMA. Because PMA is known to induce hyperpermeability in endothelial cells, reduction of ALCAM-mediated cell adhesion may contribute to PMA-induced hyperpermeability. Further experimental analysis is needed to elucidate the physiological meanings of ALCAM and sALCAM down-regulation by PMA. Because ALCAM is expressed in highly motile cells such as extending neuronal cells, hematopoietic progenitor cells, and metastatic melanoma cells, we speculated that ALCAM might enhance cell motility (9Swart G.W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 81: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). However, Pro5/ALCAM showed less migratory capacity than Pro5/MOCK, indicating that ALCAM has an inhibitory effect on Pro5 migration. Addition of sALCAM increased cell migration of not only Pro5/ALCAM but also Pro5/MOCK, suggesting that sALCAM has an ALCAM-independent effect on cell motility. In the context of these findings, sALCAM enhanced the migration of primary human endothelial cells, HMVEC, in a dose-dependent manner. Notably, sALCAM showed maximum effect on cell migration of Pro5/sALCAM and HMVEC at 1000 ng/ml, whereas 200 ng/ml sALCAM demonstrated the maximum effect for Pro5/MOCK. Given that with 1000 ng/ml sALCAM, Pro5/ALCAM showed similar mobility to Pro5/MOCK and HMVEC highly expressed ALCAM, 1000 ng/ml sALCAM could reverse the ALCAM-dependent inhibitory effect on cell migration. However, 10 μg/ml sALCAM was required to observe the binding to ALCAM and the inhibitory effect on ALCAM-ALCAM homophilic interaction. Thus, we speculate that the ALCAM-dependent inhibitory effect on cell migration is mediated via ALCAM heterophilic interaction with an unknown ligand that could be inhibited by less sALCAM than that needed to inhibit ALCAM-ALCAM homophilic interactions. Further analysis is required to elucidate these issues. Because it has been reported that ALCAM enhances the capillary tube formation of EOMA, a mouse endothelial cell line, we examined tube formation of Pro5/ALCAM on Matrigel (12Ohneda O. Ohneda K. Arai F. Lee J. Miyamoto T. Fukushima Y. Dowbenko D. Lasky L.A. Suda T. Blood. 2001; 98: 2134-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Pro5/ALCAM demonstrated enhanced tube formation as compared with Pro5/MOCK, suggesting that ALCAM has a consistent acceleratory effect on capillary tube formation of endothelial cells regardless of endothelial cell type. sALCAM abrogated this effect of ALCAM on Pro5 tube formation and inhibited tube formation of HMVEC. These data indicate that sALCAM has an inhibitory effect on endothelial cell tube information although it remains unclear whether this effect is achieved by inhibiting ALCAM function, by an ALCAM-independent effect of sALCAM, or through both types of pathways. ALCAM is highly expressed in metastatic human melanoma cell lines (4Degen W.G. van Kempen L.C. Gijzen E.G. van Groningen J.J. van Kooyk Y. Bloemers H.P. Swart G.W. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 805-813PubMed Google Scholar). It is also highly expressed in invasive vertical growth phase human melanoma whereas the majority of benign and thin melanoma do not express ALCAM (29van Kempen L.C. van den Oord J.J. van Muijen G.N. Weidle U.H. Bloemers H.P. Swart G.W. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 769-774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Very recently, it has been reported that expression of recombinant amino-terminally truncated ALCAM (ΔN-ALCAM) diminished cell clustering mediated by wild-type ALCAM (30Van Kempen L.C. Meier F. Egeblad M. Kersten-Niessen M.J. Garbe C. Weidle U.H. Van Muijen G.N. Herlyn M. Bloemers H.P. Swart G.W. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2004; 122: 1293-1301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ΔN-ALCAM promoted cell motility in vitro and increased invading and metastatic potential of melanoma cells. Therefore, ALCAM-mediated adhesion could represent a rate-limiting step in the transition from expansive primary tumor growth to the initial metastatic cascade in melanoma. Although we have not examined sALCAM expression in human melanoma, it is tempting to speculate that sALCAM may induce the initial step of melanoma metastasis by inhibiting ALCAM-mediated cell adhesion. Because the amino-terminal Ig domain of ALCAM is the exact adhesive binding site for ALCAM-ALCAM homophilic adhesion, sALCAM is expected to interfere with the amino-terminal Ig domain of ALCAM (20van Kempen L.C. Nelissen J.M. Degen W.G. Torensma R. Weidle U.H. Bloemers H.P. Figdor C.G. Swart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25783-25790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). sALCAM could partially inhibit the cell aggregation mediated by ALCAM-ALCAM homophilic interaction at 10 μg/ml concentration, whereas 1 μg/ml sALCAM failed to show such activity. Given that 10 μg/ml sALCAM but not 1 μg/ml sALCAM demonstrated significant binding to ALCAM, sALCAM may inhibit ALCAM-ALCAM homophilic interaction via binding to ALCAM competitively. There are several possible explanations for the lack of complete inhibition. First, sALCAM is not able to mask the adhesive capacity of the Ig domain where it binds. Second, the affinity and/or binding capacity of sALCAM to ALCAM is less than that of ALCAM to ALCAM. For cell aggregation mediated by ALCAM homophilic adhesion, clustering of ALCAM through its carboxyl-terminal constant type Ig domains is also essential (20van Kempen L.C. Nelissen J.M. Degen W.G. Torensma R. Weidle U.H. Bloemers H.P. Figdor C.G. Swart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25783-25790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Blocking the clustering of ALCAM using an antibody resulted in failure to form cell aggregation although this antibody did not affect the binding capacity of amino-terminal Ig domain. Therefore, it is also possible that sALCAM inhibits ALCAM-ALCAM homophilic interactions through interfering with the function of carboxyl-terminal Ig domains. Further analysis is required to address this issue, including determining which Ig domain function of ALCAM is blocked by sALCAM. In conclusion, we have isolated a novel soluble isoform of ALCAM. Its ALCAM-dependent and ALCAM-independent effects and differentially regulated transcription suggest that sALCAM is a physiological regulator of endothelial cell function and that sALCAM expands the utility of ALCAM in cell-cell and/or cell-extracellular matrix adhesion and communication. We used recombinant sALCAM protein to obtain data presented here. Therefore, detailed analysis of sALCAM including proving its endogenous translation will provide valuable information for a better understanding of ALCAM function.

https://openalex.org/W1968924661,"STAT5a and STAT5b are two highly related transcription factors that control essential cellular functions. Several STAT5 targets are known, although it is likely that most remain uncharacterized. To identify a more complete set of STAT5-regulated genes, we used a modification of the chromatin immunoprecipitation procedure, which does not presuppose any information regarding these targets. Employing Ba/f3 cells in which STAT5 is activated by interleukin-3, we have identified novel STAT5 binding sites that may be regulatory regions for nearby genes. These sites are typically found far from transcription start sites, and most do not contain CpG islands, indicating that they are not in traditional promoter regions. Nonetheless, when the expression of genes near these STAT5 binding sites was examined, all were expressed in Ba/f3 cells, and most were modulated by interleukin-3. Furthermore, genes identified by this strategy show unique expression patterns in acute leukemias, tumors characterized by activated STAT5. Whereas both STAT5 isoforms bound to all promoters tested, STAT5a and STAT5b bound with different kinetics, suggesting that at least some of the differences between the functions of these two proteins are mediated by their DNA binding activity. Therefore, this method of transcription factor target identification represents an effective strategy to isolate transcription factor targets in an unbiased fashion, and it has revealed many novel STAT5-dependent regulatory regions outside of traditional promoters.

Upon cytokine or growth factor stimulation, STATs become phosphorylated and translocate to the nucleus, where they bind to promoters of their target genes (3Aaronson D.S. Horvath C.M.

In addition to essential functions in normal cells, STATs have been implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous solid and hematopoietic malignancies (4Battle T.E. Frank D.A.

For example, there may be differences in the DNA binding affinities of STAT5a and STAT5b (7Boucheron C. Dumon S. Santos S.C. Moriggl R. Hennighausen L. Gisselbrecht S. Gouilleux F. J. Biol.

Mice lacking STAT5a or STAT5b show phenotypic differences in both mammary development (10Liu X. Robinson G.W. Wagner K-U. Garrett L. Wynshaw-Boris A. Hennighausen L.

These studies indicate that there are differences between STAT5a and STAT5b that may result from either their expression patterns or differential target selection. Clarifying this point is an essential step in understanding the biology of STAT5. Whereas there are genes known to be directly regulated by STAT5 (15Silva M. Benito A. Sanz C. Prosper F. Ekhterae D.

Kanakura Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1367-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), most STAT5 targets are unknown. The location of STAT5-dependent promoters has been shown to be close to the transcription start site, such as the STAT5 binding sites in the CIS and cyclin D1 genes (18Rascle A. Lees E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 6882-6890Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 19Brockman J.L. Schroeder M.D. Schuler L.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 774-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). However, the STAT5 binding site in the bcl-x promoter is found in the first intron (15Silva M. Benito A. Sanz C. Prosper F.

Duan L. Inohara N. Ohta S. Seldin M.F. Nunez G. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4750-4757PubMed Google Scholar), and thus, it is likely that the STAT5 binding sites for other genes may be located in introns as well. To identify STAT5 target genes in an unbiased fashion, we utilized the technique of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), which is a method to identify DNA regions that are bound by a transcription factor in vivo. We combined ligation-mediated PCR with subtraction steps to isolate pure STAT5 targets. We present data showing that this strategy is efficient at identifying STAT5 targets in an unbiased fashion, and we show that the STAT5 binding sites are often in introns. We also show that STAT5a and STAT5b bind to all targets tested, although each isoform binds to any given promoter with different kinetics compared with the other isoform. This demonstrates that STAT5a and STAT5b have distinct differences in their promoter binding behaviors that may underlie their functional differences. Cell Lines—Ba/f3 cells were obtained from the DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (Braunschweig, Germany), and were maintained in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 10% WEHI-3B conditioned media. WEHI-3B cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Antibodies and Cytokines—Antibodies recognizing STAT5a (sc-1081) and total STAT5 (sc-835) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-STAT5b (71-2500 and 13-5300) was obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). Phosphospecific anti-STAT5 (935-1L) was obtained from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Recombinant murine IL-3 was obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Normal rabbit IgG was obtained from Caltag (Burlingame, CA). Cell Stimulations—Ba/f3 cells were washed twice and resuspended in RPMI containing 10% fetal calf serum. For Western blotting, immunoprecipitations, and ChIP analysis, cells were starved for at least 4 h. For reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analysis, cells were placed in 1 pg/ml IL-3 overnight, followed by starvation overnight. Cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml IL-3 for 15 min for Western blots and immunoprecipitations and for 30, 90, and 150 min for ChIP. Stimulations for RT-PCR were performed for 2, 6, and 24 h. RT-PCR—RNA was extracted using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RT-PCR was performed using a Superscript One-Step RT-PCR kit from Invitrogen. Reverse transcription was performed at 50 °C for 30 min followed by cycling 35 times of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. Primer sequences are provided in the Supplemental Materials. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—2 × 107 cells were starved of IL-3 for 4 h. Half of the cells were left untreated, and half of the cells were stimulated with IL-3. Immunoprecipitations and Western blotting were performed as described (4Battle T.E. Frank D.A. Blood. 2003; 102: 3016-3024Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—For each condition, 1.5 × 107 cells were used. Cross-linking was performed with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, followed by a quenching of formaldehyde using 0.125 m glycine. Cells were washed with PBS. Nuclei were isolated in 400 μl of cell lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40) containing phosphatase and protease inhibitors (sodium orthovanadate, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin, aprotinin, and leupeptin) and incubating for 10 min on ice. Nuclei were centrifuged at 2500 rpm in a refrigerated microcentrifuge and were lysed in 100 μl of nuclear lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.1, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, phosphatase and protease inhibitors) on ice for 10 min. 1 ml of IP dilution buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.1, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.01% SDS) was added, and the chromatin was sheared by sonication to an average size of 500-1000 base pairs. Debris was removed by centrifugation, the supernatant was split into three aliquots, and 700 μl of IP dilution buffer were added to each aliquot. 2.5 μg of antibody were added, and the tubes were rocked overnight at 4 °C. 10 μg of tRNA and 40 μl of packed protein A/G beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added, and the samples were rocked for several hours at 4 °C. The beads were then washed with IP wash I (20 mm Tris, pH 8.1, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS) three times for 10 min each at 4 °C, followed by one wash with IP wash II (10 mm Tris, pH 8.1, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholic acid) for 10 min at 4 °C. Three washes with cold TE were performed. After eluting twice using 200 μl of elution buffer (100 mm sodium bicarbonate, 1% SDS) for 10 min at room temperature, 16 μlof5 m NaCl were added, and the cross-links were reversed at 65 °C overnight. The DNA was purified using a Qiagen PCR purification kit. 50 μl of each ChIP product was recovered, and 1 μl was used for PCR. PCR was performed using the following conditions: 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, for 35-45 cycles. Primer sequences are provided in the Supplemental Materials. ChIP-based Gene Identification—ChIP was performed as described, except that two sequential immunoprecipitations were performed. Following the final wash after the first IP, the antibody-chromatin complexes were eluted from the beads three times, using 33 μl of elution buffer each time. 1 ml of IP dilution buffer was added, and the second IP was done as described under “Chromatin Immunoprecipitation.” ChIP cloning was adapted from the method used to isolate differentially expressed genes (21Wang Z. Brown D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11505-11509Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Blunt ends were generated in half of the purified ChIP product using T4 DNA polymerase according to the manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The DNA was precipitated in ethanol with 0.2 m NaCl and 10 μg of glycogen (Roche Applied Science). Linkers were made by annealing oligonucleotides followed by phosphorylation using T4 polynucleotide kinase according to the manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs). Oligonucleotide sequences are as follows: forward, CTAGCTTCGATCGACGGCACTCGGAC; reverse, GTCCGAGTGCCGTCGATCGA. Linkers were purified by precipitation. Approximately 250 ng of these linkers were ligated to the ChIP product using T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs). 1 μl (out of 20 μl total) of the ChIP product/linker ligation mix was amplified by PCR using the forward oligonucleotide of the linker as the primer. The PCR was performed as either tracer or driver. The driver DNA was biotinylated and was used to drive out these sequences from the tracer pool, leaving purified tracer DNA. Therefore, tracer DNA used 200 μm dNTPs, whereas the driver DNA used 3.3 μl in a 50-μl total PCR of 1.5 mm each dATP, dCTP, and dGTP, 1.0 mm dTTP, and 0.5 mm bio-11-dUTP (Enzo Diagnostics, Farmingdale, NY). Amplified DNA was purified using a Qiagen PCR purification kit. Approximately 25-50 ng of tracer DNA was added to a 20-fold excess of driver DNA. The driver and tracer DNA were added to an equal volume of 2× hybridization buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.2% SDS, and 1.5 m NaCl). This solution was incubated at 95 °C for 10 min and then slowly cooled to 68 °C, after which the solution was kept at 68 °C for 2 h. 1.4 μl of 5 m NaCl, 75 μl of TE, and 75 μl of 2× hybridization buffer were mixed and heated to 68 °C, after which the solution was added to the annealed driver and tracer ChIP product and cooled briefly at room temperature. 15 μl of streptavidin solution (2 μg/μl final concentration dissolved in TE with 0.15 m NaCl) were added and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. After phenol/chloroform extraction, 10 μl of streptavidin solution was added to the supernatant. After a 5-min incubation, three phenol/chloroform extractions were performed, and the DNA was precipitated with 0.2 m NaCl and 10 μg of glycogen. The precipitated DNA was resuspended in 20 μl of distilled H2O. Two additional subtractions were performed, and the subtracted DNA was ligated using the TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen). Sequencing—Miniprep DNA was isolated using a Qiagen DNA Miniprep kit. Sequencing was performed at either the Dana Farber Cancer Institute Core Facility or by Seqwright Corp. (Houston, TX). Sequences for these clones are provided in the Supplemental Materials. Data Analysis—Sequenced fragments were analyzed using the University of California, Santa Cruz, Genome Bioinformatics site on the World Wide Web (www.genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBlat). CpG islands were identified using the CpG Island Searcher (available on the World Wide Web at ccnt.hsc.usc.edu/cpgislands/), setting the cut-off parameters to the lowest threshold. Target Validation—Clone-specific primers were made and were tested using at least three separate ChIP products. Primer sequences for ChIP assays are provided in the Supplemental Materials. Expression Data Analysis—Expression data for the global cancer map (22Ramaswamy S. Tamayo P. Rifkin R. Mukherjee S. Yeang C.H. Angelo M. Ladd C. Reich M. Latulippe E. Mesirov J.P. Poggio T. Gerald W.

A. 2001; 98: 15149-15154Crossref PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar) were obtained from the Broad Institute site on the World Wide Web (www.broad.mit.edu/cgi-bin/cancer/datasets.cgi). The human homologs of the putative STAT5 targets were identified using the LocusLink and Unigene databases (available on the World Wide Web at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), and Affymetrix probes for these genes were obtained from GeneCruiser (available on the World Wide Web at www.broad.mit.edu/cancer/genecruiser/). Hierarchical clustering was performed with dChip software (23Li C. Wong W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (2713) Google Scholar) using 1 - r (Pearson's correlation coefficient) as the distance metric. STAT5 Activation in Ba/f3 Cells—We chose the IL-3-dependent Ba/f3 cell line as a model system to aid in the identification of STAT5 targets. IL-3 activates STAT5 in these cells, which leads to the increased expression of the prosurvival protein Bcl-xl (24Gesbert F. Griffin J.D. Blood. 2000; 96: 2269-2276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Dumon S. Santos S.C. Debierre-Grockiego F. Gouilleux-Gruart V. Cocault L. Boucheron C. Mollat P. Gisselbrecht S. Gouilleux F. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4191-4199Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We first confirmed that both STAT5a and STAT5b are present in Ba/f3 cells and that both STAT5 isoforms are phosphorylated in response to IL-3. Immunoprecipitations of lysates from Ba/f3 cells were performed using antibodies specific for STAT5a or STAT5b. No phosphorylated STAT5a or STAT5b was seen in starved cells. However, phosphorylation of both STAT5 isoforms was seen in IL-3-stimulated cells (Fig. 1). Therefore, since IL-3 results in the robust activation of both STAT5a and STAT5b in Ba/f3 cells, we reasoned that these cells would make an attractive model system to identify the targets of both STAT5 proteins. Both STAT5a and STAT5b Bind to the bcl-x Promoter—The STAT5 binding site in the bcl-x promoter has been defined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and it conforms to the TTCN3GAA consensus sequence determined for STAT5 (25Dumon S. Santos S.C. Debierre-Grockiego F. Gouilleux-Gruart V. Cocault L. Boucheron C. Mollat P. Gisselbrecht S. Gouilleux F. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4191-4199Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In order to validate our approach to identifying STAT5 targets, we wanted to confirm the in vivo binding of both STAT5 isoforms to the bcl-x promoter. Primers were designed to amplify this region and were used in a ChIP assay. Ba/f3 cells were starved of IL-3 and then left untreated or stimulated with IL-3. After 30 min, chromatin was harvested, and immunoprecipitations were performed using antibodies specific to STAT5a or to STAT5b. In addition, normal rabbit IgG was used as a nonspecific control. Both STAT5a and STAT5b were bound to the bcl-x promoter after IL-3 stimulation (Fig. 2). Often, some basal binding can be detected in starved cells, but this is dramatically increased with IL-3 stimulation. Importantly, the immunoprecipitation is specific for STAT5a and STAT5b, since there was no detection of the bcl-x promoter when a nonspecific antibody was used for immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2). ChIP-based Gene Identification Strategy—Chromatin immunoprecipitation provides information about the DNA binding activity of a transcription factor in vivo (26Kuo M.H. Allis C.D. Methods. 1999; 19: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). ChIP is performed by formaldehyde cross-linking of protein to DNA and immunoprecipitating these complexes with a specific antibody. Since this method can isolate all of the targets that are bound by the transcription factor at the time of cross-linking, we reasoned that these targets could be identified by a ligation-mediated PCR technique. In this approach, the ChIP product is ligated to linkers and amplified using the linker sequence for priming. At this point, the DNA can be isolated and sequenced. To also identify any major differences in the targets of STAT5a and STAT5b, we added a subtraction step, which is based on the technique to identify differential expression of mRNA species in different tissues (21Wang Z. Brown D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11505-11509Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). There are two advantages to this approach. First, any major differences in targets between STAT5a and STAT5b will be identified, and second, any DNA still bound nonspecifically after the immunoprecipitations will be removed during the subtraction, resulting in a high proportion of STAT5-specific targets. ChIP-based Identification of STAT5 Targets—To identify STAT5 targets, we performed the subtractive ChIP cloning strategy using product from STAT5a and STAT5b chromatin immunoprecipitations. From the resulting clones, we sequenced 32 potential targets isolated from the STAT5a-enriched pool (designated A1-A32) and 39 potential targets isolated from the STAT5b-enriched pool (designated B1-B39). We analyzed the location of these sequences in the genome using the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics browser. Of the 32 STAT5a targets, three gave no matches, and 11 identified unique targets. The others represented multiple clones. 17 of the STAT5b targets were unique targets. We therefore analyzed a total of 28 separate STAT5 binding sites. All of these were unique; none of the STAT5a targets were also isolated from the STAT5b pool, and no targets from one experiment were isolated in another experiment. An analysis of the clones revealed that most are close to genes and thus could be regulatory regions. Of the 28 clones, we analyzed 25 that contained full-length sequence and found that 80% contained a STAT consensus sequence, as defined by TTN5AA, whereas 20% contained no consensus sequence. Since CpG islands are present in ∼60% of genes at their 5′-end (27Antequera F. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1647-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), others have combined ChIP with microarrays made from CpG enriched DNA to identify E2F targets (28Oberley M.J. Farnham P.J. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 371: 577-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 29Weinmann A.S. Bartley S.M. Zhang T. Zhang M.Q. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6820-6832Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 30Wells J. Yan P.S. Cechvala M. Huang T. Farnham P.J. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1445-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Therefore, we wanted to determine whether or not the STAT5 binding sites that we have identified contained CpG islands. We determined that 36% contained CpG islands, whereas 64% did not. Furthermore, those with CpG islands were most often found near the 5′-end of a gene, as expected (27Antequera F. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1647-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Therefore, the STAT5 binding sites that we have identified are most often found near genes, most contain a STAT consensus site, and most do not contain CpG islands. Genes Located near STAT5 Binding Sites—Since STAT5 functions to directly regulate the expression of its target genes, a key question is to identify where these newly identified STAT5 binding sites lie in relation to known genes. Only 17% of these binding sites were within 1 kb of the transcription start site. Interestingly, the majority (54%) of the STAT5 binding sites were within introns. Excluding ESTs, in which the structure of the full-length mRNAs is not well defined, 23% of STAT5 binding sites were located in the first intron (Fig. 3). Genes located near the STAT5 binding sites are listed in Table I. Two binding sites gave no matches using the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics browser, one contained repetitive DNA, and the other 25 binding sites were near genes. These included 19 known and 12 unknown genes. Most of the STAT5 binding sites were near a single gene, but six were near more than one gene. For example, A34 was found in the first intron of 14-3-3γ, and this entire gene was found in the first intron of the ZP3 gene. An important observation is that none of the genes identified represent known STAT5 targets, and they encode genes of various functions, including cytoplasmic signal transduction, DNA binding, calcium homeostasis, vesicle cycling, cell adhesion, and housekeeping functions.Table ILocation of STAT5 binding sites in relation to known genesSTAT5 binding siteNearest geneAccession numberBinding site locationA2Rab19AK0175905′, first exon, first intronA6SecretagoginBC016093∼10 kb 3′A7No matchesA12mKIAA1450AK122512Fifth intronA20ESTCA786702First intronA21Unknown cloneBC026716∼15 kb 5′A22RepetitiveA23ssaAK046469First intronA25Unknown clone; ESTAK047164; BU7086533′ of clone; last intron of ESTA29Early transposon ETnAB033517∼30 kb 3′A3414-3-3γ; ZP3 geneM26410; BC008129First intron of bothB42Unknown cloneAK030034Last intronB430–44 protein homologueAK0118895′ and first exonB46Hypothetical PDZ domain proteinBC028439Last intronB47ArntAK040475First exon, first intronB49KsrU43585First intronB50No matchesB51Hypothetical Src homology 3 domain proteinAK029202∼5 kb 5′B52Hexosaminidase A; ESTAK075911; BY055800Immediately 3′; first intronB55S19; Oct2bAK013524; X53654Second intron; third intronB56CCL3/MIP1αAF065939∼10 kb 3′B57B7-H3AY190318Spans third and fourth intronsB60Srp9; B2 transcribed repetitive sequenceBC039648; M31444∼15 kb 5′; ∼10 kb from transcriptB63ESTBY122638First intronB65Unknown cloneAK052120∼8 kb 5′B68Nurr2AB014889∼500 bp 5′B72SialyltransferaseX86000Immediately 5′B78Tubby-like protein 2; nucleobindinAK054304; AK045087First intron; 5′, first exon, first intron Open table in a new tab Confirmation of STAT5 Binding—In order to confirm that the binding sites that we have identified were true STAT5 targets, we designed primers encompassing these binding sites and performed PCR from multiple ChIP products obtained using STAT5a and STAT5b antibodies. We analyzed 12 targets and found that nine are bound by STAT5 (Fig. 4). Often there was some binding of STAT5 to these targets under starvation conditions, but binding generally increased with IL-3 stimulation, as was the case with B60 (Fig. 4). Interestingly, A34 showed a strong signal in starved cells that was not greatly increased with IL-3 stimulation. This binding is specific for STAT5, since there is no binding to A34 when a nonspecific IgG is used in the immunoprecipitation (Fig. 4). A20 and A25 showed robust binding to STAT5, although there was variability in the binding of STAT5 to these promoters in response to IL-3 (data not shown). Therefore, they are likely STAT5 binding sites, but the variability in the data does not allow us to conclusively determine the extent to which IL-3 regulates both promoters. Importantly, none of the targets were isolated by a nonspecific IgG antibody, indicating that the binding is specific for STAT5 (Fig. 4). Only one of the potential binding sites showed little to no binding (A12), and thus we conclude that this is probably not a STAT5 target (data not shown). Therefore, we conclusively show that nine of the 12 DNA sequences isolated represent true STAT5 binding sites, with eight being regulated by IL-3, and that all nine are bound by both STAT5a and STAT5b. STAT5a and STAT5b Bind to Promoters with Distinct Kinetics—Both STAT5a and STAT5b bound all of the targets tested, but the magnitude of binding of each isoform was different between promoters (Fig. 4). Therefore, we sought to ascertain whether or not binding of STAT5a or STAT5b changed over time. We tested the binding of STAT5 proteins to three promoters after 30, 90, and 150 min of IL-3 stimulation. The binding of STAT5a was similar at each time point on the B60 promoter (Fig. 5), whereas STAT5b shows greatest binding at 90 min. The binding of STAT5a to the B47 promoter increases at 30 and 90 min, whereas STAT5b binding is maximal at 30 min and decreases at later time points. STAT5a binding to the bcl-x promoter increases continually through 150 min, whereas STAT5b is bound maximally at 90 min. The kinetics of phosphorylation of both STAT isoforms is similar through 150 min (data not shown), suggesting that any differences of DNA binding are not due to differences in phosphorylation. Thus, STAT5a and STAT5b behave differently on various promoters when both are activated in the same cell. STAT5 Targets Are Modulated by IL-3 in Ba/f3 Cells—To determine whether the association of STAT5 with a particular binding site has functional consequences, we determined whether any of the genes containing these binding sites were regulated by IL-3 in Ba/f3 cells. We tested five of the newly identified STAT5 target genes for expression. As a control, we examined the known STAT5 target bcl-x and found that i"

We described previously the inhibitory effect of PGE2 on the expression and release of the inflammatory chemokines CCL3 and CCL4 from activated dendritic cells. In this study we describe a novel PGE2 signaling pathway that proceeds through EP-2 → cAMP → EPAC → phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase → protein kinase B → GSK-3 and results in increased DNA binding of the CCAAT displacement protein (CDP), a potent mammalian transcriptional repressor.

Following stimulation through the Toll-like receptors (TLR), DCs express and release proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, up-regulate the expression of costimulatory molecules, and migrate to the nearest lymph node where they induce the activation and proliferation of naive T cells (reviewed in Refs. 1Kaisho T.

For mature TLR-activated DC, PGE2 acts primarily as an anti-inflammatory agent, inhibiting the production of IL-12p70, tumor necrosis factor, and IL-6 (14Kalinski P. Vieira P.L.

Biol. 1997; 417: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In agreement with the general anti-inflammatory effect, we reported previously that PGE2 inhibits the expression and release of CCL3 and CCL4, two potent pro-inflammatory chemokines, from LPS- and PGN-stimulated DCs (20Jing H. Vassiliou E. Ganea D. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2003; 74: 868-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effect of PGE2 on CCL3/4 production is mediated through the EP-2 and possibly EP-4 receptors (20Jing H. Vassiliou E. Ganea D. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2003; 74: 868-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In this report we identified the signaling pathway initiated by PGE2 and leading to the suppression of CCL3/4 expression. We demonstrate that PGE2 signals through the EPAC → PKB → GSK-3 mediators resulting in increased DNA binding of the CDP repressor and that siRNA knock-down of CDP reverses the inhibitory effect of PGE2 on CCL3/4 expression. Mice—Male B10.A mice 6–8 weeks old were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, MA) and were maintained in the Rutgers State University (Newark, NJ) animal facility under pathogen-free conditions. Reagents—LPS (Escherichia coli O26:56), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), avidin peroxidase, and FITC-conjugated F(ab)′2 goat anti-rabbit IgG, LiCl, and SB 216763 were purchased from Sigma. TMB ELISA substrate was purchased from Pierce. Capture and biotinylated anti-mouse CCL4 antibody were purchased from Pharmingen. Recombinant murine CCL4 was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Purified and biotinylated anti-mouse CCL3 antibodies and recombinant mouse CCL3 were purchased from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ). The cAMP Biotrak EIA System was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. PD98059, H89, dibutyryl cAMP (Bt2cAMP), the EPAC-specific activator 8-CPT-2′-OMe-cAMP, and the GSK-3 inhibitor II were obtained from Calbiochem. Antibodies to total and phospho-PKB, ERK1/2, p38, JNK, and CREB were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The EP-2 agonist butaprost, the EP-1/EP-3 agonist sulprostone, and the EP-3/EP-2 agonist misoprostol were purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Generation and Purification of DC from Bone Marrow—DCs were generated from B10.A bone marrow as described previously (20Jing H. Vassiliou E. Ganea D. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2003; 74: 868-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). At day 7, CD11c+ DCs were harvested and purified from the nonadherent cells by immunomagnetic sorting using anti-CD11c-coated magnetic beads and the autoMACS system (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergish-Gladbach, Germany). The purity of the sorted cells was determined by FACS analysis (>96% CD11c+). Culture of the DC2.4 Cell Line—The DC2.4 cell line was derived from C57BL/6 bone marrow cells and was generously provided by Dr. Kenneth L. Rock (University of Massachusetts Medical Center, Worcester, MA). The cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1% minimum Eagle's medium nonessential amino acids. CCL3 and CCL4 Measurement by ELISA—Purified DCs (or DC2.4) were cultured in 24-well culture plates at 1 × 105 cells per well in a final volume of 1 ml and stimulated with LPS (1 μg/ml) in the presence or absence of PGE2 (1 μm). Cell-free supernatants were harvested and subjected to CCL3/4 ELISAs. In some experiments, inhibitors of MAPKs or PKA were added to cultures 1 h before LPS and PGE2. For the detection of CCL3, we used 0.5 μg/ml purified polyclonal antibody as capture Ab, followed by detection with biotinylated anti-mouse CCL3 Ab (0.2 μg/ml). CCL4 was assayed with AG5–2 as capture Ab (4 μg/ml) followed by detection with the biotinylated anti-mouse CCL4 Ab (2 μg/ml). The sensitivity of ELISAs for CCL3 and CCL4 was 20 pg/ml. Real Time PCR—The SYBR green-based real time PCR technique was used to detect the expression of chemokines, prostanoid receptors (EPs), and the CDP gene. Total RNA was prepared from BM-DCs or DC2.4 cells, and 1 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA in the presence of 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus-RT, 40 units of RNasin, 1 μg of random primers, 0.5 mm dNTPs, 3 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 1 × Moloney murine leukemia virus reaction buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) in a total volume of 30 μl at 42 °C for 1 h. cDNA was diluted 10 times for real time PCR. The PCR mixture consists of 2 μl diluted cDNA, 5 μl of SYBR green-containing PCR master mixture (2 ×), and 150 μm of each primer in a total volume of 10 μl. The specific primers for real time PCR were designed by using the Primer Express™ software from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) and were as follows: CCL3 sense 5′-ACTGCCTGCTGCTTCTCCTACA-3′ and antisense 5′-AGGAAAATGACACCTGGCTGG-3′; CCL4 sense 5′-AAACCTAACCCCGAGCAACA-3′ and antisense 5′-CCATTGGTGCTGAGAACCCT-3′; EP1 sense 5′-TTAACCTGAGCCTAGGGGATG-3′ and antisense 5′-CGCTGGTGATGTGCCATTATC-3′; EP2 sense 5′-TGCAAGAGTCGTCAGTGGCT-3′ and antisense 5′-AACAGTGCCAGTGCGATGAG-3′; EP3 sense 5′-CAATCAGATGTCGGTTGAGCA-3′ and antisense 5′-AGATCTGGTTCAGCGAAGCC-3′; EP4 sense 5′-TTTCTTCGGTCTGTCGGGTC-3′ and antisense 5′-CGCTTGTCCACGTAGTGGCT-3′; CDP sense 5′-GGACGTAATGTCCGAAGATGC-3′ and antisense 5′-CTCAGAGGGCGAGGAAATTG-3′; and GAPDH sense 5′-GGAGCGAGACCCCACTAACA-3′ and antisense 5′-ACATACTCAGCACCGGCCTC-3′. Real time PCR was performed using the ABI PRISM 7900HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems), and the cycling conditions used were 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min for 40 cycles, followed by a melting point determination that results in a single peak if the amplification is specific. The expression level for each gene was shown by the cycle numbers needed for the cDNA to be amplified to reach a threshold. The cycle numbers were also converted into arbitrary amounts of DNA using a standard curve generated for each pair of primers, and the results are normalized to the housekeeping gene GAPDH mRNA in the same sample. Nuclear Extracts and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)— Purified CD11c+ DCs as well as DC2.4 cells were cultured at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml and stimulated with LPS (1 μg/ml) in the presence or absence of PGE2 (1 μm) for 1 h. Nuclear extracts were prepared using the NucBuster protein extraction kit (Novagen, Inc., Madison, WI) as recommended by the manufacturer. Briefly, cell pellets were resuspended in 150 μl of NucBuster extraction reagent 1 for 5 min on ice to release nuclei. The nuclei were harvested by centrifugation (16,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C) and washed with ice-cold 1 × PBS to remove cytoplasmic proteins. The nuclei were resuspended in 50 μl of NucBuster extraction reagent 2 for 5 min on ice, and nuclear extracts were separated from cell debris by centrifugation (16,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C). The protein concentration in nuclear extracts was measured using the protein assay (Bio-Rad). Double-stranded oligonucleotides binding to target transcriptional factors were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega). The sequences for the probes used in these experiments were as follows: AP1 5′-CTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-3′; NF-κB 5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′; CREB 5′-AGAGATTGCCTGACGTCAGAGAGCTAG-3′; CDP 5′-ACCCAATGATTATTAGCCAATTTCTGA-3′. The radiolabeled probes (10,000 cpm) were incubated with 10 μg of nuclear extracts for 20 min at room temperature in a 10-μl total volume of binding solution containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC). For CDP supershift assays, 10 μg of nuclear extracts were incubated with 1 μl of specific CDP Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 20 min at room temperature, followed by incubation with 1 μl of labeled CDP probe for an additional 20 min. The mixtures were separated on 4% native PAGE in 0.5× TBE, and the gels were dried and quantified by using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins/DNA Assays—Protein/DNA assays were used to screen simultaneously a large number of transcription factors for DNA binding activity. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described above. The protein/DNA assays were carried out with the TranSignal™ Protein/DNA Array I (Panomics, Redwood City, CA). In brief, 15 μg of total nuclear proteins were incubated with biotin-labeled DNA-binding probes (TranSignal Probe Mix) to allow the formation of protein-DNA (or TF-DNA) complexes. The protein-DNA complexes were separated from free probes by electrophoresis in agarose gels. The probes present in the complexes were eluted and hybridized to the TranSignal membrane dotted with corresponding nonlabeled probes, and the signals were detected by chemiluminescence. siRNA Transfection—The 21-nucleotide small interfering RNA duplexes with two overhang dT nucleotides at 3′-ends were designed according to the method of Elbashir et al. (21Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Webeer K. Tuschi T. Methods. 2002; 26: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar) and synthesized by Dharmacon Inc. (Lafayette, CO). The sequence of the sense strand of CDP siRNA is AAGAGACUAAUUGAUGUUCCA. The control siRNA was an irrevelant siRNA with random nucleotides and a similar GC ratio to CDP siRNA (Dharmacon). Transfections were conducted by using the GeneSilencer siRNA Transfection reagent as recommended by the manufacturer (Gene Therapy System, San Diego). Briefly, DC2.4 cells (2 × 105 cells) were plated in 6-well plates overnight and changed into 1 ml of serum-free RPMI 1640 medium before transfection. Five μl of 40 μm CDP siRNA or control siRNA duplexes were incubated with 5 μl of siRNA transfection reagent for 5 min at room temperature, and these mixtures were added to the serum-free DC2.4 cells. Mock controls were transfected with 5 μl of siRNA transfection reagent alone. Four hours later, 1 ml of RPMI 1640 containing 20% FBS was added to each well. RNA was prepared from DCs 24–72 h after transfection and subjected to real time PCR for CDP expression. In some experiments, DC2.4 cells were transfected with siRNA for 72 h and then treated with LPS and LPS plus PGE2 followed by analysis of chemokine expression. Western Blots—Purified CD11c+ DCs were cultured at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml, stimulated with LPS (1 μg/ml) in the presence or absence of PGE2 (1 μm), and harvested at the designed time points. Total cell lysates were prepared by using cell lysis buffer (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), and equal amounts of total protein were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE. After transfer to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad), the membranes were probed with specific primary antibodies, followed by incubation with appropriate secondary Abs conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Peroxidase activity was detected by using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce) as recommended by the manufacturer. Measurement of Intracellular cAMP—Intracellular cAMP production following PGE2 challenge was measured by using the cAMP Biotrak EIA System as recommended by manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). Purified DC or DC2.4 cells (1 × 105 cells/200 μl) were cultured in the presence of the cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Sigma). Cells were treated with or without PGE2 (1 μm) or LPS (1 μg/ml) for the designed time points (as indicated in text). The reaction was stopped by brief centrifugation, followed by addition of 200 μl of lysis buffer. 100 μl of cell lysates were used to determine the intracellular cAMP contents by an enzyme immunoassay method. The amount of cAMP was determined by comparison with standard curves obtained with predetermined concentrations of cAMP. The assay system has a sensitivity of 12.5 fmol of cAMP/100 μl. PKB Assay by FACS—To determine the amount of total and phosphorylated intracellular PKB, we used intracellular flow cytometry. Briefly, the cells were fixed and permeabilized using Cytofix/Cytoperm kit (Pharmingen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were stained with rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-PKB (Cell Signaling Technology) or mouse monoclonal anti-PKB (Cell Signaling Technology) antibodies for 45 min, followed by the appropriate FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies for 30 min. Control rabbit and mouse IgG were used to confirm specificity. After extensive washing, cells were analyzed by FACS analysis. GSK-3 Kinase Assay—Purified BM-DCs were treated with 1 μm PGE2 or with different GSK-3 inhibitors (10 mm LiCl, 20 μm SB216763, or 20 μm GSK-3 Inhibitor II) for 1 h followed by total cell lysate preparation. Untreated cells were used as control. The GSK-3 kinase activity was assayed by using a kit from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY), as recommended by the manufacturer. In brief, 10 μg of total protein was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with 1 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi/μl) and 62.5 μm GSM (GSK-3 substrate peptide) in a 40-μl total volume containing 2 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), 0.05 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 15 mm MgCl2, and 100 μm unlabeled ATP. 25 μl of the reaction mixture was spotted onto P81 phosphocellulose paper followed by extensive washing with 0.75% phosphoric acid. Then the assay papers were transferred into scintillation mixture, and we measured the radioactivity of each sample in a scintillation counter. Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Analysis of data was performed using the Student's t test with p < 0.05 as the minimum significant level. PGE2 Inhibits LPS-induced CCL3/4 Expression in BM-DCs and DC2.4 Cells—Purified CD11c+ DCs (BM-DC) and DC2.4 cells were stimulated with LPS in the presence or absence of exogenous PGE2. LPS induces high levels of CCL3 and CCL4, and PGE2 inhibits LPS-induced chemokine release in both BM-DCs and DC2.4 cells (Fig. 1A). The PGE2 inhibitory effect on CCL3/4 release is paralleled by a decrease in CCL3/4 transcription (Fig. 1B). Screening for Transcription Factors Affected by PGE2—Because PGE2 inhibits CCL3/4 expression at the mRNA level, we investigated the transcription factors (TF) involved in this event. We used first a DNA/protein array to screen for TFs that might be positively or negatively regulated by PGE2. The DNA/protein arrays were performed with nuclear extracts from BM-DCs stimulated with LPS or LPS plus PGE2. Although LPS induces strong DNA binding activity for AP1, AP2, CREB, NF-κB, GATA, Egr, Smad 3/4, and USF-1, PGE2 does not affect these TFs (Table I). PGE2 decreased the DNA binding activity of NFAT, Sp1, SRE, TFIID, and Pbx1 and increased the DNA binding activity of CDP/CBF, Est-1/PEA3, and P53 (Table I).Table IEffects of PGE2 on the DNA binding activity of various TFsEffect on DNA binding activityTFs↓NF-AT, Sp1, SRE, TFIID, Pbx1↑NF-AT, Sp1, SRE, TFIID, Pbx1↔CREB, NF-KB, AP1, AP2, GATA, EGR, smad3/4, USF-1 Open table in a new tab Previous reports indicated that AP1, NF-κB, and CREB/ATF are crucial for CCL3/4 transcription. In agreement with our DNA/protein array data, PGE2 does not affect the DNA binding activity of AP1, NF-κB, and CREB/ATF, as determined by EMSA (Fig. 2, A–C). PGE2 Induces CDP Binding—Since with the exception of members of the CCAAT displacement protein family (CDP), none of the factors whose binding is affected by PGE2 have been reported to be involved in CCL3/4 expression, we focused on CDP. The DNA/protein array indicated that PGE2 increases the DNA binding of CDP, a CCAAT displacement protein previously reported to act as a transcriptional repressor. EMSA experiments with nuclear extracts from both BM-DCs and DC2.4 cells show a significant increase in CDP binding in cells treated with PGE2, both in the presence and absence of LPS (Fig. 2D). PGE2 concentrations from 10–6 to 10–8m increased CDP binding to a similar degree, and even PGE2 10–9m induced CDP binding above control levels (Fig. 2E). The CDP binding is specific, as shown by successful competition with a cold specific probe and by supershift with a specific anti-CDP antibody (Fig. 2F). Knock-down of CDP Reverses the Inhibitory Effect of PGE2 on CCL3/4 Production—To address the question whether CDP acts as a CCL3/4 repressor, we knocked down CDP expression with siRNA. DC2.4 cells were transfected with CDP siRNA, an siRNA control, or transfection reagent alone (Mock). RNA was prepared 48 h later, and the expression levels of CDP were determined by real time RT-PCR. Compared with untreated cells, the cells transfected with mock or siRNA control express comparable levels of CDP, whereas cells transfected with CDP siRNA exhibit significantly lower levels of CDP (Fig. 3A). The CDP levels were low even 72 h after transfection (data not shown). Next, DC2.4 cells were transfected with CDP siRNA or control for 72 h, followed by treatment with LPS in the presence or absence of PGE2. The expression of CCL3/4 was determined 3 h later by real time RT-PCR. In nontransfected or mock-transfected cells, PGE2 inhibits LPS-induced CCL3/4 expression. This inhibition is partially reversed in cells transfected with CDP siRNA (Fig. 3B). The reversal was also observed at protein level in cells transfected with CDP siRNA (Fig. 3C). Taken together, these results indicate that CDP mediates at least partially the inhibitory effect of PGE2 on LPS-induced CCL3/4 expression. cAMP Mediates the Inhibitory Effect of PGE2—Previously, we showed that the inhibitory effect of PGE2 on CCL3/4 production in BM-DCs is mediated through EP-2 and possibly EP-4 receptors. Real time RT-PCR experiments indicate similar patterns for EP-2 and EP-4 expression in BM-DCs and DC2.4 cells (Fig. 4A). To assess the contribution of the EP receptors to the increase in CDP binding observed with PGE2, we used three EP receptor agonists, i.e. butaprost, an EP-2-specific agonist, misoprostol, a preferential EP-3/EP-2 agonist that also binds EP-4 at high concentrations, and sulprostone, an EP-1/EP-3 agonist. Because butaprost has a 10-fold lower affinity for EP-2 than PGE2, we used butaprost concentrations corresponding from 10–6 to 10–8m PGE2. The two higher concentrations of butaprost induced CDP binding, which indicates the involvement of the EP-2 receptor (Fig. 4B, lower panel). Misoprostol induced strong CDP binding at high concentrations, where it acts as an EP-3/EP-2 receptor (Fig. 4B, upper panel). The possible involvement of the EP-3 receptor in the induction of CDP binding was eliminated by the fact that sulprostone, an EP-1/EP-3 agonist, did not induce CDP binding, even at 10–6m (Fig. 4B, lower panel). These results indicate that the effects of PGE2 on CDP binding are mediated through the EP-2 receptor. Because EP-2 receptors are coupled to Gα resulting in the activation of adenylate cyclase, we investigated whether PGE2 induces cAMP in BM-DCs and DC2.4 cells. PGE2 induced a rapid increase in cAMP as early as 5 min following stimulation, reaching a maximum around 10 min, followed by a gradual decrease (results not shown). The effect on cAMP levels is dose-dependent, with significant increases for 10–6–10–7m PGE2 (Fig. 4C). PGE2 induced comparable amounts of cAMP in the presence and absence of LPS (Fig. 4C). The involvement of cAMP as a mediator in the inhibition of CCL3/4 by PGE2 is supported by the inhibitory effect of Bt2cAMP, a stable cAMP analog (Fig. 4D). The CCL3/4 Inhibition by PGE2 Is Not Mediated by the PKA/CREB Pathway—Because the classical downstream cAMP target is PKA, we pretreated BM-DCs and DC2.4 cells with the PKA inhibitor H89 (10–6–10–9m), followed by LPS and PGE2. No reversal of the PGE2-induced inhibition was observed (Fig. 5A), suggesting that PKA does not participate in the PGE2 signaling pathway. To further eliminate the possible involvement of PKA, we examined the phosphorylation of CREB (pCREB) by Western blotting. LPS induced strong CREB phosphorylation, whereas PGE2 did not induce pCREB and did not affect LPS-induced CREB phosphorylation (Fig. 5B). These results are consistent with the fact that PGE2 does not affect CREB DNA binding in the EMSA experiments (Fig. 2A). PGE2 Does Not Affect the TLR Common Core Response—LPS induces proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in DCs through the TLR common core response, mediated through the activation of MAPKs and NF-κB. PGE2 did not affect LPS-induced NF-κB binding as determined by both DNA/protein arrays and EMSA (Table I and Fig. 2C). To assess the involvement of the ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK pathways in the LPS-induced CCL3/4 expression, we treated BM-DCs and DC2.4 cells with LPS in the presence and absence of MAPK inhibitors. PD98059, an ERK1/2 specific inhibitor, reduced CCL3/4 production in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6A, and data not shown), whereas the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB 203580 did not affect chemokine production (data not shown). To determine whether the inhibitory effect of PGE2 is mediated through the inhibition of ERK1/2, we treated BM-DCs with LPS in the presence or absence of PGE2, followed by Western blotting for phosphorylated ERK1/2. In contrast to PD98059, PGE2 did not affect LPS-induced ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 6B). The effect of PGE2 on the phosphorylation of JNK and p38 was also analyzed by Western blots. Similar to ERK1/2, PGE2 did not affect the LPS-induced phosphorylation of JNK or p38 (Fig. 6C). Activation of EPAC Mediates the Inhibitory Effect of PGE2 on CCL3/4—Our previous results showed that the inhibition of chemokines by PGE2 was mediated in a cAMP-dependent but PKA-independent manner. Recently, other cAMP-dependent pathways have been reported, including cAMP-gated ion channels and EPAC. To determine whether EPAC is involved in the inhibition of chemokine production, BM-DCs were treated with LPS in the presence or absence of different concentrations of the EPAC-specific activator, 8-CPT-2′-OMe-cAMP. Similar to Bt2cAMP and PGE2, 8-CPT-2′-OMe-cAMP inhibits chemokine production at both the protein and mRNA level (Fig. 7, A and B). Next, we investigated if activation of EPAC by 8-CPT-2′-OMe-cAMP induces CDP binding. BM-DCs were treated with PGE2, Bt2cAMP, or 8-CPT-2′-OMe-cAMP and CDP binding was analyzed by EMSA. PGE2, Bt2cAMP, and 8-CPT-2′-OMe-cAMP induced comparable levels of CDP binding (Fig. 7C). These results suggest that activation of EPAC mediates the inhibitory effect of PGE2. PGE2 Induces PKB Phosphorylation—Next, we investigated the downstream events regulated by EPAC. There is evidence that activation of EPAC by cAMP signals through the PI3K-PKB pathway. Because the PI3K inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 were cytotoxic for DC except at low concentrations that proved to be inefficient in terms of PI3K inhibition, we examined whether PGE2 activates PKB in untreated or LPS-treated BM-DCs. BM-DCs were treated with PGE2 in the presence or absence of LPS. and the levels of phosphorylated PKB were determined by flow cytometry. We did not detect phosphorylated PKB in cells cultured with medium or stimulated with LPS. However, phosphorylated PKB was present in the majority (>94%) of the medium- or LPS-stimulated BM-DCs treated with PGE2 (Fig. 8). Involvement of GSK-3 in Chemokine Production—Because PGE2 activates PKB, which in turn phosphorylates and inactivates GSK-3, we considered the possibility that GSK-3 might be involved in CCL3/4 expression. BM-DCs were treated with LPS in the presence of different concentrations of the GSK-3 inhibitors SB216763 and GSK-3 inhibitor II. Both inhibitors decrease LPS-induced CCL3"
https://openalex.org/W2087482733,"Paracellin-1 (PCLN-1) belongs to the claudin family of tight junction proteins and possibly plays a critical role in the reabsorption of magnesium and calcium. So far, the physiological properties of PCLN-1 have not been clarified. In the present study, we investigated whether PCLN-1 is associated with ZO-1. We also investigated whether 45Ca2+ transport across the paracellular barrier is affected by this association. In vitro binding analysis using glutathione S-transferase fusion protein showed that the C-terminal TRV sequence, especially Thr and Val residues, of PCLN-1 interacts with ZO-1. Next, PCLN-1 was stably expressed in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells using a FLAG tagging vector. ZO-1 was co-immunoprecipitated with the wild-type PCLN-1 and the alanine substitution (TAV) mutant. However, mutants of the deletion (ΔTRV) and the alanine substitution (ARV and TRA) inhibited the association of PCLN-1 with ZO-1. Confocal immunofluorescence demonstrated that the wild-type PCLN-1 and the TAV mutant localized in the tight junction along with ZO-1, but the ΔTRV, ARV, and TRA mutants were widely distributed in the lateral membrane including the tight junction area. Interestingly, monolayers of cells expressing the wild-type PCLN-1 and the TAV mutant showed higher activities of 45Ca2+ transport from apical to basal compartments, compared with those expressing the ΔTRV, ARV, and TRA mutants and the mock cells. 45Ca2+ transport was inhibited by increased magnesium concentration suggesting that magnesium and calcium were competitively transported by PCLN-1. It was noted that a positive electrical potential gradient enhanced 45Ca2+ transport from apical to basal compartments without affecting the opposite direction of transport. Thus, PCLN-1 localizes to the tight junction followed by association with ZO-1, and the PCLN-1·ZO-1 complex may play an essential role in the reabsorption of divalent cations in renal epithelial cells.

Magnesium is an important cofactor for various enzymes. The bodies magnesium balance is regulated by the kidney, which adapts magnesium excretion based on net magnesium absorption from intestine. Renal magnesium filtrated in the glomeruli is predominantly reabsorbed through the paracellular pathway in the thick ascending limb (TAL) 1The abbreviations used are: TAL, thick ascending limb; TJ, tight junction; PCLN-1, paracellin-1; SH, Src homology; GST, glutathione S-transferase; TER, transepithelial electrical resistance; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; FHHNC, familial hypomagnesemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis. 1The abbreviations used are: TAL, thick ascending limb; TJ, tight junction; PCLN-1, paracellin-1; SH, Src homology; GST, glutathione S-transferase; TER, transepithelial electrical resistance; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; FHHNC, familial hypomagnesemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis. of Henle (1Quamme G.A. de Rouffignac C. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: D694-D711Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the molecular nature of magnesium reabsorption in TAL was unknown for many years. Tight junction (TJ) forms apical junctional complexes in epithelial and endothelial cells and plays a central role in the maintenance of barrier and cell polarity (2Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1631-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 3Rodriguez-Boulan E. Nelson W.J. Science. 1989; 245: 718-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). These functions are facilitated by occludin and claudin family. So far, at least 22 mammalian isoforms of claudin have been identified, and their spatial distribution patterns in some epithelial tissues have been clarified. Paracellin-1 (PCLN-1), cloned by Simon et al. (4Simon D.B. Lu Y. Choate K.A. Velazquez H. Al-Sabban E. Praga M. Casari G. Bettinelli A. Colussi G. Rodriguez-Soriano J. McCredie D. Milford D. Sanjad S. Lifton R.P. Science. 1999; 285: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar), is a most cogent protein that undertakes magnesium reabsorption, because (1Quamme G.A. de Rouffignac C. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: D694-D711Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) homozygous mutations in the PCLN-1 gene are associated with a rare familial hypomagnesemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis (FHHNC), and (2Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1631-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) PCLN-1 is exclusively expressed in the TJ of TAL. PCLN-1 belongs to the claudin family (named claudin-16), which composes a TJ strand and is the most distantly related member of this family. Amino acid homology between PCLN-1 and individual claudin is very low (10–18%), but these proteins have a consensus PSD95/DglA/ZO-1-like domain (PDZ)-binding motif at the C terminus (5Lim I.A. Hall D.D. Hell J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21697-21711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Protein-protein interactions mediated by the PDZ-binding motif occur through the PDZ domains in multiple members of the membrane-associated guanylate kinases (6Lue R.A. Marfatia S.M. Branton D. Chishti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9818-9822Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Membrane-associated guanylate kinases contain several PDZ domains, an SH3 domain, and a C-terminal guanylate kinase homology region that may act as a protein-binding domain (7Olsen O. Bredt D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6873-6878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 8Yamamoto Y. Irie K. Asada M. Mino A. Mandai K. Takai Y. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3889-3897Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Among them, ZO-1 and ZO-2 are localized at the TJ area and they may anchor transmembrane proteins, such as occludin and claudin family. Thus, the interactions between transmembrane proteins and cytoplasmic molecules may modulate paracellular permeability. The direct binding of ZO-1 with the C terminus (YV sequence) of claudin-1–8 has been revealed by an in vitro binding assay using glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein and in vivo immunofluorescence analysis (9Itoh M. Furuse M. Morita K. Kubota K. Saitou M. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1351-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). However, the C terminus (TRV sequence) of PCLN-1 is different from that of other proteins in the claudin family, and the function of PCLN-1 has not been clarified yet. In the present study, we found the association between ZO-1 and the C-terminal TRV sequence of PCLN-1. Furthermore, the function of PCLN-1 was established by measurements of transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and 45Ca2+ transport. Materials—Rabbit polyclonal ZO-1 antibody was obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc. Mouse monoclonal FLAG M2 antibody and G418 sulfate were from Sigma. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit IgG was from Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories (Guildford, UK). Goat polyclonal GST antibody, protein G-Sepharose beads, and 45CaCl2 was from Amersham Biosciences. Goat polyclonal occludin antibody and goat polyclonal PCLN-1 antibody were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Lipofectamine 2000 was from Invitrogen. All other reagents were of the highest grade of purity available. Plasmid cDNA Constructs—Rat PCLN-1 cDNA containing the whole open reading frame was amplified by the reverse transcriptase-PCR from rat kidney mRNA using the set of primers, 5′-CGATATCCATGAAGGATCTTCTTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCGGTCGACTTACACTCTCGTGTC-3′ (antisense). The PCLN-1 cDNA was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector, pCMV-Tag2A (BD Biosciences Clontech), containing the FLAG epitope. Additional FLAG-PCLN-1 cDNA encoding PCLN-1 with point substitutions in the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif (substitutions are underlined, FLAG-PCLN-1-ARV, FLAG-PCLN-1-TAV, FLAG-PCLN-1-TRA) and with the deletion mutant (FLAG-PCL-N-1-ΔTRV) were constructed by PCR using the above sense and the antisense primers (ARV, 5′-CCGGTCGACTTACACTCTCGCGTC-3′; TAV, 5′-CCGGTCGACTTACACTGCCGTGTC-3′; TRA, 5′-CCGGTCGACTTACGCTCTCGTGTC-3′; ΔTRV, 5′-CGTCGACTTAGTCTACAGCGTAC-3′). Fusion proteins of the C terminus of PCLN-1 with GST were constructed by subcloning PCR amplified DNA fragments into pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) to yield GST-PCLN-1-ΔTRV, GST-PCLN-1-TRA, GST-PCLN-1-TAV, and GST-PCLN-1-ARV, respectively. All wild-type and mutant PCLN-1 constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. In Vitro Binding Assay—The plasmids of GST-PCLN-1-ΔTRV, GST-PCLN-1-ARV, GST-PCLN-1-TAV, and GST-PCLN-1-TRA were transformed in Escherichia coli BL21. GST fusion proteins were purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences). The beads were incubated with lysate of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells in a buffer composed of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) for 4 h at 4 °C. Then, bound proteins were eluted with a sample buffer and applied to the SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and incubated for 1 h with each primary antibody followed by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The blots were visualized as described in the Western blotting section. Cell Culture and Transfection—MDCK cells were obtained from the European Collection of Cell Cultures (#84121903, Wiltshire, UK). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 5% Fetal Clone III (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT), 0.07 mg/ml penicillin-G potassium, and 0.14 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. MDCK cells were transfected with expression plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 as indicated in the manufacture's protocol. Stable transfectants were selected with 0.5 mg/ml G418 sulfate and maintained in the continuous presence of the selecting drug. Cell lines expressing FLAG-tagged protein were screened by Western blotting. Preparation of Membrane Fraction and Immunoprecipitation— Whole membrane fraction was prepared from MDCK cells on day 7 in culture as described previously (10Ikari A. Nakano M. Kawano K. Suketa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33338-33343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The samples were solubilized in a lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and incubated with protein G-Sepharose beads and an antibody specific for GST at 4 °C for 1 h with gentle rocking. After centrifugation at 6000 × g for 1 min, the pellet was washed four times with the lysis buffer. The pellet was solubilized in the sample buffer for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein concentration was measured using the protein assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blotting— SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out as described previously (11Ikari A. Nakajima K. Kawano K. Suketa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In brief, whole membrane fractions (30 μg) or immunoprecipitants were applied to the SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and incubated for 1 h with each primary antibody followed by a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Finally, the blots were stained with the ECL Western blotting kit from Amersham Biosciences. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—The cells grown on cover glass for 7 days were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.5 mm CaCl2 and 0.5 mm MgCl2 prior to fixation with 3% paraformaldehyde for 7 min at room temperature. After permeabilization with 0.3% Triton X-100 for 15 min and blocking with 5% skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min, the cells were incubated with an anti-ZO-1 antibody and an anti-FLAG antibody (final dilution 1/100) for 60 min at room temperature. They were then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, followed by incubation with Texas Redlabeled anti-goat IgG and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit IgG in a blocking solution (dilution 1/100) for 60 min. Immunolabeled cells were visualized on an LSM 510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany) set with the appropriate filter for Texas Red (543 nm excitation, 585–615 nm emission filter) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (488 nm excitation, 530 nm emission filter). Images were further processed using Adobe Photoshop (Adobe System, Inc). Measurement of TER and Transepithelial Transport Assay—MDCK cells were plated at confluent densities on transwells with polyester membrane inserts (Corning Life Sciences, Acton, MA). TER was measured three times for each well at indicated times using a Millicell-ERS epithelial volt-ohmmeter (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and averaged values were collected. TER values (ohm × cm2) were normalized by the area of the monolayer and calculated by subtracting the blank values from the filter and the bathing medium. Transepithelial transport of 45Ca2+ across confluent MDCK cells was evaluated as described previously (12Giuliano A.R. Wood R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: G207-G212PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, at time 0, a transport buffer containing 0.5 μCi/ml 45Ca2+ was poured into the filter well or the outside compartment. The transport buffer contained 140 mm NaCl, 5.8 mm KCl, 0.34 mm Na2HPO4, 0.44 mm KH2PO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 25 mm glucose, and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. As indicated, the concentration of MgCl2 was changed from 0 to 10 mm. The reverse compartment was filled with the transport buffer without 45Ca2+, CaCl2, and MgCl2. The filter plates were shaken horizontally at a frequency of 50 oscillations/min at room temperature. To evaluate the permeability of the monolayers, the opposite compartment media were collected after indicated periods. The amount of 45Ca2+ was determined with a liquid scintillation counter. Electrophysiological Studies with the Ussing Chamber—Cells were plated at confluent densities on transwells with polyester membrane inserts. The filter rings were detached and mounted in Ussing chambers that were incubated in the transport buffer at 37 °C. The fluid volume on each side of the filter was 4 ml. 45Ca2+ transport was measured under short-circuit conditions with an amplifier (CEZ9100, Nihon Kohden, Tokyo, Japan). The transepithelial voltage was clamped at -10, 0, or +10 mV. A time 0, the transport buffer containing 0.5 μCi/ml 45Ca2+ was added to one side. After 30 min, 1 ml of the transport solution was collected from the trans compartment for liquid scintillation counting. Statistics—Results are presented as means ± S.E. Differences between groups were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance, and correction for multiple comparison was made using Tukey's multiple comparison test. Significant differences were assumed at p < 0.05. Association of the C-terminal Domain of PCLN-1 with ZO-1— PCLN-1 has a typical PDZ-binding motif, TRV, at the C terminus. Here we examined whether the C terminus of PCLN-1 can associate with ZO-1. The cytoplasmic C-terminal domain of PCLN-1 was expressed as a fusion protein with GST and immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Fig. 1A). ZO-1 associated with the wild-type PCLN-1 but not with GST alone (Fig. 1B). The alanine substitution mutant for arginine (TAV) of the PDZ-binding motif bound to ZO-1, similarly to the wild-type, but the deletion mutant (ΔTRV) and the alanine substitution mutants for threonine (ARV) or valine (TRA) did not. Our point substitution studies indicated that C-terminal threonine and valine are critical residues in the association of PCLN-1 with ZO-1. Co-immunoprecipitation of PCLN-1 with ZO-1—It was reported that myc-tagged or hemagglutinin-tagged claudin family proteins were concentrated with occludin at TJ when they were introduced into MDCK cells (13Kobayashi J. Inai T. Shibata Y. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 117: 29-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 14Morita K. Furuse M. Fujimoto K. Tsukita S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar). We examined whether the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of PCLN-1 affects the localization of PCLN-1 at TJ. The wild-type and the mutants of FLAG-tagged PCLN-1 were stably expressed in MDCK cells. These cell lines equally expressed FLAG-tagged PCLN-1 proteins (Fig. 2). Mock MDCK cells showed no expression of endogenous PCLN-1. The introductions did not affect endogenous occludin and ZO-1 expressions. ZO-1 was co-immunoprecipitated with the wild-type PCLN-1 indicating that exogenous PCLN-1 could interact with endogenous ZO-1. ZO-1 was also co-immunoprecipitated with the TAV mutant. By contrast, ZO-1 could not be co-immunoprecipitated with the ΔTRV, ARV, and TRA mutants. These results are similar to those of the GST pull-down assay (Fig. 1) indicating that the association of PCLN-1 with ZO-1 requires the C-terminal threonine and valine residues of PCLN-1. Association of PCLN-1 with ZO-1 Is Essential for the Localization of PCLN-1 at TJ—The deletion mutants of the cytosolic C-terminal domain of occludin and claudin-1 inhibited the association between occludin and ZO-1 and the localization of these molecules at TJ (13Kobayashi J. Inai T. Shibata Y. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 117: 29-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 15Furuse M. Itoh M. Hirase T. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1617-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). However, these mutants were expressed in the lateral membranes without binding to ZO-1. We examined the localization of FLAG-tagged PCLN-1 in MDCK cells. Expression levels of the wild-type PCLN-1 and the mutants were same as judged from the levels of FLAG expression (Fig. 3, green fluorescence). These results are similar to those of the Western blotting (Fig. 2). The xz-scan images showed that merged yellow spots (Fig. 3) appeared near the most apical regions in the wild-type and TAV mutant, indicating these proteins were co-localized with ZO-1 at the TJ. In contrast, green fluorescence of merged images in the middle position was detected in mutants of ΔTRV, ARV, and TRA. Furthermore, these mutants were widely distributed in the lateral membrane including the TJ area, as shown by xz-scan imaging, indicating that PCLN-1 is distributed in the plasma membrane without binding to ZO-1. These results suggest that the association of PCLN-1 with ZO-1 is necessary for the concentration of PCLN-1 at TJ. Expression of PCLN-1 Increases TER—The mock and PCLN-1-transfected cells were cultured in transwell inserts. In the mock cells, the TER value rose during 3 days and reached a maximum (139.2 ± 4.8 ohm × cm2). TER then decreased to a value of 70.1 ± 2.2 ohm × cm2 after 7 days. This value remained constant for up to 2 weeks after plating. The values and the pattern of time-dependent change of TER were similar to those in previous reports (16Yu A.S. Enck A.H. Lencer W.I. Schneeberger E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17350-17359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 17Hasegawa H. Fujita H. Katoh H. Aoki J. Nakamura K. Ichikawa A. Negishi M.

Schneeberger E.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3387-3398PubMed Google Scholar). The peak and steady state values of TER were compared among mock, wild-type, and mutant cells (Fig. 4, A and B). In the wild-type and TAV mutants, both peak and steady states values of TER were higher than those in the mock, ΔTRV, ARV, and TRA mutants. These results indicated that the barrier function was enhanced by the expression of wild-type and TAV mutant at TJ. Expression of PCLN-1 Increases Transepithelial 45Ca2+ Transport—To functionally characterize the wild-type and the mutants of PCLN-1 expressed in MDCK cells, we measured transepithelial 45Ca2+ transport. Because the MDCK cell monolayer at day 7 in culture showed steady state TER and low permeability of fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran 20,000 (data not shown), we used these cells for the assay. 45Ca2+ transport from apical to basal compartments increased time dependently in mock cells (Fig. 5A). In the cells expressing wild-type PCLN-1, 45Ca2+ transport from apical to basal compartments was higher than that of mock cells. On the contrary, the values of 45Ca2+ transport from basal to apical compartments were the same between the mock cells and the cells expressing the wild-type PCLN-1 (Fig. 5B). At 60-min time points, the net 45Ca2+ transport values from apical to basal compartments in the wild-type and TAV mutant were significantly higher than those in the mock, ΔTRV, ARV, and TRA mutants (Fig. 5C). These results indicate that the association of PCLN-1 with ZO-1 is necessary for the functional expression of PCLN-1 protein in MDCK cells. Next, we examined the effect of extracellular magnesium concentration on 45Ca2+ transport. The addition of MgCl2 in the apical compartment led to a decrease in 45Ca2+ transport in cells expressing the wild-type PCLN-1 (Fig. 6A). However, the change in 45Ca2+ transport by the addition of MgCl2 was not observed in the mock cells. It was noted that 45Ca2+ transport from basal to apical compartments was also unaffected by MgCl2. These results indicated that the PCLN-1·ZO-1 complex competitively transports calcium and magnesium from apical to basal compartments.Fig. 6Inhibition of transepithelial 45Ca2+ transport by magnesium. A, mock (open columns) and wild-type PCLN-1 (hatched columns)-expressing cells were cultured on transwell inserts for 7 days. 45Ca2+ was added to the apical compartment, and then the basal compartment was collected after 60 min. The concentration of MgCl2 was changed from 0 to 10 mm in the transport solution of the apical compartment. CaCl2 concentration was invariable at 1 mm. B, 45Ca2+ was added to the basal compartment, and then the apical compartment was collected after 60 min. The concentration of MgCl2 was changed from 0 to 10 mm in the transport solution of the basal compartment. n = 4. **, significantly different from mock cells (p < 0.01). NS, not significantly different (p > 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Effect of the Electric Potential Gradient on Transepithelial 45Ca2+ Transport—As shown in Fig. 5, PCLN-1 enhanced unidirectional 45Ca2+ transport from apical to basal compartments. Next, we examined the effects of electrical potential gradients on 45Ca2+ transport. The cell layer on the membrane filter was mounted in Ussing chambers and bathed with the transport solution. The values of transepithelial potential in the mock cells and the cells expressing the wild-type PCLN-1 were 0.45 ± 0.03 mV (n = 18) and 0.43 ± 0.03 mV (n = 18) with the apical surface negative, respectively. When the transepithelial potential was clamped at 0 mV, the 45Ca2+ transport from apical to basal compartments in the PCLN-1 expressing cells was larger than that in the mock cells (Fig. 7A). The difference in 45Ca2+ transport became larger at +10 mV. It was noted that 45Ca2+ transport from basal to apical compartments of the mock cells was similar to that of the cells expressing the wild-type PCLN-1 (Fig. 7B). These results suggest that divalent cations are reabsorbed by PCLN-1 according to the electrical potential gradient. The paracellular pathway of renal tubules has paradoxical roles, the reabsorption of solutes and acting as a transepithelial barrier. Unlike transmembrane ion channels, the paracellular pathway shows selectivity for net charges rather than for specific ions. These functions are facilitated by occludin and claudin family. PCLN-1 is a cogent protein that undertakes calcium and magnesium reabsorption in the TAL of Henle. Various mutations of PCLN-1 within the extracellular loops or the transmembrane domains have been identified in patients with FHHNC (4Simon D.B. Lu Y. Choate K.A. Velazquez H. Al-Sabban E. Praga M.

So far, biochemical and cell biological characterizations of the PDZ-binding motif of PCLN-1 have not been examined. In the present study, we revealed that the Thr and Val residues, but not the Arg residue, of the PDZ-binding motif are essential for the association of PCLN-1 with ZO-1 using the GST pull-down assay and immunoprecipitation analysis. If PCLN-1 is free from ZO-1, most of the PCLN-1 is not localized in TJ but in the lateral membrane of MDCK cells. However, only a small quantity of mutants that are free from ZO-1 may localize at TJ, because the merged yellow fluorescence of PCLN-1 and ZO-1 was indistinctly detected near the apical side (Fig. 3). Similarly, myc-tagged claudin-1, which may interfere with its association with ZO-1, has been reported to be distributed in the lateral membrane of MDCK cells (18McCarthy K.M. Francis S.A.

Our results suggest that ZO-1 plays a critical role in the localization of PCLN-1 at TJ. The properties of claudin-1, -2, -4, -8, and -15 have been well characterized in the over-expression model of MDCK cells. Claudin-1 increases TER, and the flux of small solutes such as mannitol and fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (18McCarthy K.M. Francis S.A. McCormack J.M. Lai J. Rogers R.A. Skare I.B. Lynch R.D. Schneeberger E.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3387-3398PubMed Google Scholar). Claudin-4 decreases paracellular conductance resulting from a selective decrease in Na+ permeability (22Van Itallie C. Rahner C. Anderson J.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 1319-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Claudin-8 increases TER via the reduction of paracellular permeability to monovalent inorganic and organic cations and divalent cations (16Yu A.S. Enck A.H. Lencer W.I. Schneeberger E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17350-17359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In contrast, claudin-2 increases paracellular cation conductance without changing mannitol flux (23Amasheh S. Meiri N. Gitter A.H. Schöneberg T. Mankertz J. Schulzke J.D. Fromm M. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4969-4976Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Our present results showed for the first time that the PCLN-1·ZO-1 complex increases TER and the paracellular permeability of divalent cations. Thus, the effects of claudins on TER and paracellular ion selectivity are type-specific. Why did PCLN-1 expression cause increased divalent cation transport despite an increase in TER in MDCK cells? We hypothesize that PCLN-1 expression increases protein density in restricted TJ areas, because it did not change the expression level of endogenous occludin, and PCLN-1 constructs a pore that is selectively permeable to divalent cations. In the mock cells and cells expressing wild-type PCLN-1, the removal of Na+ or Cl- from the bathing media increased TER, but Mg2+ removal did not change TER (data not shown). Similarly, paradoxical increases in TER and the paracellular flux of mannitol and dextran were observed in MDCK cells expressing occludin (24Balda M.S. Whitney J.A. Flores C. Gonzalez S. Cereijido M. Matter K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1031-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar) and claudin-1 (18McCarthy K.M. Francis S.A. McCormack J.M. Lai J. Rogers R.A. Skare I.B. Lynch R.D. Schneeberger E.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3387-3398PubMed Google Scholar). PCLN-1 did not affect endogenous ZO-1 levels, consistent with previous reports on claudin-1 (18McCarthy K.M. Francis S.A. McCormack J.M. Lai J. Rogers R.A. Skare I.B. Lynch R.D. Schneeberger E.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3387-3398PubMed Google Scholar) and claudin-4 expression (22Van Itallie C. Rahner C. Anderson J.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 1319-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). The deletion of the PDZ-binding motif (YV) at the C terminus of claudin-1–8 was enough to inhibit the association of claudins with ZO-1, but the mutants could be still distributed at the TJ (9Itoh M. Furuse M. Morita K. Kubota K. Saitou M. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1351-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). On the contrary, PCLN-1 mutants with the substitution of Thr for Arg at the C terminus led to lysosomal mistargeting (21Müller D. Kausalya P.J. Claverie-Martin F. Meij I.C. Eggert P. Garcia-Nieto V. Hunziker W. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2003; 73: 1293-1301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). We found that PCLN-1 mutants can be incorporated in TJ to some extent without binding to ZO-1 (Fig. 3) but could not record lysosomal mistargeting, because the mutants were widely distributed in the lateral membrane. The mutants unbound to ZO-1 did not increase both TER and divalent cation permeability. We suggest that ZO-1 is arranged by the dissociation of other complexes and concentrates PCLN-1 at the TJ. However, it is difficult to prove this hypothesis, because the stoichiometry of occludin and claudins in a single TJ fibril and their oligomerization into heteromeric and heterotypic assemblies are still unknown. The reabsorption of magnesium and calcium in TAL occurs passively via the paracellular pathway under the apical-positive transepithelial potential difference (25Quamme G.A. Kidney Int. 1997; 52: 1180-1195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 26Monnens L. Starremans P. Bindels R. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 2000; 15: 568-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Our present results indicate that calcium can be transported across monolayers of MDCK cells grown on permeable filters. PCLN-1 increased calcium transport from apical to basal compartments without affecting transport from basal to apical compartments. Furthermore, the apical-positive potential gradient enhanced calcium transport from apical to basal compartments. Interestingly, magnesium inhibited calcium transport in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that PCLN-1 recognizes divalent positive charges. Negative residues on its extracellular loops are suggested to form paracellular channels selective for divalent cations (4Simon D.B. Lu Y. Choate K.A. Velazquez H. Al-Sabban E. Praga M. Casari G. Bettinelli A. Colussi G. Rodriguez-Soriano J. McCredie D. Milford D. Sanjad S. Lifton R.P. Science. 1999; 285: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). In the case of claudin-4, substitution of a negative charge for a positive one at position 65 in the first extracellular loop increases paracellular Na+ permeability (27Colegio O.R. Van Itallie C.M. McCrea H.J. Rahner C. Anderson J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C142-C147Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). On the contrary, substitutions of positive for negative charges at three positions in the first extracellular loop of claudin-15 increase Cl- permeability. We hypothesize that the first extracellular loop of PCLN-1 looks toward the apical side and PCLN-1 can recognize divalent cations in the apical compartment. In addition, the elevation of divalent cations in the basal compartment may inhibit calcium transport via PCLN-1. The extracellular calcium/polyvalent cation-sensing protein is expressed in the basal membrane of epithelial cells in the proximal tubule, TAL, and distal tubule (28Riccardi D. Hall A.E. Chattopadhyay N. Xu J.Z. Brown E.M. Hebert S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F611-F622PubMed Google Scholar). It has been reported that the elevation of either basal calcium or magnesium decreases the reabsorption of calcium and magnesium in TAL (29Quamme G.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: F197-F210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further studies are required to clarify the residues involved in the recognition of divalent cations in PCLN-1. In conclusion, the expression of the wild-type and TAV mutant of PCLN-1 increased TER and divalent cation permeability in accordance with the association between PCLN-1 and ZO-1, indicating that both Thr and Val residues at the C terminus of PCLN-1 are necessary for constructing the protein complex of functional TJ. Calcium transport from apical to basal compartments was regulated by the transepithelial potential gradient. In patients with FHHNC, mutations of PCLN-1 cause renal magnesium wasting, resulting in the development of nephrocalcinosis. The PCLN-1·ZO-1 complex at TJ may be essential for the reabsorption of divalent cations in renal epithelial cells."

Here we show that through mutagenesis of three active site residues, the catalytic activity of a multicomponent monooxygenase is altered so that it hydroxylates all three positions of toluene as well as both positions of naphthalene. Hence, for the first time, an enzyme has been engineered so that its regiospecific oxidation of a substrate can be controlled. Through the A107G mutation in the α-subunit of toluene para-monooxygenase, a variant was formed that hydroxylated toluene primarily at the ortho-position while converting naphthalene to 1-naphthol. Conversely, the A107T variant produced >98% p-cresol and p-nitrophenol from toluene and nitrobenzene, respectively, as well as produced 2-naphthol from naphthalene. The mutation I100S/G103S produced a toluene para-monooxygenase variant that formed 75% m-cresol from toluene and 100% m-nitrophenol from nitrobenzene; thus, for the first time a true meta-hydroxylating toluene monooxygenase was created.

Enzymes are attractive catalysts for chemical synthesis because of their exceptional enantio- and regioselectivities; hence, enzymes can be used in both simple and complex syntheses without the need for the blocking and deblocking steps often found in their organic counterparts (1Schmid A. Dordick J.S. Hauer B. Kiener A. Wubbolts M. Witholt B. Nature. 2001; 409: 258-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (2008) Google Scholar, 2Schoemaker H.E. Mink D. Wubbolts M.G. Science. 2003; 299: 1694-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). The number of biocatalytic processes that are being performed on a large scale is rapidly increasing, and it is projected that this growth will continue (3Straathof A.J.J. Panke S. Schmid A. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2002; 13: 548-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar, 4Kirk O. Borchert T.V. Fuglsang C.C. Curr. Opin.

Trends Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 170-177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Although the majority of currently used industrial enzymes are hydrolases (4Kirk O. Borchert T.V. Fuglsang C.C. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2002; 13: 345-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar), there is growing interest in the application of oxygenases (5van Beilen J.B. Duetz W.A. Schmid A. Witholt B. Trends Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 170-177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Oxidative biotransformations use oxygen as an inexpensive, environmentally friendly oxidant in contrast to toxic chemical oxidants, and they exceed their chemical equivalent in regiospecificity and enantioselectivity (6Li Z. van Beilen J.B.

Trends Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 543-549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Among bacterial oxygenases, toluene monooxygenases have a lot of potential for bioremediation and chemical synthesis, as we have used mutagenesis to make, among other things, variants that remediate one of the world's worst pollutants (trichloroethylene) (8Canada K.A. Iwashita S. Shim H. Wood T.K. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 344-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), form a rainbow of colors from indole with a single enzyme, and make the anti-cancer compound indirubin (9Rui L. Reardon K.F. Wood T.K. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2005; 66: 422-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). These variants also make useful compounds like 1-naphthol (15,000 ton/year market) (8Canada K.A. Iwashita S. Shim H. Wood T.K. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 344-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), nitrohydroquinone (precursor for therapeutics for Alzheimer and Parkinson disease) (10Vardar G. Ryu K. Wood T.K. J. Biotechnol. 2005; 115: 145-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and 4-nitrocatechol (inhibitor of nitric-oxide synthase) (11Fishman A. Tao Y. Bentley W.E. Wood T.K. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2004; 87: 779-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For these industrial applications, control of regiospecific oxidation of aromatics is of vital importance. Further, regiospecific oxidation of toluene, substituted benzenes, and naphthalene by these monooxygenases presents an important challenge both in terms of the three distinct regiospecific oxidations possible for the initial hydroxylation of toluene as well as in terms of the usefulness of both the mono- and dihydroxylated products.

Olsen R.H. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 154: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). TbuA1, TbuA2, and TbuU are the α-, β-, and γ-subunits, respectively, of the hydroxylase component (209 kDa with α2β2γ2 quaternary structure), which controls regiospecificity (14Pikus J.D.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3176-3188Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). TbuB is a Rieske-type [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin (12.3 kDa), and TbuV is an effector protein (11.7 kDa). TbuC is an NADH oxidoreductase (36.1 kDa) that is responsible for the transfer of electrons from reduced nucleotides via the redox center to the terminal oxygenase (13Byrne A.M. Kukor J.J. Olsen R.H. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 154: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). R. pickettii PKO1 cells expressing the TpMO pathway were shown to degrade trichloroethylene when induced by toluene or trichloroethylene (16Park J. Kukor J.J. Abriola L.M. Appl. Environ.

The original characterization of TpMO as a meta-hydroxylating enzyme that is capable of transforming toluene to m-cresol (18Olsen R.H. Kukor J.J. Kaphammer B. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3749-3756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was found to be incorrect, as Wood and co-workers (19Fishman A. Tao Y. Wood T.K. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 3117-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) have shown that TpMO produces 90% p-cresol and 10% m-cresol from toluene and successively oxidizes these to 4-methyl catechol. This result is in agreement with the work of Tao et al. (20Tao Y. Fishman A. Bentley W.E. Wood T.K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2004; 70: 3814-3820Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and Vardar and Wood (21Vardar G. Wood T.K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2004; 70: 3253-3262Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), which shows that the four monooxygenases, TpMO, toluene 4-monooxygenase (T4MO) of Pseudomonas mendocina KR1, toluene ortho-monooxygenase (TOM) of Burkholeria cepacia G4, and toluene o-xylene monooxygenase (ToMO) of Pseudomonas stutzeri OX1 hydroxylate benzene successively to phenol, catechol, and 1,2,3-trihydroxybenzene. Fox and co-workers (14Pikus J.D. Mitchell K.H. Studts J.M. McClay K. Steffan R.J. Fox B.G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 791-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 15Mitchell K.H. Studts J.M.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9283-9289Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) previously found mutations in the related enzyme T4MO of P. mendocina KR1 that influence its regiospecificity. From toluene, the α-subunit variant TmoA T201F yielded nearly equal amounts of o- and p-cresol (49.1 and 46.6%, respectively) and a substantial amount of benzyl alcohol (11.5%) compared with the wild-type enzyme, which makes 97% p-cresol and 3% m-cresol (14Pikus J.D. Mitchell K.H. Studts J.M. McClay K. Steffan R.J. Fox B.G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 791-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). F205I, another beneficial T4MO TmoA mutant, produced 81% p-cresol, 14.5% m-cresol, and insignificant amounts of o-cresol and benzyl alcohol (22Pikus J.D. Studts J.M. McClay K. Steffan R.J. Fox B.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9283-9289Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The most notable change was found with mutant TmoA G103L, which influenced the selectivity for ortho-hydroxylation of toluene, yielding 55.4% o-cresol (15Mitchell K.H. Studts J.M. Fox B.G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3176-3188Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Tao et al. (23Tao Y. Fishman A. Bentley W.E. Wood T.K. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 4705-4713Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) reported the α-subunit positions Gly-103 and Ala-107 of T4MO influenced the rate and regiospecific oxidation of o-methoxyphenol (o-MP) and o-cresol. A double mutant, G103A/A107S, produced 83% 3-methoxycatechol from o-MP 7-fold faster than wild-type T4MO, which produced 87% 4-methoxyresorcinol (23Tao Y. Fishman A. Bentley W.E. Wood T.K. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 4705-4713Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The analogous position to TmoA Ala-107 in TOM of B. cepacia G4, TomA3 Ala-113, was also shown to influence the regiospecific oxidation of indigoids (9Rui L. Reardon K.F. Wood T.K. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2005; 66: 422-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). For example, variant TomA3 A113V oxidized indole to 89% indigo and variant A113I produced 64% indirubin, whereas the wild-type produces 86% isoindigo. Fishman et al. (11Fishman A. Tao Y. Bentley W.E. Wood T.K. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2004; 87: 779-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) revealed that position TmoA Ile-100 of T4MO is also important for regiospecific oxidation in that variants I100S and I100A produced m-nitrophenol from nitrobenzene, whereas the wild-type enzyme produced p-nitrophenol. A recent report on the mutagenesis of TOM of B. cepacia G4 (24Rui L. Kwon Y. Fishman A. Reardon K.F. Wood T.K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2004; 70: 3246-3252Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) indicated that the analogous position to T4MO TmoA Ile-100, TomA3 Val-106, changes the regiospecificity of TOM from a conserved ortho-hydroxylating enzyme to a nonspecific catalyst, producing all three cresol isomers from toluene. Recently, the crystal structure of ToMO of P. stutzeri OX1 was published, shedding light on the importance of various active site residues on the catalytic activity of this enzyme (25Sazinsky M.H. Bard J. Di Donato A. Lippard S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30600-30610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Currently there are no reports on the mutagenesis of TpMO. As there is no known enzyme that hydroxylates primarily at the meta-position for toluene (19Fishman A. Tao Y. Wood T.K. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 3117-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), we were interested in performing mutagenesis on TpMO to enable it to make substantial amounts of meta-hydroxylated compounds from substituted benzenes. Furthermore, we also wanted to fine-tune the regiospecificity of TpMO, via saturation or site-directed mutagenesis, to render it an ortho-hydroxylating enzyme similar to TOM or a more complete para-hydroxylating enzyme than even wild-type T4MO. It was found that positions Ile-100, Gly-103, and Ala-107 in the TbuA1 hydroxylase subunit govern these changes in regiospecificity. This is the first report of the transformation of a single enzyme into a regiospecific catalyst that hydroxylates the aromatic ring at all possible positions, producing ortho-, meta-, and para-cresols from toluene and producing 1- and 2-naphthol from naphthalene. (There are no previous reports of producing 2-naphthol with microorganisms, and the Western world demand for 2-naphthol is 3-fold greater than for 1-naphthol (26Howe-Grant M. Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology. 16. Wiley-Interscience Publishers, New York1991: 994-1017Google Scholar).) Evidence of these regiospecific shifts are also shown with nitrobenzene and methoxybenzene. Structure-function relationships of the mutants were probed based on substrate and product docking into the active site of the TpMO variants. Chemicals—Nitrobenzene (NB) and naphthalene were purchased from Fisher, and p-cresol, methoxybenzene (MB), benzyl alcohol, 3-methoxyphenol (m-MP), o-nitrophenol (o-NP), m-nitrophenol (m-NP), and p-nitrophenol (p-NP) were obtained from Acros Organics (Morris Plains, NJ). o-Cresol, m-cresol, 1-naphthol, 2-naphthol, 4-methoxyphenol (p-MP), and 2-methoxyphenol (guaiacol, o-MP) were obtained from Aldrich. All materials used were of the highest purity available and were used without further purification. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—Escherichia coli TG1 (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

To stably and constitutively express the toluene monooxygenase genes from the same promoter, the expression vectors pBS(Kan)TOM (8Canada K.A. Iwashita S. Shim H. Wood T.K. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 344-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), pBS(Kan)TpMO (20Tao Y. Fishman A. Bentley W.E. Wood T.K. Appl. Environ.

Microbiol. 2004; 70: 3814-3820Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), were constructed as described earlier. All experiments were conducted by diluting overnight cells to an optical density (OD) at 600 nm of 0.1 to 0.2 and growing to an OD of 1.2. The exponentially grown cells were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 8 min at 25 °C in a Beckman J2-HS centrifuge and resuspended in Tris-HNO3 buffer (50 mm, pH 7.0) or potassium phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 7.0) for performing the desired oxidation reaction. Expression of wild-type TpMO from pBS(Kan)TpMO (henceforth TG1(TpMO)) or T4MO from pBS(Kan)T4MO (henceforth TG1(T4MO)) within E. coli strains produced blue-colored cells on agar plates and in broth cultures. The blue color is indicative of indigo, formed by oxidation of indole from tryptophan (28Eaton R.W. Chapman P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6983-6988Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of wild-type TOM from pBS(Kan)TOM (henceforth TG1(TOM)) within E. coli strains produced the normal brown-colored cells on agar plates and in broth cultures (29Luu P.P. Yung C.W. A Sun K.-Y Wood T.K. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1995; 44: 259-264Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar) as a result of isoindigo formation (9Rui L. Reardon K.F. Wood T.K. Appl. Microbiol.

Protein Analysis and Plasmid Manipulation—Cellular protein samples of cells grown with and without 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside were analyzed on standard 12% Laemmli discontinuous SDS-polyacrylamide gels (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar).

Two PCRs were conducted to randomize or specifically change the desired position at one end of the fragment while introducing a restriction site for cloning at the opposite end. A third PCR reaction using the two initial fragments as templates was performed to obtain the final fragment with the two cloning sites at the ends. The resulting PCR product containing randomized nucleotides at TbuA1 position 100, 103, or 107 was cloned into pBS(Kan)TpMO after double digestion with KpnI and BclI, replacing the corresponding fragment in the original plasmid. The four primers used to obtain mutations in the positions TbuA1 Ile-100, TbuA1 Gly-103, and TbuA1 Ala-107 are shown in Table I. Screening Method—The screening method used to identify mutants with a different activity than wild-type TpMO was described earlier (11Fishman A. Tao Y. Bentley W.E. Wood T.K. Biotechnol.

Briefly, the E. coli TG1 transformants were plated on a Luria-Bertani agar plate containing 100 μg/ml kanamycin and 1% w/v glucose. Following overnight incubation at 37 °C, the colonies were transferred to Luria-Bertani plates containing 100 μg/ml kanamycin and 1 mm desired substrate using a nylon membrane. The substrates used in this work were toluene, NB, MB, o-cresol, and o-MP. Colonies exhibiting halo colors or intensities different from wild-type TpMO on the nylon membranes were further evaluated for their regiospecificity on substituted benzenes. Enzymatic Activity—Oxidation of NB, MB, and naphthalene was determined using reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Two milliliters of concentrated cell suspensions (OD of 8) in Tris-HNO3 buffer (50 mm, pH 7.0) were contacted with substrates at concentrations specified in Table II (from a 100-mm stock solution in ethanol) in 15-ml serum vials sealed with Teflon-coated septa and aluminum crimp seals. The negative controls used in these experiments contained the same monooxygenase without substrates (plus solvent) as well as TG1/pBS(Kan) with substrates (no monooxygenase control). The inverted vials were shaken at room temperature at 300 rpm on an IKA-Vibrax-VXR shaker (Cincinnati, OH) for 2.5-30 min, and then 1 ml of the cell suspension was removed and centrifuged in a 16 m Labnet Spectrafuge (Edison, NJ) for 1-2 min. The supernatant was filtered and analyzed. Toluene oxidation was performed as described earlier (24Rui L. Kwon Y. Fishman A. Reardon K.F. Wood T.K. Appl. Environ.

Filtered samples were injected into a Zorbax SB-C8 column (Agilent Technologies, 5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm) with a Waters Corporation (Milford, MA) 515-solvent delivery system coupled to a photodiode array detector (Waters 996). The gradient elution for detecting NB oxidation products was performed with H2O (0.1% formic acid) and acetonitrile (70:30 for 0-8 min, gradient to 40:60 at 15 min, and gradient to 70:30 at 20 min) as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 ml/min.

For naphthalene oxidation products, the gradient elution was gradient at 65:35 for 0-5 min, gradient to 35:65 at 12 min, and gradient to 65:35 at 20 min. Compounds were identified by comparing retention times and UV-visible spectra with those of authentic standards as well as by co-elution with standards.

Polar hydrogen atoms were added to the protein, and charges were assigned to each atom using AutoDockTools. The structures of the ligand molecules toluene, m-cresol, and p-cresol were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (accession codes 1R1X, 1EV6, and 1JHV, respectively); the structure of o-cresol was generated by Chem3D (CambridgeSoft Inc., Cambridge, MA); and energy was minimized by MOPAC using the PM3 Hamiltonian (CAChe Group, Beaverton, OR). Prior to automatic docking using AutoDock, the ligand coordinates were manually modified so they were near the active site center of TpMO α-subunit model.

https://openalex.org/W2112154187,"A majority of the orthopoxviruses, including the variola virus that causes the dreaded smallpox disease, encode a highly conserved 28-kDa protein with a classic RING finger sequence motif (C3HC4) at their carboxyl-terminal domains. The RING domain of p28 has been shown to be a critical determinant of viral virulence for the ectromelia virus (mousepox virus) in a murine infection model (Senkevich, T. G., Koonin, E. V., and Buller, R. M. (1994) Virology 198, 118–128). Here, we demonstrate that the p28 proteins encoded by the ectromelia virus and the variola virus possess E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in biochemical assays as well as in cultured mammalian cells. Point mutations disrupting the RING finger domain of p28 completely abolish its E3 ligase activity. In addition, p28 functions cooperatively with Ubc4 and UbcH5c, the E2 conjugating enzymes involved in 26 S proteasome degradation of protein targets. Moreover, p28 catalyzes the formation of Lys-63-linked polyubiquitin chains in the presence of Ubc13/Uev1A, a heterodimeric E2 conjugating enzyme, indicating that p28 may regulate the biological activity of its cognate viral and/or host cell target(s) by Lys-63-linked ubiquitin multimers. We thus conclude that the poxvirus p28 virulence factor is a new member of the RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase family and has a unique polyubiquitylation activity. We propose that the E3 ligase activity of the p28 virulence factor may be targeted for therapeutic intervention against infections by the variola virus and other poxviruses.

Genus Orthopoxvirus of virus family Poxviridae encompasses such complex double-stranded DNA viruses as variola virus (VARV), 1The abbreviations used are: VARV, variola virus; ECTV, ectromelia virus; EVP28, ECTV p28; SP28, VARV p28; KRAB, Krüppel-associated box; KAP1, KRAB-associated protein-1; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin conjugating enzyme; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; Ubc, ubiquitin-conjugating E2 enzyme; Uev, ubiquitin-conjugating E2 enzyme variant; TRAF6, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6; APC, anaphase-promoting complex; STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription; HMM, hidden Markov model; GST, glutathione S-transferase; ORF, open reading frame; TCEP, Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine. one of the most virulent human pathogens that causes smallpox, and vaccinia virus (VACV), the virus utilized in the smallpox vaccine. VARV is highly transmissible and causes up to 40% lethality, which puts it on the list of top high threat agents (1Harrison S.C. Alberts B. Ehrenfeld E. Enquist L. Fineberg H. McKnight S.L. Moss B. O'Donnell M. Ploegh H. Schmid S.L. Walter K.P. Theriot J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11178-11192Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Since the eradication of smallpox in 1980, our understanding of VARV replication has relied primarily on biological research involving VACV. However, VACV, the origin and natural host of which are unknown, has apparently lost some viral genes that are not essential for its replication in cell culture but required for infection of a natural host (2Moss B. Howley D.M.K.P.M. Fifth Ed. Fields Virology. 2. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 2849-2883Google Scholar). One such example is the poxvirus gene encoding a 28-kDa RING finger protein, which is highly conserved among the wild-type orthopoxviruses, such as ectromelia virus (ECTV, or mousepox virus), monkeypox virus, and VARV (see Fig. 1A). Previous studies suggest that an ECTV mutant lacking the p28 RING finger domain fails to replicate in murine peritoneal macrophages in vitro, although it replicates normally in other culture systems (3Senkevich T.G. Wolffe E.J. Buller R.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4103-4111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, this mutant ECTV was found to be highly attenuated in a murine infection model, with an LD50 (the viral dose that kills 50% of the infected animals) more than 6 orders of magnitude higher than that of wild-type ECTV (4Senkevich T.G. Koonin E.V. Buller R.M. Virology. 1994; 198: 118-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that the attenuation of this mutant ECTV is due to its inability to replicate in macrophage lineage cells at all successive steps in the spreading of the virus from the skin to its target organ, the liver (3Senkevich T.G. Wolffe E.J. Buller R.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4103-4111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additional insight regarding the mechanism of p28-mediated viral virulence derives from studies of both Shope fibroma virus and ECTV and indicates that p28 is involved in the inhibition of viral infection-induced apoptosis, thereby preventing abortive viral replication (5Brick D.J. Burke R.D. Schiff L. Upton C. Virology. 1998; 249: 42-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 6Brick D.J. Burke R.D. Minkley A.A. Upton C. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 1087-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Further attempts to study the biological activity of the p28 virulence factor have been hampered by the fact that recombinant p28 shows poor solubility in the bacterial host, as well as cytotoxicity and low expression in eukaryotic cells. As a result, the molecular mechanism of p28-mediated viral virulence remains elusive. Poxvirus p28 virulence factor is a protein of ∼240 amino acids, containing a RING finger motif (C3HC4) at its carboxyl-terminal domain (4Senkevich T.G. Koonin E.V. Buller R.M. Virology. 1994; 198: 118-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). It is highly conserved within the genus Orthopoxvirus and to a certain extent within the genera Leporipoxvirus and Suipoxvirus (Fig. 1A). For instance, the ECTV- and VARV-encoded p28 proteins have greater than 95% amino acid sequence identity, and their RING finger domains are identical (see Fig. 1B). Interestingly, the p28 gene products in culture-adapted VACV strains WR, COP, Ankara, MVA, and TIA are either truncated or interrupted (see Fig. 1B) (7Chen N. Danila M.I. Feng Z. Buller R.M. Wang C. Han X. Lefkowitz E.J. Upton C. Virology. 2003; 317: 165-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 8Gubser C. Hue S. Kellam P. Smith G.L. J. Gen. Virol. 2004; 85: 105-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The expression of ECTV p28 is driven by an early/intermediate viral promoter. The protein is translated in the early phase of viral replication, persists throughout the viral life cycle, and is localized to cytoplasmic virus factories in poxvirus-infected cells (3Senkevich T.G. Wolffe E.J. Buller R.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4103-4111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given the significant effect of the p28 RING finger on ECTV virulence and the absolute sequence conservation among the p28 RING domains of ECTV, VARV, and other wild-type orthopoxviruses, the p28 virulence factor could be an attractive antiviral target. The identification and characterization of the biochemical activity of p28 is critical for inhibitor screening and subsequent drug development. The p28 RING finger motif shares the highest homology with the RING finger region of the makorin protein family, the biological function of which is unknown (9Gray T.A. Hernandez L. Carey A.H. Schaldach M.A. Smithwick M.J. Rus K. Marshall Graves J.A. Stewart C.L. Nicholls R.D. Genomics. 2000; 66: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). RING fingers are Cys-rich zinc-binding domains identified in over 200 proteins to date. A few discrete biochemical activities have been attributed to RING finger domains. For example, the RING domains of the promyelocytic leukemia protein and the arenavirus-encoded Z protein bind the translation initiation factor eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) and significantly reduce the affinity between eukaryotic initiation factor 4E and the m7G cap of mRNA, thereby inhibiting mRNA transport and causing translational repression (10Kentsis A. Dwyer E.C. Perez J.M. Sharma M. Chen A. Pan Z.Q. Borden K.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 609-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In addition, the RING finger domain of KAP1 is critical to the formation of the KAP1/KRAB complex, which mediates transcriptional repression (11Peng H. Begg G.E. Schultz D.C. Friedman J.R. Jensen D.E. Speicher D.W. Rauscher F.J. II I J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 1139-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Significantly, a growing number of RING finger proteins have been identified as RING-class E3 ubiquitin ligases. The RING finger domain of E3 protein constitutes the binding site for its E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin from the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme to a protein target (12Pickart C.M. Cell. 2004; 116: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 13Jackson P.K. Eldridge A.G. Freed E. Furstenthal L. Hsu J.Y. Kaiser B.K. Reimann J.D. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 429-439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). An increasing amount of evidence supports the notion that viruses commonly utilize the cellular ubiquitylation pathway to regulate viral replication (Ref. 14Banks L. Pim D. Thomas M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 452-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar and references therein), and thus, the inhibition of a virus-specific ligase activity provides a new avenue for antiviral discovery. Here, we describe results from biochemical and cell culture analysis, demonstrating that the poxvirus p28 virulence factor is a new member of the RING class of E3 ubiquitin ligases. We have shown that mutagenesis of the zinc-coordinating residues of the carboxyl-terminal RING finger domain ablates the E3 ligase activity of p28. Moreover, the p28 E3 ligase not only cooperates with Ubc4 and UbcH5c, the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes known to be involved in polyubiquitylation for proteasome-mediated protein degradation, but also works with Ubc13/Uev1A, a heterodimeric E2 complex that has been shown to mediate the formation of unique Lys-63-linked polyubiquitin chains important for functional regulation of cellular signal transduction. Sequence Analysis—Sequences of the poxviruses p28 and related RING finger proteins were extracted from NCBI. Alignment of the three closely related poxvirus sequences was generated by ClustalW. Alignment of the distantly related RING finger proteins was constructed by the profile hidden Markov model (HMM) alignment package SAM. The profile HMM was built by choosing MDM2 as the seed sequence with four refinement iterations. The query sequences were aligned to the profile HMM afterward. Cloning and Mutagenesis—Synthetic oligonucleotides were designed to assemble the genes encoding EVP28 (p28 of the ectromelia virus, GenBank™ accession code NC_004105) or SP28 (p28 of the variola virus, GenBank™ accession code L22579). The synthetic EVP28 and SP28 genes were cloned into the TA vector (Invitrogen). The FLAG tag was then introduced by PCR to engineer amino-terminal-tagged EVP28 or SP28. Point mutations were introduced at the predicted zinc-coordinating residues (C172A or H198A for EVP28; C173A and/or H199A for SP28) using a Gene Tailor mutagenesis kit (Invitrogen). For mammalian cell expression, genes for FLAG-tagged EVP28 or SP28 were cloned into vector pNIG, in which the expression of p28 was driven by the EF-1α promoter, one of the strongest promoters identified in the literature (15Kim D.W. Uetsuki T. Kaziro Y. Yamaguchi N. Sugano S. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 91: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Recombinant Protein Expression and Purification—The wild-type EVP28, SP28, and their respective RING finger mutants (EVP28 C172A, EVP28 H198A, SP28 C173A, and SP28 H199A) were cloned into the pFast-Bac expression vector (Invitrogen) with an amino-terminal GST tag. Baculovirus production, protein expression, and purification were performed according to the manufacturer's protocols. The following is a brief description of the protocol for the purification of the GST·EVP28 fusion protein. High Five cells (Invitrogen) were inoculated with GST·EVP28 baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 1–10. The infected cells were grown for 40 h, collected by a 5-min centrifugation at 2,500 × g at 4 °C, and then lysed briefly at 4 °C in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, 15% glycerol, 0.5 m NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm TCEP at pH 8.0) containing protease inhibitors (20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin A). The lysate was sonicated and then clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 40 min. The supernatant was mixed with glutathione-agarose beads for 1 h. The pellet beads with bound GST·EVP28 were washed with buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, 15% glycerol, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm TCEP at pH 8.0) followed by elution with buffer C (20 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm glutathione, 15% glycerol, 0.05 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm TCEP at pH 8.0). The eluted protein was further purified by Q-Sepharose chromatography, and the purity of each fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Pure p28 fractions were pooled, dialyzed, and stored in aliquots at –80 °C. The same protocol was used to purify SP28 and its respective mutants. Human ubiquitin E1 was expressed as a His tag fusion protein in insect cells using the same Bac to Bac system (Invitrogen). Different human E2s were expressed as amino-terminal GST-tagged fusion proteins in Escherichia coli using the pGex-6p system (Amersham Biosciences). GST was cleaved following protein purification through a glutathione column. Ubiquitin was expressed with an amino-terminal FLAG epitope using the expression vector pFLAGMac (Sigma) and then purified from E. coli. Cell Fractionation and Western Blot—Approximately 107 HEK 293 cells transfected with pNIG vector or pNIG-SP28 were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) on ice for 15 min. The cellular membrane was disrupted gently with a Dounce tissue grinder (without breaking the nuclear membrane), the lysate was centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant was collected as the cytoplasmic fraction. The nuclear pellet was washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 1× protease inhibitor mixture. The nuclear membrane was disrupted by sonication for 20 s, and the lysate was further incubated on ice for 10 min and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was collected as the nuclear fraction. To analyze the level of expression and the intracellular distribution of p28, both the cytoplasmic and the nuclear fractions were immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG antibody as described above, the proteins on beads were eluted with 100 μl of FLAG peptide (100 μg/ml, Sigma), and 20 μl of each eluted sample was loaded on a gel and blotted with anti-FLAG antibody (1:2000, Sigma), or an anti-p28 polyclonal anti-serum (3Senkevich T.G. Wolffe E.J. Buller R.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4103-4111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Vitro Ubiquitin Ligase Assay—E1 (10 ng), E2 (25 ng), and SP28 or EVP28 (100 ng) were added to a ubiquitin ligase reaction mixture that contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.6 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μm ATP, and 100 ng of FLAG-ubiquitin. Each 100-μl reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 h, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 4× Laemmli loading buffer followed by standard SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with anti-FLAG or anti-GST antibodies. Phylogenetic Analysis of Poxvirus p28 RING Finger Proteins—As shown in Fig. 1A, the p28 proteins encoded by genus Orthopoxviruses (except those of the tissue culture-adapted VACV strains) have a high degree of sequence conservation at amino acid level. This homology is also found in the p28 homologues encoded by genera Leporipoxvirus and Suipoxvirus. In particular, the RING finger domains of the p28 proteins of the wild-type orthopoxviruses are almost identical. In contrast, the p28 gene products of culture-adapted VACV isolates contain large deletions that disrupt the RING finger domain (Fig. 1B). Coincidentally, VACV infection causes very mild symptoms in humans, a property that enables its use as a live vaccine for smallpox. Interestingly, the RING finger domain of p28 in ECTV has been found to enhance the virulence of the virus by over 106 times in a mouse infection model (4Senkevich T.G. Koonin E.V. Buller R.M. Virology. 1994; 198: 118-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), suggesting that the RING domain of p28, although redundant in cell culture, is associated with ECTV pathogenesis in the host. Although there has been no previously demonstrated evidence of p28-dependent virulence in other orthopoxviruses, it is very likely that, based on the high level of sequence conservation, p28 plays a similar role for this family of poxviruses, including VARV. The poxvirus p28 RING finger domain aligns with several well characterized cellular E3 ubiquitin ligases, with the most significant homology found between p28 and the makorin RING finger proteins, the biologic function of which is unknown (9Gray T.A. Hernandez L. Carey A.H. Schaldach M.A. Smithwick M.J. Rus K. Marshall Graves J.A. Stewart C.L. Nicholls R.D. Genomics. 2000; 66: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The conservation of residues between p28 and the cellular RING finger domains is relatively poor with the exception of the 7 cysteine and 1 histidine residues that chelate two zinc atoms (Fig. 1C). Despite the low homology between poxvirus p28 and host RING finger ligases, they may share a similar RING finger structural architecture (16Zheng N. Wang P. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 2000; 102: 533-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar, 17Zheng N. Schulman B.A. Song L. Miller J.J. Jeffrey P.D. Wang P. Chu C. Koepp D.M. Elledge S.J. Pagano M. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Harper J.W. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 2002; 416: 703-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar). It is likely that the dissimilarity in the RING finger may provide the molecular basis for specific recognition of these RING finger ligases with their respective E2s and protein substrates. Both ECTV- and VARV-encoded p28 Proteins Possess E3 Ubiquitin Ligase Activity—Attempts to express recombinant p28 in bacterial hosts failed due to the toxicity and poor solubility of the protein, as reported previously (3Senkevich T.G. Wolffe E.J. Buller R.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4103-4111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). p28 expression was achieved by using the baculovirus expression system in which the protein was fused to a GST tag at its amino terminus. Following differential centrifugation, glutathione-agarose bead affinity purification, and Q-Sepharose chromatography, the p28 proteins of ECTV and VARV, referred to herein as EVP28 and SP28, respectively, were obtained. The purity of the proteins was verified by SDS-PAGE analysis to be greater than 90% (Fig. 2A). Because a significant subset of the RING finger family of proteins has been found to be ubiquitin E3 ligases, we examined whether or not the poxvirus p28 virulence factors encoded E3 ligase activity. A substrate-independent in vitro ligase assay was used to monitor the formation of polyubiquitin chains in the presence of p28, a method commonly applied to analyze E3 ligases with unknown substrates (18Hofmann R.M. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27936-27943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2B, both GST·EVP28 and GST·SP28 strongly promoted the formation of a high molecular weight ladder/smear on the blot, an indication of ubiquitin polymerization. As expected, the ubiquitin polymerization was not detected in control reactions in which E1, E2, or p28 was excluded (Fig. 2B). The p28 E3 Ligase Activity Is RING Finger-dependent—To verify the importance of the RING finger in the E3 ligase activity of p28, point mutations were generated at the proposed zinc-binding residues of the RING domain (C173A or H199A in SP28; C172A or H198A in EVP28). GST-fused mutant SP28 and EVP28 proteins were purified to near homogeneity using glutathione affinity enrichment followed by Q-Sepharose chromatography and were tested for their E3 ligase activity in vitro. It was found that a single amino acid substitution at either residue Cys-172/3 or residue His-198/9 completely abolished the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of the p28 proteins, suggesting that the integrity of the RING finger domain is critical for its ligase activity (Fig. 3A). It has been shown that RING finger E3 ligases can mediate auto-ubiquitylation and substrate ubiquitylation, as well as the formation of unanchored polyubiquitin chains in vitro (19Deng L. Wang C. Spencer E. Yang L. Braun A. You J. Slaughter C. Pickart C. Chen Z.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1513) Google Scholar). Although the natural substrate(s) of p28 are not known, Western blot using a GST antibody was performed to determine whether p28 underwent auto-ubiquitylation in the biochemical reaction. Indeed, the formation of high molecular weight GST·SP28 or GST·EVP28 was readily detected in the blot, suggesting that a substantial portion of the polyubiquitin chains formed in the biochemical assay was the product of p28 auto-ubiquitylation (Fig. 3B). Consistent with the null phenotype of RING finger point mutants, p28 bearing either C172A/C1733A or H198A/H199A mutations showed no auto-ubiquitylation activity (Fig. 3B). p28 Cooperates with Different E2s to Catalyze Ubiquitylation—There are over 30 E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes in humans (20Wong B.R. Parlati F. Qu K. Demo S. Pray T. Huang J. Payan D.G. Bennett M.K. Drug Discov. Today. 2003; 8: 746-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), with a similar number of E2 homologues expected in mouse. To determine which E2s could cooperate with SP28 or EVP28, six different recombinant E2s were tested in the in vitro ligase assay. It was found that three of the E2s, Ubc4, UbcH5c, and Ubc13/Uev1A, were capable of working with p28 to promote polyubiquitin chain formation (Fig. 4, A and B). Ubc4 and UbcH5c share about 97% identity in protein sequence and have been shown to participate in catalyzing Lys-48-linked polyubiquitylation for proteasome recognition and subsequent protein degradation (21Pickart C.M. VanDemark A.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 999-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The heterodimeric Ubc13/Uev1A has been shown to work with a smaller subset of E3 ligases and plays a unique role in promoting the formation of Lys-63-linked multi- or polyubiquitin chains for a variety of cellular functions such as kinase activation (19Deng L. Wang C. Spencer E. Yang L. Braun A. You J. Slaughter C. Pickart C. Chen Z.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1513) Google Scholar), regulation of ribosome activity (22Spence J. Gali R.R. Dittmar G. Sherman F. Karin M. Finley D. Cell. 2000; 102: 67-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), and endocytosis (23Galan J.M. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5847-5854Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). We thus compared SP28 and several well characterized RING finger E3 ligases for their compatibility with Ubc13/Uev1A. Among these ligases, TRAF6 and SP28 cooperated well with Ubc13/Uev1A, whereas MDM2 and APC2/APC11 did not (Fig. 4C). The finding that SP28 and EVP28 can cooperate with different E2s suggests that p28 may be involved in both Lys-48- and Lys-63-linked ubiquitin polymerization and therefore may impact multiple cellular activities. p28 Catalyzes the Formation of Lys-63-linked Polyubiquitin Chains—Ubiquitin is one of the most highly conserved proteins in eukaryotes, and the 76-amino-acid-long human and mouse isoforms are identical. There are 7 Lys residues in human/mouse ubiquitin, including Lys-48 and Lys-63. Polyubiquitin chains linked via Lys-48 are structurally distinct from those linked via Lys-63, which might be the basis for their differential biological functions (24Varadan R. Assfalg M. Haririnia A. Raasi S. Pickart C. Fushman D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7055-7063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). To further investigate the possibility of Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chain formation by p28 E3 ligase and the heterodimeric Ubc13/UevA E2 complex, the in vitro ligase assay was performed using different forms of ubiquitin. As shown in Fig. 5, with Ubc13/UevA as an E2, SP28 catalyzed polyubiquitin chain formation in the presence of either wild-type ubiquitin or a mutant ubiquitin that contains only a single Lys residue at position 63 (Lys-63 only). In contrast, the formation of polyubiquitin chains was dramatically reduced in the same reaction using a mutant ubiquitin containing a single Lys residue at position 48 (Lys-48 only). Furthermore, a Lys-63 to Arg substitution in ubiquitin (K63R) abolished the generation of polyubiquitin chains by SP28, whereas replacing Lys-48 with an Arg residue had no significant effect (K48R). EVP28 displayed the same ubiquitin recognition profile in assays using Ubc13/Uev1A heterodimeric E2 (data not shown). A similar experiment using UbcH5c as an E2 failed to yield a conclusive result (data not shown). This is probably due to the fact that UbcH5c appears to be a highly robust E2 that has little ubiquitin substrate stringency in in vitro ligase assays. Our observations demonstrate that the poxvirus p28 E3 ligase is capable of catalyzing Lys-63-linked polyubiquitylation in concert with Ubc13/UevA. It raises the possibility that p28 ligases not only mediate the proteolytic destruction of their target protein(s) but may also play a role in functional regulation through a unique Lys-63-linked polyubiquitylation, as has been reported for a few other E3 ubiquitin ligases (19Deng L. Wang C. Spencer E. Yang L. Braun A. You J. Slaughter C. Pickart C. Chen Z.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1513) Google Scholar, 22Spence J. Gali R.R. Dittmar G. Sherman F. Karin M. Finley D. Cell. 2000; 102: 67-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 23Galan J.M. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5847-5854Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). p28 E3 Ligase Activity in Transfected Mammalian Cells—To verify that SP28 has ubiquitin E3 ligase activity in vivo, HEK293 cells were transfected with a FLAG-tagged SP28 expression vector, pNIG-FLAG-SP28. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were treated with 2 μm MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, for 6 h and then lysed in a buffer containing 10 μm MG132 to reduce 26 S proteasome-mediated degradation of SP28. The lysate was further fractionated by differential centrifugations into cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions. The samples were immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody, separated on an SDS-PAGE gel, and blotted with anti-p28 antibody (3Senkevich T.G. Wolffe E.J. Buller R.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4103-4111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to reveal the subcellular localization of SP28. As shown in Fig. 6A, SP28 was mainly detected in the cytoplasmic fraction of the cell lysate, an observation confirming a previous report that p28 is expressed as a cytosolic protein during ECTV infection (3Senkevich T.G. Wolffe E.J. Buller R.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4103-4111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, treating SP28-expressing cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 remarkably enhanced the stability of wild-type SP28 (Fig. 6B). The SP28 mutant with C173A/H199A substitutions, shown to have a null phenotype in E3 ligase assays, was also stabilized by MG132, although to a much lesser extent (Fig. 6B). A similar effect of MG132 on EVP28 was also observed (data not shown). The pronounced stabilization of wild-type p28 by MG132 suggests that SP28 is an active E3 ubiquitin ligase in cells. To further prove that SP28 expressed in mammalian cells encodes E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, HEK293 cells were transfected with pNIG vectors expressing either wild-type SP28 or its RING finger mutant (SP28 C173A/H199A), both tagged with an amino-terminal FLAG epitope. The cells were lysed in boiling lysis buffer to preserve polyubiquitin chains from degradation by deubiquitinating enzymes or proteases. The lysates were then analyzed by Western blot using a p28 polyclonal antibody. The results demonstrate that wild-type SP28, but not the C173A/H199A mutant, forms ubiquitin ladders in transfected cells (Fig. 6C). Thus we conclude that the poxvirus p28 virulence factor encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase that has activity in mammalian cells, and we have demonstrated that there is substantial SP28 self-ubiquitylation in cells as well as in biochemical assays. The poxvirus genome contains ∼200 distinct open reading frames (ORFs), 25% of which are “nonessential” for virus replication in cell culture (25Chen N. Buller R.M. Wall E.M. Upton C. Virus Res. 2000; 66: 155-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar); however, these ORFs are believed to play an important role in establishing productive viral infections in a host and are termed host response modifiers. A significant portion of host response modifier activity is involved in antagonizing host antiviral responses (2Moss B. Howley D.M.K.P.M. Fifth Ed. Fields Virology. 2. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 2849-2883Google Scholar). The ECTV p28 is a unique host response modifier that dramatically enhances the lethality of the virus in a murine infection model, with an unknown mechanism of action (4Senkevich T.G. Koonin E.V. Buller R.M. Virology. 1994; 198: 118-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The importance of p28 in poxvirus/host interactions is suggested by the virtual identity among p28 proteins encoded by ECTV, VARV, and the majority of the wild-type orthopoxviruses (Fig. 1). Elucidating the biochemical activity of p28 would provide clues regarding the biological function of the protein during poxvirus infection. The results described here demonstrate that the poxvirus p28 virulence factor encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase. p28 mutants lacking one of the proposed zinc-binding residues (C173A or H199A in SP28; C172A or H198A in EVP28) lose their ligase activity, confirming the crucial role of the RING finger domain in the enzymatic process. Although previous reports demonstrated that ECTV expressing a RING-deleted p28 has a highly attenuated phenotype in mice (4Senkevich T.G. Koonin E.V. Buller R.M. Virology. 1994; 198: 118-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), ongoing virological experiments seek to address the question of whether p28 E3 ligase activity per se is essential for ECTV virulence. If p28 E3 ligase is indeed essential for ECTV virulence, this would provide a strong argument for targeting poxvirus p28 ligase for the discovery of antivirals against smallpox. p28 is capable of catalyzing the formation of both Lys-48 and Lys-63-linked polyubiquitin chains, a unique feature found in few E3 ligases (Ref. 26Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar and references therein). The fact that p28 triggers Lys-63-linked polyubiquitylation in concert with Ubc13/Uev1A heterodimeric E2 suggests that the protein may have functions beyond mediating protein degradation (19Deng L. Wang C. Spencer E. Yang L. Braun A. You J. Slaughter C. Pickart C. Chen Z.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1513) Google Scholar, 22Spence J. Gali R.R. Dittmar G. Sherman F. Karin M. Finley D. Cell. 2000; 102: 67-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 23Galan J.M. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5847-5854Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). One possibility is that p28 may interfere with cellular antiviral mechanisms, such as immune/inflammatory responses and apoptosis, through Lys-63-linked ubiquitylation of itself or its protein substrate(s). It is of particular interest to examine whether p28-mediated Lys-63-linked ubiquitylation has any effects on the innate antiviral signaling pathways of the host, such as those activating interferons in response to viral infections. At present, the actual protein substrate(s) for p28 ligase are not known. The identification of its natural substrate(s), either viral or host, will facilitate our understanding of p28-host interactions, in particular the mechanism of p28-mediated virulence in virus infection. A growing body of evidence suggests that many viruses hijack the cellular ubiquitylation pathway to establish a successful infection (14Banks L. Pim D. Thomas M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 452-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). For example, the herpes virus immediate-early protein ICP0 is a well characterized viral ubiquitin E3 ligase that has been shown to be essential for efficient initiation of lytic infection as well as reactivation from latency in herpes virus infections. It is hypothesized that in the absence of ICP0, a host cellular mechanism suppresses viral transcription. ICP0 counteracts this process by directing the proteolytic degradation of several cellular proteins via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (27Hagglund R. Roizman B. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 2169-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Additionally, myxoma virus, a poxvirus that causes rabbit myxomatosis, encodes a membrane-bound ubiquitin ligase M153R that conjugates ubiquitin to CD4 and MHC-I molecules and down-regulates their cell surface expression, constituting a possible viral mechanism of immune evasion (28Mansouri M. Bartee E. Gouveia K. Hovey Nerenberg B.T. Barrett J. Thomas L. Thomas G. McFadden G. Fruh K. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 1427-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 29Guerin J.L. Gelfi J. Boullier S. Delverdier M. Bellanger F.A. Bertagnoli S. Drexler I. Sutter G. Messud-Petit F. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 2912-2923Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). As has been observed for p28 in ECTV infection, the M153R ligase was identified to be a myxoma virus virulence factor. An M153R deletion mutant of myxoma virus showed an attenuated phenotype in animals (28Mansouri M. Bartee E. Gouveia K. Hovey Nerenberg B.T. Barrett J. Thomas L. Thomas G. McFadden G. Fruh K. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 1427-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In the case of paramyxovirus infection, viral protein V has been shown to specifically target STATs for proteasomal degradation, thereby impairing the interferon-induced innate antiviral response (30Ulane C.M. Horvath C.M. Virology. 2002; 304: 160-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Finally, it has been reported recently that the Vif protein of the human immunodeficiency virus promotes ubiquitylation and the subsequent proteasome degradation of APOBEC3G, a cellular deaminase that confers innate resistance to retroviral infection by catalyzing the deamination of deoxycytidine to deoxyuridine in viral cDNA replication intermediates (31Sheehy A.M. Gaddis N.C. Malim M.H. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1404-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar, 32Yu X. Yu Y. Liu B. Luo K. Kong W. Mao P. Yu X.F. Science. 2003; 302: 1056-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that finding inhibitors that block a viral-specific ubiquitylation process may be an effective approach for antiviral drug development. VARV, an orthopoxvirus and the causative agent of smallpox, is a major concern because of its potential use in bioterrorism (1Harrison S.C. Alberts B. Ehrenfeld E. Enquist L. Fineberg H. McKnight S.L. Moss B. O'Donnell M. Ploegh H. Schmid S.L. Walter K.P. Theriot J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11178-11192Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Recently, sporadic cases of monkeypox infection have also drawn significant public attention (33Reed K.D. Melski J.W. Graham M.B. Regnery R.L. Sotir M.J. Wegner M.V. Kazmierczak J.J. Stratman E.J. Li Y. Fairley J.A. Swain G.R. Olson V.A. Sargent E.K. Kehl S.C. Frace M.A. Kline R. Foldy S.L. Davis J.P. Damon I.K. N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 350: 342-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). There are currently no effective antiviral therapies for these poxvirus infections. The discovery of druggable antiviral targets (e.g. essential viral enzymes) and the development of effective anti-poxvirus therapies is of increasing importance (1Harrison S.C. Alberts B. Ehrenfeld E. Enquist L. Fineberg H. McKnight S.L. Moss B. O'Donnell M. Ploegh H. Schmid S.L. Walter K.P. Theriot J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11178-11192Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The identification of poxvirus p28 as a highly effective virulence factor that possesses E3 ubiquitin ligase activity makes it an attractive viral enzyme target for anti-poxvirus drug discovery.

https://openalex.org/W2015426324,"Although cyclophilin A (CyP-A) is a relatively abundant small immunophilin present in the cytoplasm of all mammalian cells, its general function(s) in the absence of the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporin A is not known. In contrast, the high molecular weight hsp90-binding immunophilins appear to play a role in protein trafficking in that they have been shown to link glucocorticoid receptor-hsp90 and p53·hsp90 complexes to the dynein motor protein for retrograde movement along microtubules. These immunophilins link to cytoplasmic dynein indirectly through the association of the immunophilin peptidylprolyl isomerase (PPIase) domain with dynamitin, a component of the dynein-associated dynactin complex (Galigniana, M. D., Harrell, J. M., O'Hagen, H. M., Ljungman, M., and Pratt, W. B. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 22483-22489). Here, we show that CyP-A exists in native heterocomplexes containing cytoplasmic dynein that can be formed in cell-free systems. Prolyl isomerase activity is not required for forming the dynein complex, but the PPIase domain fragment of FKBP52 blocks complex formation and CyP-A binds to dynamitin in a PPIase domain-dependent manner. CyP-A heterocomplexes containing tubulin and dynein can be formed in cytosol prepared under microtubule-stabilizing conditions, and CyP-A colocalizes in mouse fibroblasts with microtubules. Colocalization with microtubules is disrupted by overexpression of the PPIase domain fragment. Thus, we conclude that CyP-A associates in vitro and in vivo with the dynein/dynactin motor protein complex and we suggest that CyP-A may perform a general function related to the binding of cargo for retrograde movement along microtubules. Although cyclophilin A (CyP-A) is a relatively abundant small immunophilin present in the cytoplasm of all mammalian cells, its general function(s) in the absence of the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporin A is not known. In contrast, the high molecular weight hsp90-binding immunophilins appear to play a role in protein trafficking in that they have been shown to link glucocorticoid receptor-hsp90 and p53·hsp90 complexes to the dynein motor protein for retrograde movement along microtubules. These immunophilins link to cytoplasmic dynein indirectly through the association of the immunophilin peptidylprolyl isomerase (PPIase) domain with dynamitin, a component of the dynein-associated dynactin complex (Galigniana, M. D., Harrell, J. M., O'Hagen, H. M., Ljungman, M., and Pratt, W. B. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 22483-22489). Here, we show that CyP-A exists in native heterocomplexes containing cytoplasmic dynein that can be formed in cell-free systems. Prolyl isomerase activity is not required for forming the dynein complex, but the PPIase domain fragment of FKBP52 blocks complex formation and CyP-A binds to dynamitin in a PPIase domain-dependent manner. CyP-A heterocomplexes containing tubulin and dynein can be formed in cytosol prepared under microtubule-stabilizing conditions, and CyP-A colocalizes in mouse fibroblasts with microtubules. Colocalization with microtubules is disrupted by overexpression of the PPIase domain fragment. Thus, we conclude that CyP-A associates in vitro and in vivo with the dynein/dynactin motor protein complex and we suggest that CyP-A may perform a general function related to the binding of cargo for retrograde movement along microtubules. The cyclophilins (CyPs) 1The abbreviations used are: CyP, cyclophilin; CyP-A, cyclophilin-A; PPIase, peptidylprolyl isomerase; FKBP, FK506-binding protein; hsp, heat shock protein; CsA, cyclosporin A; CyP-40, cyclophilin 40; TPR, tetratricopeptide repeat; GR, glucocorticoid receptor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GSH, glutathione; DIC, dynein intermediate chain; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; HISS, high ionic strength solution; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus.1The abbreviations used are: CyP, cyclophilin; CyP-A, cyclophilin-A; PPIase, peptidylprolyl isomerase; FKBP, FK506-binding protein; hsp, heat shock protein; CsA, cyclosporin A; CyP-40, cyclophilin 40; TPR, tetratricopeptide repeat; GR, glucocorticoid receptor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GSH, glutathione; DIC, dynein intermediate chain; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; HISS, high ionic strength solution; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus. are members of a large protein family called immunophilins because of their ability to bind immunosuppressant drugs (reviewed in Refs. 1Galat A. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2003; 3: 1315-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar and 2Dornan J. Taylor P. Walkinshaw M.D. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2003; 3: 1392-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The cyclophilins bind the drug cyclosporin A (CsA), and a second class of immunophilins, the FK506-binding proteins (FKBPs), binds the immunosuppressant drugs FK506 and rapamycin. The immunophilins possess peptidylprolyl isomerase (PPIase) activity, and the immunosuppressant drugs occupy the PPIase site on the immunophilin, blocking its ability to direct cistrans-isomerization of peptidylprolyl bonds in vitro. CyP-A was isolated as a 17-kDa high affinity binding protein for cyclosporin A (3Handschumacher R.E. Harding M.W. Rice J. Drugge R.J. Speicher D.W. Science. 1984; 226: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1452) Google Scholar), and it was later shown to be the same as a 17-kDa protein (4Fischer G. Wittmann-Liebold B. Lang K. Kiefhaber T. Schmid F.X. Nature. 1989; 337: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar, 5Takahashi N. Hayano T. Suzuki M. Nature. 1989; 337: 473-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar) that was known to have PPIase activity and to accelerate refolding of urea-denatured protein in vitro (6Fischer G. Bang H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 828: 39-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). CyP-A was subsequently shown to direct the immunosuppressive effect of CsA (7Liu J. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 290-295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), and the small FKBP, FKBP12, was shown to be the target for the immunosuppressive effects of FK506 and rapamycin (8Bierer B.E. Mattila P.S. Standaert R.F. Herzenberg L.A. Burakoff S.J. Crabtree G. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9231-9235Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). In both the case of CsA-bound CyP-A and that of FK506-bound FKBP12, the ultimate target of the drug-immunophilin complex is the protein phosphatase calcineurin (for review see Ref. 9Ivery M.T. Med. Res. Rev. 2000; 20: 452-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The ultimate target for rapamycin-bound FKBP12 is a phosphoinositide 3-kinase-related kinase called FRAP (FKBP-rapamycin-associated protein) (10Brown E.J. Albers M.W. Shin T.B. Ichikawa K. Keith C.T. Lane W.S. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1994; 369: 756-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (1661) Google Scholar), RAFT1 (rapamycin and FKBP12 target 1) (11Sabatini D.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Lui M. Tempst P. Snyder S.H. Cell. 1994; 78: 35-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar), or mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) (12Schmelzle T. Hall M.N. Cell. 2000; 103: 253-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar). Neither the immunosuppressant drugs nor the immunophilins CyP-A and FKBP12 bind alone to the second protein targets for immunosuppression. Only the drug-immunophilin complexes bind to calcineurin or FRAP/RAFT1/mTOR. Although most of the work on immunophilins has focused on the small CyPs and FKBPs, like CyP-A and FKBP12, high molecular weight immunophilins have been identified that contain domains for additional protein interactions or enzymatic activity as well as a PPIase domain that binds immunosuppressant drugs (2Dornan J. Taylor P. Walkinshaw M.D. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2003; 3: 1392-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Several of these high molecular weight immunophilins were discovered as components of steroid receptor-hsp90 heterocomplexes. They include CyP-40, FKBP51, and FKBP52 (reviewed in Ref. 13Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Exp. Biol. Med. 2003; 228: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1260) Google Scholar), and they are not involved in the immunosuppressant actions of CsA or FK506. These immunophilins possess tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains that bind to a TPR acceptor site located in the C terminus of the abundant and ubiquitous protein chaperone hsp90. Two roles have been proposed for these hsp90-binding immunophilins in steroid receptor action. Riggs et al. (14Riggs D.L. Roberts P.J. Chirillo S.C. Cheung-Flynn J. Prapapanich V. Ratajczak T. Gaber R. Picard D. Smith D.F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1158-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) have shown that FKBP52 selectively potentiates glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-dependent reporter gene activation by increasing the hormone-binding affinity of the receptor. This effect requires the prolyl isomerase activity of FKBP52 and is blocked by FK506. Another line of research has focused on the role of hsp90-binding immunophilins in targeting the movement of the GR to the nucleus (reviewed in Ref. 15Pratt W.B. Galigniana M.D. Harrell J.M. DeFranco D.B. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 857-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The action of these immunophilins in receptor movement is not affected by the presence of immunosuppressant drugs and thus does not require prolyl isomerase activity. In addition to TPR domain immunophilins, GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes immunoadsorbed from cell lysates contain cytoplasmic dynein (16Galigniana M.D. Radanyi C. Renoir J.M. Housley P.R. Pratt W.B. J.

Gee M.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 490-494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In these complexes, the PPIase domain of the immunophilin functions as a protein-protein-binding domain to link the GR·hsp90 unit to the protein motor (19Silverstein A.M.

Radanyi C. Renoir J.M. Zhang M. Pratt W.B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13602-13610Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The immunophilin linkage to cytoplasmic dynein is indirect by means of the dynamitin component of the dynein-associated dynactin complex (22Galigniana M.D. Harrell J.M. O'Hagen H.M. Ljungman M. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22483-22489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The binding of CyP-40 or FKBP52 to dynein is competed by a purified PPIase domain fragment of FKBP52 (21Galigniana M.D. Harrell J.M. Murphy P.J. Chinkers M. Radanyi C. Renoir J.M. Zhang M. Pratt W.B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13602-13610Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and purified FKBP52 has been shown to bind directly via its PPIase domain to immunopurified dynamitin (22Galigniana M.D. Harrell J.M. O'Hagen H.M. Ljungman M. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22483-22489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). There is a high degree of similarity in PPIase domain structure among the various cyclophilins (2Dornan J. Taylor P. Walkinshaw M.D. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2003; 3: 1392-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The PPIase domain of bovine CyP-40, for example, shares 61% identity with the sequence of human CyP-A,and with one exception, the active site residues are identical (2Dornan J. Taylor P. Walkinshaw M.D. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2003; 3: 1392-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Thus, we have asked whether CyP-A, like as its high molecular weight hsp90-binding homolog CyP-40, binds through its PPIase domain to the dynein/dynactin complex. Here we show that immunoadsorption of CyP-A from reticulocyte lysate or L cell cytosol yields coimmunoadsorption of cytoplasmic dynein. The linkage to dynein is indirect via the dynamitin component of the dynein-associated dynactin complex, and CyP-A binds to dynamitin in a manner that is competed by a purified PPIase domain fragment of FKBP52. Immunoprecipitation of CyP-A from cytosol containing paclitaxel and GTP to stabilize microtubules yields the coprecipitation of tubulin and dynein in a PPIase domain-dependent manner, and Cyp-A colocalizes with microtubules in NIH 3T3 cells. The observation that CyP-A is associated with the microtubule-based dynein/dynactin motor protein complex should be useful in eventually defining the housekeeping function(s) of this single domain immunophilin in mammalian cells in the absence of immunosuppressant drugs.

The myc-tagged pCMVH50m construct encoding for p50/dynamitin (25Burkhardt J.K. Echeverri C.J. Nilsson T. Vallee R.B. J.

All of the incubation buffers used in these studies were supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 tablet of Complete Mini Plus 1000 units of hirudin/2 ml of buffer). Coimmunoadsorption of Endogenous CyP-A and Dynein—50 μl of reticulocyte lysate were immunoadsorbed to 16 μl of protein A-Sepharose with either 5 μl of rabbit antiserum against CyP-A or 5 μl of mouse IgG against dynein intermediate chain. After 2 h at 4 °C, the pellets were washed with TEGM buffer (10 mm TES at pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 10% v/v glycerol, and 20 mm Na2MoO4). Proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, electrotransferred to an Immobilon P membrane, and Western blotted. Formation of Complexes with GSH-Agarose-immobilized GST-CyP A—80 μl of GSH-agarose in 80 μl of TEG buffer (TEGM buffer without molybdate) were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with 10 μl of cytosol from BL21 E. coli overexpressing either human GST or human GST-CyP-A. The pellets were washed and reincubated for two additional hours in TEG buffer supplemented with 0.5 m NaCl and 0.05% Nonidet P-40 and washed three times with TEG buffer and twice with 10 mm Hepes at pH 7.5. The washed pellets containing immobilized GST-CyP-A (or GST alone) were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with 50 μl of reticulocyte lysate supplemented with protease inhibitors, 5 μl of an ATP-regeneration system (50 mm ATP, 250 mm creatine phosphate, 20 mm magnesium acetate, and 100 units/ml creatine phosphokinase), and the indicated peptides in HKD buffer (10 mm Hepes at pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, and 2 mm dithiothreitol). Binding of CyP-A to Dynamitin—L929 mouse fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum and antibiotics. When the cells were 50% confluent, the medium was replaced by Opti-MEM I transfection medium and the incubation continued for 1 h. The medium was aspirated and replaced by a transfection mixture (at a 3-μl liposome/μg DNA ratio) preincubated for 15 min at room temperature in Opti-MEM I, which contained 3 μg of the myc-tagged pCMVH50m plasmid encoding for p50/dynamitin. After 1.5 h of transfection, the mixture was replaced by regular medium. After 36 h, the cells were harvested and ruptured by Dounce homogenization in HE buffer (10 mm Hepes at pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. Cell cytosol (250 μl) was rotated for 2 h at 4 °C with 16 μl of protein A-Sepharose and 10 μl of anti-myc antibody. The supernatant was aspirated, and the pellet was stripped of coimmunoadsorbed proteins by preincubation with buffer supplemented with 0.5 m NaCl and 0.05% Nonidet P-40. After 2 h, the samples were washed three times with TEG buffer and twice with HE buffer. The pellets were incubated on ice with 10 μl of bacterial lysate overexpressing GST-CyP-A in the presence or absence of 90 μg of purified PPIase domain from FKBP52. The final volume was adjusted to 50 μl with HKD buffer. After 1 h, the pellets were washed with TEGM buffer and the proteins were resolved by electrophoresis followed by Western blotting. Microtubule-stabilized Preparations—L929 fibroblasts were incubated for 15 min with 20 μm paclitaxel prior to rupture by Dounce homogenization in MES buffer (0.1 m Mes, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm MgCl2, pH 6.9) supplemented with 20 μm paclitaxel, 100 μm GTP, and protease inhibitors. Prior to adsorption, 0.05% Nonidet P-40 was added to the cytosol and it was rotated for 30 min at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 30 p.s.i. for 15 min in an Airfuge. Aliquots (250 μl) of cytosol were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min with 25 μl of lysate from nonexpressing bacteria and 50 μl of HKD buffer or 25 μl of lysate from bacteria overexpressing GST-CyP-A and 50 μl of HKD buffer or 25 μl of lysate from bacteria overexpressing GST-CyP-A and 325 μg of purified PPIase domain of FKBP52 in HKD buffer. The HKD buffer also contained protease inhibitors. GST-CyP-A was then immobilized by rotation with GSH-agarose for 2 h at 4 °C. The pellets were washed with TEGM buffer, and the proteins were resolved by immunoblotting Immunoblotting—Immune pellets were resolved on SDS-10% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon P membranes. The membranes were probed with 0.1% MAB1618 for dynein intermediate chain, 0.1% A-14 for myc-dynamitin, 0.05% rabbit antiserum for CyP-A, and 0.05% mouse IgG for GST. Indirect Immunofluorescence—NIH 3T3 cells were grown on 11 × 22-mm coverslips coated with fibrinogen in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum and antibiotics. The coverslips were rinsed with phosphate-saline solution and fixed for 4 h in a freshly prepared 4% p-formaldehyde solution in phosphate-saline buffer. Cells were permeabilized by immersing the coverslips in acetone at -20 °C for 15 min. After washing the coverslips with phosphate-saline buffer, they were preincubated for 1 h at room temperature in HISS (high ionic strength solution) buffer (20 mm Tris at pH 8.0, 0.63 m NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and 3.5% bovine serum albumin) supplemented with 1% horse serum. The cells were washed in HISS buffer and immunostained by inverting the coverslips on a 50-μl solution of HISS buffer containing 1 μl of rat anti-α-tubulin and 0.2 μl of rabbit anti-CyP-A serum. After 2 h at room temperature in a humid chamber, the cells were washed in HISS buffer for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with a 1/100 dilution of the corresponding counter-antibodies (rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rat IgG). The coverslips were mounted on microscope slides using a drop of Antifade mounting medium (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands), and the cells were observed with an Olympus Fluo-view-500 confocal microscope. CyP-A Is Recovered in Native Heterocomplex with Dynein—To determine whether CyP-A exists in native heterocomplexes with dynein, reticulocyte lysate was immunoadsorbed with antibodies directed against the immunophilin or against the intermediate chain of dynein and proteins associated with the washed immune pellets were detected by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 1A, immunoadsorption of dynein yielded coadsorption of CyP-A (lane 3) and immunoadsorption of CyP-A yielded coadsorption of dynein (lane 5), consistent with the notion that CyP-A exists in native heterocomplexes with cytoplasmic dynein. In Fig. 1, lanes 6-9, the entire lanes for each immunopellet were blotted with each antibody to demonstrate the specificity of the interaction. To show that the complex does not involve only small amounts of either protein, a large amount of CyP-A was immunoadsorbed from reticulocyte lysate and the resulting immunodepletion of dynein was assessed. As shown in Fig. 1B, increasing immunoadsorption of CyP-A was accompanied by increasing coadsorption of dynein (lanes 3 and 4). At the higher amount of antibody, most of the CyP-A and a substantial amount of the dynein were adsorbed from reticulocyte lysate (cf. lane 7 with lane 5). By scanning the lanes with a PhosphorImager and subtracting an adjacent background value, arbitrary units for each protein remaining in nonimmune (lane 5) and the highest immune (lane 7) supernatant were determined. A depletion of 75% CyP-A yielded 59% codepletion of dynein, indicating that a majority of each protein is in a heterocomplex containing the other protein. To show that the binding is not a weak and possibly nonspecific interaction, reticulocyte lysate was immunoadsorbed with anti-CyP-A and the immune pellets were washed under increasingly harsh conditions. As shown in Fig. 1C, the complex of CyP-A with dynein persisted upon washing with TEG buffer plus 100 mm NaCl (cf. lanes 2 and 3) and washing with TEG plus NaCl and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (lane 3). Washing under very harsh detergent conditions (NaCl, Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate) dissociates the CyP-A antibody from the protein A-Sepharose pellet such that most of the CyP-A and dynein are lost. Nevertheless, some complex of CyP-A and dynein can be seen under these very harsh conditions of washing (lane 5). We have previously used reticulocyte lysate to achieve cell-free assembly of GR·hsp90 complexes that contain hsp90-binding immunophilins and dynein (16Galigniana M.D. Radanyi C. Renoir J.M. Housley P.R. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14884-14889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In the experiment of Fig. 2, GST-CyP-A was immobilized onto glutathione beads and the beads were incubated with reticulocyte lysate under the same GR heterocomplex assembly conditions. Glutathione beads bound with GST alone did not contain dynein after incubation with reticulocyte lysate (lane 2), but GST-CyP-A-bound beads contained dynein (lane 5). CyP-A PPIase Domain Is Required for Complex with Dynein—The formation of heterocomplexes containing the hsp90-binding immunophilins and dynein requires the PPIase domain of the immunophilin and can be blocked by competition with the PPIase domain fragment of FKBP52 (16Galigniana M.D. Radanyi C.

Pratt W.B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13602-13610Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In the experiment of Fig. 3, GST-CyP-A-bound beads were incubated with reticulocyte lysate in the presence of lysate from bacteria expressing the FKBP52 PPIase domain fragment and the beads were then washed and assayed for bound proteins. The presence of the PPIase domain fragment prevented CyP-A association with dynein (cf. lanes 2 and 4), whereas the presence of a TPR domain fragment did not affect dynein binding (lane 5). We have shown previously that the TPR domain fragment inhibits the binding of TPR domain immunophilins to hsp90 but does not affect their binding to dynein (16Galigniana M.D. Radanyi C. Renoir J.M. Housley P.R. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14884-14889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Importantly, CsA does not affect the formation of a CyP-A complex with dynein (lane 6), suggesting that prolyl isomerase activity is not required. CyP-A Interaction with Dynamitin—Recently, we have demonstrated that purified FKBP52 binds directly to purified myc-dynamitin, a 50-kDa component of the dynein-associated dynactin complex (22Galigniana M.D. Harrell J.M. O'Hagen H.M. Ljungman M. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22483-22489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In Fig. 4, anti-myc antibody was used to immunoadsorb cytosol from cells overexpressing myc-dynamitin and the salt-stripped immune pellet was incubated with lysate from bacteria expressing GST-CyP-A. The GST-CyP-A bound to myc-dynamitin (condition 2), and the binding was blocked by the PPIase fragment of FKBP52 (condition 3). Thus, similar to the hsp90-binding immunophilins, CyP-A appears to associate with dynein indirectly by binding to dynamitin. Tubulin Is Present in the CyP-A Heterocomplexes—We have recently shown that GR heterocomplexes immunoadsorbed from L cell cytosol prepared with a microtubule-stabilizing buffer contain tubulin as well as dynein. 2J. M. Harrell, M. D. Galigniana, P. J. M. Murphy, Y. Morishima, and W. B. Pratt, manuscript in preparation. In the experiment of Fig. 5, L cells were treated briefly with paclitaxel and then ruptured in buffer containing both paclitaxel and GTP to stabilize microtubules. Cytosol was also prepared without the microtubule-stabilizing conditions. Lysate from bacteria expressing GST-CyP-A was added to each cytosol preparation, the mixture was incubated, and the GST-CyP-A was adsorbed to glutathione beads. As shown in Fig. 5, condition 2, dynein is present in GST-CyP-A pellets prepared under either condition but tubulin is present only when GST-CyP-A is adsorbed from cytosol prepared under microtubule-stabilizing conditions. If the PPIase domain fragment is present to compete for CyP-A binding to dynamitin, neither dynein nor tubulin is present in the GST-CyP-A pellet (condition 3). This finding supports a model in which CyP-A is linked to microtubules via its association with the dynein/dynactin complex. CyP-A Is Localized to Microtubules in Vivo—In Fig. 6, 3T3 mouse fibroblasts were cotransfected with plasmids encoding for the PPIase domain fragment of FKBP52 and cyanine fluorescent protein. After 36 h, the cells were fixed and immunostained for tubulin (Fig. 6A, green) and CyP-A (Fig. 6B, red). In the untransfected cells, CyP-A is seen to colocalize with tubulin (see merge in Fig. 6C). The blue image in Fig. 6D shows a cotransfected cell in the middle of the field. The expression of the PPIase domain fragment did not affect the fibrillar pattern of the microtubules (Fig. 6A), but it disrupted the fibrillar distribution of CyP-A (Fig. 6B). This is consistent with the PPIase domain fragment competing for the localization of CyP-A to microtubules. Here, we have shown that the single domain immunophilin, CyP-A, behaves like the hsp90-binding TPR domain immunophilins in binding to the cytoplasmic dynein motor protein complex (Fig. 1). The PPIase domain fragment of FKBP52 competes for dynein binding; however, inasmuch as binding occurs in the presence or absence CsA (Fig. 3), the isomerase activity of CyP-A is not required. Thus, the binding of immunophilin PPIase domains to the motor protein complex is very different from the binding of CyP-A or FKBP12 to calcineurin where only the CsA- or FK506-bound immunophilin is a calcineurin binding partner. Again, like the hsp90-binding immunophilins, CyP-A appears to bind to dynein indirectly through an interaction of its PPIase domain with the dynamitin component of the dynein-associated dynactin complex (Fig. 4). Cytoplasmic dynein motors process along microtubules tracks, and we show that CyP-A heterocomplexes containing tubulin and dynein can be formed in cytosol under microtubule-stabilizing conditions (Fig. 5). Importantly, we show that CyP-A colocalizes with microtubules in 3T3 mouse fibroblasts and that binding to microtubules in vivo is disrupted by overexpression of the PPIase domain fragment of FKBP52 (Fig. 6). Taken together, the in vitro and in vivo observations support a model in which CyP-A is associated with the retrograde movement system as a CyP-A-dynamitin-dynein-microtubule complex. CyP-A is present as a relatively abundant protein in the cytoplasm of all mammalian cells (2Dornan J. Taylor P. Walkinshaw M.D. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2003; 3: 1392-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Thus, it must perform some general housekeeping function(s) important for cellular homeostasis. To date, the studies of CyP-A have largely focused on its structure and its immunosuppressive action through the association of the CyP-A·CsA complex with calcineurin (1Galat A. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2003; 3: 1315-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 2Dornan J. Taylor P. Walkinshaw M.D. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2003; 3: 1392-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Occasional reports have noted the CyP-A association with specific proteins, such as the YY1 suppressor of gene transcription (27Yang W.M. Inouye C.J. Seto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15187-15193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 Pr55gag polyprotein precursor (26Luban J. Bossolt K.L.

Biol. 1997; 269: 780-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). However, the associations reported have not led to a general model for CyP-A function in mammalian cells in the absence of CsA. The association of CyP-A with the dynein/dynactin motor protein complex could reveal a general housekeeping function. Dynein is thought to link to its cargo indirectly through dynactin, but it is not known how cargo is recognized (29Hirokawa N. Science. 1998; 279: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). We summarized in the Introduction how the TPR domain immunophilins target two hsp90-regulated proteins, the GR and p53, to the dynein/dynactin complex for their retrograde movement to the nucleus (15Pratt W.B. Galigniana M.D. Harrell J.M. DeFranco D.B. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 857-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). CyP-A could participate in such cargo recognition either directly or indirectly as part of a protein complex. Interestingly, there are several lines of evidence suggesting that HIV uses dynein and the microtubule network to transport its genome to the nucleus. Because HIV requires CyP-A to efficiently replicate in human cells (30Franke E.K. Yuan H.E Luban J. Nature. 1994; 372: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 31Thali M. Bukovsky A. Kondo E. Rosenwirth B. Walsh C.T. Sodroski J. Gottlinger H.G. Nature. 1994; 372: 363-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar), one can envision that CyP-A acts as connector between HIV and the microtubule network in order to facilitate a secured convey of the viral genome to the nucleus.

Although HsTx1 belongs to the same α-KTx6 family, it exhibits a pharmacological profile opposite to MTX. Indeed, it has been reported that HsTx1 does not compete with 125I-apamin for binding onto SK channels from rat brain synaptosomes, whereas it potently blocks Kv1.3 channels (5Lebrun B. Romi-Lebrun R. Martin-Eauclaire M.F. Yasuda A. Ishiguro M. Oyama Y. Pongs O. Nakajima T. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In this report, we have shown for the first time that HsTx1 is highly potent on Kv1.1, whereas it mildly blocks IK channels and is inactive on Kv1.2 channels. The three-dimensional solution structures of both MTX (13Blanc E. Sabatier J.M. Kharrat R. Meunier S. El Ayeb M. Van Rietschoten J. Darbon H. Proteins. 1997; 29: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and HsTx1 (6Savarin P. Romi-Lebrun R. Zin-Justin S. Lebrun B. Nakajima T. Gilquin B. Ménez A. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2672-2685Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) have been solved by 1H NMR. The two toxins are folded according to an α/β architectural motif (14Bontems F. Roumestand C. Gilquin B. Ménez A. Toma F. Science. 1991; 254 (12): 1521-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 15Mouhat S. Jouirou B. Mosbah A. De Waard M. Sabatier J.M. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) that consists of an N-terminal helical structure connected to a C-terminal two-stranded antiparallel β-sheet by two of the four disulfide bridges. In the case of MTX, the bended helical structure extends from residues 6 to 16, whereas the two β-strands extend from residues 23 to 26 and 28 to 31 (13Blanc E. Sabatier J.M. Kharrat R. Meunier S. El Ayeb M. Van Rietschoten J. Darbon H. Proteins. 1997; 29: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In the case of HsTx1, the helical structure runs from residues 6 to 16, whereas the β-hairpin encompasses residues 22 to 31 (6Savarin P. Romi-Lebrun R. Zin-Justin S. Lebrun B. Nakajima T. Gilquin B. Ménez A. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2672-2685Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), which is a three-dimensional structure similar to that of MTX. Because minimal structural differences are observed between the two toxins, pharmacological variations between both should conceivably be associated with changes in amino acid sequence (59% sequence identity). Marked differences in the pharmacology of scorpion toxins have been mostly attributed to changes in amino acid sequence, especially within the helical or β-sheet regions. In that respect, the choice of MTX and HsTx1 appears ideal to produce a chimera toxin because both peptides belong to the same structural family, are of similar length, possess four disulfide bridges, and share the same global fold but display divergent channel targets. Using MTX and HsTx1 as molecular templates, we examined for the first time the actual contribution of the helical and β-sheet regions to toxin pharmacology. A MTX-HsTx1 chimera toxin was chemically produced that contains the N-terminal helical region of MTX (sequence 1-16) and the C-terminal β-sheet region of HsTx1 (sequence 17-34) (Fig. 1a). Using the 1H NMR technique, we have demonstrated that MTX-HsTx1 folds, as expected, along the α/β scaffold. Interestingly, the chimera peptide displays MTX- or HsTx1-like pharmacological properties depending on the nature of the channel target that helps refine the contribution of the helical and β-sheet regions to toxin pharmacology. N-α-Fmoc-l-amino acids, Fmoc-amide resin, and reagents used for peptide synthesis were purchased from Applied Biosystems. Analytical grade solvents were obtained from SDS. Trypsin and chymotrypsin were from Roche Applied Science. The chemical syntheses of MTX and HsTx1 have been described elsewhere (2Kharrat R. Mabrouk K. Crest M. Darbon H. Oughideni R. Martin-Eauclaire M.F. Jacquet G. El Ayeb M. Van Rietschoten J. Sabatier J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 5Lebrun B. Romi-Lebrun R. Martin-Eauclaire M.F. Yasuda A. Ishiguro M. Oyama Y. Pongs O. Nakajima T. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). For the production of HsTx1, we used a strategy of synthesis similar to that of MTX (2Kharrat R. Mabrouk K. Crest M. Darbon H. Oughideni R. Martin-Eauclaire M.F. Jacquet G. El Ayeb M. Van Rietschoten J. Sabatier J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The MTX-HsTx1 chimera was assembled by the solid phase technique (16Merrifield R.B. Science. 1986; 232: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar) using a peptide synthesizer (Model 433A; Applied Biosystems Inc.). The peptide chains were assembled stepwise on 0.3 mmol equivalent of Fmoc-amide resin (0.68 mmol equivalent of amino group/g) using 1 mmol of Nα-(9-fluorenyl)methyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc) amino acid derivatives. The side chain-protecting groups used for trifunctional residues were: trityl for Cys, Asn, and Gln; tert-butyl for Glu, Ser, Tyr, Thr, and Asp; pentamethylchroman for Arg; and tert-butyloxycarbonyl for Lys. The Fmoc-amino acid derivatives were coupled (20 min) as their hydroxybenzotriazole active esters in N-methylpyrrolidone (3.3-fold excess). The fully protected peptide resins (∼2.3 g) were treated for 2.5 h at 25 °C with a mixture of trifluoroacetic acid/H2O/thioanisole/ethanedithiol (73/11/11/5, v/v) in the presence of crystalline phenol (2.3 g). The crude peptides were precipitated and washed by adding cold diethyloxide. The crude peptides were pelleted by centrifugation (3,000 × g, 10 min), and the supernatants were discarded. The reduced peptides were then dissolved at 2 mm concentration in 0.2 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.3, and stirred under air to allow oxidative folding (72 h, 22 °C). The folded/oxidized peptides were purified by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) (C18 Aquapore ODS, 20 μm, 250 × 10 mm; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by means of a 60-min linear gradient of 0.08% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid/0 to 30% acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid/H2O at a flow rate of 6 ml/min (λ = 230 nm). The homogeneity and identity of each peptide were assessed by: (i) analytical C18 reversed-phase HPLC; (ii) amino acid analysis after acidolysis, (iii) mass determination by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry, and (iv) enzyme-based cleavage to establish half-cystine pairs. MTX-HsTx1 (600 μg) was incubated with a mixture of trypsin and chymotrypsin (60 μg of each enzyme) in 0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, for 12 h at 37 °C. The peptide fragments were then separated by reversed-phase HPLC (Chromolith RP18, 5 μm, 4.6 × 100 mm) with a 60-min linear gradient of 0.08% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid/0% to 60% acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid/H2O at a flow rate of 1 ml/min (λ = 230 nm) and lyophilized before analysis. The peptides were hydrolyzed by acidolysis (6 N HCl with 2% (w/v) phenol, 20 h at 120 °C under N2 atmosphere), and their amino acid contents were analyzed (System 6300 amino acid analyzer; Beckman). The fragments were further characterized by mass spectrometry analysis (RP-DE Voyager; Perseptive Biosystems) and Edman sequencing using a gas-phase microsequencer (Applied Biosystems 470A). The diPTH-cystine elutes at a retention time of 9.8 min in standard HPLC conditions for analysis of the phenylthiohydantoin amino acid derivatives. 1H NMR Spectroscopy—MTX-HsTx1 (5 mg) was dissolved in 0.5 ml of water/D2O (90/10, v/v), pH 3.0, uncorrected for isotope effects. The amide proton exchange rate was assessed after lyophilization and solubilization in 100% D2O. All 1H NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker DRX500 spectrometer equipped with a proton/carbon/nitrogen probe and self-shielded triple axis gradients. Two-dimensional spectra were acquired using the states-time proportional phase increment method to achieve F1 quadrature detection (17Marion D. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 113: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (3524) Google Scholar). Water suppression was obtained either using presaturation during the 1.3-s relaxation delay and during the mixing time for NOE spectroscopy spectra or with a watergate 3-9-19 pulse train (18Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3527) Google Scholar) using a gradient at the magic angle obtained by applying simultaneous x-, y-, and z-gradients prior to detection. A series of spectra were recorded at a temperature of 290 K and lacked signal overlaps. One double quantum-filtered correlation spectroscopy (19Piantini U. Sorensen O.W. Ernst R.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 6800-6801Crossref Scopus (1887) Google Scholar) spectrum was recorded at 290 K for spin system identification. One total correlation spectroscopy (20Griesinger C. Otting G. Wüthrich K. Ernst R.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 7870-7872Crossref Scopus (1196) Google Scholar) spectrum with a spin lock value of 80 ms was recorded at 290 K, and two NOE spectroscopy (21Kumar A. Ernst R.R. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1981; 95: 1-6Crossref Scopus (2030) Google Scholar) spectra were recorded with mixing time values of 80 and 150 ms at 290 K. Data Processing—Spectra were processed using UXNMR on a Silicon Graphics OCTANE R10000 work station. The matrices were transformed to a final size of 2,048 points in the acquisition dimension and to 1,024 points in the other. A shifted sine-bell window in both dimensions prior to Fourier transform multiplied the signal, and thereafter a fifth-order polynomial baseline correction was applied. Proton chemical shifts were calibrated relative to water at 290 K at 4.85 ppm. Spectra analysis was performed using the XEASY software (22Bartels C. Xia T.H. Billeter M. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar). Sequential Assignment—Amino acid spin system identification and sequential assignment were performed by using the standard strategy of Wüthrich (23Wüthrich K. Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley and Sons, New York1986: 117-176Google Scholar). The three-dimensional solution structure of MTX-HsTx1 was solved by using the 1H NMR technique. The spin systems of MTX-HsTx1 were identified from both COSY and total correlation spectroscopy spectra. NOE spectroscopy spectra were used to perform the sequential assignment. Experimental Restraints and Structure Calculation—The integration of NOE data was performed using the manual integration mode of XEASY for NOE spectroscopy spectra. Distance geometry calculations were performed with the variable function software DIANA 2.8 (24Güntert P. Braun W. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1991; 1: 111-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). A preliminary set of 1,000 structures was initiated including only intra-residual and sequential upper limit distances that were converted from peak volumes using the CALIBA routine of the DIANA package. From the first set of calculated structures, the 500 best were kept for a second round, including medium-range upper limit distances, and the remaining 250 best for a third one, with the whole set of upper limit restraints. Finally, three runs of the REDAC (redundant dihedral angle constraints) strategy were performed on the 100 best structures, and the final 20 best structures were minimized under NMR restraints using the crystallography NMR software minimization routine (25Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The hydrogen bond restraints were obtained by measuring the exchange rate of amide protons, and the partners were assigned using both DIANA possible hydrogen bond listing output and distance measurement on structures obtained with only NOE input. The values of α-torsion angle constraints were obtained via coupling constant measurement on the double quantum-filtered correlation spectroscopy spectrum transformed with a final size of 8,192/1,024 points. The 3JHN-Hα coupling constant was translated into -40°/-70° and -70°/170° angle restraints corresponding, respectively, to small (<7 Hz) and large (>8 Hz) coupling constants. The visual analysis of the quality of the peptide structures was done using the TURBO software (26Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Geometry Partner Directory. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1989: 77-78Google Scholar). Quantitative analysis was performed with PROCHECK NMR (27Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4430) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of MTX-HsTx1 is deposited at the Protein Data Bank (accession code 1WPD). The assigned chemical shifts of the chimera are deposited at the BioMagResBank (BMRB accession number 6347). The electrostatic potential and dipole moment of the peptide were calculated using GRASP software (28Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5316) Google Scholar) running on a Silicon Graphics work station. This calculation includes all ionizable groups in the peptide, based on the Amber force field of the residues. The potential maps were calculated with a simplified Poisson-Boltzmann solver (29Nicholls A. Honig B. J. Comput. Chem. 1991; 12: 435-445Crossref Scopus (1169) Google Scholar). Rat brain synaptosomes were prepared as described by Gray and Whittaker (30Gray E.G. Whittaker V.P. J. Anat. 1962; 96: 79-88PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots of 50 μl of 0.1 nm125I-apamin were added to 400 μl of synaptosome suspension (0.4 mg protein/ml). Samples were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 50 μl of a series of MTX-HsTx1 concentrations in 500-μl final volume (final MTX-HsTx1 concentrations of 10-6-10-13m). The incubation buffer was 25 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm KCl, pH 7.2. The samples were centrifuged, and the resulting pellets were washed three times in 1 ml of the same buffer. Bound radioactivity was determined by γ counting (Packard Crystal II). The values expressed are the means of triplicate experiments ± S.D. Nonspecific binding, less than 10% of the total binding, was determined in the presence of an excess (10 nm) of unlabeled apamin. L929, B82, and MEL cells stably expressing mouse Kv1.1, rat Kv1.2, and mouse Kv1.3 channels have been described previously (31Grissmer S. Nguyen A.N. Aiyar J. Hanson D.C. Mather R.J. Gutman G.A.

Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 1227-1234PubMed Google Scholar) and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 4 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 500 μg/ml G418 (Calbiochem). HEK-293 cells expressing hSlo α (BK) channels were from Dr. A. Tinker (Centre for Clinical Pharmacology, University College London). The human IKCa1 (IK) channel was transiently transfected into COS-7 cells using FuGENE™ 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were studied in the whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp technique. The holding potential was -80 mV in all experiments. For measuring IK and BK currents, we used an internal pipette solution containing (in mm): 145 potassium aspartate, 2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 10 EGTA (potassium salt), and 8.5 CaCl2 (1 μm free Ca2+), pH 7.2, 290-310 mosm. To reduce currents from the native chloride channels, sodium aspartate Ringer was used as an external solution (in mm): 160 sodium aspartate, 4.5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 5 HEPES, pH 7.4, 290-310 mosm. IK currents were elicited by 200-ms voltage ramps from -120 mV to +40 mV applied every 10 s. The BK currents were elicited by 200-ms voltage ramps from -80 to +80 mV applied every 30 s. The Kv1.1, Kv1.2, and Kv1.3 currents were recorded in normal Ringer solution with a calcium-free pipette solution containing (in mm): 145 KF, 10 HEPES, 10 EGTA, 2 MgCl2, pH 7.2, 300 mosm as previously described (31Grissmer S. Nguyen A.N. Aiyar J. Hanson D.C. Mather R.J. Gutman G.A. Karmilowicz M.J. Auperin A.A. Chandy K.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 1227-1234PubMed Google Scholar). Chemical Synthesis and Characterization of MTX-HsTx1—Solid-phase stepwise assembly of MTX-HsTx1 was achieved by means of Fmoc/tert-butyl chemistry (16Merrifield R.B. Science. 1986; 232: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). The yield of assembly was about 75%. The C18 reversed-phase HPLC elution profiles of MTX-HsTx1 are shown at different stages of its synthesis (Fig. 1b). The amino acid analysis of purified folded/oxidized MTX-HsTx1 gave amino acid ratios that are in agreement with the deduced values (data not shown). MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis provides an experimental Mr (M+H)+ value of 3786.0, which is close to the deduced theoretical Mr (M+H)+ value of 3785.5. MTX-HsTx1 was cleaved by treatment with enzymes demonstrating that it exhibits a conventional disulfide bridging of the type C1-C5, C2-C6, C3-C7 and C4-C8 (Cys3-Cys24, Cys9-Cys29, Cys13-Cys31, and Cys19-Cys34) (Fig. 1c). Three-dimensional Structure of MTX-HsTx1 in Solution as Determined by 1H NMR—Fig. 2 illustrates the determination of the three-dimensional solution structure of MTX-HsTx1 by 1H NMR. We measured 214 NOE-derived restraints (66 intra-residual, 91 sequential, 25 medium range, and 32 long range). The exchange rates of amide protons with the solvent (D2O) were measured. Amide protons that were still present after 30 h of exchange were considered as being involved in hydrogen bonds (we used 14 restraints from the hydrogen bonds). Most of the slowly exchanged amide protons occurred in regular secondary structures. We manually measured 15 3JHN-Hα coupling constants on the double quantum-filtered correlation spectroscopy spectrum. The sequential and medium range NOE correlations, the comparison of the structures of related toxins, and the coupling constant values were used to define the secondary structures (Fig. 2a). The presence of strong sequential HN-HNI+1 NOEs, together with typical Hα-HNi+3 and Hα-HNi+4 connectivities, was observed from residues 9 to 16, in addition to small 3JHN-Hα coupling constants. This corresponds to an α-helix, which indicates that the helical structure of MTX is conserved when transferred into MTX-HsTx1. Strong Hα-HNi+1, together with weak or lacking HN-HNI+1 connectivities, and large 3JHN-Hα coupling constants have been measured on residues 22-25 and 28-31, indicating an extended conformation. A HN-HNI+3 was found between Met25 and Lys28, coupled with HN-HNI+1 connectivities between Asn26 and Arg27. This corresponds to a β-turn type of secondary structure. The 25 calculated structures of MTX-HsTx1 were in good agreement with the experimental data, because neither distance violation >0.3 Å nor angle violation >10° could be observed. These structures were then energy-minimized by the algorithm of the crystallography NMR 1.0 software to suppress the undesired non-bonded contacts. This step led to a family of 20 final structures still consistent with experimental restraints as there was no NOE violation larger than 0.2 Å and no angle violation larger than 5° (Fig. 2b). The covalent geometry was convenient as indicated by the low root mean square deviation values on the bond lengths and valence angles. The 20 structures formed a unique family with a root mean square deviation of 0.90 ± 0.24 Å for the backbone and 1.39 ± 0.24 Å for all the heavy atoms. The 20 structures share the same global fold, with a low root mean square deviation all over the structure, except the N terminus where the lack of restraints increases the root mean square deviation value. Overall, these 1H NMR data indicate that the β-sheet region of HsTx1 has been adequately transferred into MTX-HsTx1. The addition of the helical region of MTX with the β-sheet region of HsTx1 provides a toxin-like peptide that is well folded and oxidized along the α/β scaffold (Fig. 2c). In addition, the chimera possesses the characteristic charge anisotropy (32Darbon H. Blanc E. Sabatier J.M. Darbon H. Sabatier J.M. Perspectives in Drug Discovery and Design: Animal Toxins and Potassium Channels. 15/16. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1999: 41-60Google Scholar) also found in MTX and HsTx1 (Fig. 2d). The proper folding and oxidation of MTX-HsTx1 suggest that it should possess a pharmacological activity onto K+ channels. We thus compared on a systematic basis the pharmacological profile of MTX-HsTx1 with those of MTX and HsTx1 scorpion toxins. Inhibition of 125I-Apamin Binding onto SK Channels from Rat Brain Synaptosomes—We first tested the ability of MTX-HsTx1, MTX, or HsTx1 to compete with 125I-apamin binding onto SK channels from rat brain synaptosomes (Fig. 3). MTX-HsTx1 inhibits 125I-apamin binding with an IC50 value of 1.7 ± 0.2 nm. This is similar to the binding inhibition observed by MTX (IC50 value of 1.2 ± 0.2 nm, a value that itself agrees with previous data (2Kharrat R. Mabrouk K. Crest M. Darbon H. Oughideni R.

In contrast, HsTx1 was fully inactive, as previously reported (5Lebrun B. Romi-Lebrun R. Martin-Eauclaire M.F. Yasuda A. Ishiguro M. Oyama Y. Pongs O. Nakajima T. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These data demonstrate that MTX-HsTx1 adopts the pharmacological behavior of MTX for apamin-sensitive SK channels and highlight the importance of the toxin helical region in conferring this property. This role of the helical region in SK channel recognition was suspected from earlier structure-activity relationship studies using point-mutated analogues of toxins active on SK channels (34Sabatier J.M.

Inhibition of K+Currents by MTX-HsTx1 and Comparison with the Blocking Efficacies of MTX and HsTx1—The efficacy of MTX-HsTx1 in blocking K+ currents from voltage-gated (Kv1.1, Kv1.2, and Kv1.3) and Ca2+-activated K+ channels (IK and BK) was examined by electrophysiology. As shown in Fig. 4a, MTX-HsTx1 blocks Kv1.1 K+ outward currents with high affinity. The peptide is active at concentrations above 20 pm and achieves the highest current block at about 100 nm. The effect of 100 nm MTX-HsTx1 is readily reversible upon washout of the peptide (data not shown). The current blockage by MTX-HsTx1 is concentration-dependent, with an IC50 value of 1. 0 ± 0. 1 nm (Fig. 4a). The chimera is even more potent than HsTx1, which blocks Kv1.1 channels with an IC50 value of 7. 0 ± 1.0 nm in identical experimental conditions. In contrast, as shown previously, MTX has no activity on Kv1.1 channel (8Castle N.A. London D.O. Creech C. Fajloun Z. Stocker J.W. Sabatier J.M. Mol.

These data indicate that, contrary to SK channels, the β-sheet region is key to conferring toxin sensitivity toward voltage-gated Kv1.1 channels. Next, the effects of MTX-HsTx1 on Kv1.3 channels were investigated (Fig. 4b). MTX-HsTx1 also blocks Kv1.3 currents with an IC50 value of 4.0 ± 1.0 nm, which is intermediate to the blocking efficacy of HsTx1 (IC50 value of 11 ± 2 pm) and MTX (IC50 value of 155 ± 32 nm). Considering the data obtained on both Kv1.1 and Kv1.3 channels, it appears that the β-sheet region may also be key for the blocking efficacy of MTX-HsTx1 onto Kv1.3. However, a structural involvement of its helical region in the sensitivity for Kv1.3 cannot be excluded. Thereafter, we examined the effects of MTX-HsTx1 on Kv1.2 channels because, contrary to Kv1.1 and Kv1.3, Kv1.2 channel currents are potently blocked by MTX but not HsTx1 (Fig. 4c). Interestingly, MTX-HsTx1 was inactive on Kv1.2 channels, thereby reproducing the pharmacological behavior of HsTx1, but not that of MTX (IC50 value of MTX = 1.0 ± 0.1 nm). Altogether, these experimental data strongly support a key participation of the β-sheet region in conferring K+ current blockage competence and selectivity of the chimera toxin to the different voltage-gated Kv1-type channels. Because the contribution of the helical and β-sheet regions varied depending on whether SK or Kv channels were concerned, effects of these peptides were also evaluated on IK channels. As shown in Fig. 4d, MTX-HsTx1 behaved similarly to HsTx1 in the blocking efficacy of IK channels. The IC50 values obtained were 460 ± 58 nm for MTX-HsTx1, 625 ± 18 nm for HsTx1, and 1.0 ± 0.2 nm for MTX. Thus, IK channels behaved as voltage-gated K+ channels in that they were more sensitive to the β-sheet region than to the helical region of the toxin. This indicates a fundamental structural difference between IK and SK channels despite their evident Ca2+ sensitivity. We have also studied the effects of MTX, HsTx1, and MTX-HsTx1 on BK channels but observed no blocking properties of either peptide (data not shown). Concluding Remarks—In the present work, we have demonstrated that it is possible to chemically produce a chimera toxin without encountering specific oxidation and/or folding problems. In the present case, MTX-HsTx1 underwent proper oxidative folding resulting in a toxin-like compound that still exhibits the classical α/β scaffold of scorpion toxins. Not only does MTX-HsTx1 fold properly, but it also possesses its own set of pharmacological properties. Most often, toxin analogues are produced that display changes in toxin affinity for one or more channel types. To our knowledge, this approach has never generated a compound with such clear distinct selectivity (e.g. a point-mutated toxin analogue that potently blocks a channel type initially insensitive to the parent toxin). Here, in contrast, complete domain swapping from one toxin to the other, between two toxins of dramatically different selectivity, appears as a unique way to impart novel pharmacological properties borrowed from each toxin type. In our particular example, MTX-HsTx1 conserved the ability to bind onto SK channels, a property borrowed from MTX, whereas it blocks Kv1.1 and Kv1.3 at the low nanomolar concentration range, a property borrowed from HsTx1. In the process of defining the pharmacological profile of MTX-HsTx1, we found that toxin helical regions appear to contribute greatly to the recognition of SK channels. In contrast, the β-sheet region appeared more important for the recognition of both Kv1-type and IK channels. From this study, we have concluded that whole toxin domain swapping, combined with selective amino acid mutations, will represent a powerful approach to generate potent analogues with novel channel selectivity.

In contrast, the chloroplast thylakoid homolog Albino3 (Alb3) facilitates the insertion of only a specialized subset of proteins, and the vast majority insert into thylakoids by a pathway that is so far unique to chloroplasts. In this study, we have analyzed the role of Alb3 in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, which contains internal thylakoids that are similar in some respects to those of chloroplasts. The single alb3 gene (slr1471) was disrupted by the introduction of an antibiotic cassette, and photoautotrophic growth resulted in the generation of a merodiploid species (but not full segregation), indicating an essential role for Alb3 in maintaining the photosynthetic apparatus. Thylakoid organization is lost under these conditions, and the levels of photosynthetic pigments fall to ∼40% of wild-type levels. Photosynthetic electron transport and oxygen evolution are reduced by a similar extent. Growth on glucose relieves the selective pressure to maintain photosynthetic competence, and under these conditions, the cells become completely bleached, again indicating that Alb3 is essential for thylakoid biogenesis.

The insertion of newly synthesized membrane proteins is a complex process that has been studied in a variety of experimental systems. In cases where the proteins insert post-translationally, such as with chloroplast and mitochondrial membrane proteins, hydrophobic proteins must avoid aggregation while exposed to aqueous environments and then insert into the correct membrane bilayer with the correct topology. During this process, hydrophilic loop regions need to be transferred across the entire bilayer. Many aspects of the overall insertion process have been studied, and popular model systems have included the bacterium Escherichia coli, as well as mitochondria and chloroplasts, both of which evolved from prokaryotes. In E. coli, it is known that most plasma membrane proteins initially interact with soluble translocation apparatus in the form of a signal recognition particle (SRP) 1The abbreviations used are: SRP, signal recognition particle; Alb3, Albino3; μE, microeinsteins; PSII, photosystem II; ORF, open reading frame.1The abbreviations used are: SRP, signal recognition particle; Alb3, Albino3; μE, microeinsteins; PSII, photosystem II; ORF, open reading frame. and FtsY. These factors bind nascent or newly synthesized membrane proteins and transfer them to membrane-bound translocation apparatus that typically include the SecYEG translocon and an associated factor, YidC (1de Gier J.W. Scotti P.A. Saaf A. Valent Q.A. Kuhn A. Luirink J. von Heijne G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14646-14651Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 2Dalbey R.E. Kuhn A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 51-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Transfer into the membrane involves GTP hydrolysis by SRP and FtsY. A subset of inner membrane proteins does not require the SRP/Sec apparatus but, nevertheless, rely on YidC for efficient insertion, prompting suggestions that this protein may act as a “translocon” in its own right (3Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moeller I. Wiedmann M. Phillips G. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). With either pathway, the “positive-inside” rule exerts a major influence in determining the topology adopted by the protein during insertion (4Von Heijne G. Annu Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 167-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar).Although descended from prokaryotes, mitochondria lack SRP, FtsY, and Sec apparatus (at least in most cases, including yeasts and mammals) and, instead, insert inner membrane proteins by other means. Carrier proteins are inserted during import by a pathway that appears to be unique to mitochondria (5Sirrenberg C. Endres M. Folsch H. Stuart R.A. Neupert W. Brunner M. Nature. 1998; 391: 912-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 6Koehler C.M. Jarosch E. Tokatlidis K. Schmid K. Schweyen R.J. Schatz G. Science. 1998; 279: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), but other proteins insert from the matrix side. These proteins include mitochondrial translation products together with cytosolically synthesized inner membrane proteins that are first imported into the matrix before insertion. Although the insertion mechanisms have not been fully elucidated, this pathway requires the action of OxaI, a homolog of E. coli YidC (7Hell K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1281-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar).In chloroplasts, the biogenesis of thylakoid membrane proteins occurs by at least two distinct pathways. Most are imported from the cytosol, after which a subset follows an SRP/FtsY-dependent pathway that resembles that of E. coli in many respects (8Schuenemann D. Gupta S. Persello-Cartieaux F.

Traffic. 2001; 2: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The OxaI homolog Albino3 (Alb3) plays a vital role in the insertion of SRP substrates into the thylakoid membrane (11Moore M.

One possible difference, when compared with the E. coli pathway, is that the Sec apparatus may not be used for the insertion of membrane proteins. Thylakoids do contain a Sec system (13Yuan J. Henry R. McCaffery M. Cline K. Science. 1994; 266: 796-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 14Laidler V. Chaddock A.M. Knott T.G. Walker D. Robinson C. J. Biol.

Summer E.J. Ma X. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Although it has not been fully established that this Sec system is not involved in membrane protein insertion, current models suggest that Alb3 acts independently, as appears to be the case with its mitochondrial counterpart. Whether acting independently or in conjunction with other apparatus, it has been proposed that OxaI family proteins act as membrane-bound chaperones that stabilize transmembrane segments during the insertion process (17Kuhn A. Stuart R. Henry R. Dalbey R.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 510-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).Although YidC and OxaI play vital roles in the insertion of a wide range of membrane proteins in E. coli and mitochondria, the same does not apply to Alb3 in chloroplasts. The SRP/Alb3 pathway is used by a surprisingly small set of thylakoid membrane proteins (reviewed in Ref. 10Robinson C. Thompson S.J. Woolhead C. Traffic. 2001; 2: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In vitro insertion assays have shown that Alb3 plays a critical role in the insertion of the major light-harvesting chlorophyll-binding protein Lchb1 and a few other light-harvesting chlorophyll-binding proteins, but the vast majority of other proteins do not require SRP, FtsY, Sec apparatus, Alb3, or any known form of chloroplastic translocation apparatus for efficient insertion into thylakoids (12Woolhead C.A.

In keeping with this finding, studies on a Chlamydomonas reinhardtii mutant lacking functional Alb3 have shown that only this subset of proteins are depleted, with other thylakoid membrane proteins present at wild-type levels (20Bellafiore S. Ferris P. Naver H. Gohre V. Rochaix J.D. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 2303-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Because these proteins do not require either nucleoside triphosphates or a proton motive force for insertion, it has been suggested that they may insert spontaneously into the thylakoid, although this has not been formally proven.In this context, cyanobacteria represent interesting model systems, because they are prokaryotes but contain internal thylakoid membranes that resemble those of chloroplasts in several respects. This raises the question as to whether the Alb3 pathway is important for the majority of proteins, as in E. coli, or whether the novel “spontaneous” pathway predominates in the thylakoids of this organism. One possibility raised by previous studies is that Alb3 is important for the insertion of plasma membrane proteins, but not for thylakoid membrane biogenesis. In this study, we have addressed these questions by disrupting the gene encoding the single Alb3 homolog in Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. We show that the Alb3 homolog plays a vital role in thylakoid biogenesis and/or maintenance; depletion of the proteins leads to a severe loss of thylakoid content and organization, and further growth on glucose in the dark leads to a total loss of photosynthetic competence and subsequent cell death.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGrowth of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803-G (Glucose-tolerant)—The glucose-tolerant laboratory strain of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 (21Williams J.G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 766-778Crossref Scopus (844) Google Scholar), which exhibits photoheterotrophic growth in the presence of 5 mm glucose, was used in this study. The cultures were maintained in 100-ml aliquots of BG11 minimal media (22Rippka R. Deruelles J. Waterbury J.B. Herdman M. Stanier R.Y. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1979; 111: 1-61Crossref Google Scholar) and grown at 30 μE/m2/s with continuous shaking.Transformation of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803—Transformation was essentially as described in Ref. 21Williams J.G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 766-778Crossref Scopus (844) Google Scholar. An exponentially growing culture was resuspended to give a final cell concentration of 1 × 109 cells ml-1. Ten microliters of plasmid DNA were added to 150 μl of cells and incubated under normal growth illumination (30 μE/m2/s) at 30 °C for 60 min. The cells were then plated onto BG11 plates without selection and incubated for 16-18 h in the light. Antibiotic was introduced underneath the plate to the desired concentration (50 μg ml-1 spectinomycin). Transformants appeared in 7-10 days and were streaked at least three times onto selective plates to ensure segregation. Final cultures of transformed Synechocystis were grown at 30 μE/m2/s at 30 °C in 100-ml cultures of sterile BG11 supplemented with 50 μg ml-1 of spectinomycin with constant shaking at 150 revolutions/min. Integration of the antibiotic cassette was confirmed by Southern blotting.Generation of an slr1471 Disruption Mutant in Synechocystis sp. PCC6803—The forward Fslr1471 ACCGTTCTCGGCTAGAGCTG (5′-3′) and reverse Rslr1471 GCTCGAAGAACTTCTCACTC (5′-3′) primers were used to generate a 1511bp PCR product including the slr1471 open reading frame (ORF) and flanking regions. The PCR product was TA-cloned into the pCR2.1 vector according to the manufacturer's instructions (TA Cloning® Kit, Invitrogen). The unique restriction site HincII within the cloned slr1471 ORF was used to linearize the vector, and the ω fragment was ligated in using a standard ligation protocol provided by the manufacturer (T4 DNA ligase, Fermentas Life Sciences), resulting in the disruption of the slr1471 gene. The ω fragment was restricted from the pHP45Ω plasmid (23Prentki P. Krisch H.M. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 29: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar) using flanking SmaI restriction sites. Both HincII and SmaI generate blunt-ended fragments allowing for a blunt-ended ligation. The resulting plasmid p1471TAΩ was transformed into Synechocystis cells, with selection based on spectinomycin resistance from the presence of the ω cassette. Restriction digestion with BamHI was used to confirm the presence of the ω cassette, giving a restriction pattern of 2056 bp (ω fragment), 4478 bp, and 954 bp.Chlorophyll Fluorescence and Oxygen Evolution Measurements— Chlorophyll fluorescence was measured at 30 °C using a pulse amplitude-modulated fluorometer (Hansatech, King's Lynn, UK). Maximum photochemical efficiency was calculated as Fm(dark) - Fo/Fm(dark), and the quantum yield of photosystem II photochemistry during illumination was calculated as Fm′ - Fo/Fm′.Oxygen evolution experiments were carried out essentially according to Mannan and Pakrasi (24Mannan R. Pakrasi H.B. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Cells in liquid culture were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 revolutions/min for 5 min at room temperature. Following harvest, the cells were resuspended into a chlorophyll concentration of 5 μg in 3 ml of fresh BG11. Whole chain electron transport was measured using a Clark-type electrode in the presence of 10 mm NaHCO3 at a constant temperature of 30 °C. Pigmentation measurements were taken according to Myers et al. (25Myers J. Graham J-R. Wang R.T. Plant Physiol. 1980; 66: 1144-1149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Confocal Microscopy—Bleaching experiments were performed using a Leica DM RE microscope equipped with a Leica confocal scanner TCS SP2 at 543 nm. Autofluorescence of the wild-type Synechocystis and the alb3 mutant was monitored between 600 and 700 nm. The physiological application pack included in the Leica Confocal Software 2.5 was used for bleaching. Twenty-five scans at 400 Hz in 75 s were carried out and autofluorescence monitored per scan number.Transmission Electron Microscopy—The cells from wild-type and mutant strains were collected and fixed in an equal volume of 6% glutaraldehyde in 0.2 m sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2, for 2 h. After fixation, the cells were washed in distilled water three times for 10 min. The fixed cells were then incubated in 1% osmium tetroxide, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 0.8% potassium ferricyanide for 60 min followed by washing in distilled water three times for 10 min. The cells were then embedded in 2% agar and incubated in 70% ethanol for 30 min at room temperature followed by a further overnight incubation at 4 °C. After continued dehydration, the cells were embedded in Spurr's resin (26Spurr A.R. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1969; 26: 31-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (10148) Google Scholar), and 60-90-nm sections were cut using a Reichart ultracut 4 ultramicrotome. Ultrathin sections were then counterstained with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate followed by Reynolds lead citrate and viewed using a JEOL 1220 transmission electron microscope (JEOL UK, Ltd.). Images were recorded on either Kodak SO-163 electron microscopy film or captured with an SIS Megaview III digital camera (Soft Imaging Systems, Gmbh).RESULTSDepletion of Alb3 in Synechocystis—Data base searches of the Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 genome reveal the presence of a single open reading frame, slr1471, encoding a protein homologous to the OxaI/YidC/Alb3 family of proteins (27Yen M-R. Harley K.T. Tseng Y-H. Saier M.H. FEMS Microbiol. Letts. 2001; 204: 223-231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 42.6 kDa slr1471 gene product is 38.5% identical to the Arabidopsis thaliana Alb3 protein and is predicted to contain several transmembrane spans (not shown). The slr1471 gene product is hereafter termed Alb3 in view of the fact that it is more homologous to chloroplastic Alb3 than to other members of the OxaI family of proteins.The presence of a single alb3 gene in Synechocystis is interesting, because it implies that this protein may facilitate the insertion of proteins into both the plasma and thylakoid membranes. However, it is also possible that thylakoids do not require this protein, because all of the chloroplastic Alb3 substrates (major three-membrane-span light-harvesting chlorophyll-binding proteins) are absent in Synechocystis. To address this issue, we set out to deplete the Alb3 protein in Synechocystis using standard techniques in which the slr1471 ORF is disrupted with a spectinomycin cassette by homologous recombination. Fig. 1A shows the location of the slr1471 ORF within the Synechocystis genome. The adjacent ORFs, slr1470 and slr1472, encode hypothetical proteins of unknown function, and the available evidence from data base tools, such as the genome atlas program (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/GenomeAtlas/) indicates that each has its own promoter. Of the other ORFs, slr1384 encodes a protein homologous to DnaJ, and the slr1383 gene product is an apparent myo-inositol-1(or 4)-monophosphatase. None are involved in protein insertion processes or photosynthesis, and each appears to be transcribed independently; hence, insertional inactivation of slr1471 should not lead to pleiotropic effects through polar effects on adjacent genes. The construct used, p1471TAΩ, is shown in detail in Fig. 1B.Glucose-tolerant Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 cells were transformed with p1471TAΩ and grown on plates in the presence of spectinomycin as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” This wild-type strain differs from obligatorily photoautotrophic strains in containing a single point mutation in a two-component signaling system that confers the ability to grow heterotrophically on glucose in the dark (in practice, low intensity blue light is required for cell viability (28Anderson S.L. McIntosh L. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2761-2767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but this level of light is too low to support photosynthesis, and these conditions are hereafter referred to as dark-grown). Initial studies were carried out under photoautotrophic conditions, i.e. in the absence of glucose, where the cells rely totally on photosynthesis as an energy source. Resistant colonies were analyzed by Southern blotting using the slr1471 coding sequence as probe to test for the integration of the Ω cassette. Fig. 2 shows a Southern blot of HincII-digested DNA from wild-type cells and Δslr1471Ω cells grown photoautotrophically in the light or in the dark on glucose. Fig. 2, lanes 1-3 show the results from the two different forms of wild-type cells, namely glucose-intolerant cells grown in the light (lane 1) and the glucose-tolerant strain used in this study, grown in the light (lane 2) or with glucose in the dark (lane 3). The blot shows the presence of the expected 2.1- and 2.8-kbp hybridizing bands (see Fig. 1 for restriction sites in this region). The remaining lanes contain HincII-digested DNA from the Δslr1471Ω transformant grown photoautotrophically in the light (Fig. 2, lanes 4 and 5, two independent cultures) or grown in the dark on glucose (lane 6). In each case, the 2.1- and 2.8-kbp bands are evident, together with a 4.1-kbp band that represents the 2.1-kbp HincII fragment with an inserted ω cassette. These data show that the cells are merodiploid, containing a mixture of wild-type and disrupted slr1471 ORFs, and identical results were obtained with every Δslr1471Ω culture studied, whether grown in the light or dark. Full segregation could not be achieved, and further increases in antibiotic concentration led to cell death, indicating that Alb3 is essential for viability in general.Fig. 2Partial segregation of disrupted slr1471 ORFs in the Δslr1471Ω mutant.

The wild-type cells exhibit the usual morphology in which the thylakoids are found in the periphery of the cells, organized in several discrete groups that are each apparently tethered to the plasma membrane. In contrast, the Δslr1471Ω cells fall into two groups. In a minority of cells (3% of those analyzed in this study), distinct thylakoid membranes can be visualized, although at levels lower than in wild-type cells; four examples are shown in panel Δslr1471Ω (1). The remainder, and vast majority of the cells, are as shown in panel Δslr1471Ω (2). The periphery of the cell contains electron-dense material that is pigmented and photosynthetically competent (see Fig. 6); this region thus does contain thylakoids, but the morphology of these membranes is very different, and they are not organized to any detectable extent. It is notable that the thylakoids do not exhibit the level of separation that is evident with wild-type thylakoids. The Δslr1471Ω cells are also slightly smaller than wild-type cells, with the diameter reduced by an average of 10%.Fig. 3Partial disruption of slr1471 leads to a loss of thylakoid organization. The figure shows electron micrographs of 4 typical wild-type cells (WT) together with Δslr1471Ω cells grown photoautotrophically as shown in Fig. 1B. The panel denoted Δslr1471Ω (1) shows four cells that represent a minority of the transformants grown under these conditions; a range of more typical cells are shown in the Δslr1471Ω panel.

The figure shows light-dependent chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters for wild-type (closed circles) and Δslr1471Ω (closed triangles) cells. A, maximum photochemical efficiency of PSII, reflecting photoinhibition, was calculated as Fm(dark) - Fo/Fm(dark). The cells were exposed to a continuous irradiance of 1000 μmol m-2 s-1, sufficient to saturate photosynthesis. Samples were removed every 20 min and dark-adapted briefly to reverse the state transition to state 2. Saturating pulses were then applied to measure Fm(dark). B, actual quantum yield of photosystem II photochemistry during illumination was calculated as Fm′ - Fo/Fm′. The cells were exposed to actinic irradiance for ∼5 min, resulting in a state 2 to state 1 transition. When state 2 was established, the cells were exposed to saturating light pulses to record Fm′. All chlorophyll fluorescence measurements were carried out at 30 °C. Data are mean ± S.E. for a minimum of five measurements of cells grown in at least two separate flasks.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Δslr1471Ω Cells Contain Reduced Levels of Pigment but Are Photosynthetically Competent—Whole cell absorption spectra for Δslr1471Ω cells under these conditions show an overall decrease in pigmentation in the mutant compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 4A). Decreases are seen in the absorption maxima of Δslr1471Ω cells at wavelengths of 625 and 686 nm, corresponding to phycocyanin and chlorophyll, respectively. In addition, absorption in the Soret region is lower in the mutant compared with the wild type. Direct measurement of pigment content/unit cell confirms the decreases in both phycocyanobilin and chlorophyll in the Δslr1471Ω mutant, as shown in the tabular data below the absorption spectra. In both cases, the pigment level is approximately one-third of the wild-type levels.Fig. 4Photoautotrophically grown Δslr1471Ω cells exhibit a loss of pigment and changes within the membrane protein complement. A, graph shows a whole cell absorbance spectrum of equal numbers of wild-type versus Δslr1471Ω cells; the table shows the chlorophyll and phycocyanobilin content within the cells. B, membranes were isolated from wild-type (WT) and Δslr1471Ω cells and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie staining.

Many of the bands present in the wild-type membranes are also present in the Δslr1471Ω membranes, but there are notable differences, and the asterisks denote polypeptides that are enriched in one membrane or the other. These polypeptides have yet to be identified, and it is presently unclear whether they are located in the thylakoid or plasma membrane.Light saturation curves for oxygen evolution were measured for both wild-type and Δslr1471Ω cells (Fig. 5). Maximum rates of photosynthesis are lower for Δslr1471Ω cells when compared with the wild type, with values of 580 μmol O2·mg chl-1·hr-1 and 1600 μmol O2·mg chl-1·hr-1, respectively. However, the values are expressed on a unit chlorophyll basis and mirror the decreases in chlorophyll content/cell shown in Fig. 4, which in turn reflects the variable loss of thylakoids observed in the electron micrograph images. As with the chlorophyll measurements, the lower values of photosynthetic rate observed in Δslr1471Ω samples represent an average decrease across the cell sample.Fig. 5Light-grown Δslr1471Ω cells have reduced pigmentation but are photosynthetically active. The figure shows light-dependant oxygen evolution for wild-type (closed circles) and Δslr1471Ω (closed triangles) cells. Whole chain electron transport was measured using a Clarke-type oxygen electrode in the presence of 10 mm NaHCO3 at a constant temperature of 30 °C. The cells were resuspended in 3 ml of fresh BGII at a chlorophyll concentration of 5 μg ml-1 and dark-adapted for 10 min in the electrode chamber prior to measurement.

We found that the monomer-monomer interaction in the pre-pore is highly stable because urea promotes oligomer denaturation without disassembly.

It has been proposed that proteins must partially unfold to facilitate membrane insertion and channel formation. In mammalian pore-forming toxins, unfolding is triggered by acidic pH (22Evans L.J.A. Goble M.L. Hales K.A. Lakey J.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13180-13185Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These data correlate with the proposition that the membrane surface has an acidic pH that could be up to 2 pH units lower than the bulk pH (23Vécsey-Semjén B. Möllby R. van der Goot F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8655-8660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Also, acidic pH could be encountered upon cell internalization of the toxins in acidic membrane compartments (22Evans L.J.A. Goble M.L. Hales K.A. Lakey J.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13180-13185Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, lepidopteran insects have high basic pH (up to pH 11) in the midgut, the site of Cry1A toxin action. We analyzed, for the first time, the unfolding events of Cry1Ab toxin leading to efficient membrane insertion and pore formation. Structure stability of the monomeric toxin, the prepore complex in solution, and the membrane-inserted pore of the Cry1Ab toxin was determined by equilibrium unfolding induced by chaotropic agents at different pH values monitoring the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. Additionally, unfolding of toxin structures by temperature was analyzed by 1-anilinon-aphthalene-8-sulfonic acid (ANS) binding to hydrophobic regions, and the energy transfer of Trp residues to ANS bound to the partially unfolded protein. Our results show that the prepore complex and membrane-inserted pore of Cry1Ab have a more flexible conformation than the monomeric toxin and that alkaline pH increases the flexibility of these structures. Also, in the membrane-inserted pore, only domain I was protected from heat denaturation, suggesting that it may be inserted into the membrane in contrast to domains II and III. Finally, the alkaline pH induces a looser conformation of the membrane-inserted domain I that is important for an active channel formation correlating with the high pH conditions inside the midgut lumen of susceptible insects. Cry1Ab Toxin Purification—Cry1Ab crystals were produced in the acrystalliferous B. thuringiensis strain 407 cry– transformed with pHT315 plasmid (24Arantes O. Lereclus D. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) harboring the cry1Ab gene (pHT315–1Ab). The B. thuringiensis strain was grown for 3 days at 29 °C in nutrient broth sporulation medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml erythromycin. After sporulation, crystals were purified by sucrose gradients as reported (10Gómez I. Sánchez J. Miranda R. Bravo A. Soberón M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and solubilized in 50 mm Na2CO3, pH 10.5, 0.2% β-mercaptoethanol. Protoxin activation was performed as described (10Gómez I. Sánchez J. Miranda R. Bravo A. Soberón M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) by incubation for 1 h with scFv73 antibody in a mass ratio 1:4 and digestion with midgut juice (5%) for 1 h at 37 °C. Phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (1 mm) was added to stop the reaction. Purification of monomeric and oligomeric pre-pore of Cry1Ab was achieved by size-exclusion chromatography in Superdex 200 HR 10/30 (Amersham Biosciences) fast protein liquid chromatography as reported previously (10Gómez I. Sánchez J. Miranda R. Bravo A. Soberón M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 16Rausell C. Muñoz-Garay C. Gómez I. Miranda-CassoLuengo R. Rudiño-Piñera E. Soberón M. Bravo A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 166-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Preparation of Small Unilamellar Vesicles (SUV)—Egg-derived phosphatidylcholine lipids from chloroform stocks (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) were dried by argon flow evaporation in glass vials at 2.6 μmol total followed by overnight storage under vacuum to remove residual chloroform. The lipids were hydrated in 2.6 ml of 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm KCl, pH 7.2, buffer by vortexing. To prepare SUV, the lipid suspension was subjected to sonication five times for 5 min in a Branson-1200 bath sonicator (Danbury, CT). SUV were used within 4–5 days upon their preparation. Insertion of the Pre-pore Oligomeric Structure into SUV—To analyze the interaction of Cry1Ab with the membrane, the purified oligomeric pre-pore structure was incubated with phosphatidylcholine SUV at a lipid/protein ratio of 5000, a condition where more than 90% of pre-pore is inserted into the membrane (16Rausell C. Muñoz-Garay C. Gómez I. Miranda-CassoLuengo R. Rudiño-Piñera E. Soberón M. Bravo A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 166-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The mixture was incubated for 30 min at 25 °C, and the membrane fraction was separated by ultracentrifugation (1 h at 100,000 × g), and fluorescence spectra were recorded in both the supernatant and pellet fractions. Unfolding with Chaotropic Agents—Equilibrium unfolding experiments were performed at different pH in the following buffer systems: for pH 4, 50 mm acetic acid, 50 mm H3PO4 adjusted with NaOH; for pH 7, 50 mm NaH2PO4 adjusted with NaOH; and for pH 11, 50 mm Na2HPO4 adjusted with NaOH. All buffers contain 150 mm NaCl. The denaturant urea or GdmHCl was added from stock solutions (10 m). Buffer, denaturant, and protein (50 nm final concentration) from concentrated stocks were mixed, and samples were incubated 12 h at 35 °C. All experiments were performed at least three times. Tryptophan Fluorescence—Fluorescence measurements were made in an Aminco Bowman Luminescence (Urbana, IL) steady-state fluorescence spectrometer equipped with a thermostat cell holder. The excitation wavelength was 295 nm, and slit widths were 4 nm for excitation and emission. In order to measure the effect of denaturants, the intensity at the maximal emission wavelength (λmax) of Trp fluorescence was calculated for each condition. For monomeric or oligomeric structures of Cry1Ab, the emission λmax values were 336 and 333 nm, respectively. Normalization of these data was performed by calculating the apparent fluorescence intensity (Iapp) according to Equation 1,Iapp=(In−I)/(In−Iu)(Eq. 1) where I represents the fluorescent intensity at any point. In is the intensity value of the native protein, and Iu indicates the completely unfolded proteins (in 8 m urea or 6 m GdmHCl). Experiments were performed at least three times, and the average fluorescence intensity was calculated. Limited Proteolysis—Limited proteolysis of the monomeric and the oligomeric structures of Cry1Ab was performed in proteins partially denatured with 4 m GdmHCl, pH 4, or 1–5 m urea, pH 7.0. Proteinase K was added in a 5:1 or 10:1 protease/toxin ratio (w/w), and samples were incubated for 30 min at 25 °C. Digestions were stopped by adding 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and samples were precipitated by adding trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 10% (10 min at –20 °C), washed two times with H2O, suspended in 0.03 n NaOH, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 8 or 12% gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) Immobilon membranes (Amersham Biosciences) for Western blot detection. The blots were blocked with 5% powdered milk in PBS (50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl) and 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated with anti-Cry1Ab polyclonal antibody (1:3,000) or monoclonal antibody 4D6 (1:1,000). mAb-4D6 recognized epitope 164–222 in domain I (25Höfte H. Van Rie J. Jansens S. Van Houtven A. Vanderbruggen H. Vaeck M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1988; 54: 2010-2017Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the blots were incubated with goat anti-rabbit or rabbit anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (1:5,000) secondary antibodies, respectively (Sigma), and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Additionally, Western blots were analyzed with scFv45 antibody that recognized domain II–III as described (26Gomez I. Oltean D.I. Sanchez J. Bravo A. Gill S.S. Soberón M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28906-28912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and scFv45 was detected with anti-c-Myc antibody (Sigma) (1:1000), followed by incubation with a secondary goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated with peroxidase (Sigma) (1:1000) and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence as above. ANS Binding and Energy Transfer from Trp Residues to ANS Bound to the Protein—Binding of ANS (Mr 299.34) was measured as described previously (10Gómez I. Sánchez J. Miranda R. Bravo A. Soberón M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The excitation and emission wavelengths of ANS are 380 and 480 nm respectively, and the spectral bandwidths were 5 nm. The final ANS concentration was 50 μm, and the final protein concentration was 15 nm for the oligomeric Cry1Ab structure or 50 nm for the monomeric Cry1Ab. For membrane-inserted protein, a lipid/protein ratio of 5000 (75 μm phosphatidylcholine SUV final concentration) was used. Energy transfer by FRET analysis between Trp and ANS was analyzed by using an excitation wavelength (λex) of 295 nm instead of 380 nm. Under these conditions tryptophan residues are excited, and energy transfer to ANS fluorophore occurs if both (Trp and ANS) are in close proximity. Disruption of Tetrameric Structure—Different procedures were used to disrupt the Cry1Ab tetrameric structure. The pre-pore complex was treated with 8 m GdmHCl, pH 7.0 (12 h at room temperature). The samples were precipitated by adding trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 10% (10 min at –20 °C) and were washed two times with H2O, suspended in 0.03 n NaOH. Pre-pore complex was also treated with 20% trichloroacetic acid (final concentration) (12 h at –20 °C), washed two times with H2O, and suspended in 0.03 n NaOH. Alternatively, samples were treated with 70% formic acid for 30 min at room temperature as described for aerolysin (27Lesieur C. Frutiger S. Hughes G. Kellner R. Pattus F. van der Goot F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36722-36728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The sample was then frozen and evaporated using a Speed-Vac, resuspended in water, frozen, and evaporated again. These samples were loaded in SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred onto PVDF Immobilon membranes (Amersham Biosciences) for Western blot analysis as above. Pore Formation Activity in SUV—Membrane potential was monitored with the positively charged fluorescent dye, 3,3′-dipropylthiodicarbocyanine (Molecular Probes), as described previously (28Lorence A. Darszon A. Bravo A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Fluorescence was recorded at 620/670 nm excitation/emission wavelengths in an Aminco SLM spectrofluorometer. One μm final concentration of 3,3′-dipropylthiodicarbocyanine was added to the following assay buffer systems (Fi): for pH 7: 150 mm CsCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES-HCl, pH 7; for pH 4: 150 mm CsCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm MES, pH 4; and for pH 11: 150 mm CsCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm CAPS, pH 11. Hyperpolarization causes dye internalization into the SUV and a decrease in fluorescence, whereas depolarization causes the opposite effect. SUV (15 μm) previously loaded with 150 mm KCl were suspended in 900 μl of the corresponding assay buffer. After equilibration of the dye (Fo), 3 nm Cry1Ab oligomeric pre-pore toxin was added. Changes in membrane potential were monitored by successive additions of KCl (4, 10, 23, 49, 100, and 198 mm, final concentration) to the SUV suspension (Fn). In Fig. 5, numbers 1–6 above the traces correspond to each one of the KCl additions. The same amount of toxin buffer was added for control traces. Analyses of the slope (m) of changes in fluorescence (ΔF) (%) versus K+ equilibrium potential (EK) (mV) are reported in this work. ΔF was calculated as ((Fn – Fo)/Fi) × 100. EK was calculated with the Nernst equation. Membrane potential determinations were done four times. Protein Concentration—Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin as standard and by absorbance at 280 nm using the extinction coefficient Em280=5700 M−1/cm−1 for Cry1Ab toxin. Urea and GdmHCl Unfolding of Monomeric Cry1Ab Toxin— Unfolding of monomeric Cry1Ab toxin was studied previously (29Convents D. Houssier C. Lasters I. Lauwereys M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1369-1375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Convents D. Cherlet M. Van Damme J. Lasters I. Lauwereys M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), demonstrating that Cry1Ab has a biphasic unfolding when treated with GdmHCl, suggesting a sequential unfolding of two different regions of the toxin. At pH 4.0, the first unfolding step corresponded to the carboxyl-terminal region (domains II and III) (29Convents D. Houssier C. Lasters I. Lauwereys M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1369-1375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Convents D. Cherlet M. Van Damme J. Lasters I. Lauwereys M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Also, it was shown that monomeric Cry1Ab toxin became less stable at alkaline pH compared with acidic pH, showing higher denaturation at lower GdmHCl concentrations (29Convents D. Houssier C. Lasters I. Lauwereys M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1369-1375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Convents D. Cherlet M. Van Damme J. Lasters I. Lauwereys M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We analyzed the stability of pure monomeric Cry1Ab toxin by measuring its unfolding in urea and GdmHCl. After 12 h of incubation in 7 m urea at 35 °C, unfolding was reversible because 100% of the initial M. sexta mortality produced by the toxin could be recovered upon subsequent dilution in urea free buffer. In contrast, 12 h of unfolding in 6 m Gdm-HCl at 35 °C was irreversible without recovery of toxicity after removal of GdmHCl (data not shown). The extent of unfolding of the monomeric Cry1Ab toxin was followed by measuring the intrinsic fluorescence of the tryptophan residues. Cry1Ab toxin contains nine Trp residues, seven of them located in domain I and two in domain II. The fluorescence characteristics of the indole side chains could be altered with respect to the emission intensity and to the maximum emission wavelength (λmax) reflecting changes in the microenvironment of the Trp. Most proteins show a decrease in Trp fluorescence intensity upon unfolding, and this drop in the quantum yield may be correlated to water exposure of Trp. A decrease in Trp fluorescence was observed after the treatment of Cry1Ab monomeric toxin with both chaotropic agents. Fig. 1 shows the decrease in the intensity of the emission spectra of Trp residues of denatured Cry1Ab toxin with 8 m urea, pH 7.0, and concomitantly the maximal emission wavelength was shifted from 336 to 345 nm for 0–8 m urea, respectively. The total fractional change in the maximal fluorescence intensity at 336 nm was analyzed as function of the chaotropic agent concentration. The denaturation of monomeric Cry1Ab toxin with GdmHCl at pH 4 resulted in a biphasic unfolding curve (data not shown), as reported previously (29Convents D. Houssier C. Lasters I. Lauwereys M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1369-1375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We then analyzed the denaturation of Cry1Ab monomeric toxin by urea at different pH values (Fig. 2A). The unfolding curves were also biphasic, and the unfolding midpoint depended on the pH. The most stable monomeric structure was observed at pH 4 because higher urea concentrations were needed to observe the unfolding transitions of the protein. The first midpoint transition at pH 4 was observed at 5.5 m urea, and at 6 m urea a stable intermediate appeared, which was then further denatured at 7.5 m urea (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the unfolding of the protein at pH 7 showed the first midpoint transition at 2.5 m urea. The stable intermediate is observed at 4 m urea, and the second transition starts at 7 m urea. Finally, the less stable monomeric structure was observed after incubation at pH 11 where the first midpoint transition started at 1.2 m urea and the second transition at 2.5 m urea.Fig. 2Urea denaturation of the different Cry1Ab toxin structures by urea as a function of pH. Pure protein preparations of monomeric toxin (A), the pre-pore complex in solution (B), and the pore complex inserted in small unilamellar vesicles of phosphatidylcholine (C) were incubated for 12 h at 35 °C with different urea concentrations at different pH values and were monitored by tryptophan fluorescence. The apparent fluorescence intensity (Iapp) was calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Normalized denaturation curves at pH 4.0 (⋄), at pH 7.0 (▪), and at pH 11.0 (•) are presented in each panel. The excitation wavelength was 295 nm. Experiments were performed at least three times, and standard deviations are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res"
https://openalex.org/W2131030502,"Diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease, for which effective therapy to prevent the progression at advanced stages remains to be established. There is also a long debate whether diabetic glomerular injury is reversible or not. Lipoatrophic diabetes, a syndrome caused by paucity of adipose tissue, is characterized by severe insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and fatty liver. Here, we show that a genetic model of lipoatrophic diabetes (A-ZIP/F-1 mice) manifests a typical renal injury observed in human diabetic nephropathy that is associated with glomerular hypertrophy, diffuse and pronounced mesangial widening, accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins, podocyte damage, and overt proteinuria. By crossing A-ZIP/F-1 mice with transgenic mice overexpressing an adipocyte-derived hormone leptin, we also reveal that leptin completely prevents the development of hyperglycemia and nephropathy in A-ZIP/F-1 mice. Furthermore, continuous leptin administration to A-ZIP/F-1 mice by minipump beginning at 40 weeks of age significantly alleviates the glomerular injury and proteinuria. These findings demonstrate the therapeutic usefulness of leptin at least for a certain type of diabetic nephropathy. The model presented here will serve as a novel tool to analyze the molecular mechanism underlying not only the progression but also the regression of diabetic nephropathy."
https://openalex.org/W2060945789,"Abstract Surfactant Protein A (SP-A) is an abundant, multifunctional lectin that resides within the bronchoalveolar compartment of the lung and plays an important role in the innate immunity of the organ. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a human pathogen that resides in the same compartment as SP-A, and we examined the interaction between the two. Preparations of human and rat SP-A recognized the mycoplasma with high affinity in the presence of Ca2+, exhibiting apparent K′d values in the nanomolar range. Membranes prepared from the microbe also bound human and rat SP-A with similar characteristics and affinity to the intact cells. The ligand for SP-A was insensitive to proteolysis. Lipid extracts prepared from the mycoplasma, bound SP-A with high affinity when examined by ligand blot analysis. These lipid extracts were also potent competitive inhibitors (IC50 = 0.2 nm) of human SP-A binding to mycoplasma membranes. The major lipid ligands for the protein identified by mass spectrometry are a group of disaturated phosphatidylglycerols. The addition of SP-A to cultures of M. pneumoniae markedly attenuated the growth of the organism assessed by colony formation, metabolic activity, and DNA replication. The bacteriostatic effects of SP-A were reversed by dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol. These findings demonstrate that human SP-A can play a direct role in antibody-independent immunity to M. pneumoniae by interacting with lipid ligands expressed on the surface of the organism and implicate SP-A in the immediate host response to the bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2045474165,"We have recently identified the hADA3 protein, the human homologue of yeast transcriptional coactivator yADA3, as a novel HPV16 E6 target. Using ectopic expression approaches, we further demonstrated that hADA3 directly binds to the 9-cis retinoic acid receptors α and β, and functions as a coactivator for retinoid receptor-mediated transcriptional activation. Here, we examined the role of endogenous hADA3 as a coactivator for estrogen receptor (ER), an important member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. We show that ADA3 directly interacts with ERα and ERβ. Using the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we also show that hADA3 is a component of the activator complexes bound to the native ER response element within the promoter of the estrogen-responsive gene pS2. Furthermore, using an ER response element-luciferase reporter, we show that overexpression of ADA3 enhances the ERα- and ERβ-mediated sequence-specific transactivation. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed an ADA3-mediated increase in estrogen-induced expression of the endogenous pS2 gene. More importantly, using RNA interference against hADA3, we demonstrate that inhibition of endogenous hADA3 inhibited ER-mediated transactivation and the estrogen-induced increase in the expression of pS2, cathepsin D, and progesterone receptor, three widely known ER-responsive genes. The HPV E6 protein, by targeting hADA3 for degradation, inhibited the ERα-mediated transactivation and the protein expression of ER target genes. Thus, our results demonstrate that ADA3 directly binds to human estrogen receptor and enhances the transcription of ER-responsive genes, suggesting a broader role of mammalian hADA3 as a coactivator of nuclear hormone receptors and the potential role of these pathways in HPV oncogenesis.

Moras D. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2003; 3: 1573-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 2Edwards D.P. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 2000; 5: 307-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Various NRs control the transcription of distinct subsets of genes in the chromatin environment of the nucleus (3Jacobs M.N. Dickins M. Lewis D.F. J. Steroid. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 84: 117-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 4Barnes C.J. Vadlamudi R.K. Kumar R. Cell. Mol. Life. Sci. 2004; 61: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In general, NRs share a conserved structural and functional organization, with DNA-binding, ligand binding, and transcriptional activation domains (3Jacobs M.N. Dickins M. Lewis D.F. J. Steroid. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 84: 117-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 4Barnes C.J. Vadlamudi R.K. Kumar R. Cell. Mol. Life. Sci. 2004; 61: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Depending on their DNA binding and dimerization properties, NRs are subdivided into two classes: class I NRs function as homodimers and include the steroid hormone receptors, such as the estrogen (ER), androgen, and progesterone (PR) receptors, and class II NRs function as heterodimers with the 9-cis retinoic acid receptor (RXR) and include the receptors for retinoic acid (RAR), vitamin D, thyroid hormone, and peroxisome proliferators (1Greschik H.

Neoplasia. 2000; 5: 307-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Binding of cognate ligands induces a conformational change in the ligand-binding domain of NRs, which influences their function with respect to subcellular localization, dimerization, cofactor binding, and transcriptional activity (5Kumar R. Thompson E.B. Steroids. 1999; 64: 310-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that a wide range of NR cofactors perform distinct functions at target promoters, including chromatin modification and remodeling and recruitment of the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme (6Chiba N. Suldan Z. Freedman L.P. Parvin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10719-10722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A number of cofactors have been shown to bind the ligand-binding domains directly via short amphipathic α-helices containing the LXXLL sequence (7He B. Wilson E.M. Mol. Cell.

The p300 and CBP proteins are recruited to ligand-activated, DNA-bound NRs by the steroid receptor coactivators (SRC-1, -2, and -3) family of bridging factors (6Chiba N. Suldan Z. Freedman L.P.

The steroid receptor coactivator proteins have receptor interaction domains containing LXXLL motifs that contact the ligand-binding domains (13Rachez C. Gamble M. Chang C.P. Atkins G.B. Lazar M.A. Freedman L.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2718-2726Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The p300 and CBP proteins are histone acetyltransferases (HATs) that mediate the acetylation of nucleosomal histones, a covalent modification generally associated with the enhancement of transcription (reviewed in references 14An W.

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2253-2260Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Genetic studies in yeast have demonstrated yet another coactivator complex, the ADA (alteration/deficiency in activation) complex. The core components of this complex include the adapter proteins ADA3 and ADA2, and a histone acetyltransferase GCN5 (general control non-repressed 5) (16Balasubramanian R. Pray-Grant M.G. Selleck W. Grant P.A. Tan S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7989-7995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that hADA3 exists as a component of a yeast ADA-like complex that includes hADA2 and hGCN5, indicating that the functional roles of the ADA complex are evolutionarily conserved (17vom Baur E. Harbers M. Um S.J. Benecke A. Chambon P. Losson R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1278-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Studies of mammalian RXR and glucocorticoid receptor expressed in the yeast have shown a requirement for the components of yeast ADA complex, including the yADA3 gene product, for transcriptional activation (17vom Baur E. Harbers M. Um S.J. Benecke A. Chambon P. Losson R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1278-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 18Wallberg A.E. Neely K.E. Gustafsson J.A. Workman J.L. Wright A.P. Grant P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5952-5959Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, a functional role of hADA3 in NR transactivation in mammalian cells was not known until our recent work (19Zeng M. Kumar A. Meng G. Gao Q. Dimri G. Wazer D. Band H. Band V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45611-45618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Using the yeast two-hybrid interaction system, we recently identified the hADA3 protein as a novel human papilloma virus type 16 (HPV16) E6-binding protein (20Kumar A. Zhao Y. Meng G. Zeng M. Srinivasan S. Delmolino L.M. Gao Q. Dimri G. Weber G.F. Wazer D.E. Band H. Band V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5801-5812Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that the hADA3 protein binds to the high-risk (cancer-associated) but not to the low-risk HPV E6 proteins and to the immortalization-competent but not the immortalization-defective HPV16 E6 mutants, implying a role for E6-hADA3 interaction in oncogenic transformation. In view of the strong yeast genetic data for a potential role of hADA3 as a NR coactivator, isolation of hADA3 as an E6-binding protein raised the possibility that E6 may inactivate the mammalian nuclear hormone receptor function by targeting hADA3. Indeed, by using ectopic gene expression approaches, we demonstrated that hADA3 associates with and functions as a coactivator for human RXRα-mediated transactivation and that E6 inhibited this coactivator function by targeting hADA3 for degradation (19Zeng M. Kumar A. Meng G. Gao Q. Dimri G. Wazer D. Band H. Band V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45611-45618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We were surprised to find that a recent study reported that mouse ADA3, which shows >90% amino acid sequence similarity with hADA3, did not interact with human ER (21Benecke A. Gaudon C. Garnier J.M. vom Baur E. Chambon P. Losson R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2508-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), suggesting the possibility that hADA3 may selectively regulate some NRs. Given the importance of this question, we have systematically examined the interactions of human as well as mouse ADA3 proteins with ER. Contrary to findings reported by Benecke et al. (21Benecke A. Gaudon C. Garnier J.M. vom Baur E. Chambon P. Losson R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2508-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), we demonstrate that both human and mouse ADA3 directly interact with ERα and enhance the ERα-mediated transactivation of ER-responsive proteins. It is noteworthy that RNAi-mediated reduction in the level of the endogenous hADA3 protein led to an inhibition of the expression of ER-responsive genes. Thus, hADA3 protein functions as a critical component of a mammalian coactivator for the estrogen receptor, supporting the likelihood that ADA complex plays a wider role as a coactivator for NRs. Plasmid Constructs—Construction of the vectors encoding hADA3 (pCR3.1-ADA3), GST-hADA3, histidine-tagged hADA3 and FLAG-tagged E6 (pCR3.1–16 E6) has been described previously (20Kumar A. Zhao Y. Meng G. Zeng M. Srinivasan S. Delmolino L.M. Gao Q. Dimri G. Weber G.F. Wazer D.E. Band H. Band V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5801-5812Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). A mouse ADA3 cDNA expression construct (in pCMV-SPORT6 vector) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (expressed sequence tag clone no. 5348223). An EcoRI-NotI PCR product of mADA3 (sense primer, TGGAATTCTAGCGAGCTGAAGGACTGTCCA; antisense primer, ATGCGGCCGCCTACCCGTCTAGGAGCTTAC) was subcloned into pGEX-4T1 for GST-mADA3 expression and in pEF-6B (Invitrogen) to express histidine-tagged mADA3. A FLAG-ERα expression construct in V19 T3 was obtained from Dr. Richard Karas (New England Medical Center, Boston, MA). The Vit-ERE-Luc reporter was generated by cloning three copies of an ERE, corresponding to that present in the ER-responsive vitellogenin gene, in pLUC vector (Stratagene). The pEF-16E6-MYC construct, encoding the Myc-tagged E6, was kindly provided by Dr. M. Ishibashi (Aichi Cancer Center, Japan). Cells and Media—Saos2, a p53-negative osteosarcoma cell line, and MCF-7 and T-47D, breast cancer cell lines, were grown in α-minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT). Human embryonic kidney cell line 293T was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. These cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Antibodies—Generation of hADA3 antibodies has been described previously (19Zeng M. Kumar A. Meng G. Gao Q. Dimri G. Wazer D. Band H. Band V. J. Biol.

Rabbit polyclonal antibody against progesterone receptor, c-Myc, p300, and goat polyclonal antibody against cathepsin D were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). In Vitro Binding Assays—The indicated 35S-labeled proteins (ERα and hADA2 in Fig. 1, A, B, and D; hADA3 or mADA3 in Fig. 1C; ERα and its mutants in Fig. 1E; and ERβ in Fig. 1F) were generated using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate-based coupled in vitro transcription-translation system (TnT Rabbit reticulocyte lysate system; Promega, Madison, WI) in the presence of [35S]cysteine. Aliquots of 35S-labeled proteins were incubated with 1 μg of GST, GST-hADA3 (Fig. 1, A and E, or mutants in Fig. 1D), GST-mADA3 (Fig. 1A), or GST-ER (Fig. 1C), non-covalently bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads in 300 μl of lysis buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P40) for 1 h in the presence or absence of estradiol (1 μm) or in the presence of tamoxifen (1 μm) (in Fig. 1A) at 4 °C. The beads were washed with lysis buffer, and bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by fluorography. The expression of GST fusion proteins was determined using the Coomassie blue staining. In Vivo Association of hADA3 or mADA3 and ERα—5 × 105 293T cells were cultured in phenol red free α-minimal essential medium for 48 h. The cells were then co-transfected with 5 μg of FLAG-ERα and 8 μg of His-tagged hADA3 (Fig. 2A) or mADA3 (Fig. 2B) using the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method. After 12 h of transfection, the cells were treated with 100 nm of estradiol or solvent in fresh medium. Twenty-four hours later, the cell lysates were prepared in the binding buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P40), and 800-μg aliquots of protein lysates were incubated with His-Bind resin (Novagen, Madison, WI) for 5 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed five times with the binding buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted by boiling in the sample buffer followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibody to detect FLAG-ERα. The membranes were reprobed with anti-His antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to assess the expression of ADA3. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay to Detect Native pS2 Promoter-bound ADA3 and ERα—The ChIP assay was performed as described previously (22Christova R. Oelgeschlager T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In brief, 5 × 105 MCF-7 cells per 100-mm diameter dish were treated with formaldehyde to cross-link the chromatin-associated proteins to DNA. The cells were trypsinized and resuspended in lysis buffer, and nuclei were isolated and subjected to sonication to obtain chromatin-containing supernatants. Equal aliquots of chromatin supernatants were subjected to overnight IP with anti-ERα, anti-ADA3, anti-p300 (as positive control), or pre-immune (as negative control) sera. DNA associated with the IPs was extracted and used for PCR amplification of about a 300-bp fragment containing the ERE sites in pS2 promoter (sense, 5′-TAGACGGAATGGGCTTCATG-3′; antisense, 5′-AGACAGAGACGACATGTGGT-3′). Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay—5 × 105 Saos-2 per 100 mm (Fig. 4A) or 1 × 105 MCF-7 cells (Fig. 4, B and C) per 35-mm diameter dish were cultured in phenol red-free α-minimal essential medium for 48 h. The cells were then transfected with vit-ERE luciferase reporter and various expression plasmids indicated in figure legends, using the Fugene reagent (Roche, IN). Each dish also received 20 μg of SV40-Renilla reniformis luciferase reporter (pRL-SV40) to normalize the differences in transfection. The total amount of transfected DNA was kept constant by adding the vector DNA. After 12 h of transfection, the cells were either mock-treated or were treated with 10 pm (for MCF-7 cells) or 1 nm (for Saos2 cells) of E2 for an additional 24 h. The cells were lysed, and the lysates were assayed for luciferase activities using a dual-luciferase kit (Promega, WI). RNA Extraction and RT-PCR for pS2 Expression—MCF-7 cells stably expressing either vector or pCR3.1-hADA3 (5 × 105 per 100-mm dish) were cultured in phenol red-free medium for 3 days followed by either mock-treatment or treatment with 0.01 or 1 nm E2 for an additional 24 h. The total RNA was then extracted using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Equal aliquots of RNA were used for first-strand cDNA synthesis (Invitrogen), and 2-μl aliquots were used to amplify the pS2 sequence (forward primer, 5′-GCCTTTGGAGCAGAGAGGA-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TCCCTGCAGAAGTGTCTA-3′), followed by visualization using ethidium bromide-stained 1% agarose gels. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (forward primer, 5′-ACATCGCTCAGACACCATGG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GTAGTTGAGGTCAATGAAGGG-3′) was used as an internal control for the PCR. RNA Extraction and RT-PCR for RNAi Experiments—MCF-7 cells were maintained in estradiol deprived medium for 3 days followed by transfection of either control or hADA3 specific RNAi oligonucleotide (sense, 5′-GGUGACAGACGAUUCCUGAdTdT-3′ and antisense 3′-dT-dTCCACUGUCUGCUAAGGACU-5′) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Forty hours after the transfection, cells were treated with 10, 50, or 100 pm concentration of 17β estradiol (E2) for 24 h, total RNA was extracted and RT-PCR was performed (as above) with 1 μg of total RNA using pS2 (primers as above), GAPDH (as above), Cathepsin-D (forward primer, 5′-TACATGATCCCCTGTGAGAAGGT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GGGACAGCTTGTAGCCTTTGC-3′), PR (forward primer, 5′-CCATGTGGCAGATCCCACAGGAGTT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TGGAAATTCAACACTCAGTGCC-3′), and hADA3 (forward primer, 5′-TGTGCCGCATACTAAGTCC-3′; and reverse primer, 5′-GCTTCAGGATGCTCTCACGCT-3′). The RT-PCR products were run and visualized as above. Generation of Stable Cells Expressing the hADA3 RNAi—The pSUPER vector system (23Berns K. Hijmans E.M. Mullenders J. Brummelkamp T.R. Velds A. Heimerikx M. Kerkhoven R.M. Madiredjo M. Nijkamp W. Weigelt B. Agami R. Ge W. Cavet G. Linsley P.S. Beijersbergen R.L. Bernards R. Nature. 2004; 428: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar) was used for small hairpin RNA expression in mammalian cells. The OligoEngine software (OligoEngine, Seattle, WA) was used to design an oligonucleotide DNA for hADA3 small hairpin RNA corresponding to nucleotides 235–255 in the hADA3 coding sequence, and a oligonucleotide DNA for scrambled (control) RNAi. These oligonucleotides were cloned in the pSUPER-Retro vector. Viral supernatants were produced by cotransfecting the retroviral expression constructs with the pIK packaging vector into TSA54 cells, using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method (24Dimri G.P. Martinez J.L. Jacobs J.J. Keblusek P. Itahana K. Van Lohuizen M. Campisi J. Wazer D.E. Band V. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4736-4745PubMed Google Scholar). Retroviral infection of MCF-7 and T47D cells was done as described previously (25Band V. Methods Mol. Biol. 2003; 223: 237-248PubMed Google Scholar). Virally transduced cells were selected in 0.5 μg/ml puromycin for about 5 days, and the expression of endogenous hADA3 was assessed in nuclear extracts using the Western blotting, as described previously (25Band V. Methods Mol. Biol. 2003; 223: 237-248PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of ER Target Proteins in E6-expressing MCF-7 Cells—Vector or E6-expressing MCF7 cells were grown in estradiol-deprived medium for 3 days followed by treatment with 1, 10, or 100 pm doses of 17 β-estradiol (E2) for 24 h. Whole-cell lysates were prepared in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 50 μg of protein was subjected to Western blotting with anti-PR, anti-c-Myc and anti-tubulin antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Both hADA3 and mADA3 Interact Directly with ERα and ERβ—Genetic analyses have shown a requirement for yeast ADA3 for transcriptional activation by human RXR and other NRs when these were expressed in yeast (17vom Baur E. Harbers M. Um S.J. Benecke A. Chambon P. Losson R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1278-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 18Wallberg A.E. Neely K.E. Gustafsson J.A. Workman J.L. Wright A.P. Grant P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5952-5959Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have recently shown that hADA3 binds to and functions as a coactivator for RXRα (19Zeng M. Kumar A. Meng G. Gao Q. Dimri G. Wazer D. Band H. Band V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45611-45618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the mouse homologue of ADA3, which has a 99% homology with hADA3, was reported not to bind to human ER (21Benecke A. Gaudon C. Garnier J.M. vom Baur E. Chambon P. Losson R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2508-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), suggesting a selective coactivator function of hADA3. These findings prompted us to closely examine the interaction of mouse and human ADA3 with ER. As a first step, we examined the binding of GST-hADA3 or GST-mADA3 to in vitro translated, 35S-labeled ERα, using procedures described previously (19Zeng M. Kumar A. Meng G. Gao Q. Dimri G. Wazer D. Band H. Band V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45611-45618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 20Kumar A. Zhao Y. Meng G. Zeng M. Srinivasan S. Delmolino L.M. Gao Q.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2508-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). As expected, hADA2 (used as a positive control) showed clear binding to hADA3 (Fig. 1B), whereas GST alone showed no binding (Fig. 1, A, lane 2, and B, lane 2). It is noteworthy that both GST-hADA3 and GST-mADA3 bound to ERα, and this binding was observed in the presence as well the absence of the E2 ligand (lanes 3, 4, 6, and 7). In addition, incubation of the reaction mixture with tamoxifen, an antiestrogen, did not affect the hADA3 or mADA3 binding to ERα (lanes 5 and 8). These results clearly demonstrate that hADA3 and mADA3 can bind directly to ER in a ligand-independent manner, similar to our previous results with hADA3-RXR binding (19Zeng M. Kumar A. Meng G. Gao Q. Dimri G. Wazer D. Band H. Band V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45611-45618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Because Benecke et al. (21Benecke A. Gaudon C. Garnier J.M. vom Baur E. Chambon P. Losson R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2508-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) used a reverse binding assay, with in vitro-translated mADA3 and GST-ER, we also performed further binding assay using a similar strategy. Although the overall binding was lower in this assay (which may account for the inability of Benecke et al. to observe binding), both hADA3 and mADA3 could clearly bind to ERα in a ligand-independent manner (Fig. 1C, lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8). Further specificity of ER binding to hADA3 was demonstrated by its binding to the N-terminal region of hADA3 (1–215) but not to the C-terminal half (216–432) (Fig. 1D) and by domain analysis of ERα (AF2 and DBD but not AF1 bind to hADA3; Fig. 1E). It is noteworthy that, similar to binding to ERα, hADA3 also binds to ERβ (Fig. 1F). Taken together, these results demonstrate a clear binding of ER to mouse and human ADA3 and show that the ER-binding domain resides in the N-terminal portion of the protein. ERα Associates with hADA3 and mADA3 in Vivo—In view of the in vitro binding described above, we used co-immunoprecipitation analyses of transfected proteins to assess whether hADA3 and mADA3 associate with ERα in mammalian cells. For this purpose, we transfected His-tagged hADA3 (Fig. 2A) or mADA3 (Fig. 2B) together with FLAG-tagged ERα in 293T cells, affinity purified hADA3 on His-Bind resin, and assessed the presence of any associated FLAG-ERα using anti-FLAG immunoblotting. A clear association of hADA3 as well as mADA3 with ERα was seen in the absence as well as the presence of E2 (Fig. 2, A and B, top, lanes 6 and 12). Anti-His immunoblotting showed His-ADA3 expression in the appropriate lanes (Fig. 2, A and B, bottom). Likewise, immunoblotting of the cell lysates showed the expected expression of the transfected proteins. Taken together, our results demonstrate a ligand-independent association of hADA3 or mADA3 with ERα in a human cell system. hADA3 Is Present in Activator Complexes Bound to the ERE of Native pS2 Promoter—A crucial aspect of the coactivator function involves their ability to assemble into complexes with transcriptional activators bound to specific promoters in the context of the native chromatin (27Hsiao P.W. Deroo B.J. Archer T.K. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 80: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 28Dilworth F.J. Chambon P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3047-3054Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). To directly assess whether hADA3 is assembled into transcriptional activator complexes bound to a native estrogen-response element, we used the ChIP analysis of the estrogen-responsive pS2 promoter. For ChIP analysis, MCF-7, an estrogen-dependent breast cancer cell line, was either mock-treated or treated with 100 nm E2 for 24 h and native chromatin-associated protein complexes were cross-linked to the DNA. The chromatin immunoprecipitations were carried out with pre-immune (negative control), anti-hADA3, anti-ERα, and anti-p300 (positive controls) antibodies, and the associated DNA was used as a template for the PCR amplification of the pS2 promoter sequences incorporating a known ERE (29Spyr"

Azole drugs such as FLC and itraconazole, which target lanosterol 14α-demethylase and block the synthesis of ergosterol, are well tolerated and widely used in the treatment of fungal disease. They are, however, fungistatic substrates of pleiotropic drug resistance (PDR) family ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, and resistant fungi that overexpress these pumps are frequently isolated in the clinic (3Lupetti A.

The C. glabrata PDR family ABC transporters Cdr1p and Pdh1p, which efflux azole agents and structurally unrelated compounds, are among the primary causes of the intrinsic resistance of C. glabrata to azole drugs (4Miyazaki H.

The two pumps have >70% amino acid sequence identity and transport a similar spectrum of substrates, but Cdr1p had greater drug efflux activity for most substrates. Structural information on fungal single subunit ABC transporters is rudimentary, and the molecular and regulatory features that determine their enzyme activity and substrate specificity are poorly understood. Such information is required for the rational design of pump inhibitors and antifungal drugs that are not pump substrates. There are few reports of the effects of post-translational modification on the activity of fungal ABC transporters. Serine 420, a casein kinase-dependent phosphorylation site that determines Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pdr5p turnover (9Decottignies A. Owsianik G. Ghislain M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37139-37146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), is the only experimentally proven fungal ABC transporter phosphorylation site. We have shown that the ATPase activity of Cdr1p and the drug efflux activity of Pdh1p are regulated by phosphorylation (7Wada S. Niimi M. Niimi K. Holmes A.R. Monk B.C. Cannon R.D. Uehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46809-46821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Cdr1p cannot be phosphorylated at the position equivalent to Ser420, whereas Pdh1p phosphorylation was regulated by protein kinase A (PKA) at one or more sites not homologous to Pdr5p Ser420. More than one type of phosphorylation therefore occurs in fungal PDR family pumps. This report describes the differential regulation of C. glabrata Cdr1p and Pdh1p expressed in S. cerevisiae. Immunological, physiological, and biochemical methods were applied to site-directed mutants in putative phosphorylation sites and to kinase-deletion mutants. PKA catalytic subunit isoforms differentially affected pump phosphorylation, and the effects of the phosphorylation of two putative novel sites in Cdr1p were determined. A phosphorylation site adjacent to the Cdr1p ABC signature motif in nucleotide binding domain 1 (NBD1) affected the extent of multidrug efflux and the in vitro stability of ATPase activity while mutation of another cytoplasmic site nearer the membrane diminished transport at low glucose concentrations. Mutation in both sites eliminated the pumping activity of Cdr1p, whereas intragenic suppressors obtained by exposing the double mutant to FLC partially restored pump function. The Cdr1p NBD1 is a functional sensor of cell physiology and stress that may regulate interactions between homodimers. Yeast Strains and Growth Media—Growth and selection media, and the methods used to prepare and mutate S. cerevisiae strains expressing Pdh1p and Cdr1p, are described in the Supplemental Data section. Drug Susceptibility Assays—Agar diffusion assays on YPD (Qbiogene, Irvine, CA) agar plates, microplate MIC assays in HEPES and MES-buffered CSM (Qbiogene, Inc.) were performed, and the drugs and chemical compounds used were obtained as previously described (7Wada S.

ATPase Assay—Purified plasma membrane fractions were prepared from cells grown in YPD to early stationary phase (A600 nm = 7.0–9.0) and oligomycin-sensitive ATPase activities of samples were measured as previously described (7Wada S.

Fluorometric Assay of Rhodamine 6G Efflux—Log phase (A600 nm = 1.5) cells grown in CSM-URA (Qbiogene, Inc., Irvine, CA) medium were stored overnight on ice. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with distilled water, and then incubated in HEPES buffer (50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.0) containing 5 mm 2-deoxyglucose at 30 °C for 30 min to deplete intracellular energy levels. The cells were preloaded with 15 μm Rh6G for 30 min, washed twice, and resuspended in HEPES buffer at A600 nm = 15 (1.5 × 108 cells ml-1). Cell samples (50 μl) were incubated at 30 °C for 5 min and 50 μl of glucose at twice the final concentration added to start the reaction. After 8 min the cells in 80-μl samples were removed by passage through a Multi-well Filter plate (Acro Prep, Pall Corp.) placed on a Multiscreen resist vacuum manifold (Millipore), with a 96-well black flat-bottom microtiter collection plate (BMG Labtechnologies GmbH, Offenburg, Germany) underneath. The Rh6G content of the eluate, combined with two 80-μl washes with ice-cold HEPES buffer, was quantitated using a POLARstar OPTIMA (BMG Labtechnologies) fluorometer (excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 and 520 nm, respectively) with Fluostar OPTIMA software and a standard curve of Rh6G in the HEPES buffer. Antibodies Recognizing Cdr1p or Pdh1p Phosphorylations—We have previously described the S. cerevisiae strains CDR1-AD and PDH1-AD, which contain a mutant Pdr1p transcriptional regulator and thus constitutively heterologously hyperexpress Cdr1p and Pdh1p, respectively, from the PDR5 promoter (7Wada S.

Cdr1p and Pdh1p were hyperexpressed at comparable levels (∼10% of plasma membrane protein) and were readily distinguished as heterologous plasma membrane proteins on Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels due to the deletion of seven similar-sized, endogenous pump proteins. Each strain also showed the expected high level resistance to azole drugs (7Wada S. Niimi M. Niimi K. Holmes A.R. Monk B.C. Cannon R.D. Uehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46809-46821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The pumps heterologously expressed in S. cerevisiae were therefore correctly folded and should be post-translationally regulated as in C. glabrata, because these two closely related yeasts have similar intracellular molecular machinery. The phosphorylation of both Cdr1p and Pdh1p was detected by 32P labeling, but the signals were too weak to support more detailed experiments. Neither Cdr1p nor Pdh1p reacted with phospho-protein kinase C substrates antibody or phospho-tyrosine antibodies (7Wada S. Niimi M. Niimi K. Holmes A.R. Monk B.C. Cannon R.D. Uehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46809-46821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). An anti-phospho-(Ser/Thr) PKA substrate (p-PKAs) antibody detected phosphorylation of Pdh1p but not Cdr1p or background ABC transporters in Western blots of plasma membrane preparations (Fig. 1). Antibodies with different specificities detected novel phosphorylation sites in Cdr1p and Pdh1p. The anti-phospho-Akt substrate (p-Akts) and anti-phospho-threonine (p-Thr) antibodies recognized the phosphorylation of Cdr1p and Pdh1p expressed in all growth phases of YPD culture (Fig. 1, black arrowheads). Cdr1p expression in CDR1-AD decreased slightly in stationary phase (Fig. 1, CBB staining), whereas the p-Akts antibody recognition signal increased. Conversely, the p-Thr antibody gave a stronger signal in the log phase preparation. Cdr1p is therefore multiply phosphorylated at discrete p-Akts and p-Thr antibody recognition sites. Pdh1p phosphorylation in the PDH1-AD strain was readily detected by the p-PKAs, p-Akts, and p-Thr antibodies, with constant signals obtained throughout all growth phases of YPD culture. The recognition of the 100-kDa protein, which co-migrates with the constitutively expressed plasma membrane ATPase Pma1p (Fig. 1, white arrowheads) by the three antibodies provided an internal control for both the CDR1-AD and PDH1-AD preparations. Glucose-sensitive Phosphorylation of Pdh1p and Cdr1p—We previously found that the Cdr1p and Pdh1p pumps were extensively dephosphorylated after a few hours of glucose starvation and immediately rephosphorylated when 2% glucose was added (7Wada S. Niimi M. Niimi K. Holmes A.R. Monk B.C. Cannon R.D. Uehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46809-46821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The glucose concentration dependence of each rephosphorylation was therefore determined (Fig. 2A). Early stationary phase YPD cultures were glucose-starved for 3.5 h and then treated for 10 min with 10 μm, 1 mm, or 100 mm glucose. Rephosphorylation of Cdr1p was detected with p-Akts and p-Thr antibodies, but only after exposure to 100 mm glucose. Pdh1p remained partially phosphorylated after glucose starvation, but all three antibodies detected glucose-dependent rephosphorylation at a glucose concentration (10 μm) that failed to induce Pma1p phosphorylation. The different phosphorylation patterns detected with each antibody indicated that Pdh1p was also rephosphorylated at multiple sites. The >100-fold differential in the glucose-dependence of Cdr1p and Pdh1p phosphorylation suggested that the two pumps were modified by different kinases/phosphatases or had sites with different susceptibilities to phosphorylation. Pdh1p phosphorylation at p-PKAs sites is inhibited by PKA inhibitors (7Wada S. Niimi M. Niimi K. Holmes A.R. Monk B.C. Cannon R.D. Uehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46809-46821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A panel of PKA catalytic subunit (Tpk) single and double deletion mutants was used to identify the TPK gene product that regulated Pdh1p phosphorylation in PDH1-AD. The three genes (TPK1, -2, and -3) encoding these PKA catalytic subunit isoforms can be deleted without lethality, either singly or up to two at a time (11Toda T. Cameron S. Sass P. Zoller M. Wigler M. Cell. 1987; 50: 277-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). In YPD culture, identical Pdh1p phosphorylation signals were observed, even in the double deletion mutants PDH1-TPK1Δ2Δ, -TPK1Δ3Δ, and -TPK2Δ3Δ (Fig. 2B). In contrast, rephosphorylation at the PKA and Akt sites was not induced by 10 μm glucose in PDH1-TPK2Δ3Δ, and PKA site rephosphorylation was dramatically decreased in PDH1-TPK1Δ3Δ (Fig. 2B). Thus Tpk3p was the main contributor to glucose-dependent rephosphorylation of Pdh1p PKA and Akts sites at low glucose concentrations, and only Tpk2p could augment this process. Stress Sensitivity of Cdr1p and Pdh1p Phosphorylation—The glucose-dependent differences in Cdr1p and Pdh1p rephosphorylation patterns suggested that the two pumps might be phosphorylated in discrete physiological contexts. This hypothesis was initially tested for Cdr1p rephosphorylation in glucose-starved CDR1-AD by adding 1 mm glucose together with a stressor for 10 min (Fig. 3A). The 1 mm glucose supplied sufficient ATP as kinase substrate, because the Pma1p band was strongly phosphorylated even in the absence of Akt site phosphorylation of Cdr1p (Figs. 2A and 3A). The pump substrate FLC (45 μg/ml) did not affect rephosphorylation (data not shown), but oxidative stress (2 mm H2O2), osmotic stress (500 mm NaCl), and heat shock (42 °C) for 10 min induced p-Akt site phosphorylation, albeit to a lesser extent than 100 mm glucose (Fig. 3A). Stress-dependent rephosphorylation was not detected with the p-Thr antibody. Pdh1p in PDH1-AD was highly phosphorylated in 1 mm glucose, and stress treatments caused no additional phosphorylation. In contrast, stress with 2 mm H2O2 alone decreased Pdh1p phosphorylation and gave no rephosphorylation of Cdr1p. However, Cdr1p phosphorylation was not affected when the yeast in YPD culture were stressed (H2O2, NaCl, or 42 °C) for 10 min (data not shown). Under these conditions, the effects of multiple kinases and phosphatases may have been complex and/or compensatory.Table IAntifungal susceptibilities of CDR1-AD and PDH1-AD derivative strainsStrainMIC80aMIC80 values (μg/ml) were the lowest concentration of drug that inhibited the growth yield by at least 80% compared with the growth yield for a non-drug controlFluconazoleMiconazoleKetoconazoleFlucytosineAmphotericin Bμg/mlpSK-AD0.50.0160.0630.50.25CDR1-AD1282420.5CDR1-M1642410.5CDR1-M21282410.5CDR1-M31282410.5CDR1-M41282410.5CDR1-M51282410.5CDR1-M61282410.5CDR1-M71282410.5CDR1-M81282410.5CDR1-M91282410.5CDR1-M1,2321210.5CDR1-TPK1Δ1282420.5CDR1-TPK2Δ2564820.5CDR1-TPK3Δ1282420.5CDR1-TPK1Δ2Δ2564420.5CDR1-TPK1Δ3Δ1282421CDR1-TPK2Δ3Δ2564810.25CDR1-SCH9Δ256480.250.25CDR1-HOG1Δ2564821PDH1-AD160.5110.5PDH1-TPK1Δ160.5110.5PDH1-TPK2Δ160.5110.5PDH1-TPK3Δ160.5111PDH1-TPK1Δ2Δ161120.5PDH1-TPK1Δ3Δ160.5121PDH1-TPK2Δ3Δ160.5110.5a MIC80 values (μg/ml) were the lowest concentration of drug that inhibited the growth yield by at least 80% compared with the growth yield for a non-drug control Open table in a new tab Fig. 1Phosphorylation of Cdr1p and Pdh1p.

Watanabe M. Kobayashi R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 328-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), or the protein kinase C inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I (BIM) (Fig. 3B). A panel of TPK single or double deletion mutants constructed in CDR1-AD was tested for the effects of NaCl- and glucose-dependent rephosphorylation of Cdr1p (Fig. 3C). Apart from CDR1-TPK1Δ2Δ and CDR1-TPK2Δ3Δ, which reduced Cdr1p rephosphorylation by about 50% during both treatments, p-Akts site re-phosphorylation was unaffected. Thus Tpk2p and to a lesser extent Tpk1p and Tpk3p may play a role with other kinases susceptible to PKA inhibitors in the rephosphorylation of Cdr1p Akts sites. Identification of Putative Phosphorylation Sites in Cdr1p— Modest rephosphorylation signals suggested the presence of few p-Akts sites in Cdr1p. The p-Akts antibody recognizes phosphorylated Ser or Thr in the -5(K/R)X-3(K/R)XX0(S/T) motif and cross-reacts with the phosphorylated -3(K/R)-2(K/R)X0(S/T) motif (manufacturer's information). The full size, single subunit, ABC transporter Cdr1p comprises two nucleotide binding domains (NBD1 and NBD2) that each contain the Walker A, Walker B, and ABC signature motifs, alternating with two pairs of six transmembrane segments, as illustrated in Fig. 4A. We constructed the yeast strains CDR1-M1 to CDR1-M9, which expressed equivalent amounts of Cdr1p (Fig. 4B), and each contained a point mutation (S/T → A) at each one of the nine putative p-Akts recognition sites. Of these sites, only M2, M4, and M7 may be recognized by the phospho-PKA substrates antibody (phosphorylated Ser or Thr in RXX(S/T)). Unlike the essentially normal phosphorylation of Cdr1p p-Akts sites in the CDR1-M3-CDR1-M9 mutants in 12-h YPD (early stationary phase) cultures, Cdr1p phosphorylation was eliminated in CDR1-M1 and >90% inhibited in CDR1-M2 (Fig. 4B). Rephosphorylation of Cdr1p-M1 and Cdr1p-M2 was not detected in response to stressors plus 1 mm glucose (Fig. 4, C and D), and 100 mm glucose gave rephosphorylation to about 50% of the control level in each mutant (Fig. 4D). These results suggested that Ser307 and Ser484 are the dominant Akts sites in Cdr1p. This hypothesis was confirmed by finding, in the S307A/S484A double mutant strain CDR1-M1,2, that 100 mm glucose gave no Cdr1p p-Akts site rephosphorylation (Fig. 4E). Thus, the phosphorylation of M1 and M2 sites responded comparably to 12-h YPD culture (low glucose) and stressors, whereas glucose-induced rephosphorylation of the two sites occurred independently. Interestingly, the S307A mutation of the M1 site mutation reduced Thr phosphorylation by one-third in 12-h YPD cultures (Fig. 4B), and the S509A mutation at the membrane-associated M3 site similarly affected Akts site rephosphorylation of Cdr1p in 100 mm glucose (Fig. 4E). Rhodamine 6G Efflux from Pdh1p, Cdr1p, and Point Mutant Yeast—The effect of the M1 and M2 mutations on energy-dependent drug efflux by Cdr1p was quantitated by comparably pre-loading CDR1-AD, CDR1-M1, CDR1-M2, CDR1-M1,2 and AD1–8u- cells with the pump substrate rhodamine 6G (Rh6G) after 2-deoxyglucose treatment and then stimulating efflux by adding glucose (Fig. 5). Fluorometric measurements showed that the CDR1-M2 strain (half-maximal rate of Rh6G pumping, 2.5 mm glucose; maximal pumping rate, 5–10 mm glucose) pumped Rh6G at rates up to 80% of the CDR1-AD strain (half-maximal rate of Rh6G pumping, 1 mm glucose; maximal rate, 5–10 mm glucose). In contrast, the CDR1-M1 strain required at least 5 mm glucose for a significant rate of Rh6G efflux and reached a maximal rate at 20 mm glucose, which was only 30% that of the CDR1-AD strain. The CDR1-M1,2 strain showed no glucose-dependent Rh6G efflux, even at 100 mm glucose. All strains that effluxed Rh6G showed a 30% decrease in the pumping rate at glucose concentrations between 20 and 100 mm glucose. The pumping activities of Cdr1p and its point mutants were confirmed by flow cytometric measurement of cellular Rh6G content, which monitors combined dye uptake and efflux (see Supplemental Data, Fig. S1). These data also showed that strain CDR1-M1,2 did not efflux Rh6G even in the presence of 100 mm glucose and that phosphorylation of the Cdr1p-M1 site may be required for Rh6G efflux at low glucose concentrations. Lability of ATPase Activity in CDR1-M1—The Cdr1p drug efflux pumps were functional in CDR1-M1, CDR1-M2, and CDR1-M8 cells and therefore expected to retain significant ATPase activity on cell fractionation. Plasma membrane fractions from these strains contained equivalent amounts of Cdr1p proteins, CDR1-M8 had a normal oligomycin-sensitive ATPase activity with a broad pH profile, but CDR1-M2 showed a decrease of ∼50% in the ATPase activity compared with CDR1-AD (Fig. 6). CDR1-M8 was chosen as a control, because the T1007A mutation borders the NBD2 ABC signature motif residue and aligns with Ser307 of NBD1. The membranes from CDR1-M1, however, lacked detectable oligomycin-sensitive ATPase activity. The M1 site may therefore be critical for the in vitro ATPase activity. Experiments that included ATP during membrane isolation allowed the recovery of small amounts (10%) of vanadate and oligomycin-sensitive ATPase activity compared with the control strain (see Supplemental Data Table SIII). A statistically significant proportion of this activity (p < 0.01) can be attributed to S307A Cdr1p that survived membrane isolation due to the protective ATP. Drug Susceptibilities of CDR1-AD and PDH1-AD Derivative Yeasts—The MIC80 values for antifungal agents were determined for PDH1-AD and CDR1-AD derivative strains to assess whether the phosphorylation of Cdr1p and Pdh1p affected drug efflux activity (Table I). As expected, the Pdh1p- and Cdr1p-expressing strains were more resistant to azole agents than the control pSK-AD strain but were equally susceptible to flucytosine and amphotericin B, which are not pump substrates. The flucytosine and amphotericin B susceptibilities for all the strains were within two dilutions of the values for pSK-AD. Among the CDR1-AD derivatives, only CDR1-M1 and CDR1-M1,2 consist"
https://openalex.org/W1963697475,"Human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1) transcription is regulated by a virus-encoded protein, Tat, which forms a complex with a host cellular factor, positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb). When this complex binds to TAR RNA synthesized from the HIV-1 long terminal repeat promoter element, transcription is trans-activated. In this study we showed that, in host cells, HIV-1 transcription is negatively regulated by competition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) with Tat·P-TEFb for binding to TAR RNA. PARP-1, which has a high affinity for TAR RNA (KD = 1.35 × 10-10m), binds to the loop region of TAR RNA and displaces Tat or Tat·P-TEFb from the RNA. In vitro transcription assays showed that this displacement leads to suppression of Tat-mediated trans-activation of transcription. Furthermore in vivo expression of luciferase or destabilized enhanced green fluorescent protein genes under the control of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat promoter was suppressed by PARP-1. Thus, these results suggest that PARP-1 acts as a negative regulator of HIV-1 transcription through competitive binding with Tat or the Tat·P-TEFb complex to TAR RNA.

This 59-bp RNA stem-loop is transcribed from a promoter located within the long terminal repeat (LTR) element by RNA polymerase II (Pol II). The synthesis of TAR RNA, however, stalls Pol II, resulting in the production of non-processive RNA transcripts (1Cullen B.R.

To rescue the stalled Pol II, Tat binds to a uracil-rich bulge in TAR RNA (+22 to +24) (3Zhou Q. Chen D. Pierstorff E. Luo K.

This binding is stabilized by the interaction of Tat with a host cellular factor, positive transcription elongation factor (P-TEFb) (3Zhou Q. Chen D. Pierstorff E. Luo K.

As HIV-1 can establish a latent infection, HIV-1 transcription is also thought to be negatively regulated in host cells, although the molecular mechanisms of the negative regulation remain to be elucidated. However, several factors that might be involved in this negative regulation have been identified, one being 7SK RNA, an abundant small nuclear RNA (13Zieve G. Penman S. Cell. 1976; 8: 19-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 14Wassarman D.A. Steitz J.A. Mol. Cell.

Nature. 2001; 414: 322-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 16Yang Z. Zhu Q. Luo K. Zhou Q.

Thus, the 7SK RNA is likely to have a negative regulatory role in HIV-1 gene expression (15Nguyen V.T. Kiss T. Michels A.A. Bensaude O. Nature. 2001; 414: 322-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 16Yang Z. Zhu Q. Luo K. Zhou Q. Nature. 2001; 414: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Another identified factor is 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole sensitivity-inducing factor (DSIF), comprising the two subunits hSpt5 and hSpt4 (17Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y. Ferdous A. Imai T. Hirose S. Sugimoto S. Yano K. Hartzog G.A. Winston F. Buratowski S. Handa H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 343-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole sensitivity-inducing factor acts in concert with negative elongation factor (NELF) to suppress transcription at the level of elongation (18Yamaguchi Y.

Cell. 1999; 97: 41-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar) and is suggested to be involved in suppression of HIV-1 transcription (19Ping Y.H. Rana T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12951-12958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In addition to these factors, we have previously found evidence (20Vispe S. Yung T.M.C. Ritchot J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 11279-11286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) suggesting that the abundant nuclear enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) might act as a negative regulator of HIV-1 transcription. PARP-1 is an enzyme known to bind to DNA breaks and to subsequently catalyze a post-translational modification of various proteins with ADP-ribose polymers (22Cleaver J.E. Morgan W.F. Mutat. Res. 1991; 257: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 23D'Amours D. Desnoyers S. D'Silva I. Poirier G.G. Biochem.

Springer-Verlag, Berlin1987Crossref Google Scholar). PARP-1 molecules have three major domains: DNA binding, automodification, and catalytic domains (22Cleaver J.E. Morgan W.F. Mutat. Res. 1991; 257: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 25Ménissier-de Murcia G. Murcia J. Schreiber V. Bioessays. 1991; 13: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The DNA binding domain, located at the N-terminal end of PARP-1, contains two homologous zinc finger motifs (25Ménissier-de Murcia G. Murcia J. Schreiber V. Bioessays. 1991; 13: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), which possess a high binding affinity for DNA breaks (26D'Silva I. Pelletier J.D. Lagueux J. D'Amours D. Chaudhry M.A. Weinfeld M. Lees-Miller S.P. Poirier G.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1430: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that the zinc finger motifs also bind to various RNA stem-loops, including those in TAR RNA (21Yung T.M.C. Satoh M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11279-11286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Although the specific TAR RNA substructure recognized by PARP-1 is not yet known, it is plausible that, if the binding site of PARP-1 on TAR RNA is in close proximity to that of Tat·P-TEFb, PARP-1 may compete with Tat·P-TEFb in binding to TAR RNA, leading to HIV-1 transcription suppression. To test this hypothesis, we studied the effects of the binding of PARP-1 to TAR RNA on Tat-mediated trans-activation of transcription. We showed that PARP-1 binds to the loop region of TAR RNA with high affinity (KD of 1.35 × 10-10m), even higher than the binding affinity of Tat·P-TEFb for TAR RNA (10Zhang J. Tamilarasu N. Hwang S. Garber M.E. Huq I. Jones K.A. Rana T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34314-34319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, PARP-1 is able to displace Tat·P-TEFb from TAR RNA. In addition, PARP-1 suppressed Tat-mediated trans-activation of transcription in cell-free transcription assays. Furthermore, using in vivo luciferase (Luc) reporter assays, we observed a similar suppression in Tat-mediated trans-activation of transcription by PARP-1. Using a stable cell line expressing Tat and destabilized enhanced green fluorescent protein (d1EGFP) under the control of HIV-1 LTR, we found that PARP-1 was able to suppress the expression of d1EGFP in vivo. Thus, our results suggest that PARP-1 is, to the best of our knowledge, the first identified host cellular factor that negatively regulates HIV-1 transcription by directly competing with Tat·P-TEFb for binding to TAR RNA.

After digestion of these plasmids with HindIII, uniformly 32P-labeled TAR RNA, M-TAR RNA, and stem-loop RNA were prepared as described previously (20Vispe S. Yung T.M.C. Ritchot J. Serizawa H. Satoh M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9886-9891Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).

A biotinylated single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (ssBI; 100 ng/ml, 20 bases in length), dissolved in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5.0 mm EDTA, and 0.01% Nonidet P-40 (BI buffer), was immobilized onto streptavidin-coated biosensor tips (SA5) at a flow rate of 30 ml/min. Then a 53-base-long single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) or TAR RNA was synthesized with a complementary sequence to the ssBI by T3 RNA polymerase (21Yung T.M.C. Satoh M.S. J. Biol.

Tat or PARP-1 was dissolved in BI buffer, and the interaction of Tat or PARP-1 with TAR RNA was measured by applying the protein or enzyme to sensor tips at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Association and dissociation constants were determined with BIA Evaluation Version 3.1 (BIACORE). Competition of PARP-1 with Tat or Tat·P-TEFb in TAR RNA Binding—TAR RNA·Tat complexes were preformed by incubation of 300 pmol of Tat, 50 fmol of [32P]TAR RNA, and 0.5 μg of anti-Tat antibody (NT3 2D1.1 (29Dingwall C.

The protein G-Sepharose was then washed twice with 10 μl of C buffer. Then 14 μl of C buffer containing 0.2 mm ZnCl2 was incubated with the protein G-Sepharose in the presence or absence of P-TEFb (20 ng), which was prepared as described previously (30Wada T. Takagi T.

The expected sizes of the run-off products from linearized pHIV-1/LTR/Luc and pCMV/Luc were 674 and 680 bases, respectively. After termination of the reaction and purification of transcripts, RNA was fractionated on a 5 or 10% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gel. After gel drying, 32P activity was visualized by autoradiography. Western Blotting—Western blots were done using anti-hSpt 5 (17Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y. Ferdous A. Imai T. Hirose S. Sugimoto S. Yano K. Hartzog G.A. Winston F. Buratowski S. Handa H.

Chem. 2001; 276: 11279-11286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Instead of p31, pcDNA 3.1/24 kDa (a mammalian expression construct of the N-terminal 24-kDa fragment of PARP-1) or pcDNA 3.1/89 kDa (a mammalian expression construct of the C-terminal 89-kDa fragment of PARP-1) was also used. Cells were cultured for 24 h and were then lysed. Luc activity was measured using a Luc assay kit (Promega). pHIV-1/LTR ΔTAR/Luc, in which the sequence corresponding to TAR was removed by SacI-HindIII digestion of pHIV-1/LTR/Luc was also used. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted with a Promega RNA extraction kit. 32P-Labeled probes for Luc mRNA were prepared from pHIV-1/LTR/Luc, and Northern blot analysis was carried out using a standard method. RNA Protection Assay—pHIV-1/LTR/Luc was digested with XbaI, and the fragment containing the sequence for TAR RNA and the following 5′ portion of the Luc gene were cloned into pBluescript K/S+. A 32P-labeled antisense probe complementary to the sequence from +1 to +156 was synthesized by T3 RNA polymerase. An RNA protection assay was carried out using the RPA III kit (Ambion). Protected fragments were fractionated on a 10% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gel and visualized by autoradiography. Establishment of Cells Constitutively Expressing d1EGFP— pd1EGFP-N1, containing d1EGFP under the control of a CMV promoter, was purchased from Clontech. The CMV promoter was then replaced with the HIV-1 LTR to construct the pd1EGFP-LTR. HeLa-tat-III cells were transfected with pd1EGFP-N1 or pd1EGFP-LTR to create HeLa-tat-III/CMV/d1EGFP and HeLa-tat-III/LTR/d1EGFP cells, respectively. The cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose containing 10% fetal bovine serum, antibiotics, and 1 mg/ml G418; cells were cloned from the resulting colonies. Expression of d1EGFP was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy. Transfection of pPARP-1-DsRed and Confocal Microscopy—HeLa-tat-III/CMV/d1EGFP or HeLa-tat-III/LTR/d1EGFP cells were seeded in Delta T4 culture dishes (Bioptechs) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Then either pPARP-1-DsRed (1.5 μg/ml), a mammalian expression construct for PARP-1 tagged with red fluorescent protein (DsRed), or p24kDa-DsRed, a mammalian expression construct for the N-terminal 24-kDa PARP-1 fragment tagged with DsRed (35Yung T.M.C.

The cells were grown for another 48 h. Images taken through a 60× 1.4 numerical aperture objective were captured by a FLUOVIEW FV300 confocal laser scanning unit (Olympus). For multiple channel imaging, fluorescence from each channel was imaged sequentially to eliminate cross-talk between the channels. A 488 nm argon ion laser line was used to excite d1EGFP with fluorescence being imaged using a 570 nm beamsplitter and the combination of a 510–530 nm bandpass excitation filter and 510 nm long pass emission filter. DsRed was exited with a 543 nm helium-neon laser line, and the fluorescence was imaged using a 570 nm beamsplitter and a 575–630 nm bandpass emission filter. In this configuration, cross-talk between d1EGFP and DsRed was kept below detectable limits (35Yung T.M.C. Sato S. Satoh M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39686-39696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Green and red colored images were created by FLUOVIEW 300 Version 3.3 software (Olympus). The expression level of d1EGFP was determined using Photoshop Version 6.0 software. PARP-1 and RNA—PARP-1 has the ability to bind various types of RNA stem-loops, including TAR RNA (20Vispe S.

Satoh M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9886-9891Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 21Yung T.M.C. Satoh M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11279-11286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), PARP-1 reduced the mobility of TAR RNA on a native polyacrylamide gel and formed a single retarding band (Fig. 1A, TAR RNA). Even when the loop sequence of TAR RNA was altered (M-TAR RNA), a single retarding band was still found (Fig. 1A, M-TAR RNA), suggesting that PARP-1 recognizes the stem-loop structure itself and not the loop sequence. To determine whether PARP-1 binds to the loop or stem region, we then prepared an RNA stem-loop that did not contain mismatches in the stem region (Fig. 1B, Stem-loop). Then we carried out gel retardation assays with stem-loop RNA that was or was not treated with RNase T1, which digests ssRNA (Fig. 1B, Stem). As shown in Fig. 1B (Stem-loop), PARP-1 formed a single retarding band with the stem-loop RNA, while no obvious retardation was observed with the digested stem-loop (Fig. 1B, Stem). These results suggest that PARP-1 binds to the loop region of RNA stem-loops. Previously we demonstrated that PARP-1 forms two discrete retarding bands with RNA synthesized from the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (20Vispe S. Yung T.M.C. Ritchot J. Serizawa H. Satoh M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9886-9891Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This RNA contains two stem-loops, and thus the formation of two retarding bands is likely related to the number of stem-loops presented in the RNA. Thus, we then tested longer M-TAR RNA with an extra RNA stretch of 68 bases (M-TAR RNA+68). Based on the structure prediction using RNA Structure Version 3.1 (Scripps Institute), we found 10 putative ssRNA regions in M-TAR RNA+68. As described, only one retarding band was formed by incubating M-TAR RNA with PARP-1 (Fig. 1A), while the mobility of M-TAR RNA+68 further decreased with increasing amounts of PARP-1 (Fig. 1C). This retardation can be explained by the presence of multiple PARP-1 binding sites in M-TAR RNA+68. As PARP-1 also reduced the mobility of ssRNAs, including poly(A), poly(C), poly(U), and poly (G) (data not shown), these results suggest that PARP-1 has an affinity for ssRNA and thus recognizes loop regions of RNA stem-loops. Binding Affinity of PARP-1 for TAR RNA—Next we determined the equilibrium dissociation constant, KD, between PARP-1 and TAR RNA using a surface plasmon resonance biosensor. As a control, the KD between Tat and TAR RNA was also determined. Previously, using fluorescence resonance energy transfer, Zhang et al. (10Zhang J. Tamilarasu N. Hwang S. Garber M.E. Huq I. Jones K.A. Rana T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34314-34319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) showed that the KD between Tat and TAR RNA is 8.2 × 10-9m. The KD that we obtained using a surface plasmon resonance biosensor between Tat and TAR RNA was 3.01 × 10-9m (Fig. 2A). Thus, although our method showed a 2.7-fold lower KD than that obtained by fluorescence resonance energy transfer, our results are, overall, in agreement with the results obtained by Zhang et al. (10Zhang J. Tamilarasu N. Hwang S. Garber M.E. Huq I. Jones K.A. Rana T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34314-34319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We then determined the KD between PARP-1 and TAR RNA, which was 1.35 × 10-10m (Fig. 2B), showing that PARP-1 has an affinity for TAR RNA 22 times stronger than Tat. Zhang et al. (10Zhang J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 34314-34319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) reported that the affinity of Tat for TAR RNA increases about 10-fold after forming the Tat·P-TEFb complex. Even when taking this increase into account, PARP-1 still has a 2.2 times higher affinity for TAR RNA than does Tat·P-TEFb. Competition between PARP-1 and Tat or Tat·P-TEFb in Binding to TAR RNA—Binding of Tat·P-TEFb to TAR RNA primarily requires Tat recognition of a TAR RNA bulge region. Given that the bulge is located near the loop region (Fig. 1A), we next examined whether PARP-1 binding to TAR RNA inhibits Tat or Tat·P-TEFb binding to TAR RNA. As illustrated in Fig. 3A, [32P]TAR RNA was incubated with Tat in the presence of anti-Tat antibody (29Dingwall C. Ernberg I. Gait M.J. Green S.M. Heaphy S. Karn J. Lowe A.D. Singh M. Skinner M.A. Valerio R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6925-6929Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Then the anti-Tat antibody· Tat·[32P]TAR RNA complexes were precipitated with protein G-Sepharose. PARP-1 was added to the complexes under the presumption that if PARP-1 displaces Tat from the complexes, [32P]TAR RNA might be released. This predicted release of [32P]TAR RNA by PARP-1 (Fig. 3A) did in fact occur, suggesting that PARP-1 was able to displace Tat from TAR RNA. We then added P-TEFb to anti-Tat antibody·Tat·[32P]TAR RNA complexes to allow the formation of Tat·P-TEFb complexes and studied the effect of PARP-1 on the release of [32P]TAR RNA from these complexes. P-TEFb was previously reported to stabilize Tat·TAR RNA complexes by increasing the binding affinity of Tat by about 10-fold (10Zhang J. Tamilarasu N. Hwang S. Garber M.E. Huq I. Jones K.A. Rana T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34314-34319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Accordingly the addition of 0.8 pmol of PARP-1, which released more than 60% of [32P]TAR RNA from the anti-Tat antibody·Tat·[32P]TAR RNA complexes (Fig. 3B, Tat, 0 versus 0.8 pmol of PARP-1) only released 10% of the [32P]TAR RNA when the complexes were incubated with P-TEFb (Fig. 3B, Tat+P-TEFb, 0 versus 0.8 pmol of PARP-1). However, an increased amount of PARP-1 (2.0 pmol) resulted in a 75% release of [32P]TAR RNA (Fig. 3B, Tat+P-TEFb, 2.0 pmol of PARP-1). These results thus indicate that PARP-1 also has the ability to displace Tat·P-TEFb from TAR RNA. Suppression of Tat-promoted trans-Activation of Transcription by PARP-1 in Vitro—In cell-free transcription assays with HeLa nuclear extracts, the addition of Tat has been shown to have a promoting effect on transcription initiated from the HIV-1 LTR because of the formation of Tat·P-TEFb and trans-activation of transcription through its binding to TAR RNA (36Marciniak R.A.

Despite intensive study, the mechanisms by which lipoprotein(a) promotes these disorders remain to be unequivocally defined. It has been demonstrated that lipoprotein(a), through its unique constituent apolipoprotein(a) (apo(a)), stimulates vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) migration and proliferation. These effects arise from the ability of apo(a) to inhibit the formation of active transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) from its latent precursor, which in turn is caused by the ability of apo(a) to decrease the formation of plasmin from its precursor plasminogen. We utilized a battery of recombinant apo(a) variants that represent systematic deletions of the various domains in the molecule to further probe the mechanism underlying the effect of apo(a) on SMC responses. All recombinant apo(a) variants that contained kringle IV type 9 were able to stimulate SMC proliferation and migration and to decrease the formation of active TGF-β; conversely all recombinant apo(a) variants lacking kringle IV type 9 had no effect on these parameters. The kringle IV type 9-dependent effects of apo(a) on SMC proliferation required the presence of plasminogen, suggesting for the first time that this kringle mediates the ability of apo(a) to inhibit pericellular plasmin formation.

Lipidol. 2003; 14: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Despite intensive investigations, the true biological role of this lipoprotein and the mechanisms by which it exerts its pathogenic effects in vivo remain to be defined.Lp(a) consists of a lipoprotein moiety that is essentially indistinguishable from low density lipoprotein as well as the unique glycoprotein apolipoprotein(a) (apo(a)) (1Marcovina S.M. Koschinsky M.L. Albers J.J. Skarlatos S. Clin. Chem. 2003; 49: 1785-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 2Marcovina S.M. Koschinsky M.L. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2003; 14: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Apo(a) is covalently linked, via a single disulfide bond, to apolipoprotein B in the Lp(a) particle (3Koschinsky M.L. Côté G.P. Gabel B. van der Hoek Y.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19819-19825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Brunner C. Kraft H.G. Utermann G. Müller H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11643-11647Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Apo(a) bears a striking homology to plasminogen as it is composed of a large number of repeated motifs closely related to kringle 4 of plasminogen as well as single copy domains homologous to the kringle 5 and latent protease of plasminogen (5McLean J.W. Tomlinson J.E. Kuang W.J. Eaton D.L. Chen E.Y. Fless G.M. Scanu A.M. Lawn R.M. Nature. 1987; 330: 132-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar). Unlike plasminogen, however, apo(a) cannot be activated by plasminogen activators and lacks proteolytic activity (6Gabel B.R. Koschinsky M.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15777-15784Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).Thus, the pathogenic mechanisms of Lp(a) are generally assumed to arise from the dual homology of Lp(a) to low density lipoprotein and plasminogen. Indeed Lp(a) has been shown to accumulate in atherosclerotic plaques, to be able to contribute to foam cell formation, and to be able to inhibit fibrinolysis and hence exacerbate intravascular thrombosis (for reviews, see Refs. 2Marcovina S.M. Koschinsky M.L. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2003; 14: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar and 7Scanu A.M. Curr. Cardiol. Rep. 2001; 3: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, some effects of Lp(a) appear to be unique in that they do not appear to follow from the homology of this lipoprotein to low density lipoprotein or plasminogen.

An effect of Lp(a) that may be of particular significance to atherosclerotic disorders is the ability of this lipoprotein, through its apo(a) moiety, to inhibit the formation of active transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) (15Kojima S.

It has been demonstrated that this effect of Lp(a) and apo(a) stimulates vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) migration (15Kojima S. Harpel P.C. Rifkin D.B. J.

Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). However, inhibition of pericellular plasminogen activation by apo(a) has never been directly demonstrated. In addition, the domains in apo(a) that are responsible for its effects on SMC behavior remain to be defined.The plasminogen kringle 4-like domains in apo(a) are present in 10 types that differ in amino acid sequence (5McLean J.W.

Apo(a) kringle IV (KIV) types 1 and 3–10 are present in single copies in all apo(a) isoforms (19van der Hoek Y.Y. Wittekoek M.E. Beisiegel U. Kastelein J.J. Koschinsky M.L. Hum. Mol.

KIV type 2 is present in varying copy numbers (from 3 to >40) (21Marcovina S.M. Hobbs H.H. Albers J.J. Clin. Chem. 1996; 42: 436-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 22Kraft H.G.

Atherosclerosis. 1996; 125: 53-61Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), which gives rise to the Lp(a) isoform size variation observed in the human population. We utilized a battery of recombinant apo(a) variants in which individual domains are systematically deleted to define the sequences in apo(a) that mediate stimulation of smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration. We demonstrate a key role for apo(a) KIV9: this is the first report of a functional role for this kringle beyond mediating assembly with apolipoprotein B. The apparent requirement of this kringle for inhibition of pericellular plasminogen activation by apo(a) is in contrast to the domain requirements for inhibition by apo(a) of plasminogen activation on fibrin, suggesting different inhibitory paradigms in these two milieus.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression and Purification of Recombinant Apo(a) Variants—The recombinant apo(a) (r-apo(a)) variants used in this study are shown schematically in Fig. 1A. Details of the construction of the expression plasmids encoding the respective variants have been described previously: 17K (23Koschinsky M.L. Tomlinson J.E. Zioncheck T.F. Schwartz K. Eaton D.L.

All expression plasmids were constructed in the pRK5 vector (23Koschinsky M.L. Tomlinson J.E. Zioncheck T.F. Schwartz K. Eaton D.L. Lawn R.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5044-5051Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), which contains the cytomegalovirus promoter and SV40 transcription termination signal. An expression plasmid encoding apo(a) KIV types 1–4 (KIV1–4) was constructed as follows. The expression plasmid pRK5ha17 (encoding 17K) (23Koschinsky M.L. Tomlinson J.E. Zioncheck T.F. Schwartz K. Eaton D.L. Lawn R.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5044-5051Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) was digested with EcoRI and SalI to excise the apo(a) cDNA. The insert was replaced by an EcoRI/SmaI fragment (encoding the apo(a) signal sequence, KIV1, eight copies of KIV2, KIV3, and all but the last 4 amino acids of KIV4) and an EcoRV/SalI fragment (encoding the last 4 amino acids of KV and the entire protease domain but containing a stop codon after KV) in a three-part ligation.Stable cell lines expressing the respective r-apo(a) variants were generated in human embryonic kidney (293) cells as described previously (23Koschinsky M.L. Tomlinson J.E. Zioncheck T.F. Schwartz K. Eaton D.L. Lawn R.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5044-5051Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). For expression of recombinant proteins, stable lines were grown in OptiMEM (Invitrogen); conditioned medium containing r-apo(a) was collected every 48 h. All r-apo(a) variants, with the exception of KIV1–4, were purified from conditioned medium using lysine-Sepharose affinity chromatography as follows. Conditioned medium was passed over a 50-ml lysine-Sepharose column equilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5 m NaCl, and the column was then washed with this buffer. Specific elution of r-apo(a) was accomplished using phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5 m NaCl and 0.2 m ϵ-aminocaproic acid. Protein-containing fractions were pooled, dialyzed extensively against 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl at 4 °C, and concentrated with polyethylene glycol 20,000. The purified proteins were aliquoted and stored at –70 °C.The r-apo(a) variant KIV1–4 was purified by lectin-Sepharose affinity chromatography followed by gel filtration chromatography. Briefly, conditioned medium was applied to a 50-ml lectin-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 m NaCl. The column was washed with this buffer, and KIV1–4 was eluted with this buffer containing 0.5 m N-acetyl-d-glucosamine. Protein fractions containing KIV1–4 were pooled and concentrated with polyethylene glycol 20,000. The concentrated sample was then subjected to gel filtration chromatography on a Sepharose 4B column developed with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl. Fractions containing KIV1–4 were pooled, dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl at 4 °C, and concentrated with polyethylene glycol 20,000. The purified protein was aliquoted and stored at –70 °C.The protein concentrations for each r-apo(a) variant were determined by absorbance measurements at 280 nm (corrected for Rayleigh scattering) using the following molecular weights and extinction coefficients: 17K: molecular weight = 278,719, ϵ1%(280 nm) = 2.07; 17K(D56A): molecular weight = 278,719, ϵ1%(280 nm) = 2.07; 17KΔP: molecular weight = 249,244, ϵ1%(280 nm) = 2.2; KIV5–P: molecular weight = 122,542, ϵ1%(280 nm) = 2.56; KIV1–4: molecular weight = 156,177, ϵ1%(280 nm) = 2.0; KIV5–8: molecular weight = 56,000, ϵ1%(280 nm) = 2.1; KIV5–9: molecular weight = 70,000, ϵ1%(280 nm) = 2.1; KIV5–10: molecular weight = 84,802, ϵ1%(280 nm) = 2.02; KIV8–P: molecular weight = 80,022, ϵ1%(280 nm) = 2.34; KIV9–P: molecular weight = 66,117, ϵ1%(280 nm) = 2.28; and KIV10–P: molecular weight = 52,040, ϵ1%(280 nm) = 2.16. The purity of the r-apo(a) variants was determined by SDS-PAGE (1 μg of protein/lane) on a 4–20% polyacrylamide gradient gel under non-reducing conditions followed by staining with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 1B).Smooth Muscle Cell Culture—Human SMCs were purchased from Clonetics and were maintained in M199 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) at 37 °C in a humidified incubator in a 95% air, 5% CO2 atmosphere. SMCs from the fourth to the seventh passages were used for all experiments.Smooth Muscle Cell Proliferation Assay—SMCs were seeded in 24-well plates (20,000 cells/well) in triplicate and were allowed to adhere for 24 h. At this time, SMCs were given fresh medium and were incubated with the different r-apo(a) variants (50 nm) for 96 h. SMC proliferation was determined by counting the cells with a hemacytometer following release with 0.05% trypsin, 0.01% EDTA. For each condition, cell counts were determined in triplicate wells, and the value for each well was the mean of the cell count in eight different fields of the hemacytometer. In some experiments, FCS was substituted with FCS that had been depleted of plasminogen by passage of the serum over a lysine-Sepharose column.Smooth Muscle Cell Migration Assay—Bulk human SMC migration was measured using a 48-well microchemotaxis chamber (27Pickering J.G.

The chamber and membrane were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. The lower well of the chamber was filled with M199 medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin. SMCs (grown for 96 h in M199 medium containing 10% FCS in the presence or absence of the different r-apo(a) variants at a concentration of 50 nm) were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, trypsinized, and seeded in the upper wells of the chamber (20,000 cells/well) in M199 medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Migration was allowed to proceed for 6 h at 37 °C in a humidified incubator in a 95% air, 5% CO2 atmosphere. The cells remaining on the upper surface of the membrane were mechanically removed using a wiper blade. The migrating cells on the lower surface were fixed in methanol for 5 min, stained with hematoxylin for 5 min, and washed in water. The membrane was mounted with aqueous mounting medium (50% glycerol, 100 mg/ml diazobicyclo[2.2.2]octane, 0.01% sodium azide, 0.2 m Na2HPO4, pH 9.05) and sealed. The number of cells that had migrated to the lower surface of the membrane was determined by counting under high power (400× magnification) microscopy. All conditions were performed in triplicate with cell counts determined in each case for eight fields of view.Digital Time Lapse Video Microscopy—Migration speed of SMCs was determined by digital time lapse video microscopy (28Li S. Chow L.H. Pickering J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35384-35392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 29Rocnik E. Chan B.M.C. Pickering J.G. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 1889-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Human arterial SMCs were grown for 96 h in M199 medium containing 10% FCS either in the presence or absence of the different r-apo(a) variants at a concentration of 50 nm. Preincubated cells were seeded onto 35-mm culture dishes in bicarbonate-reduced medium containing 10% FCS (M199 medium containing Hanks' salts and 25 mm HEPES) to maintain physiological pH in room air. Ambient temperature was maintained at 37 °C using a temperature control cell (BC-100, 20/20 Technology, Inc.), and evaporation/condensation was prevented by applying a stream of humidified warm (37 °C) air across the culture lid. Migration was monitored with an inverted microscope (Axiovert, Zeiss) over an 8-h period using a CCD camera (XC-75CE, Sony), and images were digitally acquired. The location of cell centroids at hourly intervals was tracked off line (Northern Eclipse, Empix Imaging Inc.), and migration speed was determined as the sum of hourly distances divided by the total time.TGF-β Bioassay—Conditioned medium from SMCs was prepared by collecting the medium from SMCs grown in the absence or presence of the different r-apo(a) variants at a concentration of 50 nm for 96 h. To determine the total amount of TGF-β (latent plus active), the latent TGF-β was activated by acidification of the medium (to pH 1.5 with the addition of 1 m HCl) for 1 h followed by neutralization with 1 m NaOH. The quantity of active TGF-β in the conditioned medium was determined by a mink lung epithelial cell growth inhibition assay as described previously (30Ford C.M. Li S. Pickering J.G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 1843-1851Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Standard curves for TGF-β were established by logit-log transformations of [3H]thymidine incorporation data as a function of the TGF-β dose (2–125 pg/ml). This produced a linear plot that was used to calculate the concentration of TGF-β in experimental samples by interpolation from the amount of [3H]thymidine incorporated by the treated cells. The TGF-β concentration was normalized to total cellular protein.Statistical Methods—Differences between experimental values obtained in the presence or absence of the different r-apo(a) variants were evaluated for statistical significance using a one-way analysis of variance and the Dunnett posthoc test.RESULTSRecombinant Apo(a) Stimulates SMC Proliferation—Previous studies have demonstrated that Lp(a), through its apo(a) component, stimulates human vascular SMC proliferation (16Grainger D.J. Kirschenlohr H.L. Metcalfe J.C. Weissberg P.L. Wade D.P. Lawn R.M. Science. 1993; 260: 1655-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). To identify the domain or domains in apo(a) that mediate these effects, we utilized a battery of r-apo(a) variants representing systematic deletions of key domains in the molecule (Fig. 1A). All variants were expressed in human embryonic kidney cells and were purified to homogeneity (Fig. 1B) from conditioned medium harvested from stably expressing cell lines. The 17K r-apo(a) contains all of the domains found in apo(a) and in fact represents a physiologically relevant isoform (23Koschinsky M.L. Tomlinson J.E. Zioncheck T.F. Schwartz K. Eaton D.L. Lawn R.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5044-5051Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The 17KΔAsp species contains an amino acid substitution that abolishes the strong lysine-binding site in KIV10.Different concentrations of 17K r-apo(a) were incubated with human arterial SMCs for 96 h at which time the cells were counted using a hemacytometer. The 17K r-apo(a) resulted in a ∼60% increase in SMC proliferation; this value was achieved at a r-apo(a) concentration of 50 nm, and no further increase was observed at r-apo(a) concentrations up to 500 nm (Fig. 2A). For all subsequent experiments, a r-apo(a) concentration of 50 nm was used.Fig. 2The 17K r-apo(a) stimulates SMC proliferation. A, human aortic SMCs were incubated for 96 h with different concentrations of 17K r-apo(a) prior to trypsinization and counting with a hemacytometer. The data shown are the means and S.D. of triplicate wells for each concentration of r-apo(a) and are representative of at least two independent experiments. B, human aortic SMCs were incubated for different times in the absence or presence of 50 nm 17K r-apo(a) prior to trypsinization and counting with a hemacytometer. The data shown are the means and S.D. of triplicate wells at each time point and are representative of at least two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next examined the time course of the effect of 17K rapo(a) on SMC proliferation (Fig. 2B). The stimulatory effect of 17K r-apo(a) was observed after 24 h of incubation, and this effect was maintained until 96 h of incubation, the longest time point tested. We used a 96-h incubation of r-apo(a) with the SMCs for all subsequent experiments.We examined the ability of each of our r-apo(a) variants to stimulate SMC proliferation (Fig. 3). In addition to the 17K r-apo(a), seven of the variants significantly stimulated proliferation (between ∼20 and 60%). Interestingly the three rapo(a) variants that had no effect on SMC proliferation, namely KIV1–4, KIV5–8, and KIV10–P, were the only three that lacked KIV9. Moreover, deletion of every other domain in r-apo(a) besides KIV9 results in species that retain the ability to stimulate SMC proliferation.Fig. 3Apo(a) kringle IV type 9 is required for the stimulation of SMC proliferation. Human aortic SMCs were incubated for 96 h in the presence of a 50 nm concentration of the indicated r-apo(a) variants or in the absence of r-apo(a). The cells were then trypsinized and counted using a hemacytometer. The data shown are the means and S.D. of determinations from triplicate wells and are representative of at least three independent experiments. The asterisks represent cell numbers that are significantly different (p < 0.05) from the cell number in the absence of r-apo(a).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Recombinant Apo(a) Stimulates SMC Migration—It has been shown that Lp(a), again through its apo(a) component, is capable of stimulating vascular SMC migration in an in vitro wound assay (15Kojima S. Harpel P.C. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1439-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). We utilized a Boyden chamber to determine the domains in r-apo(a) that mediate stimulation of SMC migration (Fig. 4). SMCs were grown for 96 h in the absence of apo(a) or in the presence of r-apo(a) variants at a concentration of 50 nm. The SMCs were then seeded in microchemotaxis chambers, and migration was allowed to proceed for 6 h prior to counting the number of cells that had migrated to the lower surface of the membrane. The 17K r-apo(a) resulted in an approximate doubling of the number of migrating SMCs in this assay (Fig. 4). Remarkably, we observed the identical pattern with respect to the r-apo(a) variants that stimulated SMC migration versus SMC proliferation: the three variants that lack KIV9 were the only ones that did not significantly stimulate SMC migration.Fig. 4Apo(a) stimulates SMC migration, and kringle IV type 9 is required for this effect. Human aortic SMCs were incubated for 96 h in the presence of a 50 nm concentration of the indicated r-apo(a) variants or in the absence of r-apo(a). The cells were then seeded in the upper chamber of a microchemotaxis chamber. Migration of the cells was allowed to proceed for 6 h at which time the cells that had migrated to the lower surface of the chamber membrane were counted under high power magnification. The cell number for each treatment was performed in triplicate with counts obtained for eight fields of view. The data shown are the means and S.D. and are representative of at least two independent experiments. The asterisks represent cell numbers that are significantly different (p < 0.05) from the cell number in the absence of r-apo(a).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To directly measure the effect of apo(a) on SMC migration speed, we used digital time lapse video microscopy to follow the movements of individual SMCs preincubated for 96 h with apo(a). “Spider” diagrams representing the movements of 10 cells/condition are shown in Fig 5A. They clearly demonstrate that 17K r-apo(a), KIV5–P, and KIV9–P increase the speed of SMC migration; average migration speeds calculated from the migration paths are presented graphically in Fig. 5B. Consistent with the requirement for KIV9 for apo(a) stimulation of SMC migration, KIV1–4 had no effect on SMC migration speed (Fig. 5B).Fig. 5Effect of r-apo(a) on SMC migration speed as assessed by digital time lapse video microscopy. A, human aortic SMCs were incubated for 96 h in the presence of a 50 nm concentration of the indicated r-apo(a) variants or in the absence of r-apo(a). The cells were then seeded in 35-mm plates for observation of their migration. Depicted for each condition are the hourly migration paths of 10 cells over a period of 8 h. Distances from the origin are in μm. B, the migration speeds of the cells (10 cells/condition) depicted in A were determined by dividing the sum of the distances traveled each hour by the total time elapsed and are displayed on the graph as the means and S.D.

This “preapoptotic chromatin condensation” (PACC) occurs before mitochondrial membrane permeabilization (MMP) and caspase activation become detectable and is not inhibited by Z-VAD-fmk or Bcl-2. PACC is followed by classical apoptosis, when cells are cultured overnight, even when STS is removed from the system. After overnight incubation, STS-pretreated cells manifest mitochondrial cytochrome c release, caspase activation, phosphatidylserine exposure, and apoptotic DNA fragmentation. Caspase or MMP inhibitors did not influence the advent of PACC yet did suppress the evolution of PACC toward apoptosis. Importantly, two unrelated MMP inhibitors (viral mitochondrial inhibitor of apoptosis (vMIA) from cytomegalovirus and mitochondrion-targeted Bcl-2) had a larger range of effects than the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk. Caspase inhibition simply prevented the transition from PACC to apoptosis yet did not reverse PACC and did not restore transcription. In contrast, Bcl-2 and vMIA allowed for the repair of the DNA lesions, correlating with the reestablishment of active transcription. PACC could also be induced by a gross perturbation of RNA synthesis or primary DNA damage. Again, inhibition of MMP (but not that of caspases) reversed PACC induced by these stimuli.

Chromatin condensation and chromatinolysis constitute the classical hallmarks of apoptosis, and both have been thought for long to be both pathognomonic and responsible for apoptotic death (1Kerr J.F.R. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12725) Google Scholar, 2Wyllie A.H. Nature. 1980; 284: 555-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (4138) Google Scholar). Today, it appears clear that full-blown nuclear condensation (pyknosis), formation of nuclear apoptotic bodies (karyorrhexis), and advanced DNA fragmentation (into oligonucleosomes leading to the “apoptotic DNA ladder”) actually are postmortem manifestations, occurring well after the point-of-no-return has been trespassed and irreversible mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and/or explosive caspase activation have sealed the fate of the cell (3Kroemer G.

Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3991) Google Scholar), which alone or together constitute the point-of-no-return of the lethal signal transduction cascade. Two major pathways can lead to apoptosis (13Igney F.H. Krammer P.H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (1615) Google Scholar). The intrinsic (or stress) pathway is triggered by a wide range of inducers including STS, inhibitors of mRNA synthesis (such as actinomycin D), or DNA damage. This pathway critically relies on MMP, which causes bioenergetic failure and the release of potentially cytotoxic proteins from the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Such apoptogenic factors include caspase activators (prototype: cytochrome c, which activates the apoptosome caspase activation complex, once in the cytosol) and caspase-independent death effectors (prototype: apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), which translocates to the nucleus) (14Penninger J.M. Kroemer G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 97-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). MMP is regulated, at least in part, by proteins of the Bcl-2 family (15Zamzami N. Kroemer G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). The extrinsic (or death receptor) pathway involves activation of plasma membrane receptor of the death receptor superfamily (e.g. CD95/Apo-1/Fas), leading to the receptor-proximal recruitment of a caspase activation complex (13Igney F.H. Krammer P.H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (1615) Google Scholar). The resulting activation of caspase-8 either is sufficient to trigger the proteolytic activation of other caspases or requires the proteolytic activation of proapoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family (in particular, Bid), which causes MMP and thus triggers the “mitochondrial amplification loop.”The characterization of factors responsible for chromatin condensation and chromatinolysis has yielded important insights into the pathophysiology of cellular demise.

Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 1219-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) have been reported to cause chromatin condensation and nuclear DNA fragmentation, to a variable degree. Thus, caspase-dependent DNase, DNase II, and endonuclease G cause oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation (16Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyoma H. Okawa K. Iwamtsu A. Nagata S.

Similarly, caspase-dependent chromatin condensation is far more pronounced than that induced by AIF, which is more peripheral (19Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Snow B.E. Brothers G.M.

Accordingly, some authors have distinguished “true apoptosis” (caspase-dependent), with full-blown chromatin condensation, from “apoptosis-like cell death” (caspase-independent) with partial chromatin condensation (25Leist M. Jaattela M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (1376) Google Scholar, 26Jaattela M. Tschopp J. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 416-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Similarly, there have been attempts to distinguish an early “stage I” chromatin condensation (AIF-dependent) from a later “stage II” (caspase-dependent) (27Daugas E. Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Ferri K. Irinopoulos T. Larochette N. Prevost M.C. Leber B. Andrews D. Penninger J. Kroemer G. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 729-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar).When carefully examining the morphology of HeLa cells treated with a short pulse (2-4 h) of STS, we found a rather partial “preapoptotic chromatin condensation” (PACC), which occurred before the mitochondrial checkpoint had been activated and before caspase activation through the intrinsic pathway was detectable. Biochemical and functional analysis revealed that STS-induced PACC involved double strand breaks, which occurred before apoptosis and independently from apoptosis because it was not affected by a range of MMP and caspase inhibitors. Importantly, however, MMP inhibitors (but not caspase inhibitors) allowed cells with PACC to repair their DNA and to return to a normal nuclear morphology. These findings reveal unexpected effects of STS on genome integrity. Moreover, MMP inhibition appears to be more effective in triggering DNA repair than caspase inhibition.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Lines and Culture Conditions—HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 10 mm Hepes, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C under 5% CO2.

Mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum-specific targeting of Bcl-2 was achieved by exchanging the C-terminal insertion sequence of Bcl-2 with equivalent sequences of the listerial protein ActA and rat cytochrome b5, respectively (30Zhu W.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1939-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The expression of Bcl-2 was determined by immunoblot using an anti-Bcl-2 antibody (Bcl2(100) mouse monoclonal antibody, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase expression was monitored as a loading control.Immunofluorescence and Flow Cytometry—HeLa and HCT116 cells were cultured on coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine and nuclei or mitochondria were stained by 2 μm Hoechst 33342 (Sigma) or 3,9-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide (2 μm; Molecular Probes), respectively, before fluorescence microscopic assessment (32Ferri K.F. Jacotot E. Blanco J. Esté J.A. Zamzami A. Susin S.A. Brothers G. Reed J.C. Penninger J.M. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1081-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). TUNEL staining was performed with a detection kit from Roche Applied Science. Specific antibodies for activated Bak (Bak Ab-1, Oncogene Research Products), cytochrome c (Pharmingen), activated caspase-3 (Casp-3 a, Cell Signaling Technology), phosphorylated-histone H2AX (Ser-139, Upstate Cell Signaling), phosphorylated p53 (Ser-15), and phospho-Chk2 (Thr-68, Cell Signaling Technology) were used on paraformaldehyde-fixed (4% w/v) cells. All were detected by a goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit IgG-conjugated Alexa® Fluor from Molecular Probes (33Boya P. Andreau K. Poncet D. Zamzami N. Perfettini J-L. Metivier D. Ojcius D.M. Jaattela M. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 1323-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Cytofluorometric analyses were performed by using 40 nm 3,3-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (DiOC6(3)) for Δψm quantification (34Zamzami N. Metivier D. Kroemer G.

Hirsch T. Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Marchetti P. Macho A. Kroemer G. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 512-521PubMed Google Scholar). Quantification of DNA content was performed on ethanol-fixed cells, which were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (2.5 μg/ml; Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cellular shrinkage determination was performed by analysis of forward side scatter parameter on FACS Vantage (BD Biosciences).Electron Microscopy—Cells were fixed for 1 h at 4 °C in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), washed, and fixed again in 2% osmium tetroxide before embedding in Epon. Electron microscopy was performed with a transmission electron microscope (model EM902; Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.), at 80 kV, on ultrathin sections (80 nm) stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate.DNA Fragmentation—For pulse field gel electrophoresis, DNA was prepared from agarose plugs (2 × 106 cells) followed by electrophoresis in a Bio-Rad CHEF-DRII (1% agarose, Tris-borate-EDTA, 200 V, 24 h, pulse wave 60 s, 120°angle). Double-stranded DNA breaks were assessed by comet assays performed using a kit from Trevigen. Briefly, cells were immobilized in a bed of low melting point agarose, following a gentle cell lysis; cleaved DNA fragments migrated out of the cell under electrophoresis.Transcription Assay—Transcription was monitored by an overnight transient transfection of control plasmids (pTA-LUC and pTAL-LUC) or plasmids containing luciferase reporter gene coupled to CMV promoter (pCMV-LUC) or specific cis-DNA sequence (cAMP-response element-binding protein, NFκB, AP1, STAT, and p53, Mercury Pathway Profiling Systems, Clontech). Protein extracts in equivalent protein concentration samples were mixed with 100 μl of substrates (luciferase reporter assay kit, Clontech). Luciferase activity was determined at 25 °C after 10 s with a luminometer (Lumat LB9507, Berthold Technologies GmbH & Co., Bad Wildbad, Germany) and expressed as fold induction of transcription as the ratio of luciferase activity units as compared with plasmid control transfections.ATM siRNA—Subconfluent Hela cells were transfected with Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) complexed with ATM siRNA (sense 5′-CAUACUACUCAAAGACAUU-dTdT-3′, antisense 5′-AAUGUCUUUGAGUAGUAUGdTdT-3′) (36Zhou N.

Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase expression was monitored as a loading control.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONPACC in STS-treated Cells—HeLa cells exposed to a short pulse (3 h) of the general apoptosis inducer STS manifested ruffling of nuclear membranes, accompanied by a partial peripheral chromatin condensation. This phenomenon, which we termed PACC, was well detectable by electron microscopy (Fig. 1A) as well as by staining with the chromatin-specific dye Hoechst 33342 (Fig. 1B). It was detectable well before major shrinkage was detectable, before PS residues were exposed on the plasma membrane surface (detectable with annexin V-FITC) and before cells lost their viability (and thus became permeable to the vital dye propidium iodide). However, if cells that had been pulse-treated with STS (3 h) were washed and cultured overnight (18 h), they manifested hallmarks of apoptosis such as massive chromatin condensation with karyorrhexis (Fig. 1, A-C) and PS exposure (Fig. 1C). Accordingly, STS pulse-treated cells were TUNEL-negative yet evolved to TUNEL positivity when they underwent further overnight culture (Fig. 1D). Moreover, STS-pulsed cells manifesting PACC had a normal Δψm (as quantified with DiOC6(3)), a low oxidative potential (as quantified with the superanion oxide-reactive hydroethidine), failed to manifest the apoptotic activation of Bak (as detected with an antibody that recognizes its exposed N terminus), and showed no sign of mitochondrial cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation (as determined with an antibody recognizing the neomycin epitope formed by its proteolytic maturation) (Fig. 2). Similarly, AIF was still localized in mitochondria at this stage (38Arnoult D. Parone P. Martinou J-C. Antonsson B. Estaquier J. Ameisen J.C. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 59: 923-929Crossref Scopus (278) Google Scholar), and RNA interference of AIF did not prevent PACC (not shown). PACC was not prevented by the addition of the broad spectrum caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk (Figs. 1, A-D, and 2, A and B). As an internal control of its efficiency, however, Z-VAD-fmk did prevent the advancement to nuclear apoptosis (Fig. 1, A and D), caspase-3 activation, and oxidative reactions (Fig. 2, A and B). PACC was not inhibited by structurally related, more specific caspase inhibitors containing the peptide sequences VDVAD (specific for caspase-2), DEVD (specific for caspase-3), or LEHD (specific for caspase-9) (not shown). Altogether these data indicate that STS can trigger a morphological state of PACC, which becomes apparent before mitochondrial apoptosis and caspase activation.Fig. 2PACC occurs upstream of the MMP checkpoint. A, HeLa cells treated with STS for 3 h alone (3h, STS) or with Z-VAD-fmk (3h, STS +zVAD) or STS pulse-treated HeLa cells recultured for 18 h in the absence (3h, STS + 18h) or presence of Z-VAD-fmk (3h, STS + 18h, zVAD) were directly stained with DiOC6(3) and hydroethidine (HE) or fixed and permeabilized followed by staining with antibodies recognizing activated Bak (Bak a), cytochrome c (Cyt c), or the p17/p19 fragment of proteolytically activated caspase-3 (Casp-3a) and counterstained with Hoechst 33342.

Daugas E. Ravagnan L. Samejima K. Zamzami N. Loeffler M. Costantini P. Ferri K.F. Irinopoulou T. Prévost M.-C. Brothers G. Mak T.W. Penninger J. Earnshaw W.C. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). However, PACC was accompanied by DNA double strand breaks, as detectable with the sensitive comet assay (Fig. 3, C and D). DNA double strand breaks acutely detectable after the STS pulse were not prevented by Z-VAD-fmk, and the caspase inhibitor did not stimulate their repair upon reculture in STS-free medium (Fig. 3B). As compared with apoptotic nuclei, the transcriptional activity of PACC nuclei was only partially reduced, thus excluding that massive DNA damage had occurred (Fig. 4A). The partial inhibition of transcription by PACC was not specific, as reporter genes indicating the activation of a variety of different transcription factors (NFκB, AP1, cAMP-response element-binding protein, Stat, p53) were inhibited to a similar level (Fig. 4B). DNA double strand breaks can give rise to the formation of “foci” to which DNA repair enzymes, phosphorylated histone H2AX, and phosphorylated checkpoint kinase-2 are recruited (39Banath J.P. Olive P.L. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4347-4350PubMed Google Scholar, 40Burma S. Chen B.P. Murphy M. Kurimasa A. Chen D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42462-42467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1452) Google Scholar). Accordingly, PACC elicited by an STS pulse was accompanied by the formation of nuclear foci containing immunodetectable phosphorylated histone H2AX and phosphorylated checkpoint kinase-2. These foci developed in a caspase-independent fashion and disappeared when PACC advanced to nuclear apoptosis and the nuclear content was degraded (Fig. 5). However, they were maintained in the presence of Z-VAD-fmk. These data suggest that STS causes DNA damage before it induces apoptosis.Fig. 3Analysis of DNA degradation and double strand breaks. After the indicated regimes of STS/Z-VAD-fmk (zVAD) treatment (as described in the previous figure legends), nuclear DNA was subjected to pulse field gel electrophoresis (A) or, alternatively, to ethanol fixation and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining for the cytofluorometric determination of subdiploidy (X ± S.D., n = 3) (B). In addition, the cells were subjected to a comet assay (C), and the frequency of comet assay-positive cells (D) was determined by microscopic observation (X ± S.D., n = 3). p values were calculated to assess the effect of Z-VAD-fmk as compared with controls cultured in the absence of this inhibitor. *, p < 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 4Analysis of transcription.

https://openalex.org/W2004553600,"The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) is required for maintenance of the viral genome DNA during the latent phase of EBV replication but continues to be synthesized after the induction of viral productive replication. An EBV genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that EBNA1 constantly binds to oriP of the EBV genome during not only latent but also lytic infection. Although the total levels of EBNA1 proved constant throughout the latter, the levels of the oriP-bound form were increased as lytic infection proceeded. EBV productive DNA replication occurs at discrete sites in nuclei, called replication compartments, where viral replication proteins are clustered. Confocal laser microscopic analyses revealed that whereas EBNA1 was distributed broadly in nuclei as fine punctate dots during the latent phase of infection, the protein became redistributed to the viral replication compartments and localized as distinct spots within and/or nearby the compartments after the induction of lytic replication. Taking these findings into consideration, oriP regions of the EBV genome might be organized by EBNA1 into replication domains that may set up scaffolding for lytic replication and transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2160683879,"The bifunctional enzyme UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase is the key enzyme for the biosynthesis of sialic acids. As terminal components of glycoconjugates, sialic acids are associated with a variety of pathological processes such as inflammation and cancer. For the first time, this study reveals characteristics of the interaction of the epimerase site of the enzyme with its natural substrate, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) and derivatives thereof at atomic resolution. Saturation transfer difference NMR experiments were crucial in obtaining ligand binding epitopes and to rank ligands according to their binding affinities. Employing a fragment based approach, it was possible to assign the major component of substrate recognition to the UDP moiety. In particular, the binding epitopes of the uridine moieties of UMP, UDP, UDP-GalNAc, and UDP-GlcNAc are rather similar, suggesting that the binding mode of the UDP moiety is the same in all cases. In contrast, the hexopyranose units of UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GalNAc display small differences reflecting the inability of the enzyme to process UDP-GalNAc. Surprisingly, saturation transfer difference NMR titrations show that UDP has the largest binding affinity to the epimerase site and that at least one phosphate group is required for binding. Consequently, this study provides important new data for rational drug design."
https://openalex.org/W2089690031,"Previous examination of the accessibility of a panel of single-Cys mutants in transmembrane domain III (TMDIII) of the yeast mitochondrial citrate transport protein to hydrophilic, cysteine-specific methanethiosulfonate reagents, enabled identification of the water-accessible surface of this domain and suggested its potential participation in the formation of a portion of the substrate translocation pathway. To evaluate this idea, we conducted a detailed characterization of the functional properties of 20 TMDIII single-Cys substitution mutants. Kinetic studies indicate that the A118C, S123C, and K134C mutants displayed a 3- to 7-fold increase in Km. Moreover, the A118C mutation caused a doubling of the Vmax value, whereas the S123C, E131C, and K134C mutations caused Vmax to dramatically decrease, resulting in a reduction of the catalytic efficiencies of these three mutants by >97%. Examination of the ability of citrate to protect against the inhibition mediated by sodium (2-sulfonatoethyl)methanethiosulfonate (MTSES) indicated that citrate conferred significant protection of cysteines substituted at eight water-accessible locations (i.e. Gly-115, Leu-116, Gly-117, Leu-121, Ser-123, Val-127, Glu-131, and Thr-135), but not at other sites. Importantly, similar levels of protection were observed at both 4 °C and 20 °C. The temperature independence of the protection indicates that substrate binding and/or occupancy of the transport pathway sterically blocks the access of MTSES to these sites, thereby providing direct protection, without involvement of a major protein conformational change.

The mitochondrial citrate transport protein (CTP) 1The abbreviations used are: CTP, citrate transport protein; BTC, 1,2,3-benzenetricarboxylate; MTS, methanethiosulfonate; MTSES, sodium (2-sulfonatoethyl)methanethiosulfonate; TMD, transmembrane domain. 1The abbreviations used are: CTP, citrate transport protein; BTC, 1,2,3-benzenetricarboxylate; MTS, methanethiosulfonate; MTSES, sodium (2-sulfonatoethyl)methanethiosulfonate; TMD, transmembrane domain. is located within the inner mitochondrial membrane and in higher eukaryotes catalyzes an electroneutral, obligatory exchange of the dibasic form of a tricarboxylic acid (e.g. citrate, isocitrate, and cis-aconitate) for either another tricarboxylate/H+, a dicarboxylate, or phosphoenolpyruvate (1Palmieri F. Stipani I. Quagliariello E. Klingenberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 26: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The CTP occupies an essential position in intermediary metabolism, because, following efflux from the mitochondria, cytoplasmic citrate provides the carbon source fueling both the sterol and fatty acid biosynthetic pathways and supplies NAD+ (via the sequential action of citrate lyase and malate dehydrogenase) required for glycolysis (2Watson J.A.

Thus it has been purified in reconstitutively active form (6Kaplan R.S. Mayor J.A. Johnston N. Oliveira D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13379-13385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Bisaccia F. De Palma A. Palmieri F. Biochim. Biophys.

Commun. 1995; 207: 783-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Current efforts have focused on the yeast mitochondrial CTP, because the yeast homologue retains a high degree of functionality following overexpression and purification (10Kaplan R.S. Mayor J.A. Gremse D.A. Wood D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4108-4114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), thereby rendering it ideal for a comprehensive structure/function analysis. As part of this analysis, we have constructed a functional Cys-less CTP (11Xu Y. Kakhniashvili D.A. Gremse D.A. Wood D.O. Mayor J.A. Walters D.E. Kaplan R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7117-7124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and have demonstrated that both the wild-type and the Cys-less CTP exist as a dimer in solution (12Kotaria R. Mayor J.A. Walters D.E. Kaplan R.S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 543-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Both hydropathy analysis and, more recently, a detailed CTP homology model that we developed (13Walters D.E. Kaplan R.S. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 907-911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) based on the crystallographic structure of the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier (14Pebay-Peyroula E. Dahout-Gonzalez C. Kahn R. Trezeguet V. G Lauquin J.-M Brandolin G. Nature. 2003; 426: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar) indicate that the CTP contains six TMDs per monomer. With this background in mind, we recently developed a panel of CTP variants in which native residues within TMDIII were replaced, one at a time, with Cys (15Ma C. Kotaria R. Mayor J.A. Eriks L.R. Dean A.M. Walters D.E. Kaplan R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1533-1540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Previously, this approach enabled identification of the water-accessible versus inaccessible surfaces of TMDIII by measuring the rate constants for the inhibition of function of a given CTP variant by the hydrophilic methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents. From these studies, we inferred that the water-accessible surface of TMDIII may comprise a portion of the substrate translocation pathway through the CTP, whereas the water-inaccessible surface likely faces the lipid bilayer. In the present study, we report results from experiments designed to test the hypothesis that the water-accessible surface of TMDIII does in fact comprise a portion of the substrate translocation pathway through the CTP. As part of our strategy, we conducted a detailed kinetic characterization of 20 single-Cys mutants within TMDIII. We then examined the ability of varying concentrations of substrate (citrate) to protect against MTSES-mediated inhibition of these mutants and identified eight sites at which protection occurs. To ascertain whether the protection occurs via a direct steric blockage versus by a substrate-induced change in the CTP conformation, we examined the temperature dependences of the observed protection. Finally, superimposition of our functional data onto a detailed CTP homology model (13Walters D.E. Kaplan R.S. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 907-911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), as well as a newly developed model of the CTP dimer interface, enabled a clear-cut definition of a portion of the substrate transport pathway through the CTP and provided potential molecular explanations for several unexpected findings. Incorporation of Cys-less and Single-Cys CTPs into Phospholipid Vesicles and Determination of Their Kinetic Properties—Overexpressed, partially purified Cys-less and single-Cys CTP variants were reconstituted into preformed liposomes via the freeze-thaw-sonication technique as previously described (6Kaplan R.S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 4108-4114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Immediately prior to the transport assay, a sample was thawed, and sonicated on ice, and extraliposomal citrate removed via chromatography on a Dowex column in a Pasteur pipette. Transport incubations were conducted at room temperature (20 °C), unless indicated otherwise, as follows. Proteoliposomes (45 μl) were preincubated with 3.5 μl of either buffer (6Kaplan R.S. Mayor J.A. Johnston N. Oliveira D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13379-13385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (experimental sample) or 200 mm BTC (control sample) for 10 min and were then further incubated with 3.5 μl of deionized/distilled water for an additional 10 min, prior to the transport triggering addition of 21.5 μl of varying concentrations of [1,5-14C]citrate (Amersham Biosciences). External citrate concentrations bracketing the Km were employed and ranged from 0.083 to 8 mm, depending on the kinetic properties of a given CTP variant. Typically, 10 different concentrations were employed. Following a 20-s to 10-min transport incubation (depending on the intrinsic activity of a given CTP mutant) the experimental sample was quenched by the addition of 3.5 μl of 200 mm BTC. The control sample received an equal volume of buffer. Intraliposomal radiolabeled citrate was separated from the external radiolabel via chromatography on small Dowex columns in Pasteur pipettes. The eluted (i.e. intraliposomal) radiolabel was quantified via liquid scintillation counting. The BTC-sensitive transport rate was calculated by subtracting the control value from the experimental value at each substrate concentration. For these studies, care was taken to ensure that initial rates were being measured. The rate of uptake versus substrate concentration curves were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation: v = Vmax × S/(Km + S) using a non-linear least squares curve fit. Determining the Extent of Substrate Protection against MTSES-mediated Inhibition of Citrate Transport—Substrate protection against MTSES-mediated inhibition of citrate transport was assessed as follows. Proteoliposomes (125 μl) were incubated with water (10 μl) versus water (7 μl) plus MTSES (3 μl) versus varying concentrations of unlabeled citrate (7 μl) plus MTSES (3 μl) for a period of time (i.e. 50 s to 4 h) at room temperature (i.e. 20 °C). Based on an initial series of experiments with each CTP variant, the concentration of MTSES and the length of the incubation interval that yielded ∼50–70% MTSES-mediated inhibition, in the absence of unlabeled external citrate, were chosen. The only exception was the I113C mutant with which only limited inhibition could be obtained under the conditions utilized for this assay. When present, citrate was added prior to MTSES. Following incubation with MTSES with or without citrate, the reaction mixes were diluted via the addition of 6–12 ml of ice-cold buffer. Unreacted MTSES and citrate were removed by ultracentrifugation at ∼412,000 × g for 25 min at 6 °C. The proteoliposomal pellets were washed with 6 ml of ice-cold buffer and subsequently resuspended gently in 115 μl of buffer. Transport incubations were conducted in duplicate with each resuspended pellet as follows. Briefly, 45 μl of proteoliposomes were incubated with buffer (3.5 μl) (6Kaplan R.S. Mayor J.A. Johnston N. Oliveira D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13379-13385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for 30 s. Transport was then triggered via the addition of 21.5 μl of [1,5-14C]citrate (Amersham Biosciences). The length of the transport interval time was determined based on the intrinsic activity of a given mutant. The transport reactions were quenched via the addition of 3.5 μl of 200 mm BTC (final concentration in reaction mix = 9 mm). Experimental and control transport reactions were carried out using the proteoliposomes from the previous incubation with water. The experimental transport reaction was performed exactly as described above. For the control transport reaction, the order of addition of buffer and BTC was reversed. Thus the control received 3.5 μl of BTC at the beginning of the preincubation, and buffer instead of BTC at the end of reaction. Following all transport incubations, intraliposomal radiolabeled citrate was separated by chromatography on small Dowex columns and quantified as described above. The proportion of activity remaining after preincubation with MTSES with or without varying concentrations of unlabeled citrate was determined by subtracting the control rate from the rate observed either in the presence of MTSES alone or in the presence of unlabeled citrate plus MTSES and calculating the ratio of this difference to the uninhibited BTC-sensitive transport rate (i.e. experimental rate minus the control rate). The percent remaining activity (i.e. the percentage of control activity) was obtained by multiplying the proportion remaining activity by 100. For the cases where unlabeled citrate protected against MTSES-mediated inhibition of CTP function, in a plot of the percentage of control activity versus citrate concentration, we fitted the data to a modified one-site binding equation: Y = A + [(B × S)/(EC50 + S)], where S is the citrate concentration, Y is the percentage of control activity remaining in the presence of MTSES plus a given citrate concentration S, A is the percent activity remaining when only MTSES was present, and B is the maximal percent control activity obtained via substrate protection. EC50 is the effective concentration of citrate that yields one half-maximal protection against MTSES-mediated transport inhibition. Molecular Modeling of the CTP—Molecular modeling was carried out using version 2004.03 of Molecular Operating Environment, obtained from Chemical Computing Group, Montreal. The homology-modeled CTP structure was constructed as described previously (13Walters D.E. Kaplan R.S. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 907-911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Energetically reasonable side-chain conformers were identified using the Rotamer Explorer function in Molecular Operating Environment. Kinetic Characterization of TMDIII Single-Cys CTP Mutants—The present investigations focused initially on characterization of the effect of single-Cys substitutions on the kinetic properties of the CTP. We examined those residues within TMDIII that, based on our previous MTS rate constant experiments (15Ma C. Kotaria R. Mayor J.A. Eriks L.R. Dean A.M. Walters D.E. Kaplan R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1533-1540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), comprise the water-accessible and -inaccessible surfaces of this transmembrane α-helix. Each single-Cys substitution mutant was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and solubilized from isolated inclusion bodies with the anionic detergent Sarkosyl. The partially purified single-Cys mutants were then incorporated into liposomes, and their kinetic properties were assessed. Table I depicts the results of these studies in which we determined the apparent affinity (Km), the maximum velocity (Vmax), and the catalytic efficiency (Vmax/Km) for each CTP variant. We observed that, of the 20 mutants studied, 15 displayed decreases in their Km values, 11 of which reached statistical significance. Moreover, 18 of the mutants displayed decreased Vmax values, 17 of which were statistically significant. Because the reduction in the Vmax values were more pronounced than the alteration in the Km values, most mutants displayed moderately reduced catalytic efficiencies ranging from 32 to 95% of the control value. Notably, three mutants, A118C, S123C, and K134C, displayed statistically significant increases in their Km values, ranging from a 3- to 7-fold elevation over the Cys-less control value. Interestingly, of these three mutants, only the A118C variant also displayed a significant increase in its Vmax value (i.e. 3180 versus 1402 nmol/min/mg; A118C versus Cys-less control, respectively). In contrast, the S123C and K134C variants displayed severely compromised Vmax values that were only 7 and 4% of the control value. Similarly, the E131C variant displayed a Vmax that was reduced to <1% of the control value, although in this case a moderate reduction in the Km value was observed. Of the 20 CTP mutants studied, the S123C, E131C, and K134C replacements displayed severely compromised catalytic efficiencies that were reduced by 97–99% relative to the control value. Finally, as noted previously (15Ma C. Kotaria R. Mayor J.A. Eriks L.R. Dean A.M. Walters D.E. Kaplan R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1533-1540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), with each of the 20 single-Cys CTP variants, a similar proportion of total protein was recovered in the liposomal pellet (i.e. 69% ± 6%; mean ± S.D.). Thus alterations in Vmax values reflect the intrinsic molecular properties of a given mutant and do not arise as a consequence of the preferential incorporation of one mutant versus another into the vesicles.Table IKinetic characterization of single-Cys substitution mutants in TMD III of the CTP Transport reactions and calculation of Km and Vmax were conducted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data represent means ± S.E. from at least duplicate Vi versus [S] profiles employing 10 different substrate concentrations that bracketed the Km value.KmVmaxVmax/Kmmmnmol/min/mgnmol/min/mg/mmCys-less0.471 ± 0.0521402 ± 692977 (100%)Ile-1130.494 ± 0.003867 ± 99aValues are p < 0.01 from a two-tailed Student's t test between the Cys-less CTP and individual single-Cys mutants1755 (59.0%)Ala-1140.296 ± 0.002552 ± 5aValues are p < 0.01 from a two-tailed Student's t test between the Cys-less CTP and individual single-Cys mutants1865 (62.6%)Gly-1150.388 ± 0.005149 ± 5aValues are p < 0.01 from a two-tailed Student's t test between the Cys-less CTP and individual single-Cys mutants384 (12.9%)Leu-1160.228 ± 0.008bValues are p < 0.075487 ± 23aValues are p < 0.01 from a two-tailed Student's t test between the Cys-less CTP and individual single-Cys mutants2136 (71.7%)Gly-1170.355 ± 0.0271448 ± 44079 (137.0%)Ala-1183.337 ± 0.031aValues are p < 0.01 from a two-tailed Student's t test between the Cys-less CTP and individual single-Cys mutants3180 ± 103aValues are p < 0.01 from a two-tailed Student's t test between the Cys-less CTP and individual single-Cys mutants953 (32.0%)Leu-1200.397 ± 0.026567 ± 34aValues are p < 0.01 from a two-tailed Student's t test between the Cys-less CTP and individual single-Cys mutants1428 (48.0%)Leu-1210.300 ± 0.018640 ± 36aValues are p < 0.01 from a two-tailed Student's t test between the Cys-less CTP and individual single-Cys mutants2133 (71.7%)Ser-1232.502 ± 0.928aValues are p < 0.01 from a two-tailed Student's t test between the Cys-less CTP and individual single-Cys mutants104 ± 15aValues are p < 0.01 from a two-tailed Student's t test between the Cys-less CTP and individual single-Cys mutants42 (1.4%)Ala-1250.367 ± 0.0081257 ± 313425 (115.1%)Ala-1260.227 ± 0.019bValues are p < 0.075468 ± 55aValues are p < 0.01 from a two-tailed Student's t test between the Cys-less CTP and individual single-Cys mutants2062 (69.3%)Val-1270.136 ± 0.006cValues are p < 0.05229 ± 29aValues are p < 0.01 from a two-tailed Student's t test between the Cys-less CTP and individual single-Cys mutants1684 (56.6%)Pro-1290.236 ± 0.010cValues are p < 0.05669 ± 17aValues are p < 0.01 from a two-tailed Student's t test between the Cys-less CTP and individual single-Cys mutants2835 (95.2%)Phe-1300.321 ± 0.041731 ± 40aValues are p < 0.01 from a two-tailed Student's t test between the Cys-less CTP and individual single-Cys mutants2277 (76.5%)Glu-1310.170 ± 0.014cValues are p < 0.0513 ± 1aValues are p < 0.01 from a two-tailed Student's t test between the Cys-less CTP and individual single-Cys mutants76 (2.6%)Ala-1320.136 ± 0.041cValues are p < 0.05396 ± 32aValues are p < 0.01 from a two-tailed Student's t test between the Cys-less CTP and individual single-Cys mutants2912 (97.8%)Ile-1330.108 ± 0.014cValues are p < 0.05189 ± 7aValues are p < 0.01 from a two-tailed Student's t test between the Cys-less CTP and individual single-Cys mutants1750 (58.8%)Lys-1341.339 ± 0.168aValues are p < 0.01 from a two-tailed Student's t test between the Cys-less CTP and individual single-Cys mutants56 ± 12aValues are p < 0.01 from a two-tailed Student's t test between the Cys-less CTP and individual single-Cys mutants42 (1.4%)Thr-1350.118 ± 0.005cValues are p < 0.05267 ± 32aValues are p < 0.01 from a two-tailed Student's t test between the Cys-less CTP and individual single-Cys mutants2263 (76.0%)Ala-1360.473 ± 0.0611197 ± 552531 (85.0%)a Values are p < 0.01 from a two-tailed Student's t test between the Cys-less CTP and individual single-Cys mutantsb Values are p < 0.075c Values are p < 0.05 Open table in a new tab Substrate Protection Against Inhibition by MTSES—In earlier studies (15Ma C.

Chem. 2004; 279: 1533-1540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that MTSES effectively inhibits each of the mutants depicted in Table I with inhibition rate constants that vary by over five orders of magnitude. These results provided a delineation of the water-accessible and -inaccessible surfaces of TMDIII (15Ma C. Kotaria R. Mayor J.A. Eriks L.R. Dean A.M. Walters D.E. Kaplan R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1533-1540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To test the supposition that the water-accessible surface of TMDIII comprises a portion of the substrate translocation pathway through the CTP, whereas the less accessible surfaces (which presumably face either the lipid bilayer or other portions of the protein) do not, we examined the ability of citrate to protect against the MTSES-mediated inhibition of transport. For these studies, when possible, we chose MTSES concentrations yielding 50–70% inhibition of citrate transport and examined the ability of varying concentrations of citrate to protect against this inhibition. As depicted in Fig. 1, substantial protection was observed with Cys substitutions at residues Gly-115, Leu-116, Gly-117, Leu-121, Ser-123, Val-127, Glu-131, and Thr-135. The EC50 values ranged from 1.18 to 53.68 mm. Significantly, most of the substrate-protectable residues (with the possible exception of the S123C variant) display EC50 values that are considerably greater than the Km values, suggesting that while these residues comprise a portion of the transport pathway, they are unlikely to be the primary determinants in formation of the substrate binding site. In contrast to the above findings, no measurable protection was observed with Cys substitutions for residues Ile-113, Ala-114, Ala-118, Leu-120, Ala-125, Ala-126, Pro-129, Phe-130, Ala-132, Ile-133, Lys-134, and Ala-136. It is interesting to note that the non-protected residues fall into two groups. In one group, represented by substitutions at Ile-113, Ala-114, Pro-129, Ile-133, and Ala-136, the residual activity versus protecting citrate concentration profile is essentially flat as would typically be expected for a non-protected residue. However, in the second group, consisting of replacements at residues Ala-118, Leu-120, Ala-125, Ala-126, Phe-130, Ala-132, and Lys-134, there is a continuing decline in CTP activity following co-incubation with MTSES and increasing concentrations of citrate. Thus, we conclude that higher concentrations of citrate place the CTP into one or more conformations in which the single-Cys mutation has enhanced accessibility and consequent reactivity to MTSES, thereby resulting in an enhanced inhibition by MTSES. Importantly, control studies in which similar incubations were conducted with the Cys-less CTP (and therefore any observed effects can not be ascribed to the interaction of MTSES with a cysteine) indicate that little inhibition was observed (data not shown). Thus, the increasing MTSES-mediated inhibition observed at elevated citrate concentrations with the second group of non-protected single-Cys mutants is not due to a nonspecific effect of the reagent upon either the liposomal bilayer or the CTP, but rather originates from an enhanced reaction of the reagent with the single-Cys substitution present within the CTP. Fig. 2 depicts the substrate protection data superimposed onto the homology-modeled CTP TMDIII. The substrate-protectable residues (denoted in red) mainly reside on one face of the α-helix (Fig. 2A), whereas the opposite face contains the residues that are not protected by substrate (denoted in blue in Fig. 2B). These findings are consistent with our MTS accessibility data and provide strong support for the postulate that the water-accessible, substrate-protectable residues comprise a portion of the substrate translocation pathway. It should be emphasized, however, that the data obtained with two CTP variants, namely L120C and L121C, did not follow the expected pattern. Thus, citrate did not protect against the MTSES-mediated inhibition of the L120C mutant, despite the fact that it appears to reside within the transport pathway (panel A). In contrast, citrate did protect against inhibition of the L121C variant, despite the fact that this residue does not appear to project into the CTP transport pathway (panel B). The origins of these unexpected findings will be explored in detail under “Discussion.” The Effect of Temperature on the Ability of Citrate to Protect against Inactivation by MTSES—As has been proposed with transporters from other superfamilies (16Seal R.P.

In the first scenario, occupancy of either the translocation pathway and/or the substrate binding site by citrate might provide a direct steric blockage of the approach of MTSES to the site of modification. In the second scenario, the observed substrate protection would occur as a consequence of a substrate-induced conformational change within the CTP that results in a reduction in the accessibility of a given Cys to MTSES. Thus, the latter scenario invokes the occurrence of one or more prominent conformational changes, which one therefore would expect to be temperature-dependent. In contrast, the first scenario does not require large repositioning of protein domains and therefore is thought to be largely temperature-independent. Notably, the occurrence of one or more major temperature-dependent conformational changes that are associated with one or more steps in the citrate transport mechanism is strongly supported by the data depicted in Fig. 3. Thus, the Vmax for citrate transport by the Cys-less CTP decreased by 92% when transport was conducted at 30 °C versus 4 °C (i.e. 2047 nmol/min/mg of protein (30 °C), 1424 nmol/min/mg of protein (20 °C), and 161 nmol/min/mg of protein (4 °C)).

We have identified an intronic region (designated 32kb-150), which is located 32 kb downstream of the transcription start sites in the human NMHC-A gene, as a transcriptional regulatory region. 32kb-150 contains an interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE). By using HeLa and NIH3T3 cells, in which NMHC-A is constitutively expressed, interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-2 was found to be the only major protein, among the IRF family proteins, that bound to the ISRE in 32kb-150 both in vitro and in intact cells.

However, regulatory mechanisms controlling NMHC-A gene expression during cell proliferation or differentiation have not been fully explored. Studies in this laboratory have been focused on characterization of the promoter and enhancers of the human NMHC-A gene (19Kawamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15101-15110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Beohar N. Kawamoto S. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8887-8897Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The promoter region of the NMHC-A gene shows a number of features typical of a housekeeping gene; there is no TATA box and the GC content is high, with multiple GC boxes. The proximal downstream region of the transcriptional initiation sites is involved in cell type-specific activation of this gene via both pre-translational (transcriptional) and translational mechanisms. An enhancer region composed of multiple clustered cis-elements, which is located 23 kb downstream of the promoter in intron 1, has been demonstrated to modulate transcription in cell type- and differentiation state-dependent manners. Sp1 and Sp3 specifically recognize one of the elements in this region (20Beohar N. Kawamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9168-9178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and TFEC, which is expressed abundantly in leukocytes, can act as a transcriptional activator via a second element (21Chung M.C. Kim H.K. Kawamoto S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8887-8897Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In this study, we describe another enhancer region, designated 32kb-150, which is also located in intron 1. The 32kb-150 enhancer region includes a previously unrecognized interferon (IFN)-stimulated response element (ISRE). The ISRE is recognized by a family of transcriptional factors, IFN regulatory factors (IRFs), some of which are induced by several types of IFNs (22Mamane Y. Heylbroeck C. Genin P. Algarte M. Servant M.J. LePage C. DeLuca C. Kwon H. Lin R. Hiscott J. Gene. 1999; 237: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 23Taniguchi T. Ogasawara K. Takaoka A. Tanaka N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 623-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar). This family of proteins has a conserved DNA-binding domain in the N-terminal region, which contains a characteristic repeat of five tryptophan residues. Two well studied members of the IRF family, IRF-1 and IRF-2, have antagonistic roles in IFN-related gene regulation; IRF-1 activates transcription of IFN-inducible genes and IRF-2 represses the activation by IRF-1 (24Harada H. Fujita T. Miyamoto M. Kimura Y. Maruyama M. Furia A. Miyata T. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1989; 58: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). On the other hand, IRF-1 and -2 are also involved in modulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis by regulating transcription of other sets of genes. Although IRF-2 was originally described as a transcriptional repressor, this protein can act as a transcriptional activator for some genes, including histone H4 and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 (25Vaughan P.S.

Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1265-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). IRF-2 can interact with other members of the IRF family and regulate cell growth- and differentiation-related genes in myeloid and lymphoid cells (29Tamura T. Nagamura-Inoue T. Shmeltzer Z. Kuwata T. Ozato K. Immunity. 2000; 13: 155-165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Some members of this family, such as IRF-4 and IRF-8, are expressed specifically in lymphoid and myeloid cells, whereas other members, including IRF-2, are expressed in most cells. Ubiquitous expression of IRF-2 and the diverse cellular functions involving IRF-2 suggest the existence of additional target genes that have not been described previously. Herein, we report that IRF-2 acts as a transcriptional activator for the NMHC-A gene via an ISRE in the 32kb-150 enhancer region located in intron 1. Analyses of reporter gene expression, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays provide strong evidence supporting the idea that IRF-2 and the 32kb-150 region play an important role in 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced activation of the NMHC-A gene during differentiation of promyelocytic cells to the macrophage lineage. Plasmid Construction—Luciferase reporter genes were constructed using two plasmids, pGL2basic and pGL3basic (Promega), as host vectors. The core promoter luciferase reporter gene containing the 173-bp core promoter of the human NMHC-A gene has been described previously (19Kawamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15101-15110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 32kb-150 fragment (for sequence, see Fig. 1B) was generated by PCR using the human NMHC-A genomic clone as a template and inserted upstream of the core promoter. The 32kb-150 fragment with the mutated ISRE (for sequence, see Fig. 2A) was generated by recombinant PCR using appropriate primers, which include the mutated sequences. Three copies of the wild-type and mutated ISRE were prepared by annealing two complementary strands of oligonucleotides. The upper strand of each sequence of oligonucleotides is as follows: wild-type (5′-c(ATTTACTTTCAGTTTCATCA)3ggtac-3′) and mutant (5′-c(ATTTACTGGAGTACGATTCA)3ggtac-3′). Underlined and lowercase letters represent mutated sequences and cohesive end sequences of a KpnI site, respectively. The resulting double-stranded oligonucleotides with the cohesive ends of the restriction site were then inserted upstream of the core promoter. The full-length coding regions of the cDNAs for IRF-1 and -2 were obtained from human leukocyte cDNA libraries by PCR and inserted into the eukaryotic expression vector pCS3+MT (21Chung M.C. Kim H.K. Kawamoto S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8887-8897Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), which contains a myc-tag sequence. Defined deletions of the mutant IRF-2 cDNAs were generated by PCR using appropriate primers targeted to specific regions of the IRF-2 cDNA (Fig. 6, ΔAB, ΔB). The mutant IRF-2 cDNA with an internal deletion (Fig. 6, ΔA) was created by recombinant PCR. The fidelity of all constructs was verified by DNA sequencing.Fig. 2Activation of the NMHC-A promoter via an ISRE in the 32kb-150 region.

J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15101-15110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HeLa and HL-60 cells were maintained in minimal essential medium α (Invitrogen) and RPMI 1640, respectively, containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics in a 5% CO2/air environment at 37 °C. Transient Transfection and Enzyme Assays—NIH3T3 and HeLa cells were transfected in a 6-well plate using a calcium-phosphate-DNA precipitation method. In brief, 1 × 105 cells were transfected with the indicated amount of the pCS3+MT expression constructs or empty vector, 2 μg of luciferase reporter construct (pGL2), and 0.2 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase (pCMV-β-Gal). Total amounts of transfected DNAs were adjusted to be constant by addition of the empty vector. Transfected cells were harvested in a reporter lysis buffer (Promega), and the activities of luciferase and β-galactosidase were measured using the substrate mixtures from Promega in a microplate luminometer (Tropix TR717; Applied Biosystems) and a microplate reader (SpectraMAX plus; Molecular Devices), respectively. HL-60 cells were transiently transfected by an electroporation method. Luciferase reporter constructs (pGL3) with pCMV-β-Gal were transfected into 0.5∼1.0 × 107 cells using an Amaxa Nucleofector (Amaxa Biosystems) with solution V at T-24 according to the manufacturer's recommendations. After overnight culture, cells were divided, and then TPA or vehicle was added to the culture at a final concentration of 10 nm. Luciferase activity was measured after an additional 24 h of incubation, as described above. Electrophoresis Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—The wild-type and mutant ISRE target DNAs for EMSA were prepared by annealing two complementary strands of oligonucleotides. The upper strand of each sequence of oligonucleotides was as follows: wild-type (5′-gaagatctATTTACTTTCAGTTTCATCAggatcccg-3′) and mutant (5′-gaagatctATTTACTTGAGTACGATTCAggatcccg-3′). Underlined and lowercase letters represent mutated sequences and adaptor sequences, including restriction enzymes, respectively. DNA probes were generated by 5′ end labeling using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Nuclear extracts from NIH3T3 and HeLa cells were prepared as described previously (20Beohar N. Kawamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9168-9178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts from HL-60 cells not treated or treated with 10 nm TPA or 100 units/ml IFN-γ were prepared by using a lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The lysates were centrifuged in a microcentrifuge for 5 min, and the supernatants were dialyzed in the same buffer as that used for binding reactions (see below) but without poly(dI-dC). Binding reactions were carried out in a 10-μl mixture that contained 3-5 μg of nuclear extracts, 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC), 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 4% glycerol. For competition experiments, the unlabeled DNA was preincubated for 15 min at room temperature before addition of the probe. For antibody supershift experiments, indicated antibodies were preincubated for 15 min at room temperature before addition of the probe. After additional incubation with the probe for 20 min, the reaction mixtures were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 6% DNA retardation gel (Invitrogen). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay and Quantification by Real-time PCR—ChIP assays were performed using a chromatin immunoprecipitation kit (Upstate Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. In brief, 2-5 × 106 HL-60 cells were treated with 10 nm TPA for the indicated times (see Fig. 9), and the proteins bound to DNA were subsequently cross-linked by addition of formaldehyde to the culture medium to a final concentration of 1% and then incubated for 20 min. The fixed cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline containing a protease inhibitor mixture and resuspended in a SDS lysis buffer. The cell lysates were sonicated for 10 s at 30% of maximum power. After the samples were diluted 10-fold with ChIP dilution buffer, 2 ml of diluted samples were precleaned by addition of 80 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein A agarose-50% slurry. Precleaned samples were immunoprecipitated at 4 °C overnight with antibodies specific for IRF-1, IRF-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), acetylated histone H3, or acetylated histone H4 (Upstate Biotechnology). After deproteination with proteinase K digestion and reversal of cross-links, the presence of selected DNA sequences was assessed either by conventional PCR or by real-time PCR. The primers used for amplification of the 200-bp fragment, including the 32kb-150 region of the endogenous NMHC-A gene in human HL-60 cells, were as follows: 5′-AGATCCATATGATGTTTGTGG-3′ and 5′-CCAGTCCAACTCCAAGAAACC-3′. For analysis of endogenous protein binding to the 32kb-150 region of the luciferase reporter constructs transfected in NIH3T3 or HL-60 cells, the same ChIP protocol was applied with the exception of PCR primers 5′-TGTATCTTATGGTACTGTAACTG-3′ and 5′-CAAGCAGTTGCCTTTTTAGG-3′. This primer set amplifies the 220-bp fragment, which is specific to the reporter sequence, including a part of the vector sequence, but does not amplify the endogenous sequence. To determine the relative amounts of the co-immunoprecipitated DNA fragments, real-time quantitative PCR was performed using a QuantiTech probe PCR kit (Qiagen) in a Prism 7900HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). The primers used were the same as those for the conventional PCR. The amplified PCR products were monitored by a TaqMan minor groove binder probe (Applied Biosystems) specific to the 32kb-150 region, which has a 5′-fluorophore (6-carboxyfluorescein) and a 3′ minor groove binder non-fluorescent quencher (5′-6-carboxyfluorescein-TCATTTCCTGAGAGTCCTA-MGBNFQ-3′). The PCR reactions containing 0.4 μm concentrations of primers and 0.2 μm concentration of the reporter probe were performed in triplicate under the following conditions: 50 °C for 2 min and 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of PCR consisting of 15 s for 95 °C and 60 s for 60 °C. The emission intensity of the reporter dye was divided by the emission intensity of the internal passive reference dye, and the resulting value was defined as the Rn (normalized reporter). ΔRn was calculated by subtracting the Rn value of the reaction without template or the reaction at the early cycles from the Rn value of the reaction with template. The threshold cycle (CT) value was defined as the PCR cycle number at which PCR amplification reaches the threshold ΔRn value. The CT value of each experimental sample was converted to the relative DNA amounts by comparison with a standard curve. The standard curve was established for each amplification by inputting serial dilutions of the 32kb-150 reporter gene construct. The relative amounts of the co-immunoprecipitated DNA with specific antibodies were calculated by subtracting the DNA amounts of the negative control sample obtained in the absence of antibodies from those of the sample immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies. Northern and Western Blot Analyses—Total RNA was isolated from HL-60 cells cultured in the absence or presence of 10 nm TPA using an RNeasy RNA isolation mini kit (Qiagen). Fifteen μg of total RNA was separated by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde. The gel was blotted onto a nylon membrane, and hybridization was carried out with 32P-labeled probes: the full-length coding region of the IRF-1 and IRF-2 cDNAs and the 1.8 kb fragment of the 3′ coding region of the human NMHC-A cDNA. For analysis of proteins in HL-60 cells cultured in the presence of 10 nm TPA (Fig. 7B), the cells were harvested directly in a 1× SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. The samples were subjected to electrophoresis using a 4-12% polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Antibodies specific for IRF-1 and IRF-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and NMHC-A (17Phillips C.L. Yamakawa K. Adelstein R.S. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1995; 16: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) were used for detection with the SuperSignal System (Pierce Chemical Co.). The Conserved 32 kb Downstream Intronic Region Containing an ISRE in the NMHC-A Gene Exhibits Enhancer Activity—To understand the transcriptional regulation of the human NMHC-A gene, we have searched for regulatory elements in the region extending 20 kb upstream and 40 kb downstream of the transcriptional start sites, which includes the 39 kb intron 1, by reporter gene analysis and followed by data base analysis. A 150 bp region ∼32 kb downstream from the transcriptional start sites, designated 32kb-150, was found to enhance NMHC-A promoter activity as described below in detail (see Fig. 2). Data base analysis also revealed that this region was highly conserved in sequence among humans, mice, and rats. Fig. 1A shows a comparison of the human NMHC-A genomic sequence with that of mice in the region spanning exon 1 to exon 3, using a Vista program. The peak height represents percentage identity for each 100 bp. In addition to three exonic regions, a number of intronic regions show high homology. Among them, a homology at the region ∼32 kb downstream of exon 1 is remarkable, having 93% identity. The same homology peak in this region was also observed in a comparison between human and rat sequences (data not shown). This region consists of 156 bp and the sequence alignment by a Blast 2 program is shown in Fig. 1B. This peak region and the 32kb-150 region overlap by 121 bp. It is noteworthy that an ISRE is embedded in the middle of the 32kb-150 region. The effects of the 32kb-150 fragment on transcriptional activity were examined by reporter gene analysis. A copy of the 32kb-150 fragment was inserted upstream to the NMHC-A core promoter in the luciferase reporter construct, and"
https://openalex.org/W1965245606,"CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT) is a rate-determining enzyme in the de novo synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho). Alveolar type II cells synthesize large quantities of disaturated PtdCho, the surface-active agent of pulmonary surfactant, particularly at late gestation when the lung prepares itself for postnatal air breathing. To clarify the role of CCTα in lung surfactant maturation, we overexpressed CCTα1-367 using the surfactant protein-C promoter. Lungs of transgenic mice were analyzed at day 18 of gestation (term = 19 days). Overexpression of CCTα1-367 increased the synthesis and content of PtdCho in fetal type II cells isolated from the transgenic mice. Also, PtdCho content of fetal lung fluid was increased. No changes in surfactant protein content were detected. Interestingly, fetal type II cells of transgenic mice contained more glycogen than control cells. Incorporation studies with [U-14C]glucose demonstrated that overexpression of CCTα1-367 in fetal type II cells increased glycogen synthesis without affecting glycogen breakdown. To determine which domain contributes to this glycogen phenotype, two additional transgenes were created overexpressing either CCTα1-239 or CCTα239-367. Glycogen synthesis and content were increased in fetal type II cells expressing CCTα239-367 but not CCTα1-239. We conclude that overexpression of CCTα increases surfactant PtdCho synthesis without affecting surfactant protein levels but that it disrupts glycogen metabolism in differentiating type II cells via its regulatory domain.

In dividing cells, large quantities of phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) 1The abbreviations used are: PtdCho, phosphatidylcholine; CCTα, CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase; SPA, -B, and -C, surfactant protein A, B, and C; M, membrane domain; P, phosphorylation; MEM, minimal essential medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; LCM, laser capture microscopy. are required for membrane synthesis. The lung also requires a steady synthesis of PtdCho for pulmonary surfactant, a lipoprotein that is synthesized and secreted by the alveolar type II epithelial cell into the thin liquid layer that lines the epithelium (1Goerke J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1408: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). One of the functions of pulmonary surfactant is to reduce surface tension at the air-liquid interface of the alveoli during expiration. This surface-active function requires sufficient amounts of dipalmitoyl-PtdCho (1Goerke J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1408: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Deficiencies of surfactant have been associated with a variety of lung diseases, including respiratory distress syndrome in premature neonates, which is the most common respiratory disorder of premature infants. The production of surfactant is set into gear during the latter part of gestation (2Post M. Smith B.T. Robertson B. van Golde L.M. Batenburg J.J. Pulmonary Surfactant: From Molecular Biology to Clinical Practice. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1992: 379-424Google Scholar). How maturing type II cells are able to increase and direct their PtdCho production toward pulmonary surfactant at late gestation without compromising PtdCho demand for membrane biogenesis and homeostasis remains unknown. The major pathway for de novo synthesis of PtdCho in most mammalian cells is the CDP-choline pathway. Output from this pathway is determined by the activity of the rate-limiting enzyme CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT), which catalyzes the formation of CDP-choline from phosphocholine (3Vance D.E. Vance D.E. Vance J. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins, and Membranes. 4th Ed. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam2002: 205-232Google Scholar). The mammalian genome contains two CCT genes that encode four isoforms (4Karim M. Jackson P. Jackowski S. Biochim. Biophys.

The α isoform (CCTα) is ubiquitously expressed, whereas the three β isoforms (CCTβ1, -2, and -3) are more restricted in distribution (4Karim M. Jackson P. Jackowski S. Biochim. Biophys.

Although the particular role of CCTβ is not understood, the overlapping expression suggests that CCTβ acts to augment PtdCho production in certain cell types. CCTα is the predominant isoform in the fetal and adult lung, and its expression and activity increases during the latter part of gestation (7Mallampalli R.K. Ryan A.J. Salome R.G. Jackowski S. J.

The N terminus contains a well characterized nuclear localization signal (10Wang Y. Sweitzer T.D. Weinhold P.A. Kent C. J. Biol.

The catalytic domain is flanked on the C terminus by membrane (M) binding and phosphorylation (P) domains.

Chem. 1991; 266: 21113-21117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18MacDonald J.I. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10529-10537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Increased phosphorylation is associated with decreased membrane binding and, therefore, decreased activity (17Watkins J.D. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21113-21117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Watkins J.D. Wang Y.L. Kent C. Arch. Biochem.

Little is known about which kinases and phosphatases target CCTα and what role they play in modulating CCTα activity. The unusual requirements of the developing lung for PtdCho synthesis and, therefore, CCT activity suggest a unique mechanism of regulation of CCTα in differentiating type II cells. In the present study we hypothesized that an increased CCTα activity in fetal type II cells would accelerate the maturation of the surfactant system in the developing lung. We overexpressed full-length and truncated CCTα domains in maturing type II cells using the surfactant protein (SP)-C promoter. There was an enhanced surfactant PtdCho production without a change in surfactant protein levels. However, the most striking feature of these mice was that CCTα overexpression led to increased glycogen content in the maturing type II cells. This contrasts the normal decline in glycogen content with increased surfactant synthesis at late gestation (21Rinaudo M.T. Curto M. Bruno R. Ponzetto C. Int. J. Biochem. 1981; 13: 571-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 22Brehier A. Rooney S.A. Exp. Lung Res. 1981; 2: 273-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The increased glycogen content was dependent on the presence of the regulatory (M and P) domain of CCTα and occurred due to an increase in glycogen synthesis. No change in surfactant proteins was noted. Although no overall acceleration in the maturation of the surfactant system was noted, the results corroborate recent findings (29Ridsdale R. Post M. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2004; 287: 743-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) linking glycogen and surfactant PtdCho metabolism in maturing type II cells via CCTα. Materials—C57BL/6 and SJL mice were obtained from Charles River (St. Constant, Quebec, Canada). Anti-SPA and SPB antibodies were obtained from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Anti-pro-N-SPC antiserum was generously provided by Dr. M. Beers (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA). Epon was purchased from Marivac (Montreal, Quebec, Canada). All culture medium was obtained from Invitrogen. Osmium tetroxide and anti-FLAG M2 antibodies were obtained from Sigma). Deuterated choline and phosphocholine were obtained from CDN Isotopes Inc. (Pointe-Claire, Quebec, Canada), whereas deuterated dipalmitoyl-PtdCho (deuterated in choline head group) was obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). [Methyl-14C]choline and [U-14C]glucose were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Transgene Construction—Rat CCTα (9Hogan M. Zimmermann L.J. Wang J. Kuliszewski M. Liu J. Post M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: L25-L32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used as the basis to generate three constructs, each augmented with a FLAG sequence (DYKD-DDDK) at the C terminus. The first construct encompassed the full translated sequence for CCTα (CCTα1-367), the second truncated construct contained the N terminus and the catalytic domain (CCTα1-239), and the third construct was composed of the membrane (M) and phosphorylation (P) domains (CCTα203-367) (Fig. 1a). The resultant 1.2-, 0.8-, and 0.5-kilobase FLAG-tagged CCTα cDNAs were subcloned 3′ of the 3.7-kilobase human SPC promoter (23Korfhagen T.R. Glasser S.W. Wert S.E. Bruno M.D. Daugherty C.C. McNeish J.D. Stock J.L. Potter S.S. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6122-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and 5′ of the SV40 small T intron and polyadenylation sequences. The SPC-CCTα-FLAG expression cassettes were excised with NdeI and NotI, purified using Glass Milk (Gene Clean Kit Bio101, BioCan, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) and Elutip-D columns (Schleier and Schuell, NY, NY, USA), and ethanol-precipitated. Production of Transgenic Mice—Transgenic embryos were generated according to Hogan et al. (24Hogan B. Bedington R. Constantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. 2 Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). DNA injections into the pronuclei of (C57BL/6 × SJL) F2 embryos were carried out at a concentration of 3 ng/μl. The genotype was established by PCR analysis of genomic DNA extracted from the embryonic tail (Fig. 1b) and confirmed by Southern blot analysis. The primers used were 5′-TCACCTCTGTCCCCTCTCCCTACG-3′ (SPC primer for 5′) and either 5′-TGCCTGCTTCCTTGATGTGCTTAT-3′ (CCTα1-367 primer for 3′), 5′-GCCGCCGTCCCCTTCTCCAT-3′ (CCTα1-239 primer for 3′), or 5′-TGAACAGACTGTGAGTGAG-3′ (CCTα203-367 primer for 3′). The annealing temperature was 60 °C for CCTα1-367, 58 °C for CCTα203-367, and 53 °C for CCTα1-239. A total of 35 cycles were used for amplification. Mice were bred to homozygosity. To allow for comparison of expression between transgenes carrying different constructs, exogenous CCTα protein expression was determined by immunoblotting using anti-FLAG antibodies. Only mice showing comparable expression levels of protein in the lung were used in the analysis. Choline and Glucose Incorporation—Timed pregnant litters were obtained by breeding either negative male and female C57BL/6 mice or homozygous transgenic male and negative C57BL/6 female mice. Detection of coitus was determined by the appearance of a vaginal plug that was designated day 0 of gestation (E0), and fetuses were harvested at E18 of gestation (term = day 19). Lungs were dissected from the fetuses, and distal epithelial type II cells were isolated (25Caniggia I. Tseu I. Han R.N. Smith B.T. Tanswell K. Post M. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: L424-L433PubMed Google Scholar). Purity of the epithelial cell cultures as determined by proSPC staining was >70%. After a 48-h culture, cells were rinsed with serum-free minimal essential medium (MEM) and incubated with choline-free MEM media containing 1 μCi/ml [methyl-3H]choline. After 4 h of incubation, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed with Hanks' balanced medium, trypsinized, and counted, and cellular lipids were extracted according to the method of Bligh and Dyer (26Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42863) Google Scholar). Lipid samples were dried under nitrogen, and radioactivity was quantified using a scintillation counter. To investigate the synthesis of glycogen, cells were incubated in glucose-free MEM containing 1 μCi/ml [U-14C]glucose. After a 2-24-h incubation period, medium was removed, and cells were washed with Hanks' balanced medium, trypsinized, and counted. To determine glycogen degradation, cells were incubated for 2 h with 5 μCi/ml [U-14C]glucose in glucose-free MEM. After this pulse period, cells were extensively washed with normal MEM and then incubated for 0-48 h in normal MEM medium. At timed intervals cellular reactions were stopped by washing and trypsinizing the cells. Glycogen was isolated as previously described (27Carlson K.S. Davies P. Smith B.T. Post M. Pediatr. Res. 1987; 22: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and radioactivity was quantified using a scintillation counter. Glycogen synthase activity in whole lung homogenates or isolated fetal type II cells was assayed in the forward direction by measuring the rate of incorporation of UDP-d-[U-14C]glucose into glycogen (28Buettner R. Ottinger I. Scholmerich J. Bollheimer L.C. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 286: 828-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Electron Microscopy—Lung tissue removed from fetuses was rinsed in 1 unit/ml heparin in PBS to remove blood and minced in ∼1-mm pieces. For routine electron microscopy the tissue was fixed for 1 h in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and 1% (w/v) glutaraldehyde in PBS. Tissues were then rinsed 3 times in PBS and exposed to 1% (w/v) osmium tetroxide for 1 h followed by another three rinses with PBS. The samples were then dehydrated through an ascending alcohol series ending in propylene oxide. Propylene oxide was then exchanged with an increasing concentration of Epon (Marivac, St. Laurent, Quebec, Canada) until the samples were fully infiltrated with 100% Epon. Samples were placed in molds, and the Epon was polymerized at 70 °C overnight. For immunogold electron microscopy the tissue was processed as described previously (29Ridsdale R. Post M. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2004; 287: 743-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Ultrathin sections of the resulting blocks were cut using a diamond knife on a Reichert Ultracut microtome to gold thickness and placed onto 400-mesh copper grids or nickel-plated grids for immunogold. Immunogold labeling was performed as previously (29Ridsdale R. Post M. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2004; 287: 743-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) using a 1:200 diluted anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) followed by a 1:300 diluted 10-nm gold-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Nanoprobes, Yaphank, NY). All samples were stained for 10 min in 3% (w/v) uranyl acetate in double-distilled water and 5 min in 1% (w/v) lead citrate followed by double wash distilled water to remove the excess stain. Samples were examined on a Philips 430 electron microscope. Glycogen Content—Glycogen content was determined according to Seifter et al. (30Seifter S. Novic B. Muntwyler E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1950; 25: 191-200PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, fetal lungs dissected from genotyped fetuses were individually boiled in 100 μl of 30% KOH for 30 min. The resulting slurry was diluted with 1.5 ml of distilled water. A 0.4-μl aliquot of each sample was added to 800 μl of 0.2% (w/v) anthrone reagent in 95% sulfuric acid. Samples were boiled for 10 min and cooled, and absorbance was read at 620 nm using a Beckman UV spectrophotometer. Immunoblot Analysis—Three CCTα positive and three negative E18 lungs were rinsed with PBS and lysed in homogenization buffer using a Dounce homogenizer. Homogenates were diluted in Laemmli loading buffer to a final concentration of 25 μg/μl protein and then boiled for 5 min. Samples (60 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel and then electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubating the nitrocellulose membrane with 3% (w/v) dry skim milk in Tris-buffered saline at 4 °C for 60 min, and the membrane was then treated with the specified primary antibody (see “Results”). After overnight incubation at 4 °C, the nitrocellulose membrane was washed 3 times with Tris-buffered saline plus % Tween 20) followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:20,000) for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were then washed thoroughly with cold Tris-buffered saline plus Tween 20 (5 × 5 min), and bands were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Cytidylyltransferase Assay—Lungs were collected and homogenized in homogenization buffer of 145 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaF, and 2.5 mm EDTA. Postmitochondrial supernatant and membrane-rich and cytosolic fractions were obtained as previously described (31Zimmermann L.J. Hogan M. Carlson K.S. Smith B.T. Post M. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: L575-L580PubMed Google Scholar, 32Houweling M. Jamil H. Hatch G.M. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7544-7551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Measurement of Choline-containing Metabolites—The aqueous phase remaining after lipid extraction from fetal lung tissue was used to determine the choline metabolites (33Koc H. Mar M.H. Ranasinghe A. Swenberg J.A. Zeisel S.H. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 4734-4740Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 200-μl aliquot of the aqueous layer was spiked with 5 nm deuterated choline and phosphocholine and subjected to liquid chromatography on a Altech Absorbo-sphere silica column fitted with a Altech Solvent Miser Silica guard column (Deerfield, IL), and peaks were analyzed by an API4000 triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer (MDS SCIEX, Concord, On, Canada) using multiple reaction monitoring and quantified by Analyst 1.2 software (MDS SCIEX). Fetal Lung Liquid Lavage—E18 pregnant mice were euthanized with diethyl ether, and fetuses were extracted by caesarian section. With the aid of a dissecting microscope, a thoracotomy was performed to expose the lungs, and a 30-gauge needle (with a blunted tip) was inserted through a tracheostomy. The fluid-filled lungs were lavaged with 50 μl of PBS containing 0.05 mg/ml 70-kDa dextran-FITC (PBS/dextran-FITC) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The recovered lung liquid was diluted with PBS/dextran-FITC to a final volume of 200 μl. A standard curve was generated using PBS/dextran-FITC and PBS alone and compared with lung liquid samples to correlate loss of FITC signal with a volume of diluted PBS/dextran-FITC. Samples were measured fluorometrically using a Molecular Devices SpectraMax Gemini electron microscope (Sunnyvale, CA). This provided an accurate measurement of the volume of fetal lung liquid obtained by the lavage method. Laser Capture Microscopy (LCM)—Optimal cutting temperature compound frozen lung sections from control and transgenic mice were fixed with 75% (v/v) ethanol, rehydrated, stained with rabbit pro-SPC antibody diluted in normal goat serum followed by FITC-anti rabbit IgG, and then dehydrated. Alveolar type II cells identified by pro-SPC immunofluorescence were dissected using a PixCell II System (Arcturus Engineering, Mountain View, CA), and the RNA was extracted. For mass spectral analysis of PtdCho, sections were fixed with 3% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 5 min. These sections were then rinsed in distilled water for 5 min. Excess water was removed, and the tissue was rapidly frozen on dry ice. Tissues were thawed in distilled water and stained with rabbit pro-SPC antibody diluted in 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin followed by FITC-anti rabbit IgG. The tissue was washed, rapidly frozen on dry ice, and immediately freeze-dried for 1 h. Alveolar type II cells were captured as described above. Real-time Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from the LCM-captured type II cells using the PicoPure RNA isolation kit (Arcturus Engineering). After DNase I treatment, total RNA was reverse-transcribed using random hexamers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The resulting templates (20 ng of cDNA for our target genes and 2 ng for 18 S) were quantified by real-time PCR (ABI Prism 7700, Foster City, CA). Primers and TaqMan probes for CCTα were purchased from Applied Biosystems as Assays-on-Demand™ (Foster City, CA). A dilution series determined the efficiency of amplification, allowing the relative quantification method to be employed (34Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (124738) Google Scholar). For relative quantitation, PCR signals were compared between groups after normalization using 18 S as an internal reference. -Fold change was calculated according to Livak and Schmittgen (34Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (124738) Google Scholar). Mass Spectral Analysis of PtdCho—Homogenized tissues, fetal lung liquid material, or microdissected type II cells were spiked with 2.5 nm deuterated dipalmitoyl-PtdCho as an internal standard and then extracted by a two-step Bligh and Dyer (26Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42863) Google Scholar). For lipid analysis the chloroform layers were removed and dried under nitrogen gas. Samples were then reconstituted in 200 μl of 3:1 chloroform/methanol, and 30 μl was injected by auto-sampler into an API4000 triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer (MDS SCIEX). Individual PtdCho species were detected at M+1 and M+Na in positive mode and quantified from the common phosphocholine daughter ion at 184 m/z (193 m/z for the internal standard). Statistics—All values are shown as the means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was done by Student's t test or, for comparison of more than two groups, by one-way analysis of variance followed by Duncan's multiple range comparison test, with significance defined as p < 0.05. CCTα Expression in Transgenic Mice Lungs—To establish a role for CCTα in regulating pulmonary surfactant formation during late fetal development, we expressed FLAG-tagged full-length CCTα1-367 in lung epithelial type II cells using the SPC enhancer/promoter. Western blot analysis using monoclonal FLAG M2 antibodies demonstrated exogenous CCTα-FLAG expression in the E18 transgenic lungs, whereas no expression was noted in the lungs of littermate wild type controls (Fig. 1b). As anticipated, CCTα-FLAG protein expression at E18 was restricted to the distal lung epithelial cells of the transgene (Fig. 1b). Overexpression of full-length CCTα in distal lung epithelial cells caused no embryonic or postnatal lethality. The transgenic mice were in no obvious distress. No differences were observed in body or lung weight between wild type and transgenic mice (results not shown). CCT Activity in CCTα1-367 Transgenic Lungs—E18 fetal lung were fractionated by centrifugation, and CCTα activity was measured. The postmitochondrial (3,000 × g) and membrane-enriched (300,000 × g) pellet of transgenic lungs displayed a significantly greater CCT activity than those of littermate control lungs (Fig. 2a). Examination of the soluble choline metabolites from the fetal lung tissue indicated that there was a significant decrease in phosphocholine content of E18 transgenic lungs compared with littermate controls with no significant changes in the amount of choline and CDP-choline (Fig. 2b). This increased consumption of phosphocholine supports the idea of an increased flux through the reaction catalyzed by CCTα. The amount of glycerophosphocholine, a breakdown product of PtdCho, was not different between transgenic and control lungs (Fig. 2b). Choline Incorporation and PtdCho Content in Type II Cells of CCTα1-367 Transgenic Lungs—Because the SPC promoter restricts CCTα protein expression to the distal epithelial cells of the lung, we measured radioactive choline incorporation into PtdCho and PtdCho content in E18 epithelial type II cells (Fig. 3). First, we found using laser capture microscopy (Fig. 3a) and real-time PCR (Fig. 3b) that E18 type II cells of transgenic mice had a 6-fold greater CCT mRNA expression than E18 type II cells from control mice. For [methyl-3H]choline incorporation studies, multiple litters had to be pooled to provide sufficient cell numbers. Progeny of CCTα negative parents produced wild type (control) cell cultures, whereas progeny of homozygous transgenic males and negative females were used to obtain enriched fetal epithelial type II cell cultures in which 100% of the epithelial cells overexpressed CCTα. In agreement with the aforementioned increased mRNA expression and CCT activity, choline incorporation into total lipids of E18 type II cells isolated from the transgenic mice was significantly (>6-fold) greater than that of E18 control type II cell cultures (Fig. 3c). In previous studies we have found that >90% of the radioactive choline incorporated in total lipids is incorporated into PtdCho (36Post M. Batenburg J.J. van Golde L.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 618: 308-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To determine whether this increase in PtdCho synthesis led to increased PtdCho content, we quantitatively assessed PtdCho in LCM-dissected E18 type II cells using tandem mass spectrometry. In line with the increased PtdCho synthesis, E18 type II cells of transgenic mice had an ∼2-fold greater dipalmitoyl-PtdCho content compared with cells of control mice (Fig. 3d). PtdCho Content in CCTα1-367 Transgenic Lungs—To determine whether the increase in CCTα expression and activity of E18 type II cells also resulted in an increase in surfactant PtdCho content, we isolated fetal lung liquid fluid from E18 mice and with the aid of tandem mass spectrometry quantitatively analyzed the PtdCho molecular species of both fetal lung liquid and residual lung tissue (Fig. 4). Although a moderate increase in dipalmitoyl-PtdCho content was observed"
https://openalex.org/W2002102169,"Serum amyloid A-activating transcription factor-1 (SAF-1) plays a major role in regulating transcription of several inflammation-responsive genes, including SAA and matrix metalloproteinase-1, that are implicated in the pathogenesis of reactive secondary amyloidosis, atherosclerosis, and arthritis. SAF-1 is a 477-amino acid protein with six zinc fingers. Its activation during inflammatory condition by a phosphorylation event that leads to an altered structure suggested possible structural modification of this protein as a leading cause of higher activity. However, no information is available regarding structural features that might regulate its activity. Here, we have characterized its functional domains, delineating activation and repression modules, DNA binding, and nuclear localization activities. Using GAL4AD chimeras and a DNA-binding assay with proteins prepared from various deletion constructs, the core DNA-binding domain of SAF-1 is mapped between amino acids 282 and 361, which contain second, third, and fourth zinc fingers. Results from several deletion and point mutants using green fluorescent protein reporter show that SAF-1 contains two independent nuclear localization signals; one is composed of a stretch of basic amino acids, and the other is a bipartite signal located within the core DNA-binding domain. SAF-1 contains several negative and positively functioning transactivation modules clustered at the two ends of this protein. Removal of any one of the terminal negative modules renders the SAF-1 protein functionally very active. These findings suggest that the terminal repression modules act in conjunction to regulate the functional activity of this protein.

Several reports have shown that SAF-1 is activated in response to several mediators of signal transduction (6Ray B.K. Chatterjee S. Ray A. DNA Cell Biol. 1999; 18: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 18Ray B.K. Chen J. Ray A. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 2343-2348Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 19Ray A. Yu G.Y.

Chem. 2000; 275: 39727-39733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These studies have suggested that structural modification, as a result of phosphorylation, leads to increased activity of SAF-1. Truncated SAF-1 protein has also been shown to be functionally more active compared with the native protein, indicating that structure plays a critical part in determining activity of this protein (20Ray A. Ray P. Guthrie N. Shakya A. Kumar D. Ray B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22586-22595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In order to fully understand the role of SAF-1 in the induction of target gene expression under pathophysiological conditions, it is important to identify different structural features of this protein. To date, little is known as to how SAF-1 recognizes and binds to the promoter, its transactivation properties, or how it gains access to the nucleus to function as a transcription factor. Since regulation of many transcription factors is mediated by the availability of their functional modules, determining the functional modules of SAF-1 is a critical issue in understanding how SAF-1 functions as a transcriptional activator. In this study, we used a combination of in vivo and in vitro analyses to identify the domains involved in DNA binding, nuclear localization, and transcriptional activation. This report identifies a novel mechanism of regulation of SAF-1. Cell Culture and Transfection—Rabbit synoviocyte (HIG82) cells, obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, were derived from the interarticular soft tissue of the knee joint of a normal female New Zealand White rabbit. These cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing high glucose (4.5 g/liter) supplemented with 7% fetal calf serum. Transient transfections of HIG82 cells were carried out using the calcium phosphate method (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The amount of DNA in each transfection assay was kept the same by using carrier DNA. Reporter plasmids and the eucaryotic expression vectors containing various fragments of SAF-1 cDNA were transfected in amounts as indicated in the figure legends along with 1 μg of pSV-β-gal (Promega). The pSV-β-gal plasmid DNA was used as an internal control for measuring transfection efficiency. Cells were harvested 24 h post-transfection, and CAT activity in the cell extracts was determined as described previously (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activity was assayed with the substrate o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as described (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Cell extracts containing equivalent amounts of β-galactosidase activity were used for a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assay. Prior to the CAT assay, each cell extract was heated at 60 °C for 10 min to inactivate endogenous acetylase. The agents used in transfection assays had no effect on β-galactosidase expression. All transfection experiments were performed at least three times. Reporter Plasmids—The SAF-CAT reporter plasmid was constructed by ligating three tandem copies of the SAF-binding element of the rabbit SAA gene (2Ray A. Ray B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7327-7335Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) into pBLCAT2 vector (23Luckow B. Schutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). The sequence of the SAF-binding element was 5′-CCCTTCCTCTCCACCCACAGCCCCCATGG-3′. For activation domain analysis, a reporter CAT gene with minimum basal activity was chosen (24Lillie J.W. Green M.R. Nature. 1989; 338: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). This plasmid, GAL4E1bCAT, containing five copies of the 17-bp GAL4 binding site (UASG) in front of the adenovirus minimal E1b promoter, was a gift from Erik Flemington. For the analysis of the repressor module, GAL4tkCAT (25Shi Y. Seto E. Chang L.S. Shenk T. Cell. 1991; 67: 377-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar), which has much higher basal activity, was chosen. GAL4tkCAT was prepared by linking five copies of the 17-bp GAL4 binding site in front of the pBLCAT2 vector (23Luckow B. Schutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar) that contains the minimal tk promoter of the thymidine kinase gene of herpes simplex virus. Subcloning of SAF-1 Fragments—Wild-type SAF-1 and its deletion mutants were constructed initially in plasmid vector pTZ19U (Invitrogen) and further subcloned into expression vectors pRSET (Invitrogen) and pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Deletion fragments of SAF-1 were generated by PCR using appropriate oligonucleotides ∼35 bp in length. In order to amplify the GC-rich sequences present in the SAF-1 sequence, GC-melt (BD Biosciences Clontech) was added to the PCR mixture. PCR products were subcloned in pTZ19U vector and sequenced for verification of the correct identity of each deletion construct. An internal deletion of SAF-1(Δ193–414) was created by PCR amplification of two segments, 1–192 and 415–477 amino acids of SAF-1, followed by ligation of these two fragments and cloning in pTZ19U. Similarly, SAF-1-(142–477)(Δ193–213) was created by PCR amplification of two segments, 142–192 and 214–477 amino acids of SAF-1 and ligation of the two fragments into pTZ19U. For transient transfection to express proteins in cultured cells, full-length and truncated SAF-1 sequences were subcloned in the pcDNA3 vector. Construction of GAL4DBDSAF-1 Plasmids—Plasmid RSV-GAL4DBD (26Flemington E.K. Speck S.H. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6914-6918Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), encoding the DNA-binding domain (DBD) located within amino acids 1–147 of the yeast GAL4 gene, was used to prepare the GAL4DBDSAF-1 construct. Full-length SAF-1 cDNA and deleted SAF-1 fragments were fused in frame C-terminal to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (GAL4DBD) at the unique BamHI site. The resulting clones were verified by DNA sequence analysis. Construction of GAL4ADSAF-1 Plasmids—A 514-bp HindIII-XhoI fragment, containing the GAL4 activation domain was isolated from pACT2 plasmid (BD Biosciences Clontech) and ligated to pcDNA3 vector at HindIII and XhoI sites. This fragment contains a nuclear localization signal, KKKRK, consisting of a stretch of basic amino acids. This plasmid, designated as pcDGAL4AD, contains a cytomegalovirus immediate early enhancer/promoter that drives transcription of the GAL4AD gene. Full-length SAF-1 cDNA and deleted SAF-1 fragments were fused in frame at the C terminus of GAL4AD at the unique BamHI and XbaI sites. SAF-1 derivatives, ADSAF-1-(282–361)ZFmut, with mutations located either within zinc finger 2, 3, or 4, designated as ZF2, ZF3, and ZF4, were generated by substituting two cysteine residues in each zinc finger with alanine residues. PCR amplification with primers containing mutated bases replacing the cysteine codon (TGC and TGT) with an alanine codon (GCC) was used to create the desired mutations. For ligation of N- and C-terminal regions of SAF-1 to the ZF2-ZF4 domain to construct ADSAF-1-(282–361)N+C Tag plasmid, DNA sequences corresponding to amino acids 1–89 and 415–477 of SAF-1 were ligated in frame to that of amino acids 282–361. The resulting clones were verified by DNA sequencing. Construction of SAF1-GFP Chimeras—Full-length, truncated, and mutant sequences of SAF-1 were ligated to the phrGFP-C vector (Stratagene). It should be noted that phrGFP-C vector contains a built-in nuclear localization signal, for which GFP proteins stay in both nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions when cells are transfected with this vector. Truncated and mutated SAF-1 cDNAs were generated by PCR amplification using specific primers with the desired terminal sequences and mutated oligonucleotides to introduce base substitutions at the selected sites. The identity of each construct was verified by DNA sequence analysis. Fluorescence Microscopy for Nuclear Localization Analysis—Hig82 cells, grown in a 24-well plate, were transfected with different SAF-1-GFP plasmid DNAs (0.5 μg of DNA for each plasmid) using the calcium phosphate method (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The live cells in the 24-well plate were visualized 24 h after transfection using an inverted microscope equipped with UV light source and a filter that allows plasmid-derived green fluorescence protein to be visible. The fluorescing cells were photographed at a magnification of ×400. Protein Preparation—To prepare His-tagged proteins, wild-type and truncated SAF-1 cDNAs were subcloned into pRSET vectors. Proteins expressed from these clones were purified by affinity chromatography using a nickel-Sepharose column (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed with equal protein amounts of bacterially expressed proteins according to the methods described previously (2Ray A. Ray B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7327-7335Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were measured by Bradford's method (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217547) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled probe containing the SAF-binding element of the SAA promoter was prepared by using [α-32P]dCTP as the substrate to label the double-stranded oligonucleotide probe (2Ray A. Ray B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7327-7335Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Two complementary oligonucleotides, 5′-GGCTTCCTCTCCACCCACAGCCC-3′ and 3′-CGAAGGAGAGGTGGGTGTCGGGGG-5′, were annealed to prepare the double-stranded SAF-binding element. Western Immunoblot—50 μg of protein from transfected HIG82 cell extracts were fractionated by electrophoresis in an SDS-5%/12% polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with different antibodies as described in the figure legends. Membrane was further incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and chemiluminiscence reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were detected by autoradiography. Inflammation-responsive transcription factor, SAF-1, and its human and mouse homolog, MAZ and Pur-1, regulate a number of genes with diverse cellular functions. Many of these SAF-1/MAZ/Pur-1-regulated genes are activated in different physiological conditions and in different tissues. Inducible nature of SAF-1 and its ability to interact with a well defined promoter element as well as its ability to associate with several other regulatory proteins (15Jordan-Sciutto K.L. Dragich J.M. Caltagarone J. Hall D.J. Bowser R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3206-3215Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 17Ugai H. Li H.O. Komatsu M. Tsutsui H. Song J. Shiga T. Fearon E. Murata T. Yokoyama K.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 1087-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 28Ray A. Schatten H. Ray B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4300-4308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) suggest that different structural components might be involved in performing these diverse functions. To understand the mechanism of SAF-1 action, we sought to identify the functional motifs. The knowledge gained from the analyses of structural motifs of many transcription factors enabled us to predict some of the structural domains of SAF-1 and their functions (Fig. 1). Of the amino-terminal 150 amino acids of SAF-1, 31 residues are proline, including a stretch of 9 prolines located within residues 130–139. In addition, SAF-1 contains a total of three polyalanine tracts. Two of these are located at the N-terminal region between amino acids 89 and 108 and between amino acids 142 and 164. The third polyalanine tract is located at the carboxyl-terminal region between amino acids 436 and 450. SAF-1 also contains a glycine-rich region containing 10 glycine residues within amino acids 244–257 and six potential zinc finger motifs that are of the Cys2-His2 type. In Vivo Mapping of the DNA-binding Region of SAF-1—For gross analysis, we used an in vivo mapping technique in which progressively deleted fragments of SAF-1 were fused to a heterologous activation domain (amino acids 768–881) of yeast GAL4 transcription factor to generate GAL4ADSAF-1 fusion proteins. A nuclear localization signal peptide sequence from SV40 T antigen was placed in-frame upstream of the GAL4AD activation domain for proper nuclear localization of the fusion protein in case the endogenous signal is deleted from the fragment of interest. Expression of the GAL4ADSAF-1 fusion proteins was directed by cytomegalovirus immediate early enhancer/promoter. This fusion approach allows assessment of the DNA-binding ability of the modular domain of a protein without requiring the presence of an activation domain in the same protein. GAL4AD-SAF-1 chimeras were examined for analysis of promoter binding activity by transfecting HIG82 synovial cells and expressing CAT reporter gene (Fig. 2). The CAT reporter, SAF-CAT, contains the SAF binding element placed in front of the minimal tk promoter of pBLCAT2 vector (Fig. 2A), and thus expression of the CAT gene is dependent upon the binding of fusion proteins to this element. To assess the synthesis level of the fusion proteins in the transfected cells, Western immunoblot analysis was performed, which showed a comparable level of synthesis from each plasmid (Fig. 2F). Further analysis by immunofluorescence using anti-GAL4AD antibody showed that these GAL4AD-SAF proteins are localized into nucleus of the transfected cells (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2B, ADSAF-1-(1–477), containing full-length SAF-1 protein, effectively activated transcription of SAF-CAT reporter. However, ADSAF-1-(1–192), containing 192 amino acids from the amino-terminal region of SAF-1, did not exhibit any DNA binding activity. Also, ADSAF-1(Δ193–414), with internal deletion of amino acid residues from 193 to 414, did not activate the reporter. In contrast, the ADSAF-1-(193–414) construct activated SAF-CAT reporter very efficiently. These results indicated that DNA binding activity of SAF-1 resides within amino acids 193–414, containing all six zinc fingers of SAF-1. To determine whether all six zinc fingers are required for optimal DNA-binding and to map the boundaries of functional minimum DNA-binding domain, we prepared several other constructs where individual or combinations of multiple zinc fingers were deleted. Data obtained from these AD-SAF-1 hybrids, shown in Fig. 2B, indicated that regions encompassing amino acids 282–414 and 193–361, represented by ADSAF-1-(282–414) and ADSAF-1-(193–361), with deletion of either the first zinc finger or fifth plus sixth zinc fingers, respectively, were also able to bind quite significantly. Considerable DNA binding activity was also retained by the protein encompassing amino acids 282–361 that contained the second, third, and fourth zinc fingers. In contrast, ADSAF-1-(362–477), containing the fifth and sixth zinc fingers, exhibited almost no DNA binding activity. Thus, minimum functional DNA-binding domain was identified between amino acids 282 and 361 containing the second, third, and fourth zinc fingers. These results are specific, because the cells transfected with GAL4AD vector showed no activity, indicating that the increase in the reporter gene expression is solely due to the DNA-binding ability of attached SAF-1 fragments. Since the minimum DNA-binding domain spanning amino acids 282–361 contains three zinc fingers, the relative significance of each was assessed (Fig. 2C). Mutation of any one of these three zinc fingers reduced the DNA binding activity, suggesting that each zinc finger contributes toward the DNA-binding function of the minimum DNA-binding domain. It was interesting to note that the GAL4AD construct, ADSAF-1-(1–477), containing full-length SAF-1 protein was a relatively inferior transactivator compared with some of its truncated derivatives (Fig. 2B). These results suggested that terminal regions of SAF-1 may have an adverse effect on the minimum DNA-binding domain of SAF-1. To test this possibility, we prepared several constructs in which the surrounding sequence of the minimum DNA-binding domain of SAF-1 was progressively deleted either from the N-terminal or C-terminal region (Fig. 2D). The removal of terminal amino acid sequences 1–89 and 415–477 from N and C termini, respectively, increased the DNA binding activity quite significantly. To test whether the terminal sequences have any effect on the minimum DNA-binding domain of amino acids 282–361 containing zinc fingers 2–4, the N and C termini were ligated in frame with the this region. Compared with ADSAF-1-(282–361), the ADSAF-1-(282–361)N+C tag construct showed much lower activity (Fig. 2E). This finding suggested that terminal sequences of SAF-1 pose a negative effect that could be due to interference with the binding of the protein to the promoter or due to an inhibitory activity of the terminal regions. Further studies, described in the legends to Figs. 4 and 5, revealed an inhibitory activity of the terminal regions.Fig. 5Repression by GAL4SAF-1 chimeras. HIG82 cells were cotransfected with 0.5 μg of the specified GAL4DBDSAF-1 expression plasmids and 1.0 μg of different reporter CAT plasmids as indicated in each panel. A, GAL4tkCAT reporter plasmid is a pBLCAT2-based plasmid containing five copies of the 17-bp GAL4 binding sites placed in front of the minimal thymidine kinase promoter of herpes simplex virus. B, GAL4E1bCAT reporter plasmid containing five copies of the 17-bp GAL4 binding sites placed in front of adenovirus E1b minimal promoter. C, pBLCAT2 reporter plasmid containing sequence from -105 to +51 of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene. CAT activity results shown are averages from three separate experiments, and all activities are presented as relative to that of GAL4tkCAT alone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) DNA-binding Domain of SAF-1—To test whether the region of SAF-1, identified in the above studies, directly and independently interacts with the SAF promoter, in vitro DNA-binding studies were performed using affinity-purified subunits of SAF-1 protein. A DNA-binding assay was performed using equal amounts of these proteins and a radioactively labeled SAF-binding element as the probe (Fig. 3A). The quality of individual subunit proteins was verified by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 3B). Proteins expressed from the N-terminal fragment SAF-1-(1–192) and centrally deleted SAF-1(Δ193–414) showed no DNA binding activity (Fig. 3A, lanes 6 and 10). A high level of DNA binding activity was seen with protein expressed from the 193–414 fragment (Fig. 3A, lane 12), but other proteins expressed from the fragments including 282–414 and 193–361 were also quite active (Fig. 3A, lanes 13 and 14). High level of DNA binding activity was also exhibited by the protein expressed from the SAF-1-(282–361) fragment (Fig. 3A, lane 11). However, carboxyl-terminal protein containing amino acids from 362 to 477 that spans the fifth and sixth zinc fingers of SAF-1 showed no DNA binding activity (Fig. 3A, lane 5). These results suggested that a domain of SAF-1 that spans the second, third, and fourth zinc fingers is necessary for direct interaction with DNA. Noticeably, full-length SAF-1 binds poorly (Fig. 3A, lane 1), but terminal truncation either from the amino-terminal end (Fig. 3A, lane 2) or carboxyl-terminal end (Fig. 3A, lane 7) recovers the DNA binding activity. This finding is consistent with earlier observations described in Fig. 2. Mapping of the Transactivation Domains of SAF-1—To determine whether SAF-1 contains any autonomous transactivation domain, we prepared constructs capable of expressing chimeric proteins containing various segments of SAF-1 fused to the GAL4DBD of yeast GAL4 transcription factor placed under the control of the RSV promoter. GAL4DBDSAF-1 chimeras were tested for their ability to transactivate a CAT reporter gene (Fig. 4). The reporter plasmid (GAL4E1bCAT), shown in Fig. 4A, contains a GAL4 DNA-binding element placed in front of the E1b minimal promoter; therefore, expression of the reporter CAT gene is dependent on the binding of fusion proteins with the help of GAL4DBD and subsequent action of the specific activation domain of the test fusion protein. Amino acids 1–147 of GAL4 protein are sufficient to confer dimerization, binding to GAL4 promoter, and nuclear localization. However, this protein by itself does no"
