https://openalex.org/W1981697359,Layer aluminosilicates catalyze reactions in numerous ways. They stabilize high-energy intermediates. They can store energy in their lattice structures and can release it in the form of chemical energy. They can catalyze redox reactions and can serve as photocatalytic devices. They often exhibit high surface acidity. Organic reactions that are catalyzed by the agency of days are reviewed. The role of clays in prebiotic chemistry is also examined.

It enters metals in the atomic form, diffusing very rapidly even at normal temperatures. During melting and fabrication, as well as during use, there are various ways in which metals come in contact with hydrogen and absorb it. The absorbed hydrogen may react irreversibly with oxides or carbides in some metals to produce a permanently degraded structure. It may also recombine at internal surfaces of defects of various types to form gaseous molecular hydrogen under pressures sufficiently high to form metal blisters when the recombination occurs near the outer surface. In other metals, brittle hydrides that lower the mechanical properties of the metal are formed. Another type of embrittlement is reversible, depending on the presence of hydrogen in the metal lattice during deformation for its occurrence. Under some conditions the failure may be delayed for long periods. A number of different mechanisms have been postulated to explain reversible embrittlement. According to some theories hydrogen interferes with the processes of plastic deformation in metals, while according to others it enhances the tendency for cracking."

Tremolites, actinolites, and hornblendes commonly have lamellae of a calcium-poor clinoamphibole with P2(1)/m space-group symmetry, or lamellae of cummingtonite with C2/m space-group symmetry. Likewise cummingtonites and P2(1)/m clinoamphiboles commonly contain lamellae of calcium-rich C2/m amphiboles such as tremolite. Results of x-ray diffraction, electron-probe, and microscope studies indicate that most lamellae result from unmixing of a homogeneous amphibole. The P2(1)/m clinoamphibole is analogous to the clinopyroxene pigeonite in agreement with the results of M. G. Bown."

https://openalex.org/W2071606892,It has been known for some time that Kestin and his co-workers have reported dilute gas viscosity coefficients which differ from the usually accepted values. Recent work from the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory supplements Kestin's results. We show that there is no evidence for not accepting this different data. We feel that the whole subject of dilute gas viscosity measurements above room temperature should be reexamined both from the experimenter's and correlater's viewpoints. There is evidence that published tables may be incorrect by as much as 10 percent above 600 degrees K.

https://openalex.org/W2068800210,"The U.S. oil and gas industry has been dramatically weakened by the recent oil price collapse. Domestic drilling activity reached a new post-World War II low during the summer of 1986. Given a weak, unstable oil price outlook, U.S. capability will continue to deteriorate. In the last year U.S. imports of foreign oil have risen significantly, and if market forces alone dominate, U.S. dependence is expected to rise from 32% in 1983 to the 50 to 70% level in the not-too-distant future. The 1973 oil embargo and the subsequent attempts to improve U.S. energy security vividly demonstrated the huge costs and long periods of time required to change our energy system. These facts, coupled with the nation's generally short-term orientation, suggest a strong likelihood of a new U.S. energy crisis in the early to middle 1990s."
https://openalex.org/W2051914945,"The data on Venus obtained by Mariner V and Venera 4 are interpreted as evidence of giant polar ice caps holding the water that must have come out of the volcanoes with the observed carbon dioxide, on the assumption that Earth and Venus are of similar composition and volcanic history. The measurements by Venera 4 of the equatorial surface temperature indicate that the microwave readings were high, so that the polar ice caps may be allowed to exist in the face of the 10-centimeter readings of polar temperature. Life seems to be distinctly possible at the edges of the ice sheets."

https://openalex.org/W2082406267,"On the basis of the fact that the youngest neutron stars such as the Crab pulsar and the Vela pulsar emit strong gamma-ray radiation, it is suggested that a few gamma-ray sources may be identified with young compact sources formed in the events of guest stars. Two such sources, 2CG 353+16 and 2CG 054+01, are identified with guest stars observed in the 14th century B.C. and A.D. 1230, respectively."
